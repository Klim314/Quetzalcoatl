TI  == telavancin activity tested against gram-positive clinical isolates from european, russian and israeli hospitals (2011-2013) using a revised broth microdilution testing method: redefining the baseline activity of telavancin.
AB  == objectives: to reassess the activity of telavancin when tested against gram-positive clinical pathogens recovered from hospitalized patients in european and adjacent regions using a revised broth microdilution method. methods: 11 601  consecutive, non-duplicate isolates originating from 36 institutions among 18 countries recovered between 2011 and 2013 were tested for susceptibility using a  revised broth microdilution method for telavancin. interpretive telavancin breakpoints appropriate for the method were those recently approved by the fda and eucast, as available. results: telavancin (mic50/90, 0.03/0.06 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible) was equally potent against methicillin-susceptible ((mssa) and methicillin-resistant (mrsa) staphylococcus aureus. all enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to telavancin (mic50/90, 0.12/0.12 mg/l) and inhibited at the susceptibility breakpoint (i.e. </= 0.25 mg/l), except for vana-phenotype vancomycin-resistant isolates (telavancin mic, >1 mg/l). telavancin ( </= 0.015/0.03 mg/l) was active against vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium,  while higher mic values were obtained for vana strains. telavancin (both mic50 and mic90, </= 0.015 mg/l) was potent against streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-haemolytic streptococci (mic50/90, </= 0.015/0.06 mg/l) and viridans group streptococci (mic50/90, </= 0.015/0.03 mg/l). conclusions: telavancin exhibited potent activity against this contemporary (2011-2013) collection of organisms, inhibiting indicated pathogens at or below the fda/eucast-approved breakpoints for susceptibility. vana-phenotype enterococci were less susceptible to telavancin, a feature observed using the previous testing method. these results redefine telavancin's activity against isolates from europe.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance profile of enterococcus species isolated from intestinal tracts of hospitalized patients in jimma, ethiopia.
AB  == background: multi-drug-resistant enterococci colonizing the intestinal tract of hospitalized patients are the major source of infection as well as nosocomial spread. despite worldwide increasing rate of multidrug resistant enterococci colonization and infection among hospitalized patients, there is scarcity of data from resource limited setting. the present study aimed at determining the antimicrobial resistance profile of enterococcus species from intestinal tracts of hospitalized patients in jimma, ethiopia. methods: the study was conducted among hospitalized patients at jimma university specialized hospital, from january to july 2013. fecal samples were collected and processed for bacterial isolation and susceptibility testing to antimicrobial agents. stool samples were  inoculated onto enterococcus selective media (bile esculin azide agar plate) with and without 6 microg/ml of vancomycin. the isolates were identified to genus and  species level by cultural characteristics, gram's stain, catalase test, growth in 6.5% nacl broth, growth at 45 degrees c, motility test and by using api 20 streptococcus system. sensitivity testing was done using kirby-bauer disk diffusion method. minimum inhibitory concentrations for vancomycin were determined using e-test strips. result: overall, enterococci were isolated from 114 (76%) of the study subjects. the isolates were enterococcus faecium (35.1%) followed by enterococcus faecalis (29.8%), enterococcus gallinarum (17.5%), enterococcus casseliflavus (8.8%) and enterococcus durans (8.8%). among 114 tested enterococci isolates, 41 (36%) were resistant to ampicillin, 62 (54.4%) to streptomycin and 39 (34.2%) to gentamycin. other alternative antibiotics to treat mixed nosocomial infection caused by enterococci also showed high rate of resistance in vitro: ciprofloxacin (50% of resistance), norfloxacin (49.1%), erythromycin (63.2%), tetracycline (64.9%), chloramphenicol (34.2%), and nitrofrantoin (32.4%). multiple drug resistance was observed among 89.5% of e. faecium and e. faecalis. vancomycin resistant enterococci were observed in 5% of  e. faecium isolates. conclusion: this study reveals high rate of fecal colonization by multidrug-resistant enterococci and prevalence of vancomycin resistance strains. thus periodic surveillance of antibacterial susceptibilities  is recommended to detect emerging resistance and to prevent the spread of antibacterial-resistant strains.

TI  == collagen-like peptide sequences inhibit bacterial invasion of root dentine.
AB  == aim: to investigate the effects of peptides derived from the sequence of collagen to inhibit penetration of human or bovine dentine by species of streptococci and  enterococci. methodology: blocks of human or bovine root dentine were infected for 14 d with bacterial cultures, in the presence or absence of various collagen-like peptide sequences. invasion of dentinal tubules was determined from microscopic images of histochemically stained dentine thin sections. extent of invasion was expressed as tubule invasion index (ti), or tubule invasion factor (tif) which, in addition to the density of invasion, took into account the depth  of invasion. data were analyzed by two-way anova. results: streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis were associated with heavy invasion (ti > 2.5, tif > 4) of human or bovine root dentinal tubules, with e. faecalis being the most penetrative. incorporation of peptides gly-pro-ala or  gly-pro-hyp into the in vitro model system significantly reduced (p < 0.05) dentine invasion by the three species of highly-invasive organisms. inhibition of bacterial invasion by the peptides was dose dependent, and the peptides did not inhibit bacterial growth in culture. conclusion: specific collagen-like peptide sequences inhibited the invasion of dentine in vitro by a range of oral bacteria. the peptides likely act as competitive inhibitors blocking bacterial collagen receptors and could potentially allow for target-specific control of dentine infections. this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.

TI  == the cultivable microbiota of primary and secondary infected root canals, their susceptibility to antibiotics and association with the signs and symptoms of infection.
AB  == aim: to examine the presence of microbial species in primary and secondary infections and identify the signs and symptoms associated with them. methodology: a total number of 37 root canals from 33 patients undergoing root canal treatment were selected. samples were taken using a sterile paper point following chemomechanical canal instrumentation. microbiological identification was performed by macromorphological, micromorphological, and commercial biochemical tests (atb system). the antibiotic susceptibility profile of isolated enterococcus, streptococcus and propionibacterium spp. was evaluated. results: a  total number of 54 species were isolated. the most common was e. faecalis followed by propionibacterium acnes and streptococcus spp. five multidrug-resistant enterococcal strains were isolated. however, resistance to linezolid or glycopeptides was not found. radiolucency was observed significantly more often in symptomatic infections (p=0.0061) caused by actinomyces spp. than in asymptomatic ones. conclusions: enterococci and streptococci were the most commonly isolated bacteria from root canals. the resistance of enterococci to many antimicrobials may pose a problem in their eradication. this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of zataria multiflora extract in comparison with chlorhexidine mouthwash on experimentally contaminated orthodontic elastomeric ligatures.
AB  == objectives: long-term use of orthodontic appliances and fixation ligatures creates a favorable environment for the accumulation of oral normal microflora and increases the risk of enamel demineralization and periodontal disease. the aim of this study was to compare the antimicrobial effects of zataria multiflora  extract and 0.2% chlorhexidine (chx) mouthwash on experimentally contaminated orthodontic elastomeric ligatures. materials and methods: in this lab trial study, iranian and foreign-made elastomeric ligatures were experimentally contaminated in streptococcus mutans, enterococcus faecalis and candida albicans  suspensions. ligatures were then decontaminated using 0.2% chx as the control, 0.5 mg/ml zataria multiflora extract mouthwashes as the test and phosphate buffered saline (pbs) as the negative control for one hour. antimicrobial properties of both solutions were evaluated by comparing the mean viable bacterial cell count on both rings after decontamination, using spss version 15 software. results: the mean viable bacterial cell count on iranian ligatures was  greater than that on foreign-made ligatures before disinfection (p=0.001), however this difference for c. albicans was not statistically significant (p=0.061). chlorhexidine mouthwash completely eliminated all tested microorganisms attached to both elastomeric rings, but zataria extract was only capable of completely eliminating c. albicans from both ligatures. statistically  significant differences were found in viable bacterial counts on both ligatures before and after disinfection with zataria extract (p=0.0001). conclusion: zataria multiflora extract has antimicrobial properties and can be used for disinfection of elastomeric ligatures. in vivo studies are required to evaluate the efficacy of the incorporation of this herbal extract in mouthwashes for orthodontic patients.

TI  == bactericidal activity of propylene glycol, glycerine, polyethylene glycol 400, and polyethylene glycol 1000 against selected microorganisms.
AB  == aim: the aim of the present study was to evaluate the bactericidal activity of propylene glycol, glycerine, polyethylene glycol 400 (peg 400), and polyethylene  glycol 1000 (peg 1000) against selected microorganisms in vitro. materials and methods: five vehicles, namely propylene glycol, glycerine, peg 400, peg 1000, and combination of propylene glycol with peg 400, were tested for their bactericidal activity. the minimum bactericidal concentration was noted against four standard strains of organisms, i.e. streptococcus mutans american type culture collection (atcc) 25175, streptococcus mutans atcc 12598, enterococcus faecalis atcc 35550, and escherichia coli atcc 25922, using broth dilution assay. successful endodontic therapy depends upon thorough disinfection of root canals.  in some refractory cases, routine endodontic therapy is not sufficient, so intracanal medicaments are used for proper disinfection of canals. intracanal medicaments are dispensed with vehicles which aid in increased diffusion through  the dentinal tubules and improve their efficacy. among the various vehicles used, glycerine is easily available, whereas others like propylene glycol and polyethylene glycol have to be procured from appropriate sources. also, these vehicles, being viscous, aid in sustained release of the medicaments and improve  their handling properties. the most commonly used intracanal medicaments like calcium hydroxide are ineffective on many microorganisms, while most of the other medicaments like mtad (mixture of tetracycline, an acid, and a detergent) and triple antibiotic paste (tap) consist of antibiotics which can lead to development of antibiotic resistance among microorganisms. thus, in order to use  safer and equally effective intracanal medicaments, newer alternatives like chlorhexidine gluconate, ozonized water, etc., are being explored. similarly, the five vehicles mentioned above are being tested for their antimicrobial activity in this study. results: all vehicles exhibited bactericidal activity at 100% concentration. conclusion: propylene glycol was effective against three organisms namely s. mutans e. faecalis and e. coli and its bactericidal activity was at 50%, 25% and 50% respectively. peg 1000 was effective against s. mutans and e. coli at 25%. hence propylene glycol was effective on more number of organisms of  which e. faecalis is a known resistant species. peg 1000 was bactericidal at a lower concentration but was effective on two organisms only.

TI  == a derivative of the thiopeptide ge2270a highly selective against propionibacterium acnes.
AB  == a chemical derivative of the thiopeptide ge2270a, designated nai003, was found to possess a substantially reduced antibacterial spectrum in comparison to the parent compound, being active against just a few gram-positive bacteria. in particular, nai003 retained low mics against all tested isolates of propionibacterium acnes and, to a lesser extent, against enterococcus faecalis. furthermore, nai003 showed a time- and dose-dependent killing of both a clindamycin-resistant and a clindamycin-sensitive p. acnes isolate. gel-shift experiments indicated that, like the parent compound, nai003 retained the ability to bind to elongation factors (ef) tu derived from escherichia coli, e. faecalis  or p. acnes, albeit with reduced efficiency. in contrast, ef-tu's derived from the nai003-insenstitive staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus pyogenes did not bind this compound. these results were confirmed by in vitro studies using a hybrid translation system, which indicated that nai003 can inhibit most efficiently protein synthesis driven by the p. acnes ef-tu. p. acnes mutants resistant to nai003 were isolated by direct plating. with one exception, all analyzed strains carried mutation in the tuf gene, encoding ef-tu. because of its selective effect on p. acnes in comparison to resident skin flora, nai003 represents a promising candidate for the topical treatment of acne, which has already completed a phase 1 clinical study.

TI  == decade-long use of the antimicrobial peptide combination tyrothricin does not pose a major risk of acquired resistance with gram-positive bacteria and candida  spp.
AB  == tyrothricin, an antimicrobial peptide combination produced by bacillus brevis consisting of gramicidins and tyrocidins commands broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria and some yeasts in vitro. the polypeptide and its  components have been used therapeutically for about 60 years in the local treatment of infected skin and infected oro-pharyngeal mucous membranes. though older studies suggest that resistance development of originally susceptible microorganisms towards tyrothricin is a rare event, data concerning recent state  of resistance are lacking. in the present in vitro study the susceptibility to tyrothricin of clinical isolates of bacterial and yeast origin from superficial swabs of the skin and mucous membranes of outpatients and inpatients obtained from clinical material in the second half of the year 2003 was determined. using  a microdilution assay, the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic and mic90, defined as the concentration that inhibits at least 90 percent of the tested strains) of 20 strains each of staphylococcus aureus of the variety mssa (susceptible to methicillin), staphylococcus aureus of the variety mrsa (methicillin resistant), staphylococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, corynebacterium spec., candida albicans and candida parapsilosis was determined. all of the tested gram-positive bacteria turned out  to be highly susceptible to tyrothricin with mics </= 4mg/l. the tested yeast strains were susceptible to the polypeptide antibiotic as well, but (with mics of 16 mg/l and 32 mg/l, respectively) to a lesser extent. no acquired resistance of  the tested strains was determined, indicating that the risk of resistance development against topically applied tyrothricin is only marginal, if there is any at all. thus, long-term-, i.e. decade-long use of topically applied tyrothricin and its components in the local treatment of infected skin does not pose a major risk with respect to acquired resistance of originally susceptible gram-positive bacteria and yeasts, not even in the case of staphylococcus aureus, both with mssa and mrsa strains. the broad anti-bacterial and anti-fungal activity of tyrothricin combined with its lacking risk for resistance development make the antimicrobial peptide a valuable addition to our therapeutic armamentarium in the treatment of infected skin.

TI  == global in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents: tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial 2004-2013.
AB  == background: the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test) is a global  antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance study which has been ongoing since 2004. this report examines the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparators against clinically important pathogens collected globally between 2004 and 2013.  methods: antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using guidelines published by the clinical and laboratory standards institute. the cochran armitage trend test was used to identify statistically significant changes in susceptibility between 2004 and 2013. results: among the enterobacteriaceae susceptibility was highest to the carbapenems [imipenem 97.1% (24,655/25,381), meropenem 97.0% (90,714/93,518)], tigecycline (97.0%, 115,361/118,899) and amikacin (96.9%, 115,200/118,899). against acinetobacter baumannii the highest rates of susceptibility were for minocycline (84.5%, 14,178/16,778) and imipenem (80.0%, 3,037/3,795). the mic90 for tigecycline was 2 mg/l. 40% (6,743/16,778) of a. baumannii isolates were multidrug-resistant. enterococci were highly susceptible  to tigecycline and linezolid (>99%); vancomycin resistance was observed among 2%  of enterococcus faecalis (325/14,615) and 35% of enterococcus faecium (2,136/6,167) globally. 40% (14,647/36,448) of staphylococcus aureus were methicillin-resistant while 15% (2,152/14,562) of streptococcus pneumoniae were penicillin-resistant. against s. aureus and s. pneumoniae susceptibility to linezolid, vancomycin, and tigecycline was >/=99.9%. globally, 81% (331/410) of statistically significant susceptibility changes during the study period were decreases in susceptibility. conclusions: amikacin, the carbapenems, and tigecycline were active against most gram-negative pathogens while linezolid, tigecycline, and vancomycin retained activity against most gram-positive pathogens collected in test during 2004-2013.

TI  == total and specific bacterial levels in the apical root canal system of teeth with post-treatment apical periodontitis.
AB  == introduction: most studies of the microbiota in root canal-treated teeth focused  only on the main canal, not distinguishing regions nor incorporating the intricate anatomy in the analysis. moreover, most of them provided only prevalence data. this study was designed to evaluate the total bacterial counts and the presence, levels, and relative abundance of candidate endodontic pathogens exclusively in the apical root canal system associated with post-treatment apical periodontitis. methods: apical root specimens obtained during periradicular surgery of 27 adequately treated teeth with persistent apical periodontitis were cryogenically ground. dna was extracted from the powder, and real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify the total bacteria and 7 bacterial taxa. results: samples from 21 teeth were positive for bacteria. streptococcus species were the most prevalent (76%) followed by members of the actinobacteria phylum (52%) and pseudoramibacter alactolyticus (19%). the  mean total bacterial load in the apical root segments was 5.7 x 104 cell equivalents per root apex (or 2.1 x 104/100 mg root powder). streptococci comprised from 0.02%-99.9% of the total bacterial counts, actinobacteria from 0.02%-84.7%, and p. alactolyticus from 67.9%-99%. although enterococcus faecalis  was found in only 3 (14%) cases, it was dominant in 2. conclusions: streptococcus species, members of the actinobacteria phylum, and p. alactolyticus were the most prevalent taxa in the apical canal system and dominated the bacterial populations in many cases of post-treatment apical periodontitis.

TI  == evaluation of regional antibiograms to monitor antimicrobial resistance in hampton roads, virginia.
AB  == we studied recent antibiograms (2010 to 2011) from 12 hospitals in the hampton roads area, virginia, that refer patients to a tertiary-care facility affiliated  with eastern virginia medical school. the data was compiled into a regional antibiogram, and sensitivity rates of common isolates from the tertiary-care facility (central) were compared to those of referring hospitals grouped by locale. staphylococcus aureus was the most common gram- positive and e. coli the  most common gram- negative organism grown from clinical samples in the area. overall 53% of s.aureus isolates were resistant to oxacillin. there was a broad scatter of mic (minimum inhibitory concentration) for vancomycin within the susceptibility range, and mic of 4 mug/ml was reported in 2012. penicillin resistance was seen in 50% and erythromycin resistance in 45% of streptococcus pneumoniae. vancomycin resistance was seen in 75% of enterococcus faecium and 2%  of enterococcus faecalis respectively. acinetobacter baumannii was the most resistant gram negative organism in the data compiled. among the escherichia coli, 26%, 44% and 52%were resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole ( sxt) ampicillin- sulbactam and ampicillin respectively. we found significant differences in methodology, interpretation and antibiotic panels used by area laboratories. based on these findings, we are now prospectively following resistance patterns in the tertiary-care facility, sharing data, and creating a consistent approach to antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the region.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of apitoxin, melittin and phospholipase a(2) of honey bee  (apis mellifera) venom against oral pathogens.
AB  == in this work, we used the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) technique to evaluate the antibacterial potential of the apitoxin produced by apis mellifera bees against the causative agents of tooth decay. apitoxin was assayed in natura  and in the commercially available form. the antibacterial actions of the main components of this apitoxin, phospholipase a2, and melittin were also assessed, alone and in combination. the following bacteria were tested: streptococcus salivarius, s. sobrinus, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. sanguinis, lactobacillus casei,  and enterococcus faecalis. the mic results obtained for the commercially available apitoxin and for the apitoxin in natura were close and lay between 20 and 40 microg / ml, which indicated good antibacterial activity. melittin was the most active component in apitoxin; it displayed very promising mic values, from 4 to 40 microg / ml. phospholipase a2 presented mic values higher than 400 microg / ml. association of mellitin with phospholipase a2 yielded mic values ranging between 6 and 80 microg / ml. considering that tooth decay affects people's health, apitoxin and its component melittin have potential application against oral pathogens.

TI  == biodiversity and gamma-aminobutyric acid production by lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional alpine raw cow's milk cheeses.
AB  == "nostrano-cheeses" are traditional alpine cheeses made from raw cow's milk in trentino-alto adige, italy. this study identified lactic acid bacteria (lab) developing during maturation of "nostrano-cheeses" and evaluated their potential  to produce gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba), an immunologically active compound and neurotransmitter. cheese samples were collected on six cheese-making days, in three dairy factories located in different areas of trentino and at different stages of cheese ripening (24 h, 15 days, and 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 months). a total  of 1,059 lab isolates were screened using random amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) and differentiated into 583 clusters. lab strains from dominant clusters (n = 97) were genetically identified to species level by partial 16s rrna gene sequencing. lab species most frequently isolated were lactobacillus paracasei, streptococcus thermophilus, and leuconostoc mesenteroides. the 97 dominant clusters were also characterized for their ability in producing gaba by  high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). about 71% of the dominant bacteria clusters evolving during cheeses ripening were able to produce gaba. most gaba producers were lactobacillus paracasei but other gaba producing species included  lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, pediococcus pentosaceus, and streptococcus thermophilus. no enterococcus faecalis or sc. macedonicus isolates produced gaba. the isolate producing the highest amount of gaba (80.0+/-2.7 mg/kg) was a sc. thermophilus.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of plectasin nz2114 in combination with cell wall targeting antibiotics against vana-type enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == antimicrobial peptide plectasin targeting bacterial cell wall precursor lipid ii  has been reported to be active against benzylpenicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae but less potent against vancomycin-resistant enterococci than their susceptible counterparts. the aim of this work was to test plectasin nz2114 in combination with cell wall targeting antibiotics on vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis. the activity of antibiotic combinations was evaluated against vana-type vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis strain bm4110/pip816-1 by disk agar-induction, double-disk assay, determination of fractional inhibitory concentration (fic) index, and time-kill curve. the results indicated that plectasin nz2114 was synergistic in combination with teicoplanin, moenomycin, and dalbavancin but not with vancomycin, telavancin, penicillin g, bacitracin, ramoplanin, daptomycin, and fosfomycin. to gain an insight into the synergism, we tested other cell wall antibiotic combinations. interestingly, synergy was observed between teicoplanin or moenomycin and the majority of the antibiotics tested; however, vancomycin was only synergistic with penicillin g. other cell wall active antibiotics such as ramoplanin, bacitracin, and fosfomycin did not synergize. it appeared that most of the synergies observed involved inhibition of the transglycosylation step in peptidoglycan synthesis. these results suggest that teicoplanin, dalbavancin, vancomycin, and telavancin, although they all bind to the c-terminal d-ala-d-ala of lipid ii, might act on different stages of cell  wall synthesis.

TI  == quantitative profiling of colorectal cancer-associated bacteria reveals associations between fusobacterium spp., enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis (etbf) and clinicopathological features of colorectal cancer.
AB  == various studies have presented clinical or in vitro evidence linking bacteria to  colorectal cancer, but these bacteria have not previously been concurrently quantified by qpcr in a single cohort. we quantify these bacteria (fusobacterium  spp., streptococcus gallolyticus, enterococcus faecalis, enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis (etbf), enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec), and afac-  or pks-positive e. coli) in paired tumour and normal tissue samples from 55 colorectal cancer patients. we further investigate the relationship between a) the presence and b) the level of colonisation of each bacterial species with site and stage of disease, age, gender, ethnicity and msi-status. with the exception of s. gallolyticus, we detected all bacteria profiled here in both tumour and normal samples at varying frequencies. etbf (fdr = 0.001 and 0.002 for normal and tumour samples) and afac-positive e. coli (fdr = 0.03, normal samples) were significantly enriched in the colon compared to the rectum. etbf (fdr = 0.04 and  0.002 for normal and tumour samples, respectively) and fusobacterium spp. (fdr =  0.03 tumour samples) levels were significantly higher in late stage (iii/iv) colorectal cancers. fusobacterium was by far the most common bacteria detected, occurring in 82% and 81% of paired tumour and normal samples. fusobacterium was also the only bacterium that was significantly higher in tumour compared to normal samples (p = 6e-5). we also identified significant associations between high-level colonisation by fusobacterium and msi-h (fdr = 0.05), age (fdr = 0.03) or pks-positive e. coli (fdr = 0.01). furthermore, we exclusively identified atypical epec in our cohort, which has not been previously reported in association with colorectal cancer. by quantifying colorectal cancer-associated bacteria across a single cohort, we uncovered inter- and intra-individual patterns of colonization not previously recognized, as well as important associations with clinicopathological features, especially in the case of fusobacterium and etbf.

TI  == the effect of indomethacin and betamethasone on the cytokine response of human neonatal mononuclear cells to gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == intrauterine infections with gram-positive bacteria pose a serious threat to neonates since they can result in neonatal sepsis, induce a fetal inflammatory response and also cause preterm birth. despite intensive care, prematurity remains a leading cause of neonatal death, and is often accompanied by a number of morbidities. in order to prevent premature birth, tocolytic agents like indomethacin are administered. betamethasone is used to promote lung maturation and prevent respiratory distress syndrome. a combination of both drugs is assumed to prevent premature delivery while simultaneously facilitating lung maturation.  this study investigates the effect of betamethasone, indomethacin and a combination of both on the cytokine production of neonatal cord blood mononuclear cells (cbmc) after stimulation with lysates of the gram-positive pathogens streptococcus agalactiae and enterococcus faecalis. the aim of the study is to determine the impact of these drugs on the function of the neonatal immune system which should aid clinicians in choosing the optimal therapy in case of preterm birth associated with intrauterine infection. betamethasone reduced the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines il-6, il-12p40, mip-1alpha and tnf and increased the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10, depending on the pathogen used for stimulation. in contrast to betamethasone, indomethacin  almost exclusively increased il-10 production. the combination of both drugs decreased the expression of il-6, il-12p40, mip-1alpha and tnf while increasing il-10 production, depending on the concentration of indomethacin and the pathogen used for stimulation. based on our results, the combination therapy with indomethacin and betamethasone has a similar effect on cytokine production as betamethasone alone, which is generally administered in case of impending preterm birth. however, the combination therapy has the advantage of promoting lung maturation while simultaneously blocking preterm labor effectively.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of anacardium occidentale and mangifera indica in oral care.
AB  == background: oral health is an integral and important component of general health. infectious diseases such as caries, periodontal, and gingivitis indicate the onset of imbalance in homeostasis between oral micro biota and host. the present  day medicaments used in oral health care have numerous side effects. the uses of  herbal plants as an alternative have gained popularity due to side effects of antibiotics and emergence of multidrug resistant strains. anacardium occidentale  (cashew) and mangifera indica (mango) have been used as traditional oral health care measures in india since time immemorial. materials and methods: the ethanol  extracts of cashew and mango leaves were obtained by maceration method. the antimicrobial activity was evaluated by clear zone produced by these plant extracts against enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, escherichia coli, and candida albicans in agar plate method, determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentration (mbc/mfc), and suppression of biofilm. the  cytotoxic effects of plants extract was determined by microculture tetrazolium assay on human gingival fibroblast and chinese hamster lung fibroblast (v79) cell lines. results: cashew and mango leaf extract significantly (p < 0.05) produced larger zone of inhibition against test pathogens when compared to povidone-iodine-based mouth rinses. although the mic and mbc/mfc values of mouth  rinses were effective in lower concentrations; plant extracts significantly (p <  0.001) suppressed the biofilms of oral pathogens. the leaf extracts were less cytotoxic (p < 0.001) compared to mouth rinses. conclusions: plant extracts are superior to the mouth rinses and have a promising role in future oral health care.

TI  == bactericidal activity and mechanism of photoirradiated polyphenols against gram-positive and -negative bacteria.
AB  == the bactericidal effect of various types of photoirradiated polyphenols against gram-positive and -negative bacteria was evaluated in relation to the mode of action. gram-positive bacteria (enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus mutans) and gram-negative bacteria (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) suspended in a 1 mg/ml polyphenol aqueous solution (caffeic acid, gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin gallate, and proanthocyanidin) were exposed to led light (wavelength, 400 nm; irradiance, 260 mw/cm2) for 5 or 10 min. caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid exerted the highest bactericidal activity  followed by gallic acid and proanthocyanidin against both gram-positive and -negative bacteria. it was also demonstrated that the disinfection treatment induced oxidative damage of bacterial dna, which suggests that polyphenols are incorporated into bacterial cells. the present study suggests that blue light irradiation of polyphenols could be a novel disinfection treatment.

TI  == utilization of blood cultures in danish hospitals: a population-based descriptive analysis.
AB  == this national population-based study was conducted as part of the development of  a national automated surveillance system for hospital-acquired bacteraemia and ascertains the utilization of blood cultures (bcs). a primary objective was to understand how local differences may affect interpretation of nationwide surveillance for bacteraemia. from the danish microbiology database, we retrieved all bcs taken between 2010 and 2013 and linked these to admission data from the national patient registry. in total, 4 587 295 admissions were registered, and in 11%, at least one bc was taken. almost 50% of bcs were taken at admission. the chance of having a bc taken declined over the next days but increased after 4 days of admission. data linkage identified 876 290 days on which at least one bc  was taken; 6.4% yielded positive results. ten species, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella oxytoca, accounted for 74.7% of agents for this purpose classified as pathogenic. an increase in bcs and positive bcs was observed over time, particularly among older patients. bcs showed a seasonal pattern overall and for s. pneumoniae particularly. a predominance of male patients was seen for bacteraemias due to s. aureus, e. faecium and k. pneumoniae. minor differences in bcs and positive bcs between departments of clinical microbiology underpin the rationale of a future automated surveillance for bacteraemia. the study also provides important knowledge for interpretation of surveillance of invasive infections more generally.

TI  == antibiotic resistance prevalence in routine bloodstream isolates from children's  hospitals varies substantially from adult surveillance data in europe.
AB  == background: surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (amr) is central for defining appropriate strategies to deal with changing amr levels. it is unclear whether childhood amr patterns differ from those detected in isolates from adult  patients. methods: resistance percentages of nonduplicate staphylococcus aureus,  streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa bloodstream isolates from children less than 18 years of age reported to the antibiotic resistance and prescribing in european children (arpec) project were compared with all-age resistance percentages reported by the european antimicrobial resistance surveillance network (ears-net) for the same pathogen-antibiotic class combinations, period and countries. in addition, resistance percentages were compared between arpec isolates from children less than 1 year of age and children greater than or equal to1 year of age. results: resistance percentages for many important pathogen-antibiotic class combinations were different for arpec isolates compared with ears-net. e. coli and k. pneumoniae fluoroquinolone  resistance percentages were substantially lower in arpec (13.4% and 17.9%) than in ears-net (23.0% and 30.7%), whereas the reverse was true for all pathogen-antibiotic class combinations in p. aeruginosa (for example, 27.3% aminoglycoside resistance in arpec, 19.3% in ears-net, 32.8% carbapenem resistance in arpec and 20.5% in ears-net), and for s. pneumoniae and macrolide resistance. for many gram-negative pathogen-antibiotic class combinations, isolates from children greater than or equal to 1 year of age showed higher resistance percentages than isolates from children less than 1 year of age. conclusions: age-stratified presentation of resistance percentage estimates by surveillance programs will allow identification of important variations in resistance patterns between different patient groups for targeted intervention.

TI  == integration of non-oral bacteria into in vitro oral biofilms.
AB  == biofilms are polymicrobial communities that grow on surfaces in nature. oral bacteria can spontaneously form biofilms on the surface of teeth, which may compromise the health of the teeth, or their surrounding (periodontal) tissues. while the oral bacteria exhibit high tropism for their specialized ecological niche, it is not clear if bacteria that are not part of the normal oral microbiota can efficiently colonize and grow within oral biofilms. by using an in vitro "supragingival" biofilm model of 6 oral species, this study aimed to investigate if 3 individual bacterial species that are not part of the normal oral microbiota (eschericia coli, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecails) and one not previously tested oral species (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) can be incorporated into this established supragingival biofilm model. staphylococcus aureus and a. actinomycetemcomitans were able to grow efficiently in the biofilm, without disrupting the growth of the remaining species. they localized in sparse small aggregates within the biofilm mass. enterococcus faecalis and e. coli were both able to populate the biofilm at high  numbers, and suppressed the growth of a. oris and s. mutants. enterococcus faecalis was arranged in a chain-like conformation, whereas e. coli was densely and evenly spread throughout the biofilm mass. in conclusion, it is possible for  selected species that are not part of the normal oral microbiota to be introduced into an oral biofilm, under the given experimental micro-environmental conditions. moreover, the equilibrated incorporation of a. actinomycetemcomitans  and s. aureus in this oral biofilm model could be a useful tool in the study of aggressive periodontitis and peri-implantitis, in which these organisms are involved, respectively.

TI  == synergistic effect of 2% chlorhexidine combined with proteolytic enzymes on biofilm disruption and killing.
AB  == aim: to investigate the dynamics of a disinfection regimen using 1% trypsin and 1% proteinase k in combination with 2% chlorhexidine (with or without ultrasonics) using a nutrient-stressed endodontic multispecies model biofilm. methodology: nutrient-stressed biofilms (propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus  epidermidis, actinomyces radicidentis, streptococcus mitis and enterococcus faecalis omgs 3202) were grown in prepared root canals of single-rooted teeth. the treatment groups included 1% trypsin and 2% chlorhexidine (chx), 1% proteinase k and 2% chx (with and without ultrasonics). 2% chx was the positive control and untreated group, and sterile saline (with and without ultrasonics) was the negative control. the biofilms were investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) with live/dead staining and quantitative microbial culture. results: the trypsin and chx group with ultrasonics was significantly more effective in reducing viable counts and the substratum coverage than those of all other groups (p < 0.05). the viable counts of the proteinase k and chx group used with (4.26 +/- 0.58 log10 cfu ml-1 ) or without ultrasonics (5.05 +/-  1.36 log10 cfu ml-1 ) were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) as compared with the  untreated control (7.67 +/- 0.84 log10 cfu ml-1 ) and saline groups used with (6.57 +/- 0.73 log10 cfu ml-1 ) and without ultrasonics (6.74 +/- 0.10 log10 cfu  ml-1 ). the chx group was less effective in biofilm disruption compared to when used in combination with trypsin and proteinase k. conclusion: the trypsin and chx group with ultrasonics was significantly more effective at reducing bacterial viable counts and disrupting biofilm.

TI  == biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles using ethanolic petals extract of rosa indica and characterization of its antibacterial, anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities.
AB  == the present study was aimed at biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (agnps) using ethanolic extract of rose (rosa indica) petals and testing their potential antibacterial activity using selective human pathogenic microbes, anticancer activity using human colon adenocarcinoma cancer cell line hct 15 as well as anti-inflammatory activity using rat peritoneal macrophages in vitro. the biologically synthesized agnps were also characterized by uv-visible spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (sem), transmission electron microscopy (tem), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir), energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (edx) and x-ray diffraction (xrd). the characterized agnps showed an effective antibacterial activity against gram negative (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae) than gram positive (streptococcus mutans, enterococcus faecalis) bacteria. mtt assay, analysis of nuclear morphology, mrna expression of bcl-2, bax and protein expression of caspase 3 as well as 9, indicated potential anticancer activity. in addition, green synthesized agnps also attenuated cytotoxicity, nuclear morphology and free radical generation (o2(-) and no) by rat peritoneal macrophages in vitro. the results of our study show the potential green synthesis of silver nanoparticles in mitigating their toxicity while retaining their antibacterial activities.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of different filling pastes for deciduous tooth treatment.
AB  == guedes-pinto paste is the filling material most employed in brazil for endodontic treatment of deciduous teeth; however, the rifocort(r) ointment has been removed. thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial potential of filling pastes, by proposing three new pharmacological associations to replace rifocort(r) ointment with drugs of already established antimicrobial power: nebacetin(r) ointment, 2% chlorhexidine gluconate gel, and maxitrol(r) ointment.  a paste composed of iodoform, rifocort(r) ointment and camphorated paramonochlorophenol (cpc) was employed as the gold standard (g1). the other associations were: iodoform, nebacetin(r) ointment and cpc (g2); iodoform, 2% chlorhexidine digluconate gel and cpc (g3); iodoform, maxitrol(r) ointment and cpc (g4). the associations were tested for staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), streptococcus mutans (s. mutans), streptococcus oralis (s. oralis), enterococcus  faecalis (e. faecalis), escherichia coli (e. coli), and bacillus subtilis (b. subtilis), using the methods of dilution on solid medium - orifice agar - and broth dilution. the results were tested using statistical analysis anova and kruskal-wallis. they showed that all the pastes had a bacteriostatic effect on all the microorganisms, without any statistically significant difference, compared with g1. s. aureus was statistically significant (multiple comparison test of tukey), insofar as g2 and g3 presented the worst and the best performance, respectively. all associations were bactericidal for e. coli, s. aureus, s. mutans and s. oralis. only g3 and g4 were bactericidal for e. faecalis, whereas no product was bactericidal for b. subtilis. thus, the tested pastes have antimicrobial potential and have proved acceptable for endodontic treatment of primary teeth.

TI  == isolation and identification of symbiotic bacteria from the skin, mouth, and rectum of wild and captive tree shrews.
AB  == endosymbionts influence many aspects of their hosts' health conditions, including physiology, development, immunity, metabolism, etc. tree shrews (tupaia belangeri chinensis) have attracted increasing attention in modeling human diseases and therapeutic responses due to their close relationship with primates. to clarify the situation of symbiotic bacteria from their body surface, oral cavity, and anus, 12 wild and 12 the third generation of captive tree shrews were examined. based on morphological and cultural characteristics, physiological and biochemical tests, as well as the 16s rdna full sequence analysis, 12 bacteria strains were isolated and identified from the wild tree shrews: body surface: bacillus subtilis (detection rate 42%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (25%), staphlococcus aureus (33%), s. epidermidis (75%), micrococcus luteus (25%), kurthia gibsonii (17%); oral cavity: neisseria mucosa (58%), streptococcus pneumonia (17%); anus: enterococcus faecalis (17%), lactococus lactis (33%), escherichia coli (92%), salmonella typhosa (17%); whereas, four were indentified  from the third generation captive tree shrews: body surface: s. epidermidis (75%); oral cavity: n.mucosa (67%); anus: l. lactis (33%), e. coli (100%). these  results indicate that s. epidermidis, n. mucosa, l. lactis and e. coli were major bacteria in tree shrews, whereas, s. aureus, m. luteus, k. gibsonii, e. faecalis  and s. typhosa were species-specific flora. this study facilitates the future use of tree shrews as a standard experimental animal and improves our understanding of the relationship between endosymbionts and their hosts.

TI  == antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties of pgla-am1, cpf-am1, and magainin-am1: potent activity against oral pathogens.
AB  == cationic amphipathic alpha-helical peptides are intensively studied classes of host defence peptides (hdps). three peptides, peptide glycine-leucine-amide (pgla-am1), caerulein-precursor fragment (cpf-am1) and magainin-am1, originally isolated from norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the african volcano frog xenopus amieti (pipidae), were studied for their antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities against oral and respiratory pathogens. minimal effective concentrations (mecs), determined by radial diffusion assay, were generally lower than minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) determined by microbroth dilution. pgla-am1 and cpf-am1 were particularly active against streptococcus mutans and all three peptides were effective against fusobacterium  nucleatum, whereas enterococcus faecalis and candida albicans proved to be relatively resistant micro-organisms. a type strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa was shown to be more susceptible than the clinical isolate studied. pgla-am1 displayed the greatest propensity to bind lipopolysaccharide (lps) from escherichia coli, p. aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis. all three peptides  showed less binding to p. gingivalis lps than to lps from the other species studied. oral fibroblast viability was unaffected by 50 mum peptide treatments. production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine il-8 by oral fibroblasts was significantly increased following treatment with 1 or 10 mum magainin-am1 but not following treatment with pgla-am1 or cpf-am1. in conclusion, as well as possessing potent antimicrobial actions, the x. amieti peptides bound to lps from three human pathogens and had no effect on oral fibroblast viability. cpf-am1 and pgla-am1 show promise as templates for the design of novel analogues for the treatment of oral and dental diseases associated with bacteria or fungi.

TI  == antibacterial compounds from salvia adenophora fernald (lamiaceae).
AB  == from the aerial parts of salvia adenophora fernald four derivatives of 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (1-4) together with five clerodane diterpenoids (5, 6, 8-10), and one known diterpene (7) have been isolated. compounds 1-6 and 8-10 are described for the first time. the structures were established by extensive 1d, 2d nmr and hresi-tofms spectroscopic methods. finally, the absolute configuration has been established by comparing of experimental and quantum chemical calculation of ecd spectra. despite a total lack of antimicrobial activity of the plant extract, hinting to the existence of antagonistic interactions in the crude material, three oxylipins (2-4) displayed a promising inhibition on gram-positive multidrug-resistant clinical strains including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae and, particularly, staphylococcus epidermidis, while the compounds 9 and 10 revealed a specific and strain-dependent activity against s. epidermidis. interestingly, the inhibition provided by these compounds was independent of the resistance patterns of these pathogens to classic antibiotics. no action was reported on gram-negative strains nor on candida albicans. these results confirm that clerodanes and, particularly, prostaglandin-like compounds can be considered as interesting antimicrobial agents deserving further study.

TI  == an in vivo comparison of internal bacterial colonization in two dental implant systems: identification of a pathogenic reservoir.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to compare internal bacterial colonization  in two implant systems, one screw root form (srf) with an external hexagon connection and one plateau root form (prf) with a morse taper internal connection. materials and methods: thirty-two implants; 12 srf and 20 prf, were sampled in 15 patients. all implants had been in function for at least 6 months prior to sampling. the implant restoration was removed and 10 microl of sterile saline was introduced into the implant well via a sterile glass syringe. the saline was drawn back up and transferred to the laboratory for microbiological analysis. the number of aerobic and anaerobic colony forming units per millilitre was determined and the dominant micro-organism in each sample was identified by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing. results: there was a significant difference between bleeding on probing around the srf implants (3%) and the prf implants (28%) (p = 0.0496). bacterial colonization was identified at 11 srf and 19 prf implants. the numbers of anaerobic bacteria recovered from prf implants was significantly higher than that from srf implants (p = 0.0002). streptococcus species and enterococcus faecalis were found to dominate. conclusions: this in vivo study demonstrated bacterial colonization in both types of implant systems,  irrespective of the type of connection. significantly greater anaerobic counts were found in the morse taper internal connection implants.

TI  == bacteriocin protein bacl1 of enterococcus faecalis targets cell division loci and specifically recognizes l-ala2-cross-bridged peptidoglycan.
AB  == bacteriocin 41 (bac41) is produced from clinical isolates of enterococcus faecalis and consists of two extracellular proteins, bacl1 and baca. we previously reported that bacl1 protein (595 amino acids, 64.5 kda) is a bacteriolytic peptidoglycan d-isoglutamyl-l-lysine endopeptidase that induces cell lysis of e. faecalis when an accessory factor, baca, is copresent. however,  the target of bacl1 remains unknown. in this study, we investigated the targeting specificity of bacl1. fluorescence microscopy analysis using fluorescent dye-conjugated recombinant protein demonstrated that bacl1 specifically localized at the cell division-associated site, including the equatorial ring, division septum, and nascent cell wall, on the cell surface of target e. faecalis cells. this specific targeting was dependent on the triple repeat of the sh3 domain located in the region from amino acid 329 to 590 of bacl1. repression of cell growth due to the stationary state of the growth phase or to treatment with bacteriostatic antibiotics rescued bacteria from the bacteriolytic activity of bacl1 and baca. the static growth state also abolished the binding and targeting  of bacl1 to the cell division-associated site. furthermore, the targeting of bacl1 was detectable among gram-positive bacteria with an l-ala-l-ala-cross-bridging peptidoglycan, including e. faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, or streptococcus pneumoniae, but not among bacteria with alternate peptidoglycan structures, such as enterococcus faecium, enterococcus hirae, staphylococcus aureus, or listeria monocytogenes. these data suggest that bacl1 specifically targets the l-ala-l-ala-cross-bridged peptidoglycan and potentially  lyses the e. faecalis cells during cell division.

TI  == antibiofilm efficacy of photosensitizer-functionalized bioactive nanoparticles on multispecies biofilm.
AB  == introduction: newer disinfection strategies based on antibacterial nanoparticles  and photodynamic therapy (pdt) aim to eliminate residual biofilm bacteria during  root canal treatment. the aim of the current study was to test the newly developed rose bengal-functionalized chitosan nanoparticles (csrbnps) for their interaction/uptake with monospecies bacteria/biofilm and assess their antibiofilm efficacy on a multispecies biofilm model in vitro. methods: the interaction of csrbnps with bacterial cells was conducted using atomic force microscopy. their membrane-damaging effect was determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm (od260nm) using enterococcus faecalis. the penetration of csrbnps into e. faecalis biofilms was evaluated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm).  multispecies biofilms of streptococcus oralis, prevotella intermedia, and actinomyces naeslundii were grown on dentin sections for 21 days to assess the antibiofilm efficacy. the biofilms were subjected to pdt (60 j/cm(2)) using csrbnps and rose bengal. the treated/untreated biofilms were examined under scanning electron microscopy and clsm. results: the csrbnps synthesized were 60 +/- 20 nm and showed absorption spectra similar to rose bengal. atomic force microscopy showed adherence of csrbnps to bacteria, roughening of cell surface, and cell disruption after pdt. csrbnp treatment resulted in significantly increased bacterial membrane damage (p < .05). csrbnps exhibited deeper penetration into the biofilm structure. scanning electron microscopy and clsm confirmed the complete disruption of multispecies biofilm with a reduction in viable bacteria and biofilm thickness (p < .05). conclusions: these novel photosensitizer functionalized bioactive nanoparticles with increased affinity to bacterial cell membrane, higher penetration into biofilm structure, and enhanced  ability to eliminate clinically relevant multispecies bacterial biofilm present a potential antibiofilm agent for root canal disinfection.

TI  == plasma components and platelet activation are essential for the antimicrobial properties of autologous platelet-rich plasma: an in vitro study.
AB  == autologous platelet concentrates are successfully adopted in a variety of medical fields to stimulate bone and soft tissue regeneration. the rationale for their use consists in the delivery of a wide range of platelet-derived bioactive molecules that promotes wound healing. in addition, antimicrobial properties of platelet concentrates have been pointed out. in this study, the effect of the platelet concentration, of the activation step and of the presence of plasmatic components on the antimicrobial activity of pure platelet-rich plasma was investigated against gram positive bacteria isolated from oral cavity. the antibacterial activity, evaluated as the minimum inhibitory concentration, was determined through the microdilution two-fold serial method. results seem to suggest that the antimicrobial activity of platelet-rich plasma against enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus oralis and staphylococcus aureus is sustained by a co-operation between plasma components and platelet-derived factors and that the activation of coagulation is a fundamental step. the findings of this study may have practical implications in the modality of application of platelet concentrates.

TI  == control of tyramine and histamine accumulation by lactic acid bacteria using bacteriocin forming lactococci.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the competitive effects of three bacteriocin producing strains of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis against two aminobiogenic lactic acid bacteria, i.e. the tyramine producing strain enterococcus faecalis ef37 and the histamine producing strain streptococcus thermophilus pri60, inoculated at different initial concentrations (from 2 to 6 log cfu/ml). the results showed that the three l. lactis subsp. lactis strains were able to produce bacteriocins: in particular, l. lactis subsp. lactis vr84 and eg46 produced, respectively, nisin z and lacticin 481, while for the strains  cg27 the bacteriocin has not been yet identified, even if its peptidic nature has been demonstrated. the co-culture of e. faecalis ef37 in combination with lactococci significantly reduced the growth potential of this aminobiogenic strain, both in terms of growth rate and maximum cell concentration, depending on the initial inoculum level of e. faecalis. tyramine accumulation was strongly reduced when e. faecalis ef37 was inoculated at 2 log cfu/ml and, to a lesser extent, at 3 log cfu/ml, as a result of a lower cell load of the aminobiogenic strain. all the lactococci were more efficient in inhibiting streptococci in comparison with e. faecalis ef37; in particular, l. lactis subsp. lactis vr84 induced the death of s. thermophilus pri60 and allowed the detection of histamine traces only at higher streptococci inoculum levels (5-6 log cfu/ml). the other two lactococcal strains did not show a lethal action against s. thermophilus pri60, but were able to reduce its growth extent and histamine accumulation, even if l. lactis subsp. lactis eg46 was less effective when the initial streptococci  concentration was 5 and 6 log cfu/ml. this preliminary study has clarified some aspects regarding the ratio between bacteriocinogenic strains and aminobiogenic strains with respect to the possibility to accumulate ba and has also showed that different bacteriocins can have different effects on ba production on the same strain. this knowledge is essentially aimed to use bacteriocinogenic lactococci as a predictable strategy against aminobiogenic bacteria present in cheese or other fermented foods.

TI  == development of a multiplex real-time pcr assay for the rapid diagnosis of neonatal late onset sepsis.
AB  == the diagnosis of late onset sepsis (los), a severe condition with high prevalence in preterm infants, is hampered by the suboptimal sensitivity and long turnaround time of blood culture. detection of the infecting pathogen directly in blood by pcr would provide a much more timely result. unfortunately, pcr-based assays reported so far are labor intensive and often lack direct species identification. therefore we developed a real-time multiplex pcr assay tailored to los diagnosis  which is easy-to-use, is applicable on small blood volumes and provides species-specific results within 4h. species-specific pcr assays were selected from literature or developed using bioinformatic tools for the detection of the most prevalent etiologic pathogens: enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus spp., streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella spp. and serratia marcescens. the pcr assays showed 100% specificity, full coverage of the target pathogens and a limit of detection (lod) of </=10cfueq./reaction. these lod values were maintained in the multiplex format or when bacterial dna was isolated from blood. clinical evaluation showed high concordance between the multiplex pcr and blood culture. in conclusion, we developed a multiplex pcr that allows the direct detection of the most important  bacterial pathogens causing los in preterm infants.

AB  == background: the major gram-positive coccoid pathogens cause similar invasive diseases and show high rates of antimicrobial resistance. uncharacterised proteins shared by these organisms may be involved in virulence or be targets for antimicrobial therapy. results: forty four uncharacterised proteins from streptococcus pneumoniae with homologues in enterococcus faecalis and/or staphylococcus aureus were selected for analysis. these proteins showed differences in terms of sequence conservation and number of interacting partners. twenty eight of these proteins were monodomain proteins and 16 were modular, involving domain combinations and, in many cases, predicted unstructured regions. the genes coding for four of these 44 proteins were essential. genomic and structural studies showed one of the four essential genes to code for a promising antibacterial target. the strongest impact of gene removal was on monodomain proteins showing high sequence conservation and/or interactions with many other proteins. eleven out of 40 knockouts (one for each gene) showed growth delay and  10 knockouts presented a chaining phenotype. five of these chaining mutants showed a lack of putative dna-binding proteins. this suggest this phenotype results from a loss of overall transcription regulation. five knockouts showed defective autolysis in response to penicillin and vancomycin, and attenuated virulence in an animal model of sepsis. conclusions: uncharacterised proteins make up a reservoir of polypeptides of different physiological importance and biomedical potential. a promising antibacterial target was identified. five of the 44 examined proteins seemed to be virulence factors.

TI  == microbial community in persistent apical periodontitis: a 16s rrna gene clone library analysis.
AB  == aim: to characterize the microbial composition of persistent periapical lesions of root filled teeth using a molecular genetics approach. methodology: apical lesion samples were collected from 12 patients (23-80 years old) who visited the  kyushu university hospital for apicectomy with persistent periapical lesions associated with root filled teeth. dna was directly extracted from each sample and the microbial composition was comprehensively analysed using clone library analysis of the 16s rrna gene. enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans and specific fima genotypes of porphyromonas gingivalis were confirmed using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) analysis with specific primers. results: bacteria were detected in all samples, and the dominant findings were p. gingivalis (19.9%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.2%) and propionibacterium acnes (9%). bacterial diversity was greater in symptomatic lesions than in asymptomatic ones. in addition, the following bacteria or bacterial combinations were characteristic to symptomatic lesions: prevotella spp., treponema spp., peptostreptococcaceae sp. hot-113, olsenella uli, slackia exigua, selemonas infelix, p. gingivalis with type iv fima, and a combination of p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and peptostreptococcaceae sp. hot-113 and predominance of streptococcus spp. on the other hand, neither enterococcus faecalis nor c. albicans were detected in any of the samples. conclusion: whilst a diverse bacterial species were observed in the  persistent apical lesions, some characteristic patterns of bacterial community were found in the symptomatic lesions. the diverse variation of community indicates that bacterial combinations as a community may cause persistent inflammation in periapical tissues rather than specific bacterial species.

TI  == vang element insertions within a conserved chromosomal site conferring vancomycin resistance to streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus anginosus.
AB  == three vancomycin-resistant streptococcal strains carrying vang elements (two invasive streptococcus agalactiae isolates [gbs-ny and gbs-nm, both serotype ii and multilocus sequence type 22] and one streptococcus anginosus [sa]) were examined. the 45,585-bp elements found within sa and gbs-ny were nearly identical (together designated vang-1) and shared near-identity over an ~15-kb overlap with a previously described vang element from enterococcus faecalis. unexpectedly, vang-1 shared much less homology with the 49,321-bp vang-2 element from gbs-nm, with widely different levels (50% to 99%) of sequence identity shared among 44 related open reading frames. immediately adjacent to both vang-1 and vang-2 were  44,670-bp and 44,680-bp integrative conjugative element (ice)-like sequences, designated ice-r, that were nearly identical in the two group b streptococcal (gbs) strains. the dual vang and ice-r elements from both gbs strains were inserted at the same position, between bases 1328 and 1329, within the identical  rna methyltransferase (ruma) genes. a genbank search revealed that although most  gbs strains contained insertions within this specific site, only sequence type 22 (st22) gbs strains contained highly related ice-r derivatives. the vang-1 element in sa was also inserted within this position corresponding to its ruma homolog adjacent to an ice-r derivative. vang-1 insertions were previously reported within the same relative position in the e. faecalis ruma homolog. an ice-r sequence perfectly conserved with respect to its counterpart in gbs-ny was apparent within the same site of the ruma homolog of a streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis strain. additionally, homologous vang-like elements within the conserved ruma target site were evident in roseburia intestinalis. importance: these three streptococcal strains represent the first known vancomycin-resistant  strains of their species. the collective observations made from these strains reveal a specific hot spot for insertional elements that is conserved between streptococci and different gram-positive species. the two gbs strains potentially represent a gbs lineage that is predisposed to insertion of vang elements.

TI  == using color histograms and spa-lda to classify bacteria.
AB  == in this work, a new approach is proposed to verify the differentiating characteristics of five bacteria (escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus oralis, and staphylococcus aureus) by using digital images obtained with a simple webcam and variable selection by the  successive projections algorithm associated with linear discriminant analysis (spa-lda). in this sense, color histograms in the red-green-blue (rgb), hue-saturation-value (hsv), and grayscale channels and their combinations were used as input data, and statistically evaluated by using different multivariate classifiers (soft independent modeling by class analogy (simca), principal component analysis-linear discriminant analysis (pca-lda), partial least squares  discriminant analysis (pls-da) and successive projections algorithm-linear discriminant analysis (spa-lda)). the bacteria strains were cultivated in a nutritive blood agar base layer for 24 h by following the brazilian pharmacopoeia, maintaining the status of cell growth and the nature of nutrient solutions under the same conditions. the best result in classification was obtained by using rgb and spa-lda, which reached 94 and 100 % of classification accuracy in the training and test sets, respectively. this result is extremely positive from the viewpoint of routine clinical analyses, because it avoids bacterial identification based on phenotypic identification of the causative organism using gram staining, culture, and biochemical proofs. therefore, the proposed method presents inherent advantages, promoting a simpler, faster, and low-cost alternative for bacterial identification.

TI  == revised reference broth microdilution method for testing telavancin: effect on mic results and correlation with other testing methodologies.
AB  == the reference broth microdilution (bmd) antimicrobial susceptibility testing method for telavancin was revised to include dimethyl sulfoxide (dmso) as a solvent and diluent for frozen-form panel preparation, following the clsi recommendations for water-insoluble agents. polysorbate 80 (p-80) was also added  to the test medium to minimize proven drug losses associated with binding to plastic surfaces. four hundred sixty-two gram-positive isolates, including a challenge set of organisms with reduced susceptibilities to comparator agents, were selected and tested using the revised method for telavancin, and the mic results were compared with those tested by the previously established method and  several sensititre dry-form bmd panel formulations. the revised method provided mic results 2- to 8-fold lower than the previous method when tested against staphylococci and enterococci, resulting in mic50 values of 0.03 to 0.06 mug/ml for staphylococci and 0.03 and 0.12 mug/ml for enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis, respectively. less-significant mic decreases (1 to 2 log2  dilution steps) were observed when testing streptococci in broth supplemented with blood, which showed similar mic50 values for both methods. however, streptococcus pneumoniae had mic50 results of 0.008 and 0.03 mug/ml when tested by the revised and previous methods, respectively. highest essential agreement rates (>/=94.0%) were noted for one candidate dry-form panel formulation compared to the revised test. the revised bmd method provides lower mic results for telavancin, especially when tested against staphylococci and enterococci. this is secondary to the use of dmso for panel production and the presence of p-80, which ensure the proper telavancin testing concentration and result in a more accurate  mic determination. moreover, earlier studies where the previous method was applied underestimated the in vitro drug potency.

TI  == susceptibility of methacrylate-based root canal filling to degradation by bacteria found in endodontic infections.
AB  == objectives: to present a case of endodontic failure obturated with a methacrylate-based root filling material, resilon/realseal (rs). to determine if  rs is susceptible to biodegradation by endodontically relevant microbes by a method known to show rs degradation. method and materials: emulsions of rs were dispersed in agar with minimal bacterial nutrients in culture plates. lipase ps served as a positive control. pseudomonas aeruginosa, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis were tested for their ability to biodegrade rs. the bacteria were inoculated in the plates and examined daily for rs degradation for 7 days. results: degradation of the emulsified rs manifested in the formation of clear zones around p aeruginosa, p intermedia, p asaccharolytica, s aureus, and s epidermidis. no degradation was seen with the other tested bacteria or in plates that did not contain rs emulsion. conclusion:  endodontic pathogenic bacteria can degrade rs. these findings complement other work and suggest that the seal and integrity of root canal fillings obturated with rs may be impaired by a microbial insult.

TI  == microbial diversity in persistent root canal infections investigated by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == introduction: the aim of the present study was to investigate the composition of  the root canal microbiota in endodontic failures in order to identify and quantify these microorganisms. methods: microbiological samples were taken from 36 root canals with persistent endodontic infection. the presence, levels, and proportions of 79 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the pearson correlation coefficient was used to investigate the relations between bacterial counts and clinical conditions (p </= .05). results:  enterococcus faecium (36%), streptococcus epidermidis (36%), eubacterium saburreum (28%), parvimonas micra (28%), streptococcus sanguis (28%), capnocytophaga sputigena (28%), leptotrichia buccalis (28%), enterococcus faecalis (28%), and staphylococcus warneri (28%) were the most prevalent species; and there was a low prevalence of treponema socranskii (3%), fusobacterium periodonticum (3%), capnocytophaga gingivalis (3%), and spiroplasma ixodetis (3%). the highest mean levels were found for the following species: e. faecium, dialister pneumosintes, staphylococcus epidermidis and helicobacter pylori. there was a statistically significant difference between the levels of gram-negative species and gram-positive species (13.5 x 10(5) vs 6.5 x 10(5), respectively). a  positive correlation was found between the area of the periapical lesion and the  levels of gram-negative and rod species (p < .05). conclusions: the microbiota from teeth with persistent apical periodontitis presents a mixed and complex profile, hosting e. faecium and s. epidermidis as the most highly prevalent species. no correlation was found between any of the species tested and clinical  findings; however, periapical lesions with the largest areas presented higher counts of gram-negative and rod species.

TI  == determination of kinetics and the crystal structure of a novel type 2 isopentenyl diphosphate: dimethylallyl diphosphate isomerase from streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (idi) is a key enzyme in the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway and is required for all organisms that synthesize isoprenoid metabolites from mevalonate. type 1 idi (idi-1) is a metalloprotein that is found in eukaryotes, whereas the type 2 isoform (idi-2) is a flavoenzyme found in bacteria that is completely absent from human. idi-2 from the pathogenic bacterium streptococcus pneumoniae was recombinantly expressed in escherichia coli. steady-state kinetic studies of the enzyme indicated that fmnh2 (km =0.3 mum) bound before isopentenyl diphosphate (km =40 mum) in an ordered binding mechanism. an x-ray crystal structure at 1.4 a resolution was obtained for the holoenzyme in the closed conformation with a reduced flavin cofactor and two sulfate ions in the active site. these results helped to further approach the enzymatic mechanism of idi-2 and, thus, open new possibilities for the rational design of antibacterial compounds against sequence-similar and structure-related  pathogens such as enterococcus faecalis or staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == improving photodynamic inactivation of bacteria in dentistry: highly effective and fast killing of oral key pathogens with novel tooth-colored type-ii photosensitizers.
AB  == increasing antibiotic resistances in microorganisms create serious problems in public health. this demands alternative approaches for killing pathogens to supplement standard treatment methods. photodynamic inactivation of bacteria (pib) uses light activated photosensitizers (ps) to generate reactive oxygen species immediately upon illumination, inducing lethal phototoxicity. positively  charged phenalen-1-one derivatives are a new generation of ps for light-mediated  killing of pathogens with outstanding singlet oxygen quantum yield phidelta of >97%. upon irradiation with a standard photopolymerizer light (bluephase c8, 1260 +/- 50 mw/cm(2)) the ps showed high activity against the oral key pathogens enterococcus faecalis, actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus mutans, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. at a concentration of 10 mum, a maximum efficacy of more than 6 log10 steps (>/= 99.9999%) of bacteria killing is reached in less than 1 min (light dose 50 j/cm(2)) after one single treatment. the pyridinium substituent as positively charged moiety is especially advantageous for antimicrobial action.

TI  == development of an immunochromatographic test with anti-lipl32-coupled gold nanoparticles for leptospira detection.
AB  == detection of antibody specific to leptospira by various immunological techniques  has been used for leptospirosis diagnosis. however, the sensitivity of antibody detection during the first few days after infection is low. molecular techniques  are suggested to provide earlier diagnosis than antibody detection, but a rapid and easy to perform assay for leptospira antigen detection would provide an additional useful tool for disease diagnosis. in this study, we coupled gold nanoparticles with antibody to lipl32, a protein commonly found in pathogenic leptospira. this coupled gold reagent was used in the immunochromatographic strip for leptospira detection. we demonstrated that the sensitivity of leptospira detection by this strip was 10(3) ml(-1). there was no positive result detected when strips were tested with non-pathogenic leptospira, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus group b, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis or enterococcus faecium. these data suggest that gold nanoparticles coupled with antibody to lipl32 could  be used for leptospira detection by a rapid test based on an immunochromatographic technique.

TI  == the physiology and metabolism of enterococci
AB  == when possible, the authors have provided open reading frame (orf) numbers (ef####) from the extensively annotated e. faecalis v583 genome sequence. this information can be easily accessed at enterocyc.broadinstitute.org. if applicable, non-v583 enterococcal sequences with homology to the annotated orf have been supplied. additionally, we have included iubmb nomenclature for most reactions, which are available at http://www.iubmb.org. enterococci have been isolated and characterized for more than 113 years (maccallum & hastings, 1899).  during the past century, the classification of this genus has been refined, with  the most significant change occurring in 1984 when most members of the group d streptococci, including streptococcus faecalis and streptococcus faecium, were included in the new genus enterococcus (schleifer & kilpper-balz, 1984). this genus currently consists of 37 species that occupy a broad range of habitats that include the gastrointestinal microbiota of nearly every animal phylum (see enterococcus diversity, origins in nature, and gut colonization for details). an  ability to widely colonize is due, at least in part, to their metabolic versatility and intrinsic resistance to inhospitable conditions. despite being unable to form spores, enterococci are highly tolerant to desiccation and can persist for months on dried surfaces. enterococci also tolerate extremes of ph, ionizing radiation, osmotic and oxidative stresses, high heavy metal concentrations, and antibiotics. enterococci survive or grow over a wide range of temperatures for mesophilic bacteria, from 10 to 45 degrees c. these bacteria, as highly evolved commensals, have been extensively used in the food industry and as probiotics to prevent or ameliorate disease. finally, rogue strains of enterococci have emerged on the worldwide stage as multidrug-resistant and hospital-acquired pathogens. enterococci are often simply described as lactic-acid-producing bacteria-a designation that understates their vast metabolic potential. the ubiquitous nature of enterococci in our environment implies this potential. investigations into the remarkable physiology of these bacteria have fluctuated over the past century. prior to publication of the enterococci (huycke m. m., 2002), and now with this volume, the last formal comprehensive review of enterococcal metabolism was written in 1964 (deibel, 1964). at that time, substantial efforts by gunsalus, sokatch, gale, niven, and deibel, among others, focused on the central metabolism of enterococci. since then, research into enterococcal physiology has increasingly used the tools of molecular biology and has shifted toward understanding antibiotic resistance, pathogenesis, and genomics. with this new information, there has been increasing  recognition that many metabolic genes and pathways vary, even within single species, and led investigators to question the concept of a uniform core metabolism for enterococci. to address this perspective and update the available  information on enterococcal physiology, this chapter compiles and reviews the most recent findings from laboratories around the world, and integrates those results with the older literature. as will be evident, the rapid growth of genomic databases continues to offer valuable insights into the physiology of enterococci and greatly facilitates experimental designs into their metabolism.

TI  == characterization of aid1, a novel gene involved in fusobacterium nucleatum interspecies interactions.
AB  == the oral opportunistic pathogen fusobacterium nucleatum is known to interact with a large number of different bacterial species residing in the oral cavity. it adheres to a variety of gram-positive bacteria, including oral streptococci via the arginine-inhibitable adhesin radd. in this study, we describe a novel protein encoded by the predicted open reading frame fn1253 that appears to play a role in interspecies interactions of f. nucleatum, particularly with oral streptococci and related gram-positive species. we designated fn1253 as aid1 (adherence inducing determinant 1). expression analyses demonstrated that this gene was induced in f. nucleatum single species biofilms, while the presence of representative members of the oral microbiota known to adhere to f. nucleatum triggered its suppression. inactivation as well as overexpression of aid1 affected the ability of f. nucleatum to coaggregate with oral streptococci and the closely related enterococcus faecalis, but not other gram-positive oral species tested. furthermore, overexpression of aid1 led to a drastic change in the structure of dual species biofilms of f. nucleatum with oral streptococci. aid1 function was abolished in the presence of arginine and found to be dependent on radd. interestingly, differential expression of aid1 did not affect messenger  rna and protein levels of radd. these findings indicate that radd-mediated adhesion to oral streptococci involves more complex cellular processes than the simple interaction of adhesins on the surface of partner strains. aid1 could potentially play an important role in facilitating radd-mediated interaction with oral streptococci by increasing binding specificity of f. nucleatum to other microbial species.

TI  == impact of staphylococcus aureus on pathogenesis in polymicrobial infections.
AB  == polymicrobial infections involving staphylococcus aureus exhibit enhanced disease severity and morbidity. we reviewed the nature of polymicrobial interactions between s. aureus and other bacterial, fungal, and viral cocolonizers. microbes that were frequently recovered from the infection site with s. aureus are haemophilus influenzae, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pneumoniae, corynebacterium sp., lactobacillus sp., candida albicans, and influenza virus. detailed analyses of several in vitro and in vivo  observations demonstrate that s. aureus exhibits cooperative relations with c. albicans, e. faecalis, h. influenzae, and influenza virus and competitive relations with p. aeruginosa, streptococcus pneumoniae, lactobacillus sp., and corynebacterium sp. interactions of both types influence changes in s. aureus that alter its characteristics in terms of colony formation, protein expression,  pathogenicity, and antibiotic susceptibility.

AB  == purpose: considering the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties of green tea, this study aimed to evaluate the antibacterial effect of mouthrinses containing green tea extract vs 0.2% chlorhexidine on selected microorganisms in vitro. materials and methods: the antibacterial activity of both mouthrinses and the pure green tea extract was assessed by using disk diffusion and the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) methods against five microorganisms: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aerogenosa and escherichia coli. growth inhibition zones were measured in mm after 24 h of incubation at 37 degrees c. the two mouthrinses were assessed at concentrations of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256 and 512 mg/ml to determine the mic, which was interpreted as the lowest concentration of the agent that completely inhibited the growth of the test species. results: 0.2% chlorhexidine produced a larger zone of growth inhibition than did the mouthrinse made of green tea extract (p < 0.01). paradoxically, the growth inhibition zones  of the tested bacteria were significantly larger in pure extract of green tea than in 0.2% chlorhexidine (p < 0.01). the chlorhexidine mouthrinse inhibited the growth of all tested species and exhibited significantly lower mics than did the  green tea mouthrinse (p < 0.01). conclusions: even though the mouthrinse made with green tea extract presented an in vitro antimicrobial activity inferior to 0.2% chlorhexidine, the pure extract had considerable bactericidal effect.

TI  == photodynamic therapy versus ultrasonic irrigation: interaction with endodontic microbial biofilm, an ex vivo study.
AB  == introduction: photodynamic therapy was introduced as an adjuvant to conventional  chemo-mechanical debridement during endodontic treatment to overcome the persistence of biofilms. the aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of photodynamic therapy (pdt) to disrupt an experimental microbial biofilm inside the root canal in a clinically applicable working time. materials and methods: thirty extracted teeth were prepared and then divided in three groups. all samples were infected with an artificially formed biofilm made of enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus salivarius, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia bacteria. first group was treated with aseptim plus(r) photo-activated (led) disinfection system, second group by a 650 nm diode laser and toluidine blue as photosensitizer, and the third group, as control group, by ultrasonic irrigation (pui) using edta 17% and naocl 2.6% solutions. the working time for all three groups was fixed at 3 min. presence or absence of biofilm was assessed  by aerobic and anaerobic cultures. results: there was no statistically significant difference between results obtained from groups treated by aseptim plus(r) and diode laser (p<0.6267). in cultures of both groups there was a maximal bacterial growth. the group that was treated by ultrasonic irrigation and naocl and edta solutions had the best results (p<0.0001): there was a statistically significant reduction of bacterial load and destruction of microbial biofilm. conclusion: under the condition of this study, photodynamic therapy could not disrupt endodontic artificial microbial biofilm and could not inhibit bacterial growth in a clinically favorable working time.

TI  == a comparison between antibacterial activity of propolis and aloe vera on enterococcus faecalis (an in vitro study).
AB  == removing the bacteria, including enterococcus faecalis, from the root canal is one of the important aims in endodontic treatment.we aimed to compare the antibacterial activity of chlorhexidine with two natural drugs. the antibacterial activities of three different propolis extracts (alcohol concentrations: 0, 15, 40%) and aloe vera gel on e. faecalis were compared using three methods: disk diffusion, microdilution and direct contact test. in addition to the above bacterium, the aloe vera gel effect on staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus mutans was evaluated. disk diffusion test revealed that propolis ethanolic extracts (the alcohol concentration of 15 and 40%) and aloe vera gel have antibacterial activities but aqueous extract of propolis did not show any effect  in this test. the mics for propolis ethanolic extracts, aloe vera gel and aqueous extract of propolis (0% alcohol) were 313 microg/ml, 750 microg/ml, 2250 microg/ml, and >/= 500 microg/ml respectively, much higher than the chlorhexidine one. in direct contact test, contrary to aloe vera, all three propolis extracts showed antibacterial effects on e. faecalis. the aloe vera gel also showed significant antibacterial effect on s.aureus and s.mutans. the hydroalcoholic extracts of propolis and aloe vera gel had antibacterial effects on e. faecalis,  however, propolis is more potent than aloe vera. the antibacterial effect of aloe vera on s. aureus and s. mutans is low (mic >/= 2250 microg/ml). appropriate concentrations of alcoholic extracts of propolis and some fractions of aloe vera  gel might be good choices for disinfecting the root canal in endodontic treatments.

TI  == mechanism for transfer of transposon tn2010 carrying macrolide resistance genes in streptococcus pneumoniae and its effects on genome evolution.
AB  == objectives: the objective of this study was to identify the mechanism responsible for the horizontal transfer of transposon tn2010 in streptococcus pneumoniae, and the genomic alterations introduced by the transfer process. methods: tn2010 was identified using pcr in 15 clinical isolates of s. pneumoniae with erythromycin resistance. s. pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis isolates were used as recipient cells in mating and transformation experiments to test the conjugative  transferability and transformability of tn2010. whole-genome sequencing was used  to assess the effects of the tn2010 transfer on recipient genomes. the biological cost of the horizontal acquisition of tn2010 and additional genomic changes was investigated by growth competition experiments. results: tn2010 was transformed at a frequency of 3 x 10(-7) transformants per cfu, whereas no transconjugants were detected using s. pneumoniae or e. faecalis as recipient cells. genome analysis showed that many other recombinations were scattered throughout the genome of the transformants in addition to transposon tn2010. the transformants demonstrated a negligible fitness cost compared with the wild-type strain. conclusions: tn2010 tended to be transferred by transformation rather than conjugation in s. pneumoniae, and the spread of tn2010 could have a profound effect on the evolution of the genome. the acquisition of tn2010 with negligible  fitness cost may facilitate spread of the transposon.

TI  == gamma-alkylidene-gamma-lactones and isobutylpyrrol-2(5h)-ones analogues to rubrolides as inhibitors of biofilm formation by gram-positive and gram-negative  bacteria.
AB  == several molecules have been discovered that interfere with formation of bacterial biofilms, opening a new strategy for the development of more efficient treatments in case of antibiotic resistant bacteria. amongst the most active compounds are some natural brominated furanones from marine algae delisea pulchra that have proven to be able to control pathogenic biofilms. we have recently reported that  some rubrolide analogues are able to inhibit biofilm formation of enterococcus faecalis. in the present letter we describe results of the biological evaluation  of a small library of 28 compounds including brominated furanones and the corresponding lactams against biofilm formation of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus mutans. our  results showed that in general these compounds were more active against biofilms  of s. epidermidis and p. aeruginosa, with little or no inhibition of planktonic bacterial growth. in some cases they were able to prevent biofilm formation of p. aeruginosa at concentrations as low as 0.6 mug/ml (1.3 mum, compound 3d) and 0.7  mug/ml (1.3 mum, 3f). results also indicate that, in general, lactams are more active against biofilms than their precursors, thus designating this class of molecules as good candidates for the development of a new generation of antimicrobial drugs targeted to biofilm inhibition.

TI  == diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease (pid): intra-operative findings and comparison of vaginal and intra-abdominal cultures.
AB  == introduction: pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) is frequent in adolescents and younger women. diagnosis is usually based on the clinical findings, and the threshold for empiric antibiotic therapy should be low. however, at least in cases of resistance toward therapy or deterioration of symptoms, laparoscopic evaluation can be helpful. methods: we searched the hospital charts for in-house  patients who were treated for pid or tubo-ovarian abscess between 2007 and 2010.  in cases with both vaginal and intra-abdominal bacterial cultures, results of those were compared. results: 73 patients with suspected pid or tubo-ovarian abscess were included. median patients' age was 40 years (18-88), 18 of 73 (24.7  %) patients had an iud at the time of consultation. 58 patients underwent laparoscopy or laparotomy. in 41 patients (70.7 %) tubo-ovarian abscess could be  confirmed, four patients had differential gynecologic diagnoses, and two patients appendicitis. in vaginal swabs, most frequent bacteria were streptococcus sp. (28.5 %), escherichia coli (22.2 %), enterococcus faecalis (15.9 %), and staphylococcus sp. (9.5 %). in eight patients (11 %) chlamydia trachomatis could  be found, there was no case of neisseria gonorrhea. in 33 patients both vaginal and abdominal cultures were available. in nine cases (27.3 %), identical bacteria could be found, however, 11 cases (33.3 %) showed different results. conclusion:  in severe cases of pid, laparoscopic evaluation and taking an intra-abdominal bacterial culture are helpful for the confirmation of diagnosis, accurate microbiologic testing and specific therapy.

TI  == antibiotic resistance and capacity for biofilm formation of different bacteria isolated from endodontic infections associated with root-filled teeth.
AB  == introduction: to date, a variety of microbial species have been isolated from endodontic infections. however, endodontic clinical bacterial isolates have not been sufficiently characterized with regard to their capacity for antibiotic resistance and biofilm formation. in this study, antibiotic resistance and biofilm formation of 47 different aerobic and anaerobic bacterial isolates, belonging to 32 different species previously isolated from infected filled root canals, were studied. methods: antibiotic sensitivity to 11 antibiotics including penicillin g, amoxicillin, clindamycin, gentamicin, vancomycin, tetracycline, doxycycline, fosfomycin, rifampicin, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin was tested using the standardized etest method (bio merieux, marcy-1'etoile, france). the antibiotic sensitivity of 4 control strains was also estimated in parallel. additionally, the capacity to form biofilms was quantified using the microtiter plate test. results: different aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species were either resistant against a number of antibiotics or showed high minimal inhibitory concentrations against clinically relevant antibiotics. five aerobic and 2 anaerobic isolates, including enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus mutans,  lactobacillus fermentum, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, prevotella buccae, and propionibacterium acidifaciens, were characterized as being high biofilm producers, whereas 8 aerobic and 3 anaerobic isolates were found to be moderate biofilm producers. most isolates with resistance or markedly high minimal inhibitory concentration values were also either moderate biofilm producers or high biofilm producers. conclusions: these results suggest that the  clinical significance of endodontic infections could include that they serve as a reservoir for antibiotic resistance. furthermore, endodontic treatment should consider the adhesion and biofilm formation by a variety of bacteria.

TI  == animal rennets as sources of dairy lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the microbial composition of artisan and industrial animal rennet pastes was studied by using both culture-dependent and -independent approaches. pyrosequencing targeting the 16s rrna gene allowed to identify 361 operational taxonomic units (otus) to the genus/species level. among lactic acid bacteria (lab), streptococcus thermophilus and some lactobacilli, mainly lactobacillus crispatus and lactobacillus reuteri, were the most abundant species, with differences among the samples. twelve groups of microorganisms were targeted by viable plate counts revealing a dominance of mesophilic cocci. all rennets were able to acidify ultrahigh-temperature-processed (uht) milk as shown by ph and total titratable acidity (tta). presumptive lab isolated at the highest dilutions of acidified milks were phenotypically characterized, grouped, differentiated at  the strain level by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analysis, and subjected to 16s rrna gene sequencing. only 18 strains were clearly identified at the species level, as enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii, and streptococcus thermophilus, while the other strains, all belonging to the genus enterococcus, could not be allotted into any previously described species. the phylogenetic analysis showed that these strains might represent different unknown species. all strains were evaluated for their dairy technological performances. all isolates produced diacetyl, and 10 of them produced a rapid ph drop in milk,  but only 3 isolates were also autolytic. this work showed that animal rennet pastes can be sources of lab, mainly enterococci, that might contribute to the microbial diversity associated with dairy productions.

TI  == restriction of the conformational dynamics of the cyclic acyldepsipeptide antibiotics improves their antibacterial activity.
AB  == the cyclic acyldepsipeptide (adep) antibiotics are a new class of antibacterial agents that kill bacteria via a mechanism that is distinct from all clinically used drugs. these molecules bind and dysregulate the activity of the clpp peptidase. the potential of these antibiotics as antibacterial drugs has been enhanced by the elimination of pharmacological liabilities through medicinal chemistry efforts. here, we demonstrate that the adep conformation observed in the adep-clpp crystal structure is fortified by transannular hydrogen bonding and can be further stabilized by judicious replacement of constituent amino acids within the peptidolactone core structure with more conformationally constrained counterparts. evidence supporting constraint of the molecule into the bioactive conformer was obtained by measurements of deuterium-exchange kinetics of hydrogens that were proposed to be engaged in transannular hydrogen bonds. we show that the rigidified adep analogs bind and activate clpp at lower concentrations in vitro. remarkably, these compounds have up to 1200-fold enhanced antibacterial activity when compared to those with the peptidolactone core structure common to two adep natural products. this study compellingly demonstrates how rational modulation of conformational dynamics may be used to improve the bioactivities of natural products.

AB  == context: traditional medicinal plants have long been used in ethiopia to treat human and livestock ailments. despite a well-documented rich tradition of medicinal plant use in the country, their direct antimicrobial effects are still  poorly known. objective: to investigate the antimicrobial activity of 19 medicinal plant species that were selected based on the ethnobotanical information on their traditional use to treat infectious diseases in ankober district. methods: about 23 different ethanol extracts of plants obtained by maceration of various parts of 19 medicinal plant species were studied for potential antimicrobial activity using a broth microdilution method against bacillus cereus, bacteroides fragilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pyogenes. results: plant extracts from embelia schimperi vatke (myrsinaceae) showed the strongest antibacterial activity with a  minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) value of 64 microg/ml against b. cereus, l. monocytogenes, and s. pyogenes. growth inhibitory activities were also observed for extracts of ocimum lamiifolium hochst. (lamiaceae) against s. pyogenes, and those of rubus steudneri schweinf. (rosaceae) against s. epidermidis at an mic value of 128 microg/ml. generally, 74% of ethanol extracts  (17 extracts) showed antimicrobial activity against one or more of the microbial  strains tested at an mic value of 512 microg/ml or below. discussion and conclusions: results confirm the antimicrobial role of traditional medicinal plants of ankober and warrant further investigations on promising medicinal plant species so as to isolate and characterise chemicals responsible for the observed  strong antimicrobial activities.

TI  == prolonged delivery of ciprofloxacin and diclofenac sodium from a polymeric fibre  device for the treatment of periodontal disease.
AB  == in vitro analysis of drug release and antimicrobial activity of the coblended crosslinked polymeric fibre device (pfd) were investigated. the fibre loaded with ciprofloxacin and diclofenac sodium was comprised of alginate and glycerol crosslinked with barium cations. the ph dependent drug release was evident with ciprofloxacin and diclofenac sodium diffusing from the fibre at ph 4.0 compared to ph 6.8, where the fibre swelled and eroded resulting in zero-order drug release. agar diffusion studies followed by minimum inhibitory assays were conducted to determine the antimicrobial activity of the device against escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus mutans. the antimicrobial activity of the pfd was confirmed in both test assays against all test pathogens. the mic ranges at ph 4.0 for e. coli, e. faecalis, and s. mutans  were 0.5-0.8, 0.4-1.1, and 0.7-2.1 mug/ml, respectively. at ph 6.8, similar efficacies (0.3-0.5 mug/ml for e. coli and e. faecalis and 0.6-1.0 mug/ml for s.  mutans) were observed. the effect of varying the plasticizer and crosslinking ion concentration on drug release profile of the fibers was further elucidated and conceptualized using molecular mechanics energy relationships (mmer) and by exploring the spatial disposition of geometrically minimized molecular conformations.

TI  == antibiogram pattern of oral microflora in periodontic children of age group 6 to  12 years: a clinicomicrobiological study.
AB  == aim: the study was carried out to see the diversity of oral microflora and its antibiotic sensitivity test in children of age group 6 to 12 years was carried. materials and methods: total 50 patients of age group 6 to 12 years were analyzed for their oral microflora and then checked for the antibiotic susceptibility test. the samples that were collected were incubated at 37 degrees c for 48 hours. once dispersed samples were taken and gram staining was done, also they were spread on to a number of freshly prepared agar plates and incubated to allow cells to form microbial colony. results: the result showed microflora common in all types, gram-positive facultative anaerobic rods and cocci. in normal children gram-positive facultative anaerobic and fermenting cocci were predominant where as in children with caries growth of microbiota that were gram-negative and positive, capnophilic, motile and anaerobic rods and cocci belonging to members of genera s. mutans and a. actinomycetemcomitans was seen. conclusion: by the present study it has been concluded that the number of bacteria determined by microscopic counts was twice as high in caries patients as in healthy sites, and  also recommended that amoxicillin, ampicillin and amikacin are the most effective antibacterial drugs for the treatment of dental caries.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection  treatment with photolysis of hydrogen peroxide.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection treatment with photolysis of h2o2 and comparing this with existing antibacterial agents. we tested seven antibacterial agents, including amoxicillin, cefepime hydrochloride, erythromycin, ofloxacin, clindamycin hydrochloride, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, and minocycline hydrochloride, as positive controls for validation of the assay protocol. for all of the agents tested, at least one of the four bacterial species (staphylococcus  aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and streptococcus salivarius) was resistant to these agents by repeated exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of the agents up to 10 times. in contrast, antibacterial activity  against any of the bacterial species tested (s. aureus, e. faecalis, e. coli, s.  salivarius, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus mutans, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) was not affected by repeated exposure to the disinfection  treatment up to 40 times. this finding suggested that the risk of inducing bacterial resistance by disinfection treatment was low. the active ingredient of  this disinfection treatment is hydroxyl radicals generated by photolysis of h2o2. therefore, hydroxyl radicals interact with several cell structures and different  metabolic pathways in microbial cells, probably resulting in a lack of development of bacterial resistance. in conclusion, disinfection treatment with photolysis of h2o2 appears to be a potential alternative for existing antimicrobial agents in terms of a low risk of inducing bacterial resistance.

TI  == friends group: clinical and microbiological characteristics of post-filtering surgery endophthalmitis.
AB  == purpose: to study the clinical and microbiological characteristics as well as the prognostic factors for post-filtering surgery endophthalmitis. methods: twenty-three eyes were included in the study in four tertiary centres between 2004 and 2010. the clinical and microbiological data were collected prospectively (minimum follow-up, 6 months). microbiological diagnosis was based on conventional cultures and panbacterial pcr (16srdna amplification and sequencing). results: the onset of endophthalmitis was early (<6 weeks) in 22 % of the cases and delayed in 78 %. elevated intraocular pressure and hypopyon were more frequent in delayed than in early presentations (p = 0.04). by combining the results of culture and panbacterial pcr, a bacterial species could be identified  in 73.9 % of the cases, including 56.5 % of commensal species of the digestive tract such as moraxella spp., oropharyngeal streptococci and enterococcus faecalis. good final visual acuity (va >/= 20/40) was correlated with initial va  greater than light perception (p = 0.05). poor final va (</=20/400) was correlated with a higher virulence of the infecting bacterial species (p = 0.006), and was noted in all patients with early-onset endophthalmitis. conclusion: acute early- or delayed-onset post-filtering surgery endophthalmitis  is frequently caused by bacteria of the digestive tract (e.g., streptococcus and  enterococcus spp.). the combination of conventional cultures and panbacterial pcr allowed us to identify the causative microorganism in three-quarters of the cases, i.e., 21 % more cases than through culture alone. despite adequate antibiotic and surgical treatment, the anatomical and visual prognosis remains poor.

TI  == the effectiveness of enzymic irrigation in removing a nutrient-stressed endodontic multispecies biofilm.
AB  == aim: to establish a nutrient-stressed multispecies model biofilm and investigate  the dynamics of biofilm killing and disruption by 1% trypsin and 1% proteinase k  with or without ultrasonic activation. methodology: nutrient-stressed biofilms (propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus epidermidis, actinomyces radicidentis, streptococcus mitis and enterococcus faecalis omgs 3202) were grown on hydroxyapatite discs and in prepared root canals of single-rooted teeth in modified fluid universal medium. the treatment groups included trypsin, proteinase k, 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate and 1% sodium hypochlorite (naocl) (with and without ultrasonics). naocl and chlorhexidine were the positive controls and untreated group, and sterile saline was the negative control. the biofilms were investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) with live/dead staining and quantitative microbial culture. results: nutrient stress in the multispecies biofilm was apparent as the medium ph became alkaline, glucose was absent, and serum proteins were degraded in the supernatant. the clsm showed the percentage reduction in viable bacteria at the biofilm surface level due to nutrient starvation. on the disc model, trypsin and proteinase k were effective in killing bacteria; their aerobic viable counts were significantly lower (p < 0.01) than the negative control and chlorhexidine. naocl was the most  effective agent (p < 0.001). in the tooth model, when compared to saline, trypsin with ultrasonics caused significant killing both aerobically and anaerobically (p < 0.05). chlorhexidine (1.46 +/- 0.42), trypsin (3.56 +/- 1.18) and proteinase k  (4.2 +/- 1.01) with ultrasonics were significantly effective (p < 0.05) in reducing the substratum coverage as compared to saline with ultrasonics (12% +/-  4.9). conclusion: trypsin with ultrasonic activation has a biofilm killing and disrupting potential.

TI  == antibacterial efficacy of a human beta-defensin-3 peptide on multispecies biofilms.
AB  == introduction: the aggregation of mixed bacterial flora into sessile biofilms on root canal surfaces can be one of the causes of persistent apical periodontitis.  the aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of human beta-defensin-3 (hbd3) peptide on multispecies biofilms by using confocal laser scanning microscopy. methods: actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus salivarius, streptococcus mutans, and enterococcus faecalis were cultured in a peptone-yeast-glucose broth, and their culture suspensions were combined in equal proportions. the mixed bacteria were inoculated on sterile coverslips placed into the wells of tissue culture plates to permit the formation of mixed species biofilm. after incubation for 3 weeks, the samples were treated for 24 hours with saline (control), saturated calcium hydroxide solution (ch), 2% chlorhexidine solution (chx), and 50 mug/ml hbd3 solution. a commercial biofilm/viability assay kit was used to assess cell viability and analyze the 3-dimensional architecture  of biofilms. the percentage of dead cells was determined from the ratio of biovolumes for the red subpopulation and the total biofilm. results: three medication groups showed a significant reduction of biovolume within the biofilms compared with the control group (p < .001). the hbd3-treated biofilms had a higher percentage of dead cells than the other medication groups (p < .05). the ch and chx groups showed higher levels of bactericidal activity than saline (p <  .05), and there was no significant difference between the 2 groups (p > .05). conclusions: hbd3 peptide exhibited more antibacterial activity against mature multispecies biofilms in vitro than either ch or chx.

TI  == lipoteichoic acid of streptococcus mutans interacts with toll-like receptor 2 through the lipid moiety for induction of inflammatory mediators in murine macrophages.
AB  == streptococcus mutans is a pathogenic gram-positive bacterium that is closely associated with dental caries and subsequent pulpal inflammation. although lipoteichoic acid (lta) is considered a major virulence factor of gram-positive bacteria, little is known about the innate immunity to s. mutans lta. in this study, we purified lta from s. mutans (sm.lta) through n-butanol extraction, hydrophobic interaction column chromatography, and ion-exchange column chromatography to investigate its immunological properties using murine macrophages. the sm.lta preparation had no detectable contamination with endotoxins, proteins, or nucleic acids. upon exposure to sm.lta, the murine macrophage cell-line raw 264.7 cells produced tnf-alpha and nitric oxide (no) in  a dose-dependent manner. sm.lta preferentially bound to and activated cho/cd14/tlr2 cells rather than cho/cd14/tlr4 cells, which are stable transfectants expressing cd14 and tlr2 or cd14 and tlr4, respectively. sm.lta could not induce tnf-alpha or no production in macrophages derived from tlr2-deficient mice whereas it dose-dependently induced those inflammatory mediators in wild-type macrophages. tlr2-dependent induction of no by sm.lta was  also confirmed in raw 264.7 cells using specific antibodies blocking tlr2. furthermore, sm.lta deacylated by alkaline hydrolysis neither stimulated tlr2 nor induced tnf-alpha or no production, suggesting that sm.lta lipid moieties are crucial for the immuno-stimulatory activity of sm.lta. unlike staphylococcus aureus lta, which has potent immuno-stimulating activity, sm.lta showed a modest  induction of no production comparable to ltas of other oral bacteria enterococcus faecalis and lactobacillus plantarum. in conclusion, our results suggest that the sm.lta interacts with tlr2 through the lipid moiety for the induction of inflammatory mediators in macrophages.

TI  == icesluvan, a 94-kilobase mosaic integrative conjugative element conferring interspecies transfer of vanb-type glycopeptide resistance, a novel bacitracin resistance locus, and a toxin-antitoxin stabilization system.
AB  == a 94-kb integrative conjugative element (icesluvan) transferable to enterococcus  faecium and enterococcus faecalis from an animal isolate of streptococcus lutetiensis consists of a mosaic of genetic fragments from different gram-positive bacteria. a variant of icesluvan was confirmed in s. lutetiensis from a patient. a complete tn5382/tn1549 with a vanb2 operon is integrated into a streptococcal icesde3396-like region harboring a putative bacteriophage exclusion system, a putative agglutinin receptor precursor, and key components of a type iv secretion system. moreover, icesluvan encodes a putative mobc family mobilization protein and a relaxase and, thus, in total has all genetic components essential for conjugative transfer. a 9-kb element within tn5382/tn1549 encodes, among others, putative proteins similar to the tnpx site-specific recombinase in faecalibacterium and vanz in paenibacillus, which may contribute to the detected  low-level teicoplanin resistance. furthermore, icesluvan encodes a novel bacitracin resistance locus that is associated with reduced susceptibility to bacitracin when transferred to e. faecium. the expression of a streptococcal pezat toxin-antitoxin-encoding operon of icesluvan in s. lutetiensis, e. faecium, and e. faecalis was confirmed by reverse transcription (rt)-pcr, indicating an active toxin-antitoxin system which may contribute to stabilizing icesluvan within new hosts. junction pcr and dna sequencing confirmed that icesluvan excised to form a circular intermediate in s. lutetiensis, e. faecalis, and e. faecium. transfer between e. faecalis cells was observed in the presence of helper plasmid pip964. sequence analysis of the original s. lutetiensis donor and enterococcal transconjugants showed that icesluvan integrates in a site-specific  manner into the c-terminal end of the chromosomal trna methyltransferase gene ruma.

AB  == an oleate-dependent enterococcus faecalis isolate representing small-colony variants (scvs) was isolated from the umbilical exudate of a 31-month-old japanese male patient in nagano children's hospital, azumino, japan. the patient  had been suffering from recurrent omphalitis since early infancy. the initial e.  faecalis scv isolate formed small colonies on sheep blood agar plates and tiny colonies on chocolate and modified drigalski agar, although no visible growth was observed in hk-semi solid medium after 48 h incubation in ambient air. moreover,  the scv isolate, the colonial morphology of which was reminiscent of streptococcus species, could not be identified using the microscan walkaway-40 and api 20 strep systems, both of which yielded profile numbers that did not correspond to any bacterial species, probably as a result of insufficient growth  of the isolate. the scv isolate was subsequently identified as e. faecalis based  on its morphological, cultural and biochemical properties, and this was confirmed by sequencing the 16s rrna gene of the organism. investigations revealed that the addition of oleate, an unsaturated fatty acid, enabled the isolate to grow on every medium with normal-sized colony morphology. although it has long been known that long-chain fatty acids, especially unsaturated oleic acid, have a major inhibitory effect on the growth of a variety of microorganisms, including not only mycobacteria but also streptococci, this is, to the best of our knowledge, the first clinical isolation of an oleate-dependent e. faecalis scv isolate. in addition, oleic acid might be considered to affect the cell membrane permeability of carbohydrates or antimicrobial agents such as beta-lactams.

AB  == background: streptococcus mutans, candida albicans, and enterococcus faecalis are the three oral microorganisms most commonly implicated in the causation of oral infections. all these oral microorganisms have shown resistant to routinely used  antimicrobials. there is a need for an antimicrobial agent which is effective, safe, and economical. zingiber officinale, commonly known as ginger is one such plant product which has been used from ancient time. it has been shown to possess promising inhibitory effect on many of the oral microorganisms. on review of dental literature, there was scarcity of studies which had tried to assess antimicrobial potential of ginger extract against s. mutans, e. faecalis, and c.  albicans; hence, the present study was designed. aim: to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial potential of 10% ginger extract against s. mutans, e. faecalis, and c. albicans. settings and design: laboratory setting and experimental design. materials and methods: in the first part of the study, 10% ethanolic ginger extract was prepared in the laboratory of pharmacy college. it was then subjected to microbiological assay to determine its zone of inhibition using agar disk diffusion test and minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) using serial broth dilution method against s. mutans, c. albicans, and e. faecalis. results: 10% ethanolic ginger extract showed: (a) maximum zone of inhibition of 8 mm, 14 mm, and 11 mm against s. mutans, c. albicans, and e. faecalis respectively. (b) mic of 1.25%, 2.5%, and 2.5% against s. mutans, c. albicans, and e. faecalis respectively. conclusion: 10% ethanolic ginger extract was found to possess antimicrobial potential against all the three pathogens used in the study.

TI  == utilization of major fucosylated and sialylated human milk oligosaccharides by isolated human gut microbes.
AB  == human milk oligosaccharides (hmos) are not digested in the proximal intestine. in distal intestine, hmos collectively modify the microbiota, but the response of individual bacteria to individual components of the hmos is not well defined. here, each of 25 major isolates of the human intestinal microbiota was fed individual major fucosylated and sialylated hmos in anaerobic culture. this allowed for an assessment of the influence of specific hmos on the growth and metabolic products of individual microbiota bacteria. most bifidobacteria spp. and bacteroides spp. grew, induced alpha-l-fucosidase activity, and produced abundant lactate or short-chain fatty acids (scfas) when fed 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-fl), 3-fl, and lactodifucotetraose (ldft). lactobacillus delbrueckii atcc7830, enterococcus faecalis atcc19433, and streptococcus thermophilus atcc19258 exhibited slight growth, ph reduction, and lactate production when supplemented with 2'-fl or 3-fl, but not ldft. supplementation with 3'-sialyllactose (3'-sl) and 6'-sl promoted moderate growth of bifidobacterium longum jcm7007, 7009, 7010, 7011, 1272, 11347, atcc15708, bacteroides vulgatus atcc8482, and b. thetaiotaomicron atcc29148; accordingly, these bacteria exhibited greater neuraminidase activity and produced copious lactate, scfa, or both. lactobacillus delbrueckii atcc7830 also consumed 6'-sl. in contrast, clostridium spp., l. rhamnosus atcc53103, e. faecalis atcc29200, staphylococcus spp., enterobacter spp., and escherichia coli k12 did not consume milk oligosaccharides nor produce appreciable acidic fermentation products. specific bifidobacteria and bacteroides differentially digest specific individual hmos, with the major fucosylated milk oligosaccharides most strongly stimulating key species of mutualist symbionts. this suggests strategies for treating dysbiosis of the microbiota and associated inflammatory disorders.

TI  == synthesis and characterization of novel organocobaloximes as potential catecholase and antimicrobial activity agents.
AB  == an asymmetric, potentially bidentate dioxime ligand (h(2)l) was formed by condensation of 4-biphenylchloroglyoxime and napthyl-1-amine. two equivalents of  h(2)l were reacted with cocl(2) . 6h(2)o under appropriate conditions with deprotonation of the dioxime ligand. a series of new organocobaloxime derivatives of the type [cor(hl)(2)py], [corl(2)pyb(2)f(4)], and [corl(2)py(cu(phen))(2)] (h(2)l = 4-(napthyl-1-amino)biphenylglyoxime; phen = 1,10-phenathroline; r = izopropyl and benzyl; py = pyridine) were synthesized. the products were characterized by elemental analysis, molar conductance, ft-ir, (1)h nmr, and magnetic susceptibility measurements. catecholase-like activity properties of all complexes were also studied. all complexes are catalysts for the oxidation of 3,5-di-tert-butylcatechol to 3,5-di-tert-butyl-1,2-benzoquinone in methanol. antimicrobial activity studies of h(2)l and the six complexes were carried out on standard strains (human pathogenic) of bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus subtilis, escherichia  coli, pseudominas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi) and the yeast candida albicans. the compounds showed a significant inhibition of the growth of the gram-positive  bacteria tested. among the tested microorganisms, s. aureus was the most sensitive strain, especially to h(2)l and its complexes.

TI  == functional diversity of tandem substrate-binding domains in abc transporters from pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == the atp-binding cassette (abc) transporter glnpq is an essential uptake system for amino acids in gram-positive pathogens and related nonpathogenic bacteria. the transporter has tandem substrate-binding domains (sbds) fused to each transmembrane domain, giving rise to four sbds per functional transporter complex. we have determined the crystal structures and ligand-binding properties  of the sbds of glnpq from enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and lactococcus lactis. the tandem sbds differ in substrate specificity and affinity, allowing cells to efficiently accumulate different amino acids via a single abc transporter. the combined structural, functional, and thermodynamic analysis revealed the roles of individual residues in determining the substrate affinity.  we succeeded in converting a low-affinity sbd into a high-affinity receptor and vice versa. our data indicate that a small number of residues that reside in the  binding pocket constitute the major affinity determinants of the sbds.

TI  == evaluation of lactic acid bacteria and yeast diversity in traditional white pickled and fresh soft cheeses from the mountain regions of serbia and lowland regions of croatia.
AB  == the goal of this study was the characterisation of indigenous lactic acid bacteria (lab) and yeasts isolated from nine white pickled (bg) and nine fresh soft (zg) artisanal cheeses collected in serbia and croatia. while lab were present in all of the cheeses collected, yeasts were found in all bg cheeses but  only in three zg cheese samples. high lab and yeast species diversity was determined (average h'(l)=0.4 and h'(y)=0.8, respectively). the predominant lab species in white pickled (bg) cheeses were lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus plantarum, and leuconostoc mesenteroides, while in fresh soft (zg) cheeses the most dominant lab species were l. lactis, enterococcus faecalis, and leuconostoc  pseudomesenteroides. among the 20 yeast species found, debaryomyces hansenii, candida zeylanoides, and torulaspora delbrueckii were found to be predominant in  bg cheeses, while yarrowia lipolytica was predominant in zg cheeses. the characterisation of metabolic and technological potentials revealed that 53.4% of lab isolates produced antimicrobial compounds, 44.3% of lab strains showed proteolytic activity, while most of the yeast species possessed either lipolytic  or proteolytic activity. in conclusion, the results obtained in this study showed that the composition of lab and yeast populations in white pickled and fresh soft cheeses is region specific. the knowledge gained in this study could eventually be used to select region specific lab and yeast strains for the production of white pickled and fresh soft artisanal cheeses with geographically specific origins under controlled conditions.

TI  == tunel analysis of dna fragmentation in mouse unfertilized oocytes: the effect of  microorganisms within human follicular fluid collected during ivf cycles.
AB  == recently we reported the presence of bacteria within follicular fluid. previous studies have reported that dna fragmentation in human spermatozoa after in vivo or in vitro incubation with bacteria results in early embryo demise and a reduced rate of ongoing pregnancy, but the effect of bacteria on oocytes is unknown. this study examined the dna within mouse oocytes after 12 hours' incubation within human follicular fluids (n=5), which were collected from women undergoing in vitro fertilization (ivf) treatment. each follicular fluid sample was cultured to detect the presence of bacteria. terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dutp nick-end labeling (tunel) was used to label dna fragmentation in ovulated, non-fertilized mouse oocytes following in vitro incubation in human follicular fluid. the bacteria streptococcus anginosus and peptoniphilus spp., lactobacillus gasseri (low-dose), l. gasseri (high-dose), enterococcus faecalis, or propionibacterium acnes were detected within the follicular fluids. the most severe dna fragmentation was observed in oocytes incubated in the follicular fluids containing p. acnes or l. gasseri (high-dose). no dna fragmentation was observed in the mouse oocytes incubated in the follicular fluid containing low-dose l. gasseri or e. faecalis. low human oocyte fertilization rates (<29%) were associated with extensive fragmentation in mouse oocytes (80-100%). bacteria colonizing human follicular fluid in vivo may cause dna fragmentation in mouse oocytes following 12h of in vitro incubation. follicular fluid bacteria may result in poor quality oocytes and/or embryos, leading to poor ivf outcomes.

TI  == [comparison of in vitro antimicrobial activities of bioaggregate and mineral trioxide aggregate].
AB  == treatment outcome of endodontic perforations depends on successful elimination of the associated microorganisms and infected tissues as well as the effective seal  of the root-end or perforation site to prevent future contamination. ideally, perforation repair material has to be bacteriostatic or bactericidal in order to  prevent bacterial contamination as well as good sealing properties and biocompatibility. the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effects of bioaggregate (ba) and mineral trioxide aggregate (mta) on the standard strains of candida albicans, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis and pseudomonas aeruginosa using the agar disc diffusion test. colonies of each strains were harvested from the medium and microorganisms were diluted to obtain a suspension of approximately 108 cfu/ml. petri plates with blood agar base with 5% sheep blood or sabouraud dextrose agar  (for c.albicans) were inoculated with experimental suspensions and ba and mta discs prepared as 2 mm length and 6 mm diameter were placed. after 24 and 48 hours incubation, the diameters of the zones of inhibition were measured. the results of the disc diffusion tests showed that ba and mta were effective on the  tested microorganisms at 24 and 48 hours incubation periods. ba and mta showed similar antimicrobial effects on c.albicans and e.coli. ba was more effective than mta on s.mutans, e.faecalis and p.aeruginosa, however mta was more effective than ba on s.sanguinis at 48 hours. when the time efficiency of the materials were compared, there was no statistically difference between 24 to 48 hours on e.coli, e.faecalis, s.mutans, s.sanguinis in both two groups (p> 0.05). there was statistically significant decrease 24 to 48 hours on c.albicans in ba and mta groups and p.aeruginosa in ba group (p< 0.05). it can be concluded that although  ba and mta displayed similar antimicrobial efficacy on the tested microorganisms  newly improved material ba demonstrated superior antimicrobial activity than other.

TI  == rapid detection of gram-positive organisms by use of the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test and the bact/alert pediatric fan system in a multicenter pediatric evaluation.
AB  == assays that expedite the reporting of organism identification and antibiotic susceptibility status in positive blood cultures can fast track interventions that improve clinical outcomes. we evaluated the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test (bc-gp) in two pediatric hospitals. positive bact/alert pediatric fan blood cultures with gram-positive organisms were tested using the bc-gp in tandem with routine laboratory procedures. to test organisms underrepresented in the clinical blood culture evaluation, blood culture bottles  were spiked with diluted organism suspensions at concentrations of 10 to 100 cfu  per milliliter. a total of 249 gram-positive bacterial isolates were recovered from 242 blood cultures. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, and methicillin-resistant s. aureus with sensitivities of 100%, 99%, and 100% and specificities of 100%, 100%, and 99.5%,  respectively. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible s. epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis  with sensitivities of 95%, 80%, and 96%, respectively, and 100% specificity. the  bc-gp correctly identified 14/15 cases of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus  faecium bacteremia and 9 cases of streptococcus pneumoniae. it misidentified 5/15 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis and 1/3 blood cultures spiked with streptococcus anginosus group as s. pneumoniae. the bc-gp detected a case of streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia but failed to detect 2/3 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus agalactiae. bc-gp's rapid accurate detection of staphylococcus spp., e. faecium, and e. faecalis and its ability to  ascertain meca, vana, and vanb status may expedite clinical decisions pertaining  to optimal antibiotic use. false-positive s. pneumoniae results may warrant reporting of only "streptococcus spp." when this organism is reported by the bc-gp.

TI  == organism-adapted specificity of the allosteric regulation of pyruvate kinase in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == pyruvate kinase (pyk) is a critical allosterically regulated enzyme that links glycolysis, the primary energy metabolism, to cellular metabolism. lactic acid bacteria rely almost exclusively on glycolysis for their energy production under  anaerobic conditions, which reinforces the key role of pyk in their metabolism. these organisms are closely related, but have adapted to a huge variety of native environments. they include food-fermenting organisms, important symbionts in the  human gut, and antibiotic-resistant pathogens. in contrast to the rather conserved inhibition of pyk by inorganic phosphate, the activation of pyk shows high variability in the type of activating compound between different lactic acid bacteria. system-wide comparative studies of the metabolism of lactic acid bacteria are required to understand the reasons for the diversity of these closely related microorganisms. these require knowledge of the identities of the  enzyme modifiers. here, we predict potential allosteric activators of pyks from three lactic acid bacteria which are adapted to different native environments. we used protein structure-based molecular modeling and enzyme kinetic modeling to predict and validate potential activators of pyk. specifically, we compared the electrostatic potential and the binding of phosphate moieties at the allosteric binding sites, and predicted potential allosteric activators by docking. we then  made a kinetic model of lactococcus lactis pyk to relate the activator predictions to the intracellular sugar-phosphate conditions in lactic acid bacteria. this strategy enabled us to predict fructose 1,6-bisphosphate as the sole activator of the enterococcus faecalis pyk, and to predict that the pyks from streptococcus pyogenes and lactobacillus plantarum show weaker specificity for their allosteric activators, while still having fructose 1,6-bisphosphate play the main activator role in vivo. these differences in the specificity of allosteric activation may reflect adaptation to different environments with different concentrations of activating compounds. the combined computational approach employed can readily be applied to other enzymes.

TI  == direction of aminoacylated transfer rnas into antibiotic synthesis and peptidoglycan-mediated antibiotic resistance.
AB  == prokaryotic aminoacylated-transfer rnas often need to be efficiently segregated between translation and other cellular biosynthetic pathways. many clinically relevant bacteria, including streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa direct some aminoacylated-trna species into peptidoglycan biosynthesis and/or membrane phospholipid modification. subsequent indirect peptidoglycan cross-linkage or change in membrane permeability is often a prerequisite for high-level antibiotic resistance. in streptomycetes, aminoacylated-trna species are used for antibiotic synthesis as well as antibiotic resistance. the direction of coding aminoacylated-trna molecules away from translation and into antibiotic resistance and synthesis pathways are discussed in this review.

TI  == kinetic characterization of arginine deiminase and carbamate kinase from streptococcus pyogenes m49.
AB  == streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus, gas) is an important human pathogen causing mild superficial infections of skin and mucous membranes, but also life-threatening systemic diseases. s. pyogenes and other prokaryotic organisms use the arginine deiminase system (ads) for survival in acidic environments. in this study, the arginine deiminase (ad), and carbamate kinase (ck) from s. pyogenes m49 strain 591 were heterologously expressed in escherichia coli dh5alpha, purified, and kinetically characterized. ad and ck from s. pyogenes m49 share high amino acid sequence similarity with the respective enzymes from lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis il1403 (45.6% and 53.5% identical amino acids) and enterococcus faecalis v583 (66.8% and 66.8% identical amino acids). we found that the arginine deiminase of s. pyogenes is not allosterically regulated by the intermediates and products of the arginine degradation (e.g., atp, citrulline, carbamoyl phosphate). the km and vmax values for arginine were 1.13+/-0.12mm (mean+/-sd) and 1.51+/-0.07mumol/min/mg protein. the carbamate kinase is inhibited by atp but unaffected by arginine and citrulline. the km and  vmax values for adp were 0.72+/-0.08mm and 1.10+/-0.10mumol/min/mg protein and the km for carbamoyl phosphate was 0.65+/-0.07mm. the optimum ph and temperature  for both enzymes were 6.5 and 37 degrees c, respectively.

TI  == association of bacteria with marine invertebrates: implications for ballast water management.
AB  == bacteria associated with plankton are of importance in marine bioinvasions and the implementation of ship's ballast water treatment technologies. in this study, epibiotic and endobiotic bacteria associated with zooplankton, including barnacle nauplii, veliger larvae, and adults of the copepod oithona sp., were characterized and quantified. barnacle nauplius and veliger larva harbored ~4.4 x 10(5)cells ind(-1) whereas oithona sp. had 8.8 x 10(5)cells ind(-1). computation  of bacterial contribution based on biovolume indicated that despite being the smallest zooplankton tested, veliger larvae harbored the highest number of bacteria, while barnacle nauplii, the largest of the zooplankton, tested in terms of volume contributed the least. pulverization of zooplankton led to an increase  in bacterial numbers; for example, vibrio cholerae, which was initially 3.5 x 10(3), increased to 5.4 x 10(5)cfu g(-1); escherichia coli increased from 5.0 x 10(2) to 1.3 x 10(4)cfu g(-1); and streptococcus faecalis increased from 2.1 x 10(2) to 2.5 x 10(5)cfu g(-1), respectively. pulverized zooplankton was aged in the dark to assess the contribution of bacteria from decaying debris. aging of pulverized zooplankton led to emergence of chromobacterium violaceum, which is an opportunistic pathogen in animals and humans.

TI  == bacterial lysates in food allergy prevention.
AB  == purpose of review: in the concept of food allergy prevention, no successful strategy could be identified until now. although interventional trials using probiotics, prebiotics, hydrolyzed formula and bacterial lysates early in infancy were found to reduce the incidence of atopic dermatitis, no effect on food sensitization and allergy could be shown. recent findings: studies in a farming environment showed that early contact to livestock, bacteria and moulds may upregulate the immune responses regulated via toll-like receptors and thus prevent allergy. there is increasing evidence that the unbalanced composition of  the human microbiome on human skin and mucosal surfaces may be a key player in the development of inflammatory diseases like allergy and asthma. however, during the last 5 years, this concept could not yet be verified in the interventional trials. there are few studies using bacterial lysates, for example, escherichia coli plus enterococcus faecalis in prosymbioflor and heat-killed bifidobacterium  breve and streptococcus thermophilus; however, food allergy prevalence could not  be reduced by these interventions. summary: during the last 5 years, new interventional trials addressed the use of bacterial lysates. there was only an effect on eczema in the prosymbioflor trial, whereas the trial using b. breve and s. thermophilus in a cow's milk formula showed a slight reduction of food sensitization at the age of 12 months. however, these strategies need further investigation and success seems to be restricted to certain subpopulations.

TI  == lysins: the arrival of pathogen-directed anti-infectives.
AB  == lysins represent a novel class of anti-infectives derived from bacteriophage. lysins are bacterial cell-wall hydrolytic enzymes that selectively and rapidly kill (>/=3 log c.f.u. in 30 min) specific gram-positive bacteria providing a targeted therapeutic approach with minimal impact on unrelated commensal flora. the potential for bacterial resistance to lysins is considered low due to targeting of highly conserved peptidoglycan components. through cutting-edge genetic engineering, lysins can be assembled into large libraries of anti-infective agents tailored to any bacterium of interest including drug-resistant gram-positive pathogens such as meticillin- and vancomycin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. lysins can eliminate bacteria systemically and topically from mucosal surfaces and biofilms, as evidenced by experimental models of sepsis, endocarditis, pneumonia, meningitis, and nasopharyngeal, skin and vaginal decolonization. furthermore, lysins can act synergistically with antibiotics and, in the process, resensitize bacteria to non-susceptible antibiotics. clinical trials are being prepared to assess the safety and pharmacokinetic properties of  lysins in humans.

TI  == regulation of the activity of lactate dehydrogenases from four lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == despite high similarity in sequence and catalytic properties, the l-lactate dehydrogenases (ldhs) in lactic acid bacteria (lab) display differences in their  regulation that may arise from their adaptation to different habitats. we combined experimental and computational approaches to investigate the effects of  fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (fbp), phosphate (pi), and ionic strength (nacl concentration) on six ldhs from four labs studied at ph 6 and ph 7. we found that 1) the extent of activation by fbp (kact) differs. lactobacillus plantarum ldh is not regulated by fbp, but the other ldhs are activated with increasing sensitivity in the following order: enterococcus faecalis ldh2 </= lactococcus lactis ldh2 < e. faecalis ldh1 < l. lactis ldh1 </= streptococcus pyogenes ldh. this trend reflects the electrostatic properties in the allosteric binding site of the ldh enzymes. 2) for l. plantarum, s. pyogenes, and e. faecalis, the effects of pi are distinguishable from the effect of changing ionic strength by adding nacl. 3) addition of pi inhibits e. faecalis ldh2, whereas in the absence  of fbp, pi is an activator of s. pyogenes ldh, e. faecalis ldh1, and l. lactis ldh1 and ldh2 at ph 6. these effects can be interpreted by considering the computed binding affinities of pi to the catalytic and allosteric binding sites of the enzymes modeled in protonation states corresponding to ph 6 and ph 7. overall, the results show a subtle interplay among the effects of pi, fbp, and ph that results in different regulatory effects on the ldhs of different labs.

AB  == background: patients with chronic periodontitis (cp) may yield multiple species of putative periodontal bacterial pathogens that vary in their antibiotic drug susceptibility. this study determines the occurrence of in vitro antibiotic resistance among selected subgingival periodontal pathogens in patients with cp.  methods: subgingival biofilm specimens from inflamed deep periodontal pockets were removed before treatment from 400 adults with cp in the united states. the samples were cultured, and selected periodontal pathogens were tested in vitro for susceptibility to amoxicillin at 8 mg/l, clindamycin at 4 mg/l, doxycycline at 4 mg/l, and metronidazole at 16 mg/l, with a post hoc combination of data for  amoxicillin and metronidazole. gram-negative enteric rods/pseudomonads were subjected to ciprofloxacin disk-diffusion testing. results: overall, 74.2% of the patients with cp revealed subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant to at least one of the test antibiotics. one or more test species, most often prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, streptococcus constellatus, or aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, were resistant in vitro to doxycycline, amoxicillin, metronidazole, or clindamycin, in 55%, 43.3%, 30.3%, and 26.5% of the patients with cp, respectively. fifteen percent of patients harbored subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant to both amoxicillin and metronidazole, which were mostly either s. constellatus (45 individuals) or ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains of gram-negative enteric rods/pseudomonads (nine individuals). conclusions: patients with cp in the united states frequently yielded subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant in vitro to therapeutic concentrations of antibiotics commonly used in clinical periodontal practice. the wide variability  found in periodontal pathogen antibiotic-resistance patterns should concern clinicians empirically selecting antibiotic treatment regimens for patients with  cp.

TI  == volatile metabolites of pathogens: a systematic review.
AB  == ideally, invading bacteria are detected as early as possible in critically ill patients: the strain of morbific pathogens is identified rapidly, and antimicrobial sensitivity is known well before the start of new antimicrobial therapy. bacteria have a distinct metabolism, part of which results in the production of bacteria-specific volatile organic compounds (vocs), which might be used for diagnostic purposes. volatile metabolites can be investigated directly in exhaled air, allowing for noninvasive monitoring. the aim of this review is to provide an overview of vocs produced by the six most abundant and pathogenic bacteria in sepsis, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli. such vocs could be used as biological markers in the diagnostic approach of critically ill patients. a systematic review of existing literature revealed 31 articles. all six bacteria of interest produce isopentanol, formaldehyde, methyl mercaptan, and trimethylamine. since humans do not produce these vocs, they could serve as biological markers for presence of these pathogens. the following volatile biomarkers were found for identification of specific strains: isovaleric acid and 2-methyl-butanal for staphylococcus aureus; 1-undecene, 2,4-dimethyl-1-heptane, 2-butanone, 4-methyl-quinazoline, hydrogen cyanide, and methyl thiocyanide for pseudomonas aeruginosa; and methanol, pentanol, ethyl acetate, and indole for escherichia coli. notably, several factors that may effect voc production were not controlled for, including used culture media, bacterial growth phase, and genomic variation within bacterial strains. in conclusion, vocs produced by bacteria may serve as biological markers for their presence. goal-targeted studies should be performed to identify potential sets of volatile biological markers and evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of these markers in critically ill patients.

TI  == effect of metalloporphyrins on red autofluorescence from oral bacteria.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess the red autofluorescence from bacterial species related to dental caries and periodontitis in the presence of different nutrients in the growth medium. bacteria were grown anaerobically on tryptic soy  agar (tsa) supplemented with nutrients, including magnesium-porphyrins from spinach and iron-porphyrins from heme. the autofluorescence was then assessed at  405 nm excitation. on the tsa without additives, no autofluorescence was observed from any of the species tested. on the tsa containing sheep blood, red autofluorescence was observed only from parvimonas micra. when the tsa was supplemented with blood, hemin, and vitamin k, red autofluorescence was observed  from actinomyces naeslundii, bifidobacterium dentium, and streptococcus mutans. finally, on the tsa supplemented with spinach extract, red autofluorescence was observed from aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, a. naeslundii, enterococcus  faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus salivarius, s. mutans, and veillonella parvula. we conclude that the bacteria related to dental caries and periodontal disease exhibit red autofluorescence. the autofluorescence characteristics of the tested strains depended on the nutrients present, such as  metalloporphyrins, suggesting that the metabolic products of the oral biofilm could be responsible for red autofluorescence.

TI  == identification of pathogens in mastitis milk samples with fluorescent in situ hybridization.
AB  == traditionally, the bacteriological examination of mastitis milk samples is performed by culture followed by biochemical tests on the cultured bacteria to allow identification of the causative pathogen. depending on the species involved, this classic identification is time-consuming compared to other techniques such as fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish), a culture-independent method that utilizes oligonucleotides (labeled with a fluorophore) that are specific to a string of target dna/rna. in the current study, the applicability of fish was evaluated for the detection of mastitis pathogens directly in milk samples. to remove interfering lipids and proteins from mastitis milk samples prior to fish, a previously published enzymatic treatment with savinase was evaluated. fish was performed using oligonucleotides  specific for staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus uberis, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, and trueperella (arcanobacterium) pyogenes. the enzymatic pretreatment and the sensitivity of fish were evaluated using spiked whole milk samples and mastitis milk samples with bacterial loads of less than 10(3) up to 10(8) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. bacteria were reliably detected in milk samples with bacterial numbers of 10(6) cfu/ml or higher. however, bacteria present in numbers below 10(6) cfu/ml were not detectable in all cases. the ability of fish to identify mastitis-causing pathogens directly in milk samples, and therefore earlier than classical culture methods, can supplement the classic diagnostic procedures for mastitis milk samples.

TI  == antibacterial serrulatane diterpenes from the australian native plant eremophila  microtheca.
AB  == chemical investigations of the aerial parts of the australian plant eremophila microtheca resulted in the isolation of three serrulatane diterpenoids, 3-acetoxy-7,8-dihydroxyserrulat-14-en-19-oic acid (1), 3,7,8-trihydroxyserrulat-14-en-19-oic acid (2) and 3,19-diacetoxy-8-hydroxyserrulat-14-ene (3) as well as the previously reported compounds verbascoside (4) and jaceosidin (5). acetylation and methylation of the major serrulatane diterpenoid 2 afforded 3,8-diacetoxy-7-hydroxyserrulat-14-en-19-oic acid (6) and 3,7,8-trihydroxyserrulat-14-en-19-oic acid methyl ester (7), respectively. the antibacterial activity of 1-7 was assessed against a panel of gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial isolates. all of the serrulatane compounds exhibited moderate activity against streptococcus pyogenes (atcc 12344) with minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) ranging from 64-128 mug/ml. serrulatane 1 demonstrated activity against all gram-positive bacterial strains (mics 64-128 mug/ml) except for enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium. this is the first report of natural products from e. microtheca.

TI  == evaluation of the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test for rapid detection of bacteria and resistance determinants.
AB  == rapid identification of pathogens from blood cultures can decrease lengths of stay and improve patient outcomes. we evaluated the accuracy of the verigene gram-positive blood culture (bc-gp) nucleic acid test for investigational use only (nanosphere, inc., northbrook, il) for the identification of gram-positive bacteria from blood cultures. the detection of resistance genes (meca in staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis and vana or vanb in enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis) by the bc-gp assay also was assessed. a total of 186 positive blood cultures (in bact/alert fa bottles) with  gram-positive cocci observed with gram staining were analyzed using the bc-gp assay. the bc-gp results were compared with the identification and susceptibility profiles obtained with routine methods in the clinical laboratory. discordant results were arbitrated with additional biochemical, cefoxitin disk, and repeat bc-gp testing. the initial bc-gp organism identification was concordant with routine method results for 94.6% of the blood cultures. only 40% of the streptococcus pneumoniae identifications were correct. the detection of the meca  gene for 69 blood cultures with only s. aureus or s. epidermidis was concordant with susceptibility testing results. for 3 of 6 cultures with multiple staphylococcus spp., meca detection was reported but was correlated with oxacillin resistance in a species other than s. aureus or s. epidermidis. the detection of vana agreed with susceptibility testing results for 45 of 46 cultures with e. faecalis or e. faecium. comparison of the mean times to results  for each organism group showed that bc-gp results were available 31 to 42 h earlier than phenotypic identifications and 41 to 50 h earlier than susceptibility results.

TI  == design, synthesis, and antibacterial activity of demethylvancomycin analogues against drug-resistant bacteria.
AB  == five novel n-substituted demethylvancomycin derivatives were rationally designed  and synthesized by using a structure-based approach. the in vitro antibacterial activities against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), gentamicin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (gre), methicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (mrs), and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vre) were evaluated. one of the compounds, n-(6-phenylheptyl)demethylvancomycin  (12 a), was found to exhibit more potent antibacterial activity than vancomycin and demethylvancomycin. compound 12 a was also found to be ~18-fold more efficacious than vancomycin against mrsa; however, the two compounds were found to have similar efficacy against mrs. furthermore, compound 12 a exhibited a favorable pharmacokinetic profile with a half-life of 5.11+/-0.52 h, which is longer than that of vancomycin (4.3+/-1.9 h). these results suggest that 12 a is  a promising antibacterial drug candidate for further preclinical evaluation.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance of enterococcus species from meat and fermented meat products isolated by a pcr-based rapid screening method.
AB  == enterococci are predominantly found in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals, but species commonly resident on vegetation are known. their presence in large numbers in foods may indicate a lapse in sanitation and their ability to serve as a genetic reservoir of transferable antibiotic resistance is of concern. conventional culture methods for identification of enterococci are slow and sometimes give false results because of the biochemical diversity of the organisms in this genus. this work reports the development of a pcr-based assay to detect enterococci at the genus level by targeting a 16s rrna sequence. published 16s rrna sequences were aligned and used to design genus specific primers (entf and entr). the primers were able to amplify a 678 bp target region  from enterococcus faecalis atcc 7080 and 20 other strains of enterococci from 11  different species, but there was no amplification by 32 species from closely related genera (pediococcus, lactobacillus, streptococcus and listeria) or species of escherichia coli and salmonella. the pcr positive samples were plated, screened by a colony patch technique and their identities were confirmed by api 20 strep panels and sequencing. when dry fermented sausage and ham as well as fresh meat batter for dry cured sausage manufacture were tested for enterococci by the method, 29 enterococcus strains (15 e. faecalis, 13 e. faecium, and one e. gallinarum) were identified. when susceptibility of these enterococci to 12 antibiotics was tested, the highest incidence of resistance was to clindamycin (89.6%), followed by tetracycline hydrochloride (65.5%), tylosin (62%), erythromycin (45%), streptomycin and neomycin (17%), chloramphenicol (10.3%), penicillin (10.3%), ciprofloxacin (10.3%) and gentamicin (3.4%). none was resistant to the clinically important drugs vancomycin or ampicillin. most strains (27/29) were resistant to more than one antibiotic while 17 of 29 strains were resistant to three to 8 antibiotics. the molecular method developed was validated for speciation of enterococci and was useful in assessing uncooked processed meat products as a reservoir for multi-drug resistant enterococcus species.

TI  == cd137 expressed on neutrophils plays dual roles in antibacterial responses against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections.
AB  == severe sepsis and septic shock caused mainly by bacterial infections are life-threatening conditions that urge the development of novel therapies. however, host responses to and pathophysiology of sepsis have not been clearly understood, which remains a major obstacle for the development of effective therapeutics. recently, we have shown that stimulation of a costimulatory molecule, cd137, enhanced survival of mice infected with the gram-positive (g(+)) intracellular bacterium listeria monocytogenes but decreased survival in a polymicrobial sepsis model. herein, we report that cd137 deficiency or blocking of cd137 signaling decreased antibacterial responses of mice infected with g(+) bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis) but increased these responses in mice infected with gram-negative (g(-)) bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium). consistent with these findings, stimulation of cd137 by administration of agonistic antibody enhanced responses against g(+) bacteria, whereas it decreased these responses against g(-) bacteria. neutrophils were responsible for cd137-mediated opposite roles in control of g(+) and g(-) bacterial infections. stimulation of cd137 enhanced activities of neutrophils against s. aureus but decreased these activities against e. coli, while cd137 blocking produced opposite results with the stimulation of cd137 in vivo and in vitro. furthermore, we found that combined signaling of cd137 and toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2) induced synergistic production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) and interleukin-6 (il-6) by neutrophils, but combined signaling of cd137 and tlr4 did not. our data strongly suggest that cd137 may play a dual role in sepsis in association with tlrs.

TI  == diversity of streptococcus mutans strains in bacterial interspecies interactions.
AB  == biofilms are matrix-enclosed microbial population adhere to each other and to surfaces. compared to planktonic bacterial cells, biofilm cells show much higher  levels of antimicrobial resistance. we aimed to investigate streptococcus mutans  strain diversity in biofilm formation and chlorhexidine (chx) resistance of single s. mutans and dual s. mutans-enterococcus faecalis biofilms. four clinical s. mutans strains (c180-2, c67-1, hg723 and ua159) formed 24-h biofilms with or without an e. faecalis strain. these biofilms were treated for 10 min with 0.025% chx. biofilm formation, chx resistance and s.mutans-e. faecalis interactions were evaluated by biomass staining, resazurin metabolism, viable count and competition agar assays. the main finding is that the presence of e. faecalis generally reduced all dual-species biofilm formation, but the proportions of s. mutans in the dual-species biofilms as well as chx resistance displayed a clear s. mutans strain dependence. in particular, decreased resistance against chx was observed in dual s. mutans c67-1 biofilms, while increased resistance was found in dual s. mutans ua159 biofilms. in conclusion, the interaction of s. mutans with e. faecalis in biofilms varies between strains, which underlines the importance of studying strain diversity in inter-species virulence modulation and biofilm antimicrobial resistance.

AB  == sepsis is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates worldwide. rapid and reliable diagnostic methods are needed for efficient and evidence-based treatment of septic patients. recently, new molecular tools have emerged to complement the  conventional culture-based diagnostic methods. in this study, we used spiked whole blood samples to evaluate together two ready-to-use molecular solutions for the detection of sepsis-causing bacteria. we spiked whole blood with bacterial species relevant in sepsis and extracted bacterial dna with the nordiag arrow device, using the selectna blood pathogen dna isolation kit. dna extracts were analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction (pcr)- and microarray-based prove-it bone and joint assay, resulting in correctly identified bacterial species with detection limits of 11-600 colony-forming unit/ml (cfu/ml). to understand the recovery losses of bacterial dna during the sample preparation step and the capability of the pcr- and microarray-based platform to respond to the sensitivity requirements, we also determined the analytical sensitivity of the pcr and microarray platform to be 1-21 genome equivalents for the tested bacterial species. in addition, the inclusivity of the prove-it bone and joint assay was demonstrated with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) clones carrying sccmec types i, ii, iv, or v and a nontypable sccmec type. the proof-of-concept for accurate multiplex pathogen and antibacterial resistance marker detection from spiked whole blood samples was demonstrated by the selective bacterial dna extraction method combined with the high-throughput pcr-  and microarray-based platform. further investigations are needed to study the promising potential of the concept for sensitive, semi-automated identification of sepsis-causing pathogens directly from whole blood.

AB  == enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus mitis are common commensal inhabitants of the human gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. however, both species can be opportunistic pathogens and cause disease in nosocomial settings. these infections can be difficult to treat because of the frequency of antibiotic resistance among these strains. bacteriophages are often suggested as an alternative therapeutic agent against these infections. in this study, e. faecalis and s. mitis strains were isolated from female patients with urinary tract infections. bacteriophages active against these strains were isolated from  sewage water from the mtkvari river. two phages, designated vb_efas_gec-efs_3 (syphoviridae) and vb_smm_gec-smitism_2 (myoviridae), were specific for e. faecalis and s. mitis, respectively. each phage's growth patterns and adsorption  rates were quantified. sensitivity to ultraviolet light and temperature was determined, as was host range and serology. the s. mitis bacteriophage was found  to be more resistant to ultraviolet light and exposure to high temperatures than  the e. faecalis bacteriophage, despite having a much greater rate of replication. while each phage was able to infect a broad range of strains of the same species  as the host species from which they were isolated, they were unable to infect other host species tested.

AB  == bloodstream infections (bsis) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and impose considerable costs on healthcare systems. a key predictor of clinical outcomes in patients with bsis is the early initiation of appropriate targeted antimicrobial therapy. however, with conventional blood culture methods, the gold standard, there is a significant time delay of approximately 2-3 days before clinical results are available, with many patients receiving inappropriate and/or unnecessary antimicrobial therapy in the interim. during the past two decades, the use of in vitro assays that utilize nucleic acid amplification-based detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns has led to a significant reduction in the time (hours vs. days with blood culture) to detection and identification of several of the causative pathogens of bsis and, potentially, earlier initiation of targeted antimicrobial therapy. this review focuses on the  properties and clinical use of one of these molecular diagnostic assays, the verigene((r)) gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test (bc-gp), which detects many of the potentially pathogenic gram-positive bacteria associated with bsis, including staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., listeria spp., and enterococcus spp., and specific resistance markers (meca, vana, and vanb). based  on more than 1,600 samples, there was a high degree of agreement between bc-gp test results and those obtained using conventional blood culture and assay methods, irrespective of whether samples were fresh or frozen, and a high degree  of agreement for identification of meca-mediated meticillin resistance in s. aureus and s. epidermidis organisms and vana- or vanb-mediated vancomycin resistance in e. faecalis and e. faecium organisms.

TI  == comparing effects of freezing at -196 degrees c and -20 degrees c on the viability of mastitis pathogens.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare the effects of cryopreservation at approximately -196 degrees c in liquid nitrogen (n) and freezing at approximately -20 degrees c in a freezer, on the viability and survival of eight different mastitogenic bacteria inoculated in milk. bacteria were frozen at approximately -20 degrees c in a freezer and cryopreserved at approximately -196 degrees c in liquid nitrogen. an effective preservation method was needed for follow-up samples from cows identified in the south african national milk recording scheme  (nmrs) with somatic cell counts above 250 000 cells/ml milk. the organisation responsible for sample collection of the nmrs milk samples also provides producers with liquid nitrogen for their semen flasks at the collection sites. this existing mode of storage and transport could therefore be utilised.ten samples of each organism were thawed and cultured bi-weekly until week 18 for both temperature treatments. an additional sampling was performed at week 30 for  samples frozen at approximately -20 degrees c. freezing and cryopreservation did  not impair subsequent isolation of streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus (sth) (phage type lytic group iii) or sta. aureus (sta) (phage typed, other than lytic group iii). survival was indicated by the isolation of bacteria from samples, and viability by the strength of growth of the bacteria isolated. the survival of streptococcus agalactiae decreased after week 12 and escherichia coli after week 16 of freezing, but both organisms survived under cryogenic preservation until week 18. coagulase-negative staphylococci survived until week 18 for both freezing and cryogenic preservation.both storage methods could thus contribute to the improvement of a pro-active approach towards udder health management in south african dairy herds.

TI  == in vitro activity of telavancin and comparators against selected groups of gram-positive cocci.
AB  == telavancin is a novel, rapidly cidal, dual-action glycopeptide. this study examined its in vitro activity against relevant gram-positive pathogens, comprising 99 meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), 40 meticillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa), 79 coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), 45 enterococcus faecalis, 60 enterococcus faecium, 40 beta-haemolytic streptococci and 60 streptococcus pneumoniae. except with vana enterococci, telavancin mics were tightly clustered and unimodal. telavancin mics for staphylococci ranged from </=0.03 mg/l to 0.5mg/l, with no shift for mrsa or mssa in relation to vancomycin mic. nevertheless, and independently of species, cons with raised vancomycin mics had reduced susceptibility to telavancin, however this was much more marked for teicoplanin. modal telavancin mics were 0.5mg/l and </=0.03 mg/l for glycopeptide-susceptible e. faecalis and e. faecium, respectively, with no rise for vanb isolates, but ranges rose to 4-16 mg/l and 1-4 mg/l for vana isolates, respectively. streptococci were consistently susceptible, with mics of </=0.06 mg/l. telavancin mics by etest agreed within 1  doubling dilution with those found previously by bsac agar dilution in 96.2% of cases, although with slight bias towards lower values. in the few cases (13/345)  where telavancin mics by etest were >/=2 doubling dilutions different from those  by agar dilution, the etest value was always lower; this effect was greater for the other antibiotics tested. telavancin had excellent activity, except against enterococci with vana, with no erosion of this activity against mrsa with raised  vancomycin mics. mics by etest were nearly always within 1 dilution of those by bsac agar dilution.

TI  == circulating microrna signatures in mice exposed to lipoteichoic acid.
AB  == background: previously, we had identified a specific whole blood-derived micrornas (mirnas) signature in mice following in vivo injection of lipopolysaccharide (lps) originated from gram-negative bacteria. this study was designed to profile the circulating mirnas expression in mice exposed to lipoteichoic acid (lta) which is a major component of the wall of gram-positive bacteria. results: c57bl/6 mice received intraperitoneal injections of 100 mug of lta originated from bacillus subtilis, streptococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus were killed 6 h and the whole blood samples were obtained for mirna expression analysis using a mirna array (phalanx mirna onearray(r) 1.0). up-regulated expression of mirna targets in the whole blood, serum and white blood cells (wbcs) of c57bl/6 and tlr2-/- mice upon lta treatment in 10, 100, or  1000 ug concentrations was quantified at indicated time (2, 6, 24, and 72 h) using real-time rt-pcr and compared with that in the serum of c57bl/6 mice injected with 100 ug of lps. a significant increase of 4 mirnas (mir-451, mir-668, mir-1902, and mir-1904) was observed in the whole blood and the serum in a dose- and time-dependent fashion following lta injection. induction of mirna occurred in the serum after 2 h and persisted for at least 6 h. no increased expression of these 4 mirnas was found in the wbcs. higher but not significant expression level of these 4 mirnas were observed following lta treatment in the serum of tlr2-/-against that of c57bl6 mice. in contrast, lps exposure induced moderate expression of mir-451 but not of the other 3 mirna targets. conclusions: we identified a specific circulating mirna signature in mice exposed to lta. that expression profile is different from those of mice exposed to lps. those circulating mirnas induced by lta or lps treatment may serve as promising biomarkers for the differentiation between exposures to gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == enterococcus faecium isolated from lombo, a portuguese traditional meat product:  characterisation of antibacterial compounds and factors affecting bacteriocin production.
AB  == strain st211ch, identified as a strain of enterococcus faecium, isolated from lombo produced a bacteriocin that inhibited the growth of enterococcus spp., listeria spp., klebsiella spp., lactobacillus spp., pseudomonas spp., staphylococcus spp. and streptococcus spp. the mode of action of the bacteriocin  named as bacteriocin st211ch was bactericidal against enterococcus faecalis atcc19443. as determined by tricine-sds-page, the approximate molecular mass of the bacteriocin was 8.0 kda. loss in antimicrobial activity was recorded after treatment with proteolytic enzymes. maximum activity of bacteriocin st211ch was measured in broth cultures of e. faecium strain st211ch after 24 h; thereafter, the activity was reduced. bacteriocin st211ch remained active after exposure to various temperatures and phs, as well as to triton x-100, tween-80, tween-20, sodium dodecyl sulfate, nacl, urea and edta. effect of media components on production of bacteriocin st211ch was also studied. on the basis of pcr reactions targeting different bacteriocin genes, i.e. enterocins, curvacins and sakacins, no evidences for the presence of these genes in the total dna of e. faecium strain st211ch was obtained. the bacterium most probably produced a bacteriocin different from those mentioned above. based on the antimicrobial spectrum, stability and mode of action of bacteriocin st211ch, e. faecium strain st211ch might be considered as a potential candidate with beneficial properties for use in biopreservation to control food spoilage bacteria.

TI  == streptococcus gordonii collagen-binding domain protein cbda may enhance bacterial survival in instrumented root canals ex vivo.
AB  == introduction: the surface-associated collagen-binding protein ace of enterococcus faecalis has been implicated as a virulence factor that contributes to bacterial  persistence in endodontic infections. the purpose of this study was to determine  if proteins with amino acid sequence similarity to ace found in more abundant oral streptococci could play a similar role in potentially enhancing endodontic infections. methods: a streptococcus gordonii gene similar to ace was identified  by genome sequence searches in silico. an isogenic derivative of strain dl1 with  a disruption in the identified gene was constructed by allelic replacement. parent and mutant strains were characterized for their ability to bind immobilized collagen type 1 in a microtiter plate-binding assay. survival of the  strains in a human tooth ex vivo-instrumented root canal model was compared by inoculating canals with parental or mutant bacteria and determining the colony-forming units (cfus) recovered at various time points over a 12-day period. results: the s. gordonii gene, encoding a protein with a conserved collagen-binding domain similar to that of ace, was designated cbda. the cbda-deficient cells were less able to bind collagen type 1 than parental cells (p < .0001). genetic complementation of the cbda-deficient strain restored the collagen-binding phenotype. by day 12, significantly fewer (p = .03) cbda-deficient than parental cfus were recovered from instrumented canals. conclusions: a gene encoding a putative collagen-binding protein was identified in s. gordonii. fewer s. gordonii cbda-deficient cells survived ex vivo compared  with parental cells, suggesting that collagen-binding proteins may contribute to  the persistence of oral streptococci in instrumented root canals.

TI  == bacteriocin production, antibiotic susceptibility and prevalence of haemolytic and gelatinase activity in faecal lactic acid bacteria isolated from healthy ethiopian infants.
AB  == the objective of this study was to characterise lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from faecal samples of healthy ethiopian infants, with emphasis on bacteriocin production and antibiotic susceptibility. one hundred fifty lab were  obtained from 28 healthy ethiopian infants. the isolates belonged to lactobacillus (81/150), enterococcus (54/150) and streptococcus (15/150) genera.  lactobacillus species were more abundant in the breast-fed infants while enterococcus dominated the mixed-fed population. bacteriocin-producing lab species were isolated from eight of the infants. many different bacteriocins were identified, including one new bacteriocin from streptococcus salivarius, avicin a (class iia) from enterococcus avium, one class iia bacteriocin from enterococcus  faecalis strains, one unknown bacteriocin from e. faecalis and two unknown bacteriocins from lactobacillus fermentum strains and the two-peptide gassericin  t from lactobacillus gasseri isolate. susceptibility tests performed for nine antibiotics suggest that some lactobacilli might have acquired resistance to erythromycin (3 %) and tetracycline (4 %) only. the streptococci were generally antibiotic sensitive except for penicillin, to which they showed intermediate resistance. all enterococci were susceptible to ampicillin while 13 % showed penicillin resistance. only one e. faecalis isolate was vancomycin-resistant. tetracycline (51 %) and erythromycin (26 %) resistance was prevalent among the enterococci, but multidrug resistance was confined to e. faecalis (47 %) and enterococcus faecium (33 %). screening of enterococcal virulence traits revealed  that 2 % were beta-haemolytic. the structural genes of cytolysin were detected in 28 % of the isolates in five enterococcal species, the majority being e. faecalis and enterococcus raffinosus. this study shows that bacteriocin production and antibiotic resistance is a common trait of faecal lab of ethiopian infants while  virulence factors occur at low levels.

AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (apdt) using visible light together with water-filtered infrared-a (vis+wira) to eradicate single species of planktonic bacteria and micro-organisms during initial oral bacterial colonization in situ. a broadband vis+wira radiator with a water-filtered spectrum in the range 580-1400 nm was used for irradiation. toluidine blue (tb) was utilized as a photosensitizer at concentrations of 5, 10, 25 and 50 microg ml(-1). the unweighted (absolute) irradiance was 200 mw cm(-2) and it was applied for 1 min. planktonic cultures of streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis were treated with apdt. salivary bacteria harvested by centrifugation of native human saliva were also tested. in  addition, initial bacterial colonization of bovine enamel slabs carried in the mouths of six healthy volunteers was treated in the same way. up to 2 log(10) of  s. mutans and e. faecalis were killed by apdt. salivary bacteria were eliminated  to a higher extent of 3.7-5 log(10). all tb concentrations tested proved to be highly effective. the killing rate of bacteria in the initial oral bacterial colonization was significant (p=0.004) at all tested tb concentrations, despite the interindividual variations found among study participants. this study has shown that apdt in combination with tb and vis+wira is a promising method for killing bacteria during initial oral colonization. taking the healing effects of  wira on human tissue into consideration, this technique could be helpful in the treatment of peri-implantitis and periodontitis.

TI  == enterococcus and streptococcus spp. associated with chronic and self-medicated urinary tract infections in vietnam.
AB  == background: urinary tract infections (uti) are one of the most common infections  among women worldwide. e. coli often causes more than 75% of acute uncomplicated  uti, however, little is known about how recurrent utis and indiscriminate use of  antimicrobials affect the aetiology of utis. this study aimed to establish the aetiology of uti in a population of recurrent and self-medicated patients referred from pharmacies to a hospital in hanoi, vietnam and to describe genotypes and antimicrobial susceptibility of the associated bacterial pathogens. the aetiology of bacterial pathogens associated with uti (defined as >/= 104 cfu/ml urine) was established by phenotypic and molecular methods. enterococcus faecalis isolates were typed by multi locus sequence typing (mlst), pulsed-field  gel electrophoresis (pfge) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. methods: urine samples from 276 patients suffering symptoms of urinary tract infection were collected and cultured on flexicult agar(r) allowing for detection of the most common urine pathogens. patients were interviewed about underlying diseases, duration of symptoms, earlier episodes of uti, number of episodes diagnosed by doctors and treatment in relation to uti. all tentative e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates were identified to species level by pcr, 16s rrna and partial sequencing of the groel gene. e. faecalis isolates were further characterized by  multi locus sequence typing and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. results: mean age of 49 patients was 48 yrs (range was 11-86 yrs) and included 94% women.  on average, patients reported to have suffered from uti for 348 days (range 3 days-10 years, and experienced 2.7 utis during the previous year). cephalosporins were reported the second drug of choice in treatment of uti at the hospital. e. faecalis (55.1%), e. coli (12.2%) and streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (8.2%) were main bacterial pathogens. mic testing of e. faecalis showed susceptibility to ampicillin, penicillin and vancomycin, but high-level resistance against gentamicin (48.1%). mlst revealed 12 sequence types (st) of which st 16 made up 44.5% and showed closely related pfge types. conclusion: the  different aetiology of uti compared with reports elsewhere, where e. coli dominates, may be a result of chronic and recurrent utis together with indiscriminate use of antimicrobials. the similar genotypes shown by epidemiologically unrelated st 16 isolates in vietnam and elsewhere, suggest that e. faecalis st 16 might represent a globally distributed clone. treatment of uti  with cephalosporins may select for e. faecalis as it is intrinsic resistant and further studies are needed to establish the source(s) and role of e. faecalis st  16 in acute uti.

AB  == background: a major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. the objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. method: bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an elisa plate reader and zymography. results: we identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. of these, six were gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium, and streptococcus bovis) and seven were gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis,  morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and serratia marcescens) organisms. two of these, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, are recognized  wound pathogens. conclusions: multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.

TI  == the changing epidemiology of bacteraemias in europe: trends from the european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system.
AB  == we investigated bacteraemia trends for five major bacterial pathogens, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, and determined how expanding antimicrobial resistance influenced the total burden of bacteraemias in europe. aetiological fractions of species and antibiotic phenotypes were extracted from the european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system (earss) database for laboratories, which consistently reported between 2002 and 2008. trend analyses used generalized linear models. robustness of results was assessed by iterative analysis for different geographic regions. from 2002 to 2008, the overall number  of reports increased annually by 6.4% (95% confidence interval (ci) 6.2-6.5%), from 46 095 to 67 876. in the subset of laboratories providing denominator information, the overall incidence increased from 0.58/1000 patient-days to 0.90/1000 patient-days (7.2% per year; 95% ci 6.9-7.5%). the frequency of reported bacteraemia isolates of s. aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae increased moderately, while increase in e. coli and enterococcus faecium was more pronounced. bacteraemias caused by methicillin-resistant s. aureus increased until 2005 (7.6% per year; 95% ci 6.1-9.1%), and then decreased (-4.8% per year;  95% ci -6.1 to -3.5%), whereas the number attributable to methicillin-sensitive s. aureus increased continuously (3.4% per year; 95% ci 3.0-3.7). increasing rates of e. coli were mainly caused by antibiotic-resistant phenotypes. our data  suggest that the burden of bacterial bloodstream infection has been increasing for all species during earss surveillance. trends were mainly driven by resistant strains and clearly dissociated between resistant and susceptible isolates. it appears that infections with resistant clones add to rather than replace infections caused by susceptible bacteria. as a consequence, expansion of antibiotic resistance creates an additional strain on healthcare systems.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of a range of probiotics against pathogens: evidence for the effects of organic acids.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial properties of fifteen  selected strains belonging to the lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, lactococcus, streptococcus and bacillus genera against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic bacteria. in vitro antibacterial activity was initially investigated by an agar spot method. results from the agar spot test showed that most of the selected strains were able to produce active compounds on solid media with antagonistic properties against salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and clostridium difficile. these results were also confirmed when cell-free culture supernatants (cfcs) from the putative probiotics were used in an agar well diffusion assay. neutralization of  the culture supernatants with alkali reduced the antagonistic effects. these experiments are able to confirm the capacity of potential probiotics to inhibit selected pathogens. one of the main inhibitory mechanisms may result from the production of organic acids from glucose fermentation and consequent lowering of  culture ph. this observation was confirmed when the profile of organic acids was  analysed demonstrating that lactic and acetic acid were the principal end products of probiotic metabolism. furthermore, the assessment of the haemolytic activity and the susceptibility of the strains to the most commonly used antimicrobials, considered as basic safety aspects, were also studied. the observed antimicrobial activity was mainly genus-specific, additionally significant differences could be observed among species.

TI  == non-tuberculous mycobacteria and their surface lipids efficiently induced il-17 production in human t cells.
AB  == interleukin-17 (il-17) is produced by a subset of cd4(+) t helper (th) lymphocytes known as th17 cells. in humans, il-1beta, enhanced by il-6 and il-23  is crucial for differentiation of these cells. il-17 evokes inflammation and is involved in host defence against microorganisms, although little is known about its role in diseases caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria. the genus mycobacterium contains both obligate and opportunistic pathogens as well as saprophytes, and the mycobacterial cell envelope is unique in its abundance of lipids. here we investigated il-17 and il-23 production in human pbmc in response to intact uv-inactivated mycobacteria and mycobacterial surface lipids from two opportunistic (mycobacterium avium and mycobacterium abscessus) and one generally non-pathogenic (mycobacterium gordonae) species. representative gram-positive (enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus mitis) and gram-negative (escherichia coli) bacteria were included as controls. intact mycobacteria induced production of large amounts of il-17, while il-17 responses to control bacteria were negligible. purified cd4(+) t cells, but not cd4-depleted cell fractions, produced this il-17. isolated mycobacterial surface lipids induced il-17, but not il-23 production. the ability of the non-tuberculous mycobacteria to induce il-17 production in cd4(+) t cells was the same regardless of the pathogenic potential  of the particular mycobacterial species.

TI  == molecular basis for different levels of tet(m) expression in streptococcus pneumoniae clinical isolates.
AB  == seventy-four unrelated clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae harboring the tet(m) gene were studied. seven strains with low tetracycline (tc) mics (0.25 to 0.5 mug/ml) were found to harbor truncated tet(m) alleles that were inactivated by different frameshift mutations. in contrast, five strains bore deletions in the tet(m) promoter region, among which four displayed increased tc  mics (16 to 64 mug/ml). the same promoter mutations were detected in tc-resistant mutants selected in vitro from various susceptible strains. sequence analysis revealed that these deletions might impede the formation of the transcriptional attenuator located immediately upstream of tet(m). expression in enterococcus faecalis of a tet(m) reporter gene transcribed from these promoter mutants conferred a level of tc resistance similar to that observed in the parental s. pneumoniae strains. these results show that different levels of tc susceptibility found in clinical isolates of s. pneumoniae can be explained by frameshift mutations within tet(m) and by alterations of the upstream transcriptional attenuator.

TI  == the pava-like fibronectin-binding protein of enterococcus faecalis, efba, is important for virulence in a mouse model of ascending urinary tract infection.
AB  == enterococcus faecalis is an established nosocomial pathogen, yet the pathogenesis of enterococcal infections, particularly of urinary tract infections (utis), remains to be fully elucidated. fibronectin-binding proteins have been identified as potent adhesins in pathogenic gram-positive cocci. here, we characterized efba, which is encoded by the enterococcal orthologue of streptococcus pneumoniae pava. similar to pava, the anchorless efba protein was localized to the enterococcal cell outer surface and bound to immobilized human fibronectin. in addition to abrogated efba expression, deletion of the efba gene eliminated efba  from the cell surface and drastically reduced the enterococcal cell binding to immobilized fibronectin. the deltaefba deletion mutant was highly attenuated vs wild-type in a murine ascending uti model, consistent with an increased tropism for the kidney relative to the bladder. these results provide the first evidence  that efba of e. faecalis plays a role in utis, probably contributing to the pathogenesis in this site.

AB  == ceftaroline fosamil is a cephalosporin antibacterial approved by the us food and  drug administration (fda) for use in the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (absssi) and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (cabp). after intravenous administration, ceftaroline fosamil is rapidly converted to its bioactive metabolite, ceftaroline. ceftaroline has broad-spectrum in vitro activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including contemporary resistant gram-positive phenotypes, such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and multidrug-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. because of its unique spectrum of activity, the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) designated ceftaroline as a member of a new subclass of beta-lactam antimicrobials, cephalosporins with anti-mrsa activity. the activity of ceftaroline against s. aureus extends to heteroresistant vancomycin-intermediate, vancomycin-intermediate, vancomycin-resistant and daptomycin-nonsusceptible isolates. ceftaroline has low  minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) for all tested species of streptococci,  and has potent activity against s. pneumoniae isolates with varying degrees of penicillin resistance. the activity of ceftaroline is limited against enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium and against anaerobes such as bacteroides fragilis. the in vitro activity of ceftaroline includes many gram-negative pathogens, but does not extend to bacteria that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, class b metallo-beta-lactamases or ampc cephalosporinases, or to most nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli. ceftaroline  fosamil has been studied for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssi) and community-acquired pneumonia (cap) in phase iii randomized, double-blind, international, multicentre noninferiority clinical trials. two identical trials (canvas 1 and canvas 2) compared the efficacy of ceftaroline fosamil with that of vancomycin plus aztreonam in 1378 adults with csssi. results demonstrated that ceftaroline was noninferior to vancomycin plus aztreonam, with 91.6% in the ceftaroline fosamil group (pooled analysis) achieving clinical response compared with 92.7% in the vancomycin plus aztreonam  group (difference -1.1%, 95% ci -4.2, 2.0). an additional analysis evaluated clinical cure in a subgroup of patients who met the fda guidance definition of absssi at treatment day 3. clinical response, defined as cessation of lesion spread and absence of fever, was 74.0% in the ceftaroline fosamil group compared  with 66.2% in the vancomycin plus aztreonam group (treatment difference 7.8%, 95% ci 1.3, 14.0). clinical efficacy of ceftaroline fosamil in 1240 hospitalized adults with cap was compared with that of ceftriaxone in two additional phase iii trials (focus 1 and focus 2). of note, because ceftriaxone does not have activity against mrsa, patients with confirmed or suspected mrsa cap were excluded from the focus trials. results demonstrated that ceftaroline was noninferior to ceftriaxone, with 84.3% in the ceftaroline fosamil group achieving clinical cure  compared with 77.7% in the ceftriaxone group (difference 6.7%, 95% ci 1.6, 11.8). an additional analysis of the trials was conducted in patients with moderate to severe cap and at least one proven typical bacterial pathogen at baseline (i.e. cabp). day 4 clinical response rates were 69.5% for ceftaroline and 59.4% for ceftriaxone (difference 10.1%, 95% ci -0.6, 20.6). in the phase iii trials, adverse event rates were similar between groups. overall, ceftaroline is well tolerated, which is consistent with the good safety and tolerability profile of the cephalosporin class. in summary, ceftaroline fosamil is a broad-spectrum parenteral cephalosporin with excellent in vitro activity against resistant gram-positive pathogens, including mrsa, as well as many common gram-negative organisms. it is a welcome treatment option for absssi and cabp.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance among gram-positive pathogens in saudi arabia.
AB  == several species of gram-positive cocci are major nosocomial or community pathogens associated with morbidity and mortality. here, we review the antimicrobial resistance among these pathogens in saudi arabia. in the last decades, antimicrobial resistance has increased among staphylococcus aureus in the kingdom with a growing prevalence of both nosocomial and community methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) isolates. as yet, no vancomycin-resistant  mrsa have been reported, although isolates with reduced susceptibility to the drug have been noted. currently, the prevalence of vancomycin-resistant entrococci (vre) is low; however, vre has been described in the kingdom as well as enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium isolates with high-level resistance to penicillin, sulfamethoxazole, macrolides, tetracycline, and aminoglycosides. in recent decades, the prevalence and rate of penicillin resistance and non-susceptibility among streptococcus pneumoniae isolates have increased in saudi arabia. the organism remains, however, susceptible to other beta-lactams and to quinolones. on the other hand, resistance to co-trimoxazole and tetracyclines is high and resistance to macrolides is on the increase.

TI  == identification, structural, and biochemical characterization of a group of large  csn2 proteins involved in crispr-mediated bacterial immunity.
AB  == many prokaryotic organisms acquire immunity against foreign genetic material by incorporating a short segment of foreign dna called spacer into chromosomal loci, termed clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (crisprs). the encoded rnas are processed into small fragments that guide the silencing of the invading genetic elements. the crispr-associated (cas) proteins are the main executioners of these processes. herein, we report the crystal structure of stu0660 of streptococcus thermophilus, a cas protein involved in the acquisition  of new spacers. by homotetramerization, stu0660 forms a central channel which is  decorated with basic amino acids and binds linear double-stranded dna (dsdna), but not circular dsdna. despite undetectably low sequence similarity, two n-terminal domains of stu0660 are similar to the entire structure of an enterococcus faecalis csn2 protein, which also forms a homotetramer and binds dsdna. thus, this work identifies a previously unknown group of stu0660-like csn2 proteins ( approximately 350 residues), which are larger than the known canonical csn2 proteins ( approximately 220 residues) by containing an extra c-terminal domain. the commonly present central channel in the two subgroups appears as a design to selectively interact with linear dsdna.

TI  == lantibiotic production by pathogenic microorganisms.
AB  == lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesised, post-translationally modified antimicrobial peptides produced by gram positive bacteria, many which have broad-ranging antimicrobial activities. lantibiotics have long been the subject of investigation with a view to their application as food preservatives or chemotherapeutic agents for clinical and veterinary medicine, while the associated biosynthetic machinery has been employed for peptide engineering purposes. however, although many lantibiotics are produced by generally regarded  as safe or food-grade bacteria, it is increasingly apparent that a number of gram positive pathogens, including strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus uberis and enterococcus faecalis, also produce these compounds. it is proposed that production of these antimicrobials may provide the associated microorganisms with a competitive advantage when colonizing/infecting  a host, thereby enhancing the virulence of the producing strain. here we review the production of lantibiotics by these pathogens and discuss how their production may contribute to their disease-causing potential.

TI  == improved identification including maldi-tof mass spectrometry analysis of group d streptococci from bovine mastitis and subsequent molecular characterization of corresponding enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium isolates.
AB  == we examined 199 group d streptococci isolated from clinically defined and epidemiologically unrelated cases of bovine mastitis. samples were collected during a 5-month period from 2010 to 2011 from diseased animals in 199 herds (1 isolate per herd) raised in different counties and federal states in germany. a classical enterococcal species identification procedure started with pyrase and catalase assays, growth on enterococcoselagar((r)) and gcg((r)) agar plates and in 6.5% nacl followed by a biochemical reaction panel. all 199 isolates were also subjected to maldi-tof ms diagnostics in which a simple and an extended direct transfer protocol were compared. the latter revealed a much better performance (higher log (score) values) although the same result was obtained in all but three cases. classical and maldi tof ms analyses identified 64 enterococcus faecalis and 37 enterococcus faecium isolates which were confirmed by species-specific pcrs. these 101 enterococcal isolates did not display a specific multi-resistance phenotype and resistances to glycopeptides and antibiotics of last resort (linezolid, daptomycin, tigecycline) were absent, resistance to tetracycline was the most frequent resistance feature. molecular typing of the 64 e. faecalis isolates revealed 3 main pfge clusters of related strains represented by three mlst types (st40, st211, st268). pfge and mlst analysis of e. faecium isolates revealed several smaller clusters of only a few related strains and identified a number of previously unknown allele and mlst types (n=6; st624-st629) besides known variants (st22, st32). one of the 37 e. faecium strains showed properties of hospital-associated e. faecium strains (ampicillin resistance, is16-positive; mlst cc17).

TI  == gender and age-dependent etiology of community-acquired urinary tract infections.
AB  == urinary tract infections (utis) are among the most frequent community-acquired infections worldwide. escherichia coli is the most common uti pathogen although underlying host factors such as patients' age and gender may influence prevalence of causative agents. in this study, 61 273 consecutive urine samples received over a 22-month period from outpatients clinics of an urban area of north italy underwent microbiological culture with subsequent bacterial identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of positive samples. a total of 13 820 uropathogens were isolated and their prevalence analyzed according to patient's gender and age group. overall escherichia coli accounted for 67.6% of all isolates, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (8.8%), enterococcus faecalis (6.3%), proteus mirabilis (5.2%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.5%). data stratification  according to both age and gender showed e. coli isolation rates to be lower in both males aged >/=60 years (52.2%), e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa being more prevalent in this group (11.6% and 7.8%, resp.), as well as in those aged </=14 years (51.3%) in whom p. mirabilis prevalence was found to be as high as 21.2%. streptococcus agalactiae overall prevalence was found to be 2.3% although it was  shown to occur most frequently in women aged between 15 and 59 years (4.1%). susceptibility of e. coli to oral antimicrobial agents was demonstrated to be as  follows: fosfomycin (72.9%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (72.9%), ciprofloxacin (76.8%), ampicillin (48.0%), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (77.5%). in conclusion,  both patients' age and gender are significant factors in determining utis etiology; they can increase accuracy in defining the causative uropathogen as well as providing useful guidance to empiric treatment.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of wild mushroom extracts against clinical isolates resistant to different antibiotics.
AB  == aims: this work aimed to screen the antimicrobial activity of aqueous methanolic  extracts of 13 mushroom species, collected in braganca, against several clinical  isolates obtained in hospital center of tras-os-montes and alto douro, portugal.  methods and results: microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc).  mic results showed that russula delica and fistulina hepatica extracts inhibited  the growth of gram-negative (escherichia coli, morganella morganni and pasteurella multocida) and gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, mrsa, enterococcus faecalis, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus pyogenes) bacteria. a bactericide effect of both extracts was observed in past. multocida, strep. agalactiae and strep. pyogenes with mbc of 20, 10 and 5 mg ml(-)(1), respectively. lepista nuda extract exhibited a bactericide effect upon past. multocida at 5 mg ml(-)(1) and inhibited proteus mirabilis at 20 mg ml(-)(1). ramaria botrytis extract showed activity against enterococcus faecalis and l. monocytogenes, being bactericide for past. multocida, strep. agalactiae (mbcs 20 mg ml(-)(1)) and strep. pyogenes (mbc 10 mg ml(-)(1)). leucopaxillus giganteus extract inhibited the growth of e. coli and pr. mirabilis, being bactericide for past. multocida, strep. pyogenes and strep.  agalactiae. conclusions: fistulina hepatica, r. botrytis and r. delica are the most promising species as antimicrobial agents. significance and impact of the study: mushroom extracts could be an alternative as antimicrobials against pathogenic micro-organisms resistant to conventional treatments.

TI  == decreased bacterial adherence and biofilm growth on surfaces coated with a solution of benzalkonium chloride.
AB  == introduction: secondary biofilm formation by oral bacteria after breakdown/fracture of temporary or permanent restorations imposes a challenge to  the outcome of root canal treatment. this study focuses on benzalkonium chloride  (bak) coating on dentin or polystyrene surfaces and its influence on the early adhesion and biofilm formation by oral and root canal bacteria. methods: microbial adhesion and biofilm growth on surfaces coated with bak were analyzed qualitatively with a dentin disk model and quantitatively with a mini-flow cell biofilm model. cell viability and total biovolume were analyzed by the live/dead  technique. the repelling effect of surfaces coated with bak was compared with naocl. uncoated surfaces were used as controls. results: scanning electron microscope images in the dentin disk model revealed that very sparse biofilms were formed on naocl- and bak-coated dentin surfaces. in contrast, biofilms formed on uncoated dentin were clearly visible as numerous irregularly distributed aggregates of rods and cocci. in the mini-flow cell system, confocal  laser scanning microscope analysis confirmed that biofilms formed on naocl- and bak-coated surfaces showed significantly less adhesion (2 hours) and biovolume accumulation (24 and 96 hours) compared with the uncoated controls (p < .01). furthermore, cell viability assessments showed that on uncoated controls the viability measurements were high (>89%) as well as on bak-coated surfaces (88% viable cells). however, cell viability was significantly reduced on naocl-coated  surfaces (59% viable cells). conclusions: this study illustrates that surface coating with a surfactant solution containing bak does not cause cell membrane damage but might interfere with cell mechanisms of adhesion. investigations into  the clinical utility of bak as an antibiofilm medication are warranted.

TI  == reproducible discrimination between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria using surface enhanced raman spectroscopy with infrared excitation.
AB  == the on time diagnostics of bacterial diseases is one of the essential steps in the foregoing treatment of such pathogens. here we sought to present an easy to use and robust method for the discrimination between gram-positive (enterococcus  faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes) and gram-negative (acinetobacter baumannii and klebsiella pneumoniae) bacterial genera based on surface enhanced raman scattering (sers) spectroscopy. the robustness of our approach lies in the novel  method for the production of the ser substrate based on silver nanoparticles and  their subsequent re-crystallization in solutions containing high concentrations of chloride ions. the method presented here could be an interesting alternative both to commonly used histochemical approaches and commercial sers substrates.

TI  == sensitivities of major causative organisms isolated from patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis against various antibacterial agents: results of subanalysis based on the presence of menopause.
AB  == we investigated whether the presence of menopause influenced the species and distribution of causative bacteria isolated from patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis (the most common urinary tract infection), and we also investigated the sensitivity of the isolated species to antibacterial agents. using multivariate analysis, we also investigated risk factors for infection with quinolone-resistant escherichia coli, because its frequency has increased and it  is now a clinical problem in japan. six hundred and thirty-four strains were isolated from 489 premenopausal patients (mean age 32.3 +/- 10.1 years). major causative bacteria detected were escherichia coli (65.0 %), enterococcus faecalis (12.0 %), streptococcus agalactiae (5.5 %), and klebsiella pneumoniae (1.6 %). from 501 postmenopausal patients (mean age 68.7 +/- 10.29 years), 657 strains were isolated, and the major causative bacteria detected were e. coli (61.5 %), e. faecalis (13.7 %), k. pneumoniae (5.2 %), and s. agalactiae (4.0 %). the sensitivities to fluoroquinolones (fqs) and cephems of e. coli isolated from premenopausal patients were both >/=90 %, while the sensitivities to fqs of e. coli isolated from postmenopausal patients were about 5 % lower. in regard to infection with quinolone-resistant e. coli (minimal inhibitory concentration of levofloxacin [lvfx] >/=4 mug/ml), significant risk factors were observed in patients with more than two episodes of cystitis within a year (p = 0.0002), patients to whom antibacterial agents were used previously for this episode of cystitis (p = 0.0175), and patients who had a history of fq administration within 1 month. although the species and distribution of causative bacteria of acute uncomplicated cystitis were the same regardless of the presence of menopause, the sensitivities to fqs of e. coli detected in postmenopausal patients were significantly lower than those in the premenopausal women. the major risk factors for infection with quinolone-resistant e. coli were a history of fq administration and the morbidity of cystitis rather than the menopausal status. it was considered that taking an appropriate history including the morbidity of cystitis and history of fq administration, and the appropriate selection of an antibacterial agent, would be important when empirical therapy is required.

TI  == isolation and characterization of signermycin b, an antibiotic that targets the dimerization domain of histidine kinase walk.
AB  == the walk (histidine kinase)/walr (response regulator) two-component signal transduction system is a master regulatory system for cell wall metabolism and growth. this system is conserved in low g+c gram-positive bacteria, including bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus mutans. in this study, we found the first antibiotic that functions as a walk inhibitor (signermycin b) by screening 10,000 streptomyces extracts. the chemical structure (c(23)h(35)no(4); molecular weight, 389.5) comprises a tetramic acid moiety and a decalin ring. signermycin b exhibited antimicrobial activity, with mic values ranging from 3.13 mug/ml (8 mum) to 6.25 mug/ml (16 mum) against gram-positive bacteria that possess the walk/walr two-component signal transduction system, including the drug-resistant bacteria methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis. the half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of signermycin b against walk in these organisms ranged from 37 to 61 mum. to determine the mechanism of action of signermycin b, surface plasmon resonance response analysis with the two walk domains of bacillus subtilis and competition assay with atp were performed.  the results showed that signermycin b binds to the dimerization domain but not the atp-binding domain of walk. in the presence of the cross-linker glutaraldehyde, signermycin b did not cause protein aggregation but interfered with the cross-linking of walk dimers. these results suggest that signermycin b targets the conserved dimerization domain of walk to inhibit autophosphorylation. in bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus, signermycin b preferentially controlled the walr regulon, thereby inhibiting cell division. these phenotypes are consistent with those of cells starved for the walk/walr system.

TI  == lif reduces mics of antibiotics against clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == antibiotic resistance is an ever-growing problem yet the development of new antibiotics has slowed to a trickle, giving rise to the use of combination therapy to eradicate infections. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the combined inhibitory effect of lithium fluoride (lif) and commonly used antimicrobials on the growth of the following bacteria: enterococcus faecalis, staphyloccoccus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, and streptococcus pneumoniae. the in vitro activities of ceftazidime, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, streptomycin, erythromycin, amoxicillin, and ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, alone or combined with lif were performed by microdilution method. mics were determined visually following 18-20 h of incubation at 37 degrees c. we observed reduced mics of antibiotics associated with lif ranging from two-fold to sixteen-fold. the strongest decreases of mics observed were for streptomycin and erythromycin associated with lif against acinetobacter baumannii and streptococcus pneumoniae. an eight-fold reduction was recorded for streptomycin against s. pneumoniae whereas an eight-fold and a sixteen-fold reduction were obtained for erythromycin against a. baumannii and s. pneumoniae. this suggests that lif exhibits a synergistic effect with a wide range of antibiotics and is indicative of its potential as an adjuvant in antibiotic therapy.

TI  == bactericidal activity and oral pathogen inactivation by electromagnetic wave irradiation.
AB  == aims: the aim of this work was to clarify the effects of electromagnetic wave irradiation (emwi) on oral bacterial pathogens. methods and results: a gram-negative (porphyromonas gingivalis) or gram-positive (streptococcus mutans,  s. intermedius, enterococcus faecalis) bacterial suspension was irradiated by emw apparatus (500-1000 khz, 5-15 times, 1 s time(-1) ). quantification of survival bacteria by cfu counting revealed that emwi exhibited marked bactericidal activity against all tested bacteria and bactericidal activity at 500 khz increased in an irradiation number-dependent manner. after emwi at 500 khz, scanning electron microscopic observations showed that the chain of s. mutans cells was shortened after 5 irradiations and the outlines of bacterial cells (s.  mutans and p. gingivalis) were unclear after 5-10 irradiations. emwi inhibited the inductive effect of s. mutans on pro-inflammatory cytokine production in human monocytes and this inhibitory effect was comparable with that of heat-killed bacteria. furthermore, using an enzyme activity assay, emwi partially inactivated the activities of gingipains from p. gingivalis. conclusions: these findings demonstrated that emwi has inactivation and bactericidal activities against single microbial species among four kinds of oral pathogens. significance and impact of the study: electromagnetic wave irradiation may be applicable for medical disinfection and sterilization, such as refractory periapical periodontitis.

TI  == the surface lipids of non-tuberculous mycobacteria suppress production of phagocyte activating cytokines in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
AB  == the genus mycobacterium includes obligate pathogens as well as opportunistic and  non-pathogenic species ubiquitous in the environment. mycobacteria have a unique  cell wall abundant in lipids. here we investigated cytokine production by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) in response to the opportunistic mycobacteria mycobacterium avium and mycobacterium abscessus, the non-pathogenic  mycobacterium gordonae and extracted surface lipids from the three species. the cytokine response elicited by mycobacteria, regardless of their pathogenic potential, differed distinctly from that induced by control gram-positive (enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus mitis) and gram-negative (escherichia coli) bacteria. mycobacteria induced no il-12 and less tnf and ifn-gamma compared with  conventional gram-positive bacteria. il-10 was induced by all the mycobacteria and this production was partly responsible for the down-regulation of il-12 and ifn-gamma. the capacity of the gram-positive bacterium e. faecalis to induce il-12, as well as tnf and ifn-gamma, in human pbmcs was strongly reduced when mycobacterial lipids were added. the mycobacterial surface lipids down-regulated  the production of il-12 and ifn-gamma without eliciting il-10 production. our results show that mycobacteria evade triggering production of phagocyte activating cytokines (il-12, tnf and ifn-gamma) and that the mycobacterial cell wall surface lipids may play a significant role in this process.

AB  == aim: chronic cystitis in diaper-dependent elderly patients can be a causative pathology for recurrent urinary tract infections (utis) in community hospitals. methods: we analyzed hospital infections to determine causative organisms from january 2007 to december 2009 in patients in a long-term care hospital. the reading causes of hospital infections were utis (30.4%), aspiration pneumonia (cap; 26%) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (hap; 17.2%). of a total of 3,097 hospital infections over the investigation period, utis were the most common (n=940, 30.4%) followed by cap (n=809, 26%) and hap (n=533, 17.2%). of 278 utis in 2007, the causative strains were escherichia coli (n=106, 38%), enterococcus faecalis (n=44, 16%), proteus mirabilis (n=31, 11%), alpha-hemolytic streptococcus (n=22, 8%), and beta-hemolytic streptococcus (n=14, 5%). extended spectrum beta-lactamase (n=14, 13%) strains were noted in 106 patients with escherichia coli. we then retrospectively examined the records of 110 diaper dependent elderly patients, (medical words, n=52, mix-care wards, n=68) for utis  over the same study period. of these 16 (14.5%) had no utis at any time, 12 (11%) were infected 50% of the time, 17 (15.5%) were infected 51% to 99% of the time and 65 (59%) were infected 100% of the time. the uti rate was not correlated with bladder function or between the 2 wards. we treated bacterial cystitis with antibiotics for 3-5 days but these were unsuccessful. antiseptics worked temporarily, but recurrence or re-infection always occurred. it remains unknown if diapers are a potential cause of chronic cystitis in dependent elderly patients. the clinical dilemma of whether recurrent diaper cystitis should be treated and prohibit the growth and spread of drug-resistant strains, remains challenging.

TI  == antibacterial activity of wine phenolic compounds and oenological extracts against potential respiratory pathogens.
AB  == aims: to investigate the effect of seven wine phenolic compounds and six oenological phenolic extracts on the growth of pathogenic bacteria associated with respiratory diseases (pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, moraxella catarrhalis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sp group f, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus pneumoniae). methods and results: antimicrobial activity was determined using a microdilution method and quantified as ic(50) . mor. catarrhalis was the most susceptible specie to phenolic compounds and extracts. gallic acid and ethyl gallate were the compounds that showed the greatest antimicrobial activity. regarding phenolic extracts, gse (grape seed extract) and gse-o (oligomeric-rich fraction from gse) were the ones  that displayed the strongest antimicrobial effects. conclusions: results highlight the antimicrobial properties of wine phenolic compounds and oenological extracts against potential respiratory pathogens. the antimicrobial activity of wine phenolic compounds was influenced by the type of phenolic compounds. gram-negative bacteria were more susceptible than gram-positive bacteria to the action of phenolic compounds and extracts; however, the effect was species-dependent. significance and impact of study: the ability to inhibit the growth of respiratory pathogenic bacteria as shown by several wine phenolic compounds and oenological extracts warrants further investigations to explore the use of grape and wine preparations in oral hygiene.

TI  == inhibition of candida albicans yeast-hyphal transition and biofilm formation by solidago virgaurea water extracts.
AB  == xerostomia is a decrease of saliva secretion, which can unbalance the oral microflora, mainly to the benefit of candida albicans. the aim of the present study was to find a plant extract that could create an unfavourable environment for candida, and would, therefore, be appropriate for use in a dry-mouth daily-care mouthwash. water extract from the herbaceous plant solidago virgaurea  (goldenrod) was selected due to its saponin content (plant detergents). saponin concentrations reached 0.7 and 0.95 mg ml(-1) in s. virgaurea subsp. virgaurea and s. virgaurea subsp. alpestris extracts, respectively. c. albicans was grown in liquid medium and cells were counted by microscopic examination after 0, 4 and 24 h of incubation. solidago extracts did not inhibit the growth of c. albicans (four strains), escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius or enterococcus faecalis. when inocula were incubated with solidago extract for 4 and 24 h, we observed a decrease in candida yeast-hyphal transition. candida biofilms were then prepared  in microtitre plates and treated with plant extracts at 0 h, to estimate biofilm  formation, or at 18 h to estimate the effect of the saponin on pre-formed biofilms. biofilm formation and pre-formed biofilms were both strongly inhibited. in conclusion, the s. virgaurea extract was efficient against two key virulence factors of c. albicans: the yeast-hyphal transition phase and biofilm formation.

TI  == antibacterial activity of dentine and pulp extracellular matrix extracts.
AB  == aim: to determine whether extracellular matrix (ecm) preparations from pulp (pecm) and dentine (decm) possess antimicrobial activity. methodology: dentine and pulp ecm preparations were isolated with 10% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid  (edta), ph 7.2 and sequential use of 0.5mol l(-1) nacl, ph 11.7 and 0.1mol l(-1)  tartaric acid, ph 2.0, respectively, with protease inhibitor inclusion throughout. antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis and enterococcus faecalis was assessed using turbidity as a measure of bacteria growth. the cytotoxicity of the extracts on primary pulp cells was also  determined by lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) release. statistical analysis of data was performed using paired student's t-tests. results: extracellular matrix extracts from the pulp and dentine showed antibacterial activity against three types of anaerobic bacteria associated with dental disease (p< 0.05). the ecm extracts demonstrated no significant cytotoxic effect on pulpal cells at the concentrations used for antibacterial activity. conclusions: the bacteriostatic antibacterial activity of pecm and decm indicates that the release of these matrix molecules from pulp and dentine may contribute to defence responses during dental disease, treatment and repair.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of mtad and nisin in combination against common pathogens associated with root canal infection.
AB  == introduction: many pathogenic microorganisms were found in an infected root canal. the object of this study was to evaluate the effect of mtad in combination with nisin on the pathogens associated with root canal infection. methods: the survival rates of 9 pathogenic bacteria were determined after 1-, 5-, and 10-minute treatment with mtad, mtan (substitution of doxycycline with nisin), and mtadn (nisin in combination with doxycycline). the survival rates of enterococcus faecalis in the starvation phase and pretreatment alkalization as well as in the  normal physiological state under mtad, mtan, and mtadn challenge for 1, 5, and 10 minutes were evaluated and compared. furthermore, scanning electron microscopy was used to observe the morphologic modification of actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus paracasei, and porphyromonas gingivalis after mtad and mtadn treatment. results: l. fermenti, l. paracasei, a. viscosus, a. naeslundii, streptococcus gordonii, and peptostreptococcus were more sensitive to mtadn and mtan than to mtad. mtad, mtan, and mtadn showed a rapid antibacterial effect on p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum. enterococcus faecalis in the stress state was as sensitive to mtad, mtan, and mtadn as the control e. faecalis. furthermore, in the observation of scanning electron microscopy, the membranes in a. naeslundii and l. paracasei presented significant rupture, and p. gingivalis did not exhibit significant damage after mtadn treatment. conclusions: mtad in combination with nisin improved antibacterial efficacy against pathogens, especially for some gram-positive bacteria associated with persistent intracanal infection. therefore, the combination had the potential to be used as an effective intracanal irrigation.

TI  == microbiological aspects of vulvovaginitis in prepubertal girls.
AB  == this study aimed to establish the vaginal introitus microbial flora in girls with and without symptoms of vulvovaginitis, and to present the distribution of isolated microorganisms by age groups in girls with vulvovaginitis. we enrolled 500 girls with vulvovaginitis symptoms, aged 2-12 years, referred by their pediatricians for microbiological examination of the vaginal introitus swabs, and 30 age-matched asymptomatic girls. similar microbial flora was isolated in both groups, but the symptomatic girls had significantly more common positive microbiological findings compared to controls (p < 0.001). in symptomatic girls,  the following pathogenic bacteria were isolated: streptococcus pyogenes (4.2%), haemophilus influenzae (0.4%), and staphylococcus aureus (5.8%). bacteria of fecal origin were found in vaginal introitus swabs in 33.8% of cases, most commonly proteus mirabilis (14.4%), enterococcus faecalis (12.2%), and escherichia coli (7.0%). the finding of fecal flora was more common compared to controls, reaching a statistical significance (p < 0.05), as well as in girls aged up to 6 years (p < 0.001). candida species were found in 2.4% of girls with  vulvovaginitis symptoms. conclusion: the microbial ecosystem in girls with clinical signs of vulvovaginitis is complex and variable, and the presence of a microorganism does not necessarily imply that it is the cause of infection. the diagnosis of vulvovaginitis in prepubertal girls requires a complex and comprehensive approach, and microbiological findings should be interpreted in the context of clinical findings.

TI  == development of 4h-pyridopyrimidines: a class of selective bacterial protein synthesis inhibitors.
AB  == background: we have identified a series of compounds that inhibit protein synthesis in bacteria. initial ic50's in aminoacylation/translation (a/t) assays  ranged from 3 to14 mum. this series of compounds are variations on a 5,6,7,8-tetrahydropyrido[4,3-d]pyrimidin-4-ol scaffold (e.g., 4h-pyridopyrimidine). methods: greater than 80 analogs were prepared to investigate the structure-activity relationship (sar). structural modifications included changes in the central ring and substituent modifications in its periphery focusing on the 2- and 6-positions. an a/t system was used to determine ic50 values for activity of the analogs in biochemical assays. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) were determined for each analog against cultures of enterococcus faecalis, moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli tolc mutants and e. coli modified with pmbn. results: modifications to the 2-(pyridin-2-yl) ring resulted in complete inactivation of the compounds. however, certain modifications at the 6-position resulted in increased antimicrobial potency. the  optimized compounds inhibited the growth of e. faecalis, m. catarrhalis, h. influenzae, s. pneumoniae, s. aureus, e. coli tolc, mutants and e. coli modified  with pmbn with mic values of 4, </= 0.12, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1 mug/ml, respectively. ic50 values in biochemical assay were reduced to mid-nanomolar range. conclusion: 4h-pyridopyrimidine analogs demonstrate broad-spectrum inhibition of bacterial growth and modification of the compounds establishes sar.

TI  == protection against staphylococcus aureus by antibody to the polyglycerolphosphate backbone of heterologous lipoteichoic acid.
AB  == type 1 lipoteichoic acid (lta) is present in many clinically important gram-positive bacteria, including enterococci, streptococci, and staphylococci, and antibodies against lta have been shown to opsonize nonencapsulated enterococcus faecalis strains. in the present study, we show that antibodies against e. faecalis lta also bind to type 1 lta from other gram-positive species  and opsonized staphylocccus epidermidis and staphylcoccus aureus strains as well  as group b streptococci. inhibition studies using teichoic acid oligomers indicated that cross-reactive opsonic antibodies bind to the teichoic acid backbone. passive immunization with rabbit antibodies against e. faecalis lta promoted the clearance of bacteremia by e. faecalis and s. epidermidis in mice. furthermore, passive protection also reduced mortality in a murine s. aureus peritonitis model. the effectiveness of rabbit antibody against lta suggests that this conserved bacterial structure could function as a single vaccine antigen that targets multiple gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == development of a multispecies biofilm community by four root canal bacteria.
AB  == introduction: the development of multispecies biofilm models are needed to explain the interactions that take place in root canal biofilms during apical periodontitis. the aim of this study was to investigate the ability of 4 root canal bacteria to establish a multispecies biofilm community and to characterize  the main structural, compositional, and physiological features of this community. methods: four clinical isolates isolated from infected root canals, actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus salivarius, streptococcus gordonii, and enterococcus faecalis, were grown together in a miniflow cell system. simultaneous detection of the 4 species in the biofilm communities was achieved by fluorescence in situ  hybridization in combination with confocal microscopy at different time points. the live/dead baclight technique (molecular probes, carlsbad, ca) was used to assess cell viability and to calculate 3-dimensional architectural parameters such as biovolume (mum(3)). redox fluorescence dye 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride was used to assess the metabolic activity of biofilm bacteria. results: the 4 species tested were able to form stable and reproducible biofilm communities. the biofilms formed in rich medium generally showed continuous growth over time, however, in the absence of glucose biofilms showed significantly smaller biovolumes. a high proportion of viable cells (>90%) were generally observed, and biofilm growth was correlated with high metabolic activity of cells. the community structure of biofilms formed in rich medium did  not change considerably over the 120-hour period, during which e. faecalis, l. salivarius, and s. gordonii were most abundant. conclusions: the ability of 4 root canal bacteria to form multispecies biofilm communities shown in this study  give insights into assessing the community lifestyle of these microorganisms in vivo. this multispecies model could be useful for further research simulating stresses representative of in vivo conditions.

TI  == novel bacterial lipoprotein structures conserved in low-gc content gram-positive  bacteria are recognized by toll-like receptor 2.
AB  == bacterial lipoproteins/lipopeptides inducing host innate immune responses are sensed by mammalian toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2). these bacterial lipoproteins are structurally divided into two groups, diacylated or triacylated lipoproteins, by  the absence or presence of an amide-linked fatty acid. the presence of diacylated lipoproteins has been predicted in low-gc content gram-positive bacteria and mycoplasmas based on the absence of one modification enzyme in their genomes; however, we recently determined triacylated structures in low-gc gram-positive staphylococcus aureus, raising questions about the actual lipoprotein structure in other low-gc content gram-positive bacteria. here, through intensive ms analyses, we identified a novel and unique bacterial lipoprotein structure containing an n-acyl-s-monoacyl-glyceryl-cysteine (named the lyso structure) from low-gc gram-positive enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, streptococcus sanguinis, and lactobacillus bulgaricus. two of the purified native lyso-form lipoproteins induced proinflammatory cytokine production from mice macrophages in a tlr2-dependent and tlr1-independent manner but with a different dependence on tlr6. additionally, two other new lipoprotein structures were identified. one is  the "n-acetyl" lipoprotein structure containing n-acetyl-s-diacyl-glyceryl-cysteine, which was found in five gram-positive bacteria, including bacillus subtilis. the n-acetyl lipoproteins induced the proinflammatory cytokines through the tlr2/6 heterodimer. the other was identified in a mycoplasma strain and is an unusual diacyl lipoprotein structure  containing two amino acids before the lipid-modified cysteine residue. taken together, our results suggest the existence of novel tlr2-stimulating lyso and n-acetyl forms of lipoproteins that are conserved in low-gc content gram-positive bacteria and provide clear evidence for the presence of yet to be identified key  enzymes involved in the bacterial lipoprotein biosynthesis.

TI  == broad identification of bacterial type in urinary tract infection using (1)h nmr  spectroscopy.
AB  == to address the shortcomings of urine culture for the rapid identification of urinary tract infection (uti), we applied (1)h-nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectroscopy as a surrogate method for fast screening of microorganisms. study includes 682 urine samples from suspected uti patients, 50 healthy volunteers, and commercially available standard strains of gram negative bacilli (gnb) (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia, enterobacter, acinetobacter, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter frundii) and gram positive cocci (gpc) (enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus group b, staphylococcus saprophyticus). acetate, lactate, ethanol, succinate, creatinine, trimethylamine  (tma), citrate, trimethylamin-n-oxide, glycine, urea, and hippurate were measured by (1)h nmr spectroscopy. all urine specimens were evaluated with culture method. multivariate discriminant function analysis (dfa) reveals that acetate, lactate,  succinate, and formate were able to differentiate, with high accuracy (99.5%), healthy controls from uti patients. this statistical analysis was also able to classify gnb to gpc infected urine samples with high accuracy (96%). this technique appears to be a promising, rapid, and noninvasive approach to probing gnb and gpc infected urine specimens with its distinguishing metabolic profile. the determination of infection will be very important for rapidly and efficiently measuring the efficacy of a tailored treatment, leading to prompt and appropriate care of uti patients.

TI  == vaginal bacterial flora and cytology in proestrous bitches: role on fertility.
AB  == the study of canine vaginal cytology underwent limited evolution over the years.  presence and significance of inflammatory cells in vaginal smears are little considered aspects in the bitch. moreover, occurrence of vaginal bacteria in breeding bitches during follicular phase of the reproductive cycle, in absence of clinical signs of infection, involves the difficult question of antibiotics administration. the aim of this study was to relate findings in vaginal cytology  (presence of neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, erytrocytes and bacteria) and microbial environment during proestrus with fertility outcomes (development of pregnancy, uterine infection, resorption, abortion and neonatal mortality). bacteria sensitivity to antibiotics normally used in small animal practice was also evaluated. bacteria isolated from vagina, in order of frequency, were enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus beta-haemolyticus, pasteurella multocida, e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, e. coli haemolyticus, arcanobacterium pyogenes, streptococcus spp., staphylococcus spp. and acinetobacter spp. no mycoplasmas were observed. the present study showed that proestrous cytological aspects do not affect fertility. eosinophils were never detected, while erythrocytes were always detected. during diestrus, e. coli was found in all pregnant bitches that developed clinical symptoms of uterine disorders (n = 3), resulting in uterine infection, resorption or abortion, but without statistical significance. vaginal presence of streptococcus spp. in proestrus was instead negatively associated with development of uterine infections (p = 0.005). therefore, streptococcus spp. could have a protective competitive role against more dangerous pathogens affecting fertility of the bitch. among the 12 antibiotics tested, gram-negative bacteria showed a significant sensitivity towards the amoxicillin and clavulanic acid association (p = 0.038). however, antibiotic treatment before mating, on the basis of positive culture, yet in the absence of clinical signs, seems to be unnecessary besides harmful leading to imbalance in vaginal commensal flora with adverse effects on fertility. in conclusion, vaginal bacteria, neutrophils, lymphocytes and erytrocytes should be considered as physiological aspect in the bitch during  proestrus that does not require antibiotic therapy when asymptomatic.

AB  == dental caries and pulpal diseases are common oral bacterial infectious diseases.  controlling and reducing the causative pathogens, such as streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis, is a key step toward prevention and treatment of the two diseases. chrysophsin-1 is a cationic antimicrobial peptide having broad-spectrum bactericidal activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. in this study, we investigated the antibacterial activity of chrysophsin-1 against several oral pathogens and s. mutans biofilms and performed a preliminary study of the antimicrobial mechanism. cytotoxic activity of chrysophsin-1 against human gingival fibroblasts (hgfs) was investigated. minimal inhibitory concentration (mic), minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) and time-kill assay were used to evaluate the killing effect of chrysophsin-1. scanning electron microscopy (sem) was used to analyze morphological and membrane change in oral pathogens. live/dead staining, in conjunction with confocal scanning laser microscopy (cslm), was used to observe and analyze s. mutans biofilms. mic and mbc results demonstrated that chrysophsin-1 had different antimicrobial activities against the tested oral microbes. lysis and pore formation of the cytomembrane were observed following treatment of the bacteria with chrysophsin-1 for 4h or 24h by sem. furthermore, clsm images showed that chrysophsin-1 remarkably reduced the viability of cells within biofilms and had a significantly lethal effect against s. mutans biofilms. toxicity studies showed that chrysophsin-1 at concentration between 8 mug/ml and 32 mug/ml had little effect on viability of hgfs in 5 min. our findings suggest that chrysophsin-1 may have potential clinical applications in the prevention and treatment of dental caries and pulpal diseases.

TI  == necrotizing periodontal diseases in hiv-infected brazilian patients: a clinical and microbiologic descriptive study.
AB  == objective: nowadays, necrotizing periodontal diseases have a low prevalence; however, a better understanding of the etiopathogenesis of these diseases is necessary for determining more adequate preventive and therapeutic strategies. method and materials: from a pool of 1,232 hiv-infected patients, 15 presented with necrotizing periodontal diseases, which were evaluated by full-mouth periodontal clinical measurements. subgingival biofilm samples were collected from necrotizing lesions of six of these individuals. the presence and levels of  47 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: all 15 patients (10 had severe immunodeficiency) had been infected sexually. thirteen patients were taking antiretroviral medication (66.7% undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy). regarding necrotizing periodontal diseases, necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (60%) was more prevalent  than necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis (40%). the frequency of supragingival biofilm and bleeding on probing ranged from 11.5% to 59.2% and 3.0% to 54.0%, respectively, whereas the mean probing depth and clinical attachment level were between 1.48 and 2.61 mm and 1.30 and 2.62 mm, respectively. species detected in  high prevalence and/or counts in necrotizing lesions included treponema denticola, eikenella corrodens, dialister pneumosintes, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus intermedius, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and campylobacter rectus. in contrast, parvimonas micra, prevotella melaninogenica, fusobacterium nucleatum, eubacterium nodatum, and helicobacter pylori were observed in the lowest mean prevalence and/or counts. conclusion: necrotizing periodontal disease lesions in hiv-infected patients present a microbiota with high prevalence and/or counts of classical periodontal pathogens, in particular t denticola, as well as species not commonly considered as periodontal pathogens, such as e faecalis and d pneumosintes. in addition, these individuals with necrotizing periodontal disease frequently display severe immunodeficiency and aids-defining diseases such as tuberculosis.

TI  == endocarditis in a large district general hospital: a study of the microbiological spectrum between 2000 and 2011.
AB  == infective endocarditis is one of three common cardiac infections in the united kingdom, in addition to myocarditis and pericarditis, with a reported incidence of 1.7 to 6.2 cases per 100,000 patient years. infective endocarditis can often have serious consequences and a wide variety of organisms may be the causative pathogen. there are little published data regarding the exact spectrum of organisms that cause endocarditis in the united kingdom and whether organisms such as streptococci still dominate. in the present study, all cases of endocarditis at the authors' institution, representing a typical nontertiary centre, were retrospectively examined and audited to provide a snapshot of the organism spectrum in these patients. the cases of more than 120 patients who were coded as having endocarditis by the institution's clinical coding department during the period between december 2000 and january 2011 were examined. microbiological tests and clinical case notes of all patients were reviewed. of the 101 patients diagnosed with and treated for endocarditis, 64 were male, with  a mean age of 60.57 years. the most common organisms identified were streptococcus species (31%), staphylococcus aureus (27%) and enterococcus faecalis (21%). the organisms with the highest associated mortality rate were s aureus and the 'other organism' group, which included non-hacek group (haemophilus species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, cardiobacterium hominis, eikenella corrodens and kingella species) pathogens such as candida albicans. streptococcus species and s aureus remain the main cause of endocarditis in a typical hospital setting in the united kingdom, although in a smaller proportion of cases than historical data suggests. overall, mortality remains high, and the clinician should remain vigilant to endocarditis in any patient with a positive blood culture because the number of cases of endocarditis caused by less typical organisms are increasing.

TI  == salivary iga antibody responses to streptococcus mitis and streptococcus mutans in preterm and fullterm newborn children.
AB  == objectives: the intensities and specificities of salivary iga antibody responses  to antigens of streptococcus mutans, the main pathogen of dental caries, may influence colonization by these organisms during the first 1.5 year of life. thus, the ontogeny of salivary iga responses to oral colonizers continues to warrant investigation, especially with regard to the influence of birth conditions, e.g. prematurity, on the ability of children to efficiently respond to oral microorganisms. in this study, we characterised the salivary antibody responses to two bacterial species which are prototypes of pioneer and pathogenic microorganisms of the oral cavity (streptococcus mitis and streptococcus mutans,  respectively) in fullterm (ft) and preterm (pt) newborn children. methods: salivas from 123 infants (70 ft and 53 pt) were collected during the first 10h after birth and levels of iga and igm antibodies and the presence of s. mutans and s. mitis were analysed respectively by elisa and by chequerboard dna-dna hybridization. two subgroups of 24 ft and 24 pt children were compared with respect to patterns of antibody specificities against s. mutans and s. mitis antigens, using western blot assays. cross-adsorption of 10 infant's saliva was tested to s. mitis, s. mutans and enterococcus faecalis antigens. results: salivary levels of iga at birth were 2.5-fold higher in ft than in pt children (mann-whitney; p<0.05). salivary iga antibodies reactive with several antigens of s. mitis and s. mutans were detected at birth in children with undetectable levels of those bacteria. adsorption of infant saliva with cells of s. mutans produced a reduction of antibodies recognizing s. mitis antigens in half of the neonates. the diversity and intensity of iga responses were lower in pt compared  to ft children, although those differences were not significant. conclusion: these data provide evidence that children have salivary iga antibodies shortly after birth, which might influence the establishment of the oral microbiota, and  that the levels of salivary antibody might be related to prematurity.

AB  == the results comparison is made between pcr polymerase chain reaction techniques in real-time mode and cultural techniques of analysis of blood samples in patients with suspicion of bacteriemia during early postoperational period. from  september to december 2009 43 blood samples from 37 adult patients aged 59+9.2 years were analyzed on suspicion of bacteriemia. the blood samples for pcr analysis (septifast technique roche diagnostics, switzerland) were taken parallel to the inoculation. among 43 samples 20 (46.5%) were positive. the species structure of identified germs was as follows: enteroccocus faecalis - 2, klebsiella pneumonia - 2, enteroccocusfaecium - 1, pseudomonas aeruginosa - 2, coagulase negative staphilococcus - 11. all cases of seeding of coagulase negative staphilococcus were interpreted using pcr techniques as negative or contamination. in four cases a full matching of results of compared techniques was obtained. in cases when hemoculture was negative (n = 23) the pcr techniques  permitted to detect two positive results (staphilococcus spp. and stenotrophomonas maltophilia). in three cases of positive hemoculture the pcr techniques brought negative result and at that in two cases the causative agents  (pseudomonas fluorescens and ralstonia mannitolilytica) were out of specter of pathogens detected by this method. the pcr techniques in real-time mode permit to reduce significantly time of pathogen investigation and to detect the false positive results conditioned by contamination. this techniques has to be applied  in parallel with cultural technique because only this approach provide a possibility to get the clinically needed data related to the sensitivity of causative agent to antibacterial preparations.

TI  == vancomycin tolerance in gram-positive cocci.
AB  == vancomycin, a glycopeptide antimicrobial agent, represents the last line of defence against a wide range of multi-resistant gram-positive pathogens such as enterococci, staphylococci and streptococci. however, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and staphylococci, along with vancomycin-tolerant clinical isolates,  are compromising the therapeutic efficacy of vancomycin. it is conceivable that tolerance may emerge during prolonged vancomycin use. it has not been until recently, however, that the molecular basis of this tolerance began to be understood. superoxide anions might be involved in the bactericidal activity of vancomycin in enterococci, and recent evidence suggests that the stringent response is partly responsible for vancomycin tolerance in enterococcus faecalis. the mechanism of vancomycin tolerance in staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus  pneumoniae is sometimes associated with a reduction of autolysin activity. vancomycin tolerance in s. aureus and s. pneumoniae also appears to be somehow related with the two-component regulatory systems linked to cell envelope stress, although the precise molecular regulatory pathways remain poorly defined.

TI  == enterococcus faecium wb2000 inhibits biofilm formation by oral cariogenic streptococci.
AB  == this study investigated the inhibitory effect of probiotic enterococcus faecium wb2000 on biofilm formation by cariogenic streptococci. the ability of e. faecium wb2000 and jcm5804 and enterococcus faecalis jcm5803 to inhibit biofilm formation by seven laboratory oral streptococcal strains and 13 clinical mutans streptococcal strains was assayed. the enterococcal strains inhibited biofilm formation in dual cultures with the mutans streptococcal strains streptococcus mutans xc and streptococcus sobrinus jcm5176 (p < 0.05), but not with the noncariogenic streptococcal strains. enterococcus faecium wb2000 inhibited biofilm formation by 90.0% (9/10) of the clinical s. mutans strains and 100% (3/3) of the clinical s. sobrinus strains. after culturing, the ph did not differ between single and dual cultures. the viable counts of floating mutans streptococci were lower in dual cultures with e. faecium wb2000 than in single cultures. enterococcus faecium wb2000 acted as a probiotic bacterial inhibitor of cariogenic streptococcal biofilm formation.

TI  == microbiological findings in endometrial specimen: our experience.
AB  == purpose: collection of an endometrial specimen for investigating infectious agents in the endometrial cavity is an invasive technique that is at times difficult and painful. in order to avoid the need for endometrial sampling in the cases of suspected or evident endometrial pathology, the aim of this study is to  investigate the reliability of cervical cultures for detecting infectious agents  present at the endometrial level, comparing the results between cervical cultures and endometrial cultures in women with clinical signs of endometrial inflammation. methods: in a prospective diagnostic study, in the period from january 2009 to october 2010, we enrolled 404 women referred to the department of obstetrics and gynecology for diagnostic hysteroscopy. all the patients underwent cervical and endometrial sampling. cultures for common bacteria, neisseria gonorrhoeae, yeast, and ureaplasma urealyticum were performed. results: the most  frequent infectious agents detected at the endometrial level were common bacteria, which accounted for 69% of all cases. in particular, streptococci were  found in 27% of cases, and bacteria from intestinal flora (enterococcus faecalis  and escherichia coli) was recovered in 31% of cases. u. urealyticum was detected  in 10% and mycoplasma in only one patient (0.2% of cases). no cases of n. gonorrhoeae were found. conclusions: cervical culture has a low concordance with  endometrial culture. in fact in only 33% of cases was the microorganism found in  the cervix the same as that found in the endometrium. these results infer that an endometrial culture is a useful investigative tool for determining the microorganisms in endometrial pathology.

TI  == extracellular dna in biofilms.
AB  == extracellular dna (edna) is an important biofilm component that was recently discovered. its presence has been initially observed in biofilms of pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mutans, then enterococcus faecalis and staphylococci. autolysis is the common mechanism by which edna is released. in p. aeruginosa edna is generated by lysis of a bacterial subpopulation, under control of quorum sensing system. in e. faecalis autolysis proceeds in a fratricide mode, resulting from a process similar to necrosis of eukaryotic cells. in staphylococcus aureus autolysis originates by an altruistic  suicide, i.e., a programmed cell death similar to apoptosis of eukaryotic cells.  in s. aureus autolysis is mediated by murein hydrolase, while in s. epidermidis by the autolysin protein atle. in p. aeruginosa edna is located primarily in the  stalks of mushroom-shaped multicellular structures. in s. aureus the crucial role of edna in stabilizing biofilm is highlighted by the disgregating effect of dnase i. edna represents an important mechanism for horizontal gene transfer in bacteria. edna and other microbial structural motifs are recognized by the innate immune system via the tlr family of pattern recognition receptors (prrs).

TI  == identification of lactobacilli residing in chicken ceca with antagonism against campylobacter.
AB  == bacteriocins produced by lactobacillus salivarius have been recently recognized as a natural means to control campylobacter and salmonella in live poultry. this  finding is of relevance since campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli are the predominant species isolated from poultry that are associated with human campylobacteriosis. in the present work, lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from the cecum of twenty tunisian chickens were identified and those isolates with antagonism against campylobacter were further characterized. following their preliminary confirmation as lab, 150 strains were identified by combining morphological criteria, biochemical tests, and molecular methods, the latter inluding intergenic 16s- 23s pcr, specific lactobacilli pcr, and a biphasic approach. most of the lab isolated belonged to the genus lactobacillus, among them lb. sakei (33.3%), lb. salivarius (19.4%), lb. reuteri (8.6%), and lb. curvatus (8.6%). the other lab strains included those of the genus weissella (16.7%), enterococcus faecalis (5.3%), leuconostoc mesenteroides (2.7%), lactococcus graviae (2.7%), and streptococcus sp. (2.7%). the lactobacilli strains were tested for their antagonism against c. jejuni and c. coli. the activity of three of them, lb. salivarius smxd51, lb. salivarius mms122, and lb.  salivarius mms151, against the aforementioned target strains could be ascribed to the production of bacteriocins.

TI  == synergistic effect of thermal energy on bactericidal action of photolysis of h(2)o(2) in relation to acceleration of hydroxyl radical generation.
AB  == the purpose of the present study is to evaluate the effect of thermal energy on the yield of and the bactericidal action of hydroxyl radical generated by photolysis of h(2)o(2). different concentrations of h(2)o(2) (250, 500, 750, and  1,000 mm) were irradiated with light-emitting diodes (leds) at a wavelength of 400 +/- 20 nm at 25 degrees c to generate hydroxyl radical. the 500 mm h(2)o(2) was irradiated with the leds at different temperatures (25, 35, 45, and 55 degrees c). electron spin resonance spin trapping analysis showed that the yield  of hydroxyl radicals increased with the temperature, as well as the concentration of h(2)o(2). streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis were used in the bactericidal assay. the led-light irradiation of the bacterial suspensions in 500 mm h(2)o(2) at 25 degrees c could hardly kill the bacteria within 3 min, while the bactericidal effect was markedly enhanced with the temperature rise. for instance, a temperature increase to 55 degrees c resulted in >99.999% reduction of viable counts of both bacterial species only within 1 min. the photolysis of 500 mm h(2)o(2) at 55 degrees c could reduce the viable counts of bacteria more efficiently than did the photolysis of 1,000 mm h(2)o(2) at 25 degrees c, although the yields of hydroxyl radical were almost the same under the both conditions. these findings suggest that the thermal energy accelerates the generation of hydroxyl radical by photolysis of h(2)o(2), which in turn results in a synergistic bactericidal effect of hydroxyl radical and thermal energy.

TI  == bacterial and candida albicans adhesion on different root canal filling materials and sealers.
AB  == introduction: microbial adhesion and subsequent biofilm formation on endodontic root canal filling materials and sealers lead to survival of microorganisms in treated root canals and subsequently to endodontic treatment failures. the present study focused on initial microbial adhesion to different endodontic filling materials. methods: the following endodontic biomaterials were tested: ah-plus, tubli seal, gutta-percha, real seal se, endorez, apexit plus, guttaflow, and dentin. samples of each material were prepared. bovine dentin samples were used as a control. the initial adhesions of salivary bacteria as well as the subsequent single species were quantified by determination of colony-forming units (cfus) and visualized by scanning electron microscopy and confocal microscopy (clsm): enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, candida albicans, and prevotella nigrescens. results: initially adherent microorganisms could be detected and microscopically visualized on each of the materials tested. considering the values of the cfus and the covering grade as detected by clsm, there were significant differences among the materials. fewer bacteria tended to adhere to apexit plus, whereas real seal se and the widely used gutta-percha showed the highest number of adherent bacteria. this tendency was not detected for c. albicans. conclusions: endodontic microorganisms have a high affinity to root canal filling materials and sealers, especially to gutta-percha. because of this high level of bacterial adhesion, subsequent biofilm formation on these materials could be suggested as leading to the persistence of microorganisms in root canals.

TI  == synthesis, antimicrobial activity and possible mechanism of action of 9-bromo-substituted indolizinoquinoline-5,12-dione derivatives.
AB  == a series of 9-bromo-substituted indolizinoquinoline-5,12-dione derivatives was synthesized. antimicrobial activity assessment indicates that compounds 1, 26, 27 and 28 exhibit strong activity against gram-positive bacterial strains, including beta-hemolytic streptococcus cmcc32210, staphylococcus aureus atcc25923, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc12228, enterococcus faecalis atcc29212 and methicillin-resistant s. aureus atcc43300 (mrsa). compound 27 shows the best anti-mrsa activity with an mic value of 0.031 mug/ml. to assess the mechanism of  action, the inhibitory activities of compound 1 against dna gyrase and dna topoisomerase iv were also measured. the results indicate that compound 1 has strong inhibitory effects on the escherichia coli dna gyrase supercoiling activity and s. aureus topo iv relaxing activity.

TI  == microbiology at first visit of moderate-to-severe diabetic foot infection with antimicrobial activity and a survey of quinolone monotherapy.
AB  == samples from 1295 patients with diabetic foot infection were evaluated; 4332 samples were collected with an average of 3.3 samples per patient. fifty-seven percent of patients had a 2b ulcer and 23% had a 3b ulcer according to texas university classification. in 64.2% of samples collected at first visit an etiologic agent was identified. about 40% of the positive samples were polymicrobial. gram positive bacteria were more frequently isolated (52.6%), staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated single agent (29.9%) and mrsa was 22% of s. aureus. enterococcus spp., mainly enterococcus faecalis, were  9.9%, all vancomycin susceptible except 2 isolates. streptococci were 4.6%, more  than 60% streptococcus agalactiae. gram negative rods were 40.6%, with enterobacteria 23.5% and pseudomonas aeruginosa 10.3%. anaerobes were only 0.3%,  probably due to culture methods applied in our laboratory. cotrimoxazole, rifampin and doxycycline were still active against s. aureus. esbl producers, among enterobacteria, were 10%, mainly escherichia coli and proteus spp. only colistin had a rate of susceptibility against p. aeruginosa above 90%. levofloxacin had the best clinical activity with respect to the other quinolones, but when it failed, selected more resistant strains with respect to moxifloxacin  among s. aureus and with respect to ciprofloxacin among p. aeruginosa.

AB  == aims: to report the incidence of infectious and noninfectious endophthalmitis after intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) from a multicenter clinical trial in japan. methods: a retrospective multicenter  review of the data of patients who received intravitreal anti-vegf injections between january 2007 and march 2011 was undertaken. cases with the clinical diagnosis of endophthalmitis resulting from intravitreal injection were identified and reviewed. results: a total of 5,236 intravitreal anti-vegf injections (1,209 intravitreal injections of bevacizumab, 3,827 injections of ranibizumab, and 200 injections of pegaptanib sodium) had been administered. five patients (0.095%), all of whom had received bevacizumab, were diagnosed as having endophthalmitis after the intravitreal injection. all patients visited the institutes for re-examination within 1-2 days after the injection. among the 5 patients, 2 (0.038%) were culture positive for streptococcus oralis and enterococcus faecalis, respectively. the remaining 3 eyes (0.057%) developed presumed noninfectious endophthalmitis. conclusion: although endophthalmitis is a rare complication associated with intravitreal injection, in this series intravitreal anti-vegf injection caused infectious or noninfectious endophthalmitis at a relatively high frequency. further investigations are needed to consider an appropriate injection protocol for minimizing the incidence rates  of endophthalmitis, and to assess the optimal treatment protocol for intravitreal injection-related endophthalmitis although it was difficult to differentiate these two entities.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of daptomycin tested against gram-positive strains collected in european hospitals: results from 7 years of resistance surveillance  (2003-2009).
AB  == daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide approved by the european medicines agency (emea) for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cssti) and staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and endocarditis. we evaluated the in vitro  activity of daptomycin and comparators tested against clinical isolates from european hospitals over a 7-year period (2003-2009). a total of 36,769 consecutive isolates were collected in 34 medical centers located in 13 european  countries, turkey and israel. the collection included s. aureus (18,352; 27.2% oxacillin-resistant [mrsa]); coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons; 6,874), enterococcus spp. (7,241; 9.4% vancomycin-resistant), beta-hemolytic (3,009), viridans group streptococci (1,176), and streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus (107).  the organisms were isolated mainly from patients with bloodstream infection (56%) or cssti (23%). daptomycin was very active against s. aureus and cons (mic(50/90), 0.25/0.5 mg/l for both organisms), and its activity was not adversely influenced by oxacillin resistance. all enterococcus faecalis strains were susceptible to daptomycin (mic(50/90), 1/1 mg/l). daptomycin (mic(50/90), 2/2 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible) and linezolid (mic(50/90), 1/2 mg/l; 99.7% susceptible) were the most active agents tested against vancomycin-resistant e. faecium. vancomycin- resistant and -susceptible enterococcal strains were equally susceptible to daptomycin. daptomycin was also active against beta-hemolytic streptococci (mic(50/90), 0.06/0.25 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible), viridans group streptococci (mic(50/90), 0.25/0.5 mg/l; 99.8% susceptible) and s. bovis (mic(50/90), 0.06/0.12 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible).in summary, daptomycin was very  potent against this large collection (36,769) of gram-positive organisms isolated in european hospitals, and its activity remained stable across the 7-year period  evaluated (2003-2009), using reference methods and interpretive criteria. decreases in daptomycin potency were not observed since emea approval and widespread clinical use, and emerging resistance to other compounds did not adversely influence daptomycin activity against contemporary gram-positive species.

TI  == synergistic and antagonistic effect of lactic acid bacteria on tyramine production by food-borne pathogenic bacteria in tyrosine decarboxylase broth.
AB  == the effect of lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains on tyramine (tyr) and also other biogenic amines (ba) production by eight common food-borne pathogen (fbp) in tyrosine decarboxylase broth (tdb) was investigated by using a rapid hplc method. significant differences were observed among the fbp strains in ammonia (amn) and  ba production apart from tryptamine, histamine (his) and spermine formation (p<0.05). salmonella paratyphi a was characterised as the main amine producer. lab had an important synergetic role in some ba production by food-borne pathogenic bacteria, although the effect of some lab strains on ba production was strain-dependent. lactococcus spp. and streptococcus spp. resulted in significantly higher tyr accumulation by aeromonas hydrophila and enterococcus faecalis in tdb. the presence of lactococcus and/or lactobacillus in tdb significantly increased his production by a. hydrophila, escherichia coli, ent. faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, whereas his accumulation was significantly reduced by staphylococcus aureus, s. paratyphi a and listeria monocytogenes.

TI  == persistent, toxin-antitoxin system-independent, tetracycline resistance-encoding  plasmid from a dairy enterococcus faecium isolate.
AB  == a tetracycline-resistant (tet(r)) dairy enterococcus faecium isolate designated m7m2 was found to carry both tet(m) and tet(l) genes on a 19.6-kb plasmid. after  consecutive transfer in the absence of tetracycline, the resistance-encoding plasmid persisted in 99% of the progenies. dna sequence analysis revealed that the 19.6-kb plasmid contained 28 open reading frames (orfs), including a tet(m)-tet(l)-mob gene cluster, as well as a 10.6-kb backbone highly homologous (99.9%) to the reported plasmid pre25, but without an identified toxin-antitoxin  (ta) plasmid stabilization system. the derived backbone plasmid without the tet(r) determinants exhibited a 100% retention rate in the presence of acridine orange, suggesting the presence of a ta-independent plasmid stabilization mechanism, with its impact on the persistence of a broad spectrum of resistance-encoding traits still to be elucidated. the tet(m)-tet(l) gene cluster from m7m2 was functional and transmissible and led to acquired resistance in enterococcus faecalis og1rf by electroporation and in streptococcus mutans ua159  by natural transformation. southern hybridization showed that both the tet(m) and tet(l) genes were integrated into the chromosome of s. mutans ua159, while the whole plasmid was transferred to and retained in e. faecalis og1rf. quantitative  real-time reverse transcription-pcr (rt-pcr) indicated tetracycline-induced transcription of both the tet(m) and tet(l) genes of pm7m2. the results indicated that multiple mechanisms might have contributed to the persistence of antibiotic  resistance-encoding genes and that the plasmids pm7m2, pip816, and pre25 are likely correlated evolutionarily.

TI  == high-level fluorescence labeling of gram-positive pathogens.
AB  == fluorescence labeling of bacterial pathogens has a broad range of interesting applications including the observation of living bacteria within host cells. we constructed a novel vector based on the e. coli streptococcal shuttle plasmid pat28 that can propagate in numerous bacterial species from different genera. the plasmid harbors a promoterless copy of the green fluorescent variant gene egfp under the control of the camp-factor gene (cfb) promoter of streptococcus agalactiae and was designated pbsu101. upon transfer of the plasmid into streptococci, the bacteria show a distinct and easily detectable fluorescence using a standard fluorescence microscope and quantification by facs-analysis demonstrated values that were 10-50 times increased over the respective controls. to assess the suitability of the construct for high efficiency fluorescence labeling in different gram-positive pathogens, numerous species were transformed. we successfully labeled streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus anginosus and staphylococcus aureus strains utilizing the egfp reporter plasmid pbsu101. in all of these species the presence of the cfb promoter construct resulted in high-level egfp expression that could be further increased by growing the streptococcal and enterococcal cultures under high oxygen conditions through continuous aeration.

TI  == validation of the zurich burn-biofilm model.
AB  == background: despite advances in the use of topical and parenteral antimicrobial therapy and the practice of early tangential burn-wound excision, bacterial infection remains a major problem in the management of burn victims today. the purpose of this study was to design and evaluate a polyspecies biofilm model with bacteria known to cause severe infections in burn patients. the model is simple to prepare, maintain and analyse, and allows for short-term exposure to antimicrobials. results: initial experiments showed that it was impossible to establish balanced polyspecies biofilms with an inoculum of gram-positive and -negative bacteria. after 64.5 h of incubation, the gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) had suppressed the gram-positives (enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus intermedius). however, adding the gram-negative bacteria after 41.5 h to an established biofilm of gram-positives resulted in a balanced microbial consortium. after 64.5 h, all  species were present in high numbers (10(7) to 10(8) colony forming units (cfu) per biofilm). multiple repetitions showed high reproducibility of biofilm formation without significant differences between and within experiments. combined fluorescence in situ hybridisation/confocal laser scanning microscopy (fish/clsm) analyses, for which biofilms had to be grown on a different non-flexible substrate (hydroxy apatite), revealed that, by 41.5 h, the biofilm consisted of an almost confluent layer of bacteria firmly adherent to the substratum. after 64.5 h (22 h after the addition of the gram negatives), the biofilm consisted of a confluent mixture of single cells, an abundance of galaxies of bacteria with small lacunae and large amounts of extracellular matrix polysaccharides. conclusions: the polyspecies biofilm model contains the most prevalent burn-associated gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens and mimics the gram-negative shift observed in vivo. it shows excellent reproducibility. it should allow adaptation to the bacterial spectrum prevalent in different burn centres and lead to a much more reliable investigation of the efficiency of topical antimicrobial agents than models operating with planktonic  bacteria. the experiments further open up the perspective to create an in vivo model using these biofilms as infectious agents.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in mongolia.
AB  == spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. the objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in mongolia. the lab counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/ml. fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of lab, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. in total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de man, rogosa, and sharpe agar and m17 agar. each isolate was considered to be presumptive lab based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16s rrna gene sequencing,  multiplex pcr assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. all isolates from mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), enterococcus durans (3 strains), lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), lactobacillus casei (16 strains), lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and weissella cibaria (1 strain). the predominant lab were strep. thermophilus and lb. helveticus, which were isolated  from all sampling sites. the results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of mongolia have complex compositions of lab species. such diversity of lab provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.

TI  == population biology of gram-positive pathogens: high-risk clones for dissemination of antibiotic resistance.
AB  == infections caused by multiresistant gram-positive bacteria represent a major health burden in the community as well as in hospitalized patients. staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium are well-known pathogens of hospitalized patients, frequently linked with resistance  against multiple antibiotics, compromising effective therapy. streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes are important pathogens in the community and s. aureus has recently emerged as an important community-acquired pathogen. population genetic studies reveal that recombination prevails as a driving force  of genetic diversity in e. faecium, e. faecalis, s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes, and thus, these species are weakly clonal. although recombination has a relatively modest role driving the genetic variation of the core genome of s. aureus, the horizontal acquisition of resistance and virulence genes plays a key  role in the emergence of new clinically relevant clones in this species. in this  review, we discuss the population genetics of e. faecium, e. faecalis, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and s. aureus. knowledge of the population structure of these pathogens is not only highly relevant for (molecular) epidemiological research but also for identifying the genetic variation that underlies changes in clinical behaviour, to improve our understanding of the pathogenic behaviour of particular clones and to identify novel targets for vaccines or immunotherapy.

TI  == tn916-like genetic elements: a diverse group of modular mobile elements conferring antibiotic resistance.
AB  == antibiotic-resistant gram-positive bacteria are responsible for morbidity and mortality in healthcare environments. enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae can all exhibit clinically relevant multidrug resistance phenotypes due to acquired resistance genes on mobile genetic elements. it is possible that clinically relevant multidrug-resistant clostridium difficile strains will appear in the future, as the organism is adept at acquiring mobile genetic elements (plasmids and transposons). conjugative transposons of the tn916/tn1545 family, which carry major antibiotic resistance determinants, are transmissible between these different bacteria by a conjugative mechanism during which the elements are excised by a staggered cut from donor cells, converted to a circular form, transferred by cell-cell contact and inserted into recipient cells by a site-specific recombinase. the ability of these conjugative transposons to acquire additional, clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes importantly contributes to the emergence of multidrug resistance.

AB  == the rapidly evolving crisis of antibiotic resistance among microorganisms has contributed to the rise of patient morbidity and mortality from nosocomial and community-acquired infections. therefore, innovative antimicrobial technology targeting mechanisms to which the bacteria are unlikely to evolve resistance is urgently needed. we have previously described a nitric oxide-releasing nanoparticle (no-np) with efficacy against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and acinetobacter baumannii in vitro and in murine wound and abscess models. although the prior findings suggest that the no-np can be a useful therapeutic for skin and soft tissue infections, the antimicrobial spectrum of no-np has yet to be fully elucidated. in the current study, we investigated the efficacy of a no-np against several gram-positive and -negative  clinical isolates. we found that the no-np were uniformly active against all of the streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates examined, including strains that were both sensitive and resistant to commonly used antibiotics. we concluded that the no-np have the potential to serve as a novel broad spectrum antimicrobial agent.

AB  == mx-2401 is an expanded-spectrum lipopeptide antibiotic selective for gram-positive bacteria that is a semisynthetic analog of the naturally occurring  lipopeptide amphomycin. it was active against enterococcus spp., including vancomycin-sensitive enterococcus (vse), vana-, vanb-, and vanc-positive vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre), linezolid- and quinupristin-dalfopristin-resistant isolates (mic(90) of 4 mug/ml), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and methicillin-sensitive s. aureus (mssa) (mic(90) of 2 mug/ml), coagulase-negative staphylococci, including  methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus epidermidis (msse) and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis (mrse) (mic(90) of 2 mug/ml), and streptococcus spp. including viridans group streptococci, and penicillin-resistant, penicillin-sensitive, penicillin-intermediate and macrolide-resistant isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) of 2 mug/ml). mx-2401 demonstrated a dose-dependent postantibiotic effect varying from 1.5 to 2.4 h. furthermore, mx-2401 was rapidly bactericidal at 4 times the mic against s. aureus and enterococcus faecalis, with more than 99.9% reduction in viable bacterial attained at 4 and 24 h, respectively. the mics of mx-2401 against mrsa, mssa, vse, and vre strains serially exposed for 15 passages to sub- to supra-mics of mx-2401 remained within three dilutions of the original mic. in contrast to that of the lipopeptide daptomycin, the antibacterial activity of mx-2401 was not affected in vitro by the presence of lung surfactant, and mx-2401 was active in vivo in the bronchial-alveolar pneumonia mouse model, in which daptomycin failed to show any  activity. moreover, the activity of mx-2401 was not as strongly dependent on the  ca(2+) concentration as is the activity of daptomycin. in conclusion, mx-2401 is  a promising new-generation lipopeptide for the treatment of serious infections with gram-positive bacteria, including hospital-acquired pneumonia.

TI  == [trends of antimicrobial resistance in microbial strains isolated from invasive infections in romania. experience of participation in earss (european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system), 2002-2008].
AB  == earss (european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system) is the biggest antimicrobial resistance surveillance project in the world financed from public finds, aiming to provide validated and comparable official data on antimicrobial  resistance of invasive microbial strains (isolated from blood and csf), belonging to 6 indicator bacterial species, i.e.: s. aureus, e. coli, e. faecium/faecalis,  str. pneumoniae, ps. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae. romania reported data to earss since 2002 so far. though the number of participating laboratories increased progressively from 12 to 35, the number of hospitals which reported for earss. as the number of strains included in the data base remained steady and relatively low. this issue is related to the particular position of romania in the european  context, in respect of the very low number of blood cultures performed in hospitals. our paper is presenting the trends of antimicrobial resistance in the  indicator strains in the 2002-2008 interval. during the 2002-2008 interval, romania reported to earss a total number of 1276 bacterial strains, distributed by species as follows: 513 s aureus, 369 e. coli, 128 streptococcus pneumoniae, 127 enterococcus spp.. 71 klebsiella pneumoniae, 68 pseudomonas aeruginosa. klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were reported, according to the  earss protocol, only for the 2005-2008 interval. it is difficult to describe trends, specially in enterococcus, streptococcus pneumonaie and the 2 species collected only since 2005, because of the low number of isolates, but there are several results that are supporting us to claim that antimicrobial resistance in  invasive isolates is a real problem in romanian hospitals, like in other central, southern and south eastern european countries: more than 25% of s. aureus strains resistant to methicilline, with more than 50% in some years, high aminoglycozides resistance in more than 70-80% of enterococcus faecium invasive strains, more than 80% of strains resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporines etc.

TI  == n-benzyl-3-sulfonamidopyrrolidines are a new class of bacterial dna gyrase inhibitors.
AB  == this paper characterizes n-benzyl-3-sulfonamidopyrrolidines (gyramides) as dna gyrase inhibitors. gyramide a was previously shown to exhibit antimicrobial activity that suggested it inhibited bacterial cell division. in this study, we conducted target identification studies and identified dna gyrase as the primary  target of gyramide a. the gyramide a resistance-determining region in dna gyrase  is adjacent to the dna cleavage gate and is a new site for inhibitor design. we studied the antibiotic effects of gyramides a-c in combination with the gram-negative efflux pump inhibitor mc-207,110 (60 mum). the gyramides had a minimum inhibitory concentration of 10-40 mum against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pneumoniae; the compounds were ineffective against enterococcus faecalis. the ic(50) of gyramides a-c against e. coli dna gyrase was 0.7- 3.3 mum. the n-benzyl-3-sulfonamidopyrrolidines described in this manuscript represent a starting point for development of antibiotics that bind a new site in dna gyrase.

TI  == antimicrobial effectiveness of different preparations of calcium hydroxide.
AB  == background: intracanal medicaments have an antibacterial effect on the root canal flora. the effectiveness of such vehicles has to be tested and substantiated against the normal bacterial flora. the various vehicles that were tested for their effectiveness were commercially prepared calcium hydroxide (metapex), saline, glycerine, cmcp, and rexidine-m gel. the bacterial cultures tested for sensitivity were aerobes (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus viridans, streptococcus pyogens, enterococcus faecalis), anaerobes (lactobacillus, bacteroides melaninogenicus) and a commonly found fungus (candida albicans). one  hundred and twenty-five samples were divided into five experimental groups consisting of 21 samples each and one control group of the same size. aim: the aim of this study was to investigate in vitro the influence of four different vehicles on the effectiveness of calcium hydroxide against the commonly found aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in endodontic infections. materials and methods: the samples were taken and transported using standardized techniques and pure growth of each bacterium was isolated. petri dishes were prepared for the various calcium hydroxide combinations for each bacterium and incubated. the inhibition zone was recorded at three intervals of 24, 96 and 168 hours. results were tabulated and sent for statistical analysis. results and conclusions: it was seen that calcium hydroxide and cmcp combination showed the maximum zone of inhibition, and maximum inhibitory effect was seen at 24 hours. the bacteria most susceptible was found to be s. aureus and the least susceptible was e. faecalis.  further clinical studies are required to substantiate these results.

TI  == microflora in maxillofacial infections--a changing scenario?
AB  == purpose: advances in isolation and culturing techniques have brought the role of  anaerobic bacteria-causing maxillofacial infections to the fore. recent literature also favors the role of anaerobes in maxillofacial infections. a prospective clinical and microbiological study was designed to check the validity of such claims. patients and methods: this study included 88 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. pus was obtained by aspirating the involved spaces and culture and sensitivity tests were performed to determine the microbes involved and their sensitivity to various antibiotics. results: upon isolating the various organisms causing infection, it was found that 68.2% were aerobes, 13.6% were mixed infections, and 9.1% were anaerobes. streptococcus and peptostreptococcus species were the most common among aerobes and anaerobes, respectively. on determining sensitivity to penicillin, 81.3% were sensitive and  18.8% were resistant. coagulase-negative staphylococcus and staphylococcus aureus were predominantly resistant to penicillin. conclusion: analysis of the results indicated no change in microflora-causing infections in the maxillofacial region  and penicillin remains the drug of choice in treating these infections.

TI  == evaluating the in-vitro antibacterial effect of iranian propolis on oral microorganisms.
AB  == propolis has traditionally been used in curing infections and healing wounds and  burns. current researches have shown that propolis has antibacterial, antifungal  and antiviral actions however, the pharmacological activity of propolis is highly variable depending on its geographic origin. there have been few studies on the effects of iranian propolis on the oral microorganisms. in this in-vitro study, the antimicrobial activity of the ethanolic and water extracts of the iranian propolis (10%, w/v) from north-east area of tehran was evaluated. susceptibility  of the oral strains tested (streptococcus mutans atcc 35668; streptococcus salivarius atcc 9222; staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923; enterococcus faecalis atcc 9854 and lactobacillus casei atcc 39392) was evaluated using the agar diffusion method at a concentration of 20 mg/ml of propolis and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. antibacterial activity was determined by using minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) at different concentrations of propolis. the ethanolic extract showed bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity against all the strains, with mic and mbc ranges of 250-500 microg/ml. the mic concentration of the water extract was 500 microg/ml against s. mutans and e. faecalis. the water extract showed bactericidal activity only against s. mutans (20 mg/ml). these results indicate that the ethanolic extract is probably more useful in the control of oral biofilms and subsequent dental caries development. however, to determine the consequence of the ethanolic extract of iranian propolis on the oral mucosa, in-vivo studies of its possible effects are needed.

TI  == effect of garlic on bacterial biofilm formation on orthodontic wire.
AB  == objective: to examine the effect of garlic extract on the biofilm formation by streptococcus mutans on orthodontic wire and on glucosyltransferase gene expression. materials and methods: growth inhibition of oral bacteria was tested  after 50 microl of garlic extract was placed on an agar plate. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of garlic extract on s mutans growth was first determined. after cultivating streptococci in biofilm medium (bm)-sucrose with garlic extract and orthodontic wire, adenosine triphosphate (atp) measurement and viable cell counting was performed from the bacteria attached on the wire. scanning electron microscopy (sem) analysis of morphology was observed on bacterial cells attached to orthodontic wire. the effect of garlic extract on gene expression was evaluated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) of glucosyltransferase. results: though garlic extract had a clear antibacterial effect on all microorganisms, it also enhanced s mutans attachment  on orthodontic wire. low concentration of garlic extract also increased glucosyltransferase gene expression of s mutans. conclusions: despite its antibacterial function, garlic extract increases biofilm formation by s mutans to orthodontic wire, likely through upregulation of glucosyltransferase expression.  garlic extract may thus play an important role in increased bacterial attachment  to orthodontic wires.

TI  == streptococcus
AB  == the genus streptococcus , a heterogeneous group of gram-positive bacteria, has broad significance in medicine and industry. various streptococci are important ecologically as part of the normal microbial flora of animals and humans; some can also cause diseases that range from subacute to acute or even chronic. among  the significant human diseases attributable to streptococci are scarlet fever, rheumatic heart disease, glomerulonephritis, and pneumococcal pneumonia. streptococci are essential in industrial and dairy processes and as indicators of pollution. the nomenclature for streptococci, especially the nomenclature in medical use, has been based largely on serogroup identification of cell wall components rather than on species names. for several decades, interest has focused on two major species that cause severe infections: s pyogenes (group a streptococci) and s pneumoniae (pneumococci). in 1984, two members were assigned  a new genus - the group d enterococcal species (which account for 98% of human enterococcal infections) became enterococcus faecalis (the majority of human clinical isolates) and e faecium (associated with a remarkable capacity for antibiotic resistance). in recent years, increasing attention has been given to other streptococcal species, partly because innovations in serogrouping methods have led to advances in understanding the pathogenetic and epidemiologic significance of these species. a variety of cell-associated and extracellular products are produced by streptococci, but their cause-effect relationship with pathogenesis has not been defined. some of the other medically important streptococci are s agalactiae (group b), an etiologic agent of neonatal disease;  e faecalis (group d), a major cause of endocarditis, and the viridans streptococci. particularly for the viridans streptococci, taxonomy and nomenclature are not yet fully reliable or consistent. important members of the viridans streptococci, normal commensals, include s mutans and s sanguis (involved in dental caries), s mitis (associated with bacteremia, meningitis, periodontal disease and pneumonia), and "s milleri" (associated with suppurative  infections in children and adults). there remains persistent taxonomic confusion  regarding "s milleri." these and other streptococci of medical importance are listed intable 13-1by serogroup designation, normal ecologic niche, and associated disease.

TI  == spectrum of early-onset and late-onset bacteremias after liver transplantation: implications for management.
AB  == bacteremia is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality after liver transplantation. the characterization of the microbiological spectrum of bacteremia after liver transplantation may help physicians in choosing the initial empirical antimicrobial therapy for patients presenting with sepsis. the  clinical and microbiology records of patients who received liver transplantation  from january 1997 to march 2006 were reviewed. one hundred twenty-three of the 737 liver recipients (16.7%) developed bacteremia during the median follow-up period of 5.8 years (interquartile range = 2.5-8.8 years); 92 patients (12.5%) had gram-positive bacteremia (gpb), whereas 47 (6.4%) had gram-negative bacteremia (gnb). nosocomial bacteremia was significantly more frequent among patients with early-onset gpb or gnb versus patients with late-onset gpb (66.7% versus 23.7%, p < 0.001) or gnb (70.6% versus 20.0%, p = 0.001). peritonitis (33.3% versus 7.9%, p = 0.004) and wound infections (13.0% versus 0%, p = 0.04) as sources were more common in patients with early-onset gpb versus patients with late-onset gpb. likewise, peritonitis was a more common source of early-onset gnb than late-onset gnb (41.2% versus 6.7%, p = 0.007). staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium were the most common pathogens in patients with early-onset  gpb, whereas enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus species were most common in  patients with late-onset gpb. pseudomonas aeruginosa and anaerobes were the most  common pathogens in patients with early-onset gnb, whereas escherichia coli was most common in patients with late-onset gnb. in conclusion, the microbiological spectra of early-onset and late-onset bacteremias differ, and this should be considered by those determining the initial empirical treatment of liver transplant recipients suspected to have bacteremias.

TI  == use of daptomycin in complicated cases of infective endocarditis.
AB  == infective endocarditis (ie) is a serious form of infection with a high mortality. medical management can be a challenge because of organ dysfunction, lack of clinical response or allergy to the recommended antibiotics. daptomycin is a lipopeptide antibiotic with a potent bactericidal activity against gram-positive  bacteria. there are limited data on the use of daptomycin in complicated cases of ie. we aim to report our experience of daptomycin use in complicated cases of ie  through a prospective observational study (from 1 october 2008 to 30 september 2009). daptomycin was prescribed for cases that were either unresponsive or allergic to the standard therapy. clinical characteristics and outcomes were reviewed. success was defined as clinical improvement accompanied with the resolution of laboratory markers of sepsis and continuation of the above findings for at least 8 weeks after the end of therapy. eight cases were evaluable. native and prosthetic valves were involved in equal proportions. the range of organisms  was wide: staphylococcus aureus, two cases; s. epidermidis, two cases; streptococci, two cases; and enterococcus faecalis, two cases. the median duration of therapy was 42 days. all patients were successfully treated. daptomycin was well tolerated. daptomycin is useful in the management of complicated cases of ie.

TI  == probiotic assessment of enterococcus faecalis cp58 isolated from human gut.
AB  == a total of seventy lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from the faeces of healthy humans and their identities were confirmed by sequencing of their 16s rdna genes. of these only 5 isolates were found to resist bile salts and indicated survival in the simulated in vitro digestion assay which reproduces the stomach and intestinal digestion indicating their tolerance to gastric enzymes and the low ph conditions. species that showed the best resistance to these conditions were: lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus sp., uncultured bifidobacteria, enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus anginosus. these strains  were investigated further to study their capacity to adhere to human intestinal caco-2 cells. e. faecalis was the most adherent strain. examination of the virulence determinants for this strain indicated that it was positive for efaafs, gele, agg, cpd, cob, ccf and cad, a profile that is similar to that of many e. faecalis isolates from food sources. the cytolysin biosynthetic genes cyla, cylb  and cylm that are more associated with the clinical isolates of e. faecium were not detected in this strain. the antibiotic susceptibility tests indicated that the strain was sensitive to vancomycin, tetracycline, rifampicin and erythromycin but resistant only to kanamycin and chloramphenicol. these data suggest that the  strain e. faecalis cp58 may be tested further for beneficial properties and developed as a new probiotic.

TI  == monitoring intestinal microbiota profile: a promising method for the ultraearly detection of colorectal cancer.
AB  == colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers and is very hard to be detected at an ultraearly stage because of lack of valuable predicating methods that often lead to treatment failure. intestinal microbiota has long been considered to implicate in colorectal cancer pathology; and many recent reports point out a close linkage between the intestinal bacteria and the genesis of the  tumor. present studies indicate that the structure and characteristics of the intestinal microbiota are significantly altered in colorectal cancer, precancerous lesion, and high risk population compared with healthy controls and  low risk population. based on the current studies and theories, we postulate monitoring the intestinal bacterial profile by the molecular methods that could fulfill the ultraearly prediction about the degree of the risk developing into colorectal cancer. further population-based epidemiological study is useful to reveal the characteristics of the intestinal microbiota in ultraearly colorectal  cancer, which might provide some novel prophylactic and therapeutic strategies for the colorectal cancer.

TI  == phenotypic and genotypic analyses of lactic acid bacteria in local fermented food, breast milk and faeces of mothers and their babies.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are generally accepted as beneficial to the host and their presence is directly influenced by ingestion of fermented food or probiotics. while the intestinal lactic microbiota is well-described knowledge on its routes of inoculation and competitiveness towards selective pressure shaping  the intestinal microbiota is limited. in this study, lab were isolated from faecal samples of breast feeding mothers living in syria, from faeces of their infants, from breast milk as well as from fermented food, typically consumed in syria. a total of 700 isolates were characterized by genetic fingerprinting with  random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) and identified by comparative 16s rdna sequencing and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms) analyses. thirty six different species of lactobacillus, enterococcus, streptococcus, weissella and pediococcus were identified. rapd and maldi-tof-ms patterns allowed comparison of the lactic microbiota on species and strain level. whereas some species were unique for one  source, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and lactobacillus brevis were found in all sources. interestingly, identical rapd genotypes of l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis and p. pentosaceus were found in the faeces of mothers, her milk and in faeces of her babies. diversity of rapd types found in food versus human samples suggests the importance of host factors in colonization and individual host specificity, and support the hypothesis that there is a vertical  transfer of intestinal lab from the mother's gut to her milk and through the milk to the infant's gut.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of ceftobiprole against clinical isolates from french teaching hospitals: proposition of zone diameter breakpoints.
AB  == the aims of this study were to determine the in vitro activity profile of ceftobiprole, a pyrrolidinone cephalosporin, against a large number of bacterial  pathogens and to propose zone diameter breakpoints for clinical categorisation according to the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) breakpoints. mics of ceftobiprole were determined by broth microdilution against 1548 clinical isolates collected in eight french hospitals. disk diffusion testing was performed using 30 mug disks according to the method of the comite de l'antibiogramme de la societe francaise de microbiologie (ca-sfm). the in vitro activity of ceftobiprole, expressed by mic(50/90) (mics for 50% and 90% of the organisms, respectively) (mg/l), was as follows: meticillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, 0.25/0.5; meticillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), 1/2; meticillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), 0.12/0.5; meticillin-resistant cons, 1/2; penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, </= 0.008/0.03; penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, 0.12/0.5; viridans group streptococci, 0.03/0.12; beta-haemolytic streptococci, </= 0.008/0.016; enterococcus faecalis,  0.25/1; enterococcus faecium, 64/128; enterobacteriaceae, 0.06/32; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4/16; acinetobacter baumannii, 0.5/64; haemophilus influenzae, 0.03/0.12; and moraxella catarrhalis, 0.25/0.5. according to the regression curve, zone diameter breakpoints could be 28, 26, 24 and 22 mm for mics of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 mg/l respectively. in conclusion, this study confirms the potent in vitro activity of ceftobiprole against many gram-positive bacteria, including mrsa but not e. faecium, whilst maintaining a gram-negative spectrum similar to the advanced-generation cephalosporins such as cefepime. thus ceftobiprole appears to be well suited for the empirical treatment of a variety of healthcare-associated infections.

TI  == evaluation of three swab transport systems for the maintenance of clinically important bacteria in simulated mono- and polymicrobial samples.
AB  == in this study, three swab transport systems were evaluated: m40 transystem, amies broth with a relatively new type of swab (both copan diagnostics, corona, ca, usa), and ssi transportmedium (statens serum institut, copenhagen denmark). the clsi m40-a standard procedures and 11 culture collection strains were used. the transport systems were tested at room temperature for holding times of 0, 24, and 48 h, and both mono- and polymicrobial samples were included. after 24 h of simulated transportation, all systems were able to maintain the viability of all  organisms tested. ssi transportmedium exhibited the lowest maintaining ability, whereas the two copan systems were the most growth-promoting system. in polymicrobial samples, this latter feature was a problem. at 48 h, no transport system could maintain the viability of all strains, and the recovery rates differed depending on organism and device. the species most difficult to recover  in all the three systems was neisseria gonorrhoeae. when selecting a swab transport system, consideration must be given to the sample type, the conditions  that prevail locally, and the performance in the clinical setting.

TI  == comparative genome-wide analysis of small rnas of major gram-positive pathogens:  from identification to application.
AB  == in the recent years, the number of drug- and multi-drug-resistant microbial strains has increased rapidly. therefore, the need to identify innovative approaches for development of novel anti-infectives and new therapeutic targets is of high priority in global health care. the detection of small rnas (srnas) in bacteria has attracted considerable attention as an emerging class of new gene expression regulators. several experimental technologies to predict srna have been established for the gram-negative model organism escherichia coli. in many respects, srna screens in this model system have set a blueprint for the global and functional identification of srnas for gram-positive microbes, but the functional role of srnas in colonization and pathogenicity for listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis and clostridium difficile is almost completely unknown. here, we report  the current knowledge about the srnas of these socioeconomically relevant gram-positive pathogens, overview the state-of-the-art high-throughput srna screening methods and summarize bioinformatics approaches for genome-wide srna identification and target prediction. finally, we discuss the use of modified peptide nucleic acids (pnas) as a novel tool to inactivate potential srna and their applications in rapid and specific detection of pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == cross-resistance to lincosamides, streptogramins a, and pleuromutilins due to the lsa(c) gene in streptococcus agalactiae ucn70.
AB  == streptococcus agalactiae ucn70, isolated from a vaginal swab obtained in new zealand, is resistant to lincosamides and streptogramins a (ls(a) phenotype) and  also to tiamulin (a pleuromutilin). by whole-genome sequencing, we identified a 5,224-bp chromosomal extra-element that comprised a 1,479-bp open reading frame coding for an abc protein (492 amino acids) 45% identical to lsa(a), a protein related to intrinsic ls(a) resistance in enterococcus faecalis. expression of this novel gene, named lsa(c), in s. agalactiae bm132 after cloning led to an increase in mics of lincomycin (0.06 to 4 mug/ml), clindamycin (0.03 to 2 mug/ml), dalfopristin (2 to >32 mug/ml), and tiamulin (0.12 to 32 mug/ml), whereas no change in mics of erythromycin (0.06 mug/ml), azithromycin (0.03 mug/ml), spiramycin (0.25 mug/ml), telithromycin (0.03 mug/ml), and quinupristin  (8 mug/ml) was observed. the phenotype was renamed the ls(a)p phenotype on the basis of cross-resistance to lincosamides, streptogramins a, and pleuromutilins.  this gene was also identified in similar genetic environments in 17 other s. agalactiae clinical isolates from new zealand exhibiting the same ls(a)p phenotype, whereas it was absent in susceptible s. agalactiae strains. interestingly, this extra-element was bracketed by a 7-bp duplication of a target site (attagaa), suggesting that this structure was likely a mobile genetic element. in conclusion, we identified a novel gene, lsa(c), responsible for the acquired ls(a)p resistance phenotype in s. agalactiae. dissection of the biochemical basis of resistance, as well as demonstration of in vitro mobilization of lsa(c), remains to be performed.

TI  == suprathel-antiseptic matrix: in vitro model for local antiseptic treatment?
AB  == acetic acid is a traditional antiseptic agent that has been used for more than 6000 years. the main goal of this study was to demonstrate the suitability of suprathel (polymedics innovations gmbh, denkendorf, germany) in combination with  various antiseptic agents to create an "antiseptic-matrix" especially designed for problematic microorganisms such as proteus vulgaris, acinetobacter baumannii, or pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are frequently associated with burns. the study  was designed to test the in vitro antimicrobial effect of a "suprathel-antiseptic matrix" (suprathel combined with acetic acid 3%, povidone-iodine 11% [betaisodona], polyhexanide 0.04% [lavasept], phenoxyethanol 2%/octenidine dihydrochloride 0.1% [octenisept], mafenide acetate 5%, and chlorhexidine gluconate 1.5%/cetrimid 15% [hibicet]). as a means to assess the typical bacterial spectrum of a burn unit, the following gram-negative and gram-positive  bacteria strains were tested: escherichia coli, p vulgaris, p aeruginosa, a baumannii, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s aureus, and beta-hemolytic streptococcus groups a and b. the tests showed a positive bactericidal effect of the suprathel-antiseptic matrix, particularly with problematic gram-negative bacteria such as p vulgaris, p aeruginosa, and a baumannii, except for the combination of  suprathel and mafenide acetate. it can be concluded that suprathel-antiseptic matrix appears to be suitable as a local antiseptic agent, but clinical studies need to be performed to confirm these in vitro observations. the authors' previous studies have shown that acetic acid demonstrates a wide antiseptic spectrum for microorganisms typically found in burn patients. the combination of  suprathel and acetic acid worked well in this study and appears to be promising for future clinical application.

AB  == introduction: endodontic infections are caused by polymicrobial biofilms. therefore, novel root canal disinfectants should be evaluated not only on single-species biofilms but also on dual- or mixed-species biofilms. a simple, high-throughput assay is urgently needed for this. in this study, the application of the resazurin metabolism assay was investigated for the evaluation of a root canal disinfectant on dual-species biofilms. methods: enterococcus faecalis with  or without streptococcus mutans in biofilms were formed in an active attachment biofilm model for 24 hours. subsequently, the biofilms were treated with various  concentrations of naocl for 1 minute. after resazurin metabolism by both organisms was confirmed, treatment efficacies using 0.0016% resazurin were evaluated. results: during naocl treatments, resazurin metabolism displays a clear dose response, not only in single-species e. faecalis (or s. mutans) biofilms but also in dual-species biofilms. notably, the assay revealed that the  resistance of dual-species biofilms to naocl was 30-fold higher than in single-species e. faecalis biofilms. viability counts on a selected naocl treatment (0.004%) confirmed this result and showed the increased resistance of e. faecalis in dual-species biofilms. conclusions: clearly, the high-throughput and low cost resazurin metabolism assay has a great potential for testing novel root canal antimicrobial agents in mixed-species biofilms.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of e-101 solution, a novel myeloperoxidase-mediated antimicrobial, against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens.
AB  == objectives: e-101 solution (e-101) is a novel myeloperoxidase-mediated antimicrobial. it is composed of porcine myeloperoxidase (pmpo), glucose oxidase, glucose as the substrate and specific amino acids in an aqueous vehicle. e-101 is being developed for topical application directly into surgical wounds to prevent  surgical site infections (ssis). the in vitro activity of e-101 was investigated. methods: mic, mbc, time-kill and antimicrobial combination experiments were performed according to clsi guidelines with modifications. resistance selection studies were performed using a serial passage method. results: e-101 showed mic(90) values of 0.03, 0.5 and 0.5 mg pmpo/l for staphylococci (n = 140), streptococci (n = 95) and enterococci (n = 55), respectively. mic(90) values ranged between 0.03-0.5 and </= 0.004-0.12 mg pmpo/l for enterobacteriaceae (n =  148) and gram-negative non-enterobacteriaceae (n = 92) strains, respectively. there was no antimicrobial tolerance to e-101 for staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae or streptococcus pyogenes. time-kill studies demonstrated a rapid (<30 min) bactericidal effect against s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner. there was no evidence of stable resistance to e-101 among staphylococci, enterococci, e. coli or p. aeruginosa strains and no evidence of e-101 interaction with antibiotics commonly used in clinical medicine. conclusions e-101 shows potent and broad-spectrum in vitro activity against bacteria that are the causative pathogens of ssis, thereby providing the impetus to test its clinical utility in the prevention of ssis.

TI  == characterization of three lactic acid bacteria and their isogenic ldh deletion mutants shows optimization for yatp (cell mass produced per mole of atp) at their physiological phs.
AB  == several lactic acid bacteria use homolactic acid fermentation for generation of atp. here we studied the role of the lactate dehydrogenase enzyme on the general  physiology of the three homolactic acid bacteria lactococcus lactis, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pyogenes. of note, deletion of the ldh genes hardly affected the growth rate in chemically defined medium under microaerophilic conditions. however, the growth rate was affected in rich medium. furthermore, deletion of ldh affected the ability for utilization of various substrates as a carbon source. a switch to mixed acid fermentation was observed during glucose-limited continuous growth and was dependent on the growth rate for s. pyogenes and on the ph for e. faecalis. in s. pyogenes and l. lactis, a change in ph resulted in a clear change in y(atp) (cell mass produced per mole of atp). the ph that showed the highest y(atp) corresponded to the ph of the natural habitat of the organisms.

TI  == [a clinical analysis of 25 cases of prosthetic valve endocarditis].
AB  == objective: to report the clinical characteristics of prosthetic valve endocarditis (pve). methods: all 25 cases of definite pve (duke criteria) diagnosed at our hospital between january 1992 to december 2008 were retrospectively analyzed. among them, 7 cases were pathologically confirmed and the others were clinically confirmed with either 2 major criteria or 1 major and  >/= 3 minor criteria. their clinical characteristics, underlying heart diseases,  previous heart operations, presenting manifestations, causative microbes, echocardiographic findings and prognosis, were studied. results: (1) although most cases underwent valve transplantations for underlying heart diseases of rheumatic heart diseases and congenital heart diseases, 10 patients were complicated with infectious endocarditis (ie) prior to the operations, 4 of them  were pve. (2) eleven of them developed pve within 2 months postoperatively. fever (100%), major vessel embolism (48%), and anemia (36%) were the most frequently manifestations. fourteen cases (56%) had positive culture results with 15 causative pathogens, including 5 coagulase-negative staphylococcus (cns, 3 were methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococcus, mrscon), 4 fungi, 2 enterococcus faecalis, 2 burkholderia cepacia, 1 stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and 1 streptococcus. (3) prosthetic valve vegetations, periannular leakage, regurgitation, were the main echocardiographic findings. transesophageal echocardiography (tee) revealed 13 pve who had no positive findings on previous transthoracic echocardiography (tte). (4) eighteen pve (72%) developed peri-annular complications (12 leakage, 3 dehiscence, 2 abscesses, 1 fistula), major vessel embolism, congestive heart failure (16%) were frequently observed, 9 of the 17 patients died in hospital, in spite of intensive managements. conclusions: pve has a high mortality and is a severe complication for patients who underwent heart surgery. its causative pathogen spectrum is quite different from that of native valve endocarditis. tte is not sensitive for some pve cases.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of doripenem against clinical isolates from french teaching hospitals: proposition of zone diameter breakpoints.
AB  == the aims of the study were to determine the in vitro activity of doripenem, a new carbapenem, against a large number of bacterial pathogens and to propose zone diameter breakpoints for clinical categorization in france according to the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) breakpoints. the mics of doripenem were determined by the broth microdilution method against 1,547 clinical isolates from eight french hospitals. the disk diffusion test was performed (10-mug discs) according  to the comite de l'antibiogramme de la societe francaise de microbiologie (casfm) method. the mic(50/90) (mg/l) values were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (0.03/0.25), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (1/2), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (mscons) (0.03/0.12), methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (mrcons) (2/8), streptococcus pneumoniae (0.016/0.25), viridans group streptococci (0.016/2), beta-hemolytic streptococci (</=0.008/</=0.008), enterococcus faecalis (2/4), enterococcus faecium (128/>128), enterobacteriaceae  (0.06/0.25), pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.5/8), acinetobacter baumannii (0.25/2), haemophilus influenzae (0.12/0.25), and moraxella catarrhalis (0.03/0.06). according to the regression curve, the zone diameter breakpoints were 24 and 19 mm for mics of 1 and 4 mg/l, respectively. this study confirms the potent in vitro activity of doripenem against pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter, enterobacteriaceae, mssa, mscons, and respiratory pathogens. according to the eucast mic breakpoints (mg/l) </=1/>4 for enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter, and </=1/>1 for streptococci, pneumococci, and haemophilus, the zone diameter breakpoints could be (mm) >/=24/<19 and >/=24/<24, respectively.

TI  == tetracycline resistance associated with commensal bacteria from representative ready-to-consume deli and restaurant foods.
AB  == proper knowledge of antibiotic resistance (ar) dissemination is essential for effective mitigation. this study examined the profiles of tetracycline-resistant  (tetr) commensal bacteria from representative ready-to-consume food samples from  salad bars at local grocery stores and restaurants. out of 900 tetr isolates examined, 158 (17.6%) carried one or more of tetm, tetl, tets, and tetk genes by  conventional pcr, 28 harbored more than one tetr determinants. the most prevalent genotype was tetm, which was detected in 70.9% of the ar gene carriers, followed  by tetl (31.6%), tets (13.9%), and tetk (2.5%). identified ar gene carriers included enterococcus, lactococcus, staphylococcus, brochothrix, carnobacterium,  stenotrophomonas, pseudomonas, and sphingobacterium, by 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. ar determinants were successfully transmitted, and led to resistance in streptococcus mutans via natural gene transformation and enterococcus faecalis via electroporation, suggesting the functionality and mobility of the ar genes from the food commensal bacteria. in addition, the ar traits in many isolates are quite stable, even in the absence of the selective pressure. the identification of new commensal carriers for representative ar genes revealed the involvement of a broad spectrum of bacteria in the horizontal transmission of ar genes. meanwhile, the spectrum of the antibiotic-resistant bacteria differed from the spectrum of the total bacteria (by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) associated with the food items. our data revealed a common avenue in ar exposure  and will assist in proper risk assessment and the development of comprehensive mitigation strategies to effectively combat ar.

TI  == anti-bacterial activity of intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy: comparative in vitro study of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine, mefloquine,  and azithromycin.
AB  == background: intermittent preventive treatment of malaria with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) is recommended for the prevention of malaria in pregnancy in sub-saharan africa. increasing drug resistance necessitates the urgent evaluation of alternative drugs. currently, the most promising candidates  in clinical development are mefloquine and azithromycin. besides the anti-malarial activity, sp is also a potent antibiotic and incurs significant anti-microbial activity when given as iptp - though systematic clinical evaluation of this action is still lacking. methods: in this study, the intrinsic anti-bacterial activity of mefloquine and azithromycin was assessed in comparison to sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine against bacterial pathogens with clinical importance in pregnancy in a standard microdilution assay. results: sp was highly active against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. all tested gram-positive bacteria, except enterococcus faecalis, were sensitive to azithromycin. additionally, azithromycin was active against neisseria gonorrhoeae. mefloquine showed good activity against pneumococci but lower in vitro action against all other tested pathogens. conclusion: these data indicate  important differences in the spectrum of anti-bacterial activity for the evaluated anti-malarial drugs. given the large scale use of iptp in africa, the need for prospective clinical trials evaluating the impact of antibiotic activity of anti-malarials on maternal and foetal health and on the risk of promoting specific drug resistance of bacterial pathogens is discussed.

TI  == myeloperoxidase selectively binds and selectively kills microbes.
AB  == myeloperoxidase (mpo) is reported to selectively bind to bacteria. the present study provides direct evidence of mpo binding selectivity and tests the relationship of selective binding to selective killing. the microbicidal effectiveness of h(2)o(2) and of ocl(-) was compared to that of mpo plus h(2)o(2). synergistic microbicidal action was investigated by combining streptococcus sanguinis, a h(2)o(2)-producing microbe showing low mpo binding, with high-mpo-binding escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, or pseudomonas aeruginosa without exogenous h(2)o(2), with and without mpo, and with and without erythrocytes (red blood cells [rbcs]). selectivity of mpo microbicidal action was conventionally measured as the mpo mic and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) for 82 bacteria including e. coli, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and viridans streptococci. both h(2)o(2) and ocl(-) destroyed rbcs at submicrobicidal concentrations. nanomolar concentrations of mpo increased h(2)o(2) microbicidal action 1,000-fold. streptococci plus mpo produced potent synergistic microbicidal action against all microbes tested, and rbcs caused only a small decrease in potency without erythrocyte damage. mpo directly killed h(2)o(2)-producing s. pyogenes but was ineffective against non-h(2)o(2)-producing e. faecalis. the mpo  mics and mbcs for e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and s. aureus were significantly lower  than those for e. faecalis. the streptococcal studies showed much higher mic/mbc  results, but such testing required lysed horse blood-supplemented medium, thus preventing valid comparison of these results to those for the other microbes. e.  faecalis mpo binding is reportedly weak compared to binding of e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and s. aureus but strong compared to binding of streptococci. selective mpo binding results in selective killing.

TI  == synergism between maggot excretions and antibiotics.
AB  == maggots are successfully used to treat severe, infected wounds. this study investigated whether maggot excretions/secretions influence the antibacterial activity of different antibiotics. minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal  bactericidal concentrations (mbc) were determined of gentamicin and flucloxacillin for staphylococcus aureus, of penicillin for streptococcus pyogenes, of amoxicillin and vancomycin for enterococcus faecalis, of gentamicin  for enterobacter cloacae, and of gentamicin, tobramycin, and ciprofloxacin for pseudomonas aeruginosa by checkerboard titration. a range of concentrations of antibiotics in combination with excretions/secretions was examined to investigate the potential of maggot excretions/secretions to affect antibacterial activity. the results showed a dose-dependent increase of the antibacterial effect of gentamicin in the presence of excretions/secretions on s. aureus. minimal concentrations and mbc of gentamicin decreased, respectively, 64- and 32-fold. the mbc of flucloxacillin and excretions/secretions against s. aureus were also decreased. the other antibiotic and excretions/secretions combinations exerted an indifferent effect. excretions/secretions alone did not have any antibacterial effect. the synergism between gentamicin and maggot excretions/secretions could be of direct importance in clinical practice, because it could allow the use of lower doses of gentamicin and thus minimize the risk of gentamicin-related side effects.

TI  == evidence of bacterial biofilms in nasal polyposis.
AB  == introduction: the pathogeny of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (crs/np) has not been elucidated. bacterial exotoxins have been implicated in many inflammatory chronic diseases, such as chronic otitis, chronic tonsillitis,  cholesteatomas, and more recently crs/np. we propose that the bacteria in crs/np  are not only present in a planktonic state, but also occur in microbial communities as biofilms. objective: to determine and characterize the presence of biofilms in crs/np. methods: we performed a prospective study in 12 patients undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery for nasal polyposis. ten patients without crs/np who underwent septoplasty were included as a control group. tissue samples were obtained from the inferior turbinate mucosae. the bacteria were isolated and typified and the material was examined in vitro using a spectrophotometer, and in vivo using optical microscopy and confocal scanning laser microscopy. results: moderate to high in vitro biofilm-forming capacity was detected in 9 out of 12 patients with crs/np (mean [sd] optical density values of between 0.284 [0.017] and 3.337 [0.029]). the microorganisms isolated were staphylococcus (5 patients), streptococcus viridans, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus viridans/corynebacterium. biofilms were demonstrated in vivo in 2 patients and no biofilm structures were evident in any of the controls. conclusion: this study demonstrates the presence of bacterial biofilms in patients with crs/np. this chronic inflammatory factor might contribute to nasal  mucosa damage, increased inflammatory cells in tissue, and the subsequent hyperplasic process.

AB  == objectives: to evaluate the in vivo antibacterial efficacy of nemonoxacin, a novel c8-methoxy non-fluorinated quinolone in murine systemic and local infection models. methods: the efficacy of nemonoxacin in systemic infections was evaluated in mouse peritonitis models using isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa, n=1), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa, n=1), methicillin- and levofloxacin-resistant staphylococcus capitis (levofloxacin-resistant mrsc, n=1), penicillin-intermediate streptococcus pneumoniae (pisp, n=1), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp, n=2), enterococcus faecalis (n=2, including 1 vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, vre) and escherichia coli (n=3). the local infections included mouse pulmonary infections caused by prsp (n=1), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=1) and mouse ascending  urinary tract infection caused by e. coli (n=1). results: in the mouse systemic infection model, nemonoxacin demonstrated potent activity against mssa (ed(50) =2.08 mg/kg), mrsa (ed(50) =2.59 mg/kg), levofloxacin-resistant mrsc (ed(50) =2.52 mg/kg), pisp (ed(50) =5.47 mg/kg), prsp (ed(50) =3.68-5.28 mg/kg) and e. coli (ed(50) =3.13-5.28 mg/kg), and moderate activity towards e. faecalis infection (ed(50) =8.48-15.16 mg/kg). the therapeutic efficacy of nemonoxacin was significantly higher (p<0.01) than that of levofloxacin in infections caused by gram-positive isolates (mssa, mrsa, levofloxacin-resistant mrsc, pisp, prsp and e. faecalis), but less potent than that of levofloxacin against e. coli infection (p<0.01). nemonoxacin in vivo efficacy results with gram-positive isolates (2- to 5-fold ed(50) advantage over levofloxacin) are consistent with the mic data (4- to 16-fold mic advantage of nemonoxacin over levofloxacin). in the mouse pulmonary infection model, nemonoxacin showed potent activity towards prsp (higher than levofloxacin) and k. pneumoniae (lower than levofloxacin) infections. in the mouse ascending urinary tract infection model, nemonoxacin exhibited potent activity against e. coli infection (lower than levofloxacin). conclusions: the results validated the potent efficacy of nemonoxacin in vivo. the higher efficacy of nemonoxacin than of levofloxacin towards infections caused by gram-positive cocci (especially mrsa, levofloxacin-resistant mrsc, prsp and vre) warrants investigation of its clinical use.

TI  == susceptibility of endodontic pathogens to antibiotics in patients with symptomatic apical periodontitis.
AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was to evaluate susceptibility of predominant endodontic pathogens isolated from teeth with symptomatic apical periodontitis to most commonly prescribed antibiotics. methods: among 58 patients with symptomatic apical periodontitis, 47 and 11 cases were caused by primary and secondary root canal infection, respectively. the microbial samples were taken either from the root canals (35 cases) or by aspiration from apical abscesses (23 cases). culture methods were used to identify the microorganisms present in the samples. antibiotic susceptibilities of all isolates were evaluated by using the e-test method. results: microorganisms were isolated from 49 of the 58 samples studied and included facultative and obligate anaerobes. streptococci and obligate anaerobes were the predominant microorganisms in cases of primary infection. enterococcus faecalis dominated in cases of secondary infection. all tested microorganisms were highly sensitive to penicillin g, amoxicillin, and ampicillin. susceptibilities to clindamycin and erythromycin were 73.8% and 54.7%, respectively. about 40% of the isolates were resistant to tetracycline. more than 50% of all anaerobes were resistant to metronidazole. all e. faecalis isolates were resistant to clindamycin. conclusions: based on the study results,  penicillin and amoxicillin are suitable antibiotics for treatment of endodontic infection when conventional root canal treatment alone is insufficient. clindamycin could be advised for penicillin-allergic patients with primary endodontic infections.

TI  == photokilling of bacteria by curcumin in selected polyethylene glycol 400 (peg 400) preparations. studies on curcumin and curcuminoids, xli.
AB  == curcumin, bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione, is a yellow-orange pigment which can be synthesised chemically or isolated from the plant curcuma longa l. curcumin has a rather broad absorption peak in the range 300-500 nm (maximum approximately 430 nm) and has potential as a photosensitiser  for treatment of localised superficial infections in e.g., the mouth or skin. previously, we have demonstrated phototoxic effects of curcumin in selected aqueous preparations against both gram-positive enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus intermedius and gram-negative escherichia coil bacteria in vitro. one of the most efficient preparations was curcumin in polyethylene glycol (peg 400) dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (pbs), ph 6.1. in this study the solubilising effect of peg 400 on curcumin molecules and the in vitro phototoxic  effects of these preparations were further evaluated. the effect of varying the curcumin concentration (2.50 microm -25.00 microm), the radiant exposure (0.5-30  j/cm2) and the physical state of curcumin against the survival of e. coli was investigated. peg 400 showed an increasing physically stabilising effect towards  crystallisation of curcumin in aqueous preparation with increasing concentrations (2.5%-10.0% v/v). despite a higher solubility of curcumin with increasing peg 400 concentrations, the surfactant reduced the phototoxicity of curcumin against e. coil. the highest phototoxic effect was obtained when curcumin was present in the least physically stable preparation, a stock solution in ethanol added to pbs with or without the lowest test concentration of peg 400 (2.5% v/v). the obtained phototoxic effect can be increased by increasing the irradiation dose or by choosing an optimal curcumin concentration. e. faecalis was efficiently killed by the lowest concentration of curcumin in combination with the lowest radiant exposure when curcumin was dissolved in certain peg solutions (< 0.02% survival), but showed no reduction when exposed to preirradiated curcumin.

AB  == promoter-probe and terminator-probe plasmid vectors make possible to rapidly examine whether particular sequences function as promoter or terminator signals in various genetic backgrounds and under diverse environmental stimuli. at present, such plasmid-based genetic tools are very scarce in the gram-positive pathogenic bacteria streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis. hence, we developed novel promoter-probe and terminator-probe vectors based on the streptococcus agalactiae pmv158 plasmid, which replicates autonomously in numerous gram-positive bacteria. as reporter gene, a gfp allele encoding a variant of the green fluorescent protein was used. these genetic tools were shown to be suitable to assess the activity of promoters and terminators (both homologous and heterologous) in s. pneumoniae and e. faecalis. in addition, the promoter-probe vector was shown to be a valuable tool for the analysis of regulated promoters in vivo, such as the promoter of the pneumococcal fuculose kinase gene. these new plasmid vectors will be very useful for the experimental verification of predicted promoter and terminator sequences, as well as for the construction of new inducible-expression vectors. given the promiscuity exhibited by the pmv158 replicon, these vectors could be used in a variety of gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == phenotyping and genotyping of streptococci in bovine milk in argentinean dairy herds.
AB  == most veterinary and milk hygiene laboratories identify streptococci and enterococci based on serological and biochemical tests. the analysis of 16s rdna  was suggested to be used for more exact identification; however, its use has not  been considered so far in monitoring studies. the objective of the present study  was to compare a conventional phenotypic method with restriction fragment length  polymorphism analysis of 16s rdna (16s rdna rflp) for identification of streptococci isolated from composite milk samples collected in connection with intramammary infection (imi) in six argentinean dairy farms. composite milk samples (n = 1223) from cows belonging to six herds were collected for bacteriological analysis. twelve reference strains and fifty streptococci or streptococcuslike isolates were identified to species level by the api 20 strep system, conventional biochemical tests and 16s rdna rflp in a blind assay. the remaining streptococci or streptococcus-like isolates (n = 40) were identified to the species level both by 16s rdna rflp and conventional biochemical tests. as indicated by kappa values, agreement between the 16s rdna rflp and the conventional scheme for identification of streptococcus agalactiae, s. dysgalactiae, s. uberis, s. equinus and enterococcus faecalis was 0.91, 0.73, 0.92, 0.81 and 0.85, respectively. together with the less frequently isolated streptococcal species, the conventional scheme correctly identified 77 out of 90  isolates (85.5%). thus, the use of 16s rdna rflp is considered valuable for monitoring studies due to its affordable cost for standard laboratories.

TI  == biological activity of the essential oil of kadsura longipedunculata (schisandraceae) and its major components.
AB  == objectives: the aim was to determine the chemical composition of the essential oil of kadsura longipedunculata and the biological activity of the oil and its major components. methods: the essential oil from stem bark of kadsura longipedunculata was analysed by capillary gas chromatography (glc/fid) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (glc/ms). the ability of the oil to reduce diphenylpicrylhydrazine (dpph(*)) was used to evaluate the antioxidant activity.  inhibition of both lipoxygenase and prostaglandin e(2) was used to assess the anti-inflammatory activity. antimicrobial activity was studied in vitro against a range of bacteria and fungi using diffusion and microdilution methods. inhibition of trypanosome proliferation was assessed using resazurin as vital stain. the in-vitro cytotoxicity of the essential oil on six human cancer cell lines (hepg2, mia paca-2, hela, hl-60, mda-mb-231 and sw-480) was examined using the mtt assay. key findings: fifty compounds, representing 97.63% of total oil, were identified. delta-cadinene (21.79%), camphene (7.27%), borneol (6.05%), cubenol (5.12%) and delta-cadinol (5.11%) were found to be the major components of the oil. the oil exerted a good antimicrobial activity against all gram-positive bacteria tested,  including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis. streptococcus pyogenes and s. agalactiae were the most sensitive bacteria with a minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of 60 microg/ml  oil. the essential oil showed a moderate fungicidal activity against yeasts, but  it did not show any activity against gram-negative bacteria. the essential oil showed a good trypanocidal activity in trypanosoma b. brucei with an ic50 value of 50.52 +/- 0.029 microg/ml. radical scavenging activity had an ic50 value of 3.06 +/- 0.79 mg/ml. 5-lipoxygenase inhibition (ic50 = 38.58 microg/ml) and prostaglandin e(2) production inhibition (28.82% at 25 microg/ml) accounted for anti-inflammatory activity of the oil. the oil exhibited some degree of cytotoxic activity against mia paca-2, hepg-2 and sw-480 cell lines with ic50 values of 133.53, 136.96 and 136.62 microg/ml, respectively. the oil increased caspase 3/7  activity (an indicator of apoptosis) 2.5-4 fold in mia paca-2 cells. camphene and borneol did not show antioxidant activity. however, both compounds exhibited some degree of antimicrobial, trypanocidal, anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic activity.  conclusions: this investigation provided evidence for, and confirmed the efficacy of, k. longipedunculata, a traditionally used chinese medicinal plant for the treatment of inflammation and infection.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of rosmarinus officinalis against oral pathogens: relevance of carnosic acid and carnosol.
AB  == the in vitro inhibitory activity of crude etoh/h2o extracts from the leaves and stems of rosmarinus officinalis l. was evaluated against the following microorganisms responsible for initiating dental caries: streptococcus mutans, s. salivarius, s. sobrinus, s. mitis, s. sanguinis, and enterococcus faecalis. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) were determined with the broth microdilution method. the bioassay-guided fractionation of the leaf extract, which displayed the higher antibacterial activity than the stem extract, led to the identification of carnosic acid (2) and carnosol (3) as the major compounds in the fraction displaying the highest activity, as identified by hplc analysis.  rosmarinic acid (1), detected in another fraction, did not display any activity against the selected microorganisms. hplc analysis revealed the presence of low amounts of ursolic acid (4) and oleanolic acid (5) in the obtained fractions. the results suggest that the antimicrobial activity of the extract from the leaves of r. officinalis may be ascribed mainly to the action of 2 and 3.

TI  == prevalence and clinical outcome of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in hospitalized patients with liver cirrhosis: a prospective observational study in  central part of croatia.
AB  == spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (sbp) is a serious complication of liver cirrhosis and is defined as infected ascites in the absence of any recognizable secondary cause of infection. the aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence, incidence, pathogens and clinical outcome of sbp. this prospective observational study included 108 cirrhotic patients with ascites treated during 18 months. patients were divided into two groups according to diagnostic criteria of sbp: sbp group (n=23) and non-sbp group (n=85). differences in clinical outcomes between the two groups were analyzed, including mortality rate, incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, bacteremia/sepsis and frequency of rehospitalization. the pathogens responsible for sbp were analyzed in sbp group.  the prevalence of sbp was 21% and incidence 14.1% per year. statistically significant between-group differences were recorded in mortality (26% vs. 4.7%; p=0.017), incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding (39% vs. 11.7%; p=0.015) and rehospitalization frequency (47.8% vs. 20%; p=0.05). the incidence of sepsis following episode of gastrointestinal bleeding was similar in both groups (55.5%  vs. 50%; p=0.892). the following pathogens were responsible for sbp: escherichia  coli (n=7), mrsa (n=2), acinetobacter spp. (n=2), staphylococcus aureus (n=1), streptococcus spp. (n=1), staphylococcus epidermidis (n=1) and enterococcus faecalis (n=1). as indicated by study results, the incidence and mortality of sbp were high. patients with liver cirrhosis and gastrointestinal hemorrhage were found to be at a high risk of developing sepsis with or without clinically proven sbp. the pathogens responsible for sbp were mostly gram-negative microorganisms;  however, there were also a significant proportion of gram-positive microorganisms and hospital infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria. study results suggested the spectrum of pathogens to change due to the selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria within the hospital setting.

AB  == an analytical system based on rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr) for enumeration of catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci was established. subgroup- or species-specific primer sets targeting 16s or 23s rrna  from enterococcus, streptococcus, and lactococcus were newly developed. the rt-qpcr method using these primers together with the previously reported primer sets specific for the enterococcus genus, the streptococcus genus, and several streptococcus species was found to be able to quantify the target populations with detection limits of 10(3) to 10(4) cells per gram feces, which was more than 100 times as sensitive as the qpcr method (10(6) to 10(8) cells per gram feces).  the rt-qpcr analysis of fecal samples from 24 healthy adult volunteers using the  genus-specific primer sets revealed that enterococcus and streptococcus were present as intestinal commensals at population levels of log(10) 6.2 +/- 1.4 and  7.5 +/- 0.9 per gram feces (mean +/- standard deviation [sd]), respectively. detailed investigation using species- or subgroup-specific primer sets revealed that the volunteers harbored unique enterococcus species, including the e. avium  subgroup, the e. faecium subgroup, e. faecalis, the e. casseliflavus subgroup, and e. caccae, while the dominant human intestinal streptococcus species was found to be s. salivarius. various lactococcus species, such as l. lactis subsp.  lactis or l. lactis subsp. cremoris, l. garvieae, l. piscium, and l. plantarum, were also detected but at a lower population level (log(10) 4.6 +/- 1.2 per gram  feces) and prevalence (33%). these results suggest that the rt-qpcr method enables the accurate and sensitive enumeration of human intestinal subdominant but still important populations, such as gram-positive cocci.

TI  == [usefulness and limit of gram staining smear examination].
AB  == gram staining is one of the most simple and inexpensive methods for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial and fungal infections. it yields results much faster than  culture, and provides important data for the patient's treatment and prognosis. however, a difference exists in the quality and quantity of information yielded by gram staining smears based on the experience and knowledge of those conducting the tests. therefore, a risk of misdiagnosis based on the information obtained from gram staining smears is also present. the gram staining conditions and morphology of bacteria sometimes change due to antimicrobial therapy. species of  gram-negative rods sometimes become filamentous and pleomorphic. gram-positive bacteria may become gram variable (change in staining condition) after antimicrobial therapy. even bacteria that are easy to mis-identify exist, because the morphology of bacteria may be similar. enterococcus faecalis is a gram-positive diplococcus, forming gram-positive clustered cocci in specimens from blood culture bottles, resembling streptococcus pneumoniae. acinetobacter baumannii is a gram-negative diplococcus in sputum, resembling moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis. pasteurella multocida is a small-sized, gram-negative  short rod in the sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. prevotella intermedia is a small-sized, gram-negative short rod in sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. capnocytophaga sp. is a gram-negative fusiform (thin needle shape) rod present in clinical specimens, resembling fusobacterium nucleatum.

TI  == [interpretive reading of the antibiogram in gram positive cocci].
AB  == resistance to methicillin in staphylococcus is related to the expression of the meca gene, and involves resistance to all beta-lactams, with the exception of the new cephalosporins, ceftobiprole and ceftaroline. breakpoints for interpretation  of this mechanism differ in s. aureus and in coagulase-negative species. for macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramins b, (mls(b)) the most frequent mechanism among resistant strains is expression of methylases (erm genes). topoisomerase changes caused by point mutations and expression of the efflux pump nora determine resistance to quinolones, but there are great differences in the activity of different compounds, which makes interpretative reading difficult. strains of s. aureus with intermediate susceptibility to glycopeptides (gisa strains) have been described, as well as highly-vancomycin-resistant isolates (vana isolates). in spain, there is a high percentage of s. pneumoniae strains intermediate or resistant to penicillin, and a low percentage of strains intermediate or resistant to third generation cephalosporins, due to mutations in genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins. the most frequent phenotype of resistance to mls(b) in this species is caused by methylase production. resistance to quinolones is still uncommon, and is mainly related to mutations in parc/pare (low level) and in gyra. it is important to detect low level resistance due to its clinical implications. no strains of s. pyogenes resistant to penicillin have yet been described. in spain the most common phenotype of resistance to macrolides in s. pyogenes is determined by efflux pumps (mef genes), affecting 14- and 15-membered macrolides. e. faecalis is usually susceptible to ampicillin, in contrast to e. faecium. enterococci show intrinsic  low-level resistance to aminoglycosides, but still remain susceptible to the combination of these antimicrobials and cell-wall active agents. strains expressing different aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (high-level resistance) became resistant to the combination. glycopeptide-resistant strains of enterococci are uncommon in spain, but nosocomial outbreaks due to vana enterococci and case reports due to vanb2 enterococci have been recently reported.

TI  == intra- and interlaboratory performances of two commercial antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods for bifidobacteria and nonenterococcal lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == in a small-scale harmonization study involving nine laboratories in eight european countries, the intra- and interlaboratory performances of two commercially available systems, i.e., the vetmic microplate system and etest, for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of nonenterococcal lactic acid bacteria (nelab) and bifidobacteria were analyzed. in addition, one laboratory also performed standard broth microdilution as a reference method. mics of tetracycline, erythromycin, ampicillin, gentamicin, clindamycin, and streptomycin for the type strains of 25 species of nelab and bifidobacteria and mics of vancomycin for a selection of relevant taxa were determined. the previously described lactic acid bacterium susceptibility test medium (lsm) and related mixed-medium formulations, all including iso-sensitest broth as a basic component, were used as test media. the overall agreement of median mic ranges +/- 1 log(2) dilution determined by the vetmic and etest methods with the median  mics determined by the reference method was very good for tetracycline, ampicillin, and streptomycin (92.3 to 100%) but low for erythromycin (19.5 to 30.7%) and clindamycin (50.0 to 80.8%). there was a consensus among the participating laboratories that vetmic was preferred over etest because of its lower cost, better growth support, and more uniform criteria for mic end point reading. with the range for acceptable intralaboratory reproducibility being defined as the median mic +/- 1 log(2) dilution, vetmic results (with 69.2% of all data sets in the acceptable range) were shown to display greater reproducibility than etest results (with 58.8% of all data sets in the acceptable range). also at the interlaboratory level, the proportion of mic values obtained  with vetmic that belonged to the complete agreement category (60.0%) was higher than the proportion of such values obtained with etest (47.0%), which indicates a higher degree of interlaboratory reproducibility for the former method. apart from some agent-specific effects, the majority of vetmic and etest replicate data sets were situated within a 1- to 2-log(2) dilution range, suggesting that the two methods can be considered to be equivalent for recognizing resistance phenotypes. this multicenter study has further validated the standard use of lsm  and related mixed-medium formulations with commercially available systems and formed the basis for the ongoing development of the iso 10932/idf 223 standard for susceptibility testing of nelab and bifidobacteria.

TI  == endodontic photoactivated disinfection using a conventional light source: an in vitro and ex vivo study.
AB  == objective: the antimicrobial effect of photoactivated disinfection (pad) using toluidine blue and an led lamp was tested on endodontic pathogens in planktonic suspension and after inoculation into extracted teeth. irradiation time was limited to 30 seconds. study design: the effect of pad on planktonic suspensions  of escherichia coli, candida albicans, enterococcus faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and streptococcus intermedius was analyzed using poisson regression. moreover, cultures of s. intermedius were inoculated into prepared root canals of extracted molars. the effect of pad performed immediately after inoculation or after overnight bacterial incubation was determined by a 2-sample t test. results: photoactivated disinfection yielded significant reductions (p < .001) in the viable counts of all organisms in planktonic suspension. the pad treatment of s. intermedius in root canals yielded a mean log10 reduction of 2.60 (p < .001) immediately after inoculation and of 1.38 (p < .001) after overnight incubation.  conclusion: photoactivated disinfection using a conventional light source strongly reduces the number of viable endodontic pathogens in planktonic suspension and in root canals.

TI  == effect of chlorhexidine incorporation into a self-etching primer on dentine bond  strength of a luting cement.
AB  == objectives: this study investigated the effect of incorporating chlorhexidine in  a self-etching primer on the bond strength of an adhesive resin cement to dentine and on antibacterial activity. methods: experimental self-etching primers were prepared by adding chlorhexidine (chx) diacetate to ed primer 2.0 (kuraray medical inc.) to obtain chlorhexidine concentrations of 1.0 wt% and 2.0 wt%. human occlusal dentine surfaces were conditioned for 30 s using the experimental  primers or pure ed primer. composite blocks were luted using panavia f 2.0 (kuraray medical inc.). after storage in water for 24 h, the bonded teeth were sectioned into 0.9 mm x 0.9 mm beams and stressed to failure in tension to examine microtensile bond strength (microtbs). fractured surfaces were examined with a field-emission scanning electron microscopy (fe-sem). the morphology of dentine surfaces that were conditioned with each primer was also observed under fe-sem. an agar diffusion test was performed to examine the antibacterial effect  of each primer against streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis. results: addition of chlorhexidine to the primer had significant effects (p<0.001) on microtbs and antibacterial effect. no significant difference in microtbs was found between the groups that contained 0% and 1% chlorhexidine in the primer (p=0.095). conversely, the group that contained 2% chlorhexidine showed significantly lower microtbs and pronounced cohesive failures within the thin layer of the primer. conclusions: incorporation of chlorhexidine into ed primer 2.0 showed significant antibacterial activities. conditioning with the 1% chlorhexidine-containing primer had no adverse effect on microtbs.

TI  == a genetic determinant in streptococcus gordonii challis encodes a peptide with activity similar to that of enterococcal sex pheromone cam373, which facilitates  intergeneric dna transfer.
AB  == enterococcus faecalis strains secrete multiple peptides representing different sex pheromones that induce mating responses by bacteria carrying specific conjugative plasmids. the pheromone cam373, which induces a response by the enterococcal plasmid pam373, has been of interest because a similar activity is also secreted by streptococcus gordonii and staphylococcus aureus. the potential  to facilitate intergeneric dna transfer from e. faecalis is of concern because of extensive multiple antibiotic resistance, including vancomycin resistance, that has emerged among enterococci in recent years. here, we characterize the related  pheromone determinant in s. gordonii and show that the peptide it encodes, gordonii-cam373, does indeed induce transfer of plasmid dna from e. faecalis into s. gordonii. the streptococcal determinant camg encodes a lipoprotein with a leader sequence, the last 7 residues of which represent the gordonii-cam373 heptapeptide svfilaa. synthetic forms of the peptide had activity similar to that of the enterococcal cam373 aifilas. the lipoprotein moiety bore no resemblance to the lipoprotein encoded by e. faecalis. we also identified determinants in s. gordonii encoding a signal peptidase and an eep-like zinc metalloprotease (lspa and eep, respectively) similar to those involved in processing certain pheromone  precursors in e. faecalis. mutations generated in camg, lspa, and eep each resulted in the ablation of gordonii-cam373 activity in culture supernatants. this is the first genetic analysis of a potential sex pheromone system in a commensal oral streptococcal species, which may have implications for intergeneric gene acquisition in oral biofilms.

TI  == abundance of type i toxin-antitoxin systems in bacteria: searches for new candidates and discovery of novel families.
AB  == small, hydrophobic proteins whose synthesis is repressed by small rnas (srnas), denoted type i toxin-antitoxin modules, were first discovered on plasmids where they regulate plasmid stability, but were subsequently found on a few bacterial chromosomes. we used exhaustive psi-blast and tblastn searches across 774 bacterial genomes to identify homologs of known type i toxins. these searches substantially expanded the collection of predicted type i toxins, revealed homology of the ldr and fst toxins, and suggested that type i toxin-antitoxin loci are not spread by horizontal gene transfer. to discover novel type i toxin-antitoxin systems, we developed a set of search parameters based on characteristics of known loci including the presence of tandem repeats and clusters of charged and bulky amino acids at the c-termini of short proteins containing predicted transmembrane regions. we detected srnas for three predicted toxins from enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis, and showed  that two of the respective proteins indeed are toxic when overexpressed. we also  demonstrated that the local free-energy minima of rna folding can be used to detect the positions of the srna genes. our results suggest that type i toxin-antitoxin modules are much more widely distributed among bacteria than previously appreciated.

TI  == antibacterial activity of root canal filling materials for primary teeth: zinc oxide and eugenol cement, calen paste thickened with zinc oxide, sealapex and endorez.
AB  == this study evaluated in vitro the antibacterial activity of 4 root canal filling  materials for primary teeth - zinc oxide and eugenol cement (zoe), calen paste thickened with zinc oxide (calen/zo), sealapex sealer and endorez sealer - against 5 bacterial strains commonly found in endodontic infections (kocuria rhizophila, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus mutans, escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus) using the agar diffusion test (agar-well technique). calen paste, 1% chlorhexidine digluconate (chx) and distilled water served as controls. seven wells per dish were made at equidistant points and immediately filled with  the test and control materials. after incubation of the plates at 37 degrees c for 24 h, the diameter of the zones of bacterial growth inhibition produced around the wells was measured (in mm) with a digital caliper under reflected light. data were analyzed statistically by analysis of variance and tukey's post-hoc test (alpha=0.05). there were statistically significant differences (p<0.0001) among the zones of bacterial growth inhibition produced by the different materials against all target microorganisms. k. rhizophila was inhibited more effectively (p<0.05) by zoe, while calen/zo had its highest antibacterial activity against e. faecalis (p<0.05). s. mutans was inhibited by calen/zo, sealapex and zoe in the same intensity (p>0.05). e. coli was inhibited  more effectively (p<0.05) by zoe, followed by calen/zo and sealapex. calen/zo and zoe were equally effective (p>0.05) against s. aureus, while sealapex had the lowest antibacterial efficacy (p<0.05) against this microorganism. endorez presented antibacterial activity only against k. rhizophila and s. aureus. the calen paste and calen/zo produced larger zones of inhibition than 1% chx when the marker microorganism was e faecalis. in conclusion, the in vitro antibacterial activity of the 4 root canal filling materials for primary teeth against bacterial strains commonly found in endodontic infections can be presented in a decreasing order of efficacy as follows: zoe>calen/zo>sealapex>endorez.

TI  == infective endocarditis: identification of catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci  from blood cultures by partial 16s rrna gene analysis and by vitek 2 examination.
AB  == streptococci, enterococci and streptococcus-like bacteria are frequent etiologic  agents of infective endocarditis and correct species identification can be a laboratory challenge. viridans streptococci (vs) not seldomly cause contamination of blood cultures. vitek 2 and partial sequencing of the 16s rrna gene were applied in order to compare the results of both methods. strains originated from  two groups of patients: 149 strains from patients with infective endocarditis and 181 strains assessed as blood culture contaminants. of the 330 strains, based on  partial 16s rrna gene sequencing results, 251 (76%) were vs strains, 10 (3%) were pyogenic streptococcal strains, 54 (16%) were e. faecalis strains and 15 (5%) strains belonged to a group of miscellaneous catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci. among vs strains, respectively, 220 (87,6%) and 31 (12,3%) obtained agreeing and non-agreeing identifications with the two methods with respect to allocation to the same vs group. non-agreeing species identification mostly occurred among strains in the contaminant group, while for endocarditis strains notably fewer disagreeing results were observed.only 67 of 150 strains in the mitis group strains obtained identical species identifications by the two methods. most vs strains belonging to the groups of salivarius, anginosus, and mutans obtained agreeing species identifications with the two methods, while this only was the case for 13 of the 21 bovis strains. pyogenic strains (n=10), enterococcus faecalis strains (n=54) and a miscellaneous group of catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci (n=15) seemed well identified by both methods, except that disagreements in identifications in the miscellaneous group  of strains occurred for 6 of 15 strains.

AB  == this study evaluated the antibacterial effects of 4-acryloyloxyethyl trimellitate anhydride/methyl methacrylate-tri-n-butylborane (4-meta/mma-tbb) resin containing chlorhexidine (chx) digluconate. the chx was incorporated into the resins at varying concentrations from 0.0 (control) to 3.0%. the antibacterial effect of each resin against seven microorganisms was examined using agar diffusion tests.  growth inhibition of two streptococci was also tested in brain heart infusion (bhi) liquid broth containing each resin. release of chx was analyzed using hplc, and enamel and dentin bond strengths of each resin were measured. in the agar diffusion tests, growth of all the microorganisms was inhibited by the resin specimens containing chx at 1.0% or higher except for enterococcus faecalis. there was greater sensitivity in streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus  than in the other bacteria tested. complete growth inhibition of these two streptococci was observed in bhi liquid broth containing 1.0-1.5% or greater chx-incorporated resin. according to hplc analysis, 1.0% and 1.5% chx-containing  resins released means of 3.63 and 8.59 microg/ml of chx, respectively. specimens  with 0.5-1.5% and 0.5-2.0% chx exhibited no significant reduction in enamel and dentin bond strengths, respectively, when compared to the control (p > 0.05). this in vitro study suggested that incorporation of 1.0-1.5% chx digluconate into the 4-meta resin is optimal in terms of antibacterial effects and bond strength to the tooth.

TI  == comparative genomics and transduction potential of enterococcus faecalis temperate bacteriophages.
AB  == to determine the relative importance of temperate bacteriophage in the horizontal gene transfer of fitness and virulence determinants of enterococcus faecalis, a panel of 47 bacteremia isolates were treated with the inducing agents mitomycin c, norfloxacin, and uv radiation. thirty-four phages were purified from culture supernatants and discriminated using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and  restriction mapping. from these analyses the genomes of eight representative phages were pyrosequenced, revealing four distinct groups of phages. three groups of phages, phifl1 to 3, were found to be sequence related, with phifl1a to c and  phifl2a and b sharing the greatest identity (87 to 88%), while phifl3a and b share 37 to 41% identity with phifl1 and 2. phifl4a shares 3 to 12% identity with the phages phifl1 to 3. the phifl3a and b phages possess a high dna sequence identity with the morphogenesis and lysis modules of lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris prophages. homologs of the streptococcus mitis platelet binding phage tail proteins, pbla and pblb, are encoded on each sequenced e. faecalis phage. few other phage genes encoding potential virulence functions were identified, and there was little evidence of carriage of lysogenic conversion genes distal to endolysin, as has been observed with genomes of many temperate phages from the opportunist pathogens staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. e. faecalis jh2-2 lysogens were generated using the eight phages, and these were examined for their relative fitness in galleria mellonella. several lysogens exhibited different effects upon survival of g. mellonella compared to their isogenic parent. the eight phages were tested for their ability to package host dna, and three were shown to be very effective for generalized transduction of naive host cells of the laboratory strains og1rf and jh2-2.

TI  == photokilling of bacteria by curcumin in different aqueous preparations. studies on curcumin and curcuminoids xxxvii.
AB  == curcumin has potential as a photosensitiser (ps) in photodynamic therapy (pdt) for localised superficial infections. however, it is a challenge to make an optimal curcumin formulation in which curcumin has acceptable solubility and stability at physiological ph and combined with high selective phototoxic activity towards bacteria. in the present study, the phototoxic effects of curcumin against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria were investigated in selected aqueous preparations. the gram-positive enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus intermedius and the gram-negative escherichia coli were used as bacterial models. the bacteria were exposed to 1-25 microm curcumin solubilised in dmso, cyclodextrines, liposomes and surfactants known to interfere with membranes. after 30 min incubation the bacteria were irradiated with fluorescent  tubes emitting blue light (emission max 430 nm). the irradiance was 17 mw/cm2 and the radiant exposure (light dose) was 0.5-30j/cm2. the bacterial survival was calculated as a percentage compared to controls. various post-irradiation incubation times were tested. curcumin's native fluorescence was exploited in examination of curcumin uptake in or adherence to bacteria by fluorescence microscopy. changes in post-irradiation incubation time, curcumin concentration,  irradiation dose and preparation strongly influenced the phototoxic efficiency of curcumin in vitro. aqueous preparations of dmso, polyethyleneglycol and the pluronic block copolymer poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene glycol)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) were the most efficient vehicles for curcumin to exert photokilling of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == detecting related cases of bloodstream infections using time-interval distribution modelling.
AB  == an algorithm was designed to highlight related bloodstream infections using data  from a nosocomial infection surveillance system to help local public health authorities direct specific measures towards clusters of cases. the approach was  based on a two-step procedure. the first was a test to identify pathogens with an abnormal number of close cases. the second modelled, for the identified pathogens, the distribution of time intervals between successive cases as a mixture of two theoretical distributions in order to determine a threshold below  which a specific investigation is required. the algorithm was applied to bloodstream infection surveillance data collected during a 10-year period (1996-2005) in an 878-bed teaching hospital (24 wards) in lyon, france. the first step identified seven pathogens among the 18 being studied. the modelling succeeded in setting time thresholds to spot clusters of cases requiring further  investigation with defined sensitivity and specificity. setting the sensitivity level at 95%, the threshold values ranged from 24 days (acinetobacter baumannii)  to 294 days (enterobacter cloacae); the specificity was higher than 70% (up to 97.5% for a. baumannii) except for e. cloacae (52.1%). setting the specificity level at 95% resulted in a decrease in sensitivity except for a. baumannii (it reached nearly 100%); it fell below 50% for three pathogens: around 40% for streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis and 25% for enterobacter cloacae. the threshold values then ranged from 8 days (s. pneumoniae) to 67 days  (streptococcus pyogenes). the approach proved promising though further refinements are needed before routine use.

TI  == technology-induced selection towards the spoilage microbiota of artisan-type cooked ham packed under modified atmosphere.
AB  == the microbiota associated with a highly-perishable belgian artisan-type cooked ham was analyzed through plating and (gtg)(5)-fingerprinting of isolates throughout its processing chain. the raw tumbled meat was characterized by the presence of a versatile microbiota around 4.8 log(cfu g(-1)), consisting of lactic acid bacteria, staphylococci, brochothrix thermosphacta, gram-negative bacteria, and yeasts. pasteurisation of the ham logs reduced bacterial counts below 2 log(cfu g(-1)) and subsequent manipulations selected for leuconostocs and carnobacteria. also, b. thermosphacta and several enterobacteriaceae were found at this stage. during storage in an intermediate high-care area for 2 days, a selection towards certain enterobacteriaceae (hafnia alvei, enterobacter spp., and pantoea agglomerans) and lactic acid bacteria (mainly vagococci and streptococcus parauberis) was observed. b. thermosphacta, leuconostoc carnosum and carnobacteria were also detected, but only after allowing bacterial outgrowth by incubating the meat logs at 7 degrees c for four weeks. after a mild post-pasteurisation process and subsequent handling, incubation of the meat logs  at 7 degrees c for four weeks led to outgrowth of enterobacteriaceae (mainly enterobacter spp. and serratia spp.). b. thermosphacta, and lactic acid bacteria  (enterococcus faecalis, leuc. carnosum, and carnobacterium maltaromaticum) were also found. after slicing and packaging under modified atmosphere, the microbiota of the refrigerated end-product consisted of leuconostocs, carnobacteria, and b.  thermosphacta.

TI  == zyvox annual appraisal of potency and spectrum program: linezolid surveillance program results for 2008.
AB  == the seventh year of the zyvox annual appraisal of potency and spectrum program (2008) continues to monitor the in vitro activities of linezolid and comparator agents tested against gram-positive pathogens in latin america, europe, canada, and the asia-pacific region. linezolid is an oxazolidinone approved for the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium infections, complicated skin and soft tissue infections, and nosocomial pneumonia caused by various gram-positive species including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). surveillance isolates were submitted from 64 medical centers (24 countries) for a total of 6121 strains. each country was requested to send 200 consecutive isolates in 6 targeted pathogen categories to a central processing laboratory, except the united kingdom, japan, and china where more strains were processed (400, 400, and 800, respectively). reference broth microdilution susceptibility testing methods were used to test the following organism groups: s. aureus (3240), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (748), enterococci (864), streptococcus pneumoniae (655), viridans group (297), and beta-hemolytic streptococci (317). eight linezolid-resistant (lzd-r) isolates were detected in 7 countries (italy [2], france, china, brazil, sweden, germany, and united kingdom) among the enterococci (enterococcus faecalis [3] and e. faecium [2]) and cons (3  staphylococcus epidermidis). five lzd-r isolates contained 23s rrna mutations (g2576t or g2447t), and 2 strains had undeterminable resistance mechanisms. one cons (italy) contained the mobile cfr gene. vancomycin-resistant enterococci rates ranged from 0.0% in several countries to 59.4% in taiwan. all streptococci  were linezolid susceptible (mic(90), 1 microg/ml). in conclusion, the activity of linezolid remained uniform and stable across the sampled geographic regions studied when compared to the 2006 to 2007 results. documented lzd-r remains rare  (only 0.13% overall but highest for cons [0.41%] and enterococci [0.69%]) among the 24 countries sampled for the 6 different pathogen groups. rates of clindamycin resistance and the frequency of mrsa varied by geographic region and  between nations; therefore, like oxazolidinones, it requires continued surveillance for changing resistance patterns.

TI  == selective inhibitors of bacterial phosphopantothenoylcysteine synthetase.
AB  == bacterial phosphopantothenolycysteine synthetase (ppcs) catalyzes the formation of phosphopantothenoylcysteine (ppc) from (r)-phosphopantothenate, l-cysteine, and cytidine-5'-triphosphate (ctp) and has been shown to be essential for growth  and survival. the reaction proceeds through a phosphopantothenoyl cytidylate, mixed anhydride intermediate. both structural and kinetic characterization studies on ppcs have shown differences in the nucleobase binding site between the bacterial and human enzyme. we report for the first time the design and synthesis of mimics of the phosphopantothenoyl cytidylate, which proved to be potent inhibitors of ppcs. these compounds were evaluated in vitro against ppcs from human and several species of bacteria and showed marked selectivity (up to 1000-fold) toward the bacterial enzymes. a phosphodiester intermediate mimic was  the most potent of the compounds synthesized and displayed slow-onset, tight-binding kinetics toward e. faecalis ppcs.

TI  == requirement of the lactobacillus casei maekr two-component system for l-malic acid utilization via a malic enzyme pathway.
AB  == lactobacillus casei can metabolize l-malic acid via malolactic enzyme (malolactic fermentation [mlf]) or malic enzyme (me). whereas utilization of l-malic acid via mlf does not support growth, the me pathway enables l. casei to grow on l-malic acid. in this work, we have identified in the genomes of l. casei strains bl23 and atcc 334 a cluster consisting of two diverging operons, maepe and maekr, encoding a putative malate transporter (maep), an me (maee), and a two-component  (tc) system belonging to the citrate family (maek and maer). homologous clusters  were identified in enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus uberis. our results show that me is essential for l-malic acid utilization in l. casei. furthermore, deletion of either the gene encoding the histidine kinase or the response regulator of the tc system resulted in the loss of the ability to grow on l-malic acid, thus indicating that the cognate tc system regulates and is essential for the expression of me. transcriptional analyses showed that expression of maee is induced in the presence of l-malic acid and repressed by glucose, whereas tc system expression was induced by l-malic acid and was not repressed by glucose. dnase i footprinting analysis showed that maer binds specifically to a set of direct repeats [5'-ttatt(a/t)aa-3'] in the mae promoter region. the location of the repeats strongly suggests that maer activates the expression of the diverging operons maepe and maekr where the first one is also subjected to carbon catabolite repression.

TI  == [in vitro susceptibilities to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 12,919 clinical isolates obtained from 72 centers in 2007].
AB  == we have reported in this journal in vitro susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibiotics every year since 1992. in this paper, we report the results of an  analysis of in vitro susceptibilities of 12,919 clinical isolates from 72 centers in japan to selected antibiotics in 2007 compared with the results from previous  years. the common respiratory pathogens, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae maintained a high susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (fqs). the resistance of s. pyogenes to macrolides has been increasing every year and this was especially clear this year. most strains of enterobacteriaceae except for escherichia coli showed a high susceptibility to fqs. almost 30% of e. coli strains were resistant to fqs and the resistance increased further this year. fqs resistance of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was approximately 95% with the exception of 45% for sitafloxacin (stfx). fqs resistance of methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) was low at about 10%. fqs resistance of  methicillin-resistant coagulase negative staphylococci (mrcns) was higher than that of methicillin-susceptible coagulase negative staphylococci (mscns), but it  was lower than that of mrsa. however, fqs resistance of mscns was higher than that of mssa. fqs resistance of enterococcus faecalis was 22.5% to 29.6%, while that of enterococcusfaecium was more than 85% except for stfx (58.3%). in clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa derived from urinary tract infections, fqs resistance was 21-27%, which was higher than that of p. aeruginosa from respiratory tract infections at 13-21%, which was the same trend  as in past years. multidrug resistant strains accounted for 5.6% in the urinary tract and 1.8% in the respiratory tract. acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to fqs. the carbapenem resistant strains, which present a problem  at present, accounted for 2.7%. neisseria gonorrhoeae showed high resistance of 86-88% to fqs. the results of the present survey indicated that although methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococci, e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and n.  gonorrhoeae showed resistance tendencies, and other species maintained high susceptibility rates more than 90% against fqs, which have been used clinically for over 15 years.

TI  == in vitro activity of nemonoxacin (tg-873870), a novel non-fluorinated quinolone,  against clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus, enterococci and streptococcus pneumoniae with various resistance phenotypes in taiwan.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to assess the in vitro activities of nemonoxacin against gram-positive cocci with various resistance phenotypes. methods: mics of nemonoxacin were determined for 798 recently collected (2005-07) and non-duplicate isolates of gram-positive cocci by the agar dilution method. these isolates included: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa; n = 100); methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), including ciprofloxacin-susceptible (n = 50), ciprofloxacin-resistant (n = 100), vancomycin-intermediate (n = 50) and daptomycin-non-susceptible (dns-mrsa; n = 5) isolates, and community-acquired mrsa (ca-mrsa; n = 101); invasive streptococcus pneumoniae isolates (n = 150); levofloxacin-non-susceptible (mics of 4-64 mg/l) s. pneumoniae isolates (n = 30); and enterococci (n = 212), including vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre; n = 112). results: nemonoxacin had potent activity against mssa (mic(90) of < or =0.03 mg/l), ciprofloxacin-susceptible mrsa (mic(90) of < or =0.03 mg/l) and ca-mrsa (mic(90) of 0.06 mg/l). for all invasive s. pneumoniae isolates, the activity of nemonoxacin (mic(90) of 0.06 mg/l) was similar to that of gemifloxacin and much better than that of levofloxacin (mic(90) of 2 mg/l) and moxifloxacin (mic(90) of 0.25 mg/l). nemonoxacin had a 32- to 64-fold higher activity than levofloxacin against levofloxacin-non-susceptible isolates. nemonoxacin exerted limited activity against ciprofloxacin-resistant mrsa (mic(90) of 1 mg/l), vancomycin-intermediate mrsa (mic(90) of 2 mg/l), dns-mrsa (mic(90) of 1 mg/l), vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (mic(90) of 2 mg/l for enterococcus faecalis and 4 mg/l for enterococcus faecium) and vre (mic(90) of 4  mg/l for e. faecalis and 16 mg/l for e. faecium). conclusions: our findings point to a potentially useful role for nemonoxacin in the treatment of infections caused by mssa, ciprofloxacin-susceptible mrsa and s. pneumoniae with various resistance phenotypes.

TI  == the amidase domain of lipoamidase specifically inactivates lipoylated proteins in vivo.
AB  == background: in the 1950s, reed and coworkers discovered an enzyme activity in streptococcus faecalis (enterococcus faecalis) extracts that inactivated the escherichia. coli and e. faecalis pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes through cleavage of the lipoamide bond. the enzyme that caused this lipoamidase activity  remained unidentified until jiang and cronan discovered the gene encoding lipoamidase (lpa) through the screening of an expression library. subsequent cloning and characterization of the recombinant enzyme revealed that lipoamidase  is an 80 kda protein composed of an amidase domain containing a classic ser-ser-lys catalytic triad and a carboxy-terminal domain of unknown function. here, we show that the amidase domain can be used as an in vivo probe which specifically inactivates lipoylated enzymes. methodology/principal findings: we evaluated whether lpa could function as an inducible probe of alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase inactivation using e. coli as a model system. lpa expression resulted in cleavage of lipoic acid from the three lipoylated proteins expressed  in e. coli, but did not result in cleavage of biotin from the sole biotinylated protein, the biotin carboxyl carrier protein. when expressed in lipoylation deficient e. coli, lpa is not toxic, indicating that lpa does not interfere with  any other critical metabolic pathways. when truncated to the amidase domain, lpa  retained lipoamidase activity without acquiring biotinidase activity, indicating  that the carboxy-terminal domain is not essential for substrate recognition or function. substitution of any of the three catalytic triad amino acids with alanine produced inactive lpa proteins. conclusions/significance: the enzyme lipoamidase is active against a broad range of lipoylated proteins in vivo, but does not affect the growth of lipoylation deficient e. coli. lpa can be truncated to 60% of its original size with only a partial loss of activity, resulting in a  smaller probe that can be used to study the effects of alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase inactivation in vivo.

TI  == diagnodent laser fluorescence assessment of endodontic infection.
AB  == introduction: real-time assessment of the microbial status of the root canal system would be useful in clinical endodontic practice for determining endpoints  of biomechanical treatment. this laboratory study used an existing laser fluorescence device, the diagnodent (kavo, biberach, germany), in a proof-of-concept study. methods: visible laser red light (wavelength 655 nm) was  used to elicit fluorescence emissions in the near-infrared range from infected and uninfected root canals. a prototype sapphire tip designed for periodontal assessment was used to analyze the pulp chamber and coronal third of the root canal system in extracted teeth. the fluorescence properties of bacterial cultures, monospecies biofilms in root canals, pulpal soft tissues, and sound dentin were also evaluated, together with 50 extracted teeth with known endodontic pathology. results: sound dentin and healthy pulpal soft tissue gave an average fluorescence reading of 5 (on a scale of 100), whereas biofilms of enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus mutans established in root canals showed  a progressive increase in fluorescence over time. fluorescence readings reduced to the "healthy" threshold reading of 5 when root canals were endodontically treated, and the experimentally created bacterial biofilms were removed completely. high fluorescence readings were recorded in the root canals and pulp  chambers of extracted teeth with radiographic evidence of periapical pathology and scanning electron microscopy evidence of bacterial infection. conclusions: the use of the diagnodent fluorescence approach for the assessment of the status  of the pulp chamber and root canal system holds promise for clinical application; once more, flexible tips can be developed for gaining greater penetration into middle and apical thirds of the root canal.

TI  == comparative evaluation of antimicrobial activity of three cements: new endodontic cement (nec), mineral trioxide aggregate (mta) and portland.
AB  == using the agar diffusion method, we conducted an in vitro study to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of mineral trioxide aggregate (mta), new endodontic cement (nec) and portland cement at different concentrations against five different microorganisms. a base layer was made using muller-hinton agar for escherichia coli (atcc 10538) and candida (atcc 10231). for actinomyces viscosus (atcc 15987), enterococcus faecalis (atcc 10541) and streptococcus mutans (atcc 25175)  blood agar medium was used. wells were formed by removing the agar, and the materials were placed in the well immediately after manipulation. the plates were kept at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion, and then incubated at 37 degrees c for 72 h. the inhibition zones were then measured. the data were analyzed using anova and the tukey test to compare the differences among the three cements at different concentrations. the positive controls showed bacterial growth, while the negative controls showed no bacterial growth. all materials showed antimicrobial activity against the tested strains except for enterococcus  faecalis. nec created larger inhibition zones than mta and portland cement. this  difference was significant for portland cement (p < 0.05), but not for mta (p > 0.05). among the examined microorganisms, the largest inhibition zone was observed for actinomyces group (p < 0.05). the antimicrobial activity of the materials increased with time and concentration (p < 0.05). it was concluded that nec is a potent inhibitor of microorganism growth.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity profile of oritavancin against recent gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  == oritavancin activity was tested against 15,764 gram-positive isolates collected from 246 hospital centers in 25 countries between 2005 and 2008. organisms were staphylococcus aureus (n = 9,075), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 1,664),  enterococcus faecalis (n = 1,738), enterococcus faecium (n = 819), streptococcus  pyogenes (n = 959), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 415), group c, g, and f streptococci (n = 84), and streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1,010). among the evaluated staphylococci, 56.7% were resistant to oxacillin. the vancomycin resistance rate among enterococci was 21.2%. penicillin-resistant and -intermediate rates were 14.7% and 21.4%, respectively, among s. pneumoniae isolates. among nonpneumococcal streptococci, 18.5% were nonsusceptible to erythromycin. oritavancin showed substantial in vitro activity against all organisms tested, regardless of resistance profile. the maximum oritavancin mic against all staphylococci tested (n = 10,739) was 4 microg/ml; the mic(90) against s. aureus was 0.12 microg/ml. against e. faecalis and e. faecium, oritavancin mic(90)s were 0.06 and 0.12, respectively. oritavancin was active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci, including vana strains (n = 486), with mic(90)s of 0.25 and 1 microg/ml against vana e. faecium and e. faecalis, respectively. oritavancin showed potent activity against streptococci (n = 2,468); mic(90)s for the different streptococcal species were between 0.008 and 1 microg/ml. these data are consistent with previous studies with respect to resistance rates of gram-positive isolates and demonstrate the spectrum and in vitro activity of oritavancin against a wide variety of contemporary gram-positive pathogens, regardless of resistance to currently used drugs. the data provide a foundation for interpreting oritavancin activity and potential changes in susceptibility over time once oritavancin enters into clinical use.

TI  == influence of streptococcus mutans on enterococcus faecalis biofilm formation.
AB  == introduction: an important virulence factor of enterococcus faecalis is its ability to form biofilms. most studies on biofilm formation have been carried out by using e. faecalis monocultures. given the polymicrobial nature of root canal infections, it is important to understand biofilm formation of e. faecalis in the presence of other microorganisms. methods: eight clinical strains of e. faecalis  were tested for biofilm formation on hydroxyapatite disks in the presence and absence of a streptococcus mutans biofilm. results: significantly more e. faecalis viable cells were found in biofilms in the presence of s. mutans. this phenomenon was, however, strain-dependent. of the 8 strains tested, biofilm formation of strains aa-or34, er5/1, and v583 was not influenced by s. mutans biofilms. conclusions: the results from this study, especially the strain difference, underline the importance of studying biofilm formation in a more realistic multispecies setting.

TI  == contemporary root canal irrigants are able to disrupt and eradicate single- and dual-species biofilms.
AB  == introduction: clinical/microbiological studies have consistently revealed the persistence of some bacteria after conventional root canal debridement. although  this was originally attributed to the complexity of the root canal anatomy and the difficulty of delivering antibacterial agents effectively, it has emerged that the biofilm encasement of bacterial cells may confer a further mechanism of  resistance. the purpose of this study was to investigate the relative disruption  and bactericidal effects of root canal irrigants on single- and dual-species biofilms of root canal isolates. methods: biofilms of streptococcus sanguinis, enterococcus faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis were grown on nitrocellulose membranes for 72 hours and immersed in naocl, edta, chlorhexidine, and iodine for 1, 5, or 10 minutes. the number of viable and nonviable bacteria disrupted from the biofilm and those remaining adherent were determined by using a viability stain in conjunction with fluorescence microscopy. results: gram-negative obligate anaerobe species were more susceptible to cell removal than gram-positive facultative anaerobes. the majority of cells were disrupted after the first minute of exposure; however, the extent varied according to the agent and species. the most effective agent at disrupting biofilms was naocl. iodine was generally effective at bacterial killing but not disruption. conclusions: biofilm disruption and cell viability were influenced by the species, their coassociation in dual-species biofilms, the test agent, and the duration of exposure. the effectiveness of naocl as an endodontic irrigant was reinforced.

TI  == trends in udder health and emerging mastitogenic pathogens in south african dairy herds.
AB  == the aim of this study was to retrospectively analyse the results of milk samples  obtained from south african dairy herds during the period 1996 to april 2007 in order to identify possible trends in isolates of microorganisms and their pathogenicity under field conditions. milk samples were obtained from 7 of the 9  provinces in south africa where there are low numbers of dairy cows. although there is scientific limitation to a country wide survey, such as the variation in herd size, management skills, parity, milk yield, milking frequency and other parameters, the size of this database helps to give a fair indication of general  udder health in south africa. cytology and routine bacteriology were performed on 379,000 milk samples of lactating cows and bacteriology on 11,946 samples from non-lactating cows. according to the results obtained, mastitis did not decrease  in south africa over the test period. the prevalence of mastitis and teat canal infection was lowest in 2002. mastitis and teat canal infection increased from 2002 to 2006 from 8.1% and 24.1% to 15.4 and 30.0% respectively. the percentage of mastitogenic pathogens isolated from cows over these years also varied. previously unknown or almost eradicated mastitogenic pathogens such as alphabeta  haemolytic staphylococcus aureus which is thought to be of human origin, streptococcus agalactiae and enterococcus canis were responsible for numerous mastitis outbreaks seen in the test samples. coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most frequently isolated bacteria in milk samples from both lactating and dry cows, followed by staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae. although staphylococcus aureus remained the principal mastitogenic pathogen in south africa, owing to its chronic nature and resultant economic losses, most cases of mastitis were caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci. this finding increases the importance of coagulase-negative staphylococci (formerly described  as a minor pathogen) significantly. isolations of streptococcus agalactiae peaked between 2000 and 2005 and decreased again by 2007. coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates increased from 2002 and were still on the increase in 2007. streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus uberis and enterococcus canis were  isolated more frequently from milk samples of lactating cows compared with dry cows, while enterococcus faecalis was isolated more frequently from dry cow samples.

TI  == [in vitro activity of daptomycin and other antimicrobial agents against 499 strains of gram-positive cocci causing bloodstream infection].
AB  == objective: to evaluate the in vitro activity of daptomycin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, tigecycline, ceftobiprole and linezolid against 499 strains of blood-isolated gram-positive cocci. methods: determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration (mics) of daptomycin with microbrothdilution method and  the mics of other 9 antimicrobial agents with agar dilution method against 499 strains of blood-isolated gram positive cocci was carried out. the data was analyzed with whonet 5.4 software. results: the susceptibility rates of staphylococci to daptomycin, tigecycline, linezolid, ceftobiprole, vancomycin and teicoplanin were 100%. all staphylococcus strains were inhibited by daptomycin at a mic of 1 mg/l. the mic(50) and mic(90) of daptomycin were both 0.5 mg/l against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus coagulase-negative (mrscon). among enterococcus spp, the highest mic of daptomycin was 4 mg/l. the mic(50) and mic(90) of daptomycin were both 2 mg/l against e.faecalis, whereas they were 2 mg/l and 4 mg/l against e.faecium. one strains of linezolid-resistant e.faecalis (mic: 8 mg/l) was susceptible to daptomycin (mic: 1 mg/l). three strains of e.faecium carrying vana gene with vancomycin mics above 32 mg/l and teicoplanin mics also 32 mg/l were susceptible  to daptomycin, tigecycline and linezolid. the mic range of daptomycin against streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus viridans was 0.032 - 0.25 mg/l and 0.125 - 1.000 mg/l separately. conclusions: daptomycin has excellent in vitro activity against common gram-positive pathogens isolated from blood. it may be a  good choice for clinicians to treat drug-resistant gram-positive cocci.

TI  == increased d-lactic acid intestinal bacteria in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome.
AB  == patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (cfs) are affected by symptoms of cognitive dysfunction and neurological impairment, the cause of which has yet to  be elucidated. however, these symptoms are strikingly similar to those of patients presented with d-lactic acidosis. a significant increase of gram positive facultative anaerobic faecal microorganisms in 108 cfs patients as compared to 177 control subjects (p<0.01) is presented in this report. the viable count of d-lactic acid producing enterococcus and streptococcus spp. in the faecal samples from the cfs group (3.5 x 10(7) cfu/l and 9.8 x 10(7) cfu/l respectively) were significantly higher than those for the control group (5.0 x 10(6) cfu/l and 8.9 x 10(4) cfu/l respectively). analysis of exometabolic profiles of enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus sanguinis, representatives of enterococcus and streptococcus spp. respectively, by nmr and hplc showed that these organisms produced significantly more lactic acid (p<0.01) from (13)c-labeled glucose, than the gram negative escherichia coli. further, both e.  faecalis and s. sanguinis secrete more d-lactic acid than e. coli. this study suggests a probable link between intestinal colonization of gram positive facultative anaerobic d-lactic acid bacteria and symptom expressions in a subgroup of patients with cfs. given the fact that this might explain not only neurocognitive dysfunction in cfs patients but also mitochondrial dysfunction, these findings may have important clinical implications.

TI  == molecular analysis of persistent periradicular lesions and root ends reveals a diverse microbial profile.
AB  == introduction: the microbial etiology of periradicular lesions is recognized; however, the bacterial profile of these lesions is not well elucidated. the purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of bacterial colonization in these lesions and to characterize the bacterial community present in root ends and periradicular lesions. methods: thirty-four adult patients who presented for  apicoectomy of persistent periradicular lesions after endodontic therapy were selected for the study and samples of periradicular tissue and resected root ends collected. total bacterial levels were estimated for 34 paired periradicular lesions and root ends using real-time polymerase chain reaction with universal bacterial primers. sixteen pairs of these samples were analyzed using ribosomal 16s cloning and sequencing for bacterial identification. results: bacteria were detected more consistently and at higher levels in root ends. periradicular lesions exhibited a diverse microbial profile with many uncultivated phylotypes.  enterococcus faecalis and burkholderia cepacia predominated in both samples. campylobacter gracilis and streptococcus gordonii were associated with root ends, whereas atopobium rimae, peptostreptococcus micros, streptococcus genomospecies c8, dialister sp e2_20 e1, and eubacterium strain a35mt were associated with periradicular lesions. conclusions: persistent periradicular lesions are polymicrobial infections with many as-yet-uncultivated and unknown bacterial species. the bacterial load and microbial profile of root ends is significantly different from the soft-tissue lesion, indicating the presence of diverse bacterial populations in these tissues.

TI  == [investigation of the situation of vaginal microflora in healthy women population].
AB  == objective: to assess the distribution of vaginal microflora in healthy women and  investigate their cognition of lower reproductive tract infection-related knowledge as well as personal hygiene habits and character of behavior in seeking medical treatment. methods: total of 1660 healthy women who had physical check-ups at the medical center of renji hospital were selected and received gynecologic examination, as well as routine examination, ph examination and bacterial culture of the vaginal discharge. in addition, 860 of them were randomly selected for questionnaire survey, in which reproductive tract infection -related knowledge and personal hygiene habits as well as behavior in seeking medical treatment were involved. results: among the 1660 censused women, vaginal  average ph was 4. 16 +/- 0.21. the positive rate of candida in vaginal discharge  routine examination was 3.86% (64/1660), which was lower than that in aerobes culture 7.71% (128/1660). candida albicans was the most populous species 78.9% (101/128), followed by 7.8% (10/128) and 7.0% (9/128) for the candida glabrata and candida krusei respectively. the most populous species of vaginal microflora  were hemolytic streptococcus a (63.80%, 1059/1660), staphylococcus epidermidis (14.28%, 237/1660), and enterococcus faecalis (d) group (11.44%, 190/1660). the questionnaire survey showed that 88.4% (760/860) of 860 women took active treatment when feeling unwell, 92.1% (792/860) of them had good hygiene practices, and only 21.2% (182/860) had the habit of vaginal douching. in addition, 50.0% (430/860) of them had the desire to obtain reproductive health knowledge through out-patient consultation. conclusions: vulvovaginal candida disease ranks the first in all types of vaginitis, among which, candida albicans  is the most populous species followed by the candida glabrata and candida krusei. hemolytic streptococcus a and staphylococcus epidermidis are the most common species of vaginal microflora in healthy women. the censused women have high awareness of reproductive health care and pay much attention to common gynecologic diseases such as lower reproductive tract infection. nevertheless, we should strengthen the public education of reproductive health-related knowledge.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo properties of dihydrophthalazine antifolates, a novel family of antibacterial drugs.
AB  == racemic 2,4-diaminopyrimidine dihydrophthalazine derivatives bal0030543, bal0030544, and bal0030545 exhibited low in vitro mics toward small, selected panels of enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae,  moraxella catarrhalis, and mycobacterium avium, though the compounds were less active against haemophilus influenzae. the constellation of dihydrofolate reductases (dhfrs) present in 20 enterococci and 40 staphylococci was analyzed and correlated with the antibacterial activities of the dihydrophthalazines and trimethoprim. dhfrs encoded by dfrb, dfra (s1 isozyme), dfre, and fola were susceptible to the dihydrophthalazines, whereas dhfrs encoded by dfrg (s3 isozyme) and dfrf were not. studies with the separated enantiomers of bal0030543, bal0030544, and bal0030545 revealed preferential inhibition of susceptible dhfrs  by the (r)-enantiomers. bal0030543, bal0030544, and bal0030545 were well tolerated by mice during 5- and 10-day oral toxicity studies at doses of up to 400 mg/kg of body weight. using a nonoptimized formulation, the dihydrophthalazines displayed acceptable oral bioavailabilities in mice, and efficacy studies with a septicemia model of mice infected with trimethoprim-resistant, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus gave 50% effective dose values in the range of 1.6 to 6.25 mg/kg.

TI  == resistance to bacitracin in streptococcus pyogenes from oropharyngeal colonization and noninvasive infections in portugal was caused by two clones of distinct virulence genotypes.
AB  == during 2000-2007 in lisbon, we identified 45 bacitracin-resistant streptococcus pyogenes isolates among 1629 isolates: 24 from oropharyngeal healthy carriers (out of 1026), 21 from patients with noninvasive infections (out of 559) and zero from invasive infections (out of 44). forty-four of those isolates, mainly of colonization, are low-level bacitracin-resistant members of the cmls(b)-macrolide-resistant and tetracycline-susceptible emm28/st52 clone previously detected in europe, but only among clinical samples. one high-level bacitracin-resistant isolate, associated with a tonsillitis/pharyngitis episode,  is cmls(b)-macrolide-resistant and tetracycline-resistant member of the emm74/st120 lineage, which was not previously known to include bacitracin-resistant isolates. the bcrabdr operon encoding an atp-binding cassette transporter in enterococcus faecalis was not detected among these bacitracin-resistant s. pyogenes strains. virulence profiling indicated that genes coding for exotoxins and superantigens seem to be clone specific. this study provides an increased knowledge about specific bacitracin-resistant s. pyogenes strains, which may be useful in future investigations aiming to understand the mechanism(s) leading to bacitracin resistance and the cause(s) for differences in colonization and/or dissemination potential.

TI  == characterisation of thermotolerant cocci from indigenous flora of 'leben' in algerian arid area and dna identification of atypical lactococcus lactis strains.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are widely used in food industry and their growth performance is important for the quality of the fermented product. by combining results from conventional isolation methods and molecular investigation of 16s rrna gene and lactococcal/enterococcal specific genes, we identify at species level catalase negative gram positive thermoresistant cocci isolated from traditional 'leben', a 24-h fermented milk in arid area of west algeria. forty strains phenotypically related to cocci lab were identified as belonging to the species lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and other enterococcus species. no streptococcus thermophilus strain was isolated. ten different phenotype groups were recognized, and the species content of these groups were in some cases different from the expected features usually given in genus and species descriptions. in particular, atypical lactococci, able to grow in 6.5% nacl, at ph 9.5 and showing high resistance to thermal stresses were isolated. lactococci, but also enterococci isolated from traditional 'leben' produced in the desert area, may be therefore of interest in milk fermentation. further studies to assess this source of diversity within the wild microbial population should provide starter new strains for product innovation.

TI  == a dna array based assay for the characterization of microbial community in raw milk.
AB  == an oligonucleotide array based on pcr method containing a combination of probes for taxonomic markers and species-specific virulence genes was developed for the  simultaneous identification of 14 lactic acid bacteria (lab) and food-borne pathogenic bacteria in raw milk. the hypervariable regions v3 and v6 of 16s, together with a variable region of 23s rrna genes and several genes specific for  virulence factors were selected. universal primers and multiplex pcr were used for the rapid differentiation of bacterial species and low concentration of specific pathogenic and spoilage bacteria were detected in milk. the dominant species such as streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecalis, lactococcus lactis, andleuconostoc lactis were identified by indirect-labelling reactions based upon incorporation of amino-allyl dutps. the results regarding food-borne pathogens detection showed highly specific hybridisation patterns with the genomic dna from campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, salmonella thyphimurium, listeria monocytogenes and yersinia enterocolitica. a clear differentiation of dominant species present in a complex microbial community such as raw milk was achieved by the application of short oligonucleotide probes which discriminate sequences differing by few nucleotides.

TI  == microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina of transsexual women.
AB  == background: the microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina in male-to-female transsexuals is a recently created microbial niche which thus far has been characterized only to a very limited extent. yet the knowledge of this microflora can be considered as essential to the follow-up of transsexual women. the primary objective of this study was to map the neo-vaginal microflora in a group of 50 transsexual women for whom a neovagina was constructed by means of the inverted penile skin flap technique. secondary objectives were to describe possible correlations of this microflora with multiple patients' characteristics, such as  sexual orientation, the incidence of vaginal irritation and malodorous vaginal discharge. results: based on gram stain the majority of smears revealed a mixed microflora that had some similarity with bacterial vaginosis (bv) microflora and  that contained various amounts of cocci, polymorphous gram-negative and gram-positive rods, often with fusiform and comma-shaped rods, and sometimes even with spirochetes. candida cells were not seen in any of the smears. on average 8.6 species were cultured per woman. the species most often found were: staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus anginosus group spp., enterococcus faecalis, corynebacterium sp., mobiluncus curtisii and bacteroides ureolyticus. lactobacilli were found in only one of 30 women. there was no correlation between dilatation habits, having coitus, rinsing habits and malodorous vaginal discharge on the one hand and the presence of a particular species on the other. there was  however a highly significant correlation between the presence of e. faecalis on the one hand and sexual orientation and coitus on the other (p = 0.003 and p = 0.027 respectively). respectively 82%, 58% and 30% of the samples showed an amplicon after amplification with m. curtisii, atopobium vaginae and gardnerella  vaginalis primer sets. conclusion: our study is the first to describe the microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina of transsexual women. it reveals a  mixed microflora of aerobe and anaerobe species usually found either on the skin, in the intestinal microflora or in a bv microflora.

TI  == combination of 10% edta, photosan, and a blue light hand-held photopolymerizer to inactivate leading oral bacteria in dentistry in vitro.
AB  == aims: the goal of this study was to investigate the phototoxicity of photosan in  combination with edta and a hand-held photopolymerizer used in dentistry for light-curing resins against leading key pathogens in caries, endodontic treatment failures, and periodontitis respectively. methods and results: cellular uptake of photosan was detected by fluorescence spectroscopy for streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis but not for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. addition of 10% edta enabled the uptake of photosan by a. actinomycetemcomitans. killing of s. mutans and e. faecalis mediated by photosan and blue light was concentration and light dose dependent, achieving a >or=99.9% (>or=3 log(10) reduction) efficacy of bacteria killing. in the presence of 10% edta, photosan induced a reduction of >or=4 log(10) in the viability of a. actinomycetemcomitans at a concentration of 50 microg ml(-1), upon activation at a dose of 9.65 j cm(-2) for 60 s. edta alone, light alone, and photosan alone were not able to kill bacteria. conclusions: ten per cent edta and photosan cause a potent phototoxicity against oral bacteria upon illumination with a photopolymerizer. significance and impact of the study: increasing antibiotic resistance and insufficient drug concentrations within the sulcus fluid are responsible for lacking antimicrobial efficacy. this study provides useful information that combination of photosan, edta, and a photopolymerizer may be a potentially powerful tool for the efficient destroying of key oral bacteria.

TI  == ceftaroline: a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == ceftaroline is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin currently under clinical investigation for the treatment of complicated skin and skin-structure infections (csssi), including those caused by meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), and community-acquired pneumonia (cap). ceftaroline has the ability to bind to penicillin-binding protein (pbp)2a, an mrsa-specific pbp that has low affinity for most other beta-lactam antibacterials. the high binding affinity of  ceftaroline to pbp2a (median inhibitory concentration 0.90 microg/ml) correlates  well with its low minimum inhibitory concentration for mrsa. ceftaroline is active in vitro against gram-positive cocci, including mrsa, meticillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (not e. faecium). the broad-spectrum activity of ceftaroline includes many gram-negative pathogens but does not extend to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing or ampc-derepressed enterobacteriaceae or most nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli. ceftaroline demonstrates limited activity against anaerobes such as bacteroides fragilis and  non-fragilis bacteroides spp. limited data show that ceftaroline has a low propensity to select for resistant subpopulations. ceftaroline fosamil (prodrug)  is rapidly converted by plasma phosphatases to active ceftaroline. for multiple intravenous doses of 600 mg given over 1 h every 12 hours for 14 days, the maximum plasma concentration was 19.0 microg/ml and 21.0 microg/ml for first and  last dose, respectively. ceftaroline has a volume of distribution of 0.37 l/kg (28.3 l), low protein binding (<20%) and a serum half-life of 2.6 hours. no drug  accumulation occurs with multiple doses and elimination occurs primarily through  renal excretion (49.6%). based on monte carlo simulations, dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-50 ml/min); no adjustment is needed for mild renal impairment. currently, limited clinical trial data are available for ceftaroline. a phase ii study randomized 100 patients with csssi to intravenous ceftaroline 600 mg every 12 hours or intravenous vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours with or without intravenous aztreonam 1 g every 8 hours (standard therapy) for 7-14 days. clinical cure rates were 96.7% for ceftaroline compared with 88.9% for standard therapy. adverse events were similar between groups and generally mild in nature. in a phase iii trial, 702 patients with csssi were randomized to ceftaroline 600 mg or vancomycin 1 g plus aztreonam 1 g, each administered intravenously every 12 hours for 5-14 days. ceftaroline was noninferior to vancomycin plus aztreonam in treating csssi caused by both gram-positive and -negative pathogens. adverse event rates were similar between groups. ceftaroline is well tolerated, which is  consistent with the good safety and tolerability profile of the cephalosporin class. in summary, ceftaroline is a promising treatment for csssi and cap, and has potential to be used as monotherapy for polymicrobial infections because of its broad-spectrum activity. further clinical studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of ceftaroline, and to define its role in patient care.

TI  == combinatorial expression of bacterial whole mevalonate pathway for the production of beta-carotene in e. coli.
AB  == the increased synthesis of building blocks of ipp (isopentenyl diphosphate) and dmapp (dimethylallyl diphosphate) through metabolic engineering is a way to enhance the production of carotenoids. using e. coli as a host, ipp and dmapp supply can be increased significantly through the introduction of foreign mva (mevalonate) pathway into it. the mva pathway is split into two parts with the top and bottom portions supplying mevalonate from acetyl-coa, and ipp and dmapp from mevalonate, respectively. the bottom portions of mva pathway from streptococcus pneumonia, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and saccharomyces cerevisiae were compared with exogenous  mevalonate supplementation for beta-carotene production in recombinant escherichia coli harboring beta-carotene synthesis genes. the e. coli harboring the bottom mva pathway of s. pneumoniae produced the highest amount of beta-carotene. the top portions of mva pathway were also compared and the top mva pathway of e. faecalis was found out to be the most efficient for mevalonate production in e. coli. the whole mva pathway was constructed by combining the bottom and top portions of mva pathway of s. pneumoniae and e. faecalis, respectively. the recombinant e. coli harboring the whole mva pathway and beta-carotene synthesis genes produced high amount of beta-carotene even without  exogenous mevalonate supplementation. when comparing various e. coli strains - mg1655, dh5alpha, s17-1, xl1-blue and bl21 - the dh5alpha was found to be the best beta-carotene producer. using glycerol as the carbon source for beta-carotene production was found to be superior to glucose, galactose, xylose and maltose. the recombinant e. coli dh5alpha harboring the whole mva pathway and beta-carotene synthesis genes produced beta-carotene of 465mg/l at glycerol concentration of 2% (w/v).

TI  == tgf-beta1 inhibits tlr-mediated odontoblast responses to oral bacteria.
AB  == tgf-beta1 exerts diverse functions in tooth development and tissue repair, but its role in microbial defenses of the tooth is not well-understood. odontoblasts  extending their cellular processes into the dentin are the first cells to recognize signals from tgf-beta1 and bacteria in carious dentin. this study aimed to determine the role of tgf-beta1 in modulating odontoblast responses to oral bacteria. we show that these responses depend upon the expression levels of microbial recognition receptors tlr2 and tlr4 on the cell surface. porphyromonas  gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum activated both tlrs, but tlr4 played a greater role. lack of cell-surface tlr2 was associated with poor response to streptococcus mutans, enterococcus faecalis, and lactobacillus casei. tgf-beta1 inhibited tlr2 and tlr4 expression and attenuated  odontoblast responses. our findings suggest that the balance between tlr-mediated inflammation and tgf-beta1 anti-inflammatory activity plays an important role in  pulpal inflammation.

TI  == rhodomyrtone: a new candidate as natural antibacterial drug from rhodomyrtus tomentosa.
AB  == rhodomyrtone [6,8-dihydroxy-2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-7-(3-methyl-1-oxobutyl)-9-(2-methylpropyl)-4,9 -dihydro-1h-xanthene-1,3(2h)-di-one] from rhodomyrtus tomentosa (aiton) hassk. displayed significant antibacterial activities against gram-positive bacteria including bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus salivarius. especially noteworthy was the activity against mrsa with a minimum inhibitory concentration  (mic) and a minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) ranging from 0.39 to 0.78 microg/ml. as shown for s. pyogenes, no surviving cells were detected within 5 and 6h after treatment with the compound at 8mbc and 4mbc concentrations, respectively. rhodomyrtone displays no bacteriolytic activity, as determined by measurement of the optical density at 620 nm. a rhodomyrtone killing test with s. mutans using phase contrast microscopy showed that this compound caused a few morphological changes as the treated cells were slightly changed in color and bigger than the control when they were killed. taken together, the results support the view that rhodomyrtone has a strong bactericidal activity on gram-positive bacteria, including major pathogens.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of doripenem tested against prevalent gram-positive pathogens: results from a global surveillance study (2003-2007).
AB  == doripenem is a broad-spectrum parenteral carbapenem recently approved in the united states for treatment of complicated urinary tract and intra-abdominal infections. although pronounced doripenem antimicrobial activity against various  gram-negative pathogens, including anaerobes, has been confirmed, limited information has been forthcoming on the activity of this agent against leading gram-positive species. we evaluated the activity of doripenem using reference broth microdilution procedures against a large collection of staphylococci, enterococci, and streptococci collected as part of a global (north america, 43.0%; latin america, 11.7%; europe, 31.3%; and asia-pacific, 14.0%) doripenem surveillance program for the years 2003 to 2007. doripenem was confirmed to be highly active against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (22 389 isolates) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (2444 isolates; mic(90) values, <or=0.06 microg/ml), with no differences noted between geographic regions. against enterococcus faecalis (8714 isolates), doripenem displayed modest activity (mic(50), 4 microg/ml) but was largely inactive against enterococcus faecium (4233 isolates). although not currently approved for treatment of respiratory tract infections in the united states, doripenem was highly active against streptococcus pneumoniae (10 260 isolates; mic(90), 0.5 microg/ml) and 2-fold more active than either ceftriaxone or cefepime. doripenem activity was even more noteworthy against beta-hemolytic streptococci (4598 isolates; mic(90), <or=0.06 microg/ml, similar to that of penicillin) and viridans group streptococci (1887 isolates; mic(90), 0.25 microg/ml). doripenem appears broadly  active in vitro against gram-positive pathogens, a potency similar to that of other carbapenems, a distinct advantage that complements other attributes including beta-lactamase and dehydropeptidase stability and activity against emerging multidrug-resistant gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == the antimicrobial effect of acetic acid--an alternative to common local antiseptics?
AB  == acetic acid has been commonly used in medicine for more than 6000 years for the disinfection of wounds and especially as an antiseptic agent in the treatment and prophylaxis of the plague. the main goal of this study was to prove the suitability of acetic acid, in low concentration of 3%, as a local antiseptic agent, especially for use in salvage procedures in problematic infections caused  by organisms such as proteus vulgaris, acinetobacter baumannii or pseudomonas aeruginosa. this study was designed to compare the in vitro antimicrobial effect  of acetic acid with those of common local antiseptics such as povidone-iodine 11% (betaisodona), polyhexanide 0.04% (lavasept), mafenide 5% and chlohexidine gluconate 1.5% cetrimide 15% (hibicet). former studies suggest the bactericidal effect of acetic acid, but these data are very heterogeneous; therefore, a standardised in vitro study was conducted. to cover the typical bacterial spectrum of a burn unit, the following gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial  strains were tested: escherichia coli, p. vulgaris, p. aeruginosa, a. baumannii,  enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and beta-haemolytic streptococcus group a and b. the tests showed excellent bactericidal effect of acetic acid, particularly with problematic gram-negative bacteria such as p. vulgaris, p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii. the microbiological spectrum of acetic acid is wide, even when tested  at a low concentration of 3%. in comparison to our currently used antiseptic solutions, it showed similar - in some bacteria, even better - bactericidal properties. an evaluation of the clinical value of topical application of acetic  acid is currently underway. it can be concluded that acetic acid in a concentration of 3% has excellent bactericidal effect and, therefore, seems to be suitable as a local antiseptic agent, but further clinical studies are necessary.

TI  == community-acquired bacterial meningitis in elderly patients: experience over 30 years.
AB  == clinical characteristics, etiologies, evolution, and prognostic factors of community-acquired bacterial meningitis in elderly patients are not well known. to improve this knowledge, all episodes of community-acquired bacterial meningitis were prospectively recorded and cases occurring in patients >or=65 years old were selected. during the period 1977-2006, 675 episodes in adults (aged >or=18 yr) were recorded, with 185 (27%) in patients aged >or=65 years old; 76 were male and 109 were female, with a mean age of 73 +/- 6 years (range, 65-93 yr). causative microorganisms were streptococcus pneumoniae 74, neisseria meningitidis 49, listeria monocytogenes 17, other streptococcal 9, escherichia coli 6, haemophilus influenzae 4, klebsiella pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus 2 each, capnocytophaga canimorsus and enterococcus faecalis 1 each, and unknown in 20. on admission 91% had had fever, 32% were in a coma (glasgow coma scale <or=8), 9% presented with seizures, and 8% with shock. thirty patients (16%) presented with seizures during therapy. mortality was 58/185 (31%). compared with patients aged 18-65 years, there were significant differences among older patients (aged >or=65 yr), who showed a higher frequency of diabetes and malignancy as underlying disease; pneumonia, otitis, and pericranial fistula as predisposing factors; and s. pneumoniae and l. monocytogenes as etiology. there were also differences in clinical presentation, complications, sequelae, and mortality. factors independently related with mortality were age, pneumonia as a  predisposing factor, coma on admission, and heart failure and seizures after therapy. dexamethasone therapy was a protective factor. in conclusion, bacterial  meningitis in elderly patients is associated with greater diagnostic difficulties and neurologic severity and more complications, as well as with increased mortality. antiseizure prophylaxis might be useful in these patients.

TI  == spectrum of activity and mode of action of rep3123, a new antibiotic to treat clostridium difficile infections.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to characterize the antimicrobial profile of rep3123, a novel inhibitor of methionyl-trna synthetase (metrs) in development for the treatment of clostridium difficile infection. methods: the spectrum of activity of rep3123 was determined by susceptibility testing of c. difficile and  non-target organisms. the mode of action was studied by enzyme inhibition assays, macromolecular synthesis assays, target overexpression and selection of spontaneous resistant mutants. results: rep3123 was active against a collection of 108 clinical isolates of c. difficile and against epidemic, moxifloxacin-resistant bi/nap1/027 strains (mic range=0.5-1 mg/l and mic(90) = 1  mg/l). the spectrum of activity included clinically important aerobic gram-positive cocci such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium (mic(90)s < 1 mg/l), but rep3123 was not active against most gram-negative bacteria. rep3123 targeted c. difficile metrs with a calculated inhibition constant (k(i)) of 0.020 nm, and selectivity was >1000-fold over human mitochondrial and cytoplasmic metrs. the specific mode  of action within bacterial cells was demonstrated by macromolecular synthesis assays that showed inhibition of protein synthesis by rep3123, and by mets overexpression, which resulted in a 16-fold increase in mic for rep3123. spontaneous rep3123-resistant mutants of c. difficile (mics, 4-128 mg/l) arose with frequencies of 10(-8)-10(-9) and harboured distinct point mutations within the mets gene, resulting in 13 different amino acid substitutions. most of the metrs substitutions caused reduced catalytic efficiency and a growth fitness burden. conclusions: rep3123 demonstrated a favourable microbiological profile and was found to target c. difficile with high specificity and selectivity.

TI  == 1h-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy for identifying and quantifying common uropathogens: a metabolic approach to the urinary tract infection.
AB  == objective: to address the shortcomings of urine culture for the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (uti), we used 1h-nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectroscopy for identifying and quantifying escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia and proteus mirabilis. patients, subjects and methods: urine samples from patients with suspected uti (617), healthy volunteers (50) and commercially available standard strains of e. coli, k. pneumonia, p. aeruginosa, enterobacter, acinobacter, pr. mirabilis, citrobacter frundii, streptococcus saprophyticus and enterococcus faecalis were assessed between 2003  and 2006. 1h-nmr spectra were recorded on a 400 mhz spectrophotometer; to quantify the bacteria we estimated the areas under the spectral peaks of the specific metabolic product compared with the known concentration of trimethyl silyl propionic acid. all urine specimens were cultured in addition to an assessment by nmr spectroscopy. results: preliminary urinary spectroscopy of the  unprocessed samples showed peaks of nonspecific metabolites such as succinate, acetate, lactate and ethanol, indicating infected samples. based on the results from processed samples, 93% (240/256) of e. coli, 92% (101/110) of k. pneumoniae, 93% (56/60) of p. aeruginosa and eight of 10 pr. mirabilis could be diagnosed with nmr (numerator) and urine culture (denominator). the remaining samples were  sterile and/or had a bacterial population of <10(3) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. the nmr method diagnosed bacterial densities of >10(3) cfu. conclusions: the identification of the common uropathogens e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa and pr. mirabilis by nmr spectroscopy has a shorter reporting time and can be used to differentiate between infected, contaminated and sterile specimens.

TI  == study of microbial diversity in raw milk and fresh curd used for fontina cheese production by culture-independent methods.
AB  == the bacterial populations of raw milk employed for the production of fontina cheese in alpine farms located in different valleys and altitudes (from 700 to 2246 m above sea level) were investigated by culture independent techniques. total microbial dna was isolated from milk and curd samples and used as template  in polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to study the hypervariable v3 region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene and analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). representative bands of dgge patterns were sequenced for identification purposes. the use of universal primer for pcr-dgge allowed the description of the bacterial community, not only for the presence of lactic acid bacteria, but also  for other adventitious species. dgge profiles obtained from milk and fresh curd samples were generally different and typical for each farm, although some recurrent bands were observed. cluster analysis of dgge profiles did not show high similarity among samples and it was probably dependent on the different geographical areas of pastures. some lactic acid bacteria (lab) recurred in many  samples (streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc lactis) indicating that alpine milk is a preferential niche for their colonization. the microbiota included not only mesophilic and thermoresistant lab but also adventitious bacteria (macrococcus caseolyticus, rothia spp.) and psychrotrophic bacteria (chryseobacterium spp., pseudomonas spp.), that were found in almost all samples, but disappeared after the warming up at 47-48 degrees c of coagulated milk. pantoea spp. was primarily  found in curds and only with a low incidence in milk samples, indicating the environmental origin. finally the sequencing data confirmed the presence of e. faecium, e. faecalis and s. thermophilus as major species present in the curd. these species were found also in raw milk, proving its importance as source of the typical fermenting microflora.

TI  == tr-700 in vitro activity against and resistance mutation frequencies among gram-positive pathogens.
AB  == background: tr-700, the active component of the oxazolidinone prodrug tr-701, has demonstrated potent activity against numerous gram-positive species. in this study, single-step mutation frequencies, passaging and the activity of tr-700 were tested against a worldwide collection of linezolid-non-susceptible organisms and matched controls. methods: one hundred and twenty linezolid-non-susceptible and 120 controls matched by genus/species, geographic origin, site of infection and time were susceptibility tested by reference broth microdilution methods. species of isolates were: enterococcus faecalis (16 linezolid non-susceptible/16  wild-type strains); enterococcus faecium (55/55), staphylococcus aureus (8/8); coagulase-negative staphylococci (at least 7 spp., 40/40) and viridans group streptococci (2 spp., 1/1). 23s rrna target mutations or cfr genes were detected  by pcr and sequencing. results: among linezolid-non-susceptible strains, the resistance mechanisms were g2576t (109), cfr (4) and unknown (7), with strains originating from europe, far east and north and south america. most strains were  multidrug-resistant and cfr isolates exhibited co-resistance to phenicols, clindamycin, linezolid, pleuromutilins and streptogramin b. tr-700 mic values, regardless of species, were 4-32-fold lower than those of linezolid. tr-700 mic results were < or = 4, < or = 8 or < or = 16 mg/l for 88%, 96% and > 99% of linezolid-non-susceptible strains, respectively. spontaneous single-step mutations were undetected (<1.1 x 10(-9)) and 14 day passaging studies produced modest tr-700 mic elevations compared with linezolid controls. conclusions: tr-700 exhibited enhanced activity against linezolid-non-susceptible and wild-type control strains of gram-positive cocci. a significant number (nearly 90%) of linezolid-non-susceptible strains were inhibited by potentially achievable levels (< or = 4 mg/l) of tr-700. all strains with the emerging cfr-mediated resistance determinant had tr-700 mic results at < or = 8 mg/l.

TI  == structural studies of the enterococcus faecalis sufu [fe-s] cluster protein.
AB  == background: iron-sulfur clusters are ubiquitous and evolutionarily ancient inorganic prosthetic groups, the biosynthesis of which depends on complex protein machineries. three distinct assembly systems involved in the maturation of cellular fe-s proteins have been determined, designated the nif, isc and suf systems. although well described in several organisms, these machineries are poorly understood in gram-positive bacteria. within the firmicutes phylum, the enterococcus spp. genus have recently assumed importance in clinical microbiology being considered as emerging pathogens for humans, wherein enterococcus faecalis  represents the major species associated with nosocomial infections. the aim of this study was to carry out a phylogenetic analysis in enterococcus faecalis v583 and a structural and conformational characterisation of it sufu protein. results: blast searches of the enterococcus genome revealed a series of genes with sequence similarity to the escherichia coli suf machinery of [fe-s] cluster biosynthesis, namely sufb, sufc, sufd and sufs. in addition, the e. coli iscu ortholog sufu was found to be the scaffold protein of enterococcus spp., containing all features considered essential for its biological activity, including conserved amino acid residues involved in substrate and/or co-factor binding (cys50,76,138 and asp52) and, phylogenetic analyses showed a close relationship with orthologues from other gram-positive bacteria. molecular dynamics for structural determinations and molecular modeling using e. faecalis sufu primary sequence protein over the pdb:1su0 crystallographic model from streptococcus pyogenes were carried out with a subsequent 50 ns molecular dynamic trajectory. this presented a stable model, showing secondary structure modifications near the active site and conserved cysteine residues. molecular modeling using haemophilus influenzae iscu primary sequence over the pdb:1su0 crystal followed by a md trajectory was performed to analyse differences in the c-terminus region of gram-positive sufu and gram-negative orthologous proteins, in which several modifications in secondary structure were observed. conclusion:  the data describe the identification of the suf machinery for [fe-s] cluster biosynthesis present in the firmicutes genome, showing conserved sufb, sufc, sufd and sufs genes and the presence of the sufu gene coding for scaffold protein, instead of sufa; neither sufe nor sufr are present. primary sequences and structural analysis of the sufu protein demonstrated its structural-like pattern  to the scaffold protein iscu nearby on the isc machinery. e. faecalis sufu molecular modeling showed high flexibility over the active site regions, and demonstrated the existence of a specific region in firmicutes denoting the gram positive region (gpr), suggested as a possible candidate for interaction with other factors and/or regulators.

TI  == conjugative transfer of the integrative conjugative elements icest1 and icest3 from streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == integrative and conjugative elements (ices), also called conjugative transposons, are genomic islands that excise, self-transfer by conjugation, and integrate in the genome of the recipient bacterium. the current investigation shows the intraspecies conjugative transfer of the first described ices in streptococcus thermophilus, icest1 and icest3. mitomycin c, a dna-damaging agent, derepresses icest3 conjugative transfer almost 25-fold. the icest3 host range was determined  using various members of the firmicutes as recipients. whereas numerous icest3 transconjugants of streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis were recovered, only one transconjugant of lactococcus lactis was obtained. the newly  incoming ices, except the one from l. lactis, are site-specifically integrated into the 3' end of the fda gene and are still able to excise in these transconjugants. furthermore, icest3 was retransferred from e. faecalis to s. thermophilus. recombinant plasmids carrying different parts of the icest1 recombination module were used to show that the integrase gene is required for the site-specific integration and excision of the ices, whereas the excisionase gene is required for the site-specific excision only.

AB  == the objective was to determine the proportions and bacterial counts of major mastitis pathogens in samples of bulk tank milk (btm), as well as to clarify the  relationship between these bacteria counts and bulk tank somatic cell count (btscc). the purpose was to judge the importance of the counts of mammary pathogens for btscc at the population level. samples of btm were collected from 268 randomly selected anonymous dairy herds (with approximately 29 000 dairy cows). staphylococcus aureus, other coagulase-positive staphylococci, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus dysgalactiae were grouped as contagious pathogens, and streptococcus uberis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium as environmental pathogens. based on assessment of the dominant pathogen in each herd, environmental pathogens were found to dominate. counts of specific mammary pathogens in btm samples did not exceed a geometric mean of 1000 cfu/ml. significant differences were documented in btscc between btm samples containing str. agalactiae, staph. aureus, and str. dysgalactiae and btm samples that were pathogen-free. geometric means of btscc associated with these pathogens were noticeably higher than the overall btscc (str. agalactiae 243 628; staph. aureus  205 610; str. dysgalactiae 203 978; overall 173 000 cells/ml). it follows that the somatic cell count (scc) associated with these pathogens contributed substantially to the overall btscc. environmental pathogens predominated in samples of btm with scc <300x103/ml and contagious mastitis pathogens predominated in btm samples with scc >300x103/ml. no correlation was detected between bacterial counts of specific pathogens and btscc. this study revealed that the assessment of bacterial counts of mammary pathogens in samples of btm in relation to btscc is applicable for the monitoring of changes in the occurrence of major mastitis pathogens in dairy herds at a national level.

TI  == [comparative in vitro activity of daptomycin against gram-positive microorganisms: sentry surveillance program, spain (2002-2006)].
AB  == introduction and objective: daptomycin is a bactericidal lipopeptide antibiotic,  active against gram-positive bacteria. in this study, the comparative in vitro activity of daptomycin and other antimicrobial agents against isolates recovered  in 3 spanish hospitals from 2002 to 2006 was determined as part of the international sentry antimicrobial resistance surveillance program. the possible  therapeutic role of daptomycin is addressed in the light of spanish susceptibility data. methods: antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed  by the microdilution method with 1398 consecutively recovered gram-positive isolates. results: all the staphylococci (n = 1024), enterococci (n = 228), and streptococci (n = 146) studied were susceptible to daptomycin. the highest mic values were 1, 4, and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, regardless of methicillin, vancomycin, or penicillin resistance status. all staphylococcus aureus isolates were also susceptible to vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin. coagulase-negative staphylococci were susceptible to vancomycin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin. only daptomycin and linezolid were active against all enterococcal isolates. in addition, vancomycin, teicoplanin, and ampicillin were fully active against enterococcus faecalis. daptomycin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin were active against all streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, and s. viridans group isolates. the distribution of daptomycin mic values in s. aureus and enterococci was homogeneously sustained along the 5-year study period. conclusion: the sustained antimicrobial activity of daptomycin against staphylococci, enterococci, and streptococci in spain makes this antibiotic an excellent therapeutic option in severe infection caused by gram-positive microorganisms, including those with multiresistance.

TI  == what's new and not so new on the antimicrobial horizon?
AB  == despite increasing antimicrobial resistance and multiple drug resistance in clinical isolates of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, there are few novel antimicrobial agents in development. the few new agents that have been recently licensed have tended to have narrow spectra of activity, focused on gram-positive pathogens, especially methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). this situation is rightly causing concern among clinicians and public health authorities worldwide. this article reviews available data on three new antibacterials currently in development. the cephalosporin ceftobiprole is active against mrsa, enterococcus faecalis and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, but otherwise has a spectrum of activity similar to that of other recent cephalosporins. in a clinical trial, ceftobiprole was non-inferior to vancomycin for the treatment of mrsa-associated complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssis). doripenem, a new carbapenem, has some activity against mrsa, but otherwise has an anti-gram-positive spectrum of activity similar to that of imipenem and an anti-gram-negative spectrum similar to that of meropenem. in a clinical trial, it was non-inferior to meropenem for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections. iclaprim is a dihydrofolate  reductase inhibitor with greatly enhanced activity, as compared with trimethoprim, against a range of gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. the limited literature concerning this agent has concentrated on its potential role in the treatment of infections with gram-positive bacteria. a clinical trial has  demonstrated the non-inferiority of iclaprim, as compared with linezolid, in the  treatment of csssis, including those associated with mrsa.

TI  == change of intestinal microbiota with elemental diet and its impact on therapeutic effects in a murine model of chronic colitis.
AB  == elemental diet (ed) has been used as an enteral nutritional therapy for crohn's disease. however, the precise mechanisms of ed remain unclear. in interleukin-10  (il-10)-deficient cell-transferred mice, we investigated the change of intestinal microbiota with ed using molecular terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) analysis and culture method, and evaluated its influence on therapeutic effects of ed. ed significantly suppressed intestinal inflammation. the total amount of bacteria in colitis mice fed the regular diet was higher than in normal mice but decreased in colitis mice fed ed. t-rflp profiles of the ed group markedly differed from those of the regular diet groups. the diversity of bacterial species in the ed group decreased to 60% of that found in the regular diet groups. among the cultivated bacteria, the change in lactic acid bacteria composition was remarkable. lactobacillus reuteri and l. johnsonii decreased and  enterococcus faecalis and e. durans increased in the ed group. the culture supernatant of l. reuteri isolates induced significant tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) and il-6 activity in raw 264 cells, while the culture supernatant of e. faecalis and e. durans barely induced their activity. these data suggested that reduction in amount and diversity of intestinal microbiota and decrease of proinflammatory cytokines via a change in composition of lactic acid bacteria by ed seem to contribute to reduction of bowel inflammation in this model.

TI  == screening of surface properties and antagonistic substances production by lactic  acid bacteria isolated from the mammary gland of healthy and mastitic cows.
AB  == bovine mastitis (bm) is a costly disease in dairy cattle production. the prevention and treatment of mastitis is performed by applying antimicrobial products that negatively affect milk quality. in the last years, the use of probiotic microorganisms to prevent infections in humans and animals has being aggressively studied. samples from teat canal and milk (foremilk and stripping) were taken from healthy and mastitic mammary quarters. a screening of the surface properties and antagonistic substances production of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from the mammary gland was performed to select potential probiotic strains to prevent mastitis. somatic cell count, physico-chemical and microbiological studies were carried out. pre-selected microorganisms were genetically identified. compared with stripping milk, foremilk showed lower levels of fat and higher levels of ph, density, microorganism numbers, lower percentage of strains with mean and high hydrophobicity and mean autoaggregation  and higher number of strains able to produce hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocins.  the other parameters analyzed were not statistically significant. one hundred and two lab strains were isolated. most of them had low degrees of hydrophobicity and autoaggregation. no correlation between these properties was found. antagonistic  metabolites were mainly produced by strains isolated from healthy quarters. most  of the pre-selected strains were identified as streptococcus bovis and weissella  paramesenteroides. three bacteriocin-producers were found and their products partially characterized. the results of this work are the basis for the further design of a specie-specific probiotic product able to prevent bm.

TI  == lagging-strand dna replication origins are required for conjugal transfer of the  promiscuous plasmid pmv158.
AB  == the promiscuous streptococcal plasmid pmv158 is mobilizable by auxiliary plasmids and replicates by the rolling-circle mechanism in a variety of bacterial hosts. the plasmid has two lagging-strand origins, ssoa and ssou, involved in the conversion of single-stranded dna intermediates into double-stranded plasmid dna  during vegetative replication. transfer of the plasmid also would involve conversion of single-stranded dna molecules into double-stranded plasmid forms in the recipient cells by conjugative replication. to test whether lagging-strand origins played a role in horizontal transfer, pmv158 derivatives defective in one or in both sso's were constructed and tested for their ability to colonize new hosts by means of intra- and interspecies mobilization. whereas either sso supported transfer between strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, only plasmids that had an intact ssou could be efficiently mobilized from s. pneumoniae to enterococcus faecalis. thus, it appears that ssou is a critical factor for pmv158 promiscuity and that the presence of a functional sso plays an essential role in  plasmid transfer.

TI  == streptococci and lactococci synthesize large amounts of hpr(ser-p)(his~p).
AB  == hpr is a protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase transport system (pts). in gram-positive bacteria, hpr can be phosphorylated on ser-46 by the kinase/phosphorylase hprk/p and on his-15 by phospho-enzyme i (ei~p) of the pts. in vitro studies with purified hprs from bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus salivarius have indicated that the phosphorylation of one residue impedes the phosphorylation of the other. however, a recent study showed that while the rate of streptococcus salivarius hpr phosphorylation by ei~p is reduced at acidic ph, the phosphorylation of hpr(ser-p) by ei~p, generating hpr(ser-p)(his~p), is stimulated. this suggests that hpr(ser-p)(his~p) synthesis may occur in acidogenic bacteria unable to maintain their intracellular ph near neutrality. consistent with this hypothesis, significant amounts of hpr(ser-p)(his~p) have been detected in some streptococci. the present study was  aimed at determining whether the capacity to synthesize hpr(ser-p)(his~p) is common to streptococcal species, as well as to lactococci, which are also unable  to maintain their intracellular ph near neutrality in response to a decrease in extracellular ph. our results indicated that unlike staphylococcus aureus, b. subtilis, and e. faecalis, all the streptococcal and lactococcal species tested were able to synthesize large amounts of hpr(ser-p)(his~p) during growth. we also showed that streptococcus salivarius iiablman, a protein involved in sugar transport by the pts, could be efficiently phosphorylated by hpr(ser-p)(his~p).

TI  == bacteriology of non-surgical wound infections in ibadan, nigeria.
AB  == previous studies done on wound infections in this environment had been mostly on  the surgical variety rather than the non-surgical. however,few studies available  on the non-surgical type have indicated that changes do occur in the pattern and  antibiogram of the bacterial isolates of these non-surgical wound infections. this study was therefore designed to investigate the bacteriology of non-surgical wound infections in this environment. a retrospective review of seven hundred and fifty four cases of non-surgical wound infections was conducted between september 2002 and february 2005 at the university college hospital, ibadan, nigeria. a total number of 871 bacterial, and seven fungal isolates were obtained from these wound cultures. in 477 (70.3%) cases, cultures were monomicrobial and 202 (29.8%) polymicrobial. staphylococcus aureus (38%) was the predominant pathogen, followed by pseudomonas aeruginosa (18.7%), klebsiella species (17%), escherichia coli (10.6%), proteus species (7.4%), staphylococcus epidermidis (4.4%), streptococcus species (1.6%), enterococcus faecalis (1.4%), and candida albicans (0.8%). high rates of antibiotic resistance were recorded among these isolates. 53.4% of them  were sensitive to ceftriaxone, 42.5% to gentamycin and 39.3% to ofloxacin. this high antibiotic resistance gives credence to the value of determining the antibiogram of these pathogens in their management. continuous interaction between the wound care practitioners and microbiology department is also advocated.

TI  == a promising microbiological test for the diagnosis of drowning.
AB  == a number of biological and chemical tests have been developed over the years to determine whether a person was drowned. this study focuses on the potential of a  microbiological test for detecting common bacterial markers of water faecal pollution such as faecal coliforms (fc) and faecal streptococci (fs) as possible  indicators of drowning. a promising previous study was carried out on central and peripheral blood samples of 42 drowned victims (20 cases in saltwater and 22 cases in freshwater) and 30 not-drowned bodies. to improve the accuracy of our previous results and also in order to investigate a possible cause of a false positive due to pulmonary passive diffusion and subsequently endogenous or exogenous bacterial invasion of the blood in the post-mortem interval (pmi), the  fc and fs test was applied to bodies submerged in water but died from causes other than drowning. in the present study, blood samples collected from the left  ventricle (lv), right ventricle (rv), femoral artery (fa) and, femoral vein (fv)  of 10 drowned victims (5 cases in freshwater and 5 cases in seawater) and 3 not-drowned individuals with bodies submerged in water for a while after death have been analysed. preliminary results are in agreement with other reports dealing with diatoms and marine bacteria that suggest to exclude the hypothesis of a passive penetration of sufficient quantities of drowning medium into circulation after death or during the agonal period. based on our results there is also no evidence of a relevant dissemination of endogenous micro-flora from the gastrointestinal tract affecting the fs and fc test. there are still several  other factors that could influence the applicability of post-mortem fs and fc cultures for the diagnosis of drowning and they need further investigations. the  present article provides only a glimpse of the potential of the fs and fc test as bacteriological method for the diagnosis of drowning.

TI  == characterization of guanylate kinase from gram positive and gram negative microorganisms; preliminary results.
AB  == guanylate kinase is a member of the nucleoside monophosphate (nmp) kinase family, a family of enzymes that despite having a low primary structure identity share a  similar fold, which consists of three structurally distinct regions termed the core, lid, and nmp-binding regions. guanylate kinase (gmpk) is an essential enzyme for the biosynthesis of gtp and dgtp by catalyzing the phosphoryl transfer from atp to (d)gmp resulting in adp and (d)gdp. despite the similar fold of the monomer there is an important difference between gmpks from prokaryotes and eukaryotes: eukaryotes gmpk are monomers while prokaryotes gmpk are dimmers, tetramers or hexamers. for this reason bacterial gmpks are possible targets for new antibacterial drugs. finding new targets for antibacterial therapies is a prior subject in today's medical research. the purpose of this work was to characterize guanylate kinases from both gram positive and gram negative pathogenic bacteria. we started with gmpk from enterococcus faecalis as gram positive microorganism and pseudomonas aeruginosa as gram negative representative.

AB  == in contrast to breast milk, little is known about the bacterial composition of human colostrum. the objective of this work was to analyze the bacterial diversity of colostrum obtained from healthy women and to characterize the dominant bacterial species for the presence of possible virulence factors. samples of colostrum obtained from 36 healthy women were inoculated into different culture media. several isolates from each medium were selected and identified. staphylococcal and enterococcal isolates were submitted to genetic profiling. one representative of each profile was included in a genetic and phenotypic characterization scheme, including detection of potential virulence traits/genes and sensitivity to antibiotics. staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis were the dominant species, followed by streptococcus mitis, propionibacterium acnes and staphylococcus lugdunensis. among the 48 s. epidermidis isolates selected on the basis of their genetic profiles, the biofilm-related icad gene and the meca gene were detected in only 11 and six isolates, respectively. in parallel, 10 enterococcal isolates were also characterized and none of them contained the cyla, vana, vanb, vand, vane and vang genes. all of them were sensitive to vancomycin. there were no indications that the colostrum samples contained harmful bacteria.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine if varying the percent (by weight) of  aqueous calcium hydroxide or using different vehicles had an effect on its antibacterial efficacy against common endodontic pathogens in a pour plate/traditional streak agar diffusion model. mixtures of calcium hydroxide powder and sterile saline in 40, 50 and 60 percent concentrations and the commercial preparations ultracal xs and vitapex were tested against six known endodontic pathogens with an agar diffusion method. each medicament was placed in one of five wells, in each of 10 agar plates (n = 10), for cultures of each bacterial species. zones of inhibition were measured after 48 hours incubation for aerobes and 96 hours incubation for anaerobes. multiple one-way analyses of variance and post-hoc student neuman keuls evaluated the data at alpha = 0.05. larger zones of inhibition were consistently observed for higher concentrations of calcium hydroxide with statistical significance among the bacteria, particularly between 40% and 60%. vitapex had significantly smaller zones of inhibition than all other medicaments and 35% ultracal xs with methylcellulose was nearly as effective as 50% ca(oh)(2) in inhibitory activity. formulations containing 50-60% ca(oh)(2) or 35% ca(oh)(2) with aqueous methylcellulose are recommended as endodontic interappointment medicaments.

TI  == in vitro bactericidal activity of recombinant human beta-defensin-3 against pathogenic bacterial strains in human tooth root canal.
AB  == human beta-defensin-3 (hbd3), an endogenous antimicrobial peptide, has strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. this study aimed to obtain recombinant hbd3 (rhbd3) and to test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial characteristics of hbd3 may offer an advantage over conventional medicine in reducing intracanal bacteria. genetic engineering was used to obtain active rhbd3 and analysis revealed that it exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity at low micromolar concentrations against not only staphylococcus aureus and escherichia  coli but also against some critical pathogenic microbes in infected root canals,  including fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella melaninogenica, peptostreptococcus  anaerobius, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces naeslundii, enterococcus faecalis and candida albicans. in an in vitro antibacterial experiment, rhbd3 significantly eliminated pathogenic bacteria in root canals. the ratio of bacterial death was up to 98%. we conclude that hbd3 has the potential to eliminate bacteria effectively and rapidly in the local microenvironment of the root canal system and that it may contribute to successful endodontic treatment.

TI  == in vitro activity of daptomycin against gram-positive cocci: the first multicentre study in greece.
AB  == a total of 10420 gram-positive cocci (including staphylococci, enterococci and various groups of streptococci) collected from clinically significant specimens in ten greek hospitals during 2006--2007 were tested for their susceptibility to  daptomycin. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined by the broth microdilution method. daptomycin demonstrated very high activity against enterococcus faecalis (mic at which 50% of the isolates were inhibited (mic50) =  1mg/l and mic at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited (mic90) = 1.36 mg/l), enterococcus faecium (mic50 = 1.36 mg/l and mic90 = 1.90 mg/l), streptococcus pyogenes (mic50 = 0.12 mg/l and mic90 = 0.50mg/l), streptococcus agalactiae (mic50 = 0.09 mg/l and mic90 = 0.12 mg/l), streptococcus pneumoniae (mic50 = 0.24 mg/l and mic90 = 0.5 mg/l) and viridans group streptococci (mic50 = 0.50 mg/l and mic90 = 0.89 mg/l). resistance to linezolid and vancomycin for enterococci and to penicillin for streptococci appears to be independent of reduced susceptibility to daptomycin. on the other hand, daptomycin was also active against meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mic50 = 0.44 mg/l and mic90 = 0.78 mg/l) and meticillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (mic50 = 0.24 mg/l and mic90 = 0.44 mg/l); however, 0.9% of the staphylococci tested had an mic > 1mg/l, which is the clinical and laboratory standards institute breakpoint proposed for susceptibility. for all tested organism groups, resistance to daptomycin was not associated with glycopeptide resistance.

TI  == fluorescence in situ hybridisation (fish) accelerates identification of gram-positive cocci in positive blood cultures.
AB  == sepsis is a life-threatening disease with a high mortality rate. rapid identification of blood culture isolates plays a crucial role in adequate antimicrobial therapy in sepsis patients. to accelerate microbiological diagnosis, a comprehensive panel of oligonucleotide probes for fluorescence in situ hybridisation (fish) targeting gram-positive cocci was compiled and evaluated on 428 positive blood culture specimens. by combining genus-specific and species-specific probes, the assay allowed discrimination of staphylococci, streptococci and enterococci as well as differentiation of therapy-relevant pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium/durans. furthermore, the newly designed fish probes strep2, enco and granu targeted streptococcus pneumoniae/mitis, enterococcus spp. (except e. faecalis) and granulicatella adiacens group, respectively. the fish assay achieved an overall sensitivity of 98.65% and a specificity of 99.0% and therefore allowed rapid and  reliable molecular identification of gram-positive cocci in blood culture specimens.

TI  == differentiation of streptococcus pneumoniae conjunctivitis outbreak isolates by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus [pnc]) is a causative agent of many infectious diseases, including pneumonia, septicemia, otitis media, and conjunctivitis. there have been documented conjunctivitis outbreaks in which nontypeable (nt), nonencapsulated pnc has been identified as the etiological agent. the use of mass spectrometry to comparatively and differentially analyze protein and peptide profiles of whole-cell microorganisms remains somewhat uncharted. in this report, we discuss a comparative proteomic analysis between nt s. pneumoniae conjunctivitis outbreak strains (cpnc) and other known typeable or  nt pneumococcal and streptococcal isolates (including pnc tigr4 and r6, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes) and nonstreptococcal isolates (including escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus) as controls. cpnc cells and controls were grown to mid-log phase, harvested, and subsequently treated with a 10% trifluoroacetic acid-sinapinic acid matrix mixture. protein and peptide fragments of the whole-cell bacterial isolate-matrix combinations ranging in size from 2 to 14 kda were evaluated by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. additionally random forest analytical tools and dendrogramic representations (genesis) suggested similarities and clustered the isolates into distinct clonal groups, respectively. also, a peak list of protein and peptide masses was obtained and compared to a known pnc protein mass library, in which a peptide common and unique to cpnc isolates was tentatively identified. information gained from this  study will lead to the identification and validation of proteins that are commonly and exclusively expressed in cpnc strains which could potentially be used as a biomarker in the rapid diagnosis of pneumococcal conjunctivitis.

TI  == surfactants as microbicides and contraceptive agents: a systematic in vitro study.
AB  == background: the urgent need for cheap and easy-to-use protection against both unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases has stimulated considerable interest in the use of surfactants as microbicides, anti-viral, and  contraceptive agents in recent years. in the present study we report a systematic in vitro evaluation of the microbicidal, anti-viral and contraceptive potential of cationic, anionic, zwitterionic, and non-ionic surfactants. methodology/principal findings: toxicity was evaluated in mammalian columnar epithelial (mdck) cells, human sperm cells, candida albicans, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, neisseria gonorrhoeae, streptococcus agalactiae and enterococcus faecalis. the inhibition of adenovirus and lentivirus infection of mdck cells was also tested. a homologous series of cationic surfactants, alkyl-n,n,n-trimethylammonium bromides (c(n)tab), with varying alkyl chains were  shown to be bactericidal and fungicidal at doses that were related to the surfactant critical micelle concentrations (cmc), all of them at concentrations significantly below the cmc. in general, bacteria were more susceptible to this surfactant group than c. albicans and this organism, in turn, was more susceptible than mdck cells. this suggests that the c(n)tab may be useful as vaginal disinfectants only in so far as bacterial and fungal infections are concerned. none of the surfactants examined, including those that have been used  in pre-clinical studies, showed inhibition of adenovirus or lentivirus infection  of mdck cells or spermicidal activity at doses that were sub-toxic to mdck cells. conclusions/significance: the results of this study lead us to propose that systematic analysis of surfactant toxicity, such as we report in the present work, be made a mandatory pre-condition for the use of these substances in pre-clinical animal and/or human studies.

TI  == novel endo-alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidases with broader substrate specificity.
AB  == in an effort to identify novel endo-alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidases (endo-alpha-galnacases), four potential genes were cloned. three of the expressed proteins engef from enterococcus faecalis, engpa from propionibacterium acnes, and engcp from clostridium perfringens were purified and characterized. their substrate specificity was investigated and compared to the commercially available endo-alpha-galnacases from streptococcus pneumoniae (engsp) and alcaligenes sp. (engal). all enzymes were incubated with various synthetic substrates, and natural glycoproteins and the released sugars were detected by colorimetric assay and thin layer chromatography analysis. the core 1 disaccharide gal beta 1,3galnac alpha 1pnp was the most rapidly hydrolyzed substrate by all enzymes tested. engef exhibited the highest k(cat) for this substrate. engef and engpa were also able to fully hydrolyze the core 3 disaccharide glcnac beta 1,3galnac alpha 1pnp. this is the first report of endo-alpha-galnacases engef and engpa acting on core 3 in addition to core 1 o-glycans. interestingly, there were no significant differences in transglycosylation activities when gal beta 1,3galnac  alpha 1pnp or glcnac beta 1,3galnac alpha 1pnp was incubated with various 1-alkanols in the presence of the endo-alpha-galnacases tested in this work.

AB  == streptococcus uberis ucn60 was resistant to spiramycin (mic = 8 microg/ml) but susceptible to erythromycin (mic = 0.06 microg/ml), azithromycin (mic = 0.12 microg/ml), josamycin (mic = 0.25 microg/ml), and tylosin (mic = 0.5 microg/ml).  a 2.5-kb hindiii fragment was cloned from s. uberis ucn60 dna on plasmid puc18 and introduced into escherichia coli ag100a, where it conferred resistance to spiramycin by inactivation. the sequence analysis of the fragment showed the presence of an rdmc-like gene that putatively encoded a protein belonging to the  alpha/beta hydrolase family and of the first 196 nucleotides of the mph(b) gene putatively encoding a phosphotransferase known to inactivate 14-, 15-, and 16-membered macrolides in e. coli. the entire mph(b) gene was then identified in  s. uberis ucn60. the two genes were expressed alone or in combination in e. coli, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. analysis of mics revealed that  rdmc-like alone did not confer resistance to erythromycin, tylosin, and josamycin in those three hosts. it conferred resistance to spiramycin in e. coli and e. faecalis but not in s. aureus. mph(b) conferred resistance in e. coli to erythromycin, tylosin, josamycin, and spiramycin but only low levels of resistance in e. faecalis and s. aureus to spiramycin (mic = 8 microg/ml). the combination of mph(b) and rdmc-like genes resulted in a resistance to spiramycin  and tylosin in the three hosts that significantly exceeded the mere addition of the resistance levels conferred by each resistance mechanism alone.

TI  == ceftobiprole: an extended-spectrum anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus cephalosporin.
AB  == objective: to summarize and evaluate the literature concerning ceftobiprole. data sources: literature identification was conducted through medline (1966-february 2008) and international pharmaceutical abstracts (1970-february 2008) using the terms ceftobiprole, medocaril, bal 5788, ro-5788, bal 9141, ro 63-9141, pyrrolidinone cephalosporin, mrsa, complicated skin and skin-structure infections (csssis), community-acquired pneumonia, and nosocomial pneumonia. additional publications were identified through a review of articles and abstracts from infectious disease meetings. study selection and data extraction: all articles in english were evaluated and all pertinent information was included. data synthesis: ceftobiprole medocaril is an extended-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus spp., vancomycin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, enterobacteriaceae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. inactivity includes extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae and enterococcus faecium. preliminary data suggest that ceftobiprole may be effective with a 1-hour infusion of 500 mg every 12 hours for gram-positive infections and 500 mg every 8 hours with a 2-hour infusion for polymicrobial infections. two clinical trials support these dosing regimens for csssis. ceftobiprole was noninferior to vancomycin in suspected gram-positive csssis, with cure rates of 93.3% and 93.5%, respectively. furthermore, ceftobiprole was noninferior to vancomycin and ceftazidime in polymicrobial csssis (cure rates 90.5% vs 90.2%, respectively). although the total number of adverse effects was similar to those of the comparator, more patients in the ceftobiprole group experienced nausea, vomiting, and dysgeusia. conclusions: the  activity of ceftobiprole and limited clinical data suggest that it may be useful  as empiric monotherapy for csssi and in combination with other antimicrobials in  lower respiratory tract infections for which phase 3 clinical trials are currently exploring. although not shown in vitro, ceftobiprole may induce resistance due to its broad spectrum of activity. approval is expected for the treatment of csssi.

TI  == lipoprotein signal peptides are processed by lsp and eep of streptococcus uberis.
AB  == lipoprotein signal peptidase (lsp) is responsible for cleaving the signal peptide sequence of lipoproteins in gram-positive bacteria. investigation of the role of  lsp in streptococcus uberis, a common cause of bovine mastitis, was undertaken using the lipoprotein mtua (a protein essential for virulence) as a marker. the s. uberis lsp mutant phenotype displayed novel lipoprotein processing. not only was full-length (uncleaved) mtua detected by western blotting, but during late log phase, a lower-molecular-weight derivative of mtua was evident. similar analysis of an s. uberis double mutant containing insertions disrupting both lsp  and eep (a homologue of the enterococcus faecalis "enhanced expression of pheromone" gene) indicated a role for eep in cleavage of lipoproteins in the absence of lsp. such a function may indicate a role for eep in maintenance of secretion pathways during disruption of normal lipoprotein processing.

TI  == antimicrobial effect and ph of chlorhexidine gel and calcium hydroxide alone and  associated with other materials.
AB  == the purposes of this study were to evaluate the effectiveness of 2% chlorhexidine (chx) gluconate gel, calcium hydroxide [ca(oh)2] and their combination with iodoform and zinc oxide powder as intracanal medications against select microorganisms, and to measure the ph changes caused by these medications. antimicrobial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method. the zones of  growth inhibition were measured and the results were analyzed statistically by kruskal-wallis test (p<0.05). the ph of the pastes was measured right after preparation, after 24 h and 1 week later. the largest mean zones of microbial inhibition were produced by 2% chx gel, followed by ca(oh)2 + 2% chx gel + iodoform, ca(oh)2 + 2% chx gel, ca(oh)2 + 2% chx gel + zinc oxide, and ca(oh)2 +  water. the mean ph of all medications stayed above 12.0 during the whole experiment, except for chx gel (ph=7.0). the results of this study showed that all medications had antimicrobial activity, but the most effective against the tested microorganisms were 2% chx gel, followed by its combination with ca(oh)2 and iodoform.

TI  == frequency and expression of mutacin biosynthesis genes in isolates of streptococcus mutans with different mutacin-producing phenotypes.
AB  == the aim of this study was to analyse the frequency and expression of biosynthesis genes in 47 streptococcus mutans isolates with different mutacin-producing phenotypes. detection of the frequency and expression of genes encoding mutacin types i, ii, iii and iv were carried out by pcr and semi-quantitative rt-pcr, respectively, using primers specific for each type of biosynthesis gene. in addition, a further eight genes encoding putative bacteriocins, designated bsm 283, bsm 299, bsm 423, bsm 1889c, bsm 1892c, bsm 1896, bsm 1906c and bsm 1914, were also screened. there was a high phenotypic diversity; some streptococcus mutans isolates presented broad antimicrobial spectra against other streptococcus mutans clinical isolates, including bacteria resistant to common antibiotics, as  well as staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis  and streptococcus pyogenes. the expression frequency of the bsm gene was higher than that of the previously characterized mutacins (i-iv). there was no positive  correlation between the number of indicator strains inhibited (antimicrobial spectra) and the number of biosynthesis genes expressed (spearman correlation test, r=-0.03, p>0.05). in conclusion, the high diversity of mutacin-producing phenotypes, associated with high frequency of expression of the biosynthesis genes screened, reveals a broad repertoire of genetic determinants encoding antimicrobial peptides that can act in different combinations.

TI  == impact of growth conditions on susceptibility of five microbial species to alkaline stress.
AB  == the effects of different growth conditions on the susceptibility of five taxa to  alkaline stress were investigated. enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, streptococcus sobrinus omz 176, candida albicans atcc 90028, actinomyces naeslundii atcc 12104, and fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 10953 were grown as planktonic cells, allowed to adhere to dentin for 24 hours, grown as monospecies  or multispecies biofilms on dentin under anaerobic conditions with a serum-enriched nutrient supply at 37 degrees c for 5 days. in addition, suspended biofilm microorganisms and 5-day old planktonic multispecies cultures were used.  microbial recovery upon direct exposure to saturated calcium hydroxide solution (ph 12.5) for 10 and 100 minutes was compared with control exposure to physiologic saline. planktonic microorganisms were most susceptible; only e. faecalis and c. albicans survived in saturated solution for 10 minutes, the latter also for 100 minutes. dentin adhesion was the major factor in improving the resistance of e. faecalis and a. naeslundii to calcium hydroxide, whereas the multispecies context in a biofilm was the major factor in promoting resistance of s. sobrinus to the disinfectant. in contrast, the c. albicans response to calcium hydroxide was not influenced by the growth condition. adherence to dentin and interspecies interactions in a biofilm appear to differentially affect the sensitivity of microbial species to calcium hydroxide.

TI  == antibiotic resistance gene transfer between streptococcus gordonii and enterococcus faecalis in root canals of teeth ex vivo.
AB  == multiple bacterial species coexisting in infected root canals might interact, but evidence for interspecies gene transfer is lacking. this study tested the hypothesis that horizontal exchange of antibiotic resistance can occur between different bacterial species in root canals. transfer of the conjugative plasmid pam81 carrying erythromycin resistance between 2 endodontic infection-associated  species, streptococcus gordonii and enterococcus faecalis, was investigated in an ex vivo tooth model. equal numbers of each species (one with pam81 and the other  plasmid-free) were combined in prepared root canals of sterilized teeth and incubated at 37 degrees c. at 24 and 72 hours, bidirectional interspecies antibiotic resistance gene transfer was evident in microorganisms recovered from  teeth; average transfer frequencies from s. gordonii to e. faecalis were 10(-3) transconjugants per donor and from e. faecalis to s. gordonii were 10(-6) and 10(-7) transconjugants per donor at 24 and 72 hours, respectively. microbial accumulations were observed on root canal walls with scanning electron microscopy. horizontal genetic exchange in endodontic infections might facilitate adoption of an optimal genetic profile for survival.

TI  == diversity of stress responses in dairy thermophilic streptococci.
AB  == exponential and stationary phase cells of 56 strains of the dairy streptococcus species s. thermophilus, s. macedonicus and s. salivarius, were exposed to acid,  osmotic, oxidative and heat stresses to investigate the diversity of their responses. three strains of dairy related streptococci, lactococcus lactis atcc11454, enterococcus faecium dsm20477 and enterococcus faecalis dsm20478, were included for comparison purposes. acid and heat adaptation and cross-protection to stress were studied in ten strains with different stress response patterns. cell death and the changes in protein expression were evaluated by plate counts and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrilamide gel electrophoresis, respectively. all  strains of all species were highly tolerant of osmotic stress. with a few exceptions, acid and oxidative treatments reduced the number of viable cells by >5 log units but responses to heat stress were more variable. for some, but not all strains, stationary phase cells were more resistant to some or all stresses.  matrix cluster analysis was used to group strains on the basis of their pattern of stress response in seven clusters. significant associations between the sources of strains and stress resistance were found for acid and oxidative stresses. adaptation to stress during the exponential phase enhanced the survival of acid and heat stressed cells from 1 to 60,000-folds, but a detrimental effect  of adaptation on cell viability was evident for oxidative and osmotic stresses for three strains. adaptation and entry into the stationary phase resulted in significant changes of protein bands whose estimated molecular masses corresponded with those of proteins (dnak, gpre, groel, and groes) involved in the general stress response but no statistically significant correlation between  stress response and band intensity was evident.

TI  == bacterial infections in pigs experimentally infected with nipah virus.
AB  == nipah virus (niv; paramyxoviridae) caused fatal encephalitis in humans during an  outbreak in malaysia in 1998/1999 after transmission from infected pigs. our previous study demonstrated that the respiratory, lymphatic and central nervous systems are targets for virus replication in experimentally infected pigs. to continue the studies on pathogenesis of niv in swine, six piglets were inoculated oronasally with 2.5 x 10(5) pfu per animal. four pigs developed mild clinical signs, one exudative epidermitis, and one neurologic signs due to suppurative meningoencephalitis, and was euthanized at 11 days post-inoculation (dpi). neutralizing antibodies reached in surviving animals titers around 1280 at 16 dpi. nasal and oro-pharyngeal shedding of the niv was detected between 2 and 17 dpi. virus appeared to be cleared from the tissues of the infected animals by 23  dpi, with low amount of rna detected in submandibular and bronchial lymph nodes of three pigs, and olfactory bulb of one animal. despite the presence of neutralizing antibodies, virus was isolated from serum at 24 dpi, and the viral rna was still detected in serum at 29 dpi. our results indicate slower clearance  of niv from some of the infected pigs. bacteria were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of five niv inoculated animals, with isolation of streptococcus suis and enterococcus faecalis. staphylococcus hyicus was isolated  from the skin lesions of the animal with exudative epidermitis. along with the observed lymphoid depletion in the lymph nodes of all niv-infected animals, and the demonstrated ability of niv to infect porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro, this finding warrants further investigation into a possible niv-induced immunosuppression of the swine host.

TI  == relationship of vaginal microflora to prom, pprom and the risk of early-onset neonatal sepsis.
AB  == background: infections are among the most frequent causes of premature delivery and premature discharges of amniotic fluid. the vaginal ecosystem significantly contributes to the development of these conditions. premature rupture of membranes (prom) and preterm premature rupture of membranes (pprom) are associated with an increased risk of intra-amniotic infection. the intra-amniotic infection negatively affects perinatal morbidity and mortality of newborns. objectives: finding of relationship of vaginal microflora to prom, pprom and the  risk of early-onset neonatal sepsis. methods: a prospective study was implemented in 152 women with singleton gestations with prom (n=52) and pprom (n=47); the control group included 53 women with physiologic pregnancy and delivery at normal term without prom. in all the women, aerobic cultivations from the vagina and cervix for chlamydia trachomatis were provided before initiation of antibiotic treatment, the microbial picture of vagina was examined, and the cultivation examination of urine was carried out. the placenta was subjected to histopathologic examination. for the diagnosis of early-onset sepsis, we used concentrations of cytokines il-6, il-8, tnf-alpha, and the adhesion molecule, icam-1, from the venous umbilical blood taken immediately after delivery and cutting of the umbilical cord. demonstrated early neonatal sepsis served as a further criterion. results: the most frequent bacteriologic findings throughout the group were coagulase-negative staphylococci, ureaplasma, candida albicans, and streptococcus viridans. women with a diagnosis of urinary tract infection or  diabetes mellitus were excluded from the study. we found no statistically significant relationship between a specific bacterial strain and prom and pprom.  we found a statistically significant association between the risk for intra-amniotic infection and the finding of s. viridans (p<0.001). there was also a statistically significant relationship between the microbiologic picture of the vagina vi and infection risk (p<0.002). conclusions: based on results of the present study, it is clear that the use of cultivation and microscopic findings in the vagina and cervix for the timely diagnosis of the risk of early-onset neonatal sepsis is restricted.

TI  == bacterial profiles of root caries in elderly patients.
AB  == culture-based studies have shown that streptococcus mutans and lactobacilli are associated with root caries (rc). the purpose of the present study was to assess  the bacterial diversity of rc in elderly patients by use of culture-independent molecular techniques and to determine the associations of specific bacterial species or bacterial communities with healthy and carious roots. plaque was collected from root surfaces of 10 control subjects with no rc and from 11 subjects with rc. the bacterial 16s rrna genes from extracted dna were pcr amplified, cloned, and sequenced to determine species identity. from a total of 3,544 clones, 245 predominant species or phylotypes were observed, representing eight bacterial phyla. the majority (54%) of the species detected have not yet been cultivated. species of selenomonas and veillonella were common in all samples. the healthy microbiota included fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, leptotrichia spp., selenomonas noxia, streptococcus cristatus, and kingella oralis. lactobacilli were absent, s. mutans was present in one, and actinomyces spp. were present in 50% of the controls. in contrast, the microbiota of the rc subjects was dominated by actinomyces spp., lactobacilli, s. mutans, enterococcus faecalis, selenomonas sp. clone cs002, atopobium and olsenella spp., prevotella multisaccharivorax, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, and propionibacterium sp. strain fma5. the bacterial profiles of rc showed considerable subject-to-subject variation, indicating that the microbial communities are more complex than previously presumed. the data suggest that putative etiological agents of rc include not only s. mutans, lactobacilli, and actinomyces but also species of atopobium, olsenella, pseudoramibacter, propionibacterium, and selenomonas.

AB  == ceftobiprole is a 1st-in-class anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) extended-spectrum cephalosporin currently in clinical trials for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssis) and nosocomial pneumonia. this agent is also active against other prominent gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, making it an attractive candidate for  broad-spectrum therapy. we evaluated the in vitro potency of ceftobiprole tested  against the most commonly occurring bacterial pathogens as part of a global surveillance study for the years 2005 to 2006 (>60 medical centers in north america, latin america, and europe). all isolates (40 675) were susceptibility tested using reference broth microdilution methods. ceftobiprole inhibited 100% and >99% of tested s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci at < or =4 and  < or =8 microg/ml, respectively, although mic90 values for oxacillin-resistant strains were 4-fold and 8-fold higher than oxacillin-susceptible isolates for the 2 groups. ceftobiprole was also broadly active against streptococcus pneumoniae,  beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci, inhibiting >98% of isolates at <  or =0.5 microg/ml. although ceftobiprole was generally inactive against enterococcus faecium, the majority of enterococcus faecalis strains (95.7%) were  inhibited at < or =4 microg/ml. this agent was similar in potency to the "3rd- and 4th-generation" cephems (mic50 values, < or =0.06 microg/ml) for all tested enterobacteriaceae. although cefepime provided enhanced coverage against klebsiella spp. (86.5% at < or =8 microg/ml versus 76.9-81.7% for ceftobiprole and ceftazidime), ceftobiprole and cefepime were superior to ceftazidime against  enterobacter spp. and citrobacter spp. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, ceftobiprole was equal in potency to ceftazidime (mic50, 2 microg/ml) and 2-fold  more potent than cefepime. none of these agents inhibited >45% of acinetobacter spp. at 8 mug/ml. ceftobiprole is a new anti-mrsa beta-lactam with recognized activity against the most commonly occurring enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa, similar to that of extended-spectrum cephems. these characteristics warrant continued evaluation of the agent as empiric therapy for csssis, and in pneumonia, especially in those institutions/regions where mrsa and p. aeruginosa  may be prevalent.

TI  == pediatric endocarditis and stroke: a single-center retrospective review of seven  cases.
AB  == the acute management of strokes in children with infective endocarditis is limited by the paucity of published data on their clinical course and outcomes. our retrospective study at an urban tertiary-care academic center characterized the clinical course of seven pediatric patients with endocarditis and subsequent  cerebral infarcts. among 115 patients with endocarditis, a stroke occurred in seven. four patients manifested congenital heart disease. in six patients, the stroke occurred in the distribution of the middle cerebral artery, with no preference for the left or right hemisphere. the most common presenting sign was  focal weakness. three patients manifested mycotic aneurysms, all of which were successfully repaired. two patients received aspirin therapy, with no adverse effects. all patients survived, but neurologic recovery was variable. the two youngest patients (aged 3 and 14 weeks) demonstrated the longest periods of hospitalization, with the most severe neurologic impairment. these findings suggest that children may have better outcomes than adults after a stroke secondary to bacterial endocarditis. routine surveillance for mycotic aneurysms in patients with new neurologic deficits, and the use of aspirin, should be considered in the medical management.

TI  == [antibiotics susceptibility of streptococcus and enterococcus: data of onerba network].
AB  == this work was aimed to analyze trends in susceptibility to antibiotics among the  main species of beta-hemolytic streptococci involved in community-acquired infections in human (streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae), or in  animals (streptococcus suis and streptococcus uberis) and also among the main enterocci species, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium. data were recorded since 1996 through the onerba networks. s. pyogenes, as the other beta-hemolytic streptococci studied remained fully susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics. however, susceptibility to macrolides is clearly decreasing in s. pyogenes. in 2002, only 62 to 65% of the strains according to the network considered, were susceptible to erythromycin. a similar trend was observed for s. agalactiae with only 75% of erythromycin susceptibility in 2002, and for both species isolated from animals s. suis and s. uberis, with respectively 35 and 76% of strains susceptible to erythromycin. in enterococci, susceptibility to beta-lactams remained stable between 2000 and 2004. indeed, the susceptibility to aminopenicillins remained high in e. faecalis (about 98%), whereas the proportion of e. faecium isolates susceptible to these antibiotics were lower than 60%. from 1999 to 2004, various studies conducted in french hospitals showed that the vancomycin resistance among enterococci accounted for less than 2%. however, the  recent emergence of glycopeptide resistant enterococci clusters in french hospitals is a matter of concern and emphasizes the need for an ongoing surveillance. such trend in macrolide resistance among s. pyogenes or s. agalactiae should consequently lead to propose other alternatives in case of beta-lactam allergy, and for pharyngitis, to rethink the place of the culture for susceptibility testing.

TI  == placental histological inflammation and reproductive tract infections in a low risk pregnant population in latvia.
AB  == background: to investigate the correlation of reproductive tract infections (rti) and endogenous vaginal flora at first antenatal consultation with placental histological inflammation. methods: in a follow-up study, 154 low risk women with no miscarriage risk factors were examined for the presence of neisseria gonorrhoeae, trichomonas vaginalis, chlamydia trachomatis, ureaplasma urealyticum, mycoplasma hominis, gardnerella vaginalis, streptococcus agalactiae  (gbs), staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis (gds) and bacterial vaginosis (bv). at delivery, outcome data were collected and the histology of the placenta  was studied. results: some 85 (56.3%) of all pregnant women had rti or endogenous vaginal flora. placental histological inflammation correlated with genital tract  colonisation with g. vaginalis (p =0.013), bv (p =0.031), s. aureus (p =0.04) and aerobic vaginitis (p =0.017). bv and bv-related g. vaginalis correlated with the  presence of parietal and placental chorioamnionitis in 53.8 and 43.5% of cases. genital tract colonisation with gds and other aerobic flora in combination with inflammatory vaginitis correlated with the presence of funisitis in 33.3 and 40.0% of cases. mycoplasmas increased the risk for intrauterine infection only when present in combination with other rtis (p =0.023). conclusion: histological  placental inflammation is associated with both bv and genital tract colonisation  with aerobic bacteria, while funisitis is associated with colonisation of aerobic bacteria at first prenatal visit before the 17th gestational week.

TI  == infection after the surgical treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: evaluation of the diagnosis, treatment, and impact on clinical outcomes.
AB  == study design: retrospective case-control. objective: the purpose of this study was to evaluate a single surgeon's experience with infection after surgical treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, with a focus on the diagnosis, treatment, and impact on radiographic and patient-reported outcomes. summary of background data: although previous studies have evaluated this postoperative complication, no studies to date have looked at the impact of this complication on both radiographic and patient-reported outcomes. methods: from 1986 to 2004, 236 patients were identified who underwent surgical treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and had at least 2-year follow-up. the medical records of patients who developed infection were retrospectively reviewed in detail. preoperative and most recent postoperative radiographic parameters and scoliosis  research society 24 outcomes of both infected and noninfected patients were compared. results: of 236 patients 7 (3%) developed an infection. one was acute (17 days postoperative), and 6 were delayed (average 34.2 months postoperative).  the most common presenting complaints included back pain (5 of 7) and localized swelling (4 of 7). all patients with delayed infection were treated with 1 surgery (irrigation and debridement, instrumentation removal) and 6 weeks of intravenous antibiotics. of 6 patients 3 had pseudarthrosis. culture results were: staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 2), propionibacterium acnes (n = 1), enterococcus faecalis (n = 1), group a streptococcus (n = 1), no growth (n = 1).  the patient with acute infection required 6 surgical procedures and 16 weeks of antibiotics. cultures were positive for methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus and serratia marscesens. revision fusion surgery was performed 5 months after the infection was treated. compared with the noninfected patients, those with infection had lower percent thoracic (p = 0.01) and lumbar (p = 0.06) curve  correction. there was no difference in the pain, function, self-image, satisfaction, or total scoliosis research society 24 scores. conclusion: postoperative infection after the surgical treatment of idiopathic scoliosis can  successfully be treated with irrigation and debridement, instrumentation removal, and a course of antibiotics. although less curve correction was achieved in the infected group, there were no differences in patient-reported outcomes when compared with the noninfected group.

TI  == clinical significance of nontraditional bacterial uropathogens in the management  of chronic prostatitis.
AB  == purpose: we compared the clinical benefits of eradicating traditional accepted uropathogens and nontraditional uropathogens (gram-positive bacteria other than enterococci) in prostate specific specimens in men with clinical prostatitis. materials and methods: men with prostatitis-like symptoms and any bacteria localized to prostate specific specimens were treated with levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin for 4 weeks with 6 months of followup. rates of bacterial eradication and clinical responses in group 1, who had uropathogenic localization (eg escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis), were compared to those in group  2, who had bacteria considered nonuropathogens (eg coagulase negative staphylococcus species and streptococcus species). results: of the men 261, including 146 in group 1 and 115 in group 2, were available for analyses. mean age was 51.3 years and mean symptom duration was 8.4 weeks (median 3.5). of the patients 107 (41%) had received previous antibiotic treatment. bacteria eradication rates were similar in groups 1 and 2 (74.0% and 78.3%, respectively,  p = 0.47). clinical response rates were also similar in groups 1 and 2 (76.6% and 70.4%, respectively, p = 0.26). in groups 1 and 2 there was a statistically significant correlation between clinical and microbiological outcomes (chi-square analysis correlation p = 0.0014 and 0.0055, respectively). at 6 months of followup 70.5% of successfully treated group 1 patients were still considered to  have a positive clinical response compared to 72.8% in group 2 (p = 0.75). conclusions: clinically acceptable short and long-term microbiological and clinical responses to fluoroquinolone therapy for clinical prostatitis did not depend on whether traditional uropathogenic bacteria or nontraditional uropathogens were isolated in prostate specific specimens.

TI  == comparative study of the antimicrobial efficacy of chlorhexidine gel, chlorhexidine solution and sodium hypochlorite as endodontic irrigants.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to assess the in vitro the antimicrobial efficacy of chlorhexidine gluconate gel as an endodontic auxiliary chemical substance compared to sodium hypochlorite (naocl) and chlorhexidine gluconate solution. the antimicrobial efficacy of the tested substances was evaluated using the agar diffusion test. the growth inhibition zones produced by 0.2%, 1% and 2% chlorhexidine gel were evaluated against 5 facultative anaerobic bacteria and 4 pigmented gram-negative anaerobes, and compared to the results obtained by naocl  and chlorhexidine solution. the largest growth inhibition zones were produced when the test bacteria were in contact with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate gel (11.79 mm), being significantly different (p<0.05) from the growth inhibition zones produced by all naocl concentrations, including 5.25% (9.54 mm). however, there was no statistically significant difference (p>0.05) between the growth inhibition zones obtained with equal concentrations of chlorhexidine solution and gel. the results of this study indicate that, as far as its antimicrobial properties are concerned, chlorhexidine gel has a great potential to be used as an endodontic auxiliary chemical substance.

TI  == secreted enteric antimicrobial activity localises to the mucus surface layer.
AB  == objectives: the intestinal mucosa is constantly exposed to a dense and highly dynamic microbial flora and challenged by a variety of enteropathogenic bacteria. antibacterial protection is provided in part by paneth cell-derived antibacterial peptides such as the alpha-defensins. the mechanism of peptide-mediated antibacterial control and its functional importance for gut homeostasis has recently been appreciated in patients with crohn's ileitis. in the present study, the spatial distribution of antimicrobial peptides was analysed within the small  intestinal anatomical compartments such as the intestinal crypts, the overlaying  mucus and the luminal content. methods: preparations from the different intestinal locations as well as whole mouse small intestine were extracted and separated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. antibacterial activity was determined in extracts, and the presence of antimicrobial peptides/proteins was confirmed by n-terminal sequencing, mass spectrometry analysis and immunodetection. results: the secreted antibacterial activity was largely confined to the layer of mucus, whereas only minute amounts of activity were noted in the luminal content. the extractable activity originating from either crypt/mucus/lumen compartments respectively (given as a percentage) was for listeria monocytogenes, 48 (4)/44 (4)/8 (8); enterococcus faecalis, 44 (10)/49 (3)/7 (7); bacterium megaterium, 56 (4)/42 (3)/2 (1); streptococcus pyogenes, 48 (4)/46 (3)/6 (6); escherichia coli, 46 (4)/47 (3)/7 (7); and salmonella enterica sv. typhimurium, 38 (3)/43 (7)/19 (10). a spectrum of antimicrobial peptides was identified in isolated mucus, which exhibited strong and contact-dependent antibacterial activity against both commensal and pathogenic bacteria. conclusion: these findings show that secreted antimicrobial  peptides are retained by the surface-overlaying mucus and thereby provide a combined physical and antibacterial barrier to prevent bacterial attachment and invasion. this distribution facilitates high local peptide concentration on vulnerable mucosal surfaces, while still allowing the presence of an enteric microbiota.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of dx-619, a novel des-f (6)-quinolone against clinical isolates in china.
AB  == the aim of the study was to investigate in vitro antibacterial activity and bactericidal effect of dx-619 and other nine comparators against 1,101 recently collected clinical bacterial isolates in china. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of antimicrobials were determined by a clsi recommended standard agar dilution method and the minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs)  were examined by the broth dilution method. time-kill curves against representative isolates of staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, and klebsiellia pneumoniae were also conducted. dx-619 exhibited excellent antibacterial activity against 1,101 clinical isolates, especially to multi-drug resistant gram-positive cocci. the mic(90)s of dx-619 were < or =0.016 and 0.125 mg/l against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus, 0.062 and 0.125 mg/l against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. epidermidis, respectively, which were 8-512 and 64-128 fold lower than those of comparative fluoroquinolones. the mic(90)s of dx-619 for penicillin-sensitive and -non-sensitive streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium were 0.016, 0.062, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/l, respectively. the mic(90)s of dx-619 against enterobacteriaceae (except for escherichia coli) and glucose-nonfermenting bacilli were < or =4 mg/l, which were comparable to other comparators. mbcs and time-kill curves showed that dx-619 was a potent bactericidal agent. there was no significant inoculum effect on mics. but the activities of dx-619 against s. aureus, k. pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were decreased by acidic ph and  human serum. dx-619 was a potent antibacterial compound against multi-drug resistant bacteria including gram-positive cocci, such as s. aureus and enterococci, which may warrant further exploration.

TI  == bacterial and candida albicans adhesion on rapid prototyping-produced 3d-scaffolds manufactured as bone replacement materials.
AB  == rapid prototyping (rp)-produced scaffolds are gaining increasing importance in scaffold-guided tissue engineering. microbial adhesion on the surface of replacement materials has a strong influence on healing and long-term outcome. consequently, it is important to examine the adherence of microorganisms on rp-produced scaffolds. this research focussed on manufacturing of scaffolds by 3d-bioplotting and examination of their microbial adhesion characteristics. tricalciumphosphate (tcp), calcium/sodium alginate, and poly(lactide-co-glycolic  acid) (plga) constructs were produced and used to study the adhesion of dental pathogens. six oral bacterial strains, one candida strain and human saliva were used for the adhesion studies. the number of colony forming units (cfu) were determined and scanning electron microscopy (sem) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) were performed. microorganisms adhered to all scaffolds. all strains, except for streptococcus oralis, adhered best to plga scaffolds. streptococcus oralis adhered to each of the biomaterials equally. streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis adhered best to plga scaffolds, followed by alginate and tcp. prevotella nigrescens, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus  sanguis, and candida albicans showed the highest adherence to plga, followed by tcp and alginate. in contrast, the microorganisms of saliva adhered significantly better to tcp, followed by plga and alginate. sem observations correlated with the results of the cfu determinations. clsm detected bacteria within deeper sheets of alginate. in conclusion, because of the high adherence rate of oral pathogens to the scaffolds, the application of these biomaterials for bone replacement in oral surgery could result in biomaterial-related infections. strategies to decrease microbial adherence and to prevent infections due to oral  pathogens are discussed.

AB  == linezolid is the first approved member of a new generation of antibiotics, the synthetic oxazolidinones, to become available, with a broad spectrum of in vitro  activity against gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium. it has an excellent bioavailability both intravenously and orally and a very good safety profile both in adults and in children. with regards to its antimicrobial action, linezolid has a predominantly bacteriostatic action, rather than a bacteriocidal effect and is active against gram-positive bacteria that are resistant to other antibiotics. linezolid is currently showing great promise for the treatment of multi-resistant gram-positive infections, both in the community and in a hospital setting. clinical indications so far include skin and soft tissue infections, community-acquired or nosocomial pneumonia due to mrsa, vre bacteremia and community-acquired pneumonia due to penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. we anticipate that this new generation of antimicrobial agents will provide adequate cover in the future for infections that cause significant treatment failures so far, such as vre- associated endocarditis, bone and joint multi-drug resistant infections and possibly central nervous system infections, both in adult and children populations. some patents on linezolid are also discussed in this review.

TI  == identification of lactic acid bacteria from poultry feces: evidence on anti-campylobacter and anti-listeria activities.
AB  == forty-five strains of lactic acid bacteria were isolated from poultry feces sampled from an industrial farm located in the nantes area (france), and most of  them belong to the streptococcus or lactobacillus genus according to the results  obtained by galerie api and molecular methods. the most representative lactic acid bacteria strains were screened for antibacterial compound production against 2 indicator organisms (listeria innocua f and campylobacter jejuni 11168) by means of the agar diffusion test. strain s37, identified as enterococcus faecalis, exhibited a clear anti-listerial activity and a slight anti-campylobacter activity, whereas strain s42, identified as lactobacillus reuteri, exhibited only anti-campylobacter activity. regarding the results of proteolytic, heat, and neutralizing treatments of supernatants from the aforementioned strains, we can conclude that antagonism observed is attributed to antimicrobial peptide or bacteriocin in the case of strain s37, whereas it is ascribable to a nonbacteriocin, likely a reuterin, in the case of strain s42.

AB  == the ydjc-family protein is widely distributed, from human to bacteria, but so far no three-dimensional structure and functional analysis of this family of proteins has been reported. we determined the three-dimensional structure of the ydjc homolog tthb029 at a resolution of 2.9a. the overall structure of the monomer consists of (betaalpha)-barrel fold forming a homodimer. asp21, his60, and his127 residues coordinate to mg(2+) as a possible active site. tthb029 shows structural similarity to the peptidoglycan n-acetylglucosamine deacetylase from streptococcus pneumoniae (sppgda). the active site groove of sppgda includes the  zn(2+) coordinated to asp276, his326, and his330. despite the low sequence identity, metal-binding residues of asp-his-his were conserved among the two enzymes. there were definitive differences, however, in that one of the histidines of the metal-binding site was substituted for the other histidine located on the other loop. moreover, these important metal-binding residues and the residues of the presumed active site are fully conserved in ydjc-family protein.

TI  == a class iia peptide from enterococcus mundtii inhibits bacteria associated with otitis media.
AB  == peptide st4sa, produced by enterococcus mundtii st4sa, inhibits the growth of acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and gram-positive bacteria isolated from patients diagnosed with middle ear infections. the peptide adsorbed at a level of 94% to s. pneumoniae 40, pseudomonas aeruginosa 25 and e. faecium hklhs. low concentrations of peptide st4sa (51200 arbitrary units (au)/ml) caused dna and enzyme leakage from target cells, whilst 1638400au/ml caused cell lysis.  no decrease in antimicrobial activity was observed when tested on solid medium with human blood as base. peptide st4sa revealed a similar level of activity compared with tetracycline (30 microg), but much higher activity compared with nasal sprays, aminoglycosides, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, lincosamides, macrolides, nitroimidazole, penicillin, quinolones, sulphonamides, chloramphenicol, furazolidone, fusidic acid, rifampicin, trimethoprim, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin when tested in vitro. peptide st4sa  dissipates the proton-motive force and may be used in the treatment of multidrug-resistant strains where antibiotics are excluded from cells by efflux pumps dependent on the membrane proton gradient.

TI  == antimicrobial effects of piper guineense 'uziza' and phyllantus amarus 'ebe-benizo' on candida albicans and streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == two pathogens were employed, streptococcus faecalis and candida albicans for the  study of the antimicrobial effects of piper guineense and phyllantus amarus using agar-well diffusion and disc-diffusion methods. phytochemical screening of ethanol, cold and hot water extracts detected the presence of tannins, saponins,  flavonoids, terpenoids and phlobatannins. antimicrobial effect of the plant extracts showed that the organic solvent and aqueous solvents of p. amarus were inhibitory to s. faecalis while the extracts of phyllantus amarus were not inhibitory to candida albicans. agar-well determined minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values ranged between 3.125 mg/ml and 6.25 mg/ml while the disc diffusion determined mic values ranged between 6.25 mg/ml and 25.0 mg/ml. the agar-well determined mic values for the ethanolic p. amarus extracts (3.12 mg/ml) were lower than the corresponding disc-diffusion mic determined values (6.25 mg/ml-25.00 mg/ml). bacteriocidal and bacteriostatic effect varied with, solvent type of extract, concentration of the plant extract and the method of the test adopted. the active components of the plant have no antifungal effect on the tested yeast (candida albicans). these findings are discussed in relation to plant chemicals as a means of disease control and also to the problem of microbial resistance to synthetic drugs.

TI  == effect of photo-activated disinfection on endodontic pathogens ex vivo.
AB  == aim: to test the hypothesis that photo-activated disinfection (pad) has a bactericidal effect on pathogens inoculated in root canals, with emphasis on biofilm formation/destruction. methodology: root canals of extracted teeth (n = 38) were prepared (size 30, 0.10 taper), autoclaved, divided into three groups and two negative controls inoculated (streptococcus anginosus, enterococcus faecalis or fusobacterium nucleatum) and treated (pad, laser, dye or positive control) according to a cross-sectional design. resultant colony-forming unit counts were associated with observations of cell structural changes using environmental scanning electron microscopy (esem) on inoculated dentinal surfaces (n = 22, two controls) before (1, 2 and 6 days of incubation) and after treatment with pad. results: treatment of root canals with pad (15 j) caused a significant  reduction of the bacterial load, resulting in a 93.8% kill of s. anginosus (p < 0.0001), a 88.4% kill of e. faecalis (p < 0.05) and a 98.5% kill of f. nucleatum  (p < 0.0001), but no sterilization. laser alone had no significant effect on the  load nor did the dye without laser. the esem experiment showed that individual cells or monolayers were easily eliminated with pad. but when biofilms were present (2 and 6 days for e. faecalis, 6 days for s. anginosus), bacterial eradication was substantially reduced in deep layers. conclusions: photo-activated disinfection is not an alternative but a possible supplement to the existing protocols for root canal disinfection as the interaction between light (diode laser) and associated dye (tbo) provides a broad-spectrum effect. some endodontic pathogens that grow as single-species biofilms, however, are difficult to eradicate.

TI  == antibacterial activity of triterpene acids and semi-synthetic derivatives against oral pathogens.
AB  == triterpene acids (ursolic, oleanoic, gypsogenic, and sumaresinolic acids) isolated from miconia species, along with a mixture of ursolic and oleanolic acids and a mixture of maslinic and 2-a-hydroxyursolic acids, as well as ursolic  acid derivatives were evaluated against the following microorganisms: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, and enterococcus faecalis, which are potentially responsible for the formation of dental caries in humans. the microdilution method was used for the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) during the evaluation of the antibacterial activity. all the  isolated compounds, mixtures, and semi-synthetic derivatives displayed activity against all the tested bacteria, showing that they are promising antiplaque and anticaries agents. ursolic and oleanolic acids displayed the most intense antibacterial effect, with mic values ranging from 30 microg/ml to 80 microg/ml.  the mic values of ursolic acid derivatives, as well as those obtained for the mixture of ursolic and oleanolic acids showed that these compounds do not have higher antibacterial activity when compared with the activity observed with either ursolic acid or oleanolic acid alone. with regard to the structure-activity relationship of triterpene acids and derivatives, it is suggested that both hydroxy and carboxy groups present in the triterpenes are important for their antibacterial activity against oral pathogens.

TI  == effect of tissue fluids on hydrophobicity and adherence of enterococcus faecalis  to dentin.
AB  == this in vitro study was carried out to determine (1) the hydrophobicity of selected oral bacteria, (2) the influence of growth media (saliva and serum) and  mode of growth (planktonic or biofilm) on the hydrophobicity of enterococcus faecalis, and (3) the influence of growth media and conditioning fluids on the adherence of e. faecalis to dentin. the ability to bind to a hydrocarbon phase (xylene) was used as an index of relative hydrophobicity of cells. fluorescent microscopy-based technique was used to assay the bacterial adherence to dentin. results showed that bacteria involved in the primary stage of oral biofilm formation such as streptococcus mutans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis are relatively more hydrophobic than e. faecalis. the hydrophobicity of e. faecalis was significantly increased during starvation and biofilm mode of growth (p < .05). the adherence of e. faecalis to dentin was appreciably increased after starvation and when dentin was conditioned with saliva. it was observed that surface conditioning of dentin with saliva and starvation can enhance the adherence of e. faecalis to dentin. the findings from  this study indicated that the coronal leakage of saliva and the physiologic state of microbes might play an important role in the adherence and biofilm formation of bacteria to root canal dentin.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance in 11 hospitals in puerto rico: results of an antimicrobial resistance management (arm) program.
AB  == purpose: the antimicrobial resistance management program (armp) was established in 1997 at the university of florida as an ongoing project to document trends in  antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in inpatient/outpatient isolates and track  resistance that may occur with specific antibiotic use. methods: institutions are enrolled at no charge and provide a minimum of 3 years of antibiogram/sensitivity report data, which are reviewed to create a customized analysis of antimicrobial  susceptibility trends benchmarked against national/regional comparators. the data, in a hipaa-compliant non-identifying format, comprise a national aggregate  database of 28.4 million isolates from 358 institutions. this database was interrogated to determine resistance rates for eleven hospitals in puerto rico from 1998-2003 and, as comparators, those in the database from the state of florida and all u.s. institutions. results: between 1996-2003, data on 328,837 isolates collected from 11 hospitals throughout puerto rico, 5,388,897 isolates from 46 institutions in florida, and 24,951,098 isolates from 358 u.s. institutions for the following organisms (number of antibiotics tested against) were reviewed for susceptibility: coagulase-negative staphylococci (14)/staphylococcus epidermidis (18), enterococcus faecalis (7), enterococcus faecium (5), enterococcus species (4), escherichia coli (24), klebsiella pneumoniae (24), proteus mirabilis (22), pseudomonas aeruginosa (14), serratia marcescens (22), staphylococcus aureus (23), and streptococcus pneumoniae (9). antimicrobial resistance in puerto rico varied organism to organism from that observed in florida and nationally. conclusions: this first broad analysis of antimicrobial resistance in puerto rico provides important baseline data, both for sentinel surveillance programs and for determining strategies for intervention.

TI  == genetic features of circular bacteriocins produced by gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == this review highlights the main genetic features of circular bacteriocins, which  require the co-ordinated expression of several genetic determinants. in general terms, it has been demonstrated that the expression of such structural genes must be combined with the activity of proteins involved in maturation (cleavage/circularization) and secretion outside the cell via different transporter systems, as well as multifaceted immunity mechanisms essential to ensuring the bacteria's self-protection against such strong inhibitors. several circular antibacterial peptides produced by gram-positive bacteria have been described to date, including enterocin as-48, from enterococcus faecalis s-48 (the first one characterized), gassericin a, from lactobacillus gasseri la39, and a similar one, reutericin 6, from lactobacillus reuteri la6, butyrivibriocin ar10, from the ruminal anaerobe butyrivibrio fibrisolvens ar10, uberolysin, from  streptococcus uberis, circularin a, from clostridium beijerinckii atcc 25752, and subtilosin a, from bacillus subtilis. we summarize here the progress made in the  understanding of their principal genetic features over the last few years, during which the functional roles of circular proteins with wide biological activity have become clearer.

TI  == improved diagnosis specificity in bone and joint infections using molecular techniques.
AB  == objectives: the microbiological diagnosis of osteoarticular infections currently  relies on microbiological cultures, to specifically target treatment. however, these conventional methods sometimes lack of sensitivity and of specificity to establish definitive diagnosis. this study was conducted to determine whether molecular method could improve bacterial bone and joint infection diagnosis. methods: we evaluated the performance of nucleic acid extraction with the semi-automated nuclisens minimag instrument coupled to 16s rdna sequencing on 76  samples collected from 51 patients with suspected infections: prosthetic-joint infection (15), spondylodiscitis (7) acute septic arthritis (11) and 18 controls. no pre-treatment of the sample was done before nucleic acid extraction. classification in infected group required an accumulation of arguments. results:  our molecular method identified a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and fastidious bacteria like neisseria gonorrhoeae and fusobacterium  nucleatum. the overall pcr sensitivity was 73.3%: 53.8% for prosthetic-joint infections and 88.2% for infections without prostheses. the overall pcr specificity was 95.2%, whereas culture specificity was only 85.7%. conclusions: the instrument was simple to use and provided nucleic acids free of pcr inhibitors and free of contamination by foreign bacterial dna. our study highlights the need for still improved molecular diagnostic sensitivity.

TI  == a genome-wide survey of short coding sequences in streptococci.
AB  == identification of short genes that encode peptides of fewer than 60 aa is challenging, both experimentally and in silico. as a consequence, the universe of these short coding sequences (cdss) remains largely unknown, although some are acknowledged to play important roles in cell-cell communication, particularly in  gram-positive bacteria. this paper reports a thorough search for short cdss across streptococcal genomes. our bioinformatic approach relied on a combination  of advanced intrinsic and extrinsic methods. in the first step, intrinsic sequence information (nucleotide composition and presence of rbss) served to identify new short putative cdss (spcdss) and to eliminate the differences between annotation policies. in the second step, pseudogene fragments and false predictions were filtered out. the last step consisted of screening the remaining spcdss for lines of extrinsic evidence involving sequence and gene-context comparisons. a total of 789 spcdss across 20 complete genomes (19 streptococcus and one enterococcus) received the support of at least one line of extrinsic evidence, which corresponds to an average of 20 short cdss per million base pairs. most of these had no known function, and a significant fraction (31%) are  not even annotated as hypothetical genes in genbank records. as an illustration of the value of this list, we describe a new family of cdss, encoding very short  hydrophobic peptides (20-23 aa) situated just upstream of some of the positive transcriptional regulators of the rgg family. the expression of seven other short cdss from streptococcus thermophilus cnrz1066 that encode peptides ranging in length from 41 to 56 aa was confirmed by real-time quantitative rt-pcr and revealed a variety of expression patterns. finally, one peptide from this list, encoded by a gene that is not annotated in genbank, was identified in a cell-envelope-enriched fraction of s. thermophilus cnrz1066.

TI  == postoperative pneumonia after major pulmonary resections: an unsolved problem in  thoracic surgery.
AB  == background: antibiotics currently recommended for prophylaxis in thoracic surgery are first-generation and second-generation cephalosporins. despite this prophylaxis, postoperative pneumonia after major pulmonary resections remains frequent and severe. however, in the medical literature, the origin of these infections is poorly documented. methods: to evaluate the efficiency of current prophylactic regimens, we retrospectively analyzed 312 consecutive cases of major pulmonary resection, performed between january 2000 and december 2004. for patients who experienced postoperative pulmonary infection, the microbiologic agents and their antibiotic susceptibility were studied. results: a postoperative pneumonia was diagnosed in 76 patients (24.4% +/- 0.43%). sixty patients (78.9%)  experienced the infection in the first 5 postoperative days. a microbiologic documentation was obtained in 44 cases (57.9%) with 56 microorganisms involved. pathogens responsible for the infections were staphylococcus aureus (n = 10), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 8), group b streptococcus organisms (n = 1), nongroupable streptococcus organisms (n = 2), enterococcus faecalis (n = 1), haemophilus spp. (n = 9), branhamella catarrhalis (n = 2), enterobacteriaceae (n  = 15), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 3), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 1), and candida spp. (n = 4). according to the antibiotic susceptibility testings, the prophylactic regimen by cefazolin proved ineffective for 84% of the microbiologically documented cases. conclusions: this study confirmed the inefficiency of current prophylaxis against pathogens involved in postoperative pneumonia after major lung resections. evaluation of new and more-adapted approaches of antibiotic prophylaxis should be the subject of prospective multicenter trials.

TI  == redox potential to discriminate among species of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == aims: to verify to what degree reducing capacity is a characterizing parameter of a species, and of the strains themselves within a given species, of lactic acid bacteria. methods and results: eighty-eight strains belonging to 10 species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from traditional italian cheeses were studied for their reduction activity: enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis,  lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus helveticus and pediococcus pentosaceus. it was observed that the lactococci reached minimum redox potential  before the lactobacilli. the reduction rate of enterococcus spp. and l. lactis ssp. lactis was higher than that of the streptococci and lactobacillus spp. all the p. pentosaceus strains had poor reduction activity compared with the other species. conclusions: the evolution of the redox potential in milk over a time span of 24 h has been found to be a parameter that characterizes a species: the different courses corresponding to the species in question are clearly evident, and interesting differences can also be noted within the same species. significance and impact of the study: the reduction aptitude of strains might be  used to select and adapt appropriate strains for use as starters for dairy products.

TI  == controlled release of vancomycin from cross-linked gelatine.
AB  == this paper explores the possibility of using biodegradable cross-linked gelatines as antibiotic devices for a long-term elution (80 days). capillary electrophoresis (ce) has been utilized to evaluate the mass percentage of vancomycin and gelatine contemporary released from differently cross-linked vancomycin loaded gelatine samples in an elution time ranging from 24 to 1920 h.  while the solubilization kinetic of gelatine samples differently cross-linked can be very close described by the simplified higuchi model, the vancomycin release kinetic is contemporary governed by both the fickian diffusion process trough the gelatine matrix network and the dissolution process of the matrix due to its degradation. comparing the antibiotic eluting kinetics from gelatine at diverse cross-linking degree we observed that the degradation of the proteic matrix appears to have a minor influence in the drug release control. vancomycin released from all the gelatine partially cross-linked samples results active against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis which represent the most pathogens commonly isolated in orthopaedic infections. vancomycin overcomes the minimum inhibitory concentration for both the bacteria in the whole range of elution time. cross-linked gelatine devices appear to represent a useful biodegradable delivery system for local anti-infective therapy in arthoplasty.

AB  == unlike the colicins, microcins and related peptide antibiotics, little is known about antibiotic proteins (m(r)>10,000) from gram-positive bacteria, since only few examples have been described to date. in this study we used heterologous expression of recombinant proteins to access the 17 kda antibiotic protein sa-m57 from streptococcus pyogenes, along with two proteins of unknown function identified in publicly available databases: ef1097 from enterococcus faecalis and ypkk from corynebacterium jeikeium. here we show that all three are antibiotic proteins with different spectra of antimicrobial activity that kill sensitive bacteria at nanomolar concentrations. in silico structure predictions indicate that although the three proteins share little sequence similarity, they may be composed of conserved secondary structural elements: a relatively unstructured, acidic n-terminal portion and a basic c-terminal portion characterized by two helical elements separated by a loop structure and stabilized by an essential disulphide. expression of individual segments as well as protein chimaeras revealed that, at least in the case of ypkk, the c-terminal portion is responsible for the killing action of the protein, whereas the role of the n-terminal portion remains unclear. both scnm57 and ef1097 appear to be widely distributed in strep. pyogenes and ent. faecalis (respectively), whereas ypkk is  found only rarely amongst clinical isolates of c. jeikeium. finally, we determined that the proteins kill sensitive bacteria without lysis, a feature that distinguishes them from known murolytic proteins.

TI  == antibody binding to streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis cell fractions.
AB  == objective: to determine which cell fraction(s) of streptococcus mitis biovar 1 serve as the best source of antigens recognized by salivary siga antibodies in infants. design: whole cells of 38 reference and wild-type isolates of s. mitis,  streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, enterococcus casseliflavus, and enterococcus faecalis were fractionated into cell walls (cw), protease-treated cell walls (ptcw), cell membranes (cm) and cell protein (cp). whole cells and these fractions were tested for binding by rabbit anti-s. mitis sk145 and anti-s. oralis sk100 sera, and also by salivary siga antibodies from infants and adults.  results: anti-sk145 and anti-sk100 sera bound whole cells and fractions of all strains of s. mitis and s. oralis variably. cluster analysis of antibody binding  data placed the strains into s. mitis, s. oralis and 'non-s. mitis/non-s. oralis' clusters. antigens from cw and cm best discriminated s. mitis from s. oralis. cm  bound the most infant salivary siga antibody and ptcw bound the least. in contrast, adult salivary siga antibody bound all of the cell fractions and at higher levels. conclusions: presumably the relatively short period of immune stimulation and immunological immaturity in infants, in contrast to adults, result in low levels of salivary siga antibody that preferentially bind cm of s.  mitis but not ptcw. by utilizing isolated cell walls and membranes as sources of  antigens for proteomics it may be possible to identify antigens common to oral streptococci and dissect the fine specificity of salivary siga antibodies induced by oral colonization by s. mitis.

TI  == characterization of the organ donor with bacteremia.
AB  == introduction: the presence of bloodstream infection in the donor is a common finding that could be transmitted to the recipient. to safely expand the donor pool, we examined its relevance. materials and methods: we described the clinical characteristics of organ donors grafted in our center between 1997 and 2006 who had bacteremia detected in blood cultures obtained during organ procurement. results: among 1353 organ donors, 75 were non-heart-beating donors type ii and the others brain-dead donors. only 186 donors (14%) showed bacteremia during retrieval. this mean age was 49.8 years (range 12 to 86 years, sd 18) including 63% men. causes of death were cerebrovascular accident in 60%; craneoencephalic trauma, 25%; and other causes, 15%. the average length of the intensive care unit stay was 3 days (interquartile range: 2 to 7 days). twenty-nine percent of donors presented previous infectious complications (90% from respiratory origin). the most prevalent pathogen isolated in blood cultures was coagulase negative staphylococci (46,2%), followed by s aureus (15%), streptococcus group viridans (9.1%), enterobacteria (9%), enterococcus faecalis (7.5%) and gram-negative bacilli nonfermentative (6.2%). in 3.1%, the bloodstream infections were polymicrobial. the bronchial aspiration cultures were positive in 50% of cases and the urine culture in 8,6%. in 17% of donors the isolated microorganism was coincident between blood and bronchial cultures. pseudomonas spp and s aureus were more common than the others (p = .004 and p = .058, respectively). conclusions: the incidence of bacteremia in our cohort was 14%. the respiratory tract was the most common clinical focus. pseudomonas spp or s aureus isolated in bronchial cultures are risk factors to develop bacteremia. according to these findings, it is important to start specific antibiotics against those microorganisms in the donor and the recipients.

TI  == isolation and characterization of unsaturated fatty acid auxotrophs of streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus mutans.
AB  == unsaturated fatty acid (ufa) biosynthesis is essential for the maintenance of membrane structure and function in many groups of anaerobic bacteria. like escherichia coli, the human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae produces straight-chain saturated fatty acids (sfa) and monounsaturated fatty acids. in e. coli ufa synthesis requires the action of two gene products, the essential isomerase/dehydratase encoded by faba and an elongation condensing enzyme encoded by fabb. s. pneumoniae lacks both genes and instead employs a single enzyme with  only an isomerase function encoded by the fabm gene. in this paper we report the  construction and characterization of an s. pneumoniae 708 fabm mutant. this mutant failed to grow in complex medium, and the defect was overcome by addition  of ufas to the growth medium. s. pneumoniae fabm mutants did not produce detectable levels of monounsaturated fatty acids as determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and thin-layer chromatography analysis of the radiolabeled phospholipids. we also demonstrate that a fabm null mutant of the cariogenic organism streptococcus mutants is a ufa auxotroph, indicating that fabm is the only enzyme involved in the control of membrane fluidity in streptococci. finally we report that the fabn gene of enterococcus faecalis, coding for a dehydratase/isomerase, complements the growth of s. pneumoniae fabm  mutants. taken together, these results suggest that fabm is a potential target for chemotherapeutic agents against streptococci and that s. pneumoniae ufa auxotrophs could help identify novel genes encoding enzymes involved in ufa biosynthesis.

AB  == we evaluated the usefulness of an early-harvested bacterial cell suspension to the fully automated raisus (nissui pharmaceuticals co., ltd., tokyo) to provide the results of species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testings within a day after overnight-incubation of the primary cultures. a single, well-separated colony appeared on the primary culture plate was transferred onto  a blood agar or chocolate agar plates, then incubated for 3 to 6 hours. the cell  suspension to the raisus was properly prepared to the mcfarland 0.5 turbidity from the early-harvested bacterial cells. when the five atcc reference strains, consisting of staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, streptococcus pneumoniae atcc 49619, escherichia coli atcc 25922 and pseudomonas  aeruginosa atcc 27853, were repeatedly tested for the species-identification, all the identification results were acceptable. antimicrobial susceptibility tests were evaluated with the above five strains and haemophilus influenzae atcc 49247. the results obtained indicated that the most susceptibility test results were comparable to those mics obtained by the standard test procedure, but some strains, in particular, h. influenzae and p. aeruginosa gave significantly discrepant mics for certain antimicrobial agents. the significant discrepancy in  mic determinations regarded the difference of viable cell concentrations in the cell suspension prepared respectively. through the analysis of laboratory workflow, it became to apparent that 18s to 20s of the tests were completed by 5:00 p.m., and it required to wait until 3:00 a.m. to complete 90s of the tests.  with these results, the early-harvested bacterial cell suspension is applicable to species-identification by raisus, but it is necessary to adjust viable cell concentrations to antimicrobial susceptibility test. also, it is urgent to reconstitute a daily workflow to improve the rapidity of raisus test function.

TI  == enterococcus faecalis constitutes an unusual bacterial model in lysozyme resistance.
AB  == lysozyme is an important and widespread compound of the host constitutive defense system, and it is assumed that enterococcus faecalis is one of the few bacteria that are almost completely lysozyme resistant. on the basis of the sequence analysis of the whole genome of e. faecalis v583 strain, we identified two genes  that are potentially involved in lysozyme resistance, ef_0783 and ef_1843. protein products of these two genes share significant homology with staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan o-acetyltransferase (oata) and streptococcus  pneumoniae n-acetylglucosamine deacetylase (pgda), respectively. in order to determine whether ef_0783 and ef_1843 are involved in lysozyme resistance, we constructed their corresponding mutants and a double mutant. the deltaef_0783 mutant and deltaef_0783 deltaef_1843 double mutant were shown to be more sensitive to lysozyme than the parental e. faecalis jh2-2 strain and deltaef_1843 mutant were. however, compared to other bacteria, such as listeria monocytogenes  or s. pneumoniae, the tolerance of deltaef_0783 and deltaef_0783 deltaef_1843 mutants towards lysozyme remains very high. peptidoglycan structure analysis showed that ef_0783 modifies the peptidoglycan by o acetylation of n-acetyl muramic acid, while the ef_1843 deletion has no obvious effect on peptidoglycan structure under the same conditions. moreover, the ef_0783 and ef_1843 deletions  seem to significantly affect the ability of e. faecalis to survive within murine  macrophages. in all, while ef_0783 is currently involved in the lysozyme resistance of e. faecalis, peptidoglycan o acetylation and de-n-acetylation are not the main mechanisms conferring high levels of lysozyme resistance to e. faecalis.

TI  == penetration of gatifloxacin eye drops into the aqueous humor in humans.
AB  == the authors topically administered gatifloxacin (gflx) into the eye before cataract surgery and measured the concentrations of this agent to determine its penetration into aqueous humor. seventy-seven patients with age-related cataracts who underwent cataract surgery were enrolled in this study. they received 0.3% gflx ophthalmic solution 4 times at 30-min intervals, beginning 2 h before surgery. aqueous humor was aspirated from the anterior chamber and assayed for gflx concentration using high-performance liquid chromatography. the mean intraoperative gflx concentration in aqueous humor was 0.485 +/- 0.328 microg/ml. gflx level was 0.573 +/- 0.367 microg/ml in elderly patients, at least 70 years of age, and was significantly higher than that (0.322 +/- 0.135 microg/ml) in the patients less than 70 years old. this concentration was close to or higher than the minimum inhibitory concentrations required to inhibit the growth of 90% of major pathogens of endophthalmitis (mic90), such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis associated with poor prognosis, other than staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and mrsa (methicillin-resistant s. aureus) in vitro. the gflx concentrations found in aqueous humor samples were sufficient to kill bacteria other than s. epidermidis, p. aeruginosa, and mrsa in vitro.

AB  == background: although many patients with ie complain of joint, muscle, and back pain, infections at these sights are rare. indeed, in patients with back pain and endocarditis, less than 4% actually demonstrate spondylodiscitis. case description: we recently encountered 4 patients with this complication, one each  caused by staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus mitis, and enterococcus faecalis, and wondered whether the nature of the infecting organism  determined the development of spondylodiscitis and epidural abscess. in a literature review, 36 patients with endocarditis and spondylodiscitis were identified. only 9 (25%) were caused by streptococcus viridans and the remainder  by staphylococci, enterococci, and other streptococci. usually more than 50% of all cases of ie were caused by streptococcus viridans, although more recent studies would indicate an incidence of about 40%. conclusion: we conclude that spondylodiscitis with epidural abscess is more likely to occur in those patients  with endocarditis who are infected by organisms with pyogenic potential.

TI  == qsar studies on benzoylaminobenzoic acid derivatives as inhibitors of beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase iii.
AB  == fatty acid biosynthesis is essential for most of the bacterial survival. components of this biosynthetic pathway have been identified as attractive targets for the development of new antibacterial agents. fabh, beta-ketoacyl-acp  synthase iii, is a attractive target since it is central to the initiation of fatty acid biosynthesis. quantitative structure-activity relationship (qsar) studies have been carried out on a series of benzoylaminobenzoic acid derivatives as potent inhibitors of fabh and antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis,  neisseria meningitidis and escherichia coli, which demonstrate fabh inhibitory activity in cell free and whole cell system. the qsar studies revealed that inhibitory activity increases with increase in hydrophobicity, molar refractivity, aromaticity, and presence of oh group (on x position of the nucleus). on the other side presence of hetero-atoms like n, o, or s at r(1) position of the nucleus decreases the inhibitory activity. the comparison of qsar between the fabh inhibitory activity and antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, e. faecalis, n. meningitidis also demonstrates that the hydrophobicity, aromaticity and presence of oh group (on x  position of the nucleus) are conducive for the inhibitory activity.

TI  == factors influencing broth microdilution antimicrobial susceptibility test results for dalbavancin, a new glycopeptide agent.
AB  == performance of antimicrobial susceptibility tests with new agents requires careful consideration of the properties of the antimicrobial to ensure that the tests are standardized, reproducible, and reflect the true potency of the drug. dalbavancin is a new glycopeptide with potent activity against gram-positive bacterial species. the investigations described here demonstrated that methodologic modifications of procedures are necessary to ensure consistent test  results, both for quality control and for routine testing of clinical isolates. dimethyl sulfoxide is the preferred primary solvent. the addition of 0.002% polysorbate-80 (a surfactant) to dalbavancin-containing wells in the reference broth microdilution assay resulted in consistent and reproducible mic results for three quality control strains: staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, and streptococcus pneumoniae atcc 49619. the same degree of  consistency was observed among clinical isolates of gram-positive bacterial species tested in several clinical laboratories. these results indicate that the  addition of 0.002% (final concentration) of the surfactant in broth microdilution tests produces optimal dalbavancin mics required for accurate and reproducible clinical laboratory tests, without untoward influences of substrate binding or media constituents.

TI  == enterococci and streptococci.
AB  == besides staphylococcus aureus, other gram-positive bacteria have become multidrug-resistant and cause therapeutic problems, particularly amongst hospitalised patients. the acquisition of vancomycin resistance by strains of enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis is of particular concern and has resulted in treatment failures. some of the infections caused by these bacteria do respond to treatment with new antibiotics that have been released in the last  few years, however more options are required as not all enterococci are inherently susceptible and resistance is beginning to emerge amongst those that were susceptible. resistance to commonly used antibiotics is also emerging in streptococcus spp., particularly to the tetracyclines and macrolides. in both genera, multiresistant strains spread between patients and between hospitals. in  the laboratory, these bacteria show considerable susceptibility to tigecycline, with little propensity to develop resistance, indicating that tigecycline could assume an important role in controlling infections caused by these gram-positive  bacteria.

AB  == this study was undertaken to test the in vitro activity of tigecycline against 117 clinically relevant gram-positive pathogens and to correlate this activity with their resistance gene content. overall, tigecycline showed a minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) range of 0.015-0.5mg/l, able to inhibit potently all multiresistant streptococci, enterococci and mr staphylococci. tigecycline was active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and enterococci, with mics for 90% of the organisms (mic(90)) of 0.25 mg/l and 0.12 mg/l, respectively, being more active than linezolid (mic(90)=2 mg/l) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (mic(90)=0.5 and 2-4 mg/l, respectively). molecular characterisation of resistance determinants demonstrated the concomitant presence of different classes of genes: in particular, tet(m), erm(b) and erm(c) in streptococcus agalactiae; tet(o), variably associated with different erm genes, in streptococcus pyogenes; vana, tet(m) and erm(b) in enterococcus faecalis, and  vana and erm(b) in enterococcus faecium. all the mrsa strains harboured sccmec and erm genes and 50% possessed tet(k) with tet(m) genes. staphylococcus epidermidis strains were only resistant to erythromycin. these results clearly demonstrate that tigecycline has a mic(90) range of 0.015-0.5 mg/l both against tetracycline-susceptible and -resistant isolates carrying other resistance determinants, suggesting that this drug could play an important role in the treatment of infections caused by these multiresistant gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == characterization and mechanistic studies of type ii isopentenyl diphosphate:dimethylallyl diphosphate isomerase from staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == the recently identified type ii isopentenyl diphosphate (ipp):dimethylallyl diphosphate (dmapp) isomerase (idi-2) is a flavoenzyme that requires fmn and nad(p)h for activity. idi-2 is an essential enzyme for the biosynthesis of isoprenoids in several pathogenic bacteria including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis, and thus is considered as a  potential new drug target to battle bacterial infections. one notable feature of  the idi-2 reaction is that there is no net change in redox state between the substrate (ipp) and product (dmapp), indicating that the fmn cofactor must start  and finish each catalytic cycle in the same redox state. here, we report the characterization and initial mechanistic studies of the s. aureus idi-2. the steady-state kinetic analyses under aerobic and anaerobic conditions show that fmn must be reduced to be catalytically active and the overall idi-2 reaction is  o2-sensitive. interestingly, our results demonstrate that nadph is needed only in catalytic amounts to activate the enzyme for multiple turnovers of ipp to dmapp.  the hydride transfer from nad(p)h to reduce fmn is determined to be pro-s stereospecific. photoreduction and oxidation-reduction potential studies reveal that the s. aureus idi-2 can stabilize significant amounts of the neutral fmn semiquinone. in addition, reconstitution of apo-idi-2 with 5-deazafmn resulted in a dead enzyme, whereas reconstitution with 1-deazafmn led to the full recovery of enzyme activity. taken together, these studies appear to support a catalytic mechanism in which the reduced flavin coenzyme mediates a single electron transfer to and from the ipp substrate during catalysis.

AB  == background: ceftaroline (ppi-0903m, t-91825) is a novel cephalosporin, administered as an n-phosphono prodrug. we investigated its in vitro activity and resistance selection potential. methods: mics were determined by clsi agar dilution, but with varied inocula. mutant selection was investigated in single- and multi-step procedures. results: mics for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) were 0.5-2 mg/l, compared with 0.12-0.25 mg/l for methicillin-susceptible s. aureus; corresponding values for coagulase-negative staphylococci were 0.25-2 and 0.06-0.12 mg/l, respectively. even with 2% nacl added, all mrsa were susceptible at 2 mg/l. mics for enterococcus faecalis were from 0.25 to 8 mg/l; e. faecium was resistant. mics for escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., morganella morganii and proteeae without acquired resistance were 0.06-0.5 mg/l versus 0.12-1 mg/l for enterobacter, serratia and citrobacter  spp. and 2-8 mg/l for acinetobacter spp. mics rose to 1-2 mg/l for many enterobacteriaceae with classical tem beta-lactamases, and were much higher for those with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls), hyperproduced ampc or k1 enzymes. mics for strains with classical tem/shv beta-lactamases rose if the inoculum was increased to 10(6) cfu/spot; this effect was even more marked for those with esbls. resistance due to class a beta-lactamases was reversed by clavulanate. geometric mean mics were 0.005, 0.05 and 0.09 mg/l for penicillin-susceptible, -intermediate and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae strains, respectively-lower than for any comparator beta-lactam. haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis were very susceptible, although with marginally raised mics for beta-lactamase-positive moraxella strains and for haemophili with chromosomal ampicillin resistance. ceftaroline selected ampc-derepressed enterobacter mutants similarly to cefotaxime in single-step experiments; in multi-step procedures it selected esbl variants of blatem in e. coli. resistance selection was not seen with s. aureus, h. influenzae or pneumococci. conclusions: ceftaroline has impressive anti-mrsa and anti-pneumococcal activity. slight lability to classical tem and shv beta-lactamases is exceptional for an oxyimino-cephalosporin, but was reversible  with clavulanate, as was the greater resistance mediated by esbls. resistance selection occurred with enterobacteriaceae, not mrsa.

TI  == synthesis and preliminary biological characterization of new semisynthetic derivatives of ramoplanin.
AB  == ramoplanin is a glycolipodepsipeptide antibiotic active against gram-positive bacteria including vancomycin-resistant enterococci. ramoplanin inhibits bacterial cell wall biosynthesis by a mechanism different from that of glycopeptides and hence does not show cross-resistance with these antibiotics. the systemic use of ramoplanin has been so far prevented because of its low local tolerability when injected intravenously. to overcome this problem, the fatty acid side chain of ramoplanin was selectively removed and replaced with a variety of different carboxylic acids. many of the new ramoplanin derivatives showed antimicrobial activity similar to that of the natural precursor coupled with a significantly improved local tolerability. among them the derivative in which the 2-methylphenylacetic acid has replaced the di-unsaturated fatty acid side chain (48) was selected as the most interesting compound and submitted to further in vitro and in vivo characterization studies.

AB  == medical centres in eight countries in the asia-pacific region provided 2391 isolates for the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program during 2003-2004 to determine their susceptibility to several antimicrobial classes, including daptomycin. daptomycin, vancomycin and teicoplanin minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) were determined for 120 isolates of staphylococcus aureus, which included wild-type (wt) methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and strains with decreased susceptibility to vancomycin (hetero-vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus (hvisa)).  oxacillin-resistant staphylococcal isolates were much less susceptible to the other tested agents compared with oxacillin-susceptible strains. vancomycin resistance was higher among enterococcus faecium (10.3%) than enterococcus faecalis (0.4%), and macrolide resistance was high both for beta-haemolytic (17.7%) and viridans group (48.7%) streptococci. daptomycin (mic for 90% of the organisms (mic(90))=0.5-1mg/l) was two-fold more potent than vancomycin, with >99% susceptibility when tested against staphylococci. all tested isolates of e.  faecalis (mic(90)=2mg/l) and beta-haemolytic streptococci (mic(90)=0.5mg/l) were  susceptible to daptomycin. daptomycin mic and mbc values were slightly higher for the hvisa isolates compared with wt-mrsa, with mbc/mic ratios of only 1-2 for both groups. the mbc/mic ratio for vancomycin was often greater when tested against these strains, particularly hvisa. in contrast, teicoplanin mbc/mic ratios were significantly higher, with many of the strains showing values consistent with tolerance (>or=32). daptomycin was demonstrated to have excellent in vitro activity when tested against gram-positive isolates collected from asia-pacific countries, including hvisa strains.

TI  == drug susceptibility testing of clinical isolates of streptococci and enterococci  by the phoenix automated microbiology system.
AB  == background: drug resistance is an emerging problem among streptococcal and enterococcal species. automated diagnostic systems for species identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (ast) have become recently available. we evaluated drug susceptibility of clinical isolates of streptococci and enterococci using the recent phoenix system (bd, sparks, md). diagnostic tools included the new smic/id-2 panel for streptococci, and the pmic/id-14 for enterococci. two-hundred and fifty isolates have been investigated: beta-hemolytic streptococci (n = 65), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 50), viridans group streptococci (n = 32), enterococcus faecium (n = 40), enterococcus faecalis (n = 43), other catalase-negative cocci (n = 20). when needed, species id was determined using molecular methods. test bacterial strains were chosen among those carrying clinically-relevant resistance determinants (penicillin, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, glycopeptides). ast results of the phoenix system were compared to minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values measured by the etest method (ab biodisk, solna, sweden). results: streptococci: essential agreement (ea) and categorical agreement (ca) were 91.9% and 98.8%, respectively. major (me) and minor errors (me) accounted for 0.1% and 1.1% of isolates, respectively. no very major errors (vme) were produced. enterococci: ea was 97%,  ca 96%. small numbers of vme (0.9%), me (1.4%) and me (2.8%) were obtained. overall, ea and ca rates for most drugs were above 90% for both genera. a few vme were found: a) teicoplanin and high-level streptomycin for e. faecalis, b) high-level gentamicin for e. faecium. the mean time to results (+/- sd) was 11.8  +/- 0.9 h, with minor differences between streptococci and enterococci. conclusion: the phoenix system emerged as an effective tool for quantitative ast. panels based on dilution tests provided rapid and accurate mic values with regard to clinically-relevant streptococcal and enterococcal species.

TI  == comparative in vitro antimicrobial activity of tigecycline, a new glycylcycline compound, in freshly prepared medium and quality control.
AB  == the in vitro spectra of activity of tigecycline and tetracycline were determined  for 2,490 bacterial isolates representing 50 different species or phenotypic groups. all isolates were tested simultaneously by broth microdilution using freshly prepared mueller-hinton broth and by disk diffusion. portions of these data were submitted to the food and drug administration (fda) in support of the sponsor's application for new drug approval. in a separate study, mic and disk diffusion quality control ranges were determined. the tigecycline mics at which 50%/90% of bacteria were inhibited were (in microg/ml) as follows: for streptococcus spp., 0.06/0.12; for moraxella catarrhalis, 0.06/0.12; for staphylococcus spp., 0.12/0.25; for enterococcus spp., 0.12/0.25; for listeria monocytogenes, 0.12/0.12; for neisseria meningitidis, 0.12/0.25; for haemophilus  spp., 0.25/0.5; for enterobacteriaceae, 0.05/2.0; for non-enterobacteriaceae, 0.5/8.0. tigecycline was consistently more potent than tetracycline against all species studied. the data from this study confirm the fda-approved mic and disk diffusion breakpoints for tigecycline for streptococcus spp. other than streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococci, and enterobacteriaceae. provisional breakpoints for haemophilus spp. and s. pneumoniae are proposed based on the data from this study. the following mic and/or disk diffusion quality control ranges are proposed: staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213, 0.03 to 0.25 microg/ml; s. aureus atcc 25923, 20 to 25 mm; escherichia coli atcc 25922, 0.03 to 0.25 microg/ml and  20 to 27 mm; pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, 9 to 13 mm, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, 0.03 to 0.12 microg/ml; s. pneumoniae atcc 49619, 0.015 to 0.12 microg/ml and 23 to 29 mm; haemophilus influenzae atcc 49247, 0.06 to 0.5 microg/ml and 23 to 31 mm; and neisseria gonorrhoeae atcc 49226, 30 to 40 mm.

TI  == in-vitro profile of a new beta-lactam, ceftobiprole, with activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == ceftobiprole is a novel, broad-spectrum cephalosporin with in-vitro activity against common gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. it forms a stable inhibitory complex with staphylococcus aureus penicillin-binding protein (pbp) 2' (2a), resulting in enhanced activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). in recent studies of methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, the ceftobiprole  mic(90) value was most frequently < or =1.0 mg/l (mic range < or =0.25-1.0 mg/l). for mrsa, mic(90) values were generally 2.0 mg/l (mic range < or =0.06-4.0 mg/l). mics for all streptococcal species, except penicillin-resistant streptococcus viridans but including penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, ranged from < or =0.008 to 2.0 mg/l. ceftobiprole is active against enterococcus faecalis (mic(90) = 4 mg/l), but not generally active against enterococcus faecium (mic(90) > 16 mg/l). ceftobiprole displayed bactericidal activity against gram-negative pathogens comparable to that of cefepime, ceftazidime or piperacillin-tazobactam in early studies. however, recent data show activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa similar to that of cefepime but less than that of  ceftazidime. ceftobiprole, like cefepime, is stable in the presence of most class a non-extended spectrum beta-lactamases and inducible class c beta-lactamases. ceftobiprole is a poor inducer of ampc beta-lactamase and a poor substrate for hydrolysis by ampc beta-lactamase. studies of ceftobiprole in several animal models have demonstrated potent in-vivo efficacy against infections caused by mrsa, including strains intermediately resistant to vancomycin. it was also efficacious in murine infections caused by gram-negative bacteria with mic values < or =2 mg/l. the broad spectrum of activity demonstrated by ceftobiprole in vitro and in vivo suggests that it may have potential for empirical treatment of  suspected gram-negative and gram-positive infections, including those caused by mrsa.

TI  == new tn916-related elements causing erm(b)-mediated erythromycin resistance in tetracycline-susceptible pneumococci.
AB  == objectives: to analyse the as yet unexplored genetic elements encoding erm(b)-mediated erythromycin resistance in tetracycline-susceptible pneumococci.  methods: sixteen streptococcus pneumoniae clinical isolates sharing erm(b)-mediated erythromycin resistance and susceptibility to tetracycline were used. gene detection was performed by pcr using both established and specially designed primers. s. pneumoniae r6, streptococcus pyogenes 12rf and enterococcus  faecalis jh2-2 were used as recipients in mating experiments. results: of the 16  test strains, 14 bore an unexpressed tet(m) gene which in 13 strains had a genetic linkage with erm(b). three isolates yielded a 3.2 kb and 10 an 11.9 kb erm(b)/tet(m) amplicon. the former three showed genetic organizations similar to  that of the composite element tn3872, where the erm(b)-carrying tn917 transposon  is inserted into a tn916-like element. of the latter 10 isolates, 9 showed genetic organizations substantially overlapping with that of tn6002, a newly sequenced erm(b)-containing tn916-related transposon. the tenth isolate carried a novel composite element (designated tn6003) resulting from the insertion into a tn6002-like transposon of a fragment [designated macrolide-aminoglycoside-streptothricin (mas) element] containing a second erm(b) (lacking the stop codon) and a variant of the aade-sat4-apha-3 cluster. the two tet(m)-negative isolates had different tn3872-related elements, one containing a  complete and one a deleted mas fragment. conjugative transfer was obtained from donors carrying tn6002-related elements, not from donors carrying tn3872-related  elements. conclusions: in tetracycline-susceptible pneumococci with erm(b)-mediated erythromycin resistance, the erm(b) gene is carried on a variety  of tn916-related genetic elements either lacking tet(m) or, more often, carrying  an unexpressed tet(m) gene.

TI  == synthesis and in vitro evaluation of substituted phenyl-piperazinyl-phenyl oxazolidinones against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == with the incidence of linezolid-resistant enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium and staphylococcus aureus, modification of linezolid at the 5- and/or 3-positions led to the development of a series of 3-(methoxyl-phenyl)-piperazinyl-phenyl oxazolidinone analogues. these compounds were tested in vitro against six gram-positive standard organisms (s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. pneumoniae, s. albus, streptococcus enteridis and s. nonhemolyticus). 5-acetylaminomethyl oxazolidinones bearing fluorine at 3'-position of phenyl ring showed activities against several gram-positive bacteria (mic: 3.13-6.25 mug/ml). the position of methoxyl group on the phenyl ring of piperazine group affected antibacterial spectrum. 3-(4'- (para-methoxyl-phenyl)-piperazinyl)-(3'-fluoro)-phenyl-5-acetylaminomethyl oxazolidinone was found active against 5 gram-positive organisms except s. nonhemolyticus, whereas 3-(4'-(ortho-methoxyl-phenyl)-piperazinyl)-(3'-fluoro)-phenyl-5-acetylaminomethyl oxazolidinone was found active only against 2 gram-positive organisms, namely s.  albus, s. enteridis.

TI  == multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16s rrna gene pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  == we have developed a novel high-throughput pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (pcr-ldr-ce) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, francisella tularensis, and brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. the method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16s rrna gene, using universal pcr primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent ldr. the ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by ce. each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to  distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. the assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. the ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the united states. in summary, the pcr-ldr-ce assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of  20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.

TI  == reversal of resistance in microorganisms by help of non-antibiotics.
AB  == intracellular efflux pumps have been largely the research focus in multidrug-resistant (mdr) gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms and parasites including cancers. however, drug efflux mechanisms other than pumps per se have been observed, supported by the effects of isomeric, non-antibiotic depressant (dpr), phenothiazines and thixenes, and antidepressant (adpr) phenylpiperidine neurotropic drugs, alone or in combination with classical antimicrobials on mdr staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. of the non-antibiotics we investigated, the dpr l-thioridazine, trans-clopenthixol and isomers of phenylpiperidines nnc 20-4962 (isomer of femoxetine) and nnc 20-7052 (isomer of paroxetine) were potent antimicrobials with the least neurotropic activity, pointing to a possible general isomeric structure-activity  relationship. these compounds may be regarded as new efflux inhibitors. moreover, these isomers have considerably reduced, in some cases absent, neurotropism and reduced mammalian toxicity. this may alleviate concerns about adverse effects and therapeutic safety for infected patients in life-threatening situations where the non-antibiotic dosage would be in the lower, non-chronic dosage ranges generally  prescribed for individuals with mild mental health problems. the results point to the prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms' phospholipid/protein domain involvement of the cationic, amphiphilic, non-antibiotic dpr and adpr, with the phospholipids being the initial sites attracting and concentrating the neurotropes to induce a form of suspended animation, followed by gross changes of cell wall and membrane structure, and thereby potentiating their destructive or immobilizing effects on various as yet only hinted at resistance and efflux mechanisms. combination of appropriate isomeric non-antibiotic dpr and adpr of low neurotropism and toxicity with conventional and classical antimicrobials promises early, new therapeutic strategies salutary against microbial resistance, resistance development, pathogenicity and virulence.

TI  == s-adenosylmethionine directly inhibits binding of 30s ribosomal subunits to the smk box translational riboswitch rna.
AB  == the s(mk) box is a conserved riboswitch motif found in the 5' untranslated region of metk genes [encoding s-adenosylmethionine (sam) synthetase] in lactic acid bacteria, including enterococcus, streptococcus, and lactococcus sp. previous studies showed that this rna element binds sam in vitro, and sam binding causes a structural rearrangement that sequesters the shine-dalgarno (sd) sequence by pairing with an anti-sd (asd) element. a model was proposed in which sam binding  inhibits metk translation by preventing binding of the ribosome to the sd region  of the mrna. in the current work, the addition of sam was shown to inhibit binding of 30s ribosomal subunits to s(mk) box rna; in contrast, the addition of  s-adenosylhomocysteine (sah) had no effect. a mutant rna, which has a disrupted sd-asd pairing, was defective in sam binding and showed no reduction of ribosome  binding in the presence of sam, whereas a compensatory mutation that restored sd-asd pairing restored the response to sam. primer extension inhibition assays provided further evidence for sd-asd pairing in the presence of sam. these results strongly support the model that s(mk) box translational repression operates through occlusion of the ribosome binding site and that sam binding requires the sd-asd pairing.

TI  == coniothyrione, a chlorocyclopentandienylbenzopyrone as a bacterial protein synthesis inhibitor discovered by antisense technology.

AB  == the enteric flora of captive whooping cranes (grus americana) and sandhill cranes (grus canadensis) has not been well described, despite its potential importance in the understanding of both the normal condition of the intestinal physiology of these animals and the altered colonization within disease states in these birds.  nineteen whooping cranes and 23 sandhill cranes housed currently at the calgary zoo or its affiliated devonian wildlife conservation centre (dwcc) in calgary, alberta were sampled from october 2004-february 2005 by collecting aerobic and anaerobic cloacal swabs from each bird. there were seven major groupings of bacteria isolated from both species of crane. gram-positive cocci, coliforms, and gram-negative bacilli were the most prevalent types of bacteria isolated for both crane species, with escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus group d, not enterococcus the bacterial species isolated most commonly. there was a significant difference in the average number of isolates per individual between the two crane species but no differences between age or gender categories within  crane species. campylobacter sp. were isolated from five whooping cranes. the potential zoonotic pathogen campylobacter jejuni was isolated from one whooping crane and c. upsaliensis was isolated from a second. three other isolates were unspeciated members of the campylobacter genus and likely belong to a species undescribed previously. the evaluation of the enteric cloacal flora of whooping cranes and sandhill cranes illustrates that differences exist between these two closely related crane species, and highlights the potential implications these differences may have for current practices involving captive wildlife. zoo biol 0:1-13, 2007.

TI  == characterization of macrolide resistance in gram-positive cocci from colombian hospitals: a countrywide surveillance.
AB  == objective: the characterization of macrolide resistance in gram-positive cocci recovered from colombian hospitals. methods: the resistance profiles and mechanism of macrolide resistance were investigated in isolates of streptococcus  pneumoniae (1679), staphylococcus aureus (348), coagulase-negative staphylococci  (cons) (175), and enterococcus spp (123). minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) for erythromycin (ery) and clindamycin (cli), detection of macrolide resistance genes, phenotypic characterization, and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge) of macrolide-resistant pneumococci were performed. results: resistance to ery and cli was 3.3% and 2.3% for s. pneumoniae, 58% and 57% for s. aureus (94% for both compounds in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa)), and 78.6% and 60.7% in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, respectively. ery resistance was 62% in enterococcus faecalis and 82% in enterococcus faecium. the mls(b)-type accounted for 71% of s. pneumoniae and 100% of mrsa. the erm(a) gene was prevalent in mrsa, erm(b) in s. pneumoniae  and enterococci, and erm(c) in cons isolates. efflux pump genes (mef(a) genes) were mostly identified in s. pneumoniae (24%). the most common genotype amongst ery-resistant pneumococci was the spain(6b)-2 clone. conclusions: the prevalence  of macrolide resistance is low in colombian pneumococci and high in mrsa (cmls(b)-type).

TI  == contribution of a pleural antigen assay (binax now) to the diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia.
AB  == study objectives: to determine whether the detection of pneumococcal antigen in pleural fluid augments conventional microbiological methods used for the etiologic diagnosis of pneumonia. methods: in this retrospective study, a rapid immunochromatographic test (ict) [now streptococcus pneumoniae assay; binax; scarborough, me] was performed on pleural fluid samples from 34 patients with pneumonia due to s pneumoniae, 89 patients with effusions of nonpneumococcal origin, and 17 patients with pneumonia of unknown etiology. data on blood cultures, pleural fluid cultures, and urinary antigen tests were recorded. results: the ict test result was positive in 24 of 34 patients (70.6%) with pneumococcal pneumonia and negative in 83 of 89 patients (93.3%) without pneumococcal pneumonia. the sensitivity of the pleural ict test was higher than that obtained for blood (37.5%) and pleural fluid cultures (32.3%), but lower than the detection of pneumococcal antigen in urine samples (82.1%). however, three patients with pneumococcal pneumonia and a negative ict urine test result had a positive pleural fluid antigen detection result test. previous antibiotic exposure did not influence pneumococcal antigen detection in either pleural fluid or urine specimens. six additional patients with empyema due to anaerobes (three  patients), streptococcus viridans (two patients), and enterococcus faecalis (one  patient) had false-positive pleural ict test results. finally, the ict assay finding was also positive in 5 of 17 patients (29.4%) with pneumonia without a definite microbiological cause. conclusions: the ict test performed on pleural fluid samples augments the standard diagnostic methods of blood and pleural fluid cultures, even in the case of prior antibiotic therapy, and enhances the ict urinary antigen assay.

AB  == notification of bacterial meningitis (bm) is likely to be incomplete, and a recent danish study indicated that unbalanced notification may bias expected aetiology of bm. therefore the danish bacterial meningitis group initiated a national registration of culture-positive bm. methods: laboratory data on all bacterial isolates from cerebrospinal fluid deemed to be clinically relevant were identified on a national basis during 2002 and 2003. bacterial findings were compared to cases notified during the same period. results: a total of 404 bm cases were identified. the distribution of bacterial species differed from the national notification data during the same period especially with respect to staphylococcus aureus (6.7% vs. 0.6%), escherichia coli (3.5% vs. 0%) and non-streptococcus pneumoniae streptococci (10% vs. 1.9%). the overall notification-rate was 66%, and was below 20% for s. aureus, e. coli, enterococcus faecalis, non-s. pneumoniae streptococci and for 13 cases of "other bacteria". sensitivity to antibiotics in the bm cases was as expected for northern europe. reduced sensitivity to penicillin was found in 2/202 s. pneumoniae, in 2/10 listeria monocytogenes, and 21/27 s. aureus were penicillin resistant. e. coli was resistant to ampicillin in 5 of 13 cases and to gentamicin in 1 of 11 cases.  discussion: a suboptimal notification rate with an unbalanced species distribution was found. laboratory based data thus constitute an improved basis for future recommendations for empirical treatment of bm. a continued national collaboration may promote the development of quality indicators for diagnosis and initial treatment of bm.

AB  == hemodialysis catheter related infections (hcri) are one of the major causes of increasing mortality, morbidity and cost of therapy in hemodialysis patients. prevention of hcri requires the identification of predisposing risk factors. to determine the frequency of hcri risk factors, we studied 116 patients (54% male,  mean age of 49.5+/-16 years) patients with hcri between 2003-2004. forty one percent of the patients were diabetic. there was a history of previous catheter placement and infection in 41% and 32% of patients, respectively. pathogenic organisms isolated from blood cultures included staphylococcus-aureus 42%, coagulase-negative staphylococci 20%, e. coli 19%, enterococci 7%, streptococcus  d 7%, pseudomonas aeruginosa 4%, and klebsiella 1%. bacterial resistance to vancomycin and amikacin was present in 7% and 4% of the cases, respectively. hemodialysis catheter related blood borne infections comprised 67% of the total blood-borne infections in our hospital. no significant statistical association was found between hcri and age, gender, diabetes mellitus, serum albumin level <30 g/l, leukocyte count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, anatomical location of  catheter, mean duration of antibiotic therapy, mean catheter duration, frequency  of hemodialysis sessions, pathogenic organisms, and history of previous catheter  infection. we conclude that the prevalence of pathogenic organisms of hcri were similar to previous studies. however, bacterial resistance to antibiotics was low. the mean duration of catheter usage was longer than previously reported.

AB  == the activities of the crude ethanol extract from piper cubeba seeds, (-)-cubebin  and its semi-synthetic derivatives were evaluated against oral pathogens. the crude ethanol extract was more active against streptococcus salivarius (mic value of 80 microg/ml). (-)-cubebin displayed mic values ranging from 0.20 mm for streptococcus mitis to 0.35 mm for enterococcus faecalis. the natural product (-)-cubebin and its semi-synthetic derivative (-)-hinokinin displayed bacteriostatic activity at all evaluated concentrations, as well as fungicidal activity against candida albicans at 0.28 mm. the o-benzyl cubebin derivative showed fungistatic and fungicidal effects against c. albicans at 0.28 mm and 0.35 mm, respectively. also, the other dibenzylbutyrolactone derivatives [(-)-6,6'-dinitrohinokinin and (-)-o-(n,n-dimethylaminoethyl)-cubebin] displayed  bacteriostatic and fungistatic effects at the evaluated concentrations. moreover, the semi-synthetic derivative (-)-6,6'-dinitrohinokinin was the most active compound against all the evaluated microorganisms. therefore, it may be suggested that the presence of the carbonyl group at c-9 plus the introduction of polar groups in the aromatic rings improve the antimicrobial activity of dibenzylbutyrolactone compounds.

TI  == sensitivity of oral bacteria to 254 nm ultraviolet light.
AB  == aim: to explore the sensitivity of bacteria commonly found in root canals to 254  nm ultraviolet (uv) light, either as individual cells or as participants of a bacterial multilayer. methodology: the sensitivity of oral bacteria, as individual cells, to uv light was tested by subjecting plates streaked with bacteria to 254 nm uv, at a fluence of 1-20 mj cm(-2). an experimental model was  designed to produce a bacterial multilayer and to study absorption of uv light by bacteria in an outer layer and its effect on the elimination of bacteria in the inner layer. results: direct exposure to relatively low doses of uv light (2-7 mj cm(-2)) effectively eliminated all bacterial strains tested. furthermore, an enterococcus faecalis strain, partially resistant to a 24 h exposure to calcium hydroxide, was effectively eliminated within several seconds of exposure to uv light (p < 0.001). uv was absorbed by a multilayer of bacteria. when 4 bacterial  cells microm(-2) were present in the light path, the uv light dose had to be increased by a factor of x10 to achieve 100% elimination of the bacteria in an inner layer. conclusions: the application of uv light to eliminate endodontic pathogens may be possible. nevertheless, its absorbance by outer layers of bacteria should be considered and the uv light dose adapted accordingly.

TI  == [distribution of bacteria isolated from urine cultures in malatya university hospital laboratory (letter)].
AB  == the aim of this letter was to report the distribution of bacterial species isolated from the urine samples of patients in malatya, which is located in estern anatolia part of turkey. a total of 3.774 urine cultures were performed in the period of april-june 2006, and 792 (21%) of them yielded bacterial growth. the isolates have been identified by conventional methods and confirmed by phoenix 100 (becton-dickinson) system. as a result, 702 (89%) gram negative and 90 (11%) gram positive bacteria were isolated from the samples. the most frequently isolated bacteria were escherichia coli (58%), followed by klebsiella  spp. (14%), pseudomonas spp. (6.4%), enterococcus spp. (5%), staphylococcus spp.  (3.8%) and streptococcus spp. (1.7%). the species distribution was found as follows; k. pneumoniae ssp pneumoniae (95/110), p. aeruginosa (48/51), e.faecalis (27/40), e. cloacae (19/29), p.mirabilis (19/22), c.freundii (8/12), coagulase negative staphylococci (19/30) and s. aureus (11/30). the first three array were  shared by e. coli, klebsiella spp. and pseudomonas spp. for the samples of both outpatients and inpatients, while pseudomonas spp. and e. coli were the most frequently isolated bacteria from the urine samples of intensive care unit patients. our data was found parallel to the results of other national and international studies.

TI  == a review of the current place of glycopeptides in turkish medical practice.
AB  == background: glycopeptide antibiotics are considered by many investigators to be the last resort in the treatment of gram-positive bacterial infections. objective: the aim of this review was to assess the place of glycopeptides in the treatment of common gram-positive bacteria in accordance with the current epidemiologic data in turkey. methods: a search of both the english- and turkish-language literature indexed on medline, ulakbim (turkey), and pleksus (turkey) was performed using the terms: vancomycin, teicoplanin, and glycopeptides, or their turkish-language counterparts. the complete texts of the  articles found in these databases were obtained from the electronic library of gulhane medical academy, ankara, turkey. articles from regional journals, without the support of an electronic format, were obtained by direct communication. articles of interest were those based on studies occurring in turkish populations, with special consideration given to publications in press after 2002. results: staphylococci were the most frequent gram-positive pathogens encountered in turkish hospitals. studies have found that approximately 74% of strains were staphylococcus aureus and the remaining strains were coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons). overall methicillin resistance in staphylococci was reported as approximately 60%. in turkey, s aureus was one of the most common infectious agents found inside hospitals and is deemed a growing  threat in the community. while the rate of methicillin resistance in community-acquired isolates is approximately 4%, the data from hospitals suggest  that reduced resistance comprises most of the isolates. in the studies reviewed,  older quinolones like ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin seem to be ineffective in nearly half of the s aureus isolates. alternatives like rifampicin, gentamicin, tetracycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (tmp/smx), clindamycin, and erythromycin have had substantial resistance profiles in >50% of the strains. in  recent turkish studies, in vitro profiles of linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin (qd), and daptomycin have had positive results. as in the s aureus isolates, resistance trends have been observed in the cons group of pathogens. the possible use of beta-lactams seems restricted, and alternative approaches have become necessary. quinolones, gentamicin, tetracycline, tmp/smx, clindamycin, and erythromycin have resistance profiles of >50%. although glycopeptide resistance was not detected, the frequency of heterogenous vancomycin-intermediate s aureus, a precursor to future resistance, was 13% in 1 study. current studies in turkey have found that enterococcus faecalis comprises three quarters of enterococci while the rest are comprised of enterococcus faecium. initial studies performed with linezolid, qd, and daptomycin suggest that these drugs might be effective alternatives for future enterococcal infections that may have high glycopeptide resistance. approximately 8% of the streptococcus pneumoniae strains had high-level resistance in turkey. however, 10 million units of crystallized penicillin or 3 g of oral amoxicillin maintains the optimum treatment of pneumococcal infections outside the central nervous system (cns). resistance profiles in third-generation cephalosporins in turkey range between 2% and 2.5%.  conclusions: in turkey, a review of the existing literature found that the current use of glycopeptides in pneumococcal infections is restricted to cns infections facing therapeutic failure in due course. however, the belief that these drugs are the last resort, either in staphylococcal or enterococcal infections, is no longer valid. if a patient has a critical status due to probable gram-positive microorganisms, clinicians should consider the empiric use of glycopeptides. however, new molecules such as linezolid, qd, and daptomycin, offered for use in the treatment of gram-positive bacterial diseases, should be reserved for the future, when glycopeptides eventually become obsolete.

TI  == exploring the antibacterial and hemolytic activity of shorter- and longer-chain beta-, alpha,beta-, and gamma-peptides, and of beta-peptides from beta2-3-aza- and beta3-2-methylidene-amino acids bearing proteinogenic side chains--a survey.
AB  == the antibacterial activities of 31 different beta-, mixed alpha/beta-, and gamma-peptides, as well as of beta-peptides derived from beta2-3-aza- and beta3-2-methylidene-amino acids were assayed against six pathogens (enterococcus  faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa), and the results were compared with literature data. the interaction of these peptides with mammalian cells, as  modeled by measuring the hemolysis of human erythrocytes, was also investigated.  in addition to those peptides designed to fold into amphiphilic helical conformations with positive charges on one face of the helix, one new peptide with hemolytic activity was detected within the sample set. moreover, it was demonstrated that neither cationic peptides used for membrane translocation (beta3-oligoarginines), nor mixed alpha/beta- or gamma-peptides with somatostatin-mimicking activities display unwanted hemolytic activity.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigecycline against quinolone-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant  enterococci.
AB  == tigecycline is a glycylcycline with promising broad-spectrum activity, including  resistant gram-positive organisms. this study characterizes in vitro activity of  tigecycline against quinolone-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (qrsp), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vre). an in vitro pharmacodynamic model generated specific bacterial kill profiles for tigecycline against clinical isolates of qrsp, mrsa and vre. tigecycline produced a 6.6 log total reduction and cleared qrsp from the pharmacodynamic model by 18 h. tigecycline and vancomycin were unable to achieve  3-log reductions in the mrsa and vre isolates; log reductions in mrsa and vre were 1.5 and 1.2 logs for tigecycline and 2.8 and zero for vancomycin, respectively. area under the concentration time curve to minimum inhibitory concentration (auc/mic) values for tigecycline ranged from 79 to 158 microg h/ml  and tigecycline concentrations remained above the mic (t>mic) throughout the simulated dosing interval. tigecycline showed in vitro activity against the qrsp, mrsa and vre isolates studied. low mic values, prolonged elimination half-life and the associated post-antibiotic effect (pae) observed with tigecycline are desirable attributes that make it a potentially attractive option for treating resistant gram-positive organisms.

TI  == comparison of bactec plus blood culture media to bact/alert fa blood culture media for detection of bacterial pathogens in samples containing therapeutic levels of antibiotics.
AB  == blood culture bottles with antimicrobial removal systems are recommended for patients who develop fever while on antibiotics. this study compared the ability  of becton dickinson (sparks, md) bactec plus bottles and biomerieux (durham, nc)  bact/alert fa bottles to effectively remove vancomycin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, ampicillin, oxacillin, gentamicin, and a combination of gentamicin/penicillin, thus allowing bacterial pathogens to grow.  each bottle was spiked with 10 ml of human blood, antibiotic, and strains of organisms susceptible to the antibiotic evaluated. the organisms used were type strains and clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (methicillin susceptible and resistant), streptococcus pneumoniae, a viridans streptococcus, enterococcus  faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. testing was completed in triplicate, using 10 to 100 cfu/ml of organisms with various concentrations of each antibiotic. two rounds of testing were completed per antibiotic/organism combination. bottles were mixed and loaded onto their respective instruments as per the manufacturer's instructions. antimicrobial removal was evaluated on the basis of time to detection of organism growth, for up to 5 days of incubation. overall, the bact/alert fa system recovered 25.1% of strains from test bottles and 96.9% of strains from growth control bottles (no antibiotic added), and the bactec plus system recovered 95.1% of strains from test bottles and 100% of strains from growth control bottles. both systems performed well in the detection of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in the presence of gentamicin. in the presence of ceftriaxone, neither system was able to recover streptococcus pneumoniae. the ability to remove vancomycin and cefoxitin was also determined by measuring antibiotic levels remaining in bottles after 1 h of incubation. the results demonstrated remaining levels of 72 to 90% of vancomycin and 71 to 72% of cefoxitin in the bact/alert system. for the bactec system, remaining levels were 0 to 30% of vancomycin and 0% of cefoxitin. under these simulated conditions, the bactec plus system was superior to the bact/alert fa system in recovering gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens in the presence of beta-lactam antibiotics, gentamicin/penicillin, and vancomycin.

TI  == dual targeting of gyrb and pare by a novel aminobenzimidazole class of antibacterial compounds.
AB  == a structure-guided drug design approach was used to optimize a novel series of aminobenzimidazoles that inhibit the essential atpase activities of bacterial dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv and that show potent activities against a variety of  bacterial pathogens. two such compounds, vrt-125853 and vrt-752586, were characterized for their target specificities and preferences in bacteria. in metabolite incorporation assays, vrt-125853 inhibited both dna and rna synthesis  but had little effect on protein synthesis. both compounds inhibited the maintenance of negative supercoils in plasmid dna in escherichia coli at the mic. sequencing of dna corresponding to the gyrb and pare atp-binding regions in vrt-125853- and vrt-752586-resistant mutants revealed that their primary target in staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae was gyrb, whereas in streptococcus pneumoniae it was pare. in enterococcus faecalis, the primary target of vrt-125853 was pare, whereas for vrt-752586 it was gyrb. dna transformation experiments with h. influenzae and s. aureus proved that the mutations observed in gyrb resulted in decreased susceptibilities to both compounds. novobiocin resistance-conferring mutations in s. aureus, h. influenzae, and s. pneumoniae were found in gyrb, and these mutants showed little or no cross-resistance to vrt-125853 or vrt-752586 and vice versa. furthermore, gyrb and pare double mutations increased the mics of vrt-125853 and vrt-752586 significantly, providing evidence of dual targeting. spontaneous frequencies of resistance to vrt-752586 were below detectable levels (<5.2x10(-10)) for wild-type e. faecalis but were significantly elevated for strains containing single and double target-based mutations, demonstrating that dual targeting confers low levels of resistance emergence and the maintenance of susceptibility  in vitro.

TI  == monotherapy versus combination therapy.
AB  == the science of antibiotic therapy for infectious diseases continues to evolve. in many instances where empiric coverage is necessary, treatment with more than one  agent is considered prudent. if an etiology is identified, antibiotics are modified based on culture and susceptibility data. even when the organism is known, more than one antibiotic may be needed. decisions about antibiotics should be made after assessments of pertinent clinical information, laboratory and microbiology information, ease of administration, patient compliance, potential adverse effects, cost, and available evidence supporting various treatment options. clinicians also need to consider synergy and local resistance patterns in selecting therapeutic options. in this article, the authors outline monotherapy and combination therapy options for several common infectious diseases.

TI  == topical ethyl chloride fine spray. does it have any antimicrobial activity?
AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to assess whether ethyl chloride fine spray (cryogesic) has antimicrobial activity. material and methods: blood agar plates supplemented with 5% horse blood were inoculated with five different organisms, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis. the plates were assessed for growth inhibition at 24 and 48 h by the microbiologist and compared with the non-sprayed control plates. results: the model showed a highly significant (p<0.0001) reduction in bacterial  count for the plates treated with fine ethyl chloride spray. the estimate of the  percentage of bacteria remaining after spraying with ethyl chloride was 42.7%, with a 95% confidence interval of 35.9-50.9%. there was no evidence that the effect of ethyl chloride fine spray was different for the different organisms (p=0.49). conclusion: the use of ethyl chloride shows bacterial count reduction but the clinical implication of this needs to be determined. the authors postulate that any statistically significant reduction can only be helpful in reducing the infection rates. this coupled with the already proven local anaesthetic effects of ethyl chloride will make it an important tool for procedures like arthrocentesis and venepunctures.

TI  == bactericidal activity of ertapenem against major intra-abdominal pathogens.
AB  == treatment of intra-abdominal infections remains a challenge owing to their polymicrobial nature and associated mortality risk. treatment regimens must provide broad-spectrum coverage, including gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria of gastrointestinal origin. ertapenem is a long-acting 1-beta-methyl parenteral group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-daily dosing supported by clinical studies. it is active against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacteriaceae, streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. the aim of this study was to measure the killing effects of ertapenem against a selected group of strains responsible for intra-abdominal infections. gram-negative isolates comprised the following species: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella ozaenae, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers  and non-producers). gram-positive isolates comprised methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), enterococcus faecalis and anaerobic bacteroides fragilis. ertapenem activity was tested by determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs). killing curves were performed in monocultures and co-cultures at selected antibiotic concentrations. ertapenem showed a rapid and potent bactericidal activity in the  first few hours of the kinetic curves against e. coli (6 log(10) colony-forming unit (cfu) reduction in the first 2h), b. fragilis (4 log(10) cfu reduction in 4h), mssa (3 log(10) cfu reduction in 4-6h), k. ozaenae (esbl+), k. pneumoniae (esbl+ and -), e. cloacae (esbl-) in 1h and p. mirabilis (esbl+) in the first 2h. the potent bactericidal activity of ertapenem compared with ceftriaxone and piperacillin/tazobactam was well demonstrated in the co-cultures of e. coli-b. fragilis and e. coli-b. fragilis-e. faecalis, whilst ertapenem was shown to be bactericidal at 24h in the mixed culture of s. aureus-p. mirabilis. these results support the potent in vitro bactericidal activity of ertapenem against all multiresistant strains selected in this study and the use of this drug in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.

TI  == functional characterization and me ion specificity of a ca-citrate transporter from enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == secondary transporters of the bacterial citmhs family transport citrate in complex with a metal ion. different members of the family are specific for the metal ion in the complex and have been shown to transport mg(2+)-citrate, ca(2+)-citrate or fe(3+)-citrate. the fe(3+)-citrate transporter of streptococcus mutans clusters on the phylogenetic tree on a separate branch with a group of transporters found in the phylum firmicutes which are believed to be involved in  anaerobic citrate degradation. we have cloned and characterized the transporter from enterococcus faecalis efcith in this cluster. the gene was functionally expressed in escherichia coli and studied using right-side-out membrane vesicles. the transporter catalyzes proton-motive-force-driven uptake of the ca(2+)-citrate complex with an affinity constant of 3.5 microm. homologous exchange is catalyzed with a higher efficiency than efflux down a concentration gradient. analysis of the metal ion specificity of efcith activity in right-side-out membrane vesicles  revealed a specificity that was highly similar to that of the bacillus subtilis ca(2+)-citrate transporter in the same family. in spite of the high sequence identity with the s. mutans fe(3+)-citrate transporter, no transport activity with fe(3+) (or fe(2+)) could be detected. the transporter of e. faecalis catalyzes translocation of citrate in complex with ca(2+), sr(2+), mn(2+), cd(2+) and pb(2+) and not with mg(2+), zn(2+), ni(2+) and co(2+). the specificity appears to correlate with the size of the metal ion in the complex.

AB  == to understand better the mechanisms of fluoroquinolone resistance in enterococcus faecalis, fluoroquinolone-resistant mutants isolated from ent. faecalis atcc 29212 by stepwise selection with sparfloxacin (spx) and norfloxacin (nor) were analysed. the results showed the following. (i) in general, fluoroquinolone-resistance mechanisms in ent. faecalis are similar to those in other gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae, namely, mutants with amino acid changes in both gyra and parc exhibited high fluoroquinolone resistance, and single gyra mutants and a single parc mutant were more resistant to spx and nor, respectively, than the parent strain, indicating that the primary targets of spx and nor in ent. faecalis are dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv, respectively. (ii) alterations in gyrb (deltakga, residues 395-397) and pare (glu-459 to lys) were associated with fluoroquinolone resistance in some mutants. moreover, the facts that the nor mic, but not the spx mic, decreased in the presence of multidrug efflux pump inhibitors, that nor accumulation decreased in the cells, and that the emea mrna  expression level did not change, strongly suggested that a nora-like efflux pump, rather than emea, was involved in resistance to nor.

AB  == a series of pyrazolidine-3,5-dione and 5-hydroxy-1h-pyrazol-3(2h)-one inhibitors  of escherichia coli udp-n-acetylenolpyruvyl glucosamine reductase (murb) has been prepared. the 5-hydroxy-1h-pyrazol-3(2h)-ones show low micromolar ic(50) values versus e. coli murb and submicromolar minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) against staphylococcus aureus gc 1131, enterococcus faecalis gc 2242, streptococcus pneumoniae gc 1894, and e. coli gc 4560 imp, a strain with increased outer membrane permeability. none of these compounds show antimicrobial activity against candida albicans, a marker of eukaryotic toxicity. moreover, these compounds inhibit peptidoglycan biosynthesis, as assessed by measuring the  amount of soluble peptidoglycan produced by streptococcus epidermidis upon incubation with compounds. a partial least squares projection to latent structures analysis shows that improving murb potency and mic values correlate with increasing lipophilicity of the c-4 substituent of the 5-hydroxy-1h-pyrazol-3(2h)-one core. docking studies using flo and pharmdock produced several binding orientations for these molecules in the murb active site.

TI  == evaluation of the hygienic quality and associated public health hazards of raw milk marketed by smallholder dairy producers in the dar es salaam region, tanzania.
AB  == a cross-sectional study was conducted to determine three parameters of the quality of the raw milk marketed by milk selling points (msps) in dar es salaam region. total bacterial count (tbc) was used as an indicator of the microbial quality of the milk; antimicrobial residues were determined; and the california mastitis test (cmt) was used to screen for milk somatic cells as an indication of the mastitis level in the cows that provided the milk. moreover, a water sample at each msp was taken for bacteriological culturing. finally, a questionnaire survey was conducted with the milk sellers at the msps to identify risk factors for poor milk hygiene. a total of 128 milk samples and corresponding water samples were collected from randomly selected milk selling points in dar es salaam region. the mean tbc was (8.2 +/- 1.9) x 10(6) cfu/ml, and major bacterial isolates from the milk samples were escherichia coli (6.3%), bacillus cereus (6.3%), staphylococcus aureus (6.3%) and streptococcus agalactiae (6.3%), enterobacter aerogenes (5.6%) and enterococcus faecalis (4.7%). in most cases, the organisms identified in milk corresponded to those isolated from the corresponding water samples. of milk samples, 79.0% were positive to the cmt and  7.0% were positive for antimicrobial residues. tbc was normalized by log-transformation, and the possible predictors of tbc were identified by fitting two linear regression models. in a random effect model, water microbial quality,  frequency of cleaning the milk containers, frequency of milk supply, milk storage time and the type of containers, and mixing of fresh and previous milk were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with the mean log tbc. in a fixed effect model, in addition to these indicators, water shortage, water source and the refrigerator condition were significantly (p < or = 0.01) associated with log tbc. it was concluded that the milk sold in dar es salaam region is of poor quality and is of public health significance.

TI  == coaggregation interactions between oral and endodontic enterococcus faecalis and  bacterial species isolated from persistent apical periodontitis.
AB  == interactions between enterococcus faecalis and other species found in root canal  infections might be important for the development and persistence of periapical disease. the aim of this study was to investigate the coaggregation interactions  between e. faecalis clinical isolates and species previously shown to survive and induce apical periodontitis in monkeys: peptostreptococcus anaerobius, prevotella oralis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and streptococcus anginosus. intergeneric coaggregation assays were conducted in duplicate with observations scored immediately at 0 h, 1 h and 24 h after mixing of combinations of strains. all e.  faecalis strains (n = 53) coaggregated with f. nucleatum; e. faecalis did not coaggregate with p. anaerobius or s. anginosus. one strain, e. faecalis e1, coaggregated with p. oralis, with aggregates visible at 1 h. coaggregation interactions between e. faecalis and f. nucleatum observed in this study suggest  a potential role for this combination in endodontic infections.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in the southeastern mediterranean--preliminary results from the armed project.
AB  == sporadic reports from centres in the south and east of the mediterranean have suggested that the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in this region appears to  be considerable, yet pan-regional studies using comparable methodology have been  lacking in the past. susceptibility test results from invasive isolates of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecium and faecalis routinely recovered from clinical samples of blood and cerebrospinal fluid within participating laboratories situated in algeria, cyprus, egypt, jordan, lebanon, malta, morocco, tunisia and turkey were collected as part of the armed project. preliminary data from the first two years of the project showed the prevalence of penicillin non-susceptibility in s. pneumoniae to range from 0% (malta) to 36% (algeria) [median: 29%] whilst methicillin resistance in staphylococcus aureus varied from 10% in lebanon to 65% in jordan [median: 43%]. significant country specific resistance in e. coli was also seen,  with 72% of isolates from egyptian hospitals reported to be resistant to third generation cephalosporins and 40% non-susceptible to fluoroquinolones in turkey.  vancomycin non-susceptibility was only reported in 0.9% of e. faecalis isolates from turkey and in 3.8% of e. faecium isolates from cyprus. the preliminary results from the armed project appear to support previous sporadic reports suggesting high antibiotic resistance in the mediterranean region. they suggest that this is particularly the case in the eastern mediterranean region where resistance in s. aureus and e. coli seems to be higher than that reported in the  other countries of the mediterranean.

TI  == c-terminal wxl domain mediates cell wall binding in enterococcus faecalis and other gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == analysis of the genome sequence of enterococcus faecalis clinical isolate v583 revealed novel genes encoding surface proteins. twenty-seven of these proteins, annotated as having unknown functions, possess a putative n-terminal signal peptide and a conserved c-terminal region characterized by a novel conserved domain designated wxl. proteins having similar characteristics were also detected in other low-g+c-content gram-positive bacteria. we hypothesized that the wxl region might be a determinant of bacterial cell location. this hypothesis was tested by generating protein fusions between the c-terminal regions of two wxl proteins in e. faecalis and a nuclease reporter protein. we demonstrated that the c-terminal regions of both proteins conferred a cell surface localization to the  reporter fusions in e. faecalis. this localization was eliminated by introducing  specific deletions into the domains. interestingly, exogenously added protein fusions displayed binding to whole cells of various gram-positive bacteria. we also showed that the peptidoglycan was a binding ligand for wxl domain attachment to the cell surface and that neither proteins nor carbohydrates were necessary for binding. based on our findings, we propose that the wxl region is a novel cell wall binding domain in e. faecalis and other gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == two-component signal transduction systems as key players in stress responses of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) continue as an important group of gram-positive bacteria that have been extensively exploited in food industries and various biotechnological applications. some lab species are, however, opportunistic pathogens and were reported to be associated with overwhelming number of human infections. during the use of lab in industry or over the course of human infection, these bacteria are exposed to environmental stress. while lab display  adaptive mechanisms to cope with adverse conditions, the regulation of these mechanisms remains to be elucidated. recent completion of genome sequencing of various lab strains combined with the development of advanced molecular techniques have enabled the identification of a number of putative two-component  signal transduction systems, also known as two-component regulatory systems (2crs), in lab. examining the effect of deleting genes specifying putative 2crs proteins in these organisms has revealed the involvement of 2crs in the responses of lab to different stresses. there are lines of evidence indicating that certain 2crs may mediate a general stress response in enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes. this review highlights the influence of 2crs on the physiology of lab during optimal growth and survival/growth on exposure to environmental stress.

TI  == conventional identification of streptococcus uberis isolated from bovine mastitis in argentinean dairy herds.
AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate a conventional scheme for identifying streptococcus uberis strains isolated from bovine mastitis. seventy-five gram-positive, catalase-negative cocci were collected from cows with mastitis from 19 dairy herds located in the east-central region of argentina. five american type culture collection strains and bovine isolates were identified by the api 20 strep system and by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis  of 16s rdna. a conventional scheme based on 11 biochemical tests was selected for identification of strep. uberis strains: the christie-atkins-munch-petersen reaction; hydrolysis of arg, esculin, and sodium hippurate; growth in inulin, mannitol, raffinose, salicin, and sorbitol; and growth at 45 degrees c and in 6.5% nacl. reference strains and 25 bovine isolates were classified accurately to the species level by the conventional scheme in a blind assay. each reference strain and each bovine isolate were identified as belonging to the same species following these 3 methods. the remaining 50 isolates identified as strep. uberis  by the api 20 strep system and 16s rdna rflp were assayed by the conventional scheme. this scheme correctly identified 47 (94%) of 50 isolates as strep. uberis by comparing their biochemical profile with that of the reference strain. three (6%) of the 50 isolates were classified as strep. uberis by the api 20 strep system and by 16s rdna rflp and were identified as enterococcus faecalis by the conventional scheme. thirty percent of the strep. uberis strains showed biochemical profiles identical to the strep. uberis american type culture collection 27958 strain. seventy percent of the strep. uberis strains demonstrated variability compared with the reference strain, resulting in 19 different biochemical profiles. the conventional scheme proposed in this study resulted in a relatively low number of misidentifications and could biochemically identify not only typical, but also atypical strep. uberis strains. this conventional scheme can be considered an adequate method for identifying strep. uberis strains isolated from bovine mastitis because of its affordable cost in developing countries, and it may contribute to determining the frequency of isolation of strep. uberis strains in argentinean dairy herds.

TI  == use of the phoenix automated system for identification of streptococcus and enterococcus spp.
AB  == the phoenix system (becton dickinson diagnostic systems, sparks, md) was evaluated for identification (id) to the species level of streptococci and enterococci. two hundred clinical isolates were investigated: beta-hemolytic streptococci (n = 50), streptococcus pneumoniae organisms (n = 46), viridans group streptococci (n = 31), enterococcus faecium (n = 36), enterococcus faecalis (n = 25), and other catalase-negative cocci (n = 12). the api system (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france) was used as a comparator. molecular methods (sequencing of 16s rrna and zwf and gki genes and ddl gene amplification) were used to investigate discordant results. upon resolution of discrepancies, correct species id was achieved by the phoenix system for 121/129 (93.8%) streptococci and 63/70  (90.0%) enterococci. excellent results were obtained for s. pneumoniae (45/45) and beta-hemolytic streptococci (49/50). with regard to viridans streptococci, the accuracy of the phoenix system was 83.9%. among the latter organisms, the best performance was obtained with isolates of the streptococcus sanguinis group  and streptococcus anginosus group; problems were instead encountered with the streptococcus mitis group. four e. faecium and three e. faecalis isolates were misidentified as enterococcus casseliflavus/enterococcus gallinarum or enterococcus durans. thus, these isolates were identified only at the genus level. compared with commercially available systems, the phoenix system appears a reliable diagnostic tool for identifying clinically relevant streptococci and enterococci. the smic/id-2 panel proved particularly effective for beta-hemolytic streptococci and pneumococci.

TI  == gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase-glutathione synthetase: domain structure and identification of residues important in substrate and glutathione binding.
AB  == in most organisms, glutathione (gsh) is synthesized by the sequential action of distinct enzymes, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-gcs) and gsh synthetase (gs). in streptococcus agalactiae, gsh synthesis is catalyzed by a single enzyme, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase-glutathione synthetase (gamma-gcs-gs). the n-terminal sequence of gamma-gcs-gs is similar to escherichia coli gamma-gcs, but the c-terminal sequence is an atp-grasp domain more similar to d-ala, d-ala ligase than to any known gs. in the present studies, c-terminally and n-terminally truncated constructs were characterized in order to define the limits of the gamma-gcs and gs domains, respectively. although wt gamma-gcs-gs is nearly uninhibited by gsh (k(i) approximately 140 mm), shorter gamma-gcs domain constructs were unexpectedly found to be strongly inhibited (k(i) approximately 15 mm), reproducing a physiologically important regulation seen in monofunctional gamma-gcs enzymes. because studies with e. coli gamma-gcs implicate a flexible loop region in gsh binding, chimeras of s. agalactiae gamma-gcs-gs were made containing gamma-gcs domain flexible loop sequences from enterococcus faecalis and pasteurella multocida gamma-gcs-gs, isoforms that are inhibited by gsh. inhibition remained s. agalactiae-like (i.e., very weak). c-terminal constructs of gamma-gcs-gs have gs activity (0.01-0.04% of wt), but proper folding and significant gs activity required a covalently linked gamma-gcs domain. in addition, site-directed mutants in the middle region of the gamma-gcs-gs sequence established that gs activity depends on residues in a region that is also part of the gamma-gcs domain. our results provide new insights into the structure of gamma-gcs-gs and suggest gamma-gcs-gs evolved from a monomeric gamma-gcs that became c-terminally fused to a multimeric atp-grasp protein.

TI  == 1h nmr spectroscopy in the diagnosis of klebsiella pneumoniae-induced urinary tract infection.
AB  == the (1)h nmr spectroscopic method is suggested and its utility is demonstrated for the diagnosis of klebsiella pneumoniae (k. pneumoniae) in urinary tract infection (uti). k. pneumoniae have the specific property of metabolizing glycerol to 1,3-propanediol (1,3-pd), acetate, ethanol and succinate. the quantity of 1,3-pd produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. other common bacteria causing uti (except for citrobacter frundii), such as escherichia coli (e. coli), pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa), enterobacter  aerogenes, acinetobacter baumanii, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus gp b and staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize glycerol under similar conditions. citrobacter frundii (c. frundii) also gives the same nmr results but is easily differentiated as being motile on direct microscopic examination of urine and it is not common nosocomial infectious agent in urinary  tract infection. the method provides a single-step documentation of k. pneumoniae (and c. frundii) qualitatively as well as quantitatively. out of the total 614 subjects considered, clinical diagnosis of uti was obtained in 516 cases (84%). the nmr-based screening had a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 100% and a false negativity of 10% relative to the conventional quantitative culture method. in the present authors' experience, the results of nmr spectroscopy based screening show a very good correlation with the diagnosis of urinary tract infected patients.

TI  == purification and functional studies of a potent modified quorum-sensing peptide and a two-peptide bacteriocin in streptococcus mutans.
AB  == bacteria use quorum-sensing signals or autoinducers to communicate. the signals in gram-positive bacteria are often peptides activated by proteolytic removal of  an n-terminal leader sequence. while investigating stimulation of antimicrobial peptide production by the streptococcus mutans synthetic competence stimulating peptide signal (21-csp), we found a peptide similar to the 21-csp, but lacking the three c-terminal amino acid residues (18-csp). the 18-csp was more potent in  inducing competence, biofilm formation, and antimicrobial activity than the 21-csp. our results indicate that cleavage of the three c-terminal residues occurred post export, and was not regulated by the csp-signalling system. deletion of comd encoding the csp receptor abolished the competence and biofilm responses to the 21-csp and the 18-csp, suggesting that signal transduction via the comd receptor is involved in the responses to both csps. in s. mutans gs5, beside the 18-csp we also purified to homogeneity a two-peptide bacteriocin which production was stimulated by the 18-csp and the 21-csp. partial sequence of the two-peptide bacteriocin revealed the product of the smbab genes recently described. we found that the peptide smbb was slightly different from the deduced sequence, and confirmed the prediction that both peptides constituting smbab bacteriocin are post-translationally modified. smbab exhibited antimicrobial activity against 11 species of streptococci, enterococcus faecalis and staphylocococcus epidermidis. taken together, the findings support the involvement of the csp response in bacteriocin production by streptococci and suggest a novel strategy to potentiate autoinducer activity.

TI  == resistance to acidic and alkaline environments in the endodontic pathogen enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == background/aims: this study aimed to investigate the biochemical mechanisms employed by the endodontic pathogen enterococcus faecalis to confer acid- and alkali-resistance and to compare these with the mechanisms of representative oral streptococci. methods: e. faecalis jcm8728, streptococcus mutans nctc10449 and streptococcus sanguinis atcc10556 were used to assess both acid- and alkali-resistance by examining: (i) growth in complex media; (ii) stability of intracellular ph (ph(in)); (iii) cell durability to leakage of preloaded bcecf (2',7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxy-fluorescein); and (iv) cell permeability  to sytox-green. results: growth was initiated by e. faecalis at ph 4.0-11.0, by s. mutans at ph 4.0-9.0 and by s. sanguinis at ph 5.0-9.0. the ph(in) was similar to the extracellular ph in s. mutans and s. sanguinis at ph 5-10, while the ph(in) of e. faecalis was maintained at approximately 7.5-8.5 when extracellular  ph was 7.5-10 and was maintained at levels equivalent to the extracellular ph when ph < 7.5. cell membranes of e. faecalis were resistant to bcecf leakage when extracellular ph was 2.5-12 and to sytox-green permeability at ph 4-10. the cell  membrane durability to extracellular ph in e. faecalis was higher than that observed in the streptococcus strains. conclusion: compared to s. mutans, e. faecalis was found to be equally resistant to acid and more resistant to alkalis. the results suggest that ph-resistance in e. faecalis is attributed to membrane durability against acid and alkali, in addition to cell membrane-bound proton-transport systems. these characteristics may account for why e. faecalis is frequently isolated from acidic caries lesions and from persistently infected  root canals where calcium hydroxide medication is ineffective.

TI  == influence of residual bacteria on periapical tissue healing after chemomechanical treatment and root filling of experimentally infected monkey teeth.
AB  == the purpose of this study was twofold: first, to determine the influence on the healing of the periapical tissues when selected bacterial strains and combinations thereof remain after root canal treatment; and, second, the relationship to healing of the quality of the root filling. in eight monkeys, 175 root canals, previously infected with combinations of four or five bacterial strains and with radiographically verified apical periodontitis, were endodontically treated, bacteriologically controlled, and permanently obturated.  after 2-2.5 yr, the periapical regions were radiographically and histologically examined. of these teeth, 48 root canals were also examined for bacteria remaining after removal of the root fillings. when bacteria remained after the endodontic treatment, 79% of the root canals showed non-healed periapical lesions, compared with 28% where no bacteria were found. combinations of residual bacterial species were more frequently related to non-healed lesions than were single strains. when no bacteria remained, healing occurred independently of the  quality of the root filling. in contrast, when bacteria remained, there was a greater correlation with non-healing in poor-quality root fillings than in technically well-performed fillings. in root canals where bacteria were found after removal of the root filling, 97% had not healed, compared with 18% for those root canals with no bacteria detected. the present study demonstrates the importance of obtaining a bacteria-free root canal system before permanent root filling in order to achieve optimal healing conditions for the periapical tissues.

TI  == incidence and behaviour of tn916-like elements within tetracycline-resistant bacteria isolated from root canals.
AB  == introduction: tetracycline resistance is commonly found in endodontic bacteria. one of the most common tetracycline-resistance genes is tet(m), which is often encoded on the broad-host-range conjugative transposon tn916. this study aimed to determine whether tet(m) was present in bacteria isolated from endodontic patients at the eastman dental institute and whether this gene was carried on the transferable conjugative transposon tn916. methods: the cultivable microflora isolated from 15 endodontic patients was screened for resistance to tetracycline. polymerase chain reactions for tet(m) and for unique regions of tn916 were carried out on the dna of all tetracycline-resistant bacteria. filter-mating experiments were used to see if transfer of any tn916-like elements could occur.  results: eight out of 15 tetracycline-resistant bacteria isolated were shown to possess tet(m). furthermore, four of these eight were shown to possess the tn916-unique regions linked to the tet(m) gene. transfer experiments demonstrated that a neisseria sp. donor could transfer an extremely unstable tn916-like element to enterococcus faecalis. conclusions: the tet(m) gene is present in the  majority of tetracycline-resistant bacteria isolated in this study and the conjugative transposon tn916 has been shown to be responsible for the support and transfer of this gene in some of the bacteria isolated.

AB  == in the present work, escherichia coli dh5alpha was metabolically engineered for coq(10) production by the introduction of decaprenyl diphosphate synthase gene (ddsa) from agrobacterium tumefaciens. grown in 2ytg medium (1.6% tryptone, 1% yeast extract, 0.5% nacl, and 0.5% glycerol) with an initial ph of 7, the recombinant e. coli was capable of coq(10) production up to 470 microg/gdcw (dry  cell weight). this value could be further elevated to 900 microg/gdcw simply by increasing the initial culture ph from 7 to 9. supplementation of 4-hydroxy benzoate did not improve the productivity any further. however, engineering of a  lower mevalonate semi-pathway so as to increase the isopentenyl diphosphate (ipp) supply of the recombinant strain using exogenous mevalonate efficiently increased the coq(10) production. lower mevalonate semi-pathways of staphylococcus aureus,  streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, and saccharomyces cerevisiae were tested. among these, the pathway of streptococcus pneumoniae proved to be superior, yielding coq(10) production of 2,700+/-115 microg/gdcw when supplemented with exogenous mevalonate of 3 mm. in order to construct a complete mevalonate pathway, the upper semi-pathway of the same bacterium, streptococcus pneumoniae, was recruited. in a recombinant e. coli dh5alpha harboring three plasmids encoding for upper and lower mevalonate semi-pathways as well as ddsa enzyme, the heterologous mevalonate pathway could convert endogenous acetyl-coa to ipp, resulting in coq(10) production of up to 2,428+/-75 microg/gdcw, without mevalonate supplementation. in contrast, a whole  mevalonate pathway constructed in a single operon was found to be less efficient. however, it provided coq(10) production of up to 1,706+/-86 microg/gdcw, which was roughly 1.9 times higher than that obtained by ddsa alone.

TI  == bactericidal effect of nd:yag laser irradiation on some endodontic pathogens ex vivo.
AB  == aim: to define the role of neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (nd:yag) lasers in root canal disinfection along with a minimally invasive treatment concept. methodology: the hypothesis was tested ex vivo that nd:yag laser irradiation has  a bactericidal effect on endodontic pathogens inoculated in root canals. resultant colony-forming unit counts were associated with observations of bacterial cell structural changes using conventional scanning electron microscopy (csem) and environmental scanning electron microscopy (esem) on inoculated dentine surfaces, following indirect and direct nd:yag laser irradiation, respectively. results: the nd:yag laser irradiation (1.5 w, 15 hz, four times for 5 s) of enterococcus faecalis inoculated canals resulted in a significant reduction (p < 0.05, wilcoxon signed rank test) of the bacterial load, meaning a  99.7% kill, but no sterilization. the csem procedure verified that the extent of  radiation damage was in line with the total amount of laser energy applied. after 2 h of incubation and three cycles of indirect laser treatment (i.e. through a 1-mm-thick dentine disc), no morphologically intact bacteria of actinomyces naeslundii or streptococcus anginosus were discernible. however, when micro-colonies of s. anginosus and specially biofilms of e. faecalis were present after 2 days, the in situ experiment using esem and direct laser treatment showed that bacterial eradication was reduced in deep layers. conclusions: the nd:yag laser irradiation is not an alternative but a possible supplement to existing protocols for canal disinfection as the properties of laser light may allow a bactericidal effect beyond 1 mm of dentine. endodontic pathogens that grow as biofilms, however, are difficult to eradicate even upon direct laser exposure.

AB  == a dna microarray was developed to detect bacterial genes conferring resistance to macrolides and related antibiotics. a database containing 65 nonredundant genes selected from publicly available dna sequences was constructed and used to design 100 oligonucleotide probes that could specifically detect and discriminate all 65 genes. probes were spotted on a glass slide, and the array was reacted with dna templates extracted from 20 reference strains of eight different bacterial species (streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus, escherichia coli, and bacteroides fragilis) known to harbor 29 different macrolide resistance genes. hybridization results showed that probes reacted with, and only with, the expected dna templates and allowed discovery of three unexpected genes, including msr(sa) in b. fragilis, an efflux gene that has not yet been described for gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == [antibiotic-resistance in italy: activity of the first year of the surveillance project ar-iss].
AB  == the antibiotic resistance surveillance project ar-iss, started in 2001, is based  on a network of 62 sentinel microbiological laboratories throughout the country.  the laboratories collect and transmit data to the istituto superiore di sanita on the antibiotic susceptibility of bloodstream isolates of 7 species: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis/faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca ed escherichia coli. they also send selected bacterial strains for further characterization. results of the first year of surveillance are presented and are compared with data from the previous study earss-italia and from other european countries. oxacillin resistance in s. aureus appears to be stable, however, it remains one of the highest in europe (41,5%). no strain with intermediate susceptibility or resistance to vancomycin has been isolated. in s. pneumoniae, the level of penicillin resistance is moderate (10,8%), but macrolide resistance has increased greatly (37,6% versus 28,6% of the previous study), following a tendency common to several european countries. unexpectedly, vancomycin resistance in e. faecium was found to be 18%, the highest in europe. presumptive esbl production in gram-negative organisms can be  estimated at 20% in klebsiella and 1% in e. coli. ampicillin and ciprofloxacin resistance in e. coli (respectively 50% and 18%) are among the highest in europe. in conclusion, the rate of antibiotic resistance in the species studied is worrisome and requires continuing monitoring. although some activities of ar-iss  need improvements, the surveillance has the potentiality to produce relevant and  representative data about antibiotic resistance in italy that can be used for comparison at the european level.

TI  == artisanal and experimental pecorino siciliano cheese: microbial dynamics during manufacture assessed by culturing and pcr-dgge analyses.
AB  == traditional artisanal pecorino siciliano (ps) cheeses, and two experimental ps cheeses were manufactured using either raw or pasteurised ewes' milk with the addition of starter cultures. the bacterial diversity and dynamics of the different cheese types were evaluated both by culturing and characterisation of isolates, and a culture-independent approach based on the 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene. following cultivation, artisanal and experimental cheese types showed similar microbial counts, and isolates belonging to lactococcus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecalis and leuconostoc mesenteroides were identified by phenotypic characterisation and comparison of the restriction  fragment length polymorphism (rflp) of the 16s rrna gene to that of reference species. the culture-independent fingerprinting technique pcr and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of v6 to v8 regions of the 16s rrna gene of samples taken during artisanal ps cheese manufacture, from raw milk to the ripened cheese, indicated relevant shifts in the microbial community structure. the dominance of streptococcus bovis and lactococcus lactis species in the traditional artisanal ps was revealed by 16s rrna gene sequencing. comparison of  dgge profiles of samples from milk to ripened cheese, derived from artisanal procedure and the two experimental ps cheeses during production showed similar trends with the presence of intense bands in common. nevertheless, the profiles of several artisanal cheeses from different farms appeared more diverse, and these additional species are probably responsible for the generally superior flavour and aroma development of traditional ps cheese.

TI  == bacteriological urinalysis in patients after renal transplantation.
AB  == the study consisted of microbiological urinalysis performed in 269 patients after renal transplantation who remained under medical care at the outpatient service of the transplantation institute in warsaw. the patients enrolled into the study  had undergone renal transplantation 6 to 72 months before urine samples were collected. 304 urinalysis were performed. in the group of 269 patients, 42 individuals had bacteria in their urine what was confirmed in 47 urine cultures.  cases of bacteriuria were divided into 5 groups: 5 cases of symptomatic urinary tract infection (5 individuals--2% of all studied patients), 27 cases of asymptomatic bacteriuria in 22 individuals (8% of all studied patients), 5 cases  of insignificant bacteriuria in 5 patients (2%), 10 cases of involuntary urine contamination in 10 cases (4%). eventually, urinary tract infection (uti) was established in 27 patients (5 cases of symptomatic uti and 22 cases of asymptomatic uti) what makes out for 10% of all studied patients. in cases where  urinalysis showed significant bacteriuria, following pathogens were detected in urine cultures: escherichia coli: 22 strains, enterococcus faecalis--4 strains, enterobacter cloacae--2 strains and 1 strains of ralstonia picketii, streptococcus uberis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis. over 90% of gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to ceftriaxone and ceftazidime, as well as to amikacin and aztreonam which are the drugs usually administered intravenously in hospitalized patients. the only drug of similar efficacy, which  could be administered orally in outpatients was fosfomycin.

TI  == in vitro characterization of the antibacterial spectrum of novel bacterial type ii topoisomerase inhibitors of the aminobenzimidazole class.
AB  == antibiotics with novel mechanisms of action are becoming increasingly important in the battle against bacterial resistance to all currently used classes of antibiotics. bacterial dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv (topoiv) are the familiar  targets of fluoroquinolone and coumarin antibiotics. here we present the characterization of two members of a new class of synthetic bacterial topoii atpase inhibitors: vrt-125853 and vrt-752586. these aminobenzimidazole compounds  were potent inhibitors of both dna gyrase and topoiv and had excellent antibacterial activities against a wide spectrum of problematic pathogens responsible for both nosocomial and community-acquired infections, including staphylococci, streptococci, enterococci, and mycobacteria. consistent with the novelty of their structures and mechanisms of action, antibacterial potency was unaffected by commonly encountered resistance phenotypes, including fluoroquinolone resistance. in time-kill assays, vrt-125853 and vrt-752586 were bactericidal against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, and haemophilus influenzae, causing 3-log reductions in viable cells within 24 h. finally, similar to the fluoroquinolones, relatively low frequencies of spontaneous resistance to vrt-125853 and vrt-752586 were found, a property consistent with their in vitro dual-targeting activities.

TI  == characterization of ers, a prfa-like regulator of enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == we have identified a transcriptional regulator, named ers (for enterococcal regulator of survival), of enterococcus faecalis, an important opportunistic bacterium commonly recovered from hospitalized patients. ers is a member of the crp/fnr family and is 69% similar to srv, a prfa-like regulator of streptococcus  pyogenes implicated in virulence, and is the e. faecalis protein most closely related to prfa, a positive regulator of virulence genes in listeria monocytogenes. in an in vivo-in vitro macrophage infection model, the survival of an ers mutant was highly significantly decreased compared with that of the parental strain jh2-2. this mutant was more than 10-fold more sensitive to oxidative challenge by hydrogen peroxide. in order to identify genes whose expression was under ers control, the rna levels of 31 likely candidates were measured by real-time quantitative pcr. the results indicate that ers may be autoregulated and that the locus ef0082 appears to be positively regulated by ers. nevertheless, mutation of ef0082 did not result in any detectable changes in the survival of the bacterium within murine macrophages.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of a novel peptide deformylase inhibitor, lbm415, tested against respiratory tract and cutaneous infection pathogens: a global surveillance report (2003-2004).
AB  == objectives: to evaluate the spectrum of activity and potency of lbm415, the first of the peptide deformylase inhibitor (pdfi) class to be developed for treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections and uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections (ussti), against a large, contemporary international collection of targeted pathogens collected during 2003-2004. methods: a total of  21,636 isolates were tested by reference broth microdilution methods as part of a longitudinal international antimicrobial resistance surveillance study. characteristics of the organism collection included resistance to oxacillin among 35.0% of staphylococcus aureus and 76.0% of coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons); resistance to penicillin (mic > or = 2 mg/l) among 18.0% of streptococcus pneumoniae; vancomycin resistance among 20.0% of enterococcus spp. and ampicillin resistance among 22.0% of haemophilus influenzae. results: lbm415 displayed potent activity against staphylococci, streptococci, enterococcus faecium and moraxella catarrhalis, with > or = 99.0% of strains being inhibited at < or = 4 mg/l; 97.0% of enterococcus faecalis isolates and 92.0% of h. influenzae isolates were also inhibited at this concentration. seventy-seven percent of burkholderia  cepacia and 82.0% of stenotrophomonas maltophilia were inhibited at < or = 8 mg/l. no differences in lbm415 activity against s. aureus, cons, s. pneumoniae, enterococcus spp. and h. influenzae were detected for subsets susceptible or resistant to antimicrobials such as oxacillin, penicillin, ampicillin, macrolides, vancomycin and fluoroquinolones. while regional differences were apparent with some comparator agents, sensitivity to lbm415 did not vary significantly among strains from the various geographic areas sampled. one isolate of s. aureus displayed high-level resistance to lbm415 owing to multiple  sequence changes in resistance phenotype genes (defb and fmt), despite the absence of the compound in clinical practice. this isolate remained susceptible to all other antimicrobials tested except for penicillin. conclusions: with few differences detected among strains from various geographic regions, the first pdfi class agent to enter clinical development has consistently demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against commonly isolated pathogens associated with uncomplicated respiratory and cutaneous infections. these compounds represent a significant therapeutic advance owing to their novel mechanism of action and antibacterial spectrum, including activity against resistant organisms, should pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters support their continued development. given the detection of a pre-existing pdfi-resistant isolate of s. aureus as demonstrated here, surveillance for resistance among the pdfi-targeted  pathogens following introduction of this class of agent into clinical usage will  be an important component of future studies.

TI  == activity of gatifloxacin tested against isolates from pediatric patients: report  from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (north america, 1998-2003).
AB  == the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program has monitored the activity of antimicrobial agents worldwide since 1997. the increasing number of clinical failures with established anti-infectives (penicillins, other beta-lactams, macrolides) among pediatric patients has stressed the importance for alternative  therapeutic options. ciprofloxacin has been recently approved for expanded use as treatment of complicated urinary tract infections in children, and gatifloxacin has been used successfully in clinical trials in selected children with severe or refractory otitis media. we evaluated the activity of gatifloxacin against strains isolated from children < 7 years of age and compared this to the general  patient population (all ages included) using the sentry program database. a total of 59826 north american isolates were collected, of which 4641 were from children (< 7 years old); all isolates were tested using reference broth microdilution methods. in contrast to the general population (gp), gatifloxacin resistance rates were very low among isolates from this younger patient group. gatifloxacin  susceptibility rates were > 84% for all pathogens evaluated in younger patients.  all streptococcus pneumoniae strains from children < 7 years old were susceptible to gatifloxacin, and susceptibility among the enterobacteriaceae species was > 98%. the greatest difference in susceptibility rates between the younger children and the gp was observed among nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli (95.0-100% versus 64.8-83.7%, respectively) and enterococcus faecalis (94.7% versus 58.4%).  gatifloxacin susceptibilities of pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. isolates from the pediatric population were > or = 95% (> 97% for ciprofloxacin)  compared to the gp at only 64.8-69.1%. in conclusion, gatifloxacin remains very active against bacterial isolates from children < 7 years, indicative of the limited exposure of this population to fluoroquinolones. continued resistance surveillance will be necessary to monitor the activity of the fluoroquinolone class as they are introduced for specific clinical indications into the pediatric age groups, especially if re-studied against s. pneumoniae (refractory otitis media) and p. aeruginosa (cystic fibrosis associated pneumonia).

TI  == promotion of opsonization by antibodies and phagocytosis of gram-positive bacteria by a bifunctional polyacrylamide.
AB  == this paper describes the application of a bifunctional polyacrylamide (pa-v-f) presenting both vancomycin and fluorescein groups, to modify the surfaces of multiple species of gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis) to control molecular recognition of these surfaces. the vancomycin groups allowed the specific recognition of a structural component of the bacterial cell wall: peptides terminated in d-ala-d-ala. the fluorescein groups allowed the imaging of binding of polymer to the surfaces of bacteria by fluorescence, and are representative, low molecular weight haptens; their recognition by anti-fluorescein antibodies provides proof-of-principle that bifunctional polymers can be used to introduce haptens onto the surface of the bacteria. flow  cytometry revealed that polymer-labeled s. aureus and s. pneumoniae were opsonized by anti-fluorescein antibodies approximately 20-fold more than were untreated bacteria; nearly all ( approximately 92%) polymer-labeled s. aureus, and a large (76%) fraction of polymer-labeled s. pneumoniae were opsonized. the bound antibodies then promoted phagocytosis of the bacteria by cultured j774 macrophage-like cells. flow cytometry revealed that macrophages ingested s. aureus decorated with the polymer-antibody complexes approximately 2-fold more efficiently than s. aureus in control groups, in spite of the high background (caused by efficient antibody-independent ingestion of s. aureus by macrophages). this paper, thus, demonstrates the ability of a bifunctional polymer to carry out three distinct functions based on polyvalent molecular recognition: (i) recognition of the surface of gram-positive bacteria, (ii) modification of this surface to generate specific binding sites recognized by an antibody, and (iii) promotion of phagocytosis of the opsonized bacteria.

TI  == the traa relaxase autoregulates the putative type iv secretion-like system encoded by the broad-host-range streptococcus agalactiae plasmid pip501.
AB  == the conjugative multiple antibiotic resistance plasmid pip501 can be transferred  and stably maintained in a variety of gram-positive genera, including multicellular streptomyces lividans, as well as in gram-negative escherichia coli. the 15 putative pip501 transfer (tra) genes are organized in an operon-like structure terminating in a strong transcriptional terminator. this paper reports  co-transcription of the pip501 tra genes in exponentially growing enterococcus faecalis jh2-2 cells, as shown by rt-pcr. the tra genes are expressed throughout  the life cycle of ent. faecalis, and the expression level is independent of the growth phase. electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that the traa relaxase, the first gene of the tra operon, binds to the tra promoter p(tra), which partially overlaps with the origin of transfer (orit). dnase i footprinting experiments further delimited the traa binding region and defined the nucleotides bound by traa. beta-galactosidase assays with p(tra)-lacz fusions proved p(tra) promoter activity, which was strongly repressed when traa was supplied in trans.  thus, it is concluded that the pip501 tra operon is negatively autoregulated at the transcriptional level by the conjugative dna relaxase traa.

TI  == the s(mk) box is a new sam-binding rna for translational regulation of sam synthetase.
AB  == we have identified the s(mk) box as a conserved rna motif in the 5' untranslated  leader region of metk (sam synthetase) genes in lactic acid bacteria, including enterococcus, streptococcus and lactococcus species. this rna element bound sam in vitro, and binding of sam caused an rna structural rearrangement that resulted in sequestration of the shine-dalgarno (sd) sequence. mutations that disrupted pairing between the sd region and a sequence complementary to the sd blocked sam  binding, whereas compensatory mutations that restored pairing restored sam binding. the enterococcus faecalis s(mk) box conferred translational repression of a lacz reporter when cells were grown under conditions where sam pools are elevated, and mutations that blocked sam binding resulted in loss of repression,  demonstrating that the s(mk) box is functional in vivo. the s(mk) box therefore represents a new sam-binding riboswitch distinct from the previously identified s box rnas.

AB  == there are no experimental studies regarding the prophylactic efficacy of linezolid against infective endocarditis. nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis of the aortic valve was induced in rabbits by the insertion of a polyethylene catheter. twenty-four hours later, animals were randomly assigned to a control group, and groups receiving either ampicillin (two doses of 40 mg/kg of body weight each, given intravenously, 2 h apart) or linezolid (a single per os dose of 75 mg/kg). the first dose of ampicillin and the single dose of linezolid were  administered 0.5 and 1 h, respectively, prior to the intravenous inoculation of approximately 10(7) cfu of streptococcus oralis or enterococcus faecalis. linezolid peak levels in rabbit serum were similar to the peak serum levels in humans following a 600-mg oral dose of linezolid. linezolid prevented endocarditis in 87% of s. oralis-challenged rabbits (p < 0.001 versus controls; p = 0.026 versus ampicillin). in rabbits challenged with e. faecalis, linezolid prevented endocarditis in 73% (p = 0.003 versus controls; p = 0.049 versus ampicillin). ampicillin prevented endocarditis due to s. oralis or due to e. faecalis in 47% (p = 0.005 versus controls) and in 30% (p = not significant versus controls) of the challenged animals, respectively. in conclusion, linezolid was effective as prophylaxis against endocarditis caused by a strain of s. oralis and to a lesser degree against that caused by a strain of e. faecalis.  its prophylactic efficacy was superior to that of ampicillin.

AB  == a series of 3,5-dioxopyrazolidines was identified as novel inhibitors of udp-n-acetylenolpyruvylglucosamine reductase (murb). compounds 1 to 3, which are  1,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-3,5-dioxopyrazolidine-4-carboxamides, inhibited escherichia coli murb, staphyloccocus aureus murb, and e. coli mura with 50% inhibitory concentrations (ic50s) in the range of 4.1 to 6.8 microm, 4.3 to 10.3  microm, and 6.8 to 29.4 microm, respectively. compound 4, a c-4-unsubstituted 1,2-bis(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3,5-dioxopyrazolidine, showed moderate inhibitory activity against e. coli murb, s. aureus murb, and e. coli murc (ic50s, 24.5 to 35 microm). a fluorescence-binding assay indicated tight binding of compound 3 with e. coli murb, giving a dissociation constant of 260 nm. structural characterization of e. coli murb was undertaken, and the crystal structure of a complex with compound 4 was obtained at 2.4 a resolution. the crystal structure indicated the binding of a compound at the active site of murb and specific interactions with active-site residues and the bound flavin adenine dinucleotide  cofactor. peptidoglycan biosynthesis studies using a strain of staphylococcus epidermidis revealed reduced peptidoglycan biosynthesis upon incubation with 3,5-dioxopyrazolidines, with ic50s of 0.39 to 11.1 microm. antibacterial activity was observed for compounds 1 to 3 (mics, 0.25 to 16 microg/ml) and 4 (mics, 4 to  8 microg/ml) against gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant s. aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae.

TI  == comparison of the effect of delayed entry into 2 different blood culture systems  (bactec 9240 and bact/alert 3d) on culture positivity.
AB  == the effect of delayed entry (2-48 h) into bactalert 3d and bactec 9240 and the effect of 2 storage temperatures (22 degrees c vs 35 degrees c) on bacterial growth was evaluated. the delay in transportation of blood culture bottles stored at room temperature had no effect on the recovery rate for the first 12 h. culture positivity was between 74.4% and 100% for different microorganisms at less than 24 h preincubation time. the positivity rate decreased significantly for acinetobacter baumannii, bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and streptococcus pneumoniae for more than 24 h of delay. culture positivity was higher at 22 degrees c for all microorganisms especially for enterococcus faecalis and p. aeruginosa. effects of instrument, preincubation time, and temperature showed that the risk of culture negativity increased 1.5 times for bactec compared with  bactalert 3d and increased 2.5 times for 35 degrees c compared with 22 degrees c. the negativity increased 5.5 times and 8.5 times at 24 and 48 h of delay respectively, compared with no delay.

TI  == bloodstream infections in organ transplant recipients receiving alemtuzumab: no evidence of occurrence of organisms typically associated with profound t cell depletion.
AB  == background: alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against cd52, a cell surface antigen expressed on b and t lymphocytes, monocytes and nk cells.  its use results in a profound decrease in cd4 positive t lymphocytes. alemtuzumab is used as induction immunosuppression and therapy for rejection in organ transplant recipients in some centers. we followed a cohort of 449 consecutive transplant recipients who received alemtuzumab to determine the occurrence of bloodstream infections, particularly those previously associated with decrease in cd4 positive t lymphocytes. patients and methods: fifteen percent (69/449) patients had at least one episode of bloodstream infection. however, no patient had bacteremia with streptococcus pneumoniae, listeria monocytogenes, non-typhoidal salmonella or mycobacterium avium complex. fungaemia was rare, occurring in 1.5% of patients. the most common organisms isolated from the blood  were staphylococcus aureus (21 episodes), coagulase negative staphylococcus (14 episodes), klebsiella pneumoniae (12 episodes), enterococcus faecium (11 episodes), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10 episodes), enterococcus faecalis (9 episodes) and escherichia coli (7 episodes). discussion: we conclude that although alemtuzumab use is associated with profound cd4 positive t lymphocyte depletion, alemtuzumab does not seem to be associated with an increased risk of bloodstream infection with pathogens typically seen in other disorders of cd4 cell depletion, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.

TI  == activity of a new oral streptogramin, xrp2868, against gram-positive cocci harboring various mechanisms of resistance to streptogramins.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of xrp2868, a new oral streptogramin composed of a combination of rpr132552 (streptogramin a) and rpr202868 (streptogramin b), was evaluated against a collection of clinical gram-positive isolates with characterized phenotypes and genotypes of streptogramin resistance. the effects of genes for resistance to streptogramin a or b on the activity of xrp2868 and its components were also tested by cloning these genes individually or in various combinations in gram-positive recipient strains susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin. the species tested included staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, and other species of streptococci. xrp2868 was generally fourfold more potent than quinupristin-dalfopristin against s. aureus,  e. faecium, and streptococci and had activity against e. faecalis (mics = 0.25 to 1 microg/ml). xrp2868 appeared to be affected by the same mechanisms of resistance as those to quinupristin-dalfopristin. nevertheless, the strong activity of factor a of the oral streptogramin enabled the combination to be very potent against streptogramin-susceptible staphylococci, streptococci, and e. faecium (mics = 0.03 to 0.25 microg/ml) and to retain low mics against the strains harboring a mechanism of resistance to factor a or factor b of the streptogramin. however, the combination of mechanisms of resistance to factors a  and b caused an increase in the mics of xrp2868, which reached 1 to 4 mug/ml. as  with the other streptogramins, there was a reduction in the bactericidal effect of xrpr2868 when the staphylococcal strains acquired a constitutively expressed erm gene.

TI  == flavonoid analysis and antimicrobial activity of commercially available propolis  products.
AB  == propolis ethanolic solutions are the most used propolis products on the market for the treatment of minor ulcers in the mouth, angina, thrush or skin infections. since it is still an unofficial drug in pharmacy, we analyzed the contents of flavonoids in ten commercially available ethanolic solutions of propolis from the croatian market using two complementary colorimetric methods. antimicrobial activities, determined with the diffusion method, against six bacterial species (bacillus subtilis nctc 8236, staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, streptococcus pyogenes atcc 12204, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, escherichia  coli atcc 10536, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, and one yeast-like fungus candida albicans atcc 10231 were compared. results of flavonoids analysis suggested that the contents of flavones and flavonols in the products were uniform and ranged from 0.14 to 0.41%, but the content of flavanones varied greatly from 0.43 to 18.78%. total flavonoid content, as the sum of two colorimetric methods, in propolis products was between 0.78 and 18.92%, and most  products had the flavonoids content below 9%. all products with the total flavonoids content above 1% showed antimicrobial activity against the four gram-positive bacterial species tested, and against p. aeruginosa and the yeast-like fungus c. albicans. total flavonoids contents, expressed as the sum of two colorimetric methods, could be useful methods for estimating the flavonoid contents of propolis products. our results indicate that the quality of commercially available propolis products requires verification.

TI  == modulation of antibody-mediated immune response by probiotics in chickens.
AB  == probiotic bacteria, including lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum, have been shown to enhance antibody responses in mammals. the objective  of this study was to examine the effects of a probiotic product containing the above bacteria in addition to streptococcus faecalis on the induction of the chicken antibody response to various antigens, both systemically and in the gut.  the birds received probiotics via oral gavage and subsequently were immunized with sheep red blood cells (srbc) and bovine serum albumin (bsa) to evaluate antibody responses in serum or with tetanus toxoid (tt) to measure the mucosal antibody response in gut contents. control groups received phosphate-buffered saline. overall, bsa and srbc induced a detectable antibody response as early as  week 1 postimmunization (p.i.), which lasted until week 3 p.i. probiotic-treated  birds had significantly (p <or= 0.001) more serum antibody (predominantly immunoglobulin m [igm]) to srbc than the birds that were not treated with probiotics. however, treatment with probiotics did not enhance the serum igm and  igg antibody responses to bsa. immunization with tt resulted in the presence of specific iga and igg antibody responses in the gut. again, treatment with probiotics did not change the level or duration of the antibody response in the gut. in conclusion, probiotics enhance the systemic antibody response to some antigens in chickens, but it remains to be seen whether probiotics have an effect on the generation of the mucosal antibody response.

TI  == the role of 16s rrna gene sequencing in identification of microorganisms misidentified by conventional methods.
AB  == traditional methods for microbial identification require the recognition of differences in morphology, growth, enzymatic activity, and metabolism to define genera and species. full and partial 16s rrna gene sequencing methods have emerged as useful tools for identifying phenotypically aberrant microorganisms. we report on three bacterial blood isolates from three different college of american pathologists-certified laboratories that were referred to arup laboratories for definitive identification. because phenotypic identification suggested unusual organisms not typically associated with the submitted clinical  diagnosis, consultation with the medical director was sought and further testing  was performed including partial 16s rrna gene sequencing. all three patients had  endocarditis, and conventional methods identified isolates from patients a, b, and c as a facklamia sp., eubacterium tenue, and a bifidobacterium sp. 16s rrna gene sequencing identified the isolates as enterococcus faecalis, cardiobacterium valvarum, and streptococcus mutans, respectively. we conclude that the initial identifications of these three isolates were erroneous, may have misled clinicians, and potentially impacted patient care. 16s rrna gene sequencing is a  more objective identification tool, unaffected by phenotypic variation or technologist bias, and has the potential to reduce laboratory errors.

TI  == acquired antimicrobial resistance in the intestinal microbiota of diverse cat populations.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of acquired antimicrobial resistance in the resident intestinal microbiota of cats and to identify significant differences between various cat populations. escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium and streptococcus canis were isolated as faecal indicator bacteria from rectal swabs of 47 individually owned cats, 47 cattery cats and 18 hospitalised cats, and submitted through antimicrobial sensitivity tests. the results revealed that bacteria isolated from hospitalised and/or cattery cats were more frequently resistant than those from individually owned cats. e. coli isolates from hospitalised cats were particularly resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline and sulfonamide. both enterococci and streptococci showed high resistance to tetracycline and in somewhat lesser extent to erythromycin and tylosin. most e. faecium isolates were resistant to lincomycin and penicillin. one e. faecalis as well as one e. faecium isolate from hospitalised cats showed 'high-level resistance' (mic > 500 microg/ml) against gentamicin, a commonly used antimicrobial agent in case of human enterococcal infections. the results of this research demonstrate that the extent of acquired  antimicrobial resistance in the intestinal microbiota of cats depends on the social environment of the investigated population. it is obvious that the flora of healthy cats may act as a reservoir of resistance genes.

TI  == ability of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 to participate in bacterial translocation across the intestinal epithelial barrier.
AB  == although hundreds of microbial species reside in the human intestinal tract, comparatively few (e.g., escherichia coli and other enterobacteria, enterococcus  faecalis, etc.) are typically associated with systemic infection in postsurgical, shock, and trauma patients. syndecan-1 is the predominant cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed on epithelia, and there is substantial evidence that heparan sulfate participates in interactions of a variety of frankly pathogenic microbes with mammalian cells. to investigate the role of syndecan-1 in interactions of enteric flora with intestinal epithelium, bacteria that might  use the enterocyte as a portal of entry for systemic infection (including e. faecalis, e. coli, and other enterobacteria, and several species of staphylococci and streptococci) were studied for their abilities to interact with syndecan-1. streptococcus bovis, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and s. epidermidis showed increased adherence to arh-77 cells transfected to express syndecan-1. heparin, a heparan sulfate analog, inhibited internalization of s. bovis, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, and s. aureus by ht-29 enterocytes (prominent  syndecan-1 expression), but not caco-2 enterocytes (relatively low syndecan-1 expression). data from experiments with chinese hamster ovary cells with altered  glycosaminoglycan expression indicated that heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate (glycosaminoglycans on the syndecan-1 ectodomain) participated in bacterial interactions with mammalian cells. thus, although e. faecalis, e. coli, and other gram-negative enterobacteria did not appear to interact with syndecan-1, this heparan sulfate proteoglycan may mediate enterocyte interactions with some staphylococci and streptococci that are known to cause systemic infections in specific populations of high-risk, immunosuppressed, postsurgical,  and trauma patients.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sm-216601, a new broad-spectrum  parenteral carbapenem.
AB  == sm-216601 is a novel parenteral 1beta-methylcarbapenem. in agar dilution susceptibility testing, the mic of sm-216601 for 90% of the methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) strains tested (mic(90)) was 2 microg/ml, which was  comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid. sm-216601 was also very potent against enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-resistant strains (mic(90) = 8 microg/ml). sm-216601 exhibited potent activity against penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae, moraxella  catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis, with mic(90)s of less than 0.5 microg/ml, and intermediate activity against citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas  aeruginosa. the therapeutic efficacy of sm-216601 against experimentally induced  infections in mice caused by s. aureus, e. faecium, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa reflected its in vitro activity and plasma level. thus, sm-216601 is a promising  candidate for nosocomial bacterial infections caused by a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including multiresistant pathogens.

TI  == molecular analysis of colonized bacteria in a human newborn infant gut.
AB  == the complex ecosystem of intestinal microflora is estimated to harbor approximately 400 different microbial species, mostly bacteria. however, studies  on bacterial colonization have mostly been based on culturing methods, which only detect a small fraction of the whole microbiotic ecosystem of the gut. to clarify the initial acquisition and subsequent colonization of bacteria in an infant within the few days after birth, phylogenetic analysis was performed using 16s rdna sequences from the dna isolated from feces on the 1st, 3rd, and 6th day. 16s rdna libraries were constructed with the amplicons of pcr conditions at 30 cycles and 50 degrees c annealing temperature. nine independent libraries were produced  by the application of three sets of primers (set a, set b, and set c) combined with three fecal samples for day 1, day 3, and day 6 of life. approximately 220 clones (76.7%) of all 325 isolated clones were characterized as known species, while other 105 clones (32.3%) were characterized as unknown species. the library clone with set a universal primers amplifying 350 bp displayed increased diversity by days. thus, set a primers were better suited for this type of molecular ecological analysis. on the first day of the life of the infant, enterobacter, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, and streptococcus mitis were present. the largest taxonomic group was l. lactis. on the third day of the  life of the infant, enterobacter, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, s. mitis, and streptococcus salivarius were present. on the sixth day of the life of the infant, citrobacter, clostridium difficile, enterobacter sp., enterobacter cloacae, and e. coli were present. the largest taxonomic group was e. coli. these results showed that microbiotic diversity changes very rapidly in the few days after birth, and the acquisition of unculturable bacteria expanded rapidly after  the third day.

TI  == enumeration and speciation of enterococci found in marine and intertidal sediments and coastal water in southern california.
AB  == aims: to determine the levels and species distribution of enterococci in intertidal and marine sediments and coastal waters at two beaches frequently in violation of bacterial water standards. methods and results: faecal indicator bacteria were extracted from sediment and enumerated using membrane filtration. high levels of enterococci were detected in intertidal sediments in a seasonal river and near a storm drain outlet. low levels were found in marine sediments at 10 m depths and in surf zone sand. bacterial isolates presumptively identified as enterococcus on mei media were speciated. the predominant species found in both water and sediment included enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus mundtii. a number of isolates (11-26%) from regulatory water samples presumptively identified as enterococci on mei media were subsequently identified as species other than enterococcus. at both study sites, the distribution of species present in water was comparable with those in sediments and the distribution of species was similar in water samples passing and exceeding bacterial indicator standards. conclusions: high levels of enterococcus in intertidal sediments indicate retention and possible regrowth in this environment. significance and impact of the study: resuspension of enterococci that are persistent in sediments may cause beach water quality failures and calls into question the specificity of this indicator for determining recent faecal contamination.

TI  == pd-140248 (parke-davis & co).
AB  == pd-140248 is an isomerase inhibitor and topoisomerase ii inhibitor under development by parke-davis and co as a potential treatment for bacterial infection. although no details of active development have been published in the scientific literature since 1996, in september 1999, the company confirmed that pd-140248 is still in active development [338530]. the compound is one of two new pyrrolidinyl naphthyridines (the other compound being pd-131628) with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, including activity against quinolone-resistant bacteria. pd-140248 demonstrates strong in vitro activity, particularly against gram-positive bacteria, such as quinolone-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (s aureus), staphylococcus epidermidis (s epidermidis), staphylococcus haemolyticus (s haemolyticus), methicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant s aureus, streptococcus species, streptococcus pneumoniae (s pneumoniae) and enterococcus faecalis (e faecalis). an mic90 value of 0.015 microg/ml was obtained against haemophilus influenzae (h influenzae) and moraxella catarrhalis [160129]. the (3r,1s) enantiomer, pd-140248, demonstrated a 1- to 10-fold enhanced activity against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms in vitro and in vivo compared to its stereoisomers, and has thus been targeted for further preclinical studies [133377].

TI  == antimicrobial activity and tightness of a dcpd-cao-based hydraulic calcium phosphate cement for root canal filling.
AB  == calcium hydroxide is currently used in dentistry for endodontic treatments where  its main advantage is its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity. however,  it also has some drawbacks such as pulp necrosis, slight solubility, slow and insufficient hardening, and retraction on drying. in consequence, it is used only as temporary material for root canal disinfection. by mixing calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (cahpo4 . 2h2o, also called dicalcium phosphate dihydrate, dcpd) and calcium oxide with a sodium phosphate buffer as liquid phase, we obtained a cpc with better mechanical properties than calcium hydroxide pastes. the setting reaction produced either hydroxyapatite (ha) or a mixture of ha and calcium hydroxide depending on the relative masses of dcpd and cao in the cement  powder. the presence of calcium hydroxide a priori confers antimicrobial properties to this cement which were investigated in agar plates (diffusion method) against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, candida albicans, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus hominis (clinical isolates), and  a preparation of polymicrobial flora isolated from dental plaque. the cement samples tested were prepared at molar calcium-to-phosphate ratios (ca/p) of 1.67  to 2.75. a pure calcium hydroxide paste was used as reference material. clear and reproducible bacterial growth inhibition was observed for cement samples with ca/p > or = 2 against all the microorganisms tested. with ca/p = 2.5, this cement alkalinizes dentinal tubules and provides a fluid-tight sealing that well compares with sealing obtained using a zinc oxide-eugenol cement without gutta-percha point. dcpd-cao-based cement is therefore a potential root canal filler.

TI  == enterococcus faecalis sex pheromone plasmid pam373: analyses of traa and evidence for its interaction with rpob.
AB  == the enterococcus faecalis plasmid pam373 (36.7kb) encodes a mating response to the sex pheromone cam373 secreted by recipient (plasmid-free) bacteria. like certain other conjugative enterococcal plasmids, a key regulator of the pheromone response is a negatively acting protein, traa, which is believed to interact with internalized pheromone to influence expression from a key transcriptional promoter p(0). an earlier report showed that in the case of pam373 most, but not  all, transposon-insertion mutations in traa differed from those in the case of pad1 and pcf10 in that they did not give rise to the normally characteristic constitutive clumping. we show here that this phenomenon relates to a host effect involving an rpob-related mutation associated with rifampin resistance. when harboring traa mutants, rifampin-sensitive hosts exhibited constitutive clumping, whereas rifampin-resistant hosts did not-despite the fact that the latter host exhibited a normal pheromone-inducible clumping response when harboring a wild-type plasmid. the data imply that traa normally remains associated with the  transcription complex after induction. in addition the promoter of traa, designated p(a), was shown to be located about 600bp upstream of the translational start site, as clones containing traa required this site to complement traa mutants in trans. transcription from p(a) also gave rise to a short (130 nt) transcript, md, expressed at a high level in uninduced cells. an earlier observation suggesting that traa negatively affected transcriptional readthrough into the 3' end of traa from the t(ac) intrinsic bidirectional terminator between traa and the opposing, adjacent trac was supported by traa complementation studies. evidence is also presented suggesting that this regulation at t(ac) also involves an additional, possibly cis-acting, element.

AB  == propolis means a gum that is gathered by bees from various plants. it is known for its biological properties, having antibacterial, antifungal and healing properties. the aims of this study were to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of four different anatolian propolis samples on different groups of microorganisms including some oral pathogens and comparison between their chemical compositions. ethanol extracts of propolis (eep) were prepared from four different anatolian propolis samples and examined whether eep inhibit the growth of the test microorganisms or not. for the antimicrobial activity assays, minimum inhibitory  concentrations (mic) were determined by using macrodilution method. the mic values of the most effective propolis (tb) were 2 microg/ml for streptococcus sobrinus and enterococcus faecalis, 4 microg/ml for micrococcus luteus, candida albicans and c. krusei, 8 microg/ml for streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterobacter aerogenes, 16 microg/ml for escherichia coli and c. tropicalis and 32 microg/ml for salmonella typhimurium and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the chemical compositions of eep's were determined by high-temperature high-resolution gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. the main compounds of four anatolian propolis samples were flavonoids such as pinocembrin, pinostropin, isalpinin, pinobanksin, quercetin, naringenin, galangine and chrysin. although propolis samples were collected from different regions of anatolia all showed significant antimicrobial activity against the gram positive bacteria and yeasts. propolis can prevent dental caries since it demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms such as streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus and c. albicans, which involves in oral diseases.

TI  == enterococcus faecalis diviva: an essential gene involved in cell division, cell growth and chromosome segregation.
AB  == enterococcus faecalis diviva (divivaef) is an essential gene implicated in cell division and chromosome segregation. this gene was disrupted by insertional inactivation creating e. faecalis jhsr1, which was viable only when a wild-type copy of divivaef was expressed in trans, confirming the essentiality of the gene. the absence of divivaef in e. faecalis jhsr1 inhibited proper cell division, which resulted in abnormal cell clusters possessing enlarged cells of altered shape instead of the characteristic diplococcal morphology of enterococci. the lower viability of the divivaef mutant is caused by improper nucleoid segregation and impaired septation within the numerous cells generated in each cluster. overexpression of divivaef in escherichia coli kjb24 resulted in enlarged cells with disrupted cell division, suggesting that this round e. coli mutant strain could be used as an indicator for functionality of divivaef. a bacillus subtilis  diviva mutant was not complemented by divivaef, indicating that this protein does not recognize diviva-specific target sites in b. subtilis, or that it does not interact with other proteins of the cell division machinery of this micro-organism. divivaef also failed to complement a streptococcus pneumoniae diviva mutant, supporting the phylogenetic distance between enterococcus and streptococcus. our results indicate that diviva is a species-specific multifunctional protein implicated in cell division and chromosome segregation in e. faecalis.

TI  == zygomatic abscess with temporal myositis - a rare extracranial complication of acute otitis media.
AB  == acute mastoiditis is the most common complication of acute otitis media (aom) and its early recognition and management still poses a challenge due to potentially serious consequences. the incidences of extracranial and intracranial suppurative complications of aom in children have decreased significantly, yet they remain a  serious clinical problem, especially when caused by bacteria resistant to antibiotics. the authors presented a case of rare aom complication - zygomatic abscess with temporal myositis. a 6-year-old boy was admitted to the ent department with 4 weeks of ear pain, treated for aom with cefuroxime axetyl and amoxicilline, with acute mastoiditis and subsequent abscess formation in zygomatic and preauricular region. the inflammatory process spread through anterior air cells to the zygomatic cells leading to a fistula formation in the zygomatic bone and breakthrough into the temporal muscle. the surgical procedures applied were: myringotomy with drainage, cortical mastoidectomy and revision of zygomatic area and treatment with antibiotics (ceftriaxon). enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus viridans were found in the culture of middle ear and mastoid effusion. after half a year of follow-up the child had a normal hearing. severe complications of aom are rare today. an early diagnosis in order to promote adequate management and prevent inherently suppurative complications is essential.

AB  == the utility of (1)h nmr spectroscopy is suggested and demonstrated for the diagnosis of pseudomonas aeruginosa in urinary tract infection (uti). the specific property of p. aeruginosa of metabolizing nicotinic acid to 6-hydroxynicotinic acid (6-ohna) is exploited. the quantity of 6-ohna produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. other common bacteria causing uti such as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia, enterobacter aerogenes, acinetobacter baumanii, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter frundii, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus gp b and staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize nicotinic acid under similar conditions. the method provides a single-step documentation of p. aeruginosa qualitatively as well as quantitatively. the nmr method is demonstrated on urine samples from 30 patients with uti caused by p. aeruginosa.

TI  == selection and characterization of a promoter for expression of single-copy recombinant genes in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background: in the past ten years there has been a growing interest in engineering gram-positive bacteria for biotechnological applications, including vaccine delivery and production of recombinant proteins. usually, bacteria are manipulated using plasmid expression vectors. the major limitation of this approach is due to the fact that recombinant plasmids are often lost from the bacterial culture upon removal of antibiotic selection. we have developed a genetic system based on suicide vectors on conjugative transposons allowing stable integration of recombinant dna into the chromosome of transformable and non-transformable gram-positive bacteria. results: the aim of this work was to select a strong chromosomal promoter from streptococcus gordonii to improve this  genetic system making it suitable for expression of single-copy recombinant genes. to achieve this task, a promoterless gene encoding a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat), was randomly integrated into the s. gordonii chromosome  and transformants were selected for chloramphenicol resistance. three out of eighteen chloramphenicol resistant transformants selected exhibited 100% stability of the phenotype and only one of them, gp215, carried the cat gene integrated as a single copy. a dna fragment of 600 base pairs exhibiting promoter activity was isolated from gp215 and sequenced. the 5' end of its corresponding mrna was determined by primer extention analysis and the putative -10 and a -35 regions were identified. to study the possibility of using this promoter (pp) for single copy heterologous gene expression, we created transcriptional fusions of pp with genes encoding surface recombinant proteins in a vector capable of integrating into the conjugative transposon tn916. surface recombinant proteins whose expression was controlled by the pp promoter were detected in tn916-containing strains of s. gordonii and bacillus subtilis after single copy chromosomal integration of the recombinant insertion vectors into the resident tn916. the surface recombinant protein synthesized under the control of pp was also detected in enterococcus faecalis after conjugal transfer of a recombinant tn916 containing the transcriptional fusion. conclusion: we isolated and characterized a s. gordonii chromosomal promoter. we demonstrated that this promoter can be used to direct expression of heterologous genes in different gram-positive bacteria, when integrated in a single copy into the chromosome.

AB  == introduction: the objective of the study was to know the current situation of the antimicrobial sensitivity patterns of the main multi-resistant bacteria and to analyze any possible changes with respect to the vira study carried out in 2001.  methods: the 40 participating hospitals sent a total of 1,425 microorganisms isolated in february 2004, distributed as follows: penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (139), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (289), clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (158), ampicillin-resistant enterococcus faecium (89) and enterococcus faecalis (2), ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae (85), ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli (346), pseudomonas aeruginosa (187), and acinetobacter baumannii (130). the hospitals provided epidemiological data on these microorganisms. sensitivity was determined by the broth microdilution method. results: the number of highly penicillin-resistant pneumococci fell significantly (p < 0.0001) compared with the previous study (from 59.8% to 30.2%). global methicillin-resistance in s. aureus was 31.2%, which represents a significant increase (p < 0.001) compared with the year 2001 (24.8%). 11.3% of the e. coli strains were extended-spectrum beta -lactamase-producers and came from 24 hospitals. one p. aeruginosa isolate gave a positive result in the e-test mbl assay, suggesting the presence of metallo-beta -lactamases. the strains of imipenem-resistant a. baumannii presented cross-resistance with several antibiotics. conclusion: these results show how the multi-resistant bacteria included in the study represent a growing problem in our hospitals. this emphasizes the importance of resistance surveillance systems and the correct use  of antimicrobial agents.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of ozonated water on bacteria invading dentinal tubules.
AB  == ozone is known to act as a strong antimicrobial agent against bacteria, fungi, and viruses. in the present study, we examined the effect of ozonated water against enterococcus faecalis and streptcoccus mutans infections in vitro in bovine dentin. after irrigation with ozonated water, the viability of e. faecalis and s. mutans invading dentinal tubules significantly decreased. notably, when the specimen was irrigated with sonication, ozonated water had nearly the same antimicrobial activity as 2.5% sodium hypochlorite (naocl). we also compared the  cytotoxicity against l-929 mouse fibroblasts between ozonated water and naocl. the metabolic activity of fibroblasts was high when the cells were treated with ozonated water, whereas that of fibroblasts significantly decreased when the cells were treated with 2.5% naocl. these results suggest that ozonated water application may be useful for endodontic therapy.

TI  == inhibition of antibiotic efflux in bacteria by the novel multidrug resistance inhibitors biricodar (vx-710) and timcodar (vx-853).
AB  == inhibitors of mammalian multidrug efflux, such as the plant alkaloid reserpine, are also active in potentiating antibiotic activity by inhibiting bacterial efflux. based on this precedent, two novel mammalian multiple drug resistance inhibitors, biricodar (vx-710) and timcodar (vx-853), were evaluated for activity in a variety of bacteria. both vx-710 and vx-853 potentiated the activity of ethidium bromide (etbr), a model efflux substrate, against three clinically significant gram-positive pathogens: staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae. similar to reserpine, vx-710 and vx-853 directly blocked etbr efflux in s. aureus. furthermore, these compounds were effective in lowering the mics of several clinically used antibiotics, including  fluoroquinolones, suggesting that vx-710 and vx-853 are representatives of a new  class of bacterial efflux inhibitors with the potential for use in combination therapy.

TI  == alkali-resistant bacteria in root canal systems.
AB  == the aim of this study was to isolate and identify alkali-resistant bacteria from  the dentin of infected root canals. bacteria from homogenized dentin powder made  up from infected root canal walls from human teeth were cultured on buffer-enriched brain heart infusion agar supplemented with 4% sheep blood (bhi-blood agar), adjusted to ph 7.0, 9.0 or 10.0. incubation took place for 7 days at 37 degrees c in an anaerobic glove box. bacterial strains selected according to colony and morphology were subcultured in buffer-enriched bhi broth  adjusted to ph 9.0, 10.0 or 11.0 to confirm their growth as alkali-resistant bacteria. polymerase chain reaction amplification using specific primer sets and  16s rdna sequence analysis was performed for identification of alkali-resistant isolates. in the present study, 37 teeth extracted from 37 patients were used for preparation of the dentin powder samples. bacteria were detected in 25 samples when standard bhi-blood agars (ph 7.0) were used. of these, 29 strains from 15 samples were alkali resistant, 25 strains growing at ph 9.0 and 4 at ph 10.0. the alkali-resistant strains included enterococcus faecium (10 strains) and enterococcus faecalis (2 strains), enterobacter cancerogenus (1 strains), fusobacterium nucleatum (1 strains), klebsiella ornithinolytica (2 strains), lactobacillus rhamnosus (2 strains), streptococcus anginosus (2 strains), streptococcus constellatus (3 strains), and streptococcus mitis (2 strains). three strains were also identified as bacteria of genus firmicutes or staphylococcus at the genus level. the present study showed that many bacterial species in infected root canal dentin were alkali-resistant at ph 9.0 and/or ph 10.0, and belonged mainly to the genus enterococcus.

TI  == review of 65 cases of infective endocarditis in dunedin public hospital.
AB  == background and aim: infective endocarditis remains a challenging disease to manage. the objective of this study was to evaluate the management of patients diagnosed with infective endocarditis presenting to a regional hospital. methods: during the years 1997 to 2002, 65 episodes of bacterial endocarditis in 62 patients (20 female, 42 male; age range from 7-89 yrs, median 68 yrs) classified  as definite or possible according to the duke criteria were reviewed retrospectively. the demographic data, predisposing factors, echocardiographic findings, culture results, complications and mortality were recorded and analysed. results: forty-five episodes (69%) were definite endocarditis and 20 episodes (31%) were possible endocarditis. all cases had undergone transthoracic  or transoesophageal echocardiograms with vegetations found in 59 (91%) episodes.  there were 49 cases of native valve endocarditis, 21 (34%) of whom had either congenital or acquired valvular disease. fifteen cases (23%) were prosthetic valve endocarditis. one case was automated implantable cardioverter defibrillator leads endocarditis. preceding dental or surgical manipulation was observed in 7 cases (11%). aortic valve (38/59, 64%) was the most common valve involved followed by mitral valve (21/59, 36%). staphylococcus aureus accounted for 20 episodes (31%), streptococcus viridans for 16 episodes (25%), enterococcus faecalis for 5 episodes (8%), other organisms for 9 episodes (14%), and culture negative endocarditis (cne) for 15 episodes (23%). the majority of the cases had  single valve involvement (50/59, 85%); only 9 cases (15%) were double valve endocarditis. ten cases (15%) needed urgent valve replacement. the overall in-hospital mortality rate was 20% (13/65), and at 6 months was 31% (20/65). higher 6-month mortality was seen in patients with staphylococcus aureus endocarditis or cne. conclusions: despite major advances in diagnostic technology, improvement in antimicrobial selection and monitoring, and progress in surgical techniques, the morbidity and mortality of bacterial endocarditis remain high.

TI  == use of simulated blood cultures for antibiotic effect on time to detection of the two blood culture systems bact/alert and bactec 9240.
AB  == to avoid the influence of pre-analytical steps, this study was performed using sterile blood spiked with defined loads of microorganisms as inoculum. time-to-detection (ttd) was evaluated for the most frequently encountered bacteria comparing two commercially available blood culture systems, bd bactec 9240 (becton dickinson) and bact/alert (organon teknika). the effect of the most  widely used antibiotics on ttd was evaluated on both systems. ttd was measured with antibiotics at their trough and at increasing concentrations. the results show that the bactec plus system recovers more pathogens with shorter time to detection than the bact/alert fan system when beta-lactam antibiotics (ampicillin, cefotaxime) are present at their respective trough concentration corresponding to parenteral therapy. the two systems seem to be equally efficient when gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole are used; in the case of vancomycin, bactec seems more effective than bact/alert.

TI  == tissue-specific adherent enterococcus faecalis strains that show highly efficient adhesion to human bladder carcinoma t24 cells also adhere to extracellular matrix proteins.
AB  == the ability of enterococcus faecalis clinical isolates to adhere to immobilized extracellular matrixes (ecms) coating the walls of microtiter plates was examined by microscopy. the ecms consisted of fibronectin, laminin, collagen types i, ii,  iv, and v, fibrinogen, and lactoferrin. with the exception of fibrinogen, each isolate showed a different level of adherence to each of the ecms. no significant level of adherence to fibrinogen was observed for any isolate. the tissue-specific adhesive strains as11, as12, as14, as15, ht11, and ht12, which showed highly efficient adherence to human bladder carcinoma t24 cells and human  bladder epithelial cells, showed strong adherence to fibronectin, laminin, and collagen type i, ii, iv, and v ecms, and the levels were greater than 10(4) cells/mm2 of well surface coated by ecm. none of the isolates that showed little  adherence to human bladder carcinoma t24 cells showed efficient adherence to all  the ecms. the levels of adherence of gelatinase-producing isolates to the collagens were lower than the levels of adherence of gelatinase-negative isolates. when tissue-specific adhesive strains that adhered strongly to each ecm were preincubated with fibronectin, the adherence of the strains to fibronectin was inhibited, but the adherence of the strains to collagen type iv was not inhibited. likewise, preincubation with collagen type iv inhibited adherence to collagen type iv but not adherence to fibronectin. all of the e. faecalis isolates were shown to carry the ace gene by pcr analysis performed with specific primers for collagen binding domain a of ace. the ace gene encodes ace (adhesin of collagen from enterococci). the prtf gene of group a streptococci, which encodes the fibronectin binding protein of group a streptococci, was not detected in the tissue-specific adhesive strains by southern analysis performed with the prtf probe of the streptococcus pyogenes jrs4 strain. mutants with altered collagen binding were isolated by insertion of tn916 into the chromosome of tissue-specific adhesive strain as14. the number of mutant adhesive bacterial cells that adhered to collagen and also to laminin was 1 or 2 orders lower than the number observed for the wild-type strain, but the level of adherence to fibronectin remained the same as that of the wild-type strain.

TI  == gram-positive mera gene in gram-negative oral and urine bacteria.
AB  == clinical mercury resistant (hg(r)) gram-negative bacteria carrying gram-positive  mercury reductase (mera)-like genes were characterized using dna-dna hybridization, pcr and sequencing. a pcr assay was developed which discriminated  between the mera genes related to staphylococcus and those related to the bacillus/streptococcus mera genes by the difference in size of the pcr product. dna sequence analysis correlated with the pcr assay. the mera genes from acinetobacter junii, enterobacter cloacae and escherichia coli were sequenced and shared 98-99% identical nucleotide (nt) and 99.6-100% amino acid identity with the staphylococcus aureus mera protein. a fourth mera gene, from pantoeae agglomerans, was partially sequenced (60%) and had 99% identical nt and 100% amino acid identity with the streptococcus oralis mera protein. all the hg(r) gram-negative bacteria transferred their gram-positive mera genes to a gram-positive enterococcus faecalis recipient with the resulting transconjugants  expressing mercury resistance. these gram-positive mera genes join gram-positive  tetracycline resistance and gram-positive macrolide resistance genes in their association with mobile elements which are able to transfer and express in gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == an in-vitro investigation of the antibacterial effect of nisin in root canals and canal wall radicular dentine.
AB  == aim: to determine whether nisin, a bacteriocin, would be effective at killing enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus gordonii cells in solution and within the root canal system. methodology: bacterial isolates of e. faecalis and s. gordonii were grown from glycerol stocks in closed tubes containing bhy broth at 37 degrees c. the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of nisin for both bacterial species was determined by a microdilution method. extracted human teeth were decoronated to produce roots of equal length with a single canal and divided into six groups of 10 roots. the canals were prepared to a master apical size 30  file using 0.04 taper ni-ti rotary instruments. bacterial samples of each species were inoculated into three groups of prepared roots and incubated in closed tubes at 37 degrees c for 21 days. the root canals in each group were then medicated with water (control), calcium hydroxide powder mixed with sterile water [ca(oh)2], or nisin and incubated for a further 7 days. rotary ni-ti files were used to take radicular dentine samples from the walls of each canal which were then incubated in bhy broth for 24 h. optical density (od600) readings were taken as a measure of bacterial growth. results: the mbc of nisin for e. faecalis and s. gordonii was 70 and 20 mg ml(-1) respectively. calcium hydroxide and nisin medication eradicated infection within the root canal while cells remained viable in the control group. mean optical density (od600) readings from canal wall dentine shavings infected with e. faecalis were 1.32 +/- 0.98, 0.73 +/- 0.27 and  0.69 +/- 0.38 for the control, ca(oh)2 and nisin samples respectively. corresponding mean readings for s. gordonii were 1.19 +/- 0.18, 0.73 +/- 0.15 and 0.60 +/- 0.29. the ca(oh)2 and nisin group readings were significantly (p < 0.01) lower than the control for each species as tested by student's t-test and mann-whitney u statistical analysis. values for ca(oh)2 and nisin were not significantly (p > 0.01) different. conclusion: nisin was effective at eradicating e. faecalis and s. gordonii cells in pure culture and was comparable  with ca(oh)2 in the elimination of these species from within the root canal system.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of five root canal sealers.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to analyze the antimicrobial properties of five  endodontic sealers: endo fill, endomethasone, endomethasone n, sealer 26 and ah-plus, against the following microorganisms: candida albicans, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis and actinomyces naeslundii.  the sealers were tested immediately, 24 h, 48 h and 7 days after manipulation.the direct contact method through the observation of the microbial growth in liquid medium and the agar diffusion test were used to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of the sealers. the results, in both methodologies used, showed that immediately after manipulation, endo-fill and endomethasone demonstrated the highest antimicrobial activity, with no statistically significant difference between them. sealer 26 demonstrated the lowest antimicrobial activity. at all other times after manipulation, there were no statistically significant differences among all the sealers tested. in conclusion, none of the sealers totally inhibited the growth of the microorganisms. furthermore, the antimicrobial activity of each sealer decreased with time and was dependent upon  the microbial susceptibility to them.

TI  == sensitivity of the bact/alert fa-medium for detection of pseudomonas aeruginosa in pre-incubated blood cultures and its temperature-dependence.
AB  == the bact/alert fa-medium was evaluated to detect pseudomonas aeruginosa in pre-incubated blood samples. as published previously its predecessor the bact/alert fan-medium failed to detect p. aeruginosa in delayed entry samples. it is now reported that fa-medium tolerates a longer pre-incubation period at 36 degrees c, i.e. 8 h, before detection of p. aeruginosa fails in experimentally inoculated blood cultures. in clinical blood samples the frequency of false-negative results concerning p. aeruginosa was reduced from 46.9 % (fan-medium) to 9.1 % (fa-medium). if media inoculated with p. aeruginosa are pre-incubated at room temperature for 24 h, false-negative results are not observed. various micro-organisms (haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, candida glabrata) were recognized after pre-incubation at room temperature with similar sensitivity compared to pre-incubation at 36 degrees c. it is concluded that fa-medium detects p. aeruginosa in delayed entry samples with increased sensitivity and pre-incubation at room temperature is superior to pre-incubation  at 36 degrees c.

TI  == retrieving sequences of enzymes experimentally characterized but erroneously annotated : the case of the putrescine carbamoyltransferase.
AB  == background: annotating genomes remains an hazardous task. mistakes or gaps in such a complex process may occur when relevant knowledge is ignored, whether lost, forgotten or overlooked. this paper exemplifies an approach which could help to resuscitate such meaningful data. results: we show that a set of closely  related sequences which have been annotated as ornithine carbamoyltransferases are actually putrescine carbamoyltransferases. this demonstration is based on the following points : (i) use of enzymatic data which had been overlooked, (ii) rediscovery of a short nh2-terminal sequence allowing to reannotate a wrongly annotated ornithine carbamoyltransferase as a putrescine carbamoyltransferase, (iii) identification of conserved motifs allowing to distinguish unambiguously between the two kinds of carbamoyltransferases, and (iv) comparative study of the gene context of these different sequences. conclusions: we explain why this specific case of misannotation had not yet been described and draw attention to the fact that analogous instances must be rather frequent. we urge to be especially cautious when high sequence similarity is coupled with an apparent lack of biochemical information. moreover, from the point of view of genome annotation, proteins which have been studied experimentally but are not correlated with sequence data in current databases qualify as "orphans", just as  unassigned genomic open reading frames do. the strategy we used in this paper to  bridge such gaps in knowledge could work whenever it is possible to collect a body of facts about experimental data, homology, unnoticed sequence data, and accurate informations about gene context.

TI  == emerging resistance among bacterial pathogens in the intensive care unit--a european and north american surveillance study (2000-2002).
AB  == background: globally icus are encountering emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant pathogens and for some pathogens there are few therapeutic options available. methods: antibiotic in vitro susceptibility data of predominant icu pathogens during 2000-2 were analyzed using data from the surveillance network (tsn) databases in europe (france, germany and italy), canada, and the united states (us). results: oxacillin resistance rates among staphylococcus aureus isolates ranged from 19.7% to 59.4%. penicillin resistance  rates among streptococcus pneumoniae varied from 2.0% in germany to as high as 20.2% in the us; however, ceftriaxone resistance rates were comparably lower, ranging from 0% in germany to 3.4% in italy. vancomycin resistance rates among enterococcus faecalis were < or = 4.5%; however, among enterococcus faecium vancomycin resistance rates were more frequent ranging from 0.8% in france to 76.3% in the united states. putative rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production among enterobacteriaceae were low, <6% among escherichia coli in the five countries studied. ceftriaxone resistance rates were generally lower  than or similar to piperacillin-tazobactam for most of the enterobacteriaceae species examined. fluoroquinolone resistance rates were generally higher for e. coli (6.5% - 13.9%), proteus mirabilis (0-34.7%), and morganella morganii (1.6-20.7%) than other enterobacteriaceae spp (1.5-21.3%). p. aeruginosa demonstrated marked variation in beta-lactam resistance rates among countries. imipenem was the most active compound tested against acinetobacter spp., based on resistance rates. conclusion: there was a wide distribution in resistance patterns among the five countries. compared with other countries, italy showed the highest resistance rates to all the organisms with the exception of enterococcus spp., which were highest in the us. this data highlights the differences in resistance encountered in intensive care units in europe and north america and the need to determine current local resistance patterns by which to guide empiric antimicrobial therapy for intensive care infections.

TI  == pharmacodynamics of telavancin (td-6424), a novel bactericidal agent, against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == telavancin (td-6424) is a novel lipoglycopeptide that produces rapid and concentration-dependent killing of clinically relevant gram-positive organisms in vitro. the present studies evaluated the in vivo pharmacodynamics of telavancin in the mouse neutropenic thigh (mnt) and mouse subcutaneous infection (msi) animal models. pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic studies in the mnt model demonstrated that the 24-h area under the concentration-time curve (auc)/mic ratio was the best predictor of efficacy. telavancin produced dose-dependent reduction of thigh titers of several organisms, including methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), penicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis. the 50% effective dose (ed50) estimates for telavancin ranged from 0.5 to 6.6 mg/kg of body weight  (administered intravenously), and titers were reduced by up to 3 log10 cfu/g from pretreatment values. against mrsa atcc 33591, telavancin was 4- and 30-fold more  potent (on an ed50 basis) than vancomycin and linezolid, respectively. against mssa atcc 13709, telavancin was 16- and 40-fold more potent than vancomycin and nafcillin, respectively. telavancin, vancomycin, and linezolid were all efficacious and more potent against mrsa atcc 33591 in the msi model compared to  the mnt model. this deviation in potency was, however, disproportionately greater for vancomycin and linezolid than for telavancin, suggesting that activity of telavancin is less affected by the immune status. the findings of these studies collectively suggest that once-daily dosing of telavancin may provide an effective approach for the treatment of clinically relevant infections with gram-positive organisms.

TI  == evaluation of the hyplex bloodscreen multiplex pcr-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system for direct identification of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli from positive blood cultures.
AB  == we evaluated the hyplex bloodscreen pcr-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) system (bag, lich, germany), a new diagnostic test for the direct identification  of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci from positive blood cultures, with 482 positive bactec 9240 blood culture bottles. the test involves amplification of the bacterial dna by multiplex pcr and subsequent hybridization  of the pcr product to specific oligonucleotide probes in an elisa-based format. the available probes allow the separate detection of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella spp., staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus pneumoniae and the staphylococcal meca  gene. the hyplex bloodscreen test showed an overall sensitivity of 100% for the identification of gram-negative bacilli and 96.6 to 100% for the identification of gram-positive cocci (s. aureus, 100%; s. epidermidis, 97.2%; enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus faecium, 96.6%; and streptococcus pneumoniae, 100%). the specificities of the test modules ranged from 92.5 to 100% for gram-negative bacilli and 97.7 to 100% for gram-positive cocci (escherichia coli, 92.5%; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 98.5%; klebsiella spp., 100%; enterobacter aerogenes, 100%; s. aureus, 100%, s. epidermidis, 97.7%; enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus  faecium, 99.6%; streptococcus pyogenes, 100%; and streptococcus pneumoniae, 99.3%). the result of the meca gene detection module correlated with the result of the phenotypic oxacillin resistance testing in all 38 isolates of staphylococcus aureus investigated. in conclusion, the hyplex bloodscreen pcr-elisa system is well suited for the direct and specific identification of the most common pathogenic bacteria and the direct detection of the meca gene of staphylococcus aureus in positive blood cultures.

TI  == impact of susceptibility to antibiotics of streptococci & enterococci isolated from patients with infective endocarditis on antibiotic treatment.
AB  == background & objectives: streptococci and enterococci are the most frequent pathogens causing infective endocarditis. in order to update the recommendations  for both curative and prophylaxis treatment, the susceptibility to antibiotics of the most prevalent species of streptococcaceae isolated from the patients with infective endocarditis was determined. methods: streptococcal and enterococcal isolates (n=133) isolated from confirmed cases of infective endocarditis during a one-year prospective survey conducted in 1999 in france were studied. the identification of 106 streptococci and 27 enterococci to the species level was carried out by conventional methods. their susceptibility to ten antibiotics used in curative or prophylactic treatment was measured. minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined by agar dilution method. results: all the streptococcal and enterococcal isolates were susceptible to 4 mg/l or less of penicillin or amoxicillin. high levels of resistance to aminoglycosides were observed in two species, streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus and enterococcus faecalis. all isolates were susceptible to glycopeptides. resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin, and pristinamycin was restricted to some species. interpretation & conclusion: curative treatments recommended for streptococcal or enterococcal endocarditis, including penicillin, amoxicillin or vancomycin in association with gentamicin were found to be appropriate for 98.5 per cent of cases. the emergence of erythromycin resistance in oral streptococci led to the use of pristinamycin in oral prophylactic treatment in patients allergic to beta-lactams.

TI  == [streptococcus salivarius meningitis after spinal anesthesia].
AB  == streptococcus salivarius is a usual commensal of skin, gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary tract, oral cavity and paranasal sinuses. although it is usually considered to have low virulence, s. salivarius may cause life-threatening infections, particularly endocarditis. on the other hand, bacterial meningitis after spinal anesthesia is very rare, there being some reported cases caused by s. salivarius, s. mitis, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis. we report a 57 year old man who developed meningitis symptoms within 10 h of an uncomplicated inguinal herniorrhaphy performed during spinal anesthesia. cerebrospinal cultures grew s. salivarius sensitive to penicillin. the patient was successfully treated with penicillin g and left the hospital without sequelae. in the literature, bacterial meningitis due to s. salivarius is rarely  reported. of the 28 cases, 18 occurred after lumbar puncture for diagnostic or for spinal anesthesia, 5 occurred following a bacteriemia for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy or intestinal neoplasia, and the other 5 in patients who had dural defects. we discuss the possible etiological causes of the meningitis due to s. salivarius cases reports. the early recognition of this entity and the aseptic precautions likely to reduce the incidence of infectious complications after lumbar puncture are stressed.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from aoc salers cheese.
AB  == the objective of this work was to describe the diversity of lactic acid bacteria  in traditional raw milk salers cheeses at the species and strain levels. the characterization of 381 strains isolated during ripening and various strain collections was investigated using physiological analysis and molecular techniques: rep-pcr, species and genus specific amplifications and the sequence analysis of 16s rdna for strain typing and taxonomic identification. the strains  belonged to lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garviae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus millieri, streptococcus macedonicus and pediococcus pentosaceus. a  wide phenotypic and genomic heterogeneity was observed within the different species (lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei and leuconostoc mesenteroides) according to the origin and the time of ripening. the natural microflora was different from strain collection and each method must be combined  to identify and characterize natural microflora. this study revealed the low selectivity of selective media used for the isolation of different groups of lactic acid bacteria except the facultatively heterofermentative lactobacilli medium selecting mesophile lactobacilli and sb medium selective for enterococcus. the study reveals, for the first time, the microbial lactic acid bacteria community of salers cheese and its diversity. a better knowledge of microbial flora will be useful to improve understanding of sensory quality of cheeses.

TI  == in vitro modeling of dental water line contamination and decontamination.
AB  == the contamination of dental unit water lines (duwl) is an emerging concern in dentistry. the aim of this study was to use an in vitro duwl to model microbial contamination and evaluate the decontamination efficacy of tetraacetylethylenediamine (taed) solutions. a duwl biofilm model used to simulate clinical conditions was used to generate a range of biofilms in duwl. three distinct biofilms were generated: (1) biofilm from water, (2) biofilm from  a mix of water + contaminating human commensal bacteria, (3) biofilm from water with contaminating oral bacteria added after biofilm formed. the contaminating oral species used were streptococcus oralis, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus. decontamination by simple water flushing or flushing with  taed was evaluated (2, 5 and 10 min intervals). the duwl tubes were split and samples were plated onto a range of media, incubated and bacteria enumerated. water flushing did not reduce the number of microorganisms detected. bacteria were not detected from any of the taed sampling points for any of the biofilm types tested. interestingly, if contamination was introduced to new duwl along with the waterborne species a biofilm was formed containing only the waterborne species. if however, an existing biofilm was present before the introduction of "contaminating" bacteria then these could be detected in the biofilm. this implies that if the duwl are new or satisfactorily cleaned on a regular basis then the associated cross-contamination aspects are reduced. in conclusion, taed  provides effective control for duwl biofilms.

AB  == sixty-seven crude ethanol extracts from 50 plants (31 families), which are used in north cote-d'ivoire as traditional remedies for bacterial diseases, were screened for in vitro activity against gram negative (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) and gram positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes and bacillus subtilis) bacteria. thirty-one extracts showed antibacterial activity only on gram positive bacteria. of these,  10 extracts from 10 plant species had a promising level of activity against bacteria including strains resistant to antibiotics such as aminosides, penicillin m, macrolides, lincosamide and streptrogramin b. the most active was erythrina senegalensis dc (fabaceae) followed by bobgunnia madagascariensis (desv.) j.h. kirkbr. & wiersema (caesalpinaceae), waltheria lanceolata r. br. ex  mast. (sterculiaceae), uapaca togoensis pax. (euphorbiaceae), ximenia americana l. (olacaceae), khaya senegalensis (ders.) a. juss. (meliaceae), lannea acida a.  rich. (anacardiaceae), cissus populnea guill. & perr. (vitaceae), keetia hispida  (benth.) bridson (rubiaceae) and ficus thonningii (miq.) a. rich. (moraceae). this is the first report of the antibacterial potency of these 10 plant species on a range of bacteria. the results provided evidence that some of the studied plants might indeed be potential sources of new antibacterial agents, also against some antibiotic-resistant strains.

TI  == prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from blood cultures of hospitalized patients in the united states in 2002.
AB  == background: bloodstream infections are associated with significant patient morbidity and mortality. antimicrobial susceptibility patterns should guide the choice of empiric antimicrobial regimens for patients with bacteremia. methods: from january to december of 2002, 82,569 bacterial blood culture isolates were reported to the surveillance network (tsn) database-usa by 268 laboratories. susceptibility to relevant antibiotic compounds was analyzed using national committee for clinical laboratory standards guidelines. results: coagulase-negative staphylococci (42.0%), staphylococcus aureus (16.5%), enterococcus faecalis (8.3%), escherichia coli (7.2%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3.6%), and enterococcus faecium (3.5%) were the most frequently isolated bacteria from blood cultures, collectively accounting for >80% of isolates. in vitro susceptibility to expanded-spectrum beta-lactams such as ceftriaxone were high for oxacillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (98.7%), oxacillin-susceptible s. aureus (99.8%), e. coli (97.3%), k. pneumoniae (93.3%),  and streptococcus pneumoniae (97.2%). susceptibilities to fluoroquinolones were variable for k. pneumoniae (90.3-91.4%), e. coli (86.0-86.7%), oxacillin-susceptible s. aureus (84.0-89.4%), oxacillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (72.7-82.7%), e. faecalis (52.1%), and e. faecium (11.3%). combinations of antimicrobials are often prescribed as empiric therapy for bacteremia. susceptibilities of all blood culture isolates to one or  both agents in combinations of ceftriaxone, ceftazdime, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam or ciprofloxacin plus gentamicin were consistent (range,  74.8-76.3%) but lower than similar beta-lactam or ciprofloxacin combinations with vancomycin (range, 93.5-96.6%). conclusion: ongoing surveillance for antimicrobial susceptibility remains essential, and will enhance efforts to identify resistance and attempt to limit its spread.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to compare bacterial leakage using streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis through gutta-percha and a thermoplastic synthetic polymer-based root filling (resilon) using two filling techniques during a 30-day period. teeth were decoronated, roots prepared to a length of 16  mm, and instrumented to iso sizes 40 to 50. a total of 156 roots were randomly divided into 8 groups of 15 roots (groups 1-8) and 3 control groups (12 roots each). roots were filled using lateral and vertical condensation techniques with  gutta-percha and ah 26 sealer (groups 1 and 2) or with gutta-percha and epiphany  sealer (groups 3 and 4). groups 5 and 6 were filled with resilon and epiphany sealer using the lateral or vertical condensation techniques. a split chamber microbial leakage model was used in which s. mutans placed in the upper chamber could reach the lower chamber only through the filled canal. groups 7 and 8 were  identical to groups 5 and 6 respectively; however, e. faecalis was used to test the leakage. positive controls were filled with resilon (12 roots) and gutta-percha (12 roots) without sealer and tested with bacteria, whereas negative controls (12 roots) were sealed with wax to test the seal between chambers. all but one positive control leaked within 24 h, whereas none of the negative controls leaked. resilon showed minimal leakage (group 8: one leakage; groups 5-7: each with two leakages), which was significantly less than gutta-percha, in  which approximately 80% of specimens with either technique or sealer leaked. kruskal-wallis test showed statistical significance when all groups were compared (p < 0.05). mann-whitney u test compared the respective groups and found resilon  groups superior to gutta-percha groups (p < 0.05).

AB  == we developed real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays for rapid detection of the most common and clinically relevant bacteria in positive blood culture bottles, including staphylococcus spp., s. epidermidis, s. aureus, enterococcus spp. (including differentiation of e. faecalis and e. faecium), streptococcus spp., streptococcus agalactiae, enterobacteriaceae, e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter spp., bacteroides spp., haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. a total of 507 positive blood cultures were investigated according to a specific pcr algorithm based on the microscopic result of the blood culture, and the pcr results were compared to the culture results. apart from-cross reactions between e. coli and chryseomonas luteola and enterococcus faecium and e. durans, the pcr assay correctly identified all bacteria in the blood cultures and did not show any false-positive results. regarding blood cultures positive with a single species of bacteria (n = 474), 98.3% of all bacteria were correctly detected by the pcr algorithm within a few hours. however, in mixed infections, the sensitivity was lower. the pcr algorithm is well suited for rapid identification of the most common bacteria in  positive blood cultures.

TI  == comparative study of the in vitro activity of a new fluoroquinolone, abt-492.
AB  == objectives: the in vitro activity of a new fluoroquinolone, abt-492, was determined. methods: mics were compared with those of two beta-lactams, telithromycin, ciprofloxacin and four later generation fluoroquinolones. the effects of human serum and of inoculum concentration were also investigated. results: mic data indicate that abt-492 has potent activity against gram-positive organisms with enhanced anti-staphylococcal activity compared with earlier fluoroquinolones, in addition to activity against beta-haemolytic streptococci, pneumococci including penicillin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains and vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant enterococcus faecalis but not enterococcus  faecium. abt-492 was the most active agent tested against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria meningitidis, fluoroquinolone-susceptible neisseria gonorrhoeae and anaerobes. good activity was observed for abt-492 amongst the enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes tested, but ciprofloxacin showed superior activity for species of proteus, morganella and providencia, as well as  for pseudomonas spp. in common with the other fluoroquinolones tested, organisms  with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin had raised mic(90)s to abt-492. the  one isolate of h. influenzae tested with reduced fluoroquinolone susceptibility had an abt-492 mic close to that of the population lacking a mechanism of quinolone resistance. abt-492 was more active than ciprofloxacin against chlamydia spp. an inoculum effect was observed with a number of isolates of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, e. faecium, klebsiella spp. and  escherichia coli, in addition to moderately raised mics in the presence of 70% serum protein. the clinical significance of these findings is yet to be determined. conclusions: abt-492 is a new fluoroquinolone with excellent activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, with many potential clinical uses.

TI  == potential utility of a peptide deformylase inhibitor (nvp pdf-713) against oxazolidinone-resistant or streptogramin-resistant gram-positive organism isolates.
AB  == objectives: to evaluate the potency of a novel peptide deformylase inhibitor, nvp pdf-713, against gram-positive organisms having resistances to linezolid or quinupristin/dalfopristin. materials and methods: a total of 45 strains from three genera (six species groups) were tested by reference broth microdilution methods. the mechanism of resistance to the oxazolidinone was determined by sequencing of the gene encoding the ribosomal target. results: nvp pdf-713 retained activity against linezolid-resistant staphylococci (mic range 0.25-2 mg/l), streptococcus oralis (mic 0.5 mg/l), enterococcus faecalis (mic range 2-4  mg/l) and enterococcus faecium (mic range 0.5-4 mg/l). quinupristin/dalfopristin-resistant e. faecium (mic range 1-2 mg/l) and staphylococci (mic range 0.12-2 mg/l) were also inhibited by nvp pdf-713. many (10 of 13 strains) of the linezolid-resistant enterococci were resistant to vancomycin and these clinical strains had a g2576u ribosomal target mutation. conclusions: nvp pdf-713 appears to be a promising clinical candidate among the peptide deformylase inhibitors for the treatment of infections caused by gram-positive organisms that possess resistances to oxazolidinones or streptogramin combinations.

TI  == activity of linezolid against gram-positive cocci isolated in french hospitals as determined by three in-vitro susceptibility testing methods.
AB  == in total, 844 strains of gram-positive cocci were collected from six university hospitals in france between september 1999 and january 2000. mics of linezolid were determined: (i) for all strains by agar dilution (method a); (ii) by broth microdilution (method b) for staphylococci and enterococci; (iii) by etest (method e) for beta-haemolytic streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae. susceptibility to other antibiotics was determined by the disk diffusion method.  mic50 and mic90 values were identical (2 mg/l) for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (n = 179) by methods a and b. linezolid was active against  methicillin-resistant s. aureus (n = 117), with an mic90 of 2 mg/l (methods a and b), but with a lower mic50 of 1 mg/l by method a. of the 200 coagulase-negative staphylococci, 56.5% were methicillin-resistant and 43.5% were methicillin-susceptible. linezolid had similar in-vitro activity by methods a and b (mic50 and mic90 values of 1-2 mg/l), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility. the mic90 of linezolid for all enterococci (150 enterococcus faecalis and 50 enterococcus faecium) was 2 mg/l by both methods. mics of linezolid for beta-haemolytic streptococci had a narrow range of 0.5-2 mg/l (method a) and 0.125-2 mg/l (method e). pneumococci (n = 118), including 67 penicillin g-intermediate and -resistant strains, were all inhibited by linezolid 2 mg/l (mic90 of 2 mg/l by methods a and e). no strain had an mic of > 2 mg/l by  agar dilution or etest, or of > 4 mg/l by broth microdilution. overall, the study confirmed the good in-vitro activity of linezolid and the very narrow range of mics for gram-positive cocci susceptible or resistant to other antibiotics, irrespective of the method used.

TI  == [nationwide sensitivity surveillance of ciprofloxacin and various parenteral antibiotics against bacteria isolated from patients with severe infections--the first ciproxan iv special investigation in 2001].
AB  == the parenteral injection of ciprofloxacin (cpfx), a fluoroquinolone antimicrobial drug, was approved in september 2000 and a re-examination period of 6 years was set at that time. as a special investigation to apply for re-examination of this  drug, it has been planned to conduct 3 nationwide surveillances during the re-examination period by collecting clinically isolated bacteria from patients with severe infections, to whom the drug was mainly indicated, and examining drug susceptibilities of the bacteria to various parenteral antimicrobial drugs including cpfx. this time, we determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of various parenteral antimicrobial drugs including cpfx against 1,220 strains isolated from patients with severe infections by the micro-liquid dilution method and compared susceptibilities of various clinically isolated bacteria to cpfx with those to other antimicrobial drugs. gram-positive bacteria  were less susceptible to cpfx than to carbapenems except 2 bacterial species, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus avium but susceptibilities of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), staphylococcus epidermidis  and enterococcus faecalis to cpfx were comparable to those to cefozopran. susceptibility of streptococcus pneumoniae to cpfx did not differ among ampicillin (abpc)-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (mic of abpc: < 0.25 microgram/ml), abpc-intermediate s. pneumoniae (mic of abpc: 0.25-2 micrograms/ml) and abpc-resistant s. pneumoniae (mic of abpc: > or = 4 micrograms/ml) mic90 of cpfx: 1 microgram/ml) and a decrease in the antimicrobial activity seen among cephem and carbapenem antimicrobial drugs against penicillin-intermediate strains was not noted with cpfx. gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to cpfx similarly to carbapenems and the mic90 values of cpfx were in the range from < or = 0.063 to 2 micrograms/ml against strains except stenotrophomonas maltophilia and burkholderia cepacia. pseudomonas aeruginosa was most susceptible to cpfx among the antibacterial drugs examined and the mic90 was 2 micrograms/ml. cpfx also showed the lowest mic90 value (0.5 microgram/ml) against beta-lactam-resistant p. aeruginosa among the drugs examined. when extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production and class b beta-lactamase production were examined in 439 strains of enterobacteriaceae and 168 strains of  glucose non-fermentative bacteria out of the gram-negative bacteria collected this time, 3 strains (0.49%) producing esbl and 7 strains (1.15%) producing class b beta-lactamase were found. the mic range of cpfx to these 10 strains was between < or = 0.063 to 8 micrograms/ml and 5 strains among those showed susceptibilities (mic of cpfx: 1 microgram/ml) based on the nccls breakpoint. cpfx also showed a satisfactory result concerning susceptibilities of major causal bacteria based on the report of the committee of japan society of chemotherapy on the standard method for determination of susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, the breakpoint of pneumonia. furthermore, susceptibilities  of various bacteria isolated clinically from patients with severe infections this time did not differ much from the result of the nationwide surveillance which we  conducted in 1997. thus, it was concluded that the antimicrobial activity of cpfx was maintained in the post-marketing surveillance for its parenteral preparation.

TI  == controlled autolysis and enzyme release in a recombinant lactococcal strain expressing the metalloendopeptidase enterolysin a.
AB  == this study concerns the exploitation of the lytic enzyme enterolysin a (entl), produced by enterococcus faecalis strain dpc5280, to elicit the controlled autolysis of starter lactococci. entl, a cell wall metalloendopeptidase secreted  by some e. faecalis strains, can kill a wide range of gram-positive bacteria, including lactococci. the controlled expression of entl, which encodes entl, was  achieved using a nisin-inducible expression system in a lactococcal host. zymographic analysis of entl activity demonstrated that active enzyme is produced by the recombinant lactococcal host. indeed, expression of entl resulted in almost complete autolysis of the host strain 2 h after induction with nisin. model cheese experiments using a starter strain in addition to the inducible enterolysin-producing strain showed a 27-fold increase in activity with respect to the release of lactate dehydrogenase in the strain overexpressing entl, demonstrating the potential of entl production in large-scale cheese production systems. indeed, the observation that a wide range of lactic bacteria are sensitive to entl suggests that entl-induced autolysis has potential applications with a variety of lactic acid bacteria and could be a basis for probiotic delivery systems.

TI  == new antibacterial agents derived from the dna gyrase inhibitor cyclothialidine.
AB  == cyclothialidine (1, ro 09-1437) is a potent dna gyrase inhibitor that was isolated from streptomyces filipinensis nr0484 and is a member of a new family of natural products. it acts by competitively inhibiting the atpase activity exerted by the b subunit of dna gyrase but barely exhibits any growth inhibitory activity against intact bacterial cells, presumably due to insufficient permeation of the  cytoplasmic membrane. to explore the antibacterial potential of 1, we developed a flexible synthetic route allowing for the systematic modification of its structure. from a first set of analogues, structure-activity relationships (sar)  were established for different substitution patterns, and the 14-hydroxylated, bicyclic core (x) of 1 seemed to be the structural prerequisite for dna gyrase inhibitory activity. the variation of the lactone ring size, however, revealed that activity can be found among 11- to 16-membered lactones, and even seco-analogues were shown to maintain some enzyme inhibitory properties, thereby  reducing the minimal structural requirements to a rather simple, hydroxylated benzyl sulfide (xi). on the basis of these "minimal structures" a modification program afforded a number of inhibitors that showed in vitro activity against gram-positive bacteria. the best activities were displayed by 14-membered lactones, and representatives of this subclass exhibit excellent and broad in vitro antibacterial activity against gram-positive pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and enterococcus faecalis, and overcome resistance against clinically used drugs. by improving the pharmacokinetic properties of the most active compounds (94, 97), in particular by lowering their lipophilic properties, we were able to identify congeners of cyclothialidine (1) that showed efficacy in vivo.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin against ocular pathogens.
AB  == the ideal ophthalmic anti-infective exhibits broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and atypical bacterial species. these pathogens can cause potentially blinding infections such as keratitis and endophthalmitis, both of which are associated with ophthalmic surgery or traumatic injury. these infections often require aggressive antibacterial therapy, preferably with newer  generations of antibiotics. in this study, minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values for gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined in vitro against bacterial strains that were isolated from suspected cases of bacterial keratitis  and endophthalmitis. the ocular isolates included 7 gram-positive, 4 gram-negative, and 3 atypical bacterial species. gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin exhibited similar activity against 6 gram-positive organisms: staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis. mic90 values for the drugs  against these isolates ranged from 0.08 mg/ml to 0.57 mg/ml and were comparable to previously published values against isolates from patients with systemic infections. the mic90 for gatifloxacin against streptococcus viridans was 0.22 mg/ml compared with 0.73 mg/ml for moxifloxacin (p = .011). among the gram-negative isolates, the mean mic90 for gatifloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1.28 mg/ml compared with 2.60 mg/ ml for moxifloxacin (p = .023).  mic90 values for gatifloxacin against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes were one fourth to one fifth the values for moxifloxacin. for the atypicals, the mic90 values for gatifloxacin against nocardia asteroides and mycobacterium chelonae were one fourth the corresponding values for moxifloxacin. gatifloxacin demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against several key ocular pathogens tested in this study and was at least as effective as moxifloxacin against these pathogens.

TI  == cell density--dependent regulation: basic principles and effects on the virulence of gram-positive cocci.
AB  == principles: quorum sensing (qs) regulation appears to be a consequence of interbacterial communication by which bacteria of one or even different species learn about their current population density and react in a defined way to that information. qs-regulation is a three step process: in the first step specific signaling molecules are produced and secreted to the exterior space. in the second step, the molecules accumulate e.g. with growing population density. in the last step, a supra-threshold concentration of the molecules is extra- or intra-cellularly sensed by the bacteria and leads to a cascade of regulatory activities. while gram-negative bacteria can employ five or more different chemical classes of signaling molecules, gram-positive cocci predominantly use special oligopeptides for specific signaling. descriptions: examples of qs-regulatory effects on virulence factor expression in staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, and enterococcus faecalis are given. in these bacteria, qs-regulation appears to be crucial for displaying tissue invasiveness and/or biofilm formation. applications: the high specificity of the initial signal sensing and the importance for expressing special virulence traits make this type of gene expression control a promising target for the development of novel therapeutics. the options for such therapies are critically discussed based on practical experiences with interference in s. aureus qs-regulation.

AB  == the interactions between the phenothiazine dyes, methylene blue (mb) and toluidine blue (tb), and bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, hemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) were studied spectrophotometrically. this demonstrated that a metachromatic reaction took place between the dyes and bacteria. furthermore, bacteria induced additional dimerization of mb and tb. the effective dimerization constants of mb and tb were evaluated in the presence of each bacterial strain at a concentration of 10(8) cfu/ml. the analysis of the effective dimerization constants for mb and tb in the presence of bacteria indicated that the ability to form dimers was greater for tb than for mb. gram-negative bacteria induced the dye dimerization more intensely than gram-positive bacteria. there was a correlation between the ability of each dye to form dimers in the presence of bacteria and the relative photobactericidal efficacy of each dye against these bacteria. these results provide evidence confirming the essential role of the dye dimers in bacterial photodamage.

TI  == in vitro activities of the novel cephalosporin lb 11058 against multidrug-resistant staphylococci and streptococci.
AB  == lb 11058 is a novel parenteral cephalosporin with a c-3 pyrimidinyl-substituted vinyl sulfide group and a c-7 2-amino-5-chloro-1,3-thiazole group. this study evaluated the in vitro activity and spectrum of lb 11058 against 1,245 recent clinical isolates, including a subset of gram-positive strains with specific resistant phenotypes. lb 11058 was very active against streptococcus pneumoniae.  the novel cephalosporin was 8- to 16-fold more potent than ceftriaxone, cefepime, or amoxicillin-clavulanate against both penicillin-intermediate and -resistant s. pneumoniae. lb 11058 was also very active against both beta-hemolytic streptococci (mic at which 90% of isolates were inhibited [mic(90)], </=0.008 micro g/ml) and viridans group streptococci (mic(90), 0.03 to 0.5 micro g/ml), including penicillin-resistant strains. among oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, lb 11058 mic results varied from 0.06 to 0.25 micro g/ml (mic(50), 0.12 micro g/ml), while among oxacillin-resistant strains lb 11058 mics varied from 0.25 to 1 micro g/ml (mic(50), 1 micro g/ml). coagulase-negative staphylococci showed an lb 11058 susceptibility pattern similar to that of s. aureus, with all isolates being inhibited at </=1 micro g/ml. lb 11058 also showed reasonable in vitro activity against enterococcus faecalis, including vancomycin-resistant strains (mic(50), 1 micro g/ml), and bacillus spp. (mic(50), 0.25 micro g/ml); however, it was less active against enterococcus faecium (mic(50), >64 micro g/ml) and corynebacterium spp. (mic(50), 32 micro g/ml). against gram-negative pathogens, lb 11058 showed activity against haemophilus influenzae (mic(90), 0.25 to 0.5 micro g/ml) and moraxella catarrhalis (mic(90),  0.25 micro g/ml), with mics not influenced by beta-lactamase production. in conclusion, lb 11058 demonstrated a broad antibacterial spectrum and was highly active against gram-positive bacteria, particularly against multidrug-resistant staphylococci and streptococci.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--i. gram-positive bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. changes in the bacterial susceptibility for czop were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint mic. sixteen species (2,363 strains) of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the  clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis  (msse), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse), staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus saprophyticus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp), penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp), streptococcus milleri group and peptostreptococcus spp. the antibacterial activity of czop either against mssa or msse was preferable (mic90: 2 or 0.5 micrograms/ml) and comparable to those of other cephems. czop was also effective  on mrse (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) but not on mrsa. czop and other cephems had low antibacterial activity against s. haemolyticus (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than those of other cephems, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (32 vs 1-2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop  against e. faecalis was comparable to that of cefpirome (cpr; mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) and higher than those of other cephems. no antibacterial activity  of czop against e. faecium and e. avium was observed, like other drugs. the antibacterial activity of czop against s. pyogenes was as potent as those of cefotiam and cpr (mic90: < or = 0.063 microgram/ml), and, against s. agalactiae,  was also preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml). czop indicated preferable antibacterial activity either against pssp, pisp, or prsp (mic90: 0.25, 1, or 2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. milleri group was also preferable, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (4 vs 0.5 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than those of cefazolin and cefmetazole. the resistance ratio estimated from breakpoint mic of czop was 95.9% in mrsa, 93.5% in prsp, 63.3% in pisp, 35.8% in s. haemolyticus, 27.9% in e. faecalis, and 13.3% mrse. those resistance ratios were comparable to those for cefepime (cfpm), but e. faecalis showed 91.2% for cfpm. the difference in the resistance ratio of e. faecalis demonstrated that czop successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against these species. in correlation of drug susceptibility, 40.3% of prsp was not inhibited at breakpoint mic either czop or  cfpm while 69.2% at breakpoint mic either czop or ceftazidime. in conclusion, the antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria obtained from the 6-year duration study were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. a decline in the sensitivities of s. saprophyticus, s. milleri group, pisp, and prsp to czop, however, was suggested.

AB  == a survey was conducted to determine the antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones and other antimicrobial agents against 8,474 clinical isolates obtained from 37 japanese medical institutions in 2000. a total of 25 antimicrobial agents were used, comprising 4 fluoroquinolones, 13 beta-lactams, minocycline, chloramphenicol, clarithromycin, azithromycin, gentamicin, amikacin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and vancomycin. a high resistance rate of over 85% against fluoroquinolones was exhibited by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and enterococcus faecium. isolates showing resistance to fluoroquinolones among methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa from uti accounted for 30-60%.  however, many of the common pathogens were still susceptible to fluoroquinolones, such as streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin-resistant isolates), streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci, moraxella catarrhalis,  the enterobacteriaceae family, and haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant isolates). about 85% of p. aeruginosa isolated from rti were susceptible to fluoroquinolones. in conclusion, this survey of sensitivity to antimicrobial agents clearly indicated trend for increasing resistance to fluoroquinolones among mrsa, enterococci, and p. aeruginosa isolated from uti, although fluoroquinolones are still effective against other organisms and p. aeruginosa from rti as has been demonstrated in previous studies.

TI  == bactericidal activity and synergy studies of bal9141, a novel pyrrolidinone-3-ylidenemethyl cephem, tested against streptococci, enterococci and methicillin-resistant staphylococci.
AB  == bal9141 has been reported to have inhibitory activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), many enterococci, and streptococci with various resistant patterns. bal9141 potency was assessed by time-kill curves alone or with subinhibitory concentrations of gentamicin (mic/4). bal9141 exhibited bactericidal activity alone against all the streptococci and staphylococci. among ampicillin-susceptible enterococci, bal9141 was bactericidal against some strains, but no bal9141 inhibition was observed of  ampicillin-resistant enterococcus faecium. the activity of bal9141 with gentamicin was slightly enhanced (not synergy) or indifferent against staphylococci. bal9141 demonstrated bactericidal action alone against enterococcus faecalis and some e. faecium strains (-4.8 to -6.0 log10 cfu/ml), but static effects were also noted. drug interactions with gentamicin showed early synergy (4-8 h) for all enterococci, and indifference or synergy at 24 h (no antagonism). bal9141 (< or = 8 mg/l) showed promising bactericidal activity alone and synergy with gentamicin against some of the vancomycin-resistant enterococci tested.

TI  == molecular structure and evolution of the conjugative multiresistance plasmid pre25 of enterococcus faecalis isolated from a raw-fermented sausage.
AB  == plasmid pre25 from enterococcus faecalis transfers resistances against kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, lincomycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, tylosin, chloramphenicol, and nourseothricin sulfate by conjugation in vitro to e. faecalis jh2-2, lactococcus lactis bu2, and listeria innocua l19. its nucleotide sequence of 50237 base pairs represents the  largest, fully sequenced conjugative multiresistance plasmid of enterococci (plasmid 46 (2001) 170). the gene for chloramphenicol resistance (cat) was identified as an acetyltransferase identical to the one of plasmid pip501 of streptococcus agalactiae. erythromycin resistance is due to a 23s ribosomal rna methyl transferase, again as found in pip501 (ermb). the aminoglycoside resistance genes are packed in tandem as in transposon tn5405 of staphylococcus aureus: an aminoglycoside 6-adenyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyl transferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase.). identical resistance genes are known from pathogens like streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. aureus, campylobacter coli, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium difficile. pre25 is composed of a 30.5-kbp segment almost identical to pip501. of the 15 genes involved in conjugative transfer, 10 codes for putative transmembrane proteins (e.g. trsb, trac, trsf, trsj, and trsl). the enterococcal part is joined into the pip501 part by insertion elements is1216v of e. faecium tn1545 (three copies), and homologs of is1062 (e. faecalis) and is1485 (e. faecium). pre25 demonstrates that enterococci from fermented food do participate in the molecular communication between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria of the human and animal microflora.

AB  == the activity of garenoxacin, a new quinolone, was determined in comparison with other quinolones against different strains of s. pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci (vgs), and enterococcus faecalis. strains were quinolone-susceptible clinical isolates and quinolone-resistant strains with defined mechanisms of resistance obtained from either clinical isolates or derivatives of s. pneumoniae r6. clinical quinolone-susceptible strains of s. pneumoniae, vgs and e. faecalis  showed garenoxacin mics within a range of 0.03 microg/ml to 0.25 micro g/ml. garenoxacin mics increased two- to eightfold when one mutation was present in the parc quinolone resistance-determining region (qrdr), fourfold when one mutation was present in the gyra qrdr (s. pneumoniae), 8- to 64-fold when two or three mutations were associated in parc and gyra qrdr, and 2,048-fold when two mutations were present in both the gyra and parc qrdrs (streptococcus pneumoniae). increased active efflux had a moderate effect on garenoxacin mics for s. pneumoniae and vgs. against s. pneumoniae, garenoxacin behaved like moxifloxacin and sparfloxacin, being more affected by a single gyra mutation than by a single parc mutation. although garenoxacin was generally two- to fourfold more active than moxifloxacin against the different wild-type or mutant strains of s. pneumoniae, vgs, and e. faecalis, it was two- to fourfold less active than  gemifloxacin. at four times the respective mic for each strain, the bactericidal  effect of garenoxacin, observed at 6 h for s. pneumoniae and at 24 h for s. oralis and e. faecalis, was not influenced by the presence of mutation either in  the parc or in both the parc and gyra qrdrs.

'mgp' gutta-percha cones presoaked in sterile water were transferred to the inoculated agar and incubated at 37 degrees c aerobically or anaerobically as required for optimal growth. identical studies were performed using iodoform-free gutta-percha and sterile paper disks saturated with 10% povidone-iodine. following incubation, zones of inhibition around the 'mgp' gutta-percha, iodoform-free gutta-percha and disks were evaluated. results: povidone-iodine inhibited all the strains. iodoform-free gutta-percha inhibited s. sanguis and a. odontolyticus. 'mgp' gutta-percha inhibited s. aureus, s. sanguis, a. odontolyticus and f. nucleatum. neither iodoform-free gutta-percha nor 'mgp' gutta-percha inhibited growth of e. faecalis, e. coli or p. aeruginosa. conclusions: compared to iodoform-free gutta-percha, iodoform-containing 'mgp' gutta-percha had an inhibitory effect in vitro on s. aureus and f. nucleatum, but not on e. faecalis, e. coli or p. aeruginosa.

AB  == three vancomycin-resistant veal calf fecal streptococci, identified as streptococcus gallolyticus (n = 2) and streptococcus lutetiensis, were shown to harbor vanb2 tn5382-like elements earlier described in enterococci. one s. gallolyticus strain had a 1,495-bp is256-related element inserted in vans(b). the vanb2 tn5382 element present in the plasmid-free s. lutetiensis strain was transferable to enterococcus faecium bm4105-rf, enterococcus faecalis jh2-2, and  its recombination-deficient derivative, uv202. the transfer frequencies were comparable between recipient strains (from 1 x 10(-7) to 7 x 10(-6)). all transconjugants acquired a vanb-containing chromosomal insert of approximately 100 kb, apparently by site-specific integration. secondary transconjugants were not observed in intraspecies retransfer experiments. these observations are consistent with a conjugative, selftransmissible, integrative element that might  be involved in the interspecies spread of vanb2 resistance determinants. two jh2-2-derived transconjugants had also gained additional copies of large vanb-containing chromosomal fragments, a process that involves unexplained mechanisms that seems to require functional host cell-dependent recombination mechanisms.

TI  == small-fragment genomic libraries for the display of putative epitopes from clinically significant pathogens.
AB  == taking advantage of whole genome sequences of bacterial pathogens in many thriving diseases with global impact, we developed a comprehensive screening procedure for the identification of putative vaccine candidate antigens. importantly, this procedure relies on highly representative small-fragment genomic libraries that are expressed to display frame-selected epitope-size peptides on a bacterial cell surface and to interact directly with carefully selected disease-relevant high-titer sera. here we describe the generation of small-fragment genomic libraries of gram-positive and gram-negative clinically significant pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus  pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, helicobacter pylori, chlamydia pneumoniae, the enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, and campylobacter jejuni. large-scale sequencing revealed that the libraries, which provide an average of 20-fold coverage, were random and, as demonstrated with two s. aureus libraries, highly representative. consistent with the comprehensive nature of this approach is the  identification of epitopes that reside in both annotated and putatively novel open reading frames. the use of these libraries therefore allows for the rapid and direct identification of immunogenic epitopes with no apparent bias or difficulty that often associate with conventional expression methods.

TI  == a prospective study of infections in lung cancer patients admitted to the hospital.
AB  == study objectives: to determine the type of infections occurring in hospitalized patients with lung cancer. design: prospective cohort study. setting: department  of internal medicine in a cancer hospital. patients: all patients with lung cancer who were hospitalized for any cause and who acquired infections at the time of admission or during the hospital stay between january 1997 and february 2001. interventions: none. results: two hundred seventy-five patients with lung cancer had 435 episodes of fever and/or microbiologically or otherwise documented infection. two hundred eighteen patients (79.3%) presented with non-small cell lung carcinoma, while 49 patients (17.8%) had small cell lung cancer. the majority of the infections occurred in the tracheobronchial tree (56%). there were 38 episodes of bacteremia or fungemia, and the primary site of infection was identified in 18 cases (47%). microbiologically documented infections accounted for 61% of the infectious episodes, and included a total of 312 microorganisms. the most frequent pathogens were gram-negative bacteria (64%), followed by gram-positive bacteria (25%) and fungi (8%). the predominant gram-negative bacteria were haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis. staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and enterococcus faecalis essentially represented the gram-positive bacteria. no multiresistant bacteria were observed. bacteria were susceptible to most of the antibiotics classically administered for their treatment. conclusions: the predominant site of infection in patients with lung cancer is the tracheobronchial tree, with s pneumoniae, s aureus, h influenzae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and m catarrhalis as the principal pathogens.

TI  == bacterial translocation after cirrhotic liver resection: a clinical investigation of 181 patients.
AB  == background: cirrhotic patients are usually associated with a high susceptibility  to infection. although bacterial translocation from gut mucosa to mesenteric lymph node (mln) and systemic circulation is a well-known phenomenon after hepatectomy, its role in cirrhotic patients remains unclear. materials and methods: mln was harvested for bacterial culture before and after liver resection in 181 cirrhotic patients. the characteristics and postoperative courses of patients with positive and negative bacterial culture for mln after hepatectomy were compared. postoperative systemic antibiotics were administered if infectious complications occurred. results: no bacteria were cultured in mln before hepatectomy. bacterial translocation (bt) to mln after hepatectomy occurred in 36 patients (bt group). after multivariate analysis, intraoperative blood transfusion was the only independent factor that influenced bacterial translocation rates after cirrhotic liver resection. bt group patients also had higher infectious and overall complication rates, with a longer postoperative hospital stay. among the cultured bacteriae from infected sites in bt group patients with infectious complications, only 2 patients (12.5%) had totally different bacterial species to those cultured from mlns. conclusions: bacterial translocation more often occurred after liver resection in cirrhotic patients who received intraoperative blood transfusion. such patients had higher postoperative infectious and overall complication rates. thus, avoidance of intraoperative blood transfusion is mandatory for cirrhotic liver resection.

AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the transfer (tra) region of the multiresistance broad-host-range inc18 plasmid pip501 was completed. the 8629-bp dna sequence encodes 10 open reading frames (orf), 9 of them are possibly involved in pip501 conjugative transfer. the putative pip501 tra gene products show highest similarity to the respective orfs of the conjugative enterococcus faecalis plasmids pre25 and pambeta1, and the streptococcus pyogenes plasmid psm19035, respectively. orf7 and orf10 encode putative homologues of type iv secretion systems involved in transport of effector molecules from pathogens to host cells  and in conjugative plasmid transfer in gram-negative (g-) bacteria. pip501 mobilized non-selftransmissible plasmids such as pmv158 between different e. faecalis strains and from e. faecalis to bacillus subtilis. evidence for the very broad-host-range of pip501 was obtained by intergeneric conjugative transfer of pip501 to a multicellular gram-positive (g+) bacterium, streptomyces lividans, and to g- escherichia coli. we proved for the first time pip501 replication, expression of its antibiotic resistance genes as well as functionality of the pip501 tra genes in s. lividans and e. coli.

TI  == relationship between semen cultures, leukospermia, and semen analysis in men undergoing fertility evaluation.
AB  == objective: to determine the correlation between semen cultures, semen gram stains, leukospermia, and semen analysis parameters in asymptomatic men undergoing fertility evaluation. design: prospective clinical study. settings: infertility clinic at a university teaching hospital. patient(s): two hundred ninety-nine asymptomatic men undergoing fertility evaluation. intervention(s): after an antibacterial skin preparation, all men gave semen specimens for culture, gram stains, semen analysis, and assessment for leukospermia. main outcome measure(s): a comparison of the presence or absence of bacteriospermia, the specific bacterial isolate, the quantity of bacteriospermia, the presence or  absence of leukospermia, and semen analysis parameters. result(s): the presence or absence of bacteriospermia or leukospermia did not correlate with each other.  leukospermia did not correlate with semen parameters. staphylococcus species was  the most common isolate (25.4% of all patients) and did not correlate with semen  parameters or leukospermia. streptococcus viridans (15.4% of all patients) and enterococcus faecalis (7.4% of all patients) were the next most common isolates and were associated with statistically significantly poorer semen quality. conclusion(s): leukospermia is a poor marker for either bacteriospermia or impaired semen quality. staphylococcus species are commonly isolated but appear to be innocuous. streptococcus viridans and enterococcus faecalis are associated  with poorer semen quality and may warrant treatment.

TI  == the world health organization's external quality assurance system proficiency testing program has improved the accuracy of antimicrobial susceptibility testing and reporting among participating laboratories using nccls methods.
AB  == a total of 150 laboratories in 33 countries that followed the nccls testing procedures participated in the world health organization's external quality assurance system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eqas-ast) from january 1998 through march 2001. laboratories tested seven bacterial isolates for antimicrobial resistance and reported the results to the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) in atlanta, ga. the results were compared to the results generated at the cdc with the nccls broth microdilution and disk diffusion reference methods. although there were few testing errors with salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar enteritidis, drugs that are not appropriate for therapy of salmonella infections were tested and reported by 136  (91%) of 150 laboratories. in addition, 29 (20%) of 150 laboratories used the staphylococcus aureus breakpoints to report oxacillin results for staphylococcus  saprophyticus. for a vanb-containing enterococcus faecalis strain, 124 (83%) of 150 laboratories correctly reported vancomycin results that were +/-1 doubling dilution from the reference mic or +/-3 mm from the reference disk diffusion result. of the laboratories that tested streptococcus agalactiae by disk diffusion, 17% reported nonsusceptible results for penicillin in error. while 110 laboratories (73%) tested the s. pneumoniae challenge isolate against a fluoroquinolone, 83% tested it against ciprofloxacin, for which there are no nccls interpretive criteria. ten of 12 laboratories testing levofloxacin and 4 of 4 laboratories testing ofloxacin by an mic method correctly reported resistant results for the isolate. feedback letters sent to participating laboratories highlighted areas of susceptibility testing in individual laboratories that needed improvement. the positive impact of the feedback letters and the overall effectiveness of the eqas program were documented in repeat testing challenges with pneumococci and staphylococci. the 31 and 19% increases in the numbers of laboratories using appropriate testing methods for pneumococci and staphylococci, respectively, in 2000 versus 1998 indicate that laboratory performance is improving.

TI  == role of the enterococcus faecalis gele protease in determination of cellular chain length, supernatant pheromone levels, and degradation of fibrin and misfolded surface proteins.
AB  == gelatinase (gele), a secreted zn-metalloprotease of enterococcus faecalis, has been implicated as a virulence factor by both epidemiological data and animal model studies. expression of gele is induced at a high cell density by the fsr quorum-sensing system. in the present study, gele was shown to be responsible for the instability of a number of asc10 (aggregation substance) mutant proteins, implying that gele functions to clear the bacterial cell surface of misfolded proteins. disruption of gele production led to increased cell chain length of e.  faecalis, from a typical diplococcus morphology to chains of 5 to 10 cells. this  function of gele was also exhibited when the protein was expressed in streptococcus pyogenes. gele-expressing e. faecalis strains were more autolytic,  suggesting that gele affects chain length through activation of an autolysin. gele was also essential for degradation of polymerized fibrin. gele expression reduced the titer of ccf10, the peptide pheromone that induces conjugation of pcf10, and pcf10 had increased conjugation into non-gele-expressing strains. these new functions attributed to gele suggest that it acts to increase the dissemination of e. faecalis in high-density environments.

TI  == additive antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide and chlorhexidine on common  endodontic bacterial pathogens.
AB  == it is an established procedure to use calcium hydroxide [ca(oh)2] as a therapeutic component to achieve sterilization of infected root canals. unfortunately, some bacterial species are relatively resistant to ca(oh)2 and are therefore associated with treatment failures. the objective of this study was to  identify combinations of substances that improve antimicrobial activity. ca(oh)2  was used as a suspension or as a component of gutta-percha points. efficacy of killing was compared for (a) ca(oh)2 suspension alone; (b) zinc oxide (zno) points alone; (c) ca(oh)2 suspension combined with zno points; (d) ca(oh)2 suspension combined with zno/chlorhexidine points; and (e) ca(oh)2 points combined with zno/chlorhexidine points. common endodontopathogenic bacterial species (enterococcus faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus intermedius) in pure cultures served as target organisms. in the in vitro assay, the antibacterial substances and approximately 10(7) colony forming units of test bacteria were co-incubated in diluted human serum under growth conditions appropriate for the single bacterial species. samples were taken on days 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14 of incubation and viable counts determined. gram-negative bacteria were sufficiently killed by  ca(oh)2 alone. combinations with other agents did not improve the killing kinetics. for the inactivation of the gram-positive bacteria p. micros and s. intermedius, a combination of ca(oh)2 and zno/chlorhexidine, killed the bacteria  faster than ca(oh)2 alone. for e. faecalis, combining ca(oh)2 suspension with zno/chlorhexidine points lead to a faster decrease in the overall number of viable bacteria, but no test conditions lead to the complete loss of culture viability. the results of this study support the use of a combination of ca(oh)2  and chlorhexidine for faster eradication of p. micros and s. intermedius from infected root canals.

TI  == linezolid resistance since 2001: sentry antimicrobial surveillance program.
AB  == background: the oxazolidinone class of antimicrobials has demonstrated remarkable activity against gram-positive cocci. linezolid has proven to be a first-line therapeutic option for vancomycin-resistant strains. linezolid clinical trial results and subsequent published case reports cite rare resistance emerging in patients receiving prolonged therapy. objective: to report the initial linezolid-resistant organisms from cases obtained through the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program, after screening >40,000 gram-positive cocci without resistance between 1998 and 2000. methods: during 2001-2002, 8 resistant  strains (from 8 different patients) located in 6 states from 7 different participating sentry institutions in the us were identified among bloodstream, respiratory, skin and soft tissue, and urinary tract infection isolates of enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus oralis. resistance was detected by reference broth microdilution methods and confirmed by identical results using etest (ab biodisk, solna, sweden) and the standardized disk diffusion method. results: minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and disk diffusion tests showed elevated mics (> or =8 microg/ml) and small inhibitory zone diameters (< or =15 mm) for all strains to both linezolid and the investigational oxazolidinone azd2563. vancomycin resistance was detected in 2 of the 8 linezolid-resistant strains. all enterococci and the viridans-group streptococcus (s. oralis) strain showed resistance to erythromycin. e. faecium strains were resistant to penicillins, but susceptible to quinupristin/dalfopristin. only 3 of the patients had previously received the drug. conclusions: linezolid resistance remains rare, with only 8 isolates among 9833 (0.08%) monitored isolates identified between january 1, 2001, and june 30, 2002. resistance, however, was no longer limited to enterococci. clinical laboratories should test linezolid more widely to detect emerging resistance, especially for patients receiving oxazolidinone therapy. longitudinal surveillance programs are warranted to detect a trend in the development of resistance, determine the molecular mechanism of resistance, and recommend alternative therapies or epidemiologic interventions.

TI  == indole naphthyridinones as inhibitors of bacterial enoyl-acp reductases fabi and  fabk.
AB  == bacterial enoyl-acp reductase (fabi) is responsible for catalyzing the final step of bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis and is an attractive target for the development of novel antibacterial agents. previously we reported the development of fabi inhibitor 4 with narrow spectrum antimicrobial activity and in vivo efficacy against staphylococcus aureus via intraperitoneal (ip) administration. through iterative medicinal chemistry aided by x-ray crystal structure analysis,  a new series of inhibitors has been developed with greatly increased potency against fabi-containing organisms. several of these new inhibitors have potent antibacterial activity against multidrug resistant strains of s. aureus, and compound 30 demonstrates exceptional oral (po) in vivo efficacy in a s. aureus infection model in rats. while optimizing fabi inhibitory activity, compounds 29  and 30 were identified as having low micromolar fabk inhibitory activity, thereby increasing the antimicrobial spectrum of these compounds to include the fabk-containing pathogens streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis. the results described herein support the hypothesis that bacterial enoyl-acp reductases are valid targets for antibacterial agents.

TI  == cell wall attachment of a widely distributed peptidoglycan binding domain is hindered by cell wall constituents.
AB  == the c-terminal region (ca) of the major autolysin acma of lactococcus lactis contains three highly similar repeated regions of 45 amino acid residues (lysm domains), which are separated by nonhomologous sequences. the ca domain could be  deleted without destroying the cell wall-hydrolyzing activity of the enzyme in vitro. this acma derivative was capable neither of binding to lactococcal cells nor of lysing these cells while separation of the producer cells was incomplete.  the ca domain and a chimeric protein consisting of ca fused to the c terminus of  msa2, a malaria parasite surface antigen, bound to lactococcal cells specifically via ca. the fusion protein also bound to many other gram-positive bacteria. by chemical treatment of purified cell walls of l. lactis and bacillus subtilis, peptidoglycan was identified as the cell wall component interacting with ca. immunofluorescence studies showed that binding is on specific locations on the surface of l. lactis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus thermophilus, b. subtilis, lactobacillus sake, and lactobacillus casei cells. based on these studies, we propose that lysm-type repeats bind to peptidoglycan and that binding is hindered by other cell wall constituents, resulting in localized binding of acma. lipoteichoic acid is a candidate hindering component. for l. lactis sk110,  it is shown that lipoteichoic acids are not uniformly distributed over the cell surface and are mainly present at sites where no msa2ca binding is observed.

TI  == microorganisms from canals of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions.
AB  == aim: the objective of the present study was to identify the microbial flora within root canals of teeth with failed root-canal treatment and to determine the association of the various species with clinical features. methodology: sixty root-filled teeth with persisting periapical lesions were selected for this study. during nonsurgical endodontic re-treatment, the root-filling material was  removed and the canals were sampled. microbial sampling, isolation and species determination were performed using advanced microbiological techniques for anaerobic species. the association of microbiological findings with clinical features was investigated. results: microorganisms were recovered from 51 teeth.  in most cases, one or two strains per canal were found. of the microbial species  isolated, 57.4% were facultative anaerobic species and 83.3% gram-positive microorganisms. enterococcus faecalis was the most frequently recovered bacterial species. obligate anaerobes accounted for 42.6% of the species and the most frequently isolated genera was peptostreptococcus. which was associated with clinical symptoms (p < 0.01). significant associations were also observed between: (a) pain or history of pain and polymicrobial infections or anaerobes (p < 0.05): (b) tenderness to percussion and prevotella intermedia/p. nigrescens (p  < 0.05); (c) sinus and streptococcus spp. (p < 0.001) or actinomyces spp. (p < 0.01); (d) coronally unsealed teeth and streptococcus spp. or candida spp. (both  with p < 0.01). conclusion: the microbial flora in canals after failure of root-canal treatment were limited to a small number of predominantly gram-positive microbial species. facultative anaerobes, especially e. faecalis, were the most commonly isolated microorganisms, however, polymicrobial infections and obligate anaerobes were frequently found in canals of symptomatic root-filled teeth.

TI  == microbiology of choledochal bile in patients with choledocholithiasis admitted to a tertiary hospital.
AB  == aim: the present study was designed to investigate the microbiology of choledochal bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis. methods: we identified and determined the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp). results: nineteen (82.6%) of 23 patients with choledocholithiasis had positive bile cultures. a single agent was detected in 11 patients (57.9%), while a mixed growth, with pathogens ranging from two to three species, were seen in eight patients (42.1%). patients with clinical manifestations of cholangitis had significantly higher counts of colonies per ml of bile (> 105 cfu/ml). the predominant gram-negative aerobic bacteria isolated were escherichia coli (9, 31.0%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5, 17.2%), enterobacter cloacae (2, 6.9%), pantoea agglomerans (1, 3.4%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (1, 3.4%). the predominant gram-positive bacteria were enterococcus faecalis (5, 17.2%) and streptococcus sp. (5, 17.2%). bacteroides fragilis was isolated in one patient with mixed growth. all gram-positive bacteria isolated in bile were sensitive to ampicillin, and all gram-negative bacteria isolated were sensitive to gentamicin with a minimum inhibitory concentration (cim90) ranging from 0.5 to 1.0- micro g/ml. gram-negative bacteria were also sensitive to imipenem, fluorquinolones, second and third generation cephalosporins. although all five isolates of e. faecalis were sensitive to ampicillin, two of five (40%) e. faecalis isolates demonstrated high levels of resistance to gentamicin. conclusion: e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. faecalis and streptoccocus sp. were the most common bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis, which were sensitive to a simple therapeutic regimen, such as the combination of ampicilin and gentamicin.

TI  == molecular diagnosis of infective endocarditis by pcr amplification and direct sequencing of dna from valve tissue.
AB  == we used broad-range eubacterial pcr amplification followed by direct sequencing to identify microbial pathogens in heart valve material from 29 patients with histologically confirmed infective endocarditis and 23 patients free of infective endocarditis. microorganisms cultured by conventional techniques matched those identified by pcr in 21 cases. pcr alone identified the causative agent in three  cases (streptococcus bovis, staphylococcus cohnii, and coxiella burnetii), allowing better patient management. pcr corrected the initial bacteriological diagnosis in three cases (streptococcus bovis, streptococcus mutans, and bartonella henselae). among the 29 cases of histologically confirmed infective endocarditis, pcr findings were positive in 27 cases and were consistent with the bacterial morphology seen at gram staining (26 cases) or with the results obtained by immunohistologic analysis with an anti-c. burnetii monoclonal antibody (one case). in two other cases of histologically confirmed infective endocarditis, pcr remained negative in a blood culture-negative case for which no bacteria were seen at histological analysis and in one case with visualization of cocci and blood cultures positive for enterococcus faecalis. ten clinical diagnoses of possible infective endocarditis were ruled out by histopathological  analysis of the valves and subsequently by pcr. pcr was negative in 13 of the 14  patients in whom infective endocarditis was rejected on clinical grounds; the other patient was found to have coxiella burnetii infective endocarditis on the basis of pcr and histopathological analysis and was subsequently included in the  group of 29 definite cases. in total, pcr contributed to the diagnosis and management of infective endocarditis in 6 of 29 (20%) cases.

TI  == prospective study using standardized methodology for antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-positive cocci isolated from the puerto rico medical center.
AB  == the gram-positive cocci (gpc), staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, have become important causes of community and nosocomial-acquired infections. the prevalence of multiple resistant isolates to standard antimicrobial drugs has significantly increased over the past decades. few prospective studies have been performed in puerto rico (pr) concerning the gpc antimicrobial susceptibilities pattern. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the in vitro susceptibility of gpc clinical isolates from pr to selected standard antibiotics and to the new antimicrobial agents, linezolid (lz), quinupristin/dalfopristin (q/d) and gemifloxacin (gm). the in vitro susceptibility utilizing disk diffusion and etest methods to selected antibiotics was determined for a total of 429 isolates obtained during a period of 5 months from the puerto rico medical center bacteriology laboratory. the distribution of gpc collected was as follows: 213 s. aureus isolates, 162 e. faecalis, 16 e. faecium and 38 s. pneumoniae. the results of the susceptibility test demonstrated: 1) that in s. aureus, 100% of the isolates were susceptible to vancomycin (van), lz and q/d; 93% to gm; and 61% to methicillin/oxacillin; 2) in  s. pneumoniae, 100% were susceptible to ln and gm; 87% to q/d; and 53% to penicillin; 3) in e. faecalis, 99% were susceptible to ampicillin; 93% to lz; 79% to gm; 78.6% to van; and 0% to q/d. sixty eight and 66% of the e. faecalis isolates were susceptible to gentamicin and streptomycin respectively; and 4) in  e. faecium, 100% were susceptible to lz; 94% to q/d; 69% to gm; 37.5% to van and  20% to ampicillin. in e. faecium isolates, 50% and 31% were susceptible to gentamicin and streptomycin, respectively. of the vancomycin resistant enterococci, 88.9% and 21% of e. faecium and faecalis showed vana phenotypic resistance, respectively. these results show that there is a significant degree of antimicrobial resistance in gpc, including 38% methicillin resistance in s. aureus, a near 50% penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, and a significant resistance of enterococcal species to van. the new agents, lz, q/d and gm, proved to be effective against both, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae. for e. faecium, both,  lz and q/d were active, while for e. faecalis, only lz showed consistent activity.

TI  == etiology of acute otitis media in childhood and evaluation of two different protocols of antibiotic therapy: 10 days cefaclor vs. 3 days azitromycin.
AB  == background: acute otitis media (aom) is a common childhood infection that is frequently treated by antibiotics. there are no prospective and comprehensive trials evaluating childhood aom for etiologic pathogens and resistance pattern in turkey. the aims of the study were to determine the bacterial etiologies and resistance patterns, and identify the efficacy and the relapse rates of 3 days of azitromycin and 10 days of cefaclor therapy in aom. methods: this prospective, randomized, single-blind, open study was carried out in 78 cases of aom. mean age was 30.7+/-27 months. tympanocentesis and aspiration of middle ear fluid (mef) were used to obtain purulent material from the middle ear. group 1 consisted of the cases (n=41) on azitromycin therapy and group 2 (n=37) on cefaclor. dosage of azitromycin was 10 mg/kg per day for 3 days and cefaclor 40 mg/kg per day for 10  days. the patients were evaluated on days 3-5 (second visit), day 10 (third visit), and day 30 (fourth visit) during follow-up. results: a total of 50 species were isolated from 44 of 78 cases from which materials were obtained (44/78; 56.4%). most frequently isolated microorganism was streptococcus pneumoniae (n=18; 36%), followed by haemophilus influenzae (n=11; 22%), s. aureus (n=9; 18%), moraxella catarrhalis (n=4; 8%), and group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus (gas, n=4; 8%). enterococcus faecalis was isolated from three cases and h. parainfluenzae from one. penicillin and amoxicillin resistances of bacteria were found to be 40 and 36%, respectively. the frequency of penicillin and amoxicillin resistance in </=24-month age group was 59 and 66.6%, respectively. the patients did not demonstrate significant differences in terms of cure rate on the third to fifth day (group 1: 32.5%; group 2: 36.4%), 10th day (group 1: 76.9%; group 2: 84.8%), and on 30th day (group 1: 91.3%; group 2: 81.8%). there were no significant differences with respect to side effects, relapse, and re-infection rate between the two groups. conclusion: in more than half of the aom cases, bacteria were isolated from mef and most frequently isolated organisms were s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, and s. aureus. three-day azitromycin therapy was as effective as 10-day cefaclor therapy.

TI  == mc21-a, a bactericidal antibiotic produced by a new marine bacterium, pseudoalteromonas phenolica sp. nov. o-bc30(t), against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == we previously reported a new marine bacterium, pseudoalteromonas phenolica sp. nov. o-bc30(t), which produced a bactericidal antibiotic against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). in the present study, we purified an anti-mrsa substance (mc21-a) from the methanol extract of the cells of p. phenolica o-bc30(t) and analyzed its chemical structure. mc21-a was determined to be 3,3',5,5'-tetrabromo-2,2'-biphenyldiol by spectrometric analyses. its anti-mrsa activity against 10 clinical isolates of mrsa was comparable to that of vancomycin (mc21-a mics, 1 to 2 micro g/ml; vancomycin mics, <0.25 to 2 micro g/ml). this substance was also high active against enterococcus serolicida, enterococcus faecium, and enterococcus faecalis but was  less active against streptococcus spp. a time-kill study also demonstrated that mc21-a was bactericidal and that its killing rate was much higher than that of vancomycin. the postantibiotic effect (pae) of mc21-a against a clinical mrsa isolate, strain e 31243, was also comparable to that of vancomycin (mc21-a paes,  1.46 to 1.65 h; vancomycin paes, 0.84 to 1.43 h). however, a lysis experiment demonstrated that this substance failed to lyse mrsa cells. this substance also did not lyse human erythrocytes. a sytox green staining experiment implied that this substance permeabilized the cell membrane of mrsa as its mode of action. when its activities against a hypersensitive escherichia coli mutant (ko 1489) and wild-type strains were tested, mc21-a exhibited higher levels of activity against the former. furthermore, mc21-a was not cytotoxic to human normal fibroblast, rat pheochromocytoma, and vero cells at concentrations up to 50 micro g/ml. these results suggest that mc21-a might be useful as a lead compound in the development of new types of anti-mrsa substances with modes of action different from those of vancomycin and teicoplanin.

AB  == background and aims of the study: the study aim was to identify the value of broad-range bacterial pcr in infective endocarditis (ie) of bacterial etiology, and to determine its specificity and sensitivity. methods: thirty blood samples were taken for analysis from patients with ie (diagnosed according to duke criteria) and acquired valvular heart disease. two control groups of patients with (n = 10) or without (n = 15) urinary tract infection were defined. dna was isolated, and three different primer pairs for the region of the gene coding for  16s rrna were tested, to determine the most specific pair. amplification products were analyzed with gel electrophoresis, stained with ethidium bromide, and located under uv light. results: positive blood cultures were found in 25 patients with ie. a typical echocardiography picture with bacterial vegetations was found in all patients with sterile blood cultures, and in 20 patients with positive blood cultures. the highest specificity was found for forward/reverse (f/r) primers, as the relevant amplified pcr product was present in all blood samples with ie, and in four of 10 patients with urinary tract infection. conclusion: broad-range pcr in bacterial endocarditis is a rapid, sensitive and inexpensive technique for the detection of bacteria, but is far more prone to contamination than species-specific pcr. however, under controlled conditions, broad-range pcr may be valuable for the identification of non-specific infection, permitting a more rapid clinical diagnosis of endocarditis.

AB  == this in vitro study evaluated the microbial leakage of cavit, irm, and dyract when used as temporary filling materials after root canal treatment. the degree of coronal leakage was assessed by using a microbiological marker consisting of streptococcus faecalis and candida albicans. for each of the two organisms, a set of 15 maxillary premolars were prepared chemomechanically and obturated with thermoplasticized gutta-percha. a 3.5-mm thick layer of one of the three temporary filling materials was inserted in the access cavities of the teeth from each group (each group was compromised of five teeth). the control teeth (four positive and four negative) lacked any filling material over the gutta-percha, whereas the orifice and the apical foramen of the negative control were completely sealed with nail polish. each tooth was placed in a well of a 24-well  tissue culture plate and embedded in trypticase soy broth and 0.5% bactoagar. an  organism suspension was inoculated in the access cavity, and microbial penetration was detected as an increase in turbidity of the broth. at the end of  30 days, the results showed that all positive control teeth leaked within 1 week, whereas those that served as negative control remained uncontaminated throughout  the test period. with both organisms, irm started to leak after 10 days, whereas  cavit and dyract leaked after 2 weeks.

TI  == microbial susceptibility to calcium hydroxide pastes and their vehicles.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the susceptibility of some microorganisms commonly isolated from root canals to calcium hydroxide in combination with several vehicles by the agar diffusion method. stainless-steel cylinders were placed on each inoculated agar medium. the test medications and their controls were placed inside the cylinders. the zones of growth inhibition were measured and recorded after the incubation period for each plate, and the results were analyzed statistically. enterococcus faecalis was most resistant, whereas the anaerobic porphyromonas endodontalis was more susceptible to all medications, followed by p. gingivalis and prevotella intermedial intermedia. ca(oh)2 + cmcp + glycerin showed significantly larger mean zones of inhibition when compared with the other medications. we conclude that anaerobic gram-negative bacteria are more susceptible to calcium hydroxide pastes than facultative gram-positive microorganisms.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of bal9141, a novel parenteral cephalosporin active against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci.
AB  == community-acquired and nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-positive pathogens continue to increase in prevalence and have become a serious problem in many parts of the world. bal9141 is a member of the class of parenteral pyrrolidinone-3-ylidenemethyl cephalosporins, and has a broad spectrum of activity. in the current study, bal9141 was tested against a large number (n = 2263) of recent isolates from various international surveillance programmes including 1097 gram-positive strains. susceptibility to (s) and activity of (mg/l) to bal9141, based on proposed breakpoints (mic50/mic90/% s) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (0.5/0.5/100%), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) (1/2/100%), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (0.12/0.25/100%), methicillin-resistant cons (mr-cons) (1/2/100%), streptococcus pneumoniae (< or = 0.015/0.25/100%), viridans group streptococci (0.03/0.5/99%), beta-haemolytic streptococci (< or =  0.015/< or = 0.015/100%), enterococcus faecalis (0.5/16/90%), enterococcus faecium (>32/>32/22%), haemophilus influenzae (0.06/0.06/100%), moraxella catarrhalis (0.06/0.5/100%), neisseria gonorrhoeae (0.03/0.06/100%) and neisseria meningitidis (< or = 0.002/0.004/100%). bal9141 susceptibility at < pr = 4 mg/l (100% s) surpassed that of ceftriaxone (cro; 1% s) and quinupristin/dalfopristin  (q-d; 92% s) against mrsa and mr-cons (cro 0.9% s; q-d 94% s). all s. pneumoniae  were inhibited by bal9141 at < or = 1 mg/l compared with cro (90% s) and levofloxacin (lvx; 98% s). susceptibility rates for viridans group streptococci to bal9141 (>98%) were also higher than to cro (86%) and lvx (96%). bal9141 demonstrated excellent activity against most species of wild-type enteric bacilli, with > or = 95% of isolates being susceptible; however, only modest activity was observed for bal9141 against non-fermentative gram-negative species  and esbl-producing escherichia coli or klebsiella pneumoniae. bal9141 demonstrated excellent activity against many tested pathogens displaying various  resistance phenotypes, and should be particularly valuable in the treatment of mrsa as well as for drug-resistant streptococci, while maintaining a spectrum resembling a 'third-generation' cephalosporin against other clinically important  species.

TI  == sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles in the detection of cornea organ culture media contamination by bacteria and fungi.
AB  == aims: to test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. methods: the bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 iu/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin b was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees c with five inocula of 14 bacteria. two yeasts  (candida spp) and one aspergillus were also tested. contaminated media were then  inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened  daily by visual inspection. the sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. results: organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria  irrespective of the starting inoculums: streptococcus pneumoniae, branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, propionibacterium acnes, and haemophilus influenzae. for micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal  only (methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, bacillus subtilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans, candida kruzei, aspergillus  fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (sd 13.8, range 2-52). in cases of detection by the  blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. conclusions: blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.

TI  == total synthesis and biological evaluation of (5z,9z)-5,9-hexadecadienoic acid, an inhibitor of human topoisomerase i.
AB  == the naturally occurring (5z,9z)-5,9-hexadecadienoic acid was synthesized stereochemically pure in six steps starting with commercially available 1,5-hexadiyne. the title compound was antimicrobial against the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus (mic 80 microm) and streptococcus faecalis (mic 200 microm), but inactive against gram-negative bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa. in addition, the (5z,9z)-5,9-hexadecadienoic acid completely inhibits human topoisomerase i at a concentration of 800 microm, while 5,9-hexadecadiynoic acid and hexadecanoic acid do not inhibit topoisomerase i (>1000 microm). this comparison reveals that the cis double bond geometry in the title compound is required for topoisomerase i inhibition. moreover, these results suggest that the antimicrobial activity of (5z,9z)-5,9-hexadecadienoic acid against either s. aureus or s. faecalis could be a result, at least in part, of the inhibitory activity of the acid against topoisomerases.

TI  == innate immune responses of human neonatal cells to bacteria from the normal gastrointestinal flora.
AB  == the hygiene hypothesis postulates that the prevalence of allergy has increased due to decreased microbial stimulation early in life, leading to delayed maturation of the immune system. the aim of this study was to examine the cytokine pattern produced from cord blood mononuclear cells relative to adult cells after stimulation with bacterial strains from the normal flora. mononuclear cells from cord and adult blood samples were stimulated with the following bacteria: bifidobacterium adolescentis, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus mitis, corynebacterium minutissimum, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides vulgatus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, veillonella parvula, and neisseria sicca. the levels of interleukin 12 (il-12), tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), il-10, and il-6 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the tnf-alpha production was also analyzed after blocking cd14, toll-like receptor 2 (tlr-2), and tlr-4 prior to stimulation with bacteria. the levels of il-12 and tnf-alpha were similar in cord and adult cells. gram-positive bacteria induced considerably higher levels of il-12 and tnf-alpha than gram-negative bacteria in both cord and adult cells. the levels of il-6 were significantly higher in newborns than in adults, whereas the levels of  il-10 were similar in newborns and adults. gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria induced similar levels of il-6 and il-10 in cord cells. l. plantarum bound or signaled through cd14, tlr-2, and tlr-4, whereas e. coli acted mainly through cd14 and tlr-4. these results indicate that the innate immune response in newborns to commensal bacteria is strong and also suggest that different bacterial strains may have differential effects on the maturation of the immune system of infants.

TI  == [surveillance for antimicrobial resistance: vira study].
AB  == introduction: resistance to antimicrobial drugs has increased in recent years. the aim of this multicenter study was to determine the current situation in spain regarding the resistance patterns of the most common infectious agents to antimicrobial drugs. material and methods: a total 1,475 strains isolated in 38 hospitals in october 2001 were studied. these included 294 methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), 149 clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), 96 enterococcus faecium, 1 ampicillin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, 204 penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, 100 ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae, 361 ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli, 160 pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 110 acinetobacter baumannii. sensitivity to various antibiotics was studied by a broth microdilution method. additionally, an epidemiologic survey was conducted in the participating hospitals to determine the incidence of these multi-drug resistant microorganisms. results: overall incidence of ciprofloxacin-resistant e. coli and mrsa strains was 24% in both cases. the pneumococci were resistant to several antibiotics. telithromycin showed excellent activity against all the pneumococci, including those resistant to macrolides. most mrsa isolates were resistant to quinolones and macrolides. all the staphylococci were susceptible to linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin. only 50% of a. baumannii strains were susceptible  to imipenem. conclusion: the results of this study evidence increasing multi-drug resistance among various microorganisms, such as mrsa, cns, ampicillin-resistant  enterococci, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci, and underline the need for surveillance programs to gain information on this significant therapeutic problem.

TI  == inhibition by yeast killer toxin-like antibodies of oral streptococci adhesion to tooth surfaces in an ex vivo model.
AB  == background: monoclonal (ktmab) and recombinant (ktscfv) anti-idiotypic antibodies, representing the internal image of a yeast killer toxin, proved to be microbicidal in vitro against important eukaryotic and prokaryotic pathogens such as candida albicans, pneumocystis carinii, mycobacterium tuberculosis, staphylococcus aureus, s. haemolyticus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae, including multidrug-resistant strains. ktmab and ktscfv exerted a strong therapeutic effect in well-established animal models of candidiasis and pneumocystosis. streptococcus mutans is the most important etiologic agent of dental caries that might result from the metabolic end products of dental plaque. effective strategies to reduce the disease potential of dental plaque have considered the possibility of using antibiotics or antibodies against oral streptococci in general and s. mutans in particular. in this study, the activity of ktmab and ktscfv against s. mutans and the inhibition and reduction by ktmab of dental colonization by s. mutans and other oral streptococci in an ex vivo model of human teeth were investigated. materials and  methods: ktscfv and ktmab were used in a conventional colony forming unit (cfu) assay against a serotype c strain of s. mutans, and other oral streptococci (s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. salivarius). an ex vivo model of human teeth submerged in saliva was used to establish ktmab potential of inhibiting or reducing the adhesion to dental surfaces by s. mutans and other oral streptococci. results: ktmab and ktscfv kill in vitro s. mutans and other oral streptococci. ktmab inhibit colonization of dental surfaces by s. mutans and oral streptococci in the ex vivo model. conclusions: killer antibodies with antibiotic activity or their engineered derivatives may have a potential in the prevention of dental caries in vivo.

TI  == a retrospective investigation of advanced periodontal disease as a risk factor for septicemia in hematopoietic stem cell and bone marrow transplant recipients.
AB  == objective: septicemia is a cause of death in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (hsct) recipients. extraction of teeth with advanced periodontitis has been advocated before hsct to prevent septicemia in myeloablated hosts. the primary aim of the present study was to determine impact of chronic periodontitis, as measured by radiographic alveolar bone loss, on septicemia and transplant mortality. study design: a retrospective design was used to study 77 subjects who received pretransplant dental evaluation, panoramic radiography, and full myeloablative allogeneic hsct to treat hematologic malignancies. radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss was measured with a schei ruler on all teeth. microorganisms isolated from positive blood cultures within the first 100 days after transplant were categorized as of likely origin from periodontal, oral, or  any body sites. spearman correlation and logistic regression analysis assessed associations between positive blood cultures, mean subject whole-mouth percent radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss, and 100-day survival. results: radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss per study subject averaged 13% +/- 7%, with 18.2% exhibiting bone loss of 20% or greater. during the initial 100 days after transplant, 63.6% subjects yielded septicemia-associated positive blood cultures, with staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli as the most common isolates recovered. no statistically significant associations were found between mean subject radiographic alveolar bone loss and septicemia of likely periodontal or oral origin. conclusion: in this preliminary study, no relationship was found between radiographic periodontal status and septicemia or  mortality within the initial 100 days after transplant. a larger-sized, prospective study is warranted to further delineate the risk of septicemia from periodontal and other oral diseases in immunocompromised patients.

TI  == influence of dry period bacterial intramammary infection on clinical mastitis in  dairy cows.
AB  == milk samples were taken from 1920 quarters (480 cows, six herds) on four occasions to examine the relationship between quarter level intramammary infection (imi) during the dry period and clinical mastitis in the next lactation. all quarters were sampled at drying off and within 1 wk of calving, and two quarters from each cow were sampled both 0 to 7 and 8 to 14 d before calving. milk samples were collected from all cases of clinical mastitis during the following lactation. logistic regression models were developed to investigate the associations between imi present during the sampling period and clinical mastitis. the probability of a quarter succumbing to clinical mastitis increased  when streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, or enterobacter spp. were cultured at drying off and when escherichia coli, coagulase-positive staphylococcus, serratia spp., or streptococcus faecalis were  cultured in two out of three late dry and post-calving samples. quarters from which corynebacterium spp. were isolated at drying off were at an increased risk  of clinical mastitis, whereas the presence of corynebacterium spp. in the late dry and post-calving samples was associated with a reduction in the risk of clinical mastitis. the risk of mastitis for specific pathogens increased if the same species of bacteria that had caused mastitis was isolated at least twice in  the late dry and post-calving samples. kaplan-meier survival plots indicated that clinical mastitis associated with dry period infections was more likely to occur  earlier in lactation than clinical mastitis not associated with dry period infections. there was evidence of quarter susceptibility to imi or the possibility that infection with one organism led to clinical mastitis with another.

TI  == functional analysis of traa, the sex pheromone receptor encoded by ppd1, in a promoter region essential for the mating response in enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == conjugative transfer of a bacteriocin plasmid, ppd1, of enterococcus faecalis is  induced in response to a peptide sex pheromone, cpd1, secreted from plasmid-free  recipient cells. cpd1 is taken up by a ppd1 donor cell and binds to an intracellular receptor, traa. once a recipient cell acquires ppd1, it starts to produce an inhibitor of cpd1, termed ipd1, which functions as a traa antagonist and blocks self-induction in donor cells. in this study, we discuss how traa transduces the signal of cpd1 to the mating response. gel mobility shift assays indicated that traa is bound to a traa-ipd intergenic region, which is essential  for cpd1 response. dnase i footprinting analysis suggested the presence of one strong (tab1) and two weak (tab2 and tab3) traa-binding sites in the intergenic region. primer extension analysis implied that the transcriptional initiation sites of traa and ipd were located in the intergenic region. northern analysis showed that cpd1 upregulated and downregulated transcription of ipd and traa, respectively. the circular permutation assay showed that traa bent a dna fragment corresponding to the tab1 region, and its angle was changed in the presence of cpd1 or ipd1. from these data, we propose a model that traa changes the conformation of the tab1 region in response to cpd1 and upregulates the transcription of ipd, which may lead to expression of genes required for the mating response.

TI  == the icest1 element of streptococcus thermophilus belongs to a large family of integrative and conjugative elements that exchange modules and change their specificity of integration.
AB  == the 34,734-bp element icest1 from streptococcus thermophilus cnrz368 is site-specifically integrated into the 3(') end of the gene fda. icest1 encodes integrative functions and putative transfer functions. six proteins of the putative conjugative system of icest1 are related to those encoded by the conjugative transposon tn916 from enterococcus faecalis. a comparison of these proteins with those encoded by the complete or partial genome sequences of various low g+c bacteria including bacillus subtilis, clostridium difficile, e. faecalis, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus mutans revealed the presence of numerous putative site-specific integrative conjugative  elements and/or conjugative transposons within these genomes. sequence comparisons revealed that these elements possess a modular structure and that exchanges of unrelated or distantly related modules and genes have occurred between these elements, and also plasmids and prophages. these exchanges have probably led to modifications in the site specificity of integration of these elements. therefore, a distinction between low specificity integrative conjugative elements (i.e., conjugative transposons) and site-specific integrative conjugative elements does not appear to be relevant. we propose to call all the conjugative elements that excise by site-specific recombination and  integrate by recombination between a specific site of a circular intermediate and another site, "integrative and conjugative elements" (ices), irrespective of the  integration specificity.

TI  == proteinases of common pathogenic bacteria degrade and inactivate the antibacterial peptide ll-37.
AB  == effectors of the innate immune system, the anti-bacterial peptides, have pivotal  roles in preventing infection at epithelial surfaces. here we show that proteinases of the significant human pathogens pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis and streptococcus pyogenes, degrade the  antibacterial peptide ll-37. analysis by mass spectrometry of fragments generated by p. aeruginosa elastase in vitro revealed that the initial cleavages occurred at asn-leu and asp-phe, followed by two breaks at arg-ile, thus inactivating the  peptide. proteinases of the other pathogens also degraded ll-37 as determined by  sds-page. ex vivo, p. aeruginosa elastase induced ll-37 degradation in human wound fluid, leading to enhanced bacterial survival. the degradation was blocked  by the metalloproteinase inhibitors gm6001 and 1, 10-phenantroline (both of which inhibited p. aeruginosa elastase, p. mirabilis proteinase, and e. faecalis gelatinase), or the inhibitor e64 (which inhibited s. pyogenes cysteine proteinase). additional experiments demonstrated that dermatan sulphate and disaccharides of the structure [deltaua(2s)-galnac(4,6s)], or sucroseoctasulphate, inhibited the degradation of ll-37. the results indicate that proteolytic degradation of ll-37 is a common virulence mechanism and that molecules which block this degradation could have therapeutic potential.

TI  == bacterial adhesins--their role in tubule invasion and endodontic disease.
AB  == bacterial invasion of dentinal tubules is critical to the progression of dental caries and the development of pulp and periapical disease, and may also influence the progression of periodontal disease. however, little is known about the host or bacterial mechanisms involved in tubule invasion. recent work has demonstrated that bacterial interactions with dentine, and salivary and tissue molecules influence invasion. salivary molecules such as mucin and immunoglobulin g (igg) co-aggregate with bacterial cells, which inhibits dentine invasion, while deposition of dentinal tubule fluid molecules e.g. albumin, igg, or fibrinogen within dentinal tubules also inhibits invasion. dentine invasion by streptococci  has been shown to be associated with a bacterial growth response and adhesion to  unmineralized collagen, which are mediated by streptococcal cell-surface antigen  i/ii polypeptides. these adhesins possess diverse binding properties including binding to salivary glycoprotein, other bacteria, and to collagen. additionally,  some antigen i/ii polypeptides facilitate species-specific co-invasion between streptococci and obligate anaerobes that lack the ability to invade by themselves. an understanding of the mechanisms involved in bacterial invasion of  dentine should allow development of new control strategies.

AB  == gram positive bacteria are frequently emerging as antibiotic resistant pathogens, causing serious infections than ever before in the ill and debilitated patients.  the pattern of isolation and the antimicrobial susceptibilities of common gram positive cocci including staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococcus (cons), streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus species and streptococcus pneumoniae was investigated between january 1997 and june 2000 in jimma hospital. of the 500 specimens collected from children and adults, 116 (23.2%) consisted of one or more of the above organisms. the following strains: staphylococcus aureus, 47 (40.5%), cons, 36 (31.0%), streptococcus pneumoniae, 26 (22.4%) streptococcus pyogenes, 5 (4.3%) and streptococcus faecalis, 2(1.7%) were isolated from different specimens including pus, sputum, urine, stool, blood and oro/nasopharyngeal swabs of patients. the in vitro activities of 14 different antibiotics including penicillin g, ampicillin, cloxacillin, cephalothin, gentamicin, kanamycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, streptomycin, methicillin, vancomycin and clindamycin was determined against the clinical bacterial isolates. the antimicrobial activities were evaluated by agar diffusion technique using mueller-hinton agar according to nccls recommendations. the majority of the pathogens, 59(50.9%) were recovered from upper respiratory tract infections and 17 (14.6%) from the lower respiratory tract. the resistance patterns of s. aureus, cons, s. pneumoniae and enterococci to penicillin was 91.5%, 94.4%, 7.7%  and 100% respectively. penicillin, ampicillin and cloxacillin showed low effects  (< 60%) on both s. aureus and cons. multi-drug resistance was observed in all the gram-positive isolates, especially higher in staphylococcus species. all isolates of s. aureus (100%) were susceptible to vancomycin, clindamycin and gentamicin. in order to reduce morbidity and mortality due to antibiotic resistance susceptibility testing should be performed for the proper management of bacterial infections. this entails the need for national surveillance to monitor antibiotic resistance in bacteria by susceptibility testing using reliable methods.

TI  == [interpretative reading of the antibiogram in gram-positive cocci].
AB  == resistance to methicillin in staphylococcus is related to expression of the gene  meca, and implies resistance to all beta-lactams. breakpoints for interpretation  of this mechanism differ in s. aureus and in coagulase-negative species. in relation to macrolides-lincosamides-streptograminsb, the most frequent mechanism  among resistant strains is expression of methylases (erm genes). topoisomerase changes caused by point mutations and expression of the efflux pump nora determine resistance to quinolones, but there are great differences on the activity of different compounds, which makes interpretative reading difficult. strains of s. aureus with intermediate susceptibility to glycopeptides (gisa strains) have been recently described. in spain, there is a high percentage of s. pneumoniae strains intermediate or resistant to penicillin, and a low percentage  of strains intermediate or resistant to third generation cephalosporins, because  of mutations in genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins. the most frequent phenotype of resistance to macrolides in this species is caused by methylase production. resistance to quinolones is still uncommon, and is related to the mechanisms previously indicated for staphylococcus, but clinical interpretation of the antibiograma for this organism is even more complex. no strains of s. pyogenes resistant to penicillin have yet been described. in spain the most common phenotype of resistance to macrolides in s. pyogenes is determined by efflux pumps (mef genes), affecting 14- and 15-membered macrolides. e. faecalis is usually susceptible to ampicillin, in contrast to e. faecium. enterococci show intrinsic resistance to aminoglycosides, but still remain susceptible to the combination of these antimicrobials and cell-wall active agents. strains expressing different aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes became resistant to the combination. glycopeptide-resistant strains of enterococci are uncommon in our country, but several genotypes, of which vana is the most relevant from a clinical point of view, have been described in other regions.

AB  == bacterial enoyl-acyl carrier protein (acp) reductase (fabi) catalyzes the final step in each elongation cycle of bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis and is an attractive target for the development of new antibacterial agents. high-throughput screening of the staphylococcus aureus fabi enzyme identified a novel, weak inhibitor with no detectable antibacterial activity against s. aureus. iterative medicinal chemistry and x-ray crystal structure-based design led to the identification of compound 4 [(e)-n-methyl-n-(2-methyl-1h-indol-3-ylmethyl)-3-(7-oxo-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-1,8-na phthyridin-3-yl)acrylamide], which is 350-fold more potent than the original lead compound obtained by high-throughput screening in the fabi inhibition assay. compound 4 has exquisite antistaphylococci activity, achieving mics at which 90%  of isolates are inhibited more than 500 times lower than those of nine currently  available antibiotics against a panel of multidrug-resistant strains of s. aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. furthermore, compound 4 exhibits excellent in vivo efficacy in an s. aureus infection model in rats. biochemical and genetic approaches have confirmed that the mode of antibacterial action of compound 4 and related compounds is via inhibition of fabi. compound 4 also exhibits weak fabk inhibitory activity, which may explain its antibacterial activity against streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis, which depend on fabk and both fabk and fabi, respectively, for their enoyl-acp reductase function. these results show that compound 4 is representative of a new, totally synthetic series of antibacterial agents that has the potential to provide novel alternatives for  the treatment of s. aureus infections that are resistant to our present armory of antibiotics.

TI  == the antibacterial activity of topical retinoids: the case of retinaldehyde.
AB  == background: retinoids such as retinoic acid (ra), retinol (rol) and retinaldehyde (ral) are currently used in many formulations and indications ranging form acne to skin aging. most if not all their pharmacological activities occur through binding to nuclear receptors with subsequent modulation of the activities of several genes. little attention has been given to the many other potential actions on the surface of the skin. aim: to analyse the potential anti-infective  activities of topical rol, ral and ra. methods: microbial minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of rol, ral and ra were determined by a microdilution method on reference strains including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, micrococcus flavus, propionibacterium acnes, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus hominis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans and 133 clinical strains including methicillin-resistant s. aureus, methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, streptococcus group b, enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis, vancomycin-resistant e. faecium and pseudomonas/klebsiella. in two clinical trials in healthy human volunteers, skin bacterial densities were evaluated in samples obtained with the cylinder scrub method: (1). 2 and 5 h after a single application of 0.05% ral or vehicle on the forearm and (2). in a single-blind randomized study where 0.05% ral or vehicle were applied daily for 2 weeks on the forehead of 22 volunteers. paired results from treated (or vehicle) and untreated areas were analysed. results: of the three retinoids tested, only ral showed a significant in vitro antibacterial activity; this activity was found against reference strains of gram-positive bacteria like s. aeureus, micrococcus spp. or  p. acnes. no activity was found against gram-negative bacteria. these results on  reference strains were confirmed on 133 clinical isolates. mic(50) and mic(90) values for ral were 8 and 16 mg/l, respectively, for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus and 4 and 8 mg/l for methicillin-resistant s. aureus. the two in vivo studies showed that areas treated with ral had a significant decrease in the bacterial counts. in the forehead study, the median decrease was 10(2) log/cm(2)  for p. acnes and 10(1.8) log/cm(2) for staphylococci. no resistant bacteria were  found after 2 weeks of topical use. preliminary results suggest that the antibacterial effect of ral is due, in part, to the aldehyde group in the lateral chain, since non-retinoid pseudo-analogues of the chain, like citral and hexenal, showed a similar antibacterial activity. conclusion: we have shown that ral differs from parent natural retinoids such as rol and ra in demonstrating significant antibacterial activities upon topical use. this activity is likely due to the aldehyde group in the isoprenoic lateral chain, which illustrates the  potential bifunctional properties of some retinoids.

AB  == the natural dipeptide antibiotic tan 1057 a,b displays excellent antibacterial activity against staphylococci including methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus. however, the in vitro activity against additional gram-positive strains,  in particular pneumococci and enterococcus faecalis, proved to be considerably lower. we report the synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of new derivatives  of this natural product that displayed increased antibacterial potency against staphylococci and were also active against pneumococci. in particular, the analogues bearing modified beta-homoarginine side chains with methylated guanidine moieties were shown to be significantly more potent than the natural product tan 1057 a,b.

TI  == cholesterol assimilation by lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria isolated from the human gut.
AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of human gut-derived lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria on cholesterol levels in vitro. continuous cultures inoculated with fecal material from healthy human volunteers  with media supplemented with cholesterol and bile acids were used to enrich for potential cholesterol assimilators among the indigenous bacterial populations. seven potential probiotics were found: lactobacillus fermentum strains f53 and kc5b, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, streptococcus bovis atcc 43143, enterococcus durans dsm 20633, enterococcus gallinarum, and enterococcus faecalis. a comparative evaluation regarding the in vitro cholesterol reduction abilities of these strains along with commercial probiotics was undertaken. the degree of acid and bile tolerance of strains was also evaluated. the human isolate l. fermentum kc5b was able to maintain viability for 2 h at ph 2 and to grow in a medium with 4,000 mg of bile acids per liter. this strain was also able to remove a maximum of 14.8 mg of cholesterol per g (dry weight) of cells from the culture medium and therefore was regarded as a candidate probiotic.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of dw286, a new fluoronaphthyridone antibiotic.
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo activities of dw286, a novel fluoronaphthyridone with potent antibacterial activity, were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, gemifloxacin, sparfloxacin, and trovafloxacin. against gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis, the in vitro activity of dw286 was stronger than that of any other reference antibiotic. against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of dw286 was similar to those of trovafloxacin and gemifloxacin but was weaker than that of ciprofloxacin. in a mouse systemic infection caused by three s. aureus strains, including methicillin-resistant s. aureus and quinolone-resistant s. aureus (qrsa), dw286 demonstrated the most potent activity, as found in vitro. specially, dw286 is >or=8-fold more active against qrsa than the other fluoroquinolones. and the 50% protective doses for dw286 were correspondent with the in vitro activities.

AB  == the microbiota of the lower female genital tract was evaluated from vaginal swabs obtained from 623 healthy pregnant women at gestation periods of 35-40 weeks. isolated and identified microorganisms were expressed as percentages of total samples. as expected, lactobacilli made up the dominant vaginal microbiota (70%). enterobacteriaceae, mainly escherichia coli, klebsiella spp. and proteus, were present in 38% of the samples, which might reflect the possible contamination of  vaginal tract with rectal microorganisms. candida albicans was present in 10% of  healthy pregnant woman assayed. streptoccocci (streptococcus sp. and enterococcus faecalis with 3% and 4%, respectively) and other gram-positive cocci (staphylococcus sp., 5%), along with other microorgansisms such as gardnerella vaginalis (5%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (2%) may represent a potential infection risk. streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococci beta-hemolytic, gbs) was detected in 7% of the samples. gbs infection is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality in the developed world. furthermore, gbs was often co-isolated with c. albicans (54.5%) in the samples. a complete and detailed evaluation of the vaginal biota swab, with particular attention to the presence of potential pathogens such as gbs, is a preventive strategy that can provide useful information to obstetricians and gynecologist in managing the last days of pregnancy and delivery.

AB  == azd2563 is a new oxazolidinone that has targeted activity against gram-positive bacteria. the in vitro activity of azd2563 and nine comparators against 1543 european enterococcal, staphylococcal and streptococcal isolates was determined.  the compound is a potent oxazolidinone, with no isolate tested displaying an mic  > 4 mg/l and 94.4% having an mic < or =2 mg/l. compared with linezolid, the distribution of mics for all species of bacteria tested, with the exception of enterococcus faecium, was shifted by one or two dilution steps to lower values for azd2563. thus, this oxazolidinone is a promising new antibiotic for the treatment of infections with gram-positive cocci.

TI  == the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase motif is lacking in pmpa, the prsa-like protein involved in the secretion machinery of lactococcus lactis.
AB  == the prsa-like gene from lactococcus lactis encoding its single homologue to prsa, an essential protein triggering the folding of secreted proteins in bacillus subtilis, was characterized. this gene, annotated pmpa, encodes a lipoprotein of  309 residues whose expression is increased 7- to 10-fold when the source of nitrogen is limited. a slight increase in the expression of the prsa-like protein (plp) in l. lactis removed the degradation products previously observed with the  staphylococcus hyicus lipase used as a model secreted protein. this shows that pmpa either triggers the folding of the secreted lipase or activates its degradation by the cell surface protease htra. unlike the case for b. subtilis, the inactivation of the gene encoding pmpa reduced only slightly the growth rate  of l. lactis in standard conditions. however, it almost stopped its growth when the lipase was overexpressed in the presence of salt in the medium. like prsa of  b. subtilis and prtm of l. lactis, the l. lactis pmpa protein could thus have a foldase activity that facilitates protein secretion. these proteins belong to the third family of peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-isomerases (ppiases) for which parvulin is the prototype. almost all plp from gram-positive bacteria contain a domain with the ppiase signature. an exception to this situation was found only in streptococcaceae, the family to which l. lactis belongs. plp from streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis possess this signature, but those of l. lactis, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus mutans do not. however, secondary structure predictions suggest that the folding of plp is conserved over the entire length of the proteins, including the unconserved signature region. the activity associated with the expression of pmpa in l. lactis and these genomic data show that either the ppiase motif is not necessary for ppiase activity or, more likely, pmpa foldase activity does not necessarily require ppiase activity.

AB  == the antibiotic and chlorhexidine (chx) susceptibility of 70 distinct clinical isolates: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus (not mrsa), streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis (10 of each) were tested using minimal bactericidal (mbc) and/or minimal inhibitory (mic) concentrations. non-fermentative bacteria tolerated chx at high concentrations; gram-positive cocci, especially s. pyogenes, were the most susceptible. we found a good correlation between chx and  antibiotic susceptibility in both mic and mbc among gram-negative bacteria, and mainly in mbc among gram-positive bacteria. resistance to ciprofloxacin, imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin and aztreonam appeared to indicate  increased chx resistance among gram-negative bacteria. this finding gives clinicians the ability to predict chx susceptibility according to routine antibiotic resistance testing.

TI  == source of enterococci in a farmhouse raw-milk cheese.
AB  == enterococci are widely distributed in raw-milk cheeses and are generally thought  to positively affect flavor development. their natural habitats are the human and animal intestinal tracts, but they are also found in soil, on plants, and in the  intestines of insects and birds. the source of enterococci in raw-milk cheese is  unknown. in the present study, an epidemiological approach with pulsed-field gel  electrophoresis (pfge) was used to type 646 enterococcus strains which were isolated from a cheddar-type cheese, the milk it was made from, the feces of cows and humans associated with the cheese-making unit, and the environment, including the milking equipment, the water used on the farm, and the cows' teats. nine different pfge patterns, three of enterococcus casseliflavus, five of enterococcus faecalis, and one of enterococcus durans, were found. the same three clones, one of e. faecalis and two of e. casseliflavus, dominated almost all of the milk, cheese, and human fecal samples. the two e. casseliflavus clones were also found in the bulk tank and the milking machine even after chlorination, suggesting that a niche where enterococci could grow was present and that contamination with enterococci begins with the milking equipment. it is likely but unproven that the enterococci present in the human feces are due to consumption of the cheese. cow feces were not considered the source of enterococci in the cheese, as enterococcus faecium and streptococcus bovis, which largely dominated the cows' intestinal tracts, were not found in either the milk  or the cheese.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and  penicillins. fifteen species, 1,062 strains, of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa; n = 127), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa; n = 123), staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 104), staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 58), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 100), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 50), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 125), enterococcus faecalis (n = 150), enterococcus faecium (n = 50), enterococcus avium (n = 50), and peptostreptococcus spp. (p. anaerobius, p. asaccharolyticus, p. magnus, p. micros, p. prevotii; n = 125). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 5 years. the mic90 of czop against mrsa and s. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against s. pneumoniae and peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. however, the mic90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. increases in the mic90 against s. pneumoniae were also observed with cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), flomoxef (fmox), sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz), and imipenem (ipm). increases in the mic90 against peptostreptococcus spp. were also  observed with ceftazidime (caz), cpr, cfpm, fmox, sbt/cpz, and ipm. the decreases in the sensitivities were not always considered to depend upon generation of resistant bacteria because the annual mic range of each antibacterial agent was almost generally wide every year and the annual sensitivity of each strain to the agents extremely varied. in conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. it, therefore, was suggested that czop had maintained high antibacterial activity during 5 years of post-marketing.

TI  == role of the streptococcus gordonii sspb protein in the development of porphyromonas gingivalis biofilms on streptococcal substrates.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is an aggressive periodontal pathogen that persists in the mixed-species plaque biofilm on tooth surfaces. p. gingivalis cells attach to the plaque commensal streptococcus gordonii and this coadhesion event leads to the development of p. gingivalis biofilms. binding of these organisms is multimodal, involving both the p. gingivalis major fimbrial fima protein and the  species-specific interaction of the minor fimbrial mfa1 protein with the streptococcal sspb protein. this study examined the contribution of the mfa1-sspb interaction to p. gingivalis biofilm formation. p. gingivalis biofilms readily formed on substrata of s. gordonii dl1 but not on streptococcus mutans cells which lack a coadhesion-mediating homologue of sspb. an insertional inactivation  of the mfa1 gene in p. gingivalis resulted in a phenotype deficient in s. gordonii binding and unable to form biofilms. furthermore, analysis using recombinant streptococci and enterococci showed that p. gingivalis biofilms formed on enterococcus faecalis strains expressing sspb or translational fusions  of sspb with spap (the non-adherent sspb homologue in s. mutans) containing the p. gingivalis adherence domain (sspb adherence region, bar) of sspb. in contrast, an isogenic ssp null mutant of s. gordonii dl1 was unable to support biofilm growth, even though this strain bound to p. gingivalis fima at levels similar to  wild-type s. gordonii dl1. finally, site-specific mutation of two functional amino acid residues in bar resulted in sspb polypeptides that did not promote the development of p. gingivalis biofilms. these results suggest that the induction of p. gingivalis biofilms on a streptococcal substrate requires functional sspb-minor fimbriae interactions.

TI  == a multicenter evaluation of linezolid antimicrobial activity in north america.
AB  == overall, 141 centers in north america enrolled in this international surveillance study designed to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity and spectrum of linezolid, a new oxazolidinone. each participant tested the susceptibility of clinical isolates of staphylococcal species (n = 85) against 12 drugs, and enterococcal species (n = 40) against 6 drugs using reference broth microdilution trays; and of streptococcal species (n = 25) against 6 drugs using etests (ab biodisk, solna, sweden). quality control testing was conducted using recommended  strains, and verification of resistance to linezolid and select other agents was  performed by a regional monitor. of the 20,161 isolates collected from sites across the united states (us; n = 132) and canada (n = 9), 18,307 were included in this analysis. oxacillin resistance occurred in 38.7 and 70.6% of staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcal (cons) isolates, respectively. vancomycin resistance was reported in 65.9 and 2.6% of enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis, respectively. penicillin resistance occurred in 37.2% of streptococcus pneumoniae, 17.5% constituting high-level resistance (mic, > or =2  microg/ml). the mic(90) for linezolid was 1 microg/ml for streptococci, 2 microg/ml for enterococci and cons isolates, and 4 microg/ml for s. aureus. using the us fda-recommended susceptible breakpoints for linezolid, there were no confirmed reports of linezolid resistance (i.e., mic > or =8 microg/ml). the occurrence of linezolid mics was unimodal and generally varied between, 1-4 microg/ml for staphylococci (94% of recorded results), 1-2 microg/ml for enterococci (93%), and 0.5-1 microg/ml for streptococci (85%). susceptibility to  linezolid was not influenced by susceptibility to other antiicrobials such as vancomycin, beta-lactams or macrolides. only linezolid was universally active against essentially all tested gram-positive specimens. the unimodal susceptibility pattern is indicative of excellent and near complete activity against key gram-positive pathogens including multiply resistant strains, but surveillance for emerging resistances (rare) and the performance of routine susceptibility tests to guide patient therapy seems prudent.

AB  == the sex pheromone cam373 of enterococcus faecalis and the related staph-cam373 of staphylococcus aureus were found to correspond to heptapeptides located within the c-termini of the signal sequences of putative prelipoproteins. the deduced mature forms of the lipoproteins share no detectable homology and presumably serve unrelated functions in the cells. the chromosomally encoded genetic determinants for production of the pheromones have been identified and designated came (encoding cam373) and cams (encoding staph-cam373). truncated and full-length clones of came were generated in escherichia coli, in which cam373 activity was expressed. in e. faecalis, insertional inactivation in the middle of came had no detectable phenotypic effects on the pheromone system. establishment  of an in frame translation stop codon within the signal sequence resulted in reduction of cam373 activity to 3% of normal levels. the cams determinant has homologues in staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis and listeria monocytogenes; however, corresponding heptapeptides present within those sequences do not resemble staph-cam373 closely. the particular significance of staph-cam373 as a potential intergeneric inducer of transfer-proficient genetic elements is discussed.

AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. changes in the bacterial sensitivity for czop were  also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint mic. sixteen  species (1,913 strains) of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa; n = 178), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa; n = 199), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse; n = 98), methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis (mrse; n = 164), staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 72), staphylococcus saprophyticus (n = 28), enterococcus faecalis (n = 206), enterococcus faecium (n  = 91), enterococcus avium (n = 72), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 133), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 138), penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp; n = 133), penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp; n = 100), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp; n = 29), streptococcus milleri group (n = 135) and peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 137). czop possessed comparable antibacterial activities against mssa and msse to other cephems, and was also effective on mrse but not on mrsa. an antibacterial activity of czop against s. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than other cephems. czop, however, did not indicate an antibacterial activity against s. haemolyticus, just like other cephems. an antibacterial activity of czop against e. faecalis was comparable to cefpirome (cpr) and higher than other cephems. no antibacterial activity of czop against e. faecium and e. avium was observed, just like other drugs. an antibacterial activity of czop against s. pyogenes was as potent as that of cefotiam (ctm), cefepime (cfpm) and cpr, and that against s. agalactiae was also preferable. czop and other cephems also had a preferable antibacterial activity against s. milleri group that was most sensitive to benzylpenicillin. an antibacterial activity of czop against peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than that of cefazolin, ctm and cefmetazole. the resistance ratio estimated with breakpoint mic of czop was 96.5% in mrsa, 93.1% in prsp, 60.0% in  pisp, 40.3% in s. haemolyticus, 22.3% in e. faecalis, and 15.9% in mrse. those resistance ratios were similar to those for cfpm, but e. faecalis showed 90.8% resistance for cfpm. the difference in the resistance ratio of e. faecalis demonstrated that czop successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against this species. in conclusion, no remarkable annual change in the antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria was observed. the sensitivities of pisp and prsp to czop, however, was suggested to be decreasing.

TI  == nb2001, a novel antibacterial agent with broad-spectrum activity and enhanced potency against beta-lactamase-producing strains.
AB  == enzyme-catalyzed therapeutic activation (ecta) is a novel prodrug strategy to overcome drug resistance resulting from enzyme overexpression. beta-lactamase overexpression is a common mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. we present here the results for one of the beta-lactamase ecta compounds, nb2001, which consists of the antibacterial agent triclosan in a prodrug form with a cephalosporin scaffold. unlike conventional beta-lactam antibiotics, where hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring inactivates the antibiotic, hydrolysis of nb2001 by beta-lactamase releases triclosan. evidence supporting the proposed mechanism is as follows. (i) nb2001 is a substrate for tem-1 beta-lactamase, forming triclosan with a second-order rate constant (k(cat)/k(m)) of greater than 77,000 m-1 s-1. (ii) triclosan is detected in nb2001-treated, beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli but not in e. coli that does not express beta-lactamase. (iii) nb2001 activity against beta-lactamase-producing e. coli is decreased in the presence of the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. nb2001 was similar to or more potent than reference antibiotics against clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (including mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae. nb2001 is also active against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae.  the results indicate that nb2001 is a potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent  and demonstrate the potential of ecta in overcoming beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.

TI  == [four cases of non-clostridial gas gangrene with diabetes mellitus].
AB  == we report four cases of non-clostridial gas gangrene. all cases were associated with diabetes mellitus as the underlying disease. case 1: a 60-year-old male developed an ulcerative lesion on the dorsum of his left foot. peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, citrobacter freundii and staphyrococcus epidermidis were identified in culture from odoriferous pus. case 2: a 81-year-old female developed a lesion on her vulva spreading to the right lower abdomen. bacteroides bivius, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus and streptococcus faecalis were identified in culture of the odoriferous pus. case 3: a 80-year-old male developed a swollen area with ulcer on the right foot. bacteroides fragiris, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus avium and enterococcus faecalis were identified by culture. case 4: a 52-year-old female developed swelling of her left groin. enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus anginosus were identified in culture from the odoriferous pus. in all patients, a radiological examination revealed the presence of subcutaneous gas in the lesion. prognosis of non-clostridial gas gangrene is usually poor. these four patients, however, all survived. once an infectious sign is seen in the diabetic patient, it is important to discover a gas figure by using the radiological examination (plain film or computed tomography). earlier diagnosis and debridement are the most important for a better prognosis. because workers with diabetes mellitus are now increasing in number, occupational physicians should always keep in mind that a serious infectious disease like non-clostridial gas gangrene can develop even from minor accidental trauma, and they should control the working environment in  the workplace where accidents often happen.

TI  == in vitro action of carboxyfullerene.
AB  == fullerene compounds have avid reactivity with free radicals and are regarded as 'radical sponges'. the trimalonic acid derivative of fullerene is one of the water-soluble compounds that has been synthesized and found to be an effective antioxidant both in vivo and in vitro. carboxyfullerene has been shown to be effective in the treatment of both gram-positive and -negative infections, although its mode of action is poorly understood. we determined the mic and minimal bactericidal concentration of carboxyfullerene for 20 isolates, including staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi and klebsiella pneumoniae. we further investigated the action of carboxyfullerene using transmission electron microscopy (tem), anticarboxyfullerene antibody binding assay and a membrane perturbation assay. all gram-positive species were inhibited by < or = 50 mg/l of carboxyfullerene, whereas gram-negative species were not inhibited, even at 500 mg/l carboxyfullerene. bactericidal activity was demonstrated only for gram-positive species, particularly for streptococcus pyogenes a-20, which was killed rapidly. intercalation of carboxyfullerene into the cell wall of staphylococci and streptococci was demonstrated by tem and anti-carboxyfullerene  binding assay. damage to the cell membrane in gram-positive, but not gram-negative, bacteria was confirmed by the membrane perturbation assay. these findings indicate that the action of carboxyfullerene on gram-positive bacteria is achieved by insertion into the cell wall and destruction of membrane integrity.

TI  == the potential of a polyphasic pcr-dgge approach in evaluating microbial diversity of natural whey cultures for water-buffalo mozzarella cheese production: bias of  culture-dependent and culture-independent analyses.
AB  == a polyphasic pcr-dgge approach was used to describe the microbial population occurring in natural whey cultures (nwcs) for water-buffalo mozzarella cheese production. total microbial community was assessed without cultivation by analyzing dna directly extracted from the original samples of nwc. in addition, dna extracted from bulks of cells formed by harvesting colonies from the serial dilution agar plates of a variety of culture media was used to profile the "cultivable" community. the 16s rdna v3 region was amplified using dna from nwc as well as dna from bulks as templates and the amplicons were separated by dgge.  the microbial entities occurring in nwcs were identified by partial 16s rdna sequencing of dgge bands: four lactic acid bacteria (lab) closest relative of streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii and lactobacillus crispatus were revealed by the analysis of dna directly extracted from nwc while two other lab, lactobacillus fermentum and enterococcus faecalis,  were identified by analyzing dna from the cultivable community. the developed pcr-dgge analysis of the "cultivable" community showed good potential in evaluating microbial diversity of a dairy environment: it usefully highlighted the bias introduced by selective amplification when compared to the analysis of the total community from nwc and allowed suitability of media and growth conditions to be evaluated. moreover, it could be used to complete the culture independent study of microbial diversity to give information on concentration ratios among species occurring in a particular environment and can be proposed for rapid identification of dominant microorganisms in alternative to traditional tools.

TI  == grepafloxacin: pharmacokinetics and tissue penetration.
AB  == pharmacokinetic and tissue penetration studies of grepafloxacin, a new broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone, show that it has useful properties for the treatment of respiratory tract infections. grepafloxacin has a volume of distribution that is larger than those of many of the other fluoroquinolones and  is concentrated in alveolar macrophages, bronchial mucosa and epithelial lining fluid to a greater extent than are certain other fluoroquinolones. grepafloxacin  concentrations achieved in plasma after a 400-mg oral dose are well in excess of  those required to inhibit the respiratory pathogens staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis. streptococcus pneumoniae is also covered for most of the dosing interval, but at normal dose levels grepafloxacin might not inhibit enterococcus faecalis. the maximum plasma concentrations and area under the concentration---time curve achieved with grepafloxacin suggest that it will be effective for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. the pharmacokinetics of fluoroquinolones are among their most useful properties. the  aim of this paper is to demonstrate whether the differences between grepafloxacin and the other fluoroquinolones are of therapeutic significance.

AB  == bacterial invasion of dentinal tubules is a critical step in the pathogenesis of  dental caries and pulp and periapical disease. the purpose of this study was to determine the effect some molecules commonly found in saliva and dentinal tubule  fluid may have on the bacterial invasion of dentine. the results showed that invasion of streptococcus gordonii or enterococcus faecalis cells was inhibited when the bacterial cells were in solution with mucin, immunoglobulin g (igg) and  serum, and this was related to bacterial cell aggregation, as a result of interaction with agglutinins, and/or inhibition of collagen binding. when dentine was soaked in growth media containing fibrinogen, igg, albumin or serum prior to  inoculation, bacterial invasion was inhibited. it is suggested that this may be due to reduced dentine permeability as a consequence of the deposition of the compounds within dentinal tubules.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. special references to bacteria isolated between april 1998  and march 1999].
AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in japan since july 1982. this paper describes the results obtained in fiscal 1998 (from april 1998 to march 1999). the number of cases investigated as objectives was 225 for one year. a total of 429 strains (121 strains from primary infections and 308 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 183 cases (81.3% of total cases). in primary infections, the isolation rates of anaerobes and escherichia coli were higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of gram-positive aerobes and pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than in primary infections. on the whole, among gram-positive aerobes, the isolation rate of enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by staphylococcus aureus with high frequency in isolation from  postoperative infections. among gram-positive anaerobes, peptostreptococcus spp.  and streptococcus spp. were predominantly isolated. among gram-negative aerobes,  e. coli, p. aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae were frequently isolated. among gram-negative anaerobes, bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates. in primary infections, the percentage of gram-negative aerobes has gradually increased since fiscal 1995 or 1996 with these years as the turning point, while those of gram-positive and gram-negative  anaerobes have gradually declined. in postoperative infections, the percentage of gram-negative anaerobes has increased continuously since the mid-1980s. the percentage of mrsa among s. aureus rose to 89.7%, which was the highest level since the beginning of this study. the susceptibilities of b. fragilis, which did not show apparent changes, were recognized to have decreased against cephems in fiscal 1998. among other bacteria in b. fragilis group, development of resistance to cephems has continued on a long-term basis since the mid-1980s. e. coli and k. pneuminiae have obviously not changed in susceptibilities, however, the susceptibilities of isolated strains in fiscal 1998 against high-generation cephems, oxacephems and monobactams have declined. we found neither vancomycin-resistant nor teicoplanin-resistant strains of s. aureus and enterococcus spp.

TI  == comparative antimicrobial activity of gatifloxacin with ciprofloxacin and beta-lactams against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == gatifloxacin is a new 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone. the in-vitro antibacterial activity of gatifloxacin was compared to that of ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, imipenem, piperacillin/tazobactam and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid against 165 streptococcal isolates, 369 staphylococcal isolates, and 50 enterococcal isolates recently recovered from clinical isolates. gatifloxacin was the most active agent tested against streptococci including penicillin-nonsusceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) 0.5 microg/ml). imipenem and gatifloxacin (mic(90) 0.5 microg/ml) were the most active agents tested against viridans group streptococci. all the agents demonstrated excellent activity against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus. imipenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and gatifloxacin had good activity against methicillin-sensitive s. epidermidis. among the methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci tested, gatifloxacin was the most active agent. amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and gatifloxacin were the most active agents against e. faecalis. thus, gatifloxacin possesses equal or superior activity when compared to ciprofloxacin and beta-lactams making it a promising new fluoroquinolone for clinical use in treating gram-positive infections.

TI  == enterococcal endocarditis in sweden, 1995-1999: can shorter therapy with aminoglycosides be used?
AB  == a 5-year nationwide prospective study in sweden during 1995-1999 identified 881 definite episodes of infective endocarditis. definite enterococcal endocarditis was diagnosed in 93 episodes (11%), the largest series of enterococcal endocarditis so far presented. mortality during treatment was 16%, the relapse rate was 3%, and clinical cure was achieved in the remaining 81% of the episodes. clinical cure was achieved with a median duration of cell wall-active antimicrobial therapy of 42 days combined with an aminoglycoside (median treatment time, 15 days). international guidelines generally recommend a 4-6-week combined synergistic treatment course with a cell wall-active antibiotic and an aminoglycoside. treatment regimens in sweden often include a shortened aminoglycoside treatment course in order to minimize adverse effects in older patients. fatal outcome seemed not to be due to the shortened aminoglycoside therapy course. in many enterococcal endocarditis episodes, duration of aminoglycoside therapy could probably be shortened to 2-3 weeks.

TI  == sequence of the 50-kb conjugative multiresistance plasmid pre25 from enterococcus faecalis re25.
AB  == the complete 50,237-bp dna sequence of the conjugative and mobilizing multiresistance plasmid pre25 from enterococcus faecalis re25 was determined. the plasmid had 58 putative open reading frames, 5 of which encode resistance to 12 antimicrobials. chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and the 23s rna methylase are identical to gene products of the broad-host-range plasmid pip501 from streptococcus agalactiae. in addition, a 30.5-kb segment is almost identical to pip501. genes encoding an aminoglycoside 6-adenylyltransferase, a streptothricin  acetyltransferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase are arranged in tandem on a 7.4-kb fragment as previously reported in tn5405 from staphylococcus  aureus and in pjh1 from e. faecalis. one interrupted and five complete is elements as well as three replication genes were also identified. pre25 was transferred by conjugation to e. faecalis, listeria innocua, and lactococcus lactis by means of a transfer region that appears similar to that of pip501. it is concluded that pre25 may contribute to the further spread of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms via food into the human community.

TI  == fractional maximal effect method for in vitro synergy between amoxicillin and ceftriaxone and between vancomycin and ceftriaxone against enterococcus faecalis  and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == in the present study we assessed the use of a new in vitro testing method and graphical representation of the results to investigate the potential effectiveness of combinations of amoxicillin (amz) plus ceftriaxone (cro) and of  cro plus vancomycin (van) against strains of streptococcus pneumoniae highly resistant to penicillin and cephalosporins (prp strains). we used the fractional  maximal effect (fme) method of time-kill curves to calculate adequate concentrations of the drugs to be tested rather than relying on arbitrary choices. the concentrations obtained, each of which corresponded to a fraction of the maximal effect, were tested alone and in combination with the bacterial strains in a broth medium. synergy was defined as a ratio of observed effect/theoretical effect, called fme, of greater than 1, additivity was defined  as an fme equal to 1, and antagonism was defined as an observed effect lower than the best effect of one of the antibiotics used alone. the area between antagonism and additivity is the indifference zone. the well-known synergy between amoxicillin and gentamicin against a reference strain of enterococcus faecalis was confirmed, with a best fme equal to 1.07. two strains of prp, strains prp-1 and prp-2, were studied. the mics for prp-1 and prp-2 were as follows: penicillin, 4 and 16 microg/ml, respectively; amz, 2 and 8 microg/ml, respectively, cro, 1 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; and van, 0.5 and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively. for prp-1 the best fme for the combination amz-cro was 1.22 with drug concentrations of 1.68 mg/liter for amz and 0.17 mg/liter for cro; the best fme for the combination van-cro was 1.75 with van at 0.57 mg/liter and cro at 0.17 mg/liter. for prp-2 the best fme obtained for the combination amz-cro was 1.05 with drug concentrations of 11.28 mg/liter for amz and 0.64 mg/liter for cro; the best fme obtained for the combination van-cro was 1.35 with van at 0.25  mg/liter and cro at 1.49 mg/liter. these results demonstrated the synergy of both combinations, amz-cro and van-cro, against prp strains at drug concentrations achievable in humans. consequently, either of the combinations can be proposed for use for the treatment of prp infections.

(1) uropathogens from hospitalized urological patients (1990/1991) with complicated and/or hospital-acquired utis; urologic clinic, hospital st. elisabeth, straubing. (2) uropathogens from a multi-centre study (1995/1996) comprising 37 urological centres throughout germany. (3) mrsa isolates of patients and staff (1999/2000) within the hospital st. elisabeth, straubing. genotyping of the latter isolates was performed by pulsed-field-electrophoresis. the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of linezolid determined by an agar (isosensitest) dilution method using a multipoint inoculator and an inoculum of 10(4) cfu per point ranged for methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (n=27) between 2 and 4 mg/l, for methicillin resistant s. aureus (mrsa) (n=35) between 1 and 2 mg/l, for methicillin susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) (msse) (n=67) between 0.5 and 4 mg/l, for methicillin resistant cns (mrse) (n=19) between 0.25  and 2 mg/l, for enterococcus. faecalis (n=184) between 0.5 and 4 mg/l, for e. faecium (n=3) 2 mg/l and for streptococcus spp. (n=4) between 0.25 and 1 mg/l, indicating that all strains were susceptible. according to the in vitro activity, linezolid may be considered a promising antibacterial agent for the treatment of  complicated uti caused by gram-positive uropathogens. thus, linezolid should be evaluated in a clinical study.

AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae colonizes the nasopharynx in up to 40% of healthy subjects, and is a leading cause of middle ear infections (otitis media), meningitis and pneumonia. pneumococci adhere to glycosidic receptors on epithelial cells and to immobilized fibronectin, but the bacterial adhesins mediating these reactions are largely uncharacterized. in this report we describe a novel pneumococcal protein pava, which binds fibronectin and is associated with pneumococcal adhesion and virulence. the pava gene, present in 64 independent isolates of s. pneumoniae tested, encodes a 551 amino acid residue polypeptide with 67% identical amino acid sequence to fbp54 protein in streptococcus pyogenes. pava localized to the pneumococcal cell outer surface, as demonstrated  by immunoelectron microscopy, despite lack of conventional secretory or cell-surface anchorage signals within the primary sequence. full-length recombinant pava polypeptide bound to immobilized human fibronectin in preference to fluid-phase fibronectin, in a heparin-sensitive interaction, and blocked binding of wild-type pneumococcal cells to fibronectin. however, a c-terminally truncated pava' polypeptide (362 aa residues) failed to bind fibronectin or block pneumococcal cell adhesion. expression of pava in enterococcus faecalis jh2-2 conferred > sixfold increased cell adhesion levels to fibronectin over control jh2-2 cells. isogenic mutants of s. pneumoniae, either abrogated in pava expression or producing a 42 kda c-terminally truncated protein, showed up to 50% reduced binding to immobilized fibronectin. inactivation of pava had no effects on growth rate, cell morphology, cell-surface physico-chemical properties, production of pneumolysin, autolysin, or surface proteins pspa and psaa. isogenic pava mutants of encapsulated s. pneumoniae d39 were approximately 104-fold attenuated in virulence in the mouse sepsis model. these results provide evidence that pava fibronectin-binding protein plays a direct role in the pathogenesis of  pneumococcal infections.

TI  == lactobacillus agilis is an important component of the pigeon crop flora.
AB  == aims: to examine the presence of lactic acid bacteria (lab: enterococci, streptococci and lactobacilli) in the pigeon crop. methods and results: the crops of 10 pigeons were sampled and inoculated on agar plates for isolation of streptococci, enterococci and lactobacilli. the isolates were identified using tdna-pcr. lactobacillus agilis, a species described in 1981 from municipal sewage, was the dominant component in eight of these pigeon crop sacs. a lactobacillus species related to l. fermentum and l. mucosae but probably not belonging to one of these species was isolated from five birds. three pigeons carried enterococcus cecorum. minor species found were e. columbae, e. faecalis,  e. hirae, l. johnsonii, l. salivarius, and streptococcus gallolyticus. a description is given of the phenotypic characteristics of the l. agilis pigeon strains. conclusions, significance and impact of the study: l. agilis is found to be the main component of the lab flora in the pigeon crop.

TI  == comparison of the methylene blue and toluidine blue photobactericidal efficacy against gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms.
AB  == background and objective: studies on the photobactericidal efficacy of methylene  blue (mb) and toluidine blue (tb) have shown inconsistent results in the literature. this study evaluated the bactericidal efficacy of mb and tb against different bacteria under light and dark conditions to determine the most effective bactericidal dye. study design/materials and methods: suspensions of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, hemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in saline were treated in dark and red laser light conditions in the presence of each dye using an argon pumped-dye and a diode laser emitting light at 630 and 664 nm, respectively. the effect of dye concentration, dark incubation time, the fluence  and intensity of laser light on the destruction of different bacteria were compared. results: both dyes eradicated all examined bacteria under laser light.  the complete photodestruction of microorganisms was reached at tb concentrations  of 1.5-7-fold less than that of mb. conclusion: tb exhibits a greater bactericidal activity than mb against most bacteria in dark and light conditions. mostly, these results are consistent with their respective dye partition coefficients.

TI  == a simple model host for identifying gram-positive virulence factors.
AB  == we demonstrate the use of the nematode caenorhabditis elegans as a facile and inexpensive model host for several gram-positive human bacterial pathogens. enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus, but not bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecium, or streptococcus pyogenes, kill adult c. elegans. focusing our studies on the enterococcal species, we found that both e. faecalis and e. faecium kill c. elegans eggs and hatchlings, although only e. faecalis kills the adults. in the case of adults, a low inoculum of e. faecalis grows to a high titer in the c. elegans intestine, resulting in a persistent infection that cannot be eradicated by prolonged feeding on e. faecium. interestingly, a high titer of e. faecium also accumulates in the nematode gut, but does not affect the longevity of the worms. two e. faecalis virulence-related factors that play an important role in mammalian models of infection, fsr, a putative quorum-sensing system, and cytolysin, are also important for nematode killing. we exploit the apparent parallels between gram-positive infection in simple and more complex organisms by using the nematode to identify an e. faecalis virulence factor, scrb, which is relevant to  mammalian pathogenesis.

TI  == antibacterial activity of traditional australian medicinal plants.
AB  == fifty-six ethanolic extracts of various parts of 39 plants used in traditional australian aboriginal medicine were investigated for their antibacterial activities against four gram-positive (bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes) and four gram-negative (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium) bacterial species. in a plate-hole diffusion assay, 12 extracts inhibited the growth of one or more of the bacteria, with five extracts showing broad spectrum antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria. b. cereus was the most susceptible bacterium, with all 12 extracts displaying activity against this organism. extracts from the leaves of eremophila species (myoporaceae) were the most active, with eremophila duttonii exhibiting the greatest activity (against gram-positive bacteria). the antibacterial effects of  e. duttonii were further investigated by time-course growth assays which showed that significant growth inhibition was observed in cultures incubated in the presence of the extract within 1 h for b. cereus, e. faecalis and s. aureus and 2 h for s. pyogenes.

TI  == determination of enterococcus faecalis groesl full-length sequence and application for species identification.
AB  == amplification of the partial cpn60 (or groel) gene segment has been used for identification of many bacteria, including enterococcus species. to obtain more sequence data from groesl genes of enterococcus faecalis, the full-length sequence of the e. faecalis groesl genes containing groes (285 bp), spacer (57 bp), and groel (1,626 bp) was determined. a database search of genbank revealed that the deduced e. faecalis groes and groel proteins show significant homology to the groes and groel proteins of other bacteria. the groel (groel) of e. faecalis had the highest identity with streptococcus pneumoniae (81.8% amino acid sequence identity and 73.0% nucleotide sequence identity), followed by lactococcus zeae, while groes (groes) had 60.2% (64.6%) identity with lactobacillus zeae and 58.5% (66.2%) identity with lactococcus lactis, followed by 57.0% (65.5%) identity with bacillus subtilis. based on the groes sequence, an e. faecalis-specific pcr assay was developed, and this pcr assay was positive for all the e. faecalis strains tested. dot blot hybridization using either groes or  groel as the probe distinguished e. faecalis clearly from other species, indicating that both genes can be used as suitable targets for e. faecalis identification. moreover, broad-range pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism of groesl was designed to differentiate eight commonly encountered enterococcus species. the enterococcus species of reference strains could be easily differentiated on the basis of restriction patterns produced by haeiii and rsai. the dna-based assays developed in this study provide an alternative to currently used methods of identification for clinically important enterococcal species.

TI  == multi-resistance to antimicrobial agents for the ten most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens.
AB  == cross-resistance and multi-resistance to selected antibiotics was determined for  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis. amikacin-resistant enterobacteriaceae often showed cross-resistance  to ss-lactam antibiotics. only 1% of the escherichia coli isolates showed resistance to more than four antibiotics from a set of seven. this rate was higher for other enterobacteriaceae and there were high levels of cross-resistance for p. aeruginosa. the cross-resistance of oxacillin with other  antibiotics is well known in staphylococci. penicillin-resistant pneumococcal isolates were cross-resistant to macrolides. cross-resistance was only a minor problem in h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis. cross- and multi-resistance are important problems for gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria but not for fastidious bacteria with the exception of penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae.

TI  == discrete protein determinant directs the species-specific adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis to oral streptococci.
AB  == for pathogens to survive in the human oral cavity, they must identify a suitable  niche in the complex multispecies biofilm that exists on oral tissues. the periodontal pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis adheres to streptococcus gordonii by interacting with a specific region of the streptococcal sspb polypeptide, designated bar. however, it does not adhere to streptococcus mutans, which expresses spap, a highly conserved homolog of sspb. comparison of the predicted secondary structure of bar with the corresponding region of spap suggested that the substitution of asn for gly1182 and val for pro1185 in sspb may confer a unique local structure that is not conserved in spap. a synthetic peptide of 26 amino acids that encompassed residues 1167 to 1193 of sspb promoted avid adherence of p. gingivalis, whereas a peptide derived from the region corresponding to bar in spap was inactive. substitution of gly1182 and pro1185 for asn1182 and val1185 in sspb by site-specific mutation generated proteins that were predicted to assume an spap-like secondary structure, and the purified proteins did not promote p. gingivalis adherence. furthermore, enterococcus faecalis strains expressing the site-specific mutants did not support adherence of p. gingivalis cells. in contrast, p. gingivalis adhered efficiently to e. faecalis strains expressing intact sspb or sspb-spap chimeric proteins containing bar. these results suggest that a region of sspb consisting of 26 amino acids is  sufficient to mediate the adherence of p. gingivalis to s. gordonii and that the  species specificity of adherence arises from its interaction with a discrete structural determinant of sspb that is not conserved in spap.

TI  == conserved degp protease in gram-positive bacteria is essential for thermal and oxidative tolerance and full virulence in streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the degp protease, a multifunctional chaperone and protease, has been shown to be essential for virulence in gram-negative pathogens such as salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, brucella abortus, yersinia enterocolitica, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the function of degp in pathogenesis appears to be the degradation of damaged proteins that accumulate as a result of the initial host response to infection, which includes the release of reactive oxygen intermediates. additionally, the degp protease plays a major role in monitoring and maintaining  the escherichia coli periplasm and influences e. coli pilus biogenesis. we report here the identification of highly homologous enzymes in streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the phenotype of an insertionally inactivated degp allele in s. pyogenes is similar to that reported for e. coli, with temperature sensitivity for growth and enhanced sensitivity to reactive oxygen intermediates. virulence studies in a mouse model of streptococcal infection indicate that a functional degp protease is required for full virulence. these results suggest degp as an attractive broad-spectrum target for future anti-infective drug development.

AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to identify a possible mechanism that would explain how e. faecalis could survive and grow within dentinal tubules and reinfect an obturated root canal. methodology: cells of streptococcus gordonii dl1, streptococcus mutans ng8, or e. faecalis jh2-2 were grown in brain heart infusion broth containing various amounts of human serum for 56 days. the ability of the three species to invade dentine and bind to immobilized type i collagen in the presence of human serum was assessed by dentine invasion and microtitre well  experiments. results: all three species remained viable over the period of the experiment when grown in human serum. cells of all three bacteria were able to invade dentine and bind to immobilized collagen. both of these properties were inhibited by the presence of collagen in the cell solution. human serum inhibited dentine invasion and collagen adhesion by s. gordonii dl1 and s. mutans ng8, whilst dentine invasion by e. faecalis jh2-2 was reduced in the presence of serum, but not inhibited, and binding to collagen was enhanced. conclusions: it is postulated that a virulence factor of e. faecalis in failed endodontically treated teeth may be related to the ability of e. faecalis cells to maintain the  capability to invade dentinal tubules and adhere to collagen in the presence of human serum.

TI  == characterization of selected strains of pneumococcal surface protein a.
AB  == several proteins, in addition to the polysaccharide capsule, have recently been implicated in the full virulence of the streptococcus pneumoniae bacterial pathogen. one of these novel virulence factors of s. pneumoniae is pneumococcal surface protein a (pspa). the n-terminal, cell surface exposed, and functional part of pspa is essential for full pneumococcal virulence, as evidenced by the fact that antibodies raised against this part of the protein are protective against pneumococcal infections. pspa has recently been implicated in anti-complementary function as it reduces complement-mediated clearance and phagocytosis of pneumococci. several recombinant n-terminal fragments of pspa from different strains of pneumococci, rx1, bg9739, bg6380, ef3296, and ef5668, were analyzed using circular dichroism, analytical ultracentrifugation sedimentation velocity and equilibrium methods, and sequence homology. uniformly, all strains of pspa molecules studied have a high alpha-helical secondary structure content and they adopt predominantly a coiled-coil structure with an elongated, likely rod-like shape. no beta-sheet structures were detected for any  of the pspa molecules analyzed. all pspas were found to be monomeric in solution  with the exception of the bg9739 strain which had the propensity to partially aggregate but only into a tetrameric form. these structural properties were correlated with the functional, anti-complementary properties of pspa molecules based on the polar distribution of highly charged termini of its coiled-coil domain. the recombinant rx1 pspa is currently under consideration for pneumococcal vaccine development.

AB  == the in vitro post-antibiotic effects (paes) of eight different concentrations of  linezolid against gram-positive cocci were investigated and the results analysed  using the sigmoid e(max) model for mathematically modelling the pae. mean maximal linezolid paes against strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and streptococcus pneumoniae were 2.2, 1.8, 2.8, 2.0 and 3.0 h, respectively. resistance to methicillin (for the staphylococci), vancomycin (for the enterococci) and penicillin (for the pneumococci) had no effect on the duration of the pae. results of pae testing support twice-daily dosing of linezolid in humans.

TI  == intrauterine infection may be a major cause of stillbirth in sweden.
AB  == aim of the study: to investigate intrauterine infection as a cause for unexplained stillbirth. methods: chorioamnionitis was studied in a material of stillbirths (117 subjects from the years 1985-1994) from a region in the south sweden. control material (126 alive and healthy newborns and with healthy mothers) was gathered from the same region. results: chorioamnionitis was a common diagnosis both with stillbirths and 'healthy' deliveries (82 and 68%, respectively). extension of the inflammation to decidua basalis was seven times more common among stillbirths than among controls (odds ratio 7.2, confidence interval 2.8-21.9). the most common bacteria found at cultures were escherichia coli, coagulase negative staphylococcus, enterococcus faecalis and group b streptococcus. the risk for stillbirth was doubled if both inflammation and bacteria were present (odds ratio 2.3, confidence interval 0.92-5.8). meconium discharge was more common among stillbirths than controls (odds ratio=4.7, confidence interval 1.7-14). there were no differences in any respect regarding macerated and non-macerated stillbirths. our findings are similar to the results  from studies in developing countries except for the higher incidence of stillbirths in such countries. conclusions: thus, a large part of otherwise unexplained stillbirths might be due to ascending infections.

TI  == [pattern of antimicrobial susceptibility in uropathogen isolates from children].
AB  == the bacteriological profile in children with culture-positive bacteriuria was analyzed during a 5-year period. escherichia coli was the most common cause of urinary tract infections (57%), followed by streptococcus faecalis (11%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8%), and proteus mirabilis (6%). results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing indicated that cephalosporins (first, second and third generation) and nitrofurantoin are the best empirical oral treatment for urinary  infections in children. fosfomycin is a valid option in some cases. in hospitalized children treatment must be initiated with a third-generation cephalosporin, and gentamicin can be added in severely ill inpatients. these treatments can be modified when microbiological results become available.

TI  == the replicon of the cryptic plasmid psbo1 isolated from streptococcus bovis jb1.
AB  == the cryptic plasmid psbo1 (3904 bp) was isolated from streptococcus bovis jb1. psbo1 contained an open reading frame (orf) that is homologous to sequences encoding the replication protein (rep) in pefc1 (isolated from enterococcus faecalis), psk639 (staphylococcus epidermidis), pla103 (lactobacillus acidophilus), and pucl287 (tetragenococcus halophila). in addition, four 22-bp direct repeats (drs) were located upstream of the putative replication gene (rep) of psbo1. recombinant plasmids (psbe10 and psbe11) containing the drs and putative rep of psbo1 replicated in s. bovis 12-u-1 and no8 strains. this result  indicates that the putative rep encoded rep and that the replicon of psbo1 contained the drs and the rep. gel shift assays showed that the rep of psbo1 bound the 22-bp drs.

TI  == identification of novel essential escherichia coli genes conserved among pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == we deleted a subset of 27 open reading frames (orfs) from escherichia coli which  encode previously uncharacterized, probably soluble gene products homologous to proteins from a broad spectrum of bacterial pathogens such as haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis and only distantly related to eukaryotic proteins. six novel bacteria-specific genes essential for growth in complex medium could be identified through a combination of bioinformatics-based and experimental approaches. we also compared our data to published results of gene inactivation projects with mycoplasma genitalium and bacillus subtilis and looked for homologs in all known prokaryotic genomes. such analyses highlight the enormous metabolic  flexibility of prokaryotes. six of 27 studied genes have been functionally characterized up to now, amongst these four of the essential genes. the gene products ygbp, ygbb and ychb are involved in the non-mevalonate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis. kdtb is characterized as the posphopantetheine adenylyltransferase coad. there are indications that the other two essential gene products yjee and yqgf, which we have identified, also possess enzymatic functions. these findings demonstrate the potential of such proteins to be used in screening of large chemical libraries for inhibitors which could be further developed to novel broad-spectrum antibiotics.

TI  == in vitro activities of ertapenem (mk-0826) against recent clinical bacteria collected in europe and australia.
AB  == ertapenem (mk-0826, l-749,345) is a 1-beta-methyl carbapenem with a long serum half-life. its in vitro activity was determined by broth microdilution against 3,478 bacteria from 12 centers in europe and australia, with imipenem, cefepime,  ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam used as comparators. ertapenem was the most active agent tested against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, with mics at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic(90)s) of < or =1 microg/ml for all species. ertapenem also was more active than imipenem against fastidious gram-negative bacteria and moraxella spp.; on the other hand, ertapenem was slightly less active than imipenem against streptococci, methicillin-susceptible  staphylococci, and anaerobes, but its mic(90)s for these groups remained < or =0.5 microg/ml. acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa were also much less susceptible to ertapenem than imipenem, and most enterococcus faecalis strains were resistant. ertapenem resistance, based on a provisional nccls mic breakpoint of > or =16 microg/ml, was seen in only 3 of 1,611 strains of the family enterobacteriaceae tested, all of them enterobacter aerogenes. resistance was also seen in 2 of 135 anaerobes, comprising 1 bacteroides fragilis strain and 1 clostridium difficile strain. ertapenem breakpoints for streptococci have not been established, but an unofficial susceptibility breakpoint of < or =2 microg/ml was adopted for clinical trials to generate corresponding clinical response data for isolates for which mics were as high as 2 microg/ml. of 234 streptococcus pneumoniae strains tested, 2 required ertapenem mics of 2 microg/ml and one required an mic of 4 microg/ml, among 67 non-streptococcus pyogenes, non-streptococcus pneumoniae streptococci, single isolates required ertapenem mics of 2 and 16 microg/ml. these streptococci also had diminished susceptibilities to other beta-lactams, including imipenem as well as ertapenem.  the etest and disk diffusion gave susceptibility test results in good agreement with those of the broth microdilution method for ertapenem.

TI  == resistance studies with daptomycin.
AB  == we studied the in vitro emergence of resistance to daptomycin using three methods: spontaneous resistance incidence, serial passage in the presence of increasing drug concentrations, and chemical mutagenesis. no spontaneously resistant mutants were obtained for any organism tested (<10(-10) for staphylococcus aureus, <10(-9) for staphylococcus epidermidis, <10(-9) for enterococcus faecalis, <10(-9) for enterococcus faecium, <10(-8) for streptococcus pneumoniae). population analysis demonstrated that bacterial susceptibility to daptomycin is heterogeneous. assay results were sensitive to calcium concentration and culture density, both of which can affect apparent resistance rates. stable s. aureus mutants were isolated by both serial passage in liquid media and chemical mutagenesis. the daptomycin mics for these isolates  were 8- to 32-fold higher than for the parental strain. many mutants with high mics (>12.5 microg/ml) had significant growth defects but did not display phenotypes typical of s. aureus small colony variants. the voltage component (delta psi) of the bacterial membrane potential was increased in three independent resistant isolates. in vivo data showed that some daptomycin-resistant mutants had lost significant virulence. for other mutants, the degree of in vitro resistance was greater than the change in in vivo susceptibility. these results suggest that infection with some daptomycin-resistant organisms may still be easily treatable.

TI  == new gene cluster for lantibiotic streptin possibly involved in streptolysin s formation.
AB  == streptolysin s (sls) is a serum-extractable and oxygen-stable hemolysin produced  by group a streptococcus. a sls-deficient mutant in which transposon tn 916 was inserted in a locus distinct from the sag gene cluster [nizet et al. (2000) infect. immun. 68, 4245-4254] was obtained by filter mating of the transposon-harbouring enterococcus faecalis strain and streptococcus pyogenes bl(t). this mutant, n22, had completely lost the hemolytic activity, in consequence of insertion of a single tn 916 into a hitherto-unknown lantibiotic gene cluster composed of 10 open reading frames. the arrangement and sequence of  this lantibiotic gene cluster were similar to those of nisin and subtilin, and so we designated this new lantibiotic as streptin. the bactericidal activity of streptin was abolished on treatment with trypsin or proteinase k. the different host range and nucleotide sequence clearly distinguished streptin from streptococcins. streptin was not hemolytic and its bacteriocin activity was independent of carrier oligonucleotides effective for sls. the fact that n22 also lost the anti-bacterial activity against indicator streptococci reveals that the  factor(s) required for lantibiotic formation plays an important role in sls formation as well.

TI  == linezolid: a review of its use in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
AB  == linezolid is the first of a new class of antibacterial drugs, the oxazolidinones. it has inhibitory activity against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), glycopeptide-intermediate s. aureus (gisa), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the drug also shows activity against certain anaerobes, including clostridium perfringens, c. difficile, peptostreptococcus spp. and bacteroidesfragilis. in controlled phase iii studies, linezolid was as effective as vancomycin in the treatment of patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci and also demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by vre. further phase iii studies have demonstrated that linezolid is an effective treatment for patients with nosocomial pneumonia, for hospitalised patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and for patients with complicated skin or soft tissue infections (sstis). in these studies, linezolid was as effective as established treatments,  including third-generation cephalosporins in patients with pneumonia, and oxacillin in patients with complicated sstis. oral linezolid 400 or 600mg twice daily was as effective as clarithromycin 250mg twice daily or cefpodoxime proxetil 200mg twice daily in the treatment of patients with uncomplicated sstis  or community-acquired pneumonia. linezolid is a generally well tolerated drug. the most frequently reported adverse events in linezolid recipients were diarrhoea, headache, nausea and vomiting. thrombocytopenia was also documented in a small proportion (about 2%) of patients treated with the drug. conclusions: linezolid has good activity against gram-positive bacteria, particularly multidrug resistant strains of s. aureus (including gisa), enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis (including vre). in controlled clinical trials, linezolid was as  effective as vancomycin in eradicating infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus spp. and has demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by vre. as the level of resistance to vancomycin increases among s. aureus and enterococci, linezolid is poised to play an important role in the management of serious gram-positive infections.

AB  == thermophilic streptococci play an important role in the manufacture of many european cheeses, and a rapid and reliable method for their identification is needed. randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) pcr (rapd-pcr) with two different primers coupled to hierarchical cluster analysis has proven to be a powerful tool for the classification and typing of streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecium, and enterococcus faecalis (g. moschetti, g. blaiotta, m. aponte, p. catzeddu, f. villani, p. deiana, and s. coppola, j. appl. microbiol. 85:25-36, 1998). in order to develop a fast and inexpensive method for the identification of thermophilic streptococci, rapd-pcr patterns were generated with a single primer (xd9), and the results were analyzed using artificial neural networks (multilayer perceptron, radial basis function network, and bayesian network) and multivariate statistical techniques (cluster analysis, linear discriminant analysis, and classification trees). cluster analysis allowed the identification of s. thermophilus but not of enterococci. a bayesian network proved to be more effective than a multilayer perceptron or a radial basis function network for the identification of s. thermophilus, e. faecium, and e. faecalis using simplified rapd-pcr patterns (obtained by summing the bands in selected areas of the patterns). the bayesian network also significantly outperformed two multivariate statistical techniques (linear discriminant analysis and classification trees) and proved to be less sensitive to the size of the training set and more robust in the response to patterns belonging to unknown species.

TI  == aggregation substance-mediated adherence of enterococcus faecalis to immobilized  extracellular matrix proteins.
AB  == aggregation substance (as) of enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis), a sex pheromone plasmid encoded cell surface protein, mediates the formation of bacterial aggregates, thereby promoting plasmid transfer. the influence of pad1-encoded as, asa1, on binding to immobilized extracellular matrix proteins was studied. the presence of as increased enterococcal adherence to fibronectin more than eight-fold, to thrombospondin more than four-fold, to vitronectin more  than three-fold, and to collagen type i more than two-fold (p<0.001). in contrast, binding to laminin and collagen type iv occurred independently of as. adherence of the constitutively as expressing e. faecalis og1x(pam721) to immobilized fibronectin was found to be approximately five times higher than that of staphylococcus aureus cowan and approximately 30 times higher than that of streptococcus bovis. investigation of strains with various deletions within the structural gene of asa1 suggests that attachment to immobilized fibronectin is mainly mediated by amino acids within the variable region or by neighbouring residues. thus, as may promote adherence to injured epithelium and endothelium, where extracellular matrix proteins are exposed, thereby facilitating colonization and infection.

TI  == [identification of microbial subtypes from antibiotic susceptibility data in clinical laboratory for nosocomial infection surveillance].
AB  == we developed an algorism to identify microbial subtypes automatically from daily  antibiotic susceptibility data in clinical microbiology laboratory. the susceptibility pattern was expressed as a string of digits, each consisting of 0(resistant), 1(intermediate) or 2(susceptible) to respective antibiotics. any two patterns were regarded identical and combined if the difference at each digit never exceeds 1. the combined pattern was expressed as an array of digit-by-digit weighted averages of the two. the second combination was based on a degree of similarity among the numerical patterns using a formula, which was designed to emphasize differences in highly variable elements. this subgrouping procedure was done every three months. identity of the detected subtypes between the intervals  was determined using the same algorism as for the second combination. the algorism was applied to data of clinical isolates of mrsa, pseudomonas aeruginosa (pa), klebsiella pneumoniae (kp), enterococcus faecalis (ef), streptococcus pneumoniae (sp), escherichia coli (ec) that were obtained over a period of 4 years. three major subtypes of mrsa, kp and ef were consistently detected with shifting mutual frequencies. most of ec isolates belonged to two consistent subtypes. although pa and sp had one or two consistent subtypes, there were multiple minor subtypes of varying frequencies. this analysis is regarded as an "infotyping", in contrast to serotype or genotype, of clinical microbial isolates, which is useful for nosocomial infection surveillance.

AB  == the influence of non-quinolone antimicrobial agents on the antibacterial activities of gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin was determined using chequerboard, fractional inhibitory concentration, (fic) and time-kill analysis methods. in the chequerboard method, the quinolones were tested in combination with ten antimicrobial agents (macrolides, aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, vancomycin, rifampicin and chloramphenicol) against five bacterial strains (one strain each of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus  faecalis and streptococcus pneumoniae). in no incidence was antagonism (fic > or  = 4) or synergy (fic < or = 0.5) observed; all dual drug combinations involving gatifloxacin or ciprofloxacin showed additivity/indifference (fic > 0.5, < 4). by time-kill analysis, the strains were tested at a quinolone concentration equal to 8 x mic in combination with a second antibiotic at 0.5xits mic. these combinations killed non-enterococcal strains at rates similar to those with quinolones alone. however, rifampicin and chloramphenicol were often antagonistic (100-fold lesser killing) to the lethal action of gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin  against e. faecalis. these findings indicate that, with the exception of e. faecalis, the antibacterial activities of quinolones are generally additive/indifferent to those of other antimicrobial agents.

TI  == antimicrobial evaluation of certain plants used in mexican traditional medicine for the treatment of respiratory diseases.
AB  == eighteen crude extracts, including six hexanic, six chloroformic and six methanolic from six different plant species used in mexican traditional medicine  for the treatment of respiratory infections, were evaluated for potential antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, and candida albicans. the minimal inhibitory concentration was determined for each extract using a two-fold dilution assay. the results showed that 16 crude extracts (89%)  exhibited antimicrobial activity against at least one of the microorganisms tested at concentrations of 5 mg/ml or below. the extracts from gnaphalium oxyphyllum, gnaphalium americanum, and crescentia alata possessed strong antimicrobial activity against the pathogens tested.

TI  == use of preclinical data for selection of a phase ii/iii dose for evernimicin and  identification of a preclinical mic breakpoint.
AB  == one of the most challenging issues in the design of phase ii/iii clinical trials  of antimicrobial agents is dose selection. the choice is often based on preclinical data from pharmacokinetic (pk) studies with animals and healthy volunteers but is rarely linked directly to the target organisms except by the mic, an in vitro measure of antimicrobial activity with many limitations. it is the thesis of this paper that rational dose-selection decisions can be made on the basis of the pharmacodynamics (pds) of the test agent predicted by a mathematical model which uses four data sets: (i) the distribution of mics for clinical isolates, (ii) the distribution of the values of the pk parameters for the test drug in the population, (iii) the pd target(s) developed from animal models of infection, and (iv) the protein binding characteristics of the test drug. in performing this study with the new anti-infective agent evernimicin, we  collected a large number (n = 4,543) of recent clinical isolates of gram-positive pathogens (streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, and staphylococcus aureus) and determined the mics using e-test methods  (ab biodisk, stockholm, sweden) for susceptibility to evernimicin. population pk  data were collected from healthy volunteers (n = 40) and patients with hypoalbuminemia (n = 12), and the data were analyzed by using npem iii. pd targets were developed with a neutropenic murine thigh infection model with three target pathogens: s. pneumoniae (n = 5), e. faecalis (n = 2), and s. aureus (n =  4). drug exposure or the ratio of the area under the concentration-time curve/mic (auc/mic) was found to be the best predictor of microbiological efficacy. there were three possible microbiological results: stasis of the initial inoculum at 24 h (10(7) cfu), log killing (pathogen dependent, ranging from 1 to 3 log(10)), or  90% maximal killing effect (90% e(max)). the levels of protein binding in humans  and mice were similar. the pk and pd of 6 and 9 mg of evernimicin per kg of body  weight were compared; the population values for the model parameters and population covariance matrix were used to generate five monte carlo simulations with 200 subjects each. the fractional probability of attaining the three pd targets was calculated for each dose and for each of the three pathogens. all differences in the fractional probability of attaining the target auc/mic in this pd model were significant. for s. pneumoniae, the probability of attaining all three pd targets was high for both doses. for s. aureus and enterococci, there were increasing differences between the 6- and 9-mg/kg evernimicin doses for reaching the 2 log killing (s. aureus), 1 log killing (enterococci), or 90% e(max) auc/mic targets. this same approach may also be used to set preliminary in vitro mic breakpoints.

AB  == mics of gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin against 3482 pre-treatment, clinical trial isolates collected during 1997-1998 are reported. these data suggested that gatifloxacin was four- to eight-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against gram-positive bacteria, with gatifloxacin mic(90)s < or = 0.33 mg/l against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae, and < or = 1.0 mg/l versus viridans streptococci and enterococcus faecalis. both quinolones had similar mic(90)s versus enterobacteriaceae (generally < or = 0.38 mg/l, except 0. 7-0.8 mg/l for citrobacter freundii) and pseudomonas aeruginosa ( approximately 8 mg/l). a total of 78% p. aeruginosa had gatifloxacin mics < or = 2 mg/l. gatifloxacin was more active than ciprofloxacin against acinetobacter species and non-p. aeruginosa pseudomonads. both had exceptional activity versus haemophilus  spp, moraxella catarrhalis and neisseria gonorrhoeae. in summary, compared to ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin had improved activity against gram-positive bacteria  and comparable activity against gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of meropenem versus other extended-spectrum antimicrobial agents against 2,085 clinical isolates tested in 13 brazilian centers.
AB  == meropenem is a parenteral carbapenem antibacterial agent with a very broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. it is the second agent of its class to become available in brazil. the in vitro antibacterial activity of meropenem was compared with imipenem and four other antimicrobial agents in a multicenter study. this study involved 13 clinical microbiology laboratories, 10 of which came from 8 brazilian states. a total of 2,085 clinical isolates consecutively collected between december 1995 and march 1996 were susceptibility tested using the etest and following the nccls procedures. meropenem inhibited more than 90% of isolates of enterobacteriaceae at 0.5 microg/ml, except for citrobacter sp. (1 microg/ml). generally, meropenem was slightly more active than imipenem against gram-negative organisms and its spectrum of antimicrobial activity was broader than those of all other drugs tested. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, meropenem (mic50, 0.38 microg/ml) was approximately 8-fold more active than imipenem (mic 50,3 microg/ml). imipenem was two-to eight-fold more active than meropenem against some gram-positive specees oxacillin, including enterococcus faecalis (mic 50 of 0.75 microg/ml and 2 microg/ml respectively), oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic 50 of 0.47 &mul;g/ml and 0.094 microg/ml), oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (mic 50 of 0.064 microg/ml and 0.5mg/ml). against streptococcus sp. meropenem was slightly more active than imipenem (mic 50, 0.016 microg/ml). the results of this study may be used to guide empiric therapy in brazil and indicates that meropenem may have an important role in the treatment of infections caused by multiresistant strains of bacteria.

TI  == susceptibility of gram-positive cocci from 25 uk hospitals to antimicrobial agents including linezolid. the linezolid study group.
AB  == the prevalence of antibiotic resistance amongst gram-positive cocci from 25 uk hospitals was studied over an 8 month period in 1999. a total of 3770 isolates were tested by the sentinel laboratories using the etest; these bacteria comprised 1000 pneumococci, 1005 staphylococcus aureus, 769 coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) and 996 enterococci. to ensure quality, 10% of the isolates were retested centrally, as were any found to express unusual resistance patterns. the prevalence of penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) varied widely amongst the sentinel laboratories. the resistance rates to methicillin among s. aureus and cns were 19.2 and 38.9%, respectively, with mrsa  rates in individual sentinel sites ranging from 0 to 43%. no glycopeptide resistance was seen in s. aureus, but 6.5% of cns isolates were teicoplanin resistant and 0.5% were vancomycin resistant. vancomycin resistance was much more frequent among enterococcus faecium (24.1%) than e. faecalis (0.5%) (p<0.05), with most resistant isolates carrying vana. the rate of penicillin resistance in  pneumococci was 8.9%, and this resistance was predominantly intermediate (7.9%),  with only six hospitals reporting isolates with high level resistance. the prevalence of erythromycin resistance among pneumococci was 12.3%, with the majority of resistant isolates having the macrolide efflux mechanism mediated by  mefe. all the organisms tested were susceptible to linezolid with mics in the range 0.12-4 mg/l. the modal mics of linezolid were 1 mg/l for cns and pneumococci, and 2 mg/l for s. aureus and enterococci. linezolid was the most potent agent tested against gram-positive cocci, including multiresistant strains, and as such may prove a valuable therapeutic option for the management of gram-positive infections in hospitals.

TI  == evidence for horizontal gene transfer in evolution of elongation factor tu in enterococci.
AB  == the elongation factor tu, encoded by tuf genes, is a gtp binding protein that plays a central role in protein synthesis. one to three tuf genes per genome are  present, depending on the bacterial species. most low-g+c-content gram-positive bacteria carry only one tuf gene. we have designed degenerate pcr primers derived from consensus sequences of the tuf gene to amplify partial tuf sequences from 17 enterococcal species and other phylogenetically related species. the amplified dna fragments were sequenced either by direct sequencing or by sequencing cloned  inserts containing putative amplicons. two different tuf genes (tufa and tufb) were found in 11 enterococcal species, including enterococcus avium, enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus dispar, enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus malodoratus, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus pseudoavium, and enterococcus raffinosus. for  the other six enterococcal species (enterococcus cecorum, enterococcus columbae,  enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus sulfureus, enterococcus saccharolyticus, and  enterococcus solitarius), only the tufa gene was present. based on 16s rrna gene  sequence analysis, the 11 species having two tuf genes all have a common ancestor, while the six species having only one copy diverged from the enterococcal lineage before that common ancestor. the presence of one or two copies of the tuf gene in enterococci was confirmed by southern hybridization. phylogenetic analysis of tuf sequences demonstrated that the enterococcal tufa gene branches with the bacillus, listeria, and staphylococcus genera, while the enterococcal tufb gene clusters with the genera streptococcus and lactococcus. primary structure analysis showed that four amino acid residues encoded within the sequenced regions are conserved and unique to the enterococcal tufb genes and the tuf genes of streptococci and lactococcus lactis. the data suggest that an ancestral streptococcus or a streptococcus-related species may have horizontally  transferred a tuf gene to the common ancestor of the 11 enterococcal species which now carry two tuf genes.

TI  == identification of a porphyromonas gingivalis receptor for the streptococcus gordonii sspb protein.
AB  == colonization of the plaque biofilm by the oral pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis  is favored by the presence of antecedent organisms such as streptococcus gordonii. coadhesion between p. gingivalis and s. gordonii can be mediated by the sspb protein of s. gordonii; however, the p. gingivalis cognate receptor for this protein has not been identified. in this study, we identified a surface protein of p. gingivalis that interacts with the sspb protein. coprecipitation between p. gingivalis outer membrane proteins and purified sspb protein demonstrated that a  100-kda p. gingivalis protein bound to sspb. the 100-kda protein also bound to an engineered strain of enterococcus faecalis that expresses the sspb protein on the cell surface. monospecific polyclonal antibodies to the 100-kda protein inhibited the binding between p. gingivalis and s. gordonii in a dose-dependent manner up to 86%. amino acid sequencing of the 100-kda protein showed homology to a protein previously identified as the p. gingivalis minor fimbria. the minor fimbrial protein may exist as a complex with a hemagglutinin-like protein since the genes  encoding these proteins are adjacent on the chromosome and are cotranscribed. thus, the p. gingivalis receptor for s. gordonii sspb is a 100-kda protein that structurally may be a minor fimbria-protein complex and functionally effectuates  coadhesion.

TI  == evaluation of the in vitro activity of 9 antimicrobials against bacterial strains isolated from patients in intensive care units in brazil: mystic antimicrobial surveillance program.
AB  == multi-resistant bacterial strains are increasingly prevalent in hospital environments. bacterial resistance is an important problem, especially for practitioners in intensive care units (icus) because of the selective pressure on the prevalent bacteria in these environments. the mystic (meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection) study has been monitoring the performance of carbapenems and other antibiotics in different hospitals for at least 3 years. the in vitro activities of meropenem, imipenem, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, piperacilin/tazobactam, gentamicin, and tobramycin were compared against 452 recent clinical aerobic isolates. the isolates consisted of 19 species of gram-negative bacteria (n=290) including k. pneumoniae (n=49), e. coli (n=48), a. baumannii (n=47), enterobacter spp. (n=41), and p. aeruginosa (n=33) and 9 species of gram-positive bacteria (n=162) including staphylococcus aureus (n=63), enterococcus faecalis (n=22), streptococcus pneumoniae (n=22) and coagulase negative staphylococci (n=21). all  isolates were collected from icu patients. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined by etest methodology, using standardized and controlled procedures. meropenem and imipenem showed the lowest mic(90) for all species tested. gram-negative isolates showed the following overall resistance percentages to the other 7 drugs: tobramycin (43.1%), cefotaxime (38.6%), gentamicin (34.1%), ceftazidime (31.7%), ciprofloxacin (25.5%), piperacillin/tazobactam (26.9%), and cefepime (18.6%). carbapenems were the most  active drugs overall and only p. aeruginosa presented some degree of resistance (18.2%). we also evaluated the production of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) among all enterobacteriaceae members (n=176) by etest/esbl strip. esbl production was detected in 51 strains (29.0%). among them, klebsiella pneumoniae  was the most prevalent at 59.2%, followed by enterobacter spp. (19.5%) and e. coli (14.6%). the high level of resistance against several antimicrobials and the alarming rate of esbl production may restrict therapeutic choice to the carbapenems in this selected group of patients.

TI  == enterococcus faecalis conjugative plasmid pam373: complete nucleotide sequence and genetic analyses of sex pheromone response.
AB  == pam373 is a 36.7 kb conjugative plasmid in enterococcus faecalis that encodes a response to a peptide sex pheromone, cam373, secreted by plasmid-free (recipient) strains of enterococci. it was identified over 15 years ago as one of five plasmids in e. faecalis strain rc73 and was of interest because a related pheromone activity could be detected in culture supernatants of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus gordonii. because of increased clinical concern relating to the possibility of mobilizing vancomycin resistance determinants from enterococci, where they are becoming common, into pathogens such as s. aureus, efforts were initiated to characterize pam373 further. the results of a complete  nucleotide sequence determination of pam373, as well as a genetic analysis of key genes related to regulation of the pheromone response, are reported here. with regard to determinants related to conjugation, the plasmid has a structural organization similar to other known pheromone-responsive plasmids such as pad1, pcf10 and ppd1; however, there are several unique features. although there are significant homologues relating to a pheromone-binding surface protein (trac) and a negatively regulating protein (traa), there is an absence of a determinant equivalent to trab of pad1 (reduces endogenous pheromone) and a determinant for surface-exclusion protein. the precursor structure of the inhibitor peptide iam373 was identified, and its determinant (iam373) was found to be about 500 nt  upstream of an apparent transcription terminator t1. tn917-lac insertion analyses provided interesting insights into aspects of control of the pheromone response and showed that, although the traa product is sensitive to pheromone, it appears  to act differently from the traa homologue of pad1.

AB  == background: monoclonal (mabkt) and recombinant single-chain (scfvkt) anti-idiotypic antibodies were produced to represent the internal image of a yeast killer toxin (kt) characterized by a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity, including gram-positive cocci. pathogenic eukaryotic and prokaryotic microorganisms, such as candida albicans, pneumocystis carinii, and a multidrug-resistant strain of mycobacterium tuberculosis, presenting specific, although yet undefined, kt-cell wall receptors (ktr), have proven to be killed in vitro by mabkt and scfvkt. mabkt and scfvkt exert a therapeutic effect in vivo in experimental models of candidiasis and pneumocystosis by mimicking the functional activity of protective antibodies naturally produced in humans against ktr of infecting microorganisms. the swelling tide of concern over increasing bacterial  resistance to antibiotic drugs gives the impetus to develop new therapeutic compounds against microbial threat. thus, the in vitro bactericidal activity of mabkt and scfvkt against gram-positive, drug-resistant cocci of major epidemiological interest was investigated. materials and methods: mabkt and scfvkt generated by hybridoma and dna recombinant technology from the spleen lymphocytes of mice immunized with a kt-neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mab kt4) were used in a conventional colony forming unit (cfu) assay to determine, from a qualitative point of view, their bactericidal activity against staphylococcus aureus, s. haemolyticus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae strains. these bacterial strains are characterized by different patterns of resistance to antibiotics, including methicillin, vancomycin, and penicillin. results: according to the experimental conditions adopted, no bacterial isolate proved to be resistant to the activity of mabkt and scfvkt. conclusions: scfvkt exerted a microbicidal activity against multidrug resistant bacteria, which may represent the basis for the drug modeling of new antibiotics with broad antibacterial spectra to tackle the emergence of microbial resistance.

TI  == the synthesis and antibacterial activity of totarol derivatives. part 3: modification of ring-b.
AB  == ring-b derivatization of totarol (1) afforded the series of compounds 2-22 which  were screened in vitro against: beta-lactamase-positive and high level gentamycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), and multiresistant klebsiella pneumoniae. several of the derivatives retained much of the antibacterial activity of totatol against the first three of these organisms  (all gram-positive), but none was more active. the gram-negative klebsiella was resistant to all compounds examined. totarol (1) was shown to uncouple oxidative  phosphorylation in isolated mitochondria at 50 microm.

AB  == to evaluate the resistance for major oral antimicrobial agents, mainly new quinolones, we carried out a drug susceptibility surveillance of 3,050 strains of 11 microbial species clinically isolated at 8 institutions such as general hospitals and examination centers in hiroshima city. 10 antimicrobial agents were used: 3 new quinolone drugs, 5 beta-lactam drugs, minocycline and clarithromycin. among gram-positive bacteria, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa)  and enterococcus faecalis showed low susceptibility to the new quinolone drugs, while methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) and streptococcus pneumoniae were highly sensitive to these drugs. among gram-negative bacteria, pseudomonas aeruginosa showed high resistance for the new quinolone drugs, but enteric bacteria and haemophilus influenzae did not show marked resistance, maintaining almost good sensitivity to these drugs. to reduce the appearance of resistant bacteria, appropriate antimicrobial agents should be selected. drug susceptibility surveillance in the community will be also important in the future.

AB  == the mef gene, originally described for gram-positive organisms and coding for an  efflux pump, has been identified in clinical isolates of acinetobacter junii and  neisseria gonorrhoeae. these strains could transfer the mef gene at frequencies ranging from 10(-6) to 10(-9) into one or more of the following recipients: gram-negative moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria perflava/sicca and neisseria mucosa and gram-positive enterococcus faecalis. three streptococcus pneumoniae strains could transfer the mef gene into eikenella corrodens, haemophilus influenzae, kingella denitrificans, m. catarrhalis, neisseria meningitidis, n. perflava/sicca, and n. mucosa at similar frequencies. the mef gene can thus be transferred to and expressed in a variety of gram-negative recipients.

AB  == the bacteriostatic potency of the cerium-humic acid complex was evaluated by experimental measurement of this complex interaction with e. coli, bacillus pyocyaneus, staphylococcus aureus, leuconostoc and streptococcus faecalis, and by comparison bacteriostatic effects with the cerium-citrate complex. the experimental results indicated that the cerium-humic acid complex strongly inhibited growth of all five bacterial strains, and its diameter of bacteriostatic circles were more than 30 mm. the minimal bacteria-inhibiting concentration were 1 x 10(-3), 2 x 10(-3) and 1 x 10(-2) mol/l for e. coli and bacillus pyocyaneus, staphylococcus aureus, and leuconostoc and streptococcus faecalis individually, and the measured minimal bactericidal concentrations were  2 x 10(-3) and 1 x 10(-2) mol/l for bacillus pyocyaneus, e. coli, and leuconostoc. to kill staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis, the concentration had to be more than 1 x 10(-20 mol/l. on the contrary, we found that cerium-citrate complex did not inhibit the growth of the above five bacteria, but stimulated bacterial growth. the completely different bacteriostatic results of two cerium complexes may hint that the association and  chemical properties of the two complexes were different.

TI  == characterization of opua, a glycine-betaine uptake system of lactococcus lactis.
AB  == a lactococcus lactis glycine-betaine transport system was identified by functional complementation of an escherichia coli prop prou mutant with a gene library from l. lactis sbsp. cremoris. the cloned locus forms an operon highly homologous to opua, encoding a glycine-betaine uptake system of bacillus subtilis. disruption of opua in l. lactis abolished protection by glycine-betaine against elevated osmolarity. opua belongs to the so-called "abc transporters" family, which comprise an extracellularly localized substrate-binding protein. in b. subtilis opua system, this binding protein is a lipoprotein, attached to the external face of the cytoplasmic membrane by its lipidic moiety. in contrast, in  the l. lactis opua operon, and in other gram-positive homologues as well, a fusion between the gene encoding the integral membrane protein and the substrate-binding protein components gave rise to a hybrid protein presumably attaching the substrate-binding protein to the surface of the cell via its covalent link to the integral membrane component. mapping of l. lactis opua transcription start identified one mrna, more abundant in cells grown at elevated osmolarity. construction of an opua-gusa fusion confirmed that opua transcription is directed by a promoter osmotically inducible in l. lactis. when recombined upstream from a lac transcriptional fusion in the chromosome of e. coli, the opua promoter appeared as very strong, and only poorly stimulated by elevated osmotic  pressure, suggesting the existence of a specific machinery involved in the osmotic signal transduction in l. lactis.

AB  == in response to conflicting reports on the chemical stability of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a study was designed to assess the in vitro longevity  and effects of media and storage conditions on this streptogramin combination. broth microdilution trays containing parenteral (quinupristin/dalfopristin) and oral (rpr 106972) streptogramin combinations as well as pristinomycin components  (p-i and p-ii) were preincubated at 35 degrees c for 12-72 h before inoculation with control strains (streptococcus pneumoniae atcc 49619, haemophilus influenzae atcc 49247, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213) and five clinical isolates with various drug resistance phenotypes. overall, the  mean quinupristin/dalfopristin activity loss was 24%/12 h, 41%/18 h, 43%/24 h, 69%/48 h and 79%/72 h with no detected loss of potency when measured by e. faecalis until 18 h. rpr 106972 mean activity loss was 6%/12 h, 19%/18 h, 19%/24  h, 56%/48 h and 71%/72 h with no loss of potency as measured by s. aureus until 48 h. overall, p-i components had greater stability as compared with p-ii for both drug combinations. bioassays showed similar trends in decreased activity. bioassay differences among media types were only significant (> 3 mm; greater loss of potency) for haemophilus test media for both p-ii components at 72 h. the presence of an organism in the medium had no effect on stability assay results. the effect of storage temperature (4, 25 degrees c) on quinupristin/dalfopristin  and rpr 106972 stability was also detrimental to drug potency indicating the requirement for rigid quality assurance for streptogramin diagnostic reagents when determining activity by reference or standardized susceptibility tests.

AB  == many food and meat processors test environmental swabs and sponges to confirm the absence of listeria spp. spectral pattern changes in a liquid growth medium, resulting from esculin hydrolysis by listeria in contaminated swabs and sponges,  were automatically monitored by the biosys instrument in a semifluid layer (sfl). the blackening of sfl in modified mox broth resulted in sharply declining curves, which were easily detected by the instrument. the instrument detected all nine strains of listeria monocytogenes tested. none of the gram negative organisms (proteus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas, citrobacter and yersinia) were detected  by the system, nor were most gram positive organisms, including bacillus, streptococcus, and lactobacillus strains, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis, which hydrolyze esculin, produced black colonies on palcam and oxford media and were also detected in the system. a total of 122 sponges and swabs collected at food processing plants were evaluated by this method. of these, 99 were negative, and 11 were positive. l. innocua was the dominant listeria species in these environmental samples. good correlation was obtained between numbers of listeria and detection times of esculin hydrolysis: 1000 cfu/swab were detected in 10-13 h, whereas 1-10 cfu/swab were detected in less than 22 h. the total assay time was 26 h.

TI  == the gene encoding iiab(man)l in streptococcus salivarius is part of a tetracistronic operon encoding a phosphoenolpyruvate: mannose/glucose phosphotransferase system.
AB  == glucose and mannose are transported in streptococci by the mannose-pts (phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose phosphotransferase system), which consists of a cytoplasmic iiab protein, called iiab(man), and an uncharacterized membrane permease. this paper reports the characterization of the man operon encoding the  specific components of the mannose-pts of streptococcus salivarius. the man operon was composed of four genes, manl, manm, mann and mano. these genes were transcribed from a canonical promoter (pman) into a 3.6 kb polycistronic mrna that contained a 5'-utr (untranslated region). the predicted manl gene product encoded a 35.5 kda protein and contained the amino acid sequences of the iia and  iib phosphorylation sites already determined from purified s. salivarius iiab(man)l. expression of manl in escherichia coli generated a 35 kda protein that reacted with anti-iiab(man)l antibodies. the predicted manm protein had an estimated size of 27.2 kda. manm had similarity with iic domains of the mannose-eii family, but did not possess the signature proposed for mannose-iic proteins from gram-negative bacteria. from multiple alignment analyses of sequences available in current databases, the following modified iic(man) signature is proposed: gx3g[dnh]x3g[livm]2xg2[stl][lt][eq]. the deduced product of mann was a hydrophobic protein with a predicted molecular mass of 33.4 kda. the mann protein contained an amino acid sequence similar to the signature sequence of the iid domains of the mannose-eii family. mano encoded a 13.7 kda protein. this gene was also transcribed as a monocistronic mrna from a promoter located in the mann-mano intergenic region. a search of current databases revealed the presence of iiab(man)l, manm, mann and mano orthologues in streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis. this work has elucidated the molecular structure of the mannose pts in streptococci and enterococci, and demonstrated the presence of a putative regulatory protein (mano) within the man operon.

AB  == enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against ent. faecalis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. sake, listeria innocua, propionibacterium acidipropionici, propionibacterium sp., clostridium perfringens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium. one of the four pathogenic strains of escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. no  antimicrobial activity was recorded against bacillus cereus, cl. sporogenes, cl.  tyrobutyricum, leuconostoc cremoris, pediococcus pentosaceus, staphylococcus carnosus and streptococcus thermophilus. enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to proteinase k, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees c for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a ph of 1.0-5.0 and ph 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 au ml-1, but increased further to 1600 au ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. the peptide is approximately 3.4 kda in size, as determined after partial purification with amberlite xad-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the mechanism of antimicrobial activity against lact. sake lmg 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.

TI  == heterologous inducible expression of enterococcus faecalis pcf10 aggregation substance asc10 in lactococcus lactis and streptococcus gordonii contributes to cell hydrophobicity and adhesion to fibrin.
AB  == aggregation substance proteins encoded by the sex pheromone plasmid family of enterococcus faecalis have been shown previously to contribute to the formation of a stable mating complex between donor and recipient cells and have been implicated in the virulence of this increasingly important nosocomial pathogen. in an effort to characterize the protein further, prgb, the gene encoding the aggregation substance asc10 on pcf10, was cloned in a vector containing the nisin-inducible nisa promoter and its two-component regulatory system. expression of aggregation substance after nisin addition to cultures of e. faecalis and the  heterologous bacteria lactococcus lactis and streptococcus gordonii was demonstrated. electron microscopy revealed that asc10 was presented on the cell surfaces of e. faecalis and l. lactis but not on that of s. gordonii. the protein was also found in the cell culture supernatants of all three species. characterization of asc10 on the cell surfaces of e. faecalis and l. lactis revealed a significant increase in cell surface hydrophobicity upon expression of the protein. heterologous expression of asc10 on l. lactis also allowed the recognition of its binding ligand (ebs) on the enterococcal cell surface, as indicated by increased transfer of a conjugative transposon. we also found that adhesion of asc10-expressing bacterial cells to fibrin was elevated, consistent with a role for the protein in the pathogenesis of enterococcal endocarditis. the data demonstrate that asc10 expressed under the control of the nisa promoter in heterologous species will be an useful tool in the detailed characterization of this important enterococcal conjugation protein and virulence factor.

TI  == group b streptococci and other gram-positive cocci bind to cytokeratin 8.
AB  == group b streptococci (gbs) adhere to surface receptors present on epithelial cells; these receptors include fibronectin and laminin. to identify other possible receptors, plasma membranes from a549 cells, a respiratory tract epithelial cell line, were prepared. these plasma membranes were tested in a protein blot analysis using radiolabeled gbs as a probe. gbs adhered to two species, with molecular masses of 50 kda (p50) and 57 kda (p57). we concluded that p50 and p57 correspond to two forms of cytokeratin 8 (ck8) on the basis of the following results: (i) protein blot results demonstrated that p50 and p57 exactly comigrated with two forms of ck8 after separation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (page); (ii) p50 and p57 exactly comigrated with ck8 after separation by two-dimensional page; (iii) ck8 in solution bound to gbs, as demonstrated by immunoblot analysis of proteins from a549 lysates that bound to gbs in a liquid-phase assay; and (iv) radiolabeled gbs bound to a549 lysate-derived ck8 that had been captured in anti-ck8-coated microtiter wells. ck8 bound to coh1-13, an acapsular mutant of coh1, demonstrating that adherence is not mediated by capsular polysaccharide. trypsin-treated gbs did not bind to ck8, indicating that adherence is mediated via a protein on the surface of gbs. soluble ck8 bound to six of six gbs strains  tested. soluble ck8 also bound to staphylococcus aureus, lactococcus lactis, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pyogenes. we hypothesize that adherence  of gbs to cytokeratin may be important for maintenance of colonization at sites of keratinized epithelium, such as the vagina, or for adherence of these bacteria to damaged epithelial cells at other sites.

TI  == antimicrobial activities of mefloquine and a series of related compounds.
AB  == mefloquine was found to have bactericidal activity against methicillin- and fluoroquinolone-susceptible and -resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis and gentamicin- and vancomycin-resistant strains of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium. the mics were 16 microg/ml, and the minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) were 16 to 32 microg/ml. these concentrations cannot be achieved in serum. mefloquine was active at a more achievable concentration against penicillin-susceptible and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, with mics of 0.2 to 1.5 microg/ml. mefloquine was not active against gram-negative bacteria and yeasts. in an attempt to find more active derivatives, 400 mefloquine-related compounds were selected from the chemical inventory of the walter reed army institute of research. we identified a series of compounds containing a piperidine methanol group attached to pyridine,  quinoline, and benzylquinoline ring systems. these had activities similar to that of mefloquine against s. pneumoniae but were far more active against other gram-positive bacteria (mics for staphylococci, 0.8 to 6.3 microg/ml). they had activities similar to that of amphotericin b against candida spp. and cryptococcus neoformans. combinations of the compounds with gentamicin and vancomycin were additive against staphylococci and pneumococci. the mic and mbc of gentamicin were decreased by four- to eightfold when this drug was combined with limiting dilutions of the compounds. there was no antagonism with other antimicrobial drugs. the compounds were rapidly bactericidal. they appear to act  by disrupting cell membranes. combinations of the compounds with aminoglycoside antibiotics may have potential for therapeutic use.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis and arnica montana against oral pathogens.
AB  == arnica and propolis have been used for thousands of years in folk medicine for several purposes. they possess several biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antiviral and tissue regenerative, among others. although the antibacterial activity of propolis has already been demonstrated, very few studies have been done on bacteria of clinical relevance in dentistry. also, the antimicrobial activity of arnica has not been extensively investigated. therefore the aim here was to evaluate in vitro the antimicrobial activity, inhibition of adherence of mutans streptococci and inhibition of formation of water-insoluble glucan by arnica and propolis extracts. arnica montana (10%, w/v) and propolis (10%, w/v) extracts from minas gerais state were compared with controls. fifteen microorganisms were used as follows: candida albicans--ntcc 3736, f72; staphylococcus aureus--atcc 25923; enterococcus faecalis--atcc 29212;  streptococcus sobrinus 6715; strep. sanguis--atcc 10556; strep. cricetus--hs-6; strep. mutans--ingbritt 1600; strep. mutans--omz 175; actinomyces naeslundii--atcc 12104, w 1053; act. viscosus omz 105; porphyromonas gingivalis;  porph. endodontalis and prevotella denticola (the last three were clinical isolates). antimicrobial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. to assess cell adherence to a glass surface, the organisms were grown for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30  degree angle. to assay water-insoluble glucan formation, a mixture of crude glucosyltransferase and 0.125 m sucrose was incubated for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. arnica and propolis extracts (20 microl) were added to these tubes to evaluate the % of inhibition of cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation. the propolis extract significantly inhibited all the microorganisms tested (p < 0.05), showing the largest inhibitory zone for actinomyces spp. the arnica extract did not demonstrate significant antimicrobial activity. cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation were almost completely inhibited by the propolis extract at a final concentration of 400 microg/ml and 500 microg/ml, respectively. the arnica extract showed slight inhibition of the adherence of the growing cells (19% for strep. mutans and 15% for strep. sobrinus) and of water-insoluble glucan formation (29%) at these same  concentrations. thus, the propolis extract showed in vitro antibacterial activity, inhibition of cell adherence and inhibition of water-insoluble glucan formation, while the arnica extract was only slightly active in those three conditions.

TI  == a comparison of antimicrobial resistance rates in gram-positive pathogens isolated in the uk from october 1996 to january 1997 and october 1997 to january  1998.
AB  == rates of resistance for two consecutive years for 28 centres (10 teaching, nine associate teaching and nine district general hospitals) in the uk were compared.  combined rates of resistance for each of the hospital types of staphylococcus aureus to methicillin revealed an increase in the rate of resistance in teaching  hospitals (12.5% year 1, 23.5% year 2), but, for associate teaching and district  general hospitals rates fell (associate teaching 19.1% year 1, 11.9% year 2; district general 16.5% year 1 and 11.3% year 2). using conventional methodology to determine mics, no strain was considered to have reduced susceptibility to vancomycin. among coagulase-negative staphylococci, increased resistance was observed for staphylococcus epidermidis to rifampicin, for staphylococcus haemolyticus to clindamycin, for staphylococcus saprophyticus to penicillin and for staphylococcus spp. to clindamycin, methicillin and rifampicin. for streptococcus pneumoniae an upward trend in low-level resistance to penicillin was observed (18 of the 28 centres), however, for high-level resistance the trend was in the opposite direction (only four centres showed an increase). for enterococcus faecalis there was a trend to a fall in levels of resistance, the only exception being an increase in high-level gentamicin resistance (10.5% year  1, 15.1% year 2, p = 0.0388). for enterococcus faecium rates of resistance were not significantly different except for increases in resistance to nitrofurantoin  and rifampicin.

TI  == [acquired antibiotic resistance in madagascar: first evaluation].
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence of acquired resistance to antibiotics in madagascar. testing was carried out on total of 1267 strains of medically significant bacteria isolated from specimens sent to the pasteur institute of madagascar in antananarivo between october 1997 and october 1998. antibiograms were performed using the diffusion technique on gel media with antibiotic disks. results were read according to the criteria of the antibiogram  committee of the french society of microbiology. preliminary findings documented  a high incidence of resistance to widely available, low-price antibiotics including penicillin g and tetracycline for which 84 p. 100 and 65 p. 100 of staphylococcus aureus respectively demonstrated resistance; tetracyclin to which  80 p. 100 of streptococcus were resistant; and ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, and phenicoles to which 60 p. 100, 60 p. 100 and 28 p. 100 of escherichia coli respectively and 77 p. 100, 83 p. 100, and 71 p. 100 of shigella sp. respectively were resistant. second-line antibiotics including penicillin m, macrolides, nalidixic acid, and nitrofuranes were still relatively active, thus providing an  effective alternative. newly developed antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporines were highly effective but a few resistant strains were observed. although not representative of madagascar as a whole, the  findings of this preliminary study indicate that acquired resistance must be taken into account in designing simplified decision charts for front-line laboratories, that appropriate information must be made available to health care  workers, and that further testing is needed to monitor the evolution of antibiotic resistance.

TI  == the in vitro effects of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate on oral and pharyngeal microorganisms of various ecological niches.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the in vitro susceptibility to cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate for various aerobic and anaerobic micro-organisms responsible for oral and pharyngeal diseases by assessing the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimum bactericidal concentrations  (mbcs) or minimum fungicidal concentrations (mfcs) and by determining kill-times. the mics of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate for 46 tested strains (25 reference strains and 21 clinical isolates) ranged from 8 to 500 micrograms/ml. the mic was found to be 31.25 micrograms/ml for 36% of the reference strains. even lower mic values (15.63 micrograms/ml) were observed for some anaerobic strains, for haemophilus influenzae and for candida tropicalis. mic and mbc values corresponded for the majority of strains tested while the mfc for c. tropicalis and c. albicans was much higher. only 9.5% of the clinical isolates gave a mic value of 31.25 micrograms/ml. enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus showed mic at 62.5 micrograms/ml. the mic and  mbc values among the isolates were comparable, while the mfc value for the yeasts was greater. a concentration of 125 micrograms/ml of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate inhibited the growth of all bacteria, except enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonaceae, and yeasts. cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate shows very rapid kill-time for s. sanguis (0"), and rapid (15") for s. pyogenes, s. dysgalactiae and s. mutans and for moraxella catarrhalis, while a longer kill-time was necessary for the other microbes tested.

TI  == rapid identification of bacteria in blood cultures by using fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide probes.
AB  == the applicability of whole-cell hybridization for the identification of pathogenic bacteria in blood from septic patients was examined. oligonucleotide probes, fluorescently labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate, directed against the variable regions of the 16s rrnas of the following bacterial species and/or genera were used: streptococcus spp., enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the enterobacteriaceae family. a probe specific for the rrnas of  almost all bacteria and its complementary, reversed counterpart was used as positive and negative control, respectively. the probes were used in conjunction  with a fast and simple-to-use protocol for whole-cell hybridization. this protocol yields an identification after 25 to 45 min, depending on whether the bacterium is gram positive or gram negative. a total of 182 blood samples which tested positive in a blood culture machine were investigated. all probes except for the ones for s. aureus and the cons showed sensitivities and specificities of 1.000. it was concluded that whole-cell hybridization is well suited for the fast screening of septic blood containing streptococci and/or enterococci or gram-negative rods.

TI  == quinupristin/dalfopristin: a review of its use in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin is the first parenteral streptogramin antibacterial agent, and is a 30:70 (w/w) ratio of 2 semisynthetic pristinamycin derivatives. the combination has inhibitory activity against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref), drug-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, other streptococci, clostridium perfringens and peptostreptococcus spp. the combination also has good activity against selected gram-negative respiratory tract pathogens including moraxella catarrhalis, legioniella pneumophila and mycoplasma pneumoniae. quinupristin/dalfopristin has poor activity against e. faecalis. the  combination is bactericidal against staphylococci and streptococci, although constitutive erythromycin resistance can affect its activity. as for many other agents, quinupristin/dalfopristin is generally bacteriostatic against e. faecium. in patients with methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) or vref infections participating in prospective emergency-use trials, quinupristin/dalfopristin 7.5  mg/kg every 8 or 12 hours achieved clinical or bacteriological success in > or =64% of patients. emergence of resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin was uncommon (4% of patients) in those with vref infections. quinupristin/dalfopristin 7.5 mg/kg 8- or 12-hourly also achieved similar clinical success rates to comparator agents in patients with presumed gram-positive complicated skin and skin structure infections or nosocomial pneumonia (administered in combination with aztreoman) in 3 large multicentre randomised trials. systemic adverse events associated with quinupristin/dalfopristin include gastrointestinal events (nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea), rash and pruritus. myalgias and arthralgias also occur at an overall  incidence of 1.3%, although higher rates (2.5 to 31%) have been reported in patients with multiple comorbidities. venous events are common if the drug is administered via a peripheral line; however, several management options (e.g. use of central venous access, increased infusion volume) may help to minimise their occurrence. hyperbilirubinaemia has been documented in 3.1% of quinupristin/dalfopristin recipients versus 1.3% of recipients of comparator agents. quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibits cytochrome p450 3a4 and therefore has  the potential to increase the plasma concentrations of substrates of this enzyme. conclusions: quinupristin/dalfopristin, the first parenteral streptogramin, offers a unique spectrum of activity against multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria. in serious gram-positive infections for which there are other treatment options available, the spectrum of activity and efficacy of quinupristin/ dalfopristin should be weighed against its tolerability and drug interaction profile. however, in vref or unresponsive mrsa infections, where few proven treatment options exist, quinupristin/dalfopristin should be considered as a treatment of choice for these seriously ill patients.

TI  == characterization of 'faecal streptococci' as indicators of faecal pollution and distribution in the environment.
AB  == the recent revision of the taxonomy of 'faecal streptococci' prompted us to verify the importance of identifying the species of this group of cocci. during a study carried out to assess the hygienic quality of environmental samples from a  variety of sources, we isolated 198 strains named faecal streptococci on the basis of conventional international tests (eva broth multiple tube test) used for public health purposes. the predominant species were enterococcus faecalis (39%)  and ent. faecium (29%), followed by ent. durans/hirae, ent. casseliflavus/gallinarum, ent. raffinosus, with a different prevalence of the species depending on the source. eighty-four per cent of isolates were true faecal species. only one isolate was identified as belonging to the streptococcus genus. the authors stress the opportunity to identify the species. this may help  to clarify the ecological and epidemiological characteristics of intestinal enterococci and streptococci in the environment, in drinking and recreational waters and their meaning as indicators of faecal pollution. all isolates were tested for their susceptibility to some antimicrobial agents widely used in medical therapy and the pattern was compared with the pattern of isolates from clinical specimens.

AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin (synercid) is a new injectable streptogramin antibiotic proposed for the treatment of severe antimicrobial infections, that has been shown to be active against gram-positive, multi-resistant cocci. we compared the  in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin with that of amoxycillin, ampicillin, penicillin, cefixime, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, erythromycin, imipenem, meropenem, oxacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, teicoplanin and vancomycin. the susceptibility of 37 staphylococcus aureus (14 ms, 23 mr), 26 staphylococcus epidermidis (16 ms, 10 mr), 20 streptococcus pneumoniae, 33 group  a streptococcus pyogenes, 15 streptococcus agalactiae, 10 enterococcus faecalis (1 vancomycin-resistant), 15 enterococcus faecium (9 van a) was evaluated. quinupristin/dalfopristin was active against all gram-positive species tested, including met-r s. aureus (mic < or = 2 mg/l), met-r s. epidermidis (mic < or = 2 mg/l), s. pneumoniae (mic < or = 1 mg/l), ery-r and ery-s streptococci (mic < or  = 1 mg/l). the strains of e. faecalis were generally less susceptible. time-kill  studies confirmed that quinupristin/dalfopristin at 4 x mic concentration showed  a complete bactericidal effect (3 log reduction) in about 4 6 h against all strains tested. a post-antibiotic effect (pae) of 3.9-5.2 h was observed at 4 x mic concentration of quinupristin/dalfopristin against staphylococci. a prolonged pae was obtained for s. pneumoniae (8 h), s. pyogenes (9 h) and s. agalactiae (7  h), while the shortest pae was seen for e. faecalis and e. faecium (about 4 h).

TI  == an escherichia coli-enterococcus faecalis shuttle vector as a tool for the construction of a group b streptococcus heterologous mutant expressing the beta antigen (bac) of the c protein complex.
AB  == group b streptococci (gbs) represent a very important group of human pathogens. so far little is known about the mechanisms by which these bacteria can cause disease and the bacterial factors involved. one putative virulence factor is the  beta antigen of the c protein complex (bac), which can bind to the fc region of human iga. its binding function might represent an important virulence mechanism. however, the genetic manipulation of this group of bacteria, necessary to prove involvement of bacterial factors in pathogenesis, is still in its infancy. we therefore tested the pam401 vector system for its suitability in the construction of a heterologous expression mutant using the bac protein as a model antigen. the bac gene, including its own promoter, was cloned into the escherichia coli-enterococcus faecalis shuttle vector pam401 and was stably maintained extrachromosomally in the bac-deficient gbs strain 335. expression of bac was assessed by extracting the protein from transformed 335(ppjtu1) cells, negative controls (335 wild-type, 335(pam401)) and other bac-expressing gbs strains (a909, la239). blots of the extracted proteins probed with iga, polyclonal sera and a monoclonal antibody raised against bac clearly revealed expression of the 130-kda protein in the transformed gbs 335(ppjtu1) cells. the correct processing and surface anchoring of the expressed bac was demonstrated by binding of (125)i-labelled iga to whole cells. strain 335(ppjtu1) bound 12 times as much iga compared to the parental strain la239 and the gbs 335 negative controls, and a total of 25% compared to the high-level-expressing strain a909. our studies show  that the pam401 shuttle vector can be used for stable heterologous expression of  surface proteins in gbs. our strategy is also of major importance for the complementation of deletion mutants in gbs and other gram-positive human pathogens to fulfill koch's postulates. the bac mutant constructed in this study, 335(ppjtu1), can be used in animal models to assess the importance of bac in gbs  pathogenesis.

TI  == the synthesis and antibacterial activity of totarol derivatives. part 1: modifications of ring-c and pro-drugs.
AB  == a series of analogues of, and potential pro-drugs derived from, the potent antibacterial diterpene totarol (1) were synthesized in order to elucidate the minimum structural requirements for antibacterial activity and to seek compounds  with good bioavailability in vivo. these analogues varied in the structural features of their aromatic rings and the prodrugs were o-glycosylated derivatives. they were tested in vitro against three gram-positive bacteria: beta-lactamase-positive and high level gentamycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa); and against the gram-negative multi-drug-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae. none of the analogues was more potent than totarol itself, which is effective against these gram-positive bacteria at mic values of 7 microm. the results were evaluated in terms of a structure-activity relationship and this showed that a phenolic moiety was essential for potent antibacterial activity. amongst the pro-drugs, totaryl alpha-d-mannopyranoside (22) proved the most active in vitro (mic 18 microm). the in vivo antibacterial activities of compounds 1, 22 and totarol beta-lactoside (23) were assessed in a mouse model of infection, but they were found to be ineffective. compounds 1 and 22 were shown to be cytotoxic towards proliferating  human cell cultures, ch 2983, hela, and mg 63, but only at concentrations of > 30 microm.

TI  == antimicrobial evaluation of calcium hydroxide in infected dentinal tubules.
AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide in infected dentinal tubules. four microorganisms, strains of atcc (streptococcus faecalis (atcc-29212), staphylococcus aureus (atcc-6538), bacillus subtilis (atcc-6633), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc-27853)) and one mixture of these were used. these strains were inoculated in brain heart infusion (bhi) and  incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h. sixty-three human maxillary central incisors  were prepared and sterilized by autoclaving. five groups of 12 teeth each were contaminated for 28 days using new 24-h cultures every 72 h, prepared and adjusted to tube 2 of the macfarland scale (6 x 10(8) cells/ml). root canals were then irrigated with 5 ml of saline, dried, and completely filled with calcium hydroxide paste. at intervals of 0, 48, and 72 h, and 7 days, dressings were removed and teeth were immersed in 5 ml of bhi and incubated at 37 degrees c for  48 h to observe the growth and multiplication of the microorganisms. three uninoculated teeth were maintained in a humid environment as an aseptic control.  these teeth were immersed in bhi and maintained at 37 degrees c for 7 days to determine microbial growth. bacterial growth was shown by turbidity of the culture medium and confirmed by seeding these broths on bhi agar at 37 degrees c  for 24 h. the positive bhi tubes were selected, and inoculum was spread on the surface of bhi agar, followed by the same incubation conditions. gram stain was conducted from bhi growth and from colonies growing on solid medium. calcium hydroxide in infected dentinal tubules showed no antimicrobial effect on s. faecalis, s. aureus, b. subtilis, p. aeruginosa, or on the bacterial mixture used throughout the experiment.

AB  == the in vitro activity of fk041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with  those of cefdinir (cfdn) and cefditoren (cdtr). fk041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk041 was active against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms  except enterococcus faecalis with mic90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. fk041 was more active than cfdn and cdtr against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to cfdn and cdtr against streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. fk041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae with an mic range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to cfdn but inferior to cdtr. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative organisms such as neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis, fk041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of cfdn and cdtr. however, it was inferior to cdtr in activity against moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, morganella morganii, and serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. with fk041 a small difference between mic and mbc against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and h. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. fk041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. the stability of fk041 to these enzymes was similar to those of cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) of s. aureus (pbp 3, 2, and 1) and e. coli (pbp 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).

TI  == cloning and expression of the pediocin operon in streptococcus thermophilus and other lactic fermentation bacteria.
AB  == production of pediocin in pediococcus acidilactici is associated with pmbr1.0, which encodes prepediocin, a pediocin immunity protein, and two proteins involved in secretion and precursor processing. these four genes are organized as an operon under control of a single promoter. we have constructed shuttle vectors that contain all four structural genes, the chromosomal promoter st(p2201) from streptococcus thermophilus, and repa from the 2-kbp s. thermophilus plasmid per8. the recombinant plasmid, ppc318, expressed and secreted active pediocin in escherichia coli. streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, and enterococcus faecalis were electrotransformed with ppc418, a modified vector  fitted with an erythromycin resistance tracking gene. pediocin was produced and secreted in each of the lactic acid bacteria, and production was stable for up to ten passages. the expression of pediocin in dairy fermentation microbes has important implications for bacteriocins as food preservatives in dairy products.

TI  == characterization of enterococcus faecalis alkaline phosphatase and use in identifying streptococcus agalactiae secreted proteins.
AB  == we have identified and characterized an enterococcus faecalis alkaline phosphatase (ap, encoded by phoz). the predicted gene product shows homology with alkaline phosphatases from a variety of species; it has especially high similarity with two alkaline phosphatases from bacillus subtilis. expression of phoz in escherichia coli, e. faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus [gbs]), or streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus [gas]) produces a blue-colony phenotype on plates containing a chromogenic substrate, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate (xp or bcip). two tests were made to determine if the activity of the enzyme is dependent upon the enzyme's subcellular location. first, elimination of the signal sequence reduced ap activity to 3% of the wild-type activity (or less) in three species of gram-positive bacteria. restoration of export, using the signal sequence from c5a peptidase, restored ap activity to at least 50% of that of the wild type. second, we engineered two chimeric proteins in which ap was fused to either a periplasmic domain or a cytoplasmic domain of lactose permease (a membrane protein). in e. coli, the periplasmic fusion had 17-fold-higher ap activity than the cytoplasmic  fusion. we concluded that ap activity is export dependent. the signal sequence deletion mutant, phozdeltass, was used to identify random genomic fragments from  gbs that encode exported proteins or integral membrane proteins. included in this set of fragments were genes that exhibited homology with the rib protein (a cell  wall protein from gbs) or with dppb (an integral membrane protein from gas). ap acts as a reporter enzyme in gbs, gas, and e. faecalis and is expected to be useful in a variety of gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents: special references to bacteria isolated between july 1996 and june 1997].
AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 20 facilities in japan since july 1982. this paper describes the results obtained during period from july 1996 to june 1997. the number of cases investigated as objectives was 217 for one year. a total of 406 strains were isolated from 177 cases (81.6% of total cases). from primary infections 162 strains were isolated,  and from postoperative infections 244 strains were isolated, respectively. from primary infections, anaerobic bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. was the highest.  in postoperative infections, the majority of them were enterococcus faecalis, while in primary infections, many of them were enterococcus avium. the isolation  rate of staphylococcus spp., especially from postoperative infections, followed that of enterococcus spp. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, peptostreptococcus spp. and streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by e. coli and enterobacter cloacae. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. the isolation rate of aerobic gram-negative bacillus has decreased with time, while those of anaerobes like b. fragilis group and of aerobic gram-positive bacteria have gradually increased in both types of infections. we found vancomycin-resistant strains of neither staphylacoccus aureus nor enterococcus spp.; however, the mic of arbekacin for one of strains of s. aureus  was 100 micrograms/ml. both the mic90's of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin against p. aeruginosa isolated in this term were 25 micrograms/ml, which were higher than those against the strains isolated in the previous years. compared with the isolated strains in the year 1995, progress of resistance against carbapenem antibiotics was confirmed.

TI  == interspecies recombination between enterococci: genetic and phenotypic diversity  of vancomycin-resistant transconjugants.
AB  == handwerger and colleagues demonstrated that a particular clinical isolate of enterococcus faecium, designated guc, and here redesignated as gucr, can conjugatively transfer vancomycin resistance. the vancomycin resistance is encoded by a chromosomally born linked set of genes in the donor, designated the  vana cluster, to the chromosome of an e. faecalis recipient, jh2-2. here it is reported that an earlier isolate of e. faecium from the same patient who later harbored the vancomycin-resistant e. faecium gucr lacks the vana gene cluster but is otherwise similar (by smai chromosomal fingerprint and metabolic fingerprinting) to the vancomycin-resistant gucr. therefore, "gucs" is a strong suspect as the base strain for the clinical acquisition of the vana cluster present in gucr. thirteen laboratory-generated vana transconjugants derived from  conjugation between gucr and jh2-2 were subjected to further analysis, allowing a comparison between transfer in the laboratory and transfer that occurred in the clinical setting. surprisingly, each jh2-2 transconjugant had a unique constellation of abilities to oxidize various members of a panel of potential carbon sources. this pattern was stable for each transconjugant, and it was not changed by growing the strains with or without vancomycin. transconjugants had pulsed-field gel electrophoretic (pfge) patterns largely consistent with that of  jh2-2, the recipient in conjugation experiments. however, pfge analysis showed that a large but variable amount of dna, between 145 kb and 277 kb, was transferred into different transconjugants. the mechanism appears to be conjugative transposition in which new dna is added to the pre-existing genome rather than substituting for a segment in the recipient. mapping and hybridization studies of several transconjugants showed that each received similar, but not exactly the same, dna fragment of at least 30 kb from the donor. sequencing of 16s ribosomal genes was used to confirm that the recipient and donor strains used in transconjugation experiments were different species. sequence analysis was also used to consider the possibility that rrna operons might be mobilized in conjugation, but no evidence for the transfer of rdna operons was found. an apparent insertion sequence in e. faecium almost identical  to is 1485 and 57% sequence identity to is 199 of streptococcus mutans was found  in the region of dna transferred. the results imply new consequences of conjugative transfer and interspecies recombination.

TI  == alpha-functionalized phosphonylphosphinates: synthesis and evaluation as transcarbamoylase inhibitors.
AB  == diverse alpha-methyl-substituted phosphonylphosphinates (p-c-p-c-x) are accessible from a protected, pentafluorophenylsulfonated phosphonylphosphinate via nucleophilic displacement. the utility of this route is demonstrated with several nitrogen nucleophiles. the resulting amine and amino acid phosphonylphosphinate derivatives were evaluated as inhibitors of streptococcus faecalis ornithine transcarbamoylase (otc). compared with the structurally related phosphonoacetyl-l-ornithine (l-palo), a known inhibitor of otcs from various sources, the phosphonylphosphinates are surprisingly poor inhibitors, binding several orders of magnitude less tightly to the enzyme. these results suggest that the tetrahedral intermediate formed in the normal transcarbamoylase  reaction is poorly mimicked by a tetrahedral and anionic phosphonate, either because of directly unfavorable interactions with a hydrogen-bond acceptor within the active site or because transition-state analogues are unable to induce the protein conformation changes that normally accompany reaction.

AB  == we determined the sequence and genetic organization of plasmid pip823, which contains the dfrd gene; dfrd confers high-level trimethoprim resistance to listeria monocytogenes bm4293 by synthesis of dihydrofolate reductase type s2. pip823 possessed all the features of the pub110/pc194 plasmid family, whose members replicate by the rolling-circle mechanism. the rep gene encoded a protein identical to repu, the protein required for initiation of the replication of plasmids ptb913 from a thermophilic bacillus sp. and pub110 from staphylococcus aureus. the mob gene encoded a protein with a high degree of amino acid identity  with the mob proteins involved in conjugative mobilization and interplasmidic recombination of ptb913 and pub110. the host range of pip823 was broad and included l. monocytogenes, enterococcus faecalis, s. aureus, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli. in all these species, pip823 replicated by generating single-stranded dna and was stable. conjugative mobilization of pip823 was obtained by self-transferable plasmids between l. monocytogenes and e. faecalis,  between l. monocytogenes and e. coli, and between strains of e. coli, and by the  streptococcal conjugative transposon tn1545 from l. monocytogenes to e. faecalis, and from l. monocytogenes and e. faecalis to e. coli. these data indicate that the gene flux observed in nature from gram-positive to gram-negative bacteria can occur by conjugative mobilization. our results suggest that dissemination of trimethoprim resistance in listeria spp. and acquisition of other antibiotic resistance determinants in this species can be anticipated.

TI  == lacticin 3147 displays activity in buffer against gram-positive bacterial pathogens which appear insensitive in standard plate assays.
AB  == lacticin 3147 is a broad-spectrum bacteriocin produced by lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis dpc3147, which has been shown to be active against a range of food-borne bacteria. the reported inhibitory range for lacticin is extended to include methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, penicillin-resistant pneumococcus, propionibacterium acne  and streptococcus mutans. this extended host range is not obvious from traditional agar plate-based methods, but reductions in bacterial cell numbers by up to 6 log10 cfu ml-1 was observed after 2 h in time-kill curve studies conducted in broth, suggesting that the bacteriocin may have potential as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of human infections.

TI  == infective endocarditis: an epidemiological review of 128 episodes.
AB  == objectives: the objective was to determine the current epidemiology of infective  endocarditis. patients and methods: all microbiologically positive episodes of infective endocarditis treated at the university hospital of wales over a 9-year  period from march 1987 to march 1996 was reviewed. patients originated from the catchment area of the university hospital of wales or were referred from other hospitals in wales. data extraction was from records held in the microbiology department and, whenever possible, from patients' casenotes. the epidemiological  parameters were: (1) age and sex of patients; (2) distribution of affected sites; (3) frequency of predisposing risk factors (cardiac and extracardiac); (4) incidence of early prosthetic valve endocarditis; and (5) mortality rates. results: there were 128 microbiologically positive episodes of endocarditis in 125 patients. the mean age of the population was 53.1 years and the aortic valve  was the most frequently involved site of infection (51.6%). a presumed source of  infection was identified in 20% if episodes. the commonest predisposing cardiac risk factor in native valve episodes was bicuspid aortic valve (16.7%) but there  was no identifiable cardiac risk factor in a much larger proportion (37.7%) of native valve episodes. there was a low incidence (0.6%) of culture positive early prosthetic valve episodes and low mortality rates for both native and prosthetic  valve endocarditis (12.3% and 24.5%) in this study. viridans streptococci were the predominant organisms. in prosthetic valve episodes with onset after the 60th postoperative day but within one postoperative year the identity of the isolate suggested, in most cases, perioperative valve contamination. conclusions: the epidemiology of infective endocarditis has undergone significant change. inability to detect clinically common predisposing lesions, and the frequent absence of any identifiable predisposing cardiac risk factor mean that initial diagnosis is often difficult and demands a high index of suspicion. there was a low incidence of culture positive early prosthetic valve episodes and there were  low mortality rates for both native and prosthetic valve endocarditis; these figures suggest improvements in cardiac care. the microbiological evidence indicates that the duration of the postoperative time period used for classifying prosthetic valve endocarditis into 'early' and 'late' episodes should be extended from 60 days to 1 year.

TI  == cell wall-anchored csha polypeptide (259 kilodaltons) in streptococcus gordonii forms surface fibrils that confer hydrophobic and adhesive properties.
AB  == it has been shown previously that inactivation of the csha gene, encoding a major cell surface polypeptide (259 kda) in the oral bacterium streptococcus gordonii,  generates mutants that are markedly reduced in hydrophobicity, deficient in binding to oral actinomyces species and to human fibronectin, and unable to colonize the oral cavities of mice. we now show further that surface fibrils 60.7 +/- 14.5 nm long, which are present on wild-type s. gordonii dl1 (challis) cells, bind csha-specific antibodies and are absent from the cell surfaces of csha mutants. to more precisely determine the structural and functional properties of  csha, already inferred from insertional-mutagenesis experiments, we have cloned the entire csha gene into the replicative plasmid pam401 and expressed full-length csha polypeptide on the cell surface of heterologous enterococcus faecalis jh2-2. enterococci expressing csha exhibited a 30-fold increase in cell  surface hydrophobicity over e. faecalis jh2-2 carrying the pam401 vector alone and 2.4-fold-increased adhesion to human fibronectin. csha expression in e. faecalis also promoted cell-cell aggregation and increased the ability of enterococci to bind actinomyces naeslundii cells. electron micrographs of negatively stained e. faecalis cells expressing csha showed peritrichous surface  fibrils 70.3 +/- 9.1 nm long that were absent from control e. faecalis jh2-2(pam401) cells. the fibrils bound csha-specific antibodies, as detected by immunoelectron microscopy, and the antibodies inhibited the adhesion of e. faecalis cells to fibronectin. the results demonstrate that the csha polypeptide  is the structural and functional component of s. gordonii adhesive fibrils, and they provide a molecular basis for past correlations of surface fibril production, cell surface hydrophobicity, and adhesion in species of oral "sanguis-like" streptococci.

TI  == clpe, a novel type of hsp100 atpase, is part of the ctsr heat shock regulon of bacillus subtilis.
AB  == clp atpases, which include the ubiquitous hsp100 family, are classified according to their structural features and sequence similarities. during the course of the  bacillus subtilis genome sequencing project, we identified a gene encoding a new  member of the hsp100 family. we designated this protein clpe, as it is the prototype of a novel subfamily among the clp atpases, and have identified homologues in several bacteria, including listeria monocytogenes, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, lactobacillus sakei and clostridium acetobutylicum. a unique feature of these hsp100-type clp atpases is their amino-terminal zinc finger motif. unlike the other class iii genes of b. subtilis (clpc and clpp ), clpe does not appear to be required for stress tolerance. transcriptional analysis revealed two sigmaa-type promoters, expression from which was shown to be inducible by heat shock and puromycin treatment. investigation of the regulatory mechanism controlling clpe expression  indicates that this gene is controlled by ctsr and is thus a member of the class  iii heat shock genes of b. subtilis. ctsr negatively regulates clpe expression by binding to the promoter region, in which five ctsr binding sites were identified  through dnase i footprinting and sequence analysis.

TI  == bloodstream infections in a neonatal intensive-care unit: 12 years' experience with an antibiotic control program.
AB  == objective: to assess the prevalence of gram-positive coccal (gpc), gram-negative  bacillary (gnb), and fungal blood-stream infections (bsis) during a 12-year period in which a consistent antibiotic treatment protocol was in place; to evaluate the efficacy of these antibiotic policies in relation to treatment, to the emergence of bacterial or fungal resistance, and to the occurrence of infection outbreaks or epidemics. study design: case series. methods: demographic, clinical, and bacteriological information from 363 infants born during 1986 through 1991 and 1992 through 1997 who developed 433 blood-culture-proven bsis was analyzed. early-onset bsis were defined as those infections discovered within 48 hours of birth, and late-onset bsis as those that occurred thereafter. suspected early-onset bsis were treated with ampicillin and  gentamicin, and suspected late-onset bsis with vancomycin and gentamicin. antibiotics were changed on the basis of organism antimicrobial susceptibility. results: early-onset bsis were noted in 52 of 21,336 live births and 40 of 20,402 live births during 1986 through 1991 and 1992 through 1997, respectively. gpc (83% due to group b streptococcus [gbs]) accounted for approximately one half of  early-onset bsi cases and gnb (68% enterobacteriaceae) for the remainder. early-onset gbs declined from 24 to 11 cases (p=.04) and late-onset bsi increased from 111 to 230 cases (p<.01) from the first to the last study period. sixty-eight percent of late-onset bsis were due to gpc (primarily coagulase-negative staphylococcus), 18% to gnb, and 14% to fungus. over the study period, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from the newborn intensivecare unit (unlike those strains from other hospital units) remained fully susceptible to ceftazidime and  gentamicin. although the hospitalwide prevalence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus increased, all 17 newborn bsi cases were due to methicillin-sensitive strains. prevalence of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococcus increased, although all strains remained vancomycin-susceptible, as did the 16 enterococcus faecalis isolates. all fungi recovered (from 48 patients) were susceptible to amphotericin. conclusion: we observed a decrease in the prevalence of early-onset bsis due to gbs and an increase in late-onset bsis due to gpc, gnb, and fungi. the combination of ampicillin and gentamicin for suspected early-onset bsis and vancomycin and gentamicin for late-onset bsis has been successful for treatment of individual patients without the occurrence of infection outbreaks or the emergence of resistance. controlled antibiotic programs and periodic evaluations based on individual unit and not on hospitalwide antibiograms are advisable.

TI  == an operon that confers uv resistance by evoking the sos mutagenic response in streptococcal conjugative transposon tn5252.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae rx1 is capable of repairing lesions caused by dna-damaging agents in an error-free manner but lacks a uv-inducible error-prone  repair system due to the absence of chromosomally encoded umudc-like proteins. we have identified an operon-like structure 8 kb from the left end of the pneumococcal conjugative transposon tn5252 that confers sos function in the host  cells. dna sequence analysis of this region revealed the presence of four open reading frames (orfs). the deduced amino acid sequence of one of them, orf13, which is capable of encoding a protein of 49.7 kda, showed significant homology to umuc, mucb, and other proteins involved in the sos response. the carboxy-terminal region of another, orf14, which is predicted to encode a 26-kda  polypeptide, shared similarity with umud- and muca-like proteins that carry the amino acid residues recognized by the activated reca* protein for proteolytic cleavage. the presence of plasmids carrying subcloned dna from this region was found to restore uv-inducible mutagenic repair of chromosomal dna in escherichia  coli cells defective in error-prone repair as well as in pneumococcus and enterococcus faecalis uv202. mutations within orf13 abolished uv-induced mutagenesis but did not affect the conjugal transposition of the element.

TI  == cation movements at alkaline ph in bacteria growing without respiration.
AB  == the respiratory chain has a central role in energy metabolism as a generator of a proton motive force in aerobic bacteria. in contrast, enterococcus hirae (formerly streptococcus faecalis), which lacks the respiratory chain, generates this proton gradient via a f-type h+ atpase, but it works only at a ph below 8; no significant proton motive force is generated at a ph above 8. an escherichia coli mutant deficient in both the respiratory chain and the h+ atpase grew with a negligible proton motive force within the wide range of medium ph. it has been suggested that both e. hirae and e. coli are able to grow even when the cytoplasm is alkalinized beyond ph 8. these observations lead to the conclusion that bacteria can survive without operating cation transport systems driven by a proton motive force at alkaline ph. the activity of any transport system with optimum ph around neutrality should decline when both the outside and inside of cells are alkalinized. thus, changes in transport systems as well as cellular metabolism may be essential for bacterial adaptation to changes in environmental  ph.

AB  == secretory immunoglobulin a (siga) antibodies reactive with the pioneer oral streptococci streptococcus mitis biovar 1 and streptococcus oralis, the late oral colonizer streptococcus mutans, and the pioneer enteric bacterium enterococcus faecalis in saliva samples from 10 human infants from birth to age 2 years were analyzed. low levels of salivary siga1 and siga2 antibodies reactive with whole cells of all four species were detected within the first month after birth, even  though s. mutans and e. faecalis were not recovered from the mouths of the infants during the study period. although there was a fivefold increase in the concentration of siga between birth and age 2 years, there were no differences between the concentrations of siga1 and siga2 antibodies reactive with the four species over this time period. when the concentrations of siga1 and siga2 antibodies reactive with all four species were normalized to the concentrations of siga1 and siga2 in saliva, siga1 and siga2 antibodies reactive with these bacteria showed a significant decrease from birth to 2 years of age. adsorption of each infant's saliva with cells of one species produced a dramatic reduction of antibodies recognizing the other three species. sequential adsorption of saliva samples removed all siga antibody to the bacteria, indicating that the siga antibodies were directed to antigens shared by all four species. the induction by the host of a limited immune response to common antigens that are likely not involved in adherence may be among the mechanisms that commensal streptococci employ to persist in the oral cavity.

AB  == chlorhexidine (chx) and hydrogen peroxide (hp) are potent antibacterial agents that are used in controlling dental plaque. however, both agents bear undesired side-effects. we have tested the hypothesis that an antibacterial synergistic effect can occur between the two agents against streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus. we have found that at several combinations of hp and chx an antibacterial synergistic effect does occur, while  at other combinations a on-significant synergism was noticed. no antagonism between the two agents was found in our experimental system. it can be postulated that the mechanism of this synergistic effect is via alteration of the bacterial  cell-surface by chx thereby allowing for an increased amount of hp to penetrate and to react with the intercellular organelles of the bacteria. these results suggest that chx and hp can be of use in controlling the dental plaque in the oral cavity.

TI  == ctsr, a novel regulator of stress and heat shock response, controls clp and molecular chaperone gene expression in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == clpp and clpc of bacillus subtillis encode subunits of the clp atp-dependent protease and are required for stress survival, including growth at high temperature. they play essential roles in stationary phase adaptive responses such as the competence and sporulation developmental pathways, and belong to the  so-called class iii group of heat shock genes, whose mode of regulation is unknown and whose expression is induced by heat shock or general stress conditions. the product of ctsr, the first gene of the clpc operon, has now been  shown to act as a repressor of both clpp and clpc, as well as clpe, which encodes a novel member of the hsp100 clp atpase family. the ctsr protein was purified and shown to bind specifically to the promoter regions of all three clp genes. random mutagenesis, dnasel footprinting and dna sequence deletions and comparisons were  used to define a consensus ctsr recognition sequence as a directly repeated heptad upstream from the three clp genes. this target sequence was also found upstream from clp and other heat shock genes of several gram-positive bacteria, including listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus salivarius, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. thermophilus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, leuconostoc oenos, lactobacillus sake, lactococcus lactis and clostridium acetobutylicum. ctsr homologues were also identified in several of these bacteria, indicating that heat shock regulation by ctsr is highly conserved in gram-positive bacteria.

AB  == m-enterococcus agar (m-ent) has been generally considered the reference medium for faecal streptococci in bathing waters. however, it shows several shortcomings, and therefore it is important to test newly developed media that can guarantee more precise results. in this sense, the recently described oxolinic acid--esculin--azide agar medium (oaa) and m-enterococcus agar (m-ent) were comparatively evaluated for the detection of faecal streptococci from seawater and fresh water. the oaa medium showed a significantly higher relative recovery percentage and specificity for both types of water than m-ent. a similar spectrum of species was recorded from both media, enterococcus faecium being predominant in fresh water and enterococcus faecalis, in seawater. the superior performance of the oaa medium in both types of bathing waters, added to the fact  that it does not require the use of complementary confirmative tests, makes this  medium an excellent candidate to be employed for monitoring programmes.

TI  == [estimation of probiotics by infection model of infant rabbit with enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7].
AB  == we examined the preventative effect against enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7 (ehec) infection in rabbits on administration of probiotics contained in  streptococcus faecalis, clostridium butyricum and bacillus mesentericus. the probiotics were administered to 5 days old japanese white rabbits throughout the  experiment. inoculation of 10(6) colony forming units (cfus) of ehec per rabbit was tried 8 days after birth. three days after ehec inoculation, in the control group (not administered probiotics), diarrhea was observed in approximately 80% of the rabbits, on the other hand, in the group administered probiotics, rabbits  showed diarrhea in 15%. in necropsy, the number of ehec in the contents of the cecum and the number of attaching and effacing (ae) lesions were fewer in the probiotics group than in the control group. these results suggest that infant rabbits are useful as a colitis model for ehec, and the probiotics are effective  for the prevention of the growth of ehec in the intestine and for diarrhea.

TI  == enzyme level of enterococcal f1fo-atpase is regulated by ph at the step of assembly.
AB  == the amount of f1fo-atpase in enterococcus hirae (formerly streptococcus faecalis) increases when the cytoplasmic ph is lowered below 7.6, and protons are extruded  to maintain the cytoplasmic ph at around 7.6. in the present study, we found that the transcriptional activity of the f1fo-atpase operon was not regulated by ph. the synthesis of f1 subunits was increased 1.65 +/- 0.12-fold by the acidification of medium from ph 8.0 to ph 5.3. western-blot analysis showed that  there were f1 subunits in the cytoplasm, and the number of alpha plus beta subunits in the cytoplasm was 50% of the total number of the subunits in cells growing at ph 8.0. this decreased to 22% after shifting the medium ph to 5.3, with a concomitant 5.1-fold increase in the level of membrane-bound f1fo-atpase.  the cytoplasmic f1 subunits were shown to be degraded, and fo subunits not assembled into the intact f1fo complex were suggested to be digested. these data  suggest that regulation of the enzyme level of f1fo-atpase by the intracellular ph takes place mainly at the step of enzyme assembly from its subunits.

TI  == hydration of linoleic acid by bacteria isolated from ruminants.
AB  == two strains of enterococcus faecalis isolated from the ovine rumen and known to hydrate oleic acid were shown to transform linoleic acid by hydration into two products. the products, identified as 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid and 13-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid, were formed during stationary phase in yields of  13% and 6% respectively. yields increased to 22% and 14% when culture conditions  were optimised. to our knowledge, this is the first report of 13-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid production by bacteria. during a search for further linoleic-acid-hydrating bacteria, a strain of streptococcus bovis isolated from bovine faeces and the ruminal strain s. bovis jb1 were found to hydrate linoleic acid. both strains formed only one product and the most rapid appearance occurred during exponential growth. the s. bovis product, identified as 13-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid, formed in a yield of 28%. this study provides  the first information on linoleic acid hydration by ruminal bacteria.

TI  == infection-derived enterococcus faecalis strains are enriched in esp, a gene encoding a novel surface protein.
AB  == we report the identification of a new cell wall-associated protein of enterococcus faecalis. studies on the distribution of the gene encoding this novel surface protein, esp, reveal a significant (p < 0.001) enrichment in infection-derived e. faecalis isolates. interestingly, the esp gene was not identified in any of 34 clinical e. faecium isolates or in 4 other less pathogenic enterococcal species tested. analysis of the structural gene among various e. faecalis isolates reveals the existence of alternate forms of expression of the esp protein. the deduced primary structure of the esp protein from strain mmh594, inferred to be 1,873 amino acids (aa) with a predicted mass of approximately 202 kda, reveals a core region consisting of repeat units that make up 50% of the protein. esp bears global organizational similarity to the rib and c alpha proteins of group b streptococci. identity among esp, rib, and c alpha proteins is strikingly localized to a stretch of 13 aa within repeats of similar length. the high degree of conservation of this 13-residue sequence suggests that it plays an important role in the natural selection for this trait  among infection-derived e. faecalis and group b streptococcal isolates.

TI  == streptococcus pyogenes protein f promotes invasion of hela cells.
AB  == although the gram-positive bacterium streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus) has been considered an extracellular pathogen which adheres to human mucosal epithelium, the streptococcus possesses invasive capacity for cultured human epithelial cells. this study provides genetic and functional evidence supporting the conclusion that protein f is capable of mediating entry of s. pyogenes into hela cells. using tn916 insertion mutagenesis or an isogenic  s. pyogenes strain with a defined mutation in the gene encoding protein f (prtf), it was observed that the invasive capacity was affected by the levels of surface-exposed protein f, but not by those of m protein. in addition, heterologous expression of protein f on enterococcus faecalis conferred upon the  bacteria an efficient invasive phenotype. several assays demonstrated that both the fibronectin-binding domains of protein f, ur and rd2, were involved in host-cell invasion. in addition, coinfection experiments of hela cells with s. pyogenes and an escherichia coli k-12 strain expressing an afimbrial adhesin afa-i showed that the uptake of s. pyogenes did not permit internalization of the e. coli cells.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of opc-20011, a novel parenteral broad-spectrum 2-oxaisocephem antibiotic.
AB  == opc-20011, a new parenteral 2-oxaisocephem antibiotic, has an oxygen atom at the  2- position of the cephalosporin frame. opc-20011 had the best antibacterial activities against gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), enterococcus faecalis, and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae: mics at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited were 6.25, 6.25, and 0.05 microg/ml, respectively. its activity is due to a high affinity of the penicillin-binding protein 2' in mrsa, an affinity which was approximately 1,050 times as high as that for flomoxef. against gram-negative bacteria, opc-20011 also showed antibacterial activities similar to those of ceftazidime. the in vivo activities of opc-20011 were comparable to or greater than those of reference compounds in murine models of systemic infection caused by gram-positive and -negative pathogens. opc-20011 was up to 10 times as effective as vancomycin against mrsa infections in mice. this better in vivo efficacy is probably due to the bactericidal activity of opc-20011, while vancomycin showed bacteriostatic activity against mrsa. opc-20011 produced a significant decrease of viable counts in lung tissue at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg of body weight, an efficacy similar to that of ampicillin at a dose of 10 to 20 mg/kg on an experimental murine model of respiratory tract infection caused by non-ampicillin-susceptible s. pneumoniae t-0005. the better therapeutic efficacy  of opc-20011 was considered to be due to its potent antibacterial activity and low affinity for serum proteins of experimental animals (29% in mice and 6.4% in  rats).

(cncm i-841) isolated from a commercial probiotic product was shown to be antagonistic towards several food-borne pathogens including clostridium sp. and listeria monocytogenes. this strain produced and excreted an antibacterial substance in mrs broth. the inhibitory substance was different from hydrogen peroxide, since it was unaffected by catalase. it was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes, indicating that the active moiety of the inhibitor was proteinaceous in nature, and it had no effect on its  producer strain. these properties suggested that the inhibitory substance could be considered as a bacteriocin-like substance. the antimicrobial substance was also produced in m17 and tryptose broths if they were supplemented with tween-80. partial purification allowed a 10.5-fold increase in the specific activity. a preliminary characterization showed that it was active against lactobacilli, enterococcus faecalis, clostridium sp. and listeria sp. it was not affected by 2-h treatment at 60 degrees c, but was sensitive to treatments at 100 degrees c and to autoclaving at 121 degrees c. the activity was not affected by treatments  at ph values ranging from 2 to 11.

TI  == bacteriological activity of trovafloxacin, a new quinolone, against respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  == the use of established fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, as  empirical therapy for the treatment of moderate-to-severe respiratory tract infections is limited by their poor activity against gram-positive and atypical pathogens. data from in vitro susceptibility studies and in vivo animal protection models suggest that the new fluoroquinolone, trovafloxacin, compared with ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin offers equivalent activity against gram-negative pathogens and improved activity against gram-positive pathogens. in particular, susceptibility data indicate that trovafloxacin is at least 16-fold more potent than either ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against penicillin-susceptible and penicillin-resistant strains of streptococcus pneumoniae. other susceptible pathogens include streptococcus pyogenes, vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis and the atypical respiratory pathogens legionella pneumophila, mycoplasma pneumoniae and chlamydia pneumoniae. in vivo studies involving models  of protection against acute systemic infection and pneumococcal pneumonia in mice, and legionnaires' disease in guinea pigs, indicate that the antibacterial spectrum observed for trovafloxacin in vitro extends to the in vivo setting. together, these findings suggest that trovafloxacin may offer clinical efficacy against respiratory pathogens superior to that of ciprofloxacin and of ofloxacin, and may find a useful role as empiric therapy in both the community and hospital  setting.

TI  == blue/white screening of recombinant plasmids in gram-positive bacteria by interruption of alkaline phosphatase gene (phoz) expression.
AB  == the process of screening bacterial transformants for recombinant plasmids is made more rapid and simple by the use of vectors with visually detectable reporter genes. in such systems, an alteration in colony phenotype occurs when a vector-borne indicator gene is interrupted with exogenous dna. although the lacz  system has been used extensively for this purpose in e. coli, analogous systems for use in gram-positive bacteria remain uncommon. we have developed a gram-positive cloning vector that utilizes the interruption of an alkaline phosphatase gene, phoz, to identify recombinant plasmids. to facilitate introduction of foreign dna, a multiple cloning site (mcs) was inserted distal to the region coding for the putative signal peptide of phoz. alkaline phosphatase expressed from the derivative phoz gene (phozmcs) retained activity similar to that of the native protein. the phozmcs was transferred to pjs3, a well-characterized, high-copy number, and broad-host-range plasmid, to produce pdc123. in pdc123, phozmcs was transcriptionally linked to the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (cat) gene under the control of the constitutively expressed tetm and cat promoters that drive cat expression in pjs3. s. agalactiae (group b  streptococci, gbs), e. faecalis, s. pyogenes, s. gordonii, and e. coli containing pdc123 displayed a blue colonial phenotype on agar containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (x-p), which was readily distinguished from  that of colonies containing the parent plasmid pjs3. introduction of foreign dna  into the mcs of phozmcs produced a white colonial phenotype in e. coli and gbs on agar containing x-p and allowed discrimination between transformants containing recombinant plasmids versus those maintaining self-annealed or uncut vector. we have used pdc123 to subclone the cpse gene from the plasmid pcer111, which carries a 9.0-kb fragment of the gbs capsular polysaccharide synthesis locus. the plasmid pdc123 containing cpse was isolated by direct electroporation into gbs strain a909 with selection of transformants containing recombinant plasmids achieved by 'blue/white' screening, without the use of an intermediate host. this new cloning vector should improve the efficiency of performing recombinant dna experiments in gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == binding properties of streptococcus gordonii sspa and sspb (antigen i/ii family)  polypeptides expressed on the cell surface of lactococcus lactis mg1363.
AB  == the oral bacterium streptococcus gordonii expresses two cell wall-associated polypeptides, designated sspa (1,542 amino acid residues) and sspb (1,462 amino acid residues), that have 70% sequence identity. these polypeptides are members of the antigen i/ii family of oral streptococcal adhesins and mediate the binding of streptococci to salivary glycoproteins, collagen, and other oral microorganisms such as actinomyces naeslundii. to determine if sspa and sspb have differential binding properties, the coding sequences of the sspa and sspb genes  were cloned into expression plasmid vector ptrex1-usp45ls to generate ptrex1-sspa and ptrex1-sspb, respectively, and the ssp polypeptides were displayed on the cell surface of lactococcus lactis mg1363. lactococcal cells expressing similar levels of surface sspa or sspb polypeptide were then compared for their abilities to adhere to a range of antigen i/ii polypeptide substrates. more than twice as many l. lactis cells expressing sspa bound to immobilized salivary agglutinin glycoprotein (sag) as did l. lactis cells expressing sspb. in contrast, lactococci expressing sspb adhered twice as well as lactococci producing sspa to  collagen type i and to candida albicans. the binding of a. naeslundii to lactococci was only weakly enhanced by surface expression of ssp polypeptides. l. lactis(ptrex1-sspb) cells bound in greater numbers to sag than did enterococcus faecalis jh2-2 cells expressing sspb from pam401eb-5. the results suggest that sspa and sspb have markedly different binding affinities for their oral substrates and thus may function to promote site diversity in colonization by s.  gordonii.

AB  == we characterized the regulated activity of the lactococcal nisa promoter in strains of the gram-positive species streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, and bacillus subtilis. nisa promoter activity was dependent on the proteins nisr and nisk, which constitute a two-component signal transduction system that responds to the  extracellular inducer nisin. the nisin sensitivity and inducer concentration required for maximal induction varied among the strains. significant induction of the nisa promoter (10- to 60-fold induction) was obtained in all of the species studied at a nisin concentration just below the concentration at which growth is  inhibited. the efficiency of the nisa promoter was compared to the efficiencies of the spac, xyla, and laca promoters in b. subtilis and in s. pyogenes. because  nisa promoter-driven expression is regulated in many gram-positive bacteria, we expect it to be useful for genetic studies, especially studies with pathogenic streptococci in which no other regulated promoters have been described.

AB  == in 1996, the centers for disease control and prevention recommended the use of a  selective broth culture for the improved detection of genital tract or anorectal  carriage of group b streptococci (gbs) in pregnant women. in order to verify this recommendation in our laboratory, we compared the sensitivity of todd-hewitt medium with gentamicin and nalidixic acid (sbm) with our current method of direct plating on blood agar medium containing neomycin and nalidixic acid (nna). five hundred consecutive cervicovaginal and anorectal specimens submitted for gbs culture were included in the study. swabs were plated onto nna and the swabs were immersed in sbm, followed by overnight incubation at 35 degrees c. on the following day, the nna plates were examined for colonies typical of gbs and the organisms were identified by the camp test or by latex agglutination. sbm cultures were subcultured onto blood agar and cna agar plates, and the plates were reincubated for 24 h. negative specimens from either medium were incubated for an additional 24 h and were examined again before finalization of the results. gbs were recovered from 78 specimens by both methods; from sbm only for  17 specimens (sensitivity, 86%) and from nna only for 16 specimens (sensitivity,  85%). a moderate to heavy growth of enterococcus faecalis was observed on plates  containing nna-positive, sbm-negative specimens. competitive growth studies suggested that e. faecalis suppressed the growth potential of gbs in sbm. our study suggests that direct plating on nna, as a single method, is equivalent in sensitivity to sbm for the recovery of gbs, and the results are often available 24 h sooner. however, it appears that both direct plating and selective broth amplification techniques are required for the maximum level of identification of  colonization with gbs in pregnant women.

TI  == urinary excretion and bactericidal activities of a single oral dose of 400 milligrams of fleroxacin versus a single oral dose of 800 milligrams of pefloxacin in healthy volunteers.
AB  == twelve healthy volunteers participated in this randomized crossover study to compare the concentrations and recovery levels of fleroxacin and pefloxacin in urine and to assess their bactericidal activities against 12 strains of urinary pathogens with different susceptibilities over a wide range of mics. the volunteers received a single oral dose of 400 mg of fleroxacin or 800 mg of pefloxacin. the mean cumulative renal excretion of unchanged fleroxacin, n-demethyl-fleroxacin, and n-oxide-fleroxacin accounted for 67, 7, and 6% of the  total dose, respectively. the total urinary recovery of pefloxacin and the active metabolite norfloxacin was 34%. in the time-kill and the urinary bactericidal titer (ubt) studies, only the subjects' urine not supplemented with broth was used. with most tested organisms and both quinolones it took more than 8 h to achieve a reduction in cfu of 99.9% (3 log units). overall, there was a good correlation between ubts and mics for the strains. against escherichia coli atcc  25922 the median ubts were similar for both antibiotics and at least 1:8 for 96 h; against the e. coli strain for which the mic was 0.5 microgram/ml the ubt was  at least 1:4 for 48 h. the ubts of both drugs against klebsiella pneumoniae were  at least 1:16 for 72 h. the ubts for staphylococcus aureus (the mic for which was 16 micrograms/ml) of both antibiotics were low, and in some of the samples, no bactericidal titers were observed. ubts for proteus mirabilis of pefloxacin are significantly higher than those of fleroxacin. for pseudomonas aeruginosa the median ubts were present for the 24-to-48-h interval. the same is true for enterococcus faecalis. against staphylococcus saprophyticus, ubts were present for at least 48 h with both quinolones. overall, a single oral dose of 400 mg of  fleroxacin exhibits ubts comparable to those of 800 mg of pefloxacin. therefore,  it may be expected that half of the dose of fleroxacin gives comparable results in the treatment of urinary tract infections; this should be substantiated in comparative clinical trials.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of quinupristin-dalfopristin (rp 59500, synercid) tested against over 28,000 recent clinical isolates from 200 medical centers in the united states and canada.
AB  == a total of 200 medical center laboratories in the usa and canada contributed results of testing quinupristin-dalfopristin, a streptogramin combination (formerly rp 59500 or synercid), against 28,029 gram-positive cocci. standardized tests [disk diffusion, broth microdilution, etest (ab biodisk, solna, sweden)] were utilized and validated by concurrent quality control tests. remarkable agreement was obtained between test method results for characterizing the collection by the important emerging resistances: 1) oxacillin resistance among staphylococcus aureus (41.0 to 43.7%); 2) vancomycin resistance among enterococcus faecium (50.0 to 52.0%); and 3) the penicillin nonsusceptible rate for pneumococci (31.1% overall, with 10.6% at mics of > or = 2 micrograms/ml). the quinupristin-dalfopristin mic90 for oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant s. aureus was 0.5 microgram/ml and 1 microgram/ml, respectively. the quinupristin-dalfopristin mic90 for vancomycin-resistant e. faecium was 1 microgram/ml, and only 0.2% of isolates were resistant. other enterococcus species were generally not susceptible to the streptogramin combination but were  usually inhibited by ampicillin (86 to 97% susceptible; mic50, 1.0 microgram/ml)  or vancomycin (86 to 95%; mic50, 1.0 microgram/ml). among all tested enterococci, the rate of vancomycin resistance was 16.2%. the quinupristin-dalfopristin mic90  (0.75 microgram/ml) for 4,626 tested streptococcus pneumoniae strains was not influenced by the penicillin or macrolide susceptibility patterns. when five regions in the usa and canada were analyzed for significant streptogramin and other antimicrobial spectrum differences, only the farwest region had lower numbers of streptogramin-susceptible e. faecium. canadian strains were generally  more susceptible to all drugs except chloramphenicol and doxycycline when tested  against e. faecalis (73% and 89% susceptible, respectively). the u.s. southeast region had s. pneumoniae strains less susceptible to macrolides (73%) but had more susceptibility among e. faecium isolates tested against vancomycin and ampicillin. the northeast region of the usa had the greatest rate of vancomycin resistance among enterococci. strains retested by the monitor because of quinupristin-dalfopristin resistance (mics, > or = 4 micrograms/ml) were generally not confirmed (2.2% validation), and only 0.2% of e. faecium isolates were identified as truly resistant. the most common errors were: 1) species misidentification (28.0%); 2) incorrect susceptibility results (65.6%); and 3) mixed cultures (4.3%) tested by participants. overall, quinupristin-dalfopristin  was consistently active (> or = 90% susceptible) against major gram-positive pathogens in north america, regardless of resistance patterns to other drug classes and geographic location of their isolation.

TI  == a new ketolide, hmr 3004, active against streptococci inducibly resistant to erythromycin.
AB  == hmr 3004 is a new hydrazono ketolide characterized by a 3-keto function instead of the cladinose moiety. the effect of this antimicrobial agent on inducible and  constitutive macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin b (mlsb) resistance was tested in a lacz reporter system under control of several ermam-like attenuator variants. for one constitutively resistant streptococcus agalactiae strain, three inducibly resistant streptococcus pneumoniae strains, and one inducibly resistant enterococcus faecalis strain, the attenuators fused with lacz were cloned into the shuttle plasmid pjim2246 and the plasmid was introduced into staphylococcus aureus rn4220. for the wild-type attenuators, hmr 3004 was a very weak inducer, unlike its cladinose counterpart ru 6652 and erythromycin. as expected, for the fusion originating from the constitutively resistant s. agalactiae strain, the level of uninduced beta-galactosidase synthesis was high. for one s. pneumoniae attenuator, mutations in the 3' end of the attenuator that weakened the stem-loop structure that sequesters the ribosome-binding site and start codon for ermam methylase could explain the high level of uninduced beta-galactosidase produced.  for streptococci, the activity of hmr 3004 correlated with the basal level of beta-galactosidase synthesized. the weak inducer activity of hmr 3004 explained its activity against inducibly mlsb-resistant s. pneumoniae but did not correlate with the moderate activity of the antibiotic against inducibly resistant e. faecalis.

TI  == characterization of the haemolytic activity of streptococcus equi.
AB  == the haemolytic activity of streptococcus equi, the cause of equine strangles, was characterized. production of haemolysin in todd hewitt broth was dependent on an  equine serum supplement and the logarithmic phase of growth after which activity  declined sharply. rna core also induced haemolysin production from cells harvested at the end of the logarithmic phase of growth. haemolysis was not affected by cholesterol, was only slightly increased in reducing conditions and was completely inactivated by trypan blue, identifying the haemolytic activity as streptolysin s-like (sls-like). purification by hydroxyapatite and sephacryl column chromatography yielded proteins of molecular weights of approximately 6000 and 17 000-22 000 da with a 64-fold increase in specific activity. low molecular  weight proteins from the rna core were still present in the purified toxin. two non-haemolytic mutants were derived by conjugation with an enterococcus faecalis-carrying transposon tn916. southern blots of hindiii digests of dna revealed that one of the mutants contained three transposon insertions and the other just one. a lambda phage library of s. equi contained plaques whose haemolytic activity was enhanced by reducing conditions and inhibited by cholesterol, suggesting a streptolysin o-like (slo-like) activity. however, haemolysin in culture sonicates of host e. coli in which the lambda phage insert  was subcloned into plasmid (puc18), was not affected by these conditions. seven isolates of s. equi in medium without sls-like inducers showed no slo-like activity and no evidence for an slo-like toxin could be found by immunoblotting with pneumolysin antiserum and monoclonal antibodies or by polymerase chain reaction with primers derived from sequences conserved between the slo genes of lancefield group a, c and g streptococci. s. equi does not appear to possess a streptolysin o but does make a streptolysin s-like toxin whose production can be  interrupted at just one genetic locus.

AB  == the in vitro activity of trovafloxacin against 721 gram-negative and 498 gram-positive organisms was determined by the standard microdilution broth method using commercially prepared frozen microtiter plates. the activity of trovafloxacin was compared to ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin/clavulanate,  ampicillin/sulbactam (1:1), piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftriaxone, and imipenem. trovafloxacin had equal or greater activity compared with the other agents tested against citrobacter diversus, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, serratia  marcescens, staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus viridans, group g streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, and e. faecium. the reliability of the commercially prepared plates for testing the in vitro activity of the quinolones was evaluated by comparing identical isolates also tested by broth microdilution using laboratory prepared plates. the commercially prepared plates generally correlated, within one- to twofold dilutions, with the laboratory prepared plates. there was, however, a large discrepancy obtained when testing enterobacter agglomerans and e. cloacae, where  the commercially prepared plates yielded a significantly higher mic90 value.

TI  == antibacterial efficacy of nisin against multidrug-resistant gram-positive pathogens.
AB  == the rapid spread of multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens necessitates the search for alternative antibacterial agents. we examined the efficacy of the antibiotic nisin against 56 multidrug-resistant isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae, 33 staphylococcus aureus and 29 vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis isolates. the test strains represented a large  variety of clonal types (as determined by a combination of dna fingerprints) isolated from a variety of geographic sources, and included some of the major internationally-spread multiresistant epidemic clones of s. pneumoniae and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), mrsa strains resistant to over 16 generically distinct antibacterial agents, and enterococcal strains resistant to  all currently available chemotherapeutic agents including glycopeptides. in the overwhelming majority of cases, treatment of growing cultures with nisin at 1 mg/l (s. pneumoniae) or 10-20 mg/l (in mrsa and enterococci) caused extensive (10(3)- to 10(4)-fold) loss of viable titre accompanied by various degrees of loss in the optical density of the cultures, which was most extensive in pneumococci (>90%) and least extensive (40-50%) in enterococci. nevertheless, extensive variation in rates of nisin-induced autolysis was observed in each bacterial species. serial exposure of a penicillin-susceptible strain of s. pneumoniae to nisin (1 mg/l) in liquid culture resulted in the rapid appearance of stable nisin-resistant mutants in which the mic increased from 0.4 to 6.4 mg/l and the resistance trait was transferable by genetic transformation.

AB  == streptolysin s (sls) is a potent cytolytic toxin produced by nearly all group a streptococci (gas). sls-deficient tn916 insertional mutants were generated from two clinical isolates of gas, mgas166s and t18ps (m serotypes 1 and 18, respectively), by transposon mutagenesis using tn916 donor strain enterococcus faecalis cg110. representative nonhemolytic transconjugants sbnh5 and sb30-2 each harbored a single tn916 insertion in identical loci. the insertion in sbnh5 was located in the promoter region of an open reading frame, designated saga, rendering it transcriptionally inactive. protease, streptolysin o, and dnase activities and the production of m protein remained the same in the nonhemolytic  mutants and the wild-type strains, as did the growth rates and exoprotein profiles. transconjugants were evaluated in an established murine model by injecting the organisms subcutaneously and monitoring the mice for alterations in weight and the development of necrotic lesions. animals infected with sbnh5, compared to those infected with mgas166s, gained weight during the first 24 h (+1.15 versus -1.16 g; p < 0.05) and had fewer necrotic lesions (0 versus 7; p =  0.0007). animals infected with sb30-2, compared to those infected with t18ps, also gained weight within the first 24 h (+0.54 versus -0.66 g; p < 0.05) and produced fewer necrotic lesions (1 versus 8; p = 0.001). revertants of the mutants in which tn916 had been excised regained the hemolytic phenotype and the  virulence profile of the wild-type strains. this study demonstrates that sls-deficient mutants of gas, belonging to different m serotypes and containing identical tn916 mutations, are markedly less virulent than their isogenic parents.

TI  == immunoreactivity of five monoclonal antibodies against the 37-kilodalton common cell wall protein (psaa) of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == five monoclonal antibodies (mabs) were produced against the streptococcus pneumoniae pneumococcal surface adhesin a (psaa) 37-kda common cell wall protein. these antibodies were used in a dot immunoblot and western blot study of clinical isolates of s. pneumoniae to detect the presence of the protein. by both assays,  the mabs reacted with clinical isolates representing the 23 type-specific serotypes present in the licensed pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. western blot analysis confirmed the presence of a protein migrating in the gel with a molecular mass of 37 kda. an extension of the study by using dot immunoblot analysis that included an analysis of the 90 serotypes of s. pneumoniae showed that all five mabs reacted with 89 of the 90 serotypes tested. mab 1b6, the exception, did not react with s. pneumoniae serotype 16f. dot immunoblot analysis of the mabs with enterococcus faecalis and viridans streptococci showed varied reactivity patterns, depending on the species. the mabs against the 37-kda antigen did not react with escherichia coli, respiratory pathogens, or nonpathogens representing 22 genera and 29 species of bacteria. all five mabs also reacted with five multidrug-resistant strains of s. pneumoniae. in summary,  these mabs may be useful for detection of pneumococcal antigen and may lead to the development of diagnostic assays for pneumococcal disease.

TI  == import and metabolism of glutathione by streptococcus mutans.
AB  == glutathione (gamma-glucysgly, gsh) is not found in most gram-positive bacteria, but some appear to synthesize it and others, including streptococcus mutans atcc  33402, import it from their growth medium. import of oxidized glutathione (gssg)  by s. mutans 33402 in 7h9 medium was shown to require glucose and to occur with an apparent km of 18+/-5 microm. gssg, gsh, s-methylglutathione, and homocysteine-glutathione mixed disulfide (hcyssg) were imported at comparable rates (measured by depletion of substrate in the medium), as was the disulfide of gamma-glucys. in contrast, the disulfide of cysgly was not taken up at a measurable rate, indicating that the gamma-glu residue is important for efficient transport. during incubation with gssg, little gssg was detected in cells but gsh and gamma-glucys accumulated during the first 30 min and then declined. no significant intracellular accumulation of cys or sulfide was found. transient intracellular accumulation of d/l-homocysteine, as well as gsh and gamma-glucys,  was observed during import of hcyssg. although substantial levels of gsh were found in cells when s. mutans was grown on media containing glutathione, such gsh accumulation had no effect on the growth rate. however, the presence of cellular  gsh did protect against growth inhibition by the thiol-oxidizing agent diamide. import of glutathione by s. mutans atcc 25175, which like strain 33402 does not synthesize glutathione, occurred at a rate comparable to that of strain 33402, but three species which appear to synthesize glutathione (s. agalactiae atcc 12927, s. pyogenes atcc 8668, and enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212) imported glutathione at negligible or markedly lower rates.

TI  == discovery of novel pyridinopolyamines with potent antimicrobial activity: deconvolution of mixtures synthesized by solution-phase combinatorial chemistry.
AB  == a 1638-member pyridinopolyamine library, consisting of 13 sublibraries of 126 members prepared by a solution-phase approach, was completely deconvoluted from orthogonally protected intermediates by a combination of iterative and positional scanning procedures. antibacterial assays against streptococcus pyogenes and escherichia coli imp- and a candida albicans yeast specificity assay were employed to follow the activity of sublibraries. screening of the 13 sublibraries, which were prepared by a synthetic method that places the differentiating functionality in a selected position a (secondary amine), at the  end of the synthesis (fix last), provided several first-round activities. subsequently, six single pyridinopolyamines (2-7) were prepared where the first-round winner, a hydrogen atom, is in the first deconvoluted position and the remaining three positions contained the same functionalities. the range of antibacterial and yeast activities of these single compounds suggested that a more active and selective compound may be discovered by completely deconvoluting  the first-round active sublibraries. pyridinopolyamine positions b (secondary benzylamine) and c (primary benzylamine) were then sequentially positionally scanned with a set of six meta-substituted benzyl functionalities to generate two sets of second/third-round sublibraries, containing 21 or 36 compounds in each sublibrary, respectively. high-throughput screening yielded sublibraries 15, 18,  and 21 with mics of 1-5 microm against s. pyogenes and e. coli imp-. using rounds 1 and 2/3 screening data, two sets of single compounds (22-27) and (28-32) with the combination of m-(trifluoromethyl)-benzyl group at position c and m-(trifluoromethyl)benzyl or m-methylbenzyl group at position b with position d (primary benzylamine) fixed were synthesized in the fourth round deconvolution. subsequently, broader screening of deconvoluted compounds against a tier ii panel of wild-type bacteria identified eight compounds (5, 7, 27, and 29-32) with approximately 100-fold greater selectivity for gram-positive than gram-negative bacteria. thus, s. pyogenes, s. pyogenes (wild-type), streptomyces aureus, and enterococcus faecalis were inhibited at mics of 1-12 microm, whereas mics for e.  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were >  100 microm. these eight compounds were not active (> 100 microm) against fungus c. albicans.

TI  == a broad-host-range mobilizable shuttle vector for the construction of transcriptional fusions to beta-galactosidase in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == a low-copy-number vector designated ptcv-lac has been constructed to provide a convenient system to analyze regulatory elements in gram-positive bacteria. the main components of this vector are: (i) the origins of replication of pacyc184 and of the broad-host-range enterococcal plasmid pam beta 1, (ii) erythromycin- and kanamycin-resistance-encoding genes for selection in gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, (iii) the transfer origin of the incp plasmid rk2, and (iv) a promoterless beta-galactosidase-encoding lacz gene with a gram-positive ribosome binding site. this 12 kb plasmid is present in gram-positive hosts in three to five copies per chromosome equivalent and contains three unique cloning  sites (ecori, smai, bamhi) for cloning of dna inserts upstream of the lacz gene.  plasmid ptcv-lac and derivatives carrying different promoter fragments have been  transferred by conjugation from an escherichia coli incp mobilizing donor strain  to bacillus subtilis, listeria monocytogenes, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus agalactiae. these plasmids were structurally stable in these hosts  and the corresponding promoter activities, quantitated by the determination of the beta-galactosidase specific activities, were found to cover at least a 100-fold range in beta-galactosidase values. these results indicate that ptcv-lac should be useful for analysis of gene regulation in a wide range of gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == clinical and microbiological features of refractory periodontitis subjects.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to compare the clinical parameters and the  site prevalence and levels of 40 subgingival species in successfully treated and  refractory periodontitis subjects. 94 subjects received scaling and root planing  and if needed, periodontal surgery and systemically administered tetracycline. 28 refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or > 3 sites showing attachment loss > 2.5 mm within 1 year post-therapy. 66 successfully treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss > 2.5 mm. baseline subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth and the presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the mean levels and % of sites colonized by each species (prevalence) was computed for each subject and differences between groups sought using the mann-whitney test. most of the 40 species tested, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus, were equally or less prevalent in the refractory group. prevotella nigrescens was significantly more prevalent in successfully treated subjects, while refractory subjects harbored a larger proportion of streptococcus species, particularly streptococcus constellatus. the odds of a subject being refractory was 8.6 (p < 0.001) if s. constellatus constituted > or = 3.5% of the  total dna probe count. since few microbiological differences existed between treatment outcome groups using dna probes to known species, the predominant cultivable microbiota of 33 subgingival samples from 14 refractory subjects was examined. 85% of the 1649 isolates were identified using probes to 69 recognized  subgingival species. the remaining unidentified strains were classified by analyzing 16s rrna gene sequences. many sequenced isolates were of taxa not considered a common part of the oral microbiota such as acinetobacter baumanni, gemella haemolysans, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus warneri, pseudomonas aeruginosa and novel species in the genera bartonella, ralstonia, neisseria, eubacterium, rothia, gordona, gemella, corynebacterium, leptotrichia, and actinomyces. refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based on their subgingival microbiota. as a group, they did not harbor more of the "classic" periodontopathogens, although elevated proportions of s. constellatus were found.

TI  == acid tolerance response and survival by oral bacteria.
AB  == using 21 species of oral bacteria, representing six acidogenic genera, we undertook to determine whether the ph-limiting exponential growth is related to the ability of the organisms to generate an acid-tolerance response that results  in enhanced survival at low ph. the lower ph limit of exponential growth varied by more than two units with that of neisseria a182 at ph 6.34; growth of lactobacillus casei rb1014 stopped at ph 3.81, with species of actinomyces, enterococcus, prevotella and streptococcus falling between these limits. the working hypothesis was that the organisms with the higher ph limits for growth are unable to respond to acidic environments in order to survive, whereas the more aciduric organisms would possess or acquire acid tolerance. adaptation to acid tolerance was tested by determining whether the prior exposure of exponential-phase cells to a low, sub-lethal ph would trigger the induction of a  mechanism that would enhance survival at a ph killing ph 7.5 control cells. the killing ph varied from ph 4.5 for prevotella intermedia atcc 25611 to ph 2.3 for  the three lactobacillus casei strains in the study, with the three streptococcus  mutans strains killed at ph 3.0 for 3 h. the adaptation experiments revealed three groups of organisms: non-acid-responders, generally representing strains with the highest terminal ph values; weak acid-responders in the middle of the ph list, generating low numbers of survivors at one or two ph values, and the aciduric, strong responders generating a high number of survivors at ph values in the range 6.0 to 3.5, but not at ph 7.5. predominant among the latter group were  the s. mutans and lactobacilli casei strains, with the most significant adaptive  response exhibited by s. mutans lt11 and s. mutans ingbritt, involving a process  that required protein synthesis. time course experiments with the latter organisms indicated that 90-120 min was required after exposure to the triggering ph before the acid response was fully functional. these results indicate that the sudden exposure of strains of oral streptococci and lactobacilli, as well as enterococcus faecalis, to ph values between 6.0 and 3.5 results in the induction  of an acid tolerance response that enhances the survival of these strains at or below ph 3.5.

TI  == repetitive sequence-based pcr versus pulsed-field gel electrophoresis for typing  of enterococcus faecalis at the subspecies level.
AB  == repetitive sequence-based pcr was compared to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) for the ability to discriminate enterococcus faecalis isolates at the subspecies level. the boxa2r primer, derived from repetitive sequences in streptococcus pneumoniae, was applied to 41 isolates of e. faecalis collected from various sources. the rep1r-dt and rep2-dt primers, derived from the gram-negative repetitive extragenic palindromic element, were also applied to 18  selected isolates. of the 41 isolates examined, 7 were beta-lactamase producing and 8 were vancomycin resistant. by pfge, 17 isolates had distinct patterns; the  other 24 were classified into eight different clonal groups. by pcr using the boxa2r primer, 16 isolates generated distinct patterns; the other 25 were classified into nine different clonal groups. there were only minor differences in the pcr results obtained by using the boxa2r primer and the rep1r-dt and rep2-dt primers. two isolates among vancomycin-resistant enterococci from the greater houston, tex., area were related by pfge, distinct by pcr with the boxa2r primer, and related by pcr with the rep1r-dt and rep2-dt primers. clonal relationships among the remaining 39 isolates were similar by both pfge and pcr.  pcr reliably discriminated all epidemiologically unrelated isolates. although pcr is less time consuming than pfge, pcr results were more difficult to interpret than pfge results, perhaps because fewer bands were generated by pcr than by pfge and some pcr products were inconsistently seen.

TI  == molecular mechanism of peptide-specific pheromone signaling in enterococcus faecalis: functions of pheromone receptor traa and pheromone-binding protein trac encoded by plasmid ppd1.
AB  == conjugative transfer of the enterococcus faecalis plasmid ppd1 is activated by cpd1, one of several peptide sex pheromones secreted by plasmid-free recipient cells, and is blocked by a donor-produced peptide inhibitor, ipd1. using a tritiated pheromone, [3h]cpd1, we investigated how ppd1-harboring donor cells receive these peptide signals. donor cells rapidly incorporated [3h]cpd1. the cell extract but not the membrane fraction of the donor strain exhibited significant [3h]cpd1-binding activity. on the basis of these data and those of tracer studies, it was demonstrated that cpd1 was internalized, where it bound to a high-molecular-weight compound. the cell extract of a strain carrying the traa-bearing multicopy plasmid (pdlhh21) also exhibited high [3h]cpd1-binding activity. a recombinant traa exhibited a dissociation constant of 0.49 +/- 0.08 nm against [3h]cpd1. ipd1 competitively inhibited [3h]cpd1 binding to traa, whereas pheromones and inhibitors relating to other plasmid systems did not. these results show that traa is a specific intracellular receptor for cpd1 and that ipd1 acts as an antagonist for traa. a strain carrying the trac-bearing multicopy plasmid (pdles23) exhibited significant [3h]cpd1-binding activity. a strain carrying trac-disrupted ppd1 (pam351cm) exhibited lower [3h] cpd1-binding  activity as well as lower sensitivity to cpd1 than a wild-type donor strain. some of the other pheromones and inhibitors inhibited [3h]cpd1 binding to the trac transformant like cpd1 and ipd1 did. these results show that trac, as an extracellular less-specific pheromone-binding protein, supports donor cells to receive cpd1.

TI  == [comparative antimicrobial activity of rp 59,500 (quinupristin-dalfopristin), the first semisynthetic injectable streptgramin, against gram-positive cocci and other recent clinical pathogens].
AB  == rp 59,500 (quinupristin-dalfopristin) is the first semisynthetic injectable streptogramin antimicrobial agent, which is a combination of quinupristin and dalfopristin in a 30:70 ratio. the components of rp 59,500 act synergically to provide bactericidal activity through action at different sites on bacterial ribosomes. in the present study, the antimicrobial activity of rp 59,500 was compared with those of four macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, roxithromycin). susceptibility testing was carried out by microdilution method on 303 strains of 10 species, especially antibiotic-resistant gram-positive cocci. rp 59,500 was active against a wide range of gram-positive cocci including methicillin-resistant staphylococci and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the mics90 of rp 59,500 against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and staphylococcus epidermidis were both 0.25 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. the mics90 of rp 59,500 against penicillin-sensitive, -intermediate and -resistant s. pneumoniae were all 0.5 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. rp 59,500 also exhibited equivalent activities to the four macrolides against strains of streptococcus pyogenes. streptococcus agalactiae and moraxella catarrhalis. rp 59,500 exhibited the highest activities against enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus avium strains which  are intrinsically resistant to most antimicrobial agents. no cross-resistance was observed between rp 59,500 and the four macrolides, which will merit attention in future clinical trials of the agent. the effect of human serum on the mic of rp 59,500 was studied with strains of s. aureus, s. epidermidis and e. faecalis. the presence of 20% (v/v) serum had little or no effect on the mic, although 50% (v/v) serum increased mics by 4-8 folds. laboratory-induced resistance to rp 59,500 occurred in a stepwise fashion in broth cultures of s. aureus, s. epidermidis and e. facalis strains and the induction rate was slow and no more than four fold increases were observed. population analysis was performed on rp 59,500 and the reference macrolides against s. aureus atcc 25,923 strain. although low frequencies (less than 0.01%) of resistant sub-population were detected with em, cam, azm and rxm, no rp 59,500-resistant sub-population was detected in this study.

TI  == [meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  == meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position c1  which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (dhp-1),  thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in c2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the pbps. it covers gram positive aerobes (staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, enterococcus faecalis, rhodococcus equi, listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, aeromonas, plesiomonas, vibrio, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria, moraxella) and anaerobes  (bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, clostridium, peptostreptococcus, and propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: p. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and h. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci,  streptococci and staphylococci). meropenem has no activity on enterococcus faecium, s. aureus resistant to methycillin, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the oprd porin (oprd2 in enterobacteria and p. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the pbps (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).

TI  == cloning and genetic and sequence analyses of the bacteriocin 21 determinant encoded on the enterococcus faecalis pheromone-responsive conjugative plasmid ppd1.
AB  == the pheromone-responsive conjugative plasmid ppd1 (59 kb) of enterococcus faecalis encodes the bacteriocin 21 (bac21) determinant. cloning, transposon insertion mutagenesis and sequence analysis of the bac21 determinant showed that  an 8.5-kb fragment lying between kb 27.1 and 35.6 of the ppd1 map is required for complete expression of the bacteriocin. the 8.5-kb fragment contained nine open reading frames (orfs), baca to bac1, which were oriented in the same (upstream-to-downstream) direction. transposon insertions into the baca to bace orfs, which are located in the proximal half of bac21, resulted in defective bacteriocin expression. insertions into the bacf to bac1 orfs, which are located  in the distal half of bac21, resulted in reduced bacteriocin expression. deletion mutant analysis of the cloned 8.5-kb fragment revealed that the deletion of segments between kb 31.6 and 35.6 of the ppd1 map, which contained the distal region of the determinant encoding bacf to bac1, resulted in reduced bacteriocin  expression. the smallest fragment (4.5 kb) retaining some degree of bacteriocin expression contained the baca to bace sequences located in the proximal half of the determinant. the cloned fragment encoding the 4.5-kb proximal region and a tn916 insertion mutant into ppd1 bacb trans-complemented intracellularly to give  complete expression of the bacteriocin. baca encoded a 105-residue sequence with  a molecular mass of 11.1 kda. the deduced baca protein showed 100% homology to the broad-spectrum antibiotic peptide as-48, which is encoded on the e. faecalis  conjugative plasmid pmb2 (58 kb). bach encoded a 195-residue sequence with a molecular mass of 21.9 kda. the deduced amino acid sequence showed significant homology to the c-terminal region of hlyb (31.1% identical residues), a protein located in the escherichia coli alpha-hemolysin operon that is a representative bacterial atp-binding cassette export protein.

AB  == new pyrrolidine derivatives, which bear an alkyloxime substituent in the 4-position and an aminomethyl substituent in the 3-position of the pyrrolidine ring, have been synthesized and coupled with various quinolinecarboxylic acids to produce a series of new fluoroquinolone antibacterials. these fluoroquinolones were found to possess potent antimicrobial activity against both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, including methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). variations at the c-8 position of the quinolone nucleus included fluorine, chlorine, nitrogen, methoxy, and hydrogen atom substitution. the activity imparted to the substituted quinolone nucleus by the c-8 substituent was in the order f (c5-nh2) > f (c5-h) > naphthyridine > cl = ome = h against gram-positive organisms. in the case of gram-negative strains, activity was in the order f (c5-nh2) > naphthyridine = f (c5-h) > h > cl > ome. the advantages provided by the newly introduced oxime group of the quinolones were clearly demonstrated by their comparison to a desoximino compound 30. in addition, the oxime moiety greatly improved the pharmacokinetic parameters of the novel quinolones. among these compounds, compound 20 (lb20304) showed the best in vivo  efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile in animals, as well as good physical properties. the mics (microgram/ml) of lb20304, compound 30, and ciprofloxacin against several test organisms are as follows: s. aureus 6538p (0.008, 0.031, and 0.13), methicillin resistant s. aureus 241 (4, 16, and 128), streptococcus epidermidis 887e (0.008, 0.016, and 0.13), methicillin resistant s. epidermidis 178 (4, 32, and 128), enterococcus faecalis 29212 (0.063, 0.13, and 1), pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e (0.25, 0.5, and 0.13), escherichia coli 3190y (0.008, 0.016, and 0.008), enterobacter cloacae p99 (0.008, 0.031, and 0.008), actinobacter calcoaceticus 15473 (0.063, 0.13, and 0.25). on the basis of these promising results, lb20304 was selected as a candidate for further evaluation.

AB  == cfc-222 is a novel fluoroquinolone containing a c-7 bicyclic amine moiety with potent antibacterial activities against gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms. we compared the in vitro and in vivo activities of cfc-222 with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and lomefloxacin. cfc-222 was more active than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive bacteria. cfc-222 was particularly active against streptococcus pneumoniae (mic at which 90% of isolates are inhibited [mic90], 0.2 microg/ml), staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.2 microg/ml for ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains), and enterococcus faecalis (mic90, 0.39 microg/ml). against escherichia coli and other members of the family enterobacteriaceae, cfc-222 was slightly less active than ciprofloxacin (mic90s for e. coli, 0.1 and 0.025 microg/ml, respectively). the in vitro activity of cfc-222 was not influenced by inoculum size, medium composition, or the presence  of horse serum. however, its activity was decreased significantly by a change in  the ph of the medium from 7.0 to 6.0, as was the case for the other quinolones tested. the in vivo protective efficacy of cfc-222 by oral administration was greater than those of the other quinolones tested in a mouse model of intraperitoneally inoculated systemic infection caused by s. aureus. cfc-222 exhibited efficacy comparable to that of ciprofloxacin in the same model of infection caused by gram-negative organisms, such as e. coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. in this infection model, cfc-222 was slightly less active than ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. these results suggest that cfc-222  may be a promising therapeutic agent in various bacterial infections.

TI  == successful single-dose teicoplanin prophylaxis against experimental streptococcal, enterococcal, and staphylococcal aortic valve endocarditis.
AB  == teicoplanin is a glycopeptide antibiotic that is administered both intramuscularly and intravenously. it has a prolonged half-life and a less toxic  profile in comparison to those of vancomycin. the efficacy of a single dose of teicoplanin (18 mg/kg of body weight given intramuscularly) for the prevention of endocarditis due to streptococcus oralis, enterococcus faecium, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was evaluated after applying the rabbit model. vancomycin at a single dose of 30 mg/kg given intravenously was used as the comparative agent for the prevention of endocarditis due to mrsa and  e. faecium, while ampicillin at a single dose of 40 mg/kg given intravenously was used as the comparative agent for the prevention of endocarditis due to s. oralis. rabbits in the teicoplanin group were infected at 1 h postdosing with approximately 10(7) cfu of each strain. rabbits in the other groups were infected at 0.5 h postdosing with approximately 10(7) cfu of s. oralis (ampicillin group)  or e. faecium and mrsa (vancomycin group). all rabbits were sacrificed 5 days later. teicoplanin and vancomycin protected the animals challenged with e. faecium by 87.5 and 50%, respectively, and protected the animals challenged with  mrsa by 100 and 92%, respectively. teicoplanin and ampicillin protected the animals challenged with s. oralis by 100 and 77%, respectively. prevention of endocarditis by teicoplanin was likely to be due to a prolonged inhibition of bacterial growth by the sustained supra-mics. it is concluded that teicoplanin is very effective in preventing experimental streptococcal, enterococcal, and staphylococcal endocarditis and may be an attractive alternative antibiotic in patients allergic to beta-lactams, especially in the outpatient setting.

TI  == a computerised system for the identification of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == a generic computerised system for the identification of bacteria was developed. the system is equipped with a key to the identification of lactic acid bacteria.  the identification is carried out in two steps. the first step distinguishes groups of bacteria by following a decision tree with general identification tests. the second step in the identification is the distinction of species within a group on the basis of biochemical fermentation patterns. during grouping, probabilities for test failure are used. these probabilities can be used for assessing the quality of a given test answer. the probabilities are also used to  select the most probable test answer in cases where the test result is inconclusive. the probabilities of test failure were determined by a group of experts and a group of potential users of the identification system. during species identification, similarity indices are calculated for all bacteria in a group. the described identification system has the ability to "learn" from different sessions in the species identification step, improving both identification speed and accuracy. because of the versatile way in which the system is set up, it can very easily be expanded with identification keys to other organisms.

TI  == efficacy and safety of vancomycin constant-rate infusion in the treatment of chronic gram-positive bone and joint infections.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vancomycin constant-rate infusion over 24 h in the treatment of gram-positive bone infections, methods: vancomycin (40 mg/kg/day) was administered without a loading dose to 15 patients  (12 male, three female) aged 23--90 years, weighing 46--85 kg, with postoperative chronic bone and joint infections. the 24-h dose was adjusted to maintain plasma  levels between 25 and 35 mg/l. mean duration of therapy was 6.2 months (4--8.5) via a portable infusion pump. sites of infection included hip and femur (10), tibia (three), patella (one) and vertebrae (one). sequestrectomy (two), removal of material (7/8 prosthetic hips, 1/5 metal implants) and debridement (two) were  performed at the beginning of the treatment. involved bacteria included staphylococcus aureus (eight, six methicillin resistant), s. epidermidis (four methicillin-resistant), enterococcus faecalis (one), enterococcus avium (one) and streptococcus bovis (one). results: mic of vancomycin ranged from 1 to 4 mg/l. the mean vancomycin bone concentration when available was 67.7plus minus38.9 microg/l. based on a mean post-treatment follow-up of 14plus minus4 months (6--20.6), cure was achieved in 10 patients (66.6%). failures were related to the inability to remove the infected prosthesis (one) or implants (three) and to the  persistence of a deep wound abcess (one). adverse events included pruritus (four  cases), tinnitus (two), mild transient elevation of creatinine level (three) and  transient neutropenia (two). vancomycin was maintained in all the patients. conclusions: prolonged treatment with vancomycin constant-rate infusion is effective and safe for treatment of gram-positive chronic bone and joint infections, providing that complete surgical debridement and prosthetic material  removal are performed.

TI  == [survey of sensitivities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents (annual report)].
AB  == research groups were formed in 20 institutions nationwide to investigate carbapenem resistance of clinical isolates. activities of various antibacterial agents, principally carbapenems, were tested against clinical isolates collected  from these institutions. the broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 17 antibacterial agents for 1,326 strains of 11 bacterial species isolated at the institutions between october and  december 1994. the results are as follows: 1. carbapenems exhibited strong antibacterial activities against mssa and streptococcus pneumoniae. their activities against enterococcus faecalis were comparable to that of abpc. carbapenems showed low activities against mrsa. 2. oflx exhibited the greatest antibacterial activity against haemophilus influenzae, followed by mepm. antibacterial activities of the other carbapenems were comparable to those of fmox, ctm, and abpc. 3. the carbapenems showed high activities against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and bacteroides fragilis group. their activities were greater than those exhibited by other beta-lactam antibacterial agents. the carbapenems also exhibited stronger antibacterial activities against serratia marcescens than the other beta-lactam antibacterial agents, but some resistant strains were detected. 4. the antibacterial activities of carbapenems against pseudomonas aeruginosa were comparable to those of caz, azt, amk.

TI  == serum inhibitory titers and serum bactericidal titers for human subjects receiving multiple doses of the antibacterial oxazolidinones eperezolid and linezolid.
AB  == in phase i trials subjects received multiple doses of eperezolid (pnu-100592; formerly u-100592) and linezolid (pnu-100766; formerly u-100766), and steady-state samples were drawn at the projected peak and trough timepoints. serum inhibitory titer and serum bactericidal titer values were determined using  single strains of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae. serum inhibitory titer values generally correlated with drug concentration in serum and inherent organism susceptibility. against s. aureus and e. faecalis sera from patients dosed with either drug were generally inhibitory at the peak timepoint, but at trough only linezolid exhibited a persistent effect. no bactericidal activity was seen for either drug against s. aureus or e. faecalis. the sera from patients dosed with either drug exhibited inhibition of s. pneumoniae at peak and trough. bactericidal activity was seen against s. pneumoniae for both drugs at peak time and at trough for many of the sera for patients on the higher dose regimens. the results demonstrated that the  sera from most human subjects dosed with eperezolid or linezolid were inhibitory  to s. aureus and e. faecalis and s. pneumoniae and that many of the samples exhibited bactericidal activity for s. pneumoniae.

TI  == a review of the in vitro activity of meropenem and comparative antimicrobial agents tested against 30,254 aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated world wide.
AB  == the in vitro activity of meropenem (formerly sm-7738), a new carbapenem, was compared with that of imipenem and five other broad-spectrum antimicrobials (ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin) against 30,254 clinically significant pathogens isolated in nine countries worldwide. overall, the carbapenems, meropenem and imipenem, were the most active drugs. meropenem was four- to 64-fold more active than imipenem against gram-negative bacteria, including the enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. meropenem was also quite active against ceftazidime-resistant strains of enterobacteriaceae, inhibiting 87.5 to 100% at < or = 4 micrograms/ml. in contrast, imipenem was four- to eight-fold more active than meropenem against  gram-positive species, including methicillin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis. among the anaerobes, strains resistant to meropenem or imipenem were encountered very rarely. these extensive data provide additional in vitro support for the clinical use of meropenem as a broad spectrum antimicrobial agent active against key pathogenic species of bacteria.

TI  == development of an antimicrobial susceptibility testing method suitable for performance during space flight.
AB  == very little is known regarding the effects of the microgravity environment of space flight upon the action of antimicrobial agents on bacterial pathogens. this study was undertaken to develop a simple method for conducting antibacterial susceptibility tests during a space shuttle mission. specially prepared susceptibility test research cards (biomerieux vitek, hazelwood, mo.) were designed to include 6 to 11 serial twofold dilutions of 14 antimicrobial agents,  including penicillins, cephalosporins, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, vancomycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. mics of the drugs were determined by visual reading of color end points in the vitek research cards made possible by incorporation of a colorimetric growth indicator (alamarblue; accumed international, westlake, ohio). this study has demonstrated reproducible susceptibility results in the testing of isolates of staphylococcus aureus, group a streptococcus species, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli (beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains), klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in some instances, the mics were comparable to those determined by a standard broth microdilution method, while in some cases the unique test media and format yielded slightly different values that were themselves reproducible. the proposed in-flight experiment will  include inoculation of the vitek cards on the ground prior to launch of the space shuttle, storage of inoculated cards at refrigeration temperature aboard the space shuttle until experiment initiation, and then incubation of the cards for 18 to 48 h prior to visual interpretation of mics by the mission's astronauts. ground-based studies have shown reproducible mics following storage of inoculated cards for 7 days at 4 to 8 degrees c to accommodate the mission's time schedule and the astronaut's activities. for comparison, ground-based control (normal gravity) mic values will be generated by simultaneous inoculation and incubation  of a second set of test cards in a laboratory at the launch site. this procedure  can provide for a safe and compact experiment that should yield new information on the effects of microgravity on the biological activities of various classes of antibiotics.

AB  == rpr 106972 is a novel oral streptogramin combination with reported therapeutic potency against gram-positive and certain respiratory tract pathogens. mics for rpr 106972, quinupristin/dalfopristin, and seven comparison drugs were determined by the reference methods against 337 strains selected to define spectrum and potency. rpr 106972 demonstrated antimicrobial activity against oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus (mic ranges of 0.12 to 2 micrograms/ml and 0.5 to 2 micrograms/ml, respectively), and coagulase-negative staphylococci were also inhibited by rpr 106972 (mic90, < or = 0.5 microgram/ml)  and quinupristin/dalfopristin (mic90, < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). against all streptococcal strains tested (including penicillin-resistant pneumococcus), rpr 106972 was highly active with mic results at < or = 1 microgram/ml. rpr 106972 inhibited corynebacterium jeikeium (mic90, 0.5 microgram/ml). moraxella catarrhalis (mic90, 0.25 microgram/ml), and some haemophilus influenzae (mic50, 2 micrograms/ml). rpr 106972 and quinupristin/dalfopristin demonstrated little activity against enterococcus faecalis (mic90s, 4 to 32 micrograms/ml) as compared to enterococcus faecium (mic90s, 0.5 to 1 microgram/ml) and other enterococcus ssp. (mic90s, 1 microgram/ml). studies to establish mic quality-control guidelines indicated the following ranges: for e. faecalis atcc 29212, 0.5 to 4 micrograms/ml; for s. aureus atcc 29213, 0.25 to 1 microgram/ml;  and for streptococcus pneumoniae atcc 49619, 0.06 to 0.5 microgram/ml. the results of this study indicate that the in vitro activity of rpr 106972 against gram-positive bacteria and selected gram-negative respiratory organisms is promising and warrants additional studies of pharmacokinetics, and in vivo infection model dynamics.

TI  == differential induction of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in whole blood by  bacteria: effects of antibiotic treatment.
AB  == the in vitro production of interleukin-1beta (il-1beta), il-6, and the il-1 receptor antagonist (il-1ra) in whole blood upon stimulation with different bacterial strains was measured to study the possible relationship between disease severity and the cytokine-inducing capacities of these strains. escherichia coli, neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, bacteroides fragilis, capnocytophaga canimorsus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes induced the cytokines il-1beta, il-6, and il-1ra. gram-negative bacteria induced significantly higher levels of proinflammatory cytokine production than gram-positive bacteria. these  differences were less pronounced for the anti-inflammatory cytokine il-1ra. in addition, blood was stimulated with e. coli killed by different antibiotics to study the effect of the antibiotics on the cytokine-inducing capacity of the bacterial culture. e. coli treated with cefuroxime and gentamicin induced higher  levels of il-1beta and il-6 production but levels of il-1ra production similar to that of heat-killed e. coli. in contrast, ciprofloxacin- and imipenem-cilastatin-mediated killing showed a decreased or similar level of induction of cytokine production as compared to that by heat-killed e. coli; polymyxin b decreased the level of production of the cytokines.

TI  == comparison of the indigenous oral microbiota and immunoglobulin responses of athymic (nu/nu) and euthymic (nu/+) mice.
AB  == the role of the immune system in the homeostasis of indigenous oral bacterial populations is poorly understood. in this study, we compared the evolution of the indigenous oral microbiota of specific pathogen-free athymic nude (nu/nu) balb/c  mice with that of their corresponding phenotypically normal (nu/-) littermates. we also evaluated corresponding salivary and serum antibody activities (iga and igg) against the predominant indigenous oral bacteria. the bacterial species recovered from the two mouse strains were lactobacillus murinus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus oralis and staphylococcus epidermidis. from 27 days of age, nu/+ and nu/nu mice had significantly different proportions of oral bacterial populations. when the microbiota stabilized (at 40 days of age), the total cultivable microbiota of nu/+ mice was dominated by l. murinus (65-85%), while that of nu/nu mice was dominated by e. faecalis (40-60%). the precise factors that alter the oral resident microbiota in nu/nu mice are unknown. we found that total salivary iga levels were significantly lower in nu/nu mice, but  no association were observed between the level of salivary iga antibody against indigenous bacteria and the proportion of these indigenous bacteria in the oral microbiota. the change in the microbiota of nude mice may have been caused by other factors such as defects in other immune functions or cold stress.

AB  == the in vitro activity of ru-59863, a so-called "fifth generation" catechol cephalosporin, was evaluated against 606 bacterial isolates and compared with the activities of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, and cefpirome. ru-59863 demonstrated a broad spectrum of inhibition and superior overall activity than comparators when tested against enterobacteriaciae (mic90s, 0.015 to 2 micrograms/ml), pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 0.5 microgram/ml), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic90, 0.25 microgram/ml), acinetobacter ssp. (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), and oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus ssp. (mic90s,  0.5 to 8 micrograms/ml). potent ru-59863 activity was also observed against beta-haemolytic and viridans gr. streptococci (mic90s, 0.12-0.5 microgram/ml), streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90s, 0.03 to 0.5 microgram/ml), haemophilus influenzae (mic90, 0.06 microgram/ml), and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mic90, 0.06 micrograms/ml). ru-59863 demonstrated marginal potency against enterococcus faecalis (mics 2 to 16 micrograms/ml) and was inactive against enterococcus faecium (mic90, > 128 micrograms/ml). oxacillin-resistant staphylococci were not  inhibited by ru-59863 (mic90s, 32 to 128 micrograms/ml). among the cephalosporins tested, ru-59863 performed best versus ceftazidime-resistant bush group 1 isolates and strains producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases. ru-59863 was also effective against many fluoroquinolone-, aminoglycoside-, and imipenem-resistant isolates. ru-59863 seems to be a significant advance in cephalosporin chemistry and activity, especially against gram-negative pathogens  resistant to current beta-lactam therapeutic agents. further studies of human pharmacokinetics and against clinical infections are encouraged.

AB  == the phosphorylcholine (pc) determinant in streptococcus pneumoniae is known to be linked to the cell wall polysaccharides (c-ps) and to the lipoteichoic acid (lta) (forssman antigen) of the plasma membrane. western blotting with two pc specific  murine monoclonal antibodies (mabs) designated 145,f-2 (igm) and 147,a-1 (iga) showed a similar ladder-like pattern for all examined strains of s. pneumoniae and streptococcus mitis. purified antigens run in parallel indicated that this ladder pattern is due to the pc of lta. unlike other techniques, western blotting thus enables the identification of only one of the streptococcal structures carrying the pc epitope. gram-negative organisms were also examined, and six of 11 haemophilus influenzae strains reacted with the mabs. for this species, unlike the streptococci, only one fast moving band was detected. analyses by thin-layer  chromatography (tlc) detected the pc epitope in lipopolysaccharide (lps) fraction from h. influenzae. some strains of the neisseriaceae family were also positive by western blotting, but tlc and immunostaining did not detect the pc determinant in lps.

TI  == development of provisional disc diffusion breakpoints for testing quinupristin/dalfopristin.
AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin is an injectable streptogramin with broad activity against many gram-positive bacteria, including streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium. although a number of studies have reported the mics of this compound against a variety of bacteria, there are no published reports of disc diffusion testing. we tested total disc masses of 7.5 and 15 micrograms with varying ratios of the component compounds, quinupristin and dalfopristin, combined in the following quinupristin: dalfopristin ratios (in microgram): 7.5:0, 0:7.5, 10:5, 5:10, 5:2.5 and 2.5:5. zone diameters and mics were determined in parallel for 44 isolates of staphylococci, 47 isolates pneumococci and 64 isolates of enterococci. control strains were included for each species tested, including a strain of enterococcus faecalis with known resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin. using tentative definitions for quinupristin/dalfopristin of < or = 2 mg/l as susceptible and > or = 4 mg/l as resistant, each of the four discs containing ratios of both component compounds separated presumptive susceptible organisms from resistant ones better than either quinupristin or dalfopristin alone. the best correlation of zone sizes and mics for predicting susceptibility to quinupristin/dalfopristin at an mic of < or = 2 mg/l was achieved with the 5 micrograms:10 micrograms disc and a zone diameter of > or = 18 mm. these criteria may be useful for identifying organisms  that are presumptively susceptible to quinupristin/dalfopristin.

TI  == microbiological cultures of heart valves and valve tags are not valuable for patients without infective endocarditis who are undergoing valve replacement.
AB  == we evaluated the significance of the results of microbiological cultures of heart valves and identification tags from newly inserted prosthetic valves that were removed from patients with valvular heart disease; none of these patients had a preoperative diagnosis of endocarditis. we reviewed the charts of patients with positive cultures for evidence of infections before or after surgery. cultures were positive for 11.9% of 219 valves (206 native valves and 13 prosthetic or bioprosthetic valves) and 11.6% of 224 tags. the most common isolates were coagulase-negative staphylococci. typical agents of endocarditis--viridans streptococcus, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus--were cultured from five specimens, and mycobacterium avium complex was identified in six valves. none of the patients with positive valve or tag cultures developed postsurgical endocarditis or wound infection. findings on histopathologic examination of the valves were not consistent with endocarditis. we conclude that the results of cultures of valves from patients without preoperative diagnoses of endocarditis lack clinical significance, and positive tag cultures are not predictive of postsurgical infection. positive cultures are most likely a result  of contamination during surgery or thereafter.

TI  == limited diversity of streptococcus pneumoniae psaa among pneumococcal vaccine serotypes.
AB  == the pneumococcal surface adhesin a (psaa) is a surface-exposed protein of the gram-positive bacterium streptococcus pneumoniae. it belongs to a group of proteins designated the lipoprotein receptor i antigen family. the gene encoding  psaa from an encapsulated strain of pneumococcal serotype 6b was cloned and sequenced. the peptide sequence was compared to that of homologs found in s. pneumoniae serotype 2, viridans streptococci, and enterococcus faecalis. identity values among the deduced peptides ranged from 57 to 98%. the polymorphism of psaa was examined among the 23 encapsulated vaccine serotypes by using pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. ten different enzymes were used to analyze 80 strains representing the 23 serotypes in a 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine. this analysis showed that restriction sites within the gene were highly conserved, with only a minor variation occurring in 10% of the strains, the result of an additional tsp509i site. the lack of variation for the other restriction sites within the gene examined here indicates that psaa is genetically conserved, an important characteristic necessary for a candidate common protein vaccine.

TI  == antimicrobial characteristics of quinupristin/dalfopristin (synercid at 30:70 ratio) compared to alternative ratios for in vitro testing.
AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin is a new streptogramin combination that occurs at a natural ratio and formulation of 30:70. rapid metabolism of the dalfopristin component to rp 12536 in vivo puts in question the validity of in vitro test of spectrum with the parent combination. in studies of quinupristin with both dalfopristin and rp 12536, a wide range of ratios (30:70, 50:50, 70:30) were tested by reference mic and mbc tests. no significant potency differences were observed between combination ratios or metabolic components when testing 256 bacterial strains. quinupristin/dalfopristin or quinupristin/rp 12536 remained active, by bactericidal action against many staphylococci and streptococcus ssp.  enterococcus faecium strains were susceptible (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml; static effect only) to the streptogramin, but e. faecalis, pasteurella multocida, pediococcus ssp., haemophilus influenzae, and bacteroides fragilis were generally less susceptible (mic90, > or = 8 micrograms/ml). the log phase inoculum was preferred for mbc and kill-curve tests with this combination. the 30:70 ratio in  vitro susceptibility test of quinupristin/dalfopristin as used to date, seems to  predict the potency and spectrum of this streptogramin accurately and all clinically important in vivo ratios of the injectable form or its major metabolites. quinupristin/dalfopristin should be further investigated for clinical use against emerging resistant gram-positive infections, especially penicillin-resistant streptococci and glycopeptide-resistant e. faecium that exhibit susceptibility in this investigation.

TI  == the activity of the methylpiperazinyl fluoroquinolone cg 5501: a comparison with  other fluoroquinolones.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of cg 5501 against a wide range of recent clinical isolates was compared with that of three fluoroquinolones. cg 5501 inhibited 90% of the species of the family enterobacteriaceae at 0.5 mg/l or less, exceptions being enterobacter spp. (mic90 2 mg/l) and serratia spp. (mic90 4 mg/l). ninety per cent of pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and acinetobacter spp. were inhibited by 16, 4 and 1 mg/l respectively. cg 5501 had high activity against gram-positive cocci, 90% of staphylococci being inhibited at 2 mg/l. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains were generally ciprofloxacin-resistant yet were all susceptible to 4 mg/l or less of cg 5501. isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae were eight-fold more susceptible to cg 5501  (mic90 0.5 mg/l) than to ciprofloxacin (mic90 4 mg/l) and the former had a similar activity to that of trovafloxacin and sparfloxacin. enterococcus faecalis was generally two- to four-fold more susceptible to cg 5501 or trovafloxacin than to ciprofloxacin. cg 5501 and trovafloxacin had high activity against bacteroides fragilis (mic90 0.25 mg/l). five strains of chlamydia spp. were inhibited by < or =0.12 mg/l of cg 5501; sensitive and multiresistant strains of mycobacterium tuberculosis were inhibited by < or =0.5 mg/l of cg 5501. the high activity and breadth of its antibacterial spectrum suggests that cg 5501 should be useful in a wide range of clinical infections.

TI  == synthesis by an alpha-glucosidase of glycosyl-trehaloses with an isomaltosyl residue.
AB  == glycosyl-trehaloses with an isomaltosyl residue were synthesized by alpha-glucosidase from aspergillus niger by using maltotetraose as a glucosyl donor and trehalose as the acceptor. the one trisaccharide and two tetrasaccharides formed were isolated by successive column chromatography. the results of an enzymatic digestion, methylation analysis, and 13c-nmr studies indicated that these oligosaccharides were alpha-isomaltosyl alpha-glucoside, alpha-isomaltotriosyl alpha-glucoside and alpha-isomaltoside. these oligosaccharides were not fermented to an acid by streptococcus mutans, and they  effectively inhibited water-insoluble glucan synthesis from sucrose by glucosyltransferase. in an in vitro utilization test with human intestinal bacteria, these oligosaccharides were predominantly utilized by bifidobacteria.

TI  == use of an excision reporter plasmid to study the intracellular mobility of the conjugative transposon tn916 in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == an excision reporter plasmid was constructed to characterize the intracellular mobility of tn916 in various gram-positive bacteria. the reporter component of this plasmid is a chloramphenicol-resistance gene which has been insertionally inactivated with the integrative vector pat112 containing the attachment site of  tn916. tn916-mediated excision of pat112, to produce clones resistant to chloramphenicol, was detected in enterococcus faecalis bm4110, listeria monocytogenes l028-str and streptococcus gordonii bm120, but not in lactococcus lactis mg1363-rf or in streptococcus pneumoniae bm124, and always depended upon the ability of the bacterial host to generate circular forms of the transposon. the results suggest that (i) the excision event, although required, is not sufficient for conjugal transfer to occur and (ii) there is no linear relationship between the donor potential of e. faecalis strains and either the excision frequency of pat112 or the copy number of tn916 circular intermediates per cell in these hosts. excision of pat112 occurred mainly during the late exponential phase of growth of e. faecalis and l. monocytogenes and this recombination event was not stimulated by heat shock, salt and alcohol stresses or by the presence of tetracycline in the medium.

TI  == [comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1995). i. susceptibility distribution].
AB  == the frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 704 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (utis) in 11 hospitals during the period of june 1995 to may 1996. of  the above bacterial isolates, gram-positive bacteria accounted for 29.8% and a majority of them were enterococcus faecalis. gram-negative bacteria accounted for 70.2% and most of them were escherichia coli. susceptibilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. enterococcus faecalis ampicillin (abpc) and imipenem (ipm) showed the highest activities against e. faecalis isolated from patients with utis. the mic90s of them were 1 microgram/ml. vancomycin (vcm) and piperacillin (pipc) were also active with the  mic90s of 2 micrograms/ml and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. the others had low activities with the mic90s of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. staphylococcus aureus including mrsa vcm showed the highest activities against s. aureus isolated from  patients with utis. its mic90 was 1 microgram/ml against both s. aureus and mrsa. arbekacin (abk) was also active with the mic90 of 2 micrograms/ml. the other except minocycline (mino) had very low activities with the mic90s of 64 micrograms/ml or above. 3. staphylococcus epidermidis abk and mino showed the strongest activities against s. epidermidis isolated from patients with utis. the mic90s of them were 0.25 microgram/ml. vcm was also active with the mic90 of 1 microgram/ml. the mic90s of cephems ranged from 2 micrograms/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in 1994, but they ranged from 8 micrograms/ml to 128 micrograms/ml  in 1995. these results indicated that some resistances existed among s. epidermidis to cephems. 4. streptococcus agalactiae all drugs except gentamicin (gm) were active against s. agalactiae. abpc, cefmenoxime (cmx), ipm, erythromycin (em), clindamycin (cldm) and clarithromycin (cam) showed the highest activities. the mics for all strains were lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. the mic90s of the others were 2 micrograms/ml or below. 5. citrobacter freundii ipm showed the highest activity against c. freundii isolated from patients utis. its  mic90 was 1 microgram/ml. gm was also active with the mic90 of 2 micrograms/ml. cefpirome (cpr), cefozopran (czop) and amikacin (amk) were also active with the mic90s of 4 micrograms/ml. penicillins and cephems except cmx, cpr and czop showed low activities with mic90s of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 6. enterobacter  cloacae ipm showed the highest activity against e. cloacae. the mics for all strains were equal to or lower than 1 microgram/ml. mino and tosufloxacin (tflx)  were also active with the mic90s of 8 micrograms/ml. penicillins and cephems except cpr and czop showed lower activities with the mic90s of 256 micrograms/ml  or above. 7. escherichia coli. most of the antimicrobial agents were active against e. coli. particularly cpr, czop and ipm showed the highest activities against e. coli. the mics for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.5 microgram/ml. cmx and tflx were also active with the mic90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. penicillins were slightly active with mic90s of 128 micrograms/ml or above. 8. klebsiella pneumoniae k. pneumoniae was susceptible to all drugs except penicillins, with mic90s of 2 micrograms/ml or below. carumonam (crmn) had the strongest activity against k. pneumoniae, the mics for all strains were equal to  or lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. comparing with the result of 1994, the sensitivities of k. pneumoniae against all drugs had obviously changed into a better state. for example, the mic90s of cephems ranged from 0.25 microgram/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in 1994, but they were all lower than 2 micrograms/ml in 1995. 9. proteus mirabilis p. mirabilis was susceptible to a majority of drugs. cmx, ceftazidime (caz), cefixime (cfix), and crmn showed the highest activities against p. mirabilis isolated from patients with utis. mics of crmn for all

TI  == in vitro irradiation of infected root canals with a diode laser: results of microbiologic, infrared spectrometric, and stain penetration examinations.
AB  == this study aimed to examine the suitability of the diode laser with a wavelength  of 810 nm for reducing bacteria in root canals. forty-four extracted, endodontically prepared teeth were inoculated with escherichia coli and streptococcus faecalis. no bacterial growth was observed when the teeth were irradiated at an output power of 4 w and a pulse rate of 10 milliseconds, with breaks of 10 milliseconds between the irradiations. exposure time was five times  5 seconds. infrared spectroscopic examinations revealed that irradiation at 4 w under even circling movements resulted in a maximum rise in temperature of 6 degrees c on the root surface. stain penetration tests and scanning electron microscopic examinations revealed complete closure of the dentinal tubules on the irradiated root canal walls.

TI  == primary and secondary structures of rrna spacer regions in enterococci.
AB  == the 16s-23s and 23s-5s rrna spacer dna regions (spacer regions 1 and 2, respectively) from enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus durans and enterococcus mundtii were amplified by pcr. their  nucleotide sequences were established and a secondary structure model showing the interaction between the two spacer regions was built. whereas lactococci and streptococcus sensu stricto are characterized by a single type of spacer region 1, the enterococci show a high degree of variability in this region; thus the spacer regions 1 with and without trna(ala) were characterized. however, as shown for lactococci and streptococcus sensu stricto, the trna(ala) gene does not encode the 3'-terminal cca trinucleotide. a putative antitermination signal is found downstream from the trna(ala) gene. based on comparison with lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus, a double-stranded processing stem is proposed. in e, hirae, one of the three different types of spacer region 1 contains no trna(ala), but displays a 107 nt insertion that forms a long stem-loop structure. a similar insertion (115 nt in length) was found in e. faecium and base compensatory mutations preserve the ability to form the long stem-loop structure. such insertions may correspond to mobile intervening sequences, as found in the 23s rrna coding sequences of some gram-negative bacteria. the spacer regions 1 and 2 from the three subgroups of streptococci were compared, and except for the trna(ala) gene and the double-stranded processing sites, little similarity was found, which opens large possibilities for future development of dna-based typing methods.

TI  == plasmid integration in a wide range of bacteria mediated by the integrase of lactobacillus delbrueckii bacteriophage mv4.
AB  == bacteriophage mv4 is a temperate phage infecting lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. during lysogenization, the phage integrates its genome into the host  chromosome at the 3' end of a trna(ser) gene through a site-specific recombination process (l. dupont et al., j. bacteriol., 177:586-595, 1995). a nonreplicative vector (pmc1) based on the mv4 integrative elements (attp site and integrase-coding int gene) is able to integrate into the chromosome of a wide range of bacterial hosts, including lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus casei  (two strains), lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae. integrative recombination of pmc1 into the chromosomes  of all of these species is dependent on the int gene product and occurs specifically at the pmc1 attp site. the isolation and sequencing of pmc1 integration sites from these bacteria showed that in lactobacilli, pmc1 integrated into the conserved trna(ser) gene. in the other bacterial species where this trna gene is less or not conserved; secondary integration sites either in potential protein-coding regions or in intergenic dna were used. a consensus sequence was deduced from the analysis of the different integration sites. the comparison of these sequences demonstrated the flexibility of the integrase for the bacterial integration site and suggested the importance of the trinucleotide  cct at the 5' end of the core in the strand exchange reaction.

TI  == tissue penetration of meropenem in patients undergoing gynecologic surgery.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to assess the tissue-penetrating ability of a new beta-lactam antibiotic, meropenem, in 64 patients undergoing elective gynecologic surgery. patients received a single 500-mg dose intravenously before surgery. plasma and tissue concentrations of meropenem were highest at approximately 1 hour, and good tissue penetration was seen in the variety of specimens evaluated. the median plasma concentration at approximately 1 hour was 13.3 micrograms/ml. the median fluid and tissue concentrations at approximately 1 hour were as follows: cervix, 8.5 micrograms/g; endometrium, 2.3 micrograms/g; fallopian tube, 1.9 micrograms/g; myometrium, 3.6 micrograms/g; ovary, 2.3 micrograms/g; and uterus, 2.3 micrograms/g. these tissue concentrations exceed the mics of meropenem for 90% of typical pathogens associated with gynecologic infections. meropenem readily penetrates gynecologic tissue. a single 500-mg dose provides adequate tissue concentrations for treatment of gynecologic infections caused by  susceptible pathogens.

TI  == multidrug-resistant gram-positive pathogens. an update on current microbiological patterns.
AB  == although resistance has developed among gram-positive pathogens to penicillins, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, quinolones and macrolides, the glycopeptides seem to remain largely unaffected. however, the recent emergence and range of glycopeptide resistance in enterococci, well documented in the usa but not in the rest of the world, have prompted this european surveillance study. the european glycopeptide resistance survey was undertaken in 1995 in 9 countries and involved 70 microbiological centres. the primary aims of the survey were as follows: (i) to perform a microbiological quality assurance assessment to evaluate the ability of participating laboratories to correctly identify the strains and assess their  glycopeptide susceptibility; and (ii) to accurately determine the level of glycopeptide resistance among staphylococci, streptococci and enterococci in european hospitals. the in vitro activity of several other antibiotics was assessed on strains isolated from the italian centres. in total, 7078 gram-positive isolates were collected in europe, and national coordinators used the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) agar dilution reference method to successfully retest 96% of these. according to mode minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics), teicoplanin activity was similar to that of vancomycin against staphylococcus aureus. in general, the range of mics for teicoplanin was wider than that for vancomycin against coagulase-negative staphylococci. against enterococcus spp. and streptococcus spp., teicoplanin was  4 times more active than vancomycin. the greatest number of glycopeptide refractory organisms was evident among enterococci; resistance was observed to be approximately 10 times more frequent in enterococcus faecium than in e. faecalis. the results from the italian isolates were similar to those from the overall study. in particular, teicoplanin was 2- to 8-fold more active than vancomycin against the majority of the enterococci. the incidence of enterococcal resistance was lower in italy (0.6% for teicoplanin and 0.9% for vancomycin) than in europe  (1.7% for teicoplanin and 2.3% for vancomycin). this extensive survey confirms that teicoplanin is more active than vancomycin against enterococci and streptococci, and that both display similar potency against staphylococci.

TI  == glucose starvation response in enterococcus faecalis jh2-2: survival and protein  analysis.
AB  == we investigated the survival of enterococcus faecalis following starvation provoked by energy source glucose exhaustion. inhibition of protein synthesis by  chloramphenicol before 3 h of starvation resulted in a dramatic decrease in viable bacteria. antibiotic treatment of cells after 3 or 6 h of starvation had a progressively lesser influence on bacterial survival. during the first 24 h of deprivation, a total of 42 proteins were identified as glucose-starvation-inducible; 4 temporal classes of proteins (a, b, c and d) were defined in relation to their enhanced synthesis after glucose exhaustion. our results show that proteins from the two early classes (a and b) seem to be the most important for long-term survival in e. faecalis. one protein of each of these classes was analysed at the molecular level. the n-terminal sequence of one of them, belonging to class a, showed strong homology with the n-terminal sequence of carbamate kinase from streptococcus faecium. this enzyme could be implicated in the development of alternative metabolic pathways of energy production and could be compared to the cst proteins of escherichia coli.

TI  == cell-cell communication in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == in gram-positive bacteria, many important processes are controlled by cell-to-cell communication, which is mediated by extracellular signal molecules produced by the bacteria. most of these signaling molecules are peptides or modified peptides. signal processing, in most cases, involves either transduction across the cytoplasmic membrane or import of the signal and subsequent interaction with intracellular effectors. concentrations of signal in the nanomolar range or below are frequently sufficient for biological activity. the microbial processes controlled by extracellular signaling include the expression  of virulence factors, the expression of gene transfer functions, and the production of antibiotics.

TI  == [1996 pathogen incidence and resistance status in peritonitis].
AB  == severe intra-abdominal infection is associated with a high mortality rate. in addition to risk factors in the patients, the causal pathogens and the selection  of appropriate therapeutic procedures play an essential part in the course of these conditions. in the majority of intra-abdominal infections mixed aerobic/anaerobic infections, mostly with some involvement of enterobacteria and  also of enterococci and staphylococci can be demonstrated. in addition to surgical intervention a calculated antimicrobial initial treatment of intra-abdominal infections with an antibiotic with an adequate effect to combat the pathogen concerned can contribute to improving the patient's prognosis. a calculated antibiotic treatment can only be effectively and reliably carried through if the frequency of the pathogen and the resistance situation are known.  retrospective evaluations of data on the sensitivity and frequency of pathogens from a defined group of subjects allow conclusions on the epidemiological situation in a particular catchment area or in a medical sector and thus make it  possible to calculate the appropriate therapy for infections. in 1996 a total of  2,779 bacterial isolates from the intra-abdominal infection sector were examined: 935 enterobacteriaceae, 83 nonfermenters, 177 staphylococcus spp., 211 enterococcus spp., 39 streptococcus spp., and 1334 different anaerobic bacteria.  fresh clinical isolates were available for all pathogens tested. the most frequent gram-negative pathogen was e. coli (60%) and the most frequent gram-positive pathogen, e. faecalis (44%); the most frequent anaerobic pathogen was b. fragilis (39%). taurolodine had the lowest resistance rate against gram-negative and anaerobic pathogens. teicoplanin had the highest activity against gram-positive pathogens.

AB  == streptococcus bovis nem760 was isolated from a stool swab collected on admission  from a patient as surveillance for vancomycin-resistant enterococci. strain nem760 was identified as s. bovis by conventional biochemical methods and partial sequence analysis of its 16s rrna. this strain was resistant to a low level of vancomycin (mic, 64 micrograms/ml) but was susceptible to teicoplanin (mic, 1 micrograms/ml), and vancomycin induced resistance to both glycopeptides. the presence of a vanb-related gene in nem760 was demonstrated in a pcr assay which enabled specific amplification of a 635-hp internal segment of vanb. sequence analysis of the corresponding pcr product revealed that it was highly homologous  (96% identity) to the prototype vanb sequence of enterococcus faecalis v583. the  vanb resistance of determinant of s. bovis nem760 was transferred by conjugation  to e. faecalis and enterococcus faecium at a similar frequency of 2 x 10(-5) per  donor. smai-digested genomic dnas of independently obtained transconjugants of e. faecalis and e. faecium were analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and southern hybridization with a vanb dna probe. the electrophoretic and hybridization patterns obtained with all transconjugants of the same species were indistinguishable and revealed vanb-containing chromosomal insertions of approximately 100 kb. these results suggest that the genes mediating vanb-type resistance in s. bovis nem760 are part of large transferable genetic elements. the results presented in the report demonstrate for the first time the role of streptococci in the dissemination of vancomycin resistance among gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == bactericidal activity of trovafloxacin (cp-99,219).
AB  == trovafloxacin was found to be a typical quinolone producing a biphasic dose response against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus pneumoniae. a reduced rate of kill was seen against enterococcus faecalis, which  is also typical of the quinolones. however, the bactericidal activity of trovafloxacin against s. aureus and s. pneumoniae was greater than most other quinolones previously tested. the enhanced bactericidal activity of trovafloxacin against s. aureus may be explained by the possession of a very strong bactericidal mechanism b. trovafloxacin may prove to be a quinolone of choice against s. aureus infections.

TI  == effects of a mixture of organisms, lactobacillus acidophilus or streptococcus faecalis on cholesterol metabolism in rats fed on a fat- and cholesterol-enriched diet.
AB  == the effect of a mixture of organisms (a probiotic mixture) comprising bacillus, lactobacillus, streptococcus, clostridium, saccharomyces and candida (10(7-8) colony-forming units/g rice bran of each component) on lipid metabolism was compared with that of l. acidophilus and that of s. faecalis. there were four treatment groups: rice bran (control), the mixture of organisms, l. acidophilus or s. faecalis (30 g/kg) were given to rats in a fat- and cholesterol-enriched diet for 4 weeks. the serum total cholesterol concentration of the group fed on the mixture of organisms was reduced by 15-33% compared with the other groups at  the end of the 4-week feeding period (p < 0.05). this group also had a lower hepatic cholesterol concentration (36-44%) than the two single-bacteria groups (p < 0.05). 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-co a reductase (nadph; ec 1.1.1.34) activities of the mixed-organism and l. acidophilus groups were significantly lower (61-63%) than those of the other groups (p < 0.05); the activity of the s.  faecalis group was also significantly lower (42%) than that of the control group  (p < 0.05). the faecal cholesterol and bile acid concentrations of the mixed-organism group increased compared with those of the l. acidophilus and s. faecalis groups (p < 0.05). the capacity of the mixed-organism cells to bind bile salt in vitro was significantly higher (approximately 50%) than that of the single-bacteria cells (p < 0.05). on the other hand, cholesterol micelle formation for the mixed-organism cells was significantly (approximately 9%) lower than that of the single-bacteria cells (p < 0.05). these results indicate that the mixture of organisms decreased the synthesis of cholesterol in the liver and  increased the loss of steroids from the intestine, in rats. thus, the mixture of  organisms had a hypocholesterolaemic role.

TI  == leuconostoc bacteremia in an infant with short-gut syndrome: case report and literature review.
AB  == in this article, we report a case of leuconostoc bacteremia in a 7-month-old infant who had short-gut syndrome after a gastroschisis repair and who was dependent on total parenteral nutrition through a central venous catheter. the organism was initially misidentified as viridans group streptococcus. detection of vancomycin resistance led to the correct diagnosis of leuconostoc species. the patient was successfully treated with ampicillin and an aminoglycoside. a review  of the literature revealed prematurity, short-gut syndrome, prior vancomycin use, and central venous catheters as important predisposing factors. leuconostoc species is an emerging pathogen that should be considered in the differential diagnosis of vancomycin-resistant gram-positive bacteremia, particularly in these clinical settings.

AB  == background: infective endocarditis is a systemic disease in which there are a continuously antigenic stimulation of immunologic system. streptococcus is still  the most frequent cause of infective endocarditis. patients and methods: we investigated the presence of antibody (ab), total and igm by indirect immune fluorescence technique, in four groups of population: streptococcal infective endocarditis (sie), streptococcal bacteraemia (sb), staphylococcus aureus endocarditis, and healthy people. antigens used were: 1) their own strain isolated from the blood of patients with sie and sb inverted question markhomologous ab inverted question mark, and; 2) seven species of streptococcus: streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus sanguis i, streptococcus sanguis ii, nutritional dependent streptococci and enterococcus faecalis (heterologous ab). results: homologous antibodies: titers > or = 1/512 were found in all patients with sie and only in 2 with sb (sensitivity 100% and specificity 93%). igm titer (threshold 1/32) was positive only in patients with sie (sensitivity 75,5% and specificity 100%). the  fall of the ab titer was continuous and slow, despite the good clinical evolution of patients. (ab titers were > or = 1/512 and igm > or = 1/64 in 30% of patients  1 year later). heterologous ab: in spite of statistically significant difference  found in sie versus the other groups, sensitivity of this test (threshold 1/256)  is low, confidence interval include expected random value (50%), specificity is 88%. conclusions: the utility of homologous ab for diagnosing infective endocarditis is demonstrated. on the contrary for heterologous ab, antigenic common fractions must be found in the different species.

TI  == pseudo-outbreak of enterococcus durans infections and colonization associated with introduction of an automated identification system software update.
AB  == enterococci are an important cause of hospital-acquired infections. since 1989, there has been an increase in the number of nosocomial enterococcal infections caused by strains resistant to vancomycin in the united states. although many enterococcal species can colonize humans, only enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, e. raffinosus, and e. casseliflavus have been implicated in clusters of infection. in january 1996, the centers for disease control and prevention received a report of an outbreak of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in which 31  of 84 (36.9%) isolates were identified as e. durans. twenty-nine isolates identified as e. durans were identified to the species level after the introduction of an automated identification system software update (vitek gram-positive identification card, version r09.1) for the identification of species of gram-positive organisms. when seven isolates initially reported as e.  durans were identified to the species level by alternate methods, they were found to be e. faecium. subsequently, isolates identified as e. durans by the automated system were reidentified by using a rapid streptococcus test, and no further enterococcal isolate has been confirmed as e. durans. automated microbial analysis is a potential source of error that is not easily recognized. when laboratory findings are discordant with expected clinical or epidemiologic patterns, confirmatory testing by alternate methods should be performed.

TI  == candida albicans binding to the oral bacterium streptococcus gordonii involves multiple adhesin-receptor interactions.
AB  == candida albicans binds to several species of oral streptococci, in particular streptococcus gordonii, through recognition of a streptococcal cell wall polysaccharide receptor (a. r. holmes, p. k. gopal, and h. f. jenkinson, infect.  immun. 63:1827-1834, 1995). we now show that isogenic cell surface protein mutants of s. gordonii dl1, unaltered in expression of cell wall polysaccharide,  are reduced in ability to support adherence of c. albicans cells in a solid-phase assay. inactivation of the s. gordonii csha and cshb genes, encoding high-molecular-mass cell surface polypeptides, and inactivation of the sspa and sspb genes, encoding antigen i/ii salivary adhesins, resulted in 40 and 79% reductions, respectively, in adherence of c. albicans cells. inactivation of the  s. gordonii scaa gene encoding a cell surface lipoprotein had no effect on c. albicans adherence. polyclonal antiserum to streptococcal antigen i/ii protein spap and antibodies specific to the amino-terminal nonrepetitive (nr) domain of csha both inhibited adherence of c. albicans to s. gordonii cells. conversely antibodies to the amino acid repeat block repetitive (r) domain of csha, or to scaa, did not inhibit c. albicans adherence. immobilized recombinant polypeptide  fragments of csha comprising nr domain or r domain sequences both supported adherence of c. albicans cells. expression of s. gordonii sspb protein on the surface of enterococcus faecalis conferred on the enterococcal cells the ability  to bind c. albicans, and this was ablated by antigen i/ii antiserum. collectively the results suggest that interaction of c. albicans with s. gordonii is mediated  by a complement of adhesin-receptor interactions that involves two families of streptococcal multifunctional polypeptide adhesins, bacterial cell wall polysaccharide, and as yet unidentified yeast cell surface components.

TI  == nitric oxide mediates the action of lipoteichoic acid on the function of human urothelial cells.
AB  == gram-positive bacteria are recognized pathogens in urinary tract infections. lipoteichoic acids, major components of the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria,  are important virulence attributes, but their mechanism of action is not well understood. we have postulated that infection-induced altered function of progenitors of urothelial cells (ut) residing in the basal layer is likely to have long-lasting effects on the architecture and function of the urothelium. our earlier in vitro studies in ut of basal type, grown under growth restricting conditions, have shown that 1) treatment with lipoteichoic acid from streptococcus faecalis (lt-2) stimulates a subpopulation of progenitors of urothelial cells to proliferate, and 2) resulting large colonies differentiated at an increased rate under conditions simulating those in the basal layer of the  urothelium. the hypothesis underlying the present studies was that nitric oxide (no) mediated lt-2 action on these functions of ut. immunocytochemical studies using an antibody against inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos) confirmed expression of inos in lt-2-treated ut. our hypothesis was tested by treating ut grown under growth restricting conditions (0.005% bovine pituitary extract) with  lt-2 (25 micrograms/ml), in the presence or absence of inhibitors of nos (1 mm ng-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester [l-name]; 1 microm dexamethasone [dexa]) or 25 microm hemoglobin, a potent inactivator of no. treatment with lt-2 in the presence of these agents prevented the following effects of lt-2 alone: 1) the stimulatory effect on proliferation of single cells, as well as within the resulting large colonies; 2) the subsequent differentiation of large colonies resulting from this proliferative activity, as indicated by distribution of beta  1 subunit-containing integrins to cell-cell contacts; 3) the inhibitory effect on the subsequent ability of lt-2-treated ut to attach to extracellular matrix proteins. these studies suggest that induction of nos by lt-2, initially aimed at restricting the replication of infectious agents, may have potential cost of damage to the host bladder by interfering with urothelial differentiation.

TI  == long-term treatment with lipoteichoic acid from streptococcus faecalis affects differentiation and expression and cellular distribution of beta 1 integrins in human urothelial cells.
AB  == gram-positive bacteria are recognized pathogens in urinary tract infections. cellular mechanisms triggered by lipoteichoic acids (lts), cell well components of gram-positive bacteria, have not been completely defined. we have postulated that infection-induced altered function of progenitors of urothelial cells residing in the basal layer is likely to have long lasting effects on the architecture and function of the urothelium. our recent studies in vitro showed that treatment of poorly differentiated urothelial cells of basal type with lt from streptococcus faecalis (lt-2) stimulated rapid proliferation of a subpopulation of progenitors of urothelial cells, supporting this possibility (elgavish et al., 1996, j. cell. physiol., 169:42-51). the hypothesis underlying  the present studies was that, following lt-triggered increase in proliferation of progenitors, the rate of differentiation of the resulting progeny was also stimulated. we proposed that this mechanism may allow rapid removal of cells from the injured area and replacement by cells that have not been exposed to infection. to simulate in vitro conditions in the basal layer that inhibit terminal differentiation, cells grew on fibronectin or collagen-coated substrate, in medium containing low ca2+ (0.2 mm) and low levels of growth factors (0.005% bovine pituitary extract [bpe]). during the last 3 days in culture, cells grew in the same low ca2+ (0.2 mm) medium, but without bpe, with or without lt-2. in a positive control group, cells grew during their last 3 days in culture in medium  without bpe and lt-2 but in which levels levels of ca2+ were higher (2 mm), a condition known to stimulate differentiation in other cell types. several lines of evidence supported the possibility that long-term treatment with lt-2 stimulated progression of large colonies (i.e., the progeny resulting from lt-triggered proliferation) to a more differentiated state: (1) the rate of their differentiation, determined by criterion of intense cytokeratin 8 expression, was increased; (2) steady-state level of beta mrna and expression of beta 1 subunit of integrins at the protein level were inhibited; (3) in contrast to large colonies in control cultures, the entire population of lt-2-treated large colonies contained beta 1 integrins distributed at cell-cell contacts. raising extracellular ca2+ concentration to 2 mm induced similar effects, suggesting that lt-2 may act by stimulating an increase in intracellular levels of ca2+. however, further studies will be needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the stimulatory effect of lt-2 on proliferation of progenitors of urothelial cells in the basal layer of the urothelium and subsequent differentiation of their progeny. we propose that these processes may have a causative role in the pathological changes that occur in the aftermath of chronic or recurrent suburothelial infection in the urinary bladder.

TI  == a subpopulation of human urothelial cells is stimulated to proliferate by treatment in vitro with lipoteichoic acid, a cell wall component of streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == urinary tract infection with gram-positive bacteria is common. avenues for ingress of bacteria into the bladder include luminal and suburothelial infection. terminally differentiated superficial urothelial cells lining the lumen of the bladder are often shed in response to infection. in contrast, infection-induced altered function of progenitors of urothelial cells residing in the basal layer of the urothelium is likely to have long lasting effects on the structure and function of the urothelium. the main objective of the present studies was to investigate in vitro the possibility that exposure to lipoteichoic acid, a cell wall component of the gram-positive streptococcus faecalis (lt-2), stimulates basal urothelial cells to proliferate. to simulate conditions that restrict proliferation and inhibit terminal differentiation of urothelial cells in the basal layer, secondary cultures of urothelial cells (ut) were grown on collagen or fibronectin coated substrate in medium containing low levels of ca2+ (0.2 mm)  and growth factors (0.005% bovine pituitary extract [bpe]). under these conditions, ut cultures displayed a highly reproducible colony size distribution, possibly due to the fact that colonies were progeny of basal cells with various proliferative potentials, retained in vitro. in cultures grown under growth-restricting conditions the majority of progenitors appeared to be quiescent, just like stem cells in the basal layer of the urothelium. thus, the population of large colonies (more than six cells/colony), was small when a steady state of growth was achieved, 3-7 days after seeding. growth factors (0.005-0.5% bpe) caused a dose-dependent increase in this population of large colonies. moreover, treatment of ut grown under growth-restricting conditions (0.005% bpe) with lt-2 increased steady-state levels of the population of large colonies to levels obtained in cultures growing under optimal conditions with respect to growth factors. these results indicated that the subpopulation of progenitors, quiescent under normal conditions, could be stimulated to proliferate. two lines of evidence were consistent with the possibility that treatment with lt-2 stimulated proliferation of the subpopulation of progenitors  and that large colonies were the progeny of this subpopulation of single cells: (1) treatment with lt-2 increased the percentage of single cells that incorporated bromodeoxyuridine (i.e., proliferated) in a time-dependent manner. (2) an increase in the percentage of large colonies was found following lt-2-triggered proliferation of single cells. we propose that, under normal conditions, cells produced in response to lt-2-triggered proliferation of stem cells are removed from the system due to an increased rate of differentiation followed by apoptosis. recurrent infection and inflammation may not allow these processes to proceed effectively, resulting in chronic injury to the bladder. moreover, under conditions in which stem cells accumulate mutations that incapacitate their progeny to undergo apoptosis, lt-triggered proliferation could be a contributing factor to tumorigenesis.

TI  == influence of lipoteichoic acid structure on recognition by the macrophage scavenger receptor.
AB  == lipoteichoic acids (ltas) belong to the immunostimulatory class of molecules of gram-positive bacteria (gpb). previous investigations showed that the macrophage  scavenger receptor (sr), a glycosylated trimeric transmembrane protein, binds directly to many gpb, possibly via lta. sr binding to other ligands is dependent  upon the spatial characteristics of the repeating negative charge of the ligand.  we therefore investigated sr recognition of lta species with various charge densities and distributions by determining the capacity of these ltas to compete  with the binding of metabolically labeled sr to beads coated with the known sr ligand polyguanylic acid. staphylococcus aureus lta, a classical lta type (unbranched 1,3-linked polyglycerophosphate chain covalently bound to a membrane  diacylglyceroglycolipid), had a 50% inhibitory concentration (ic50) for inhibition of sr binding of 0.84 microg/ml. when the s. aureus lta was rendered more negatively charged by removal of ester-linked alanine from the polyglycerophosphate backbone, the ic50 dropped to 0.23 microg/ml. other polyglycerophosphate ltas from enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus hirae, listeria monocytogenes, listeria welshimeri, and streptococcus sanguis showed ic50s of 0.5 to 2.1 microg/ml, supporting the role of negative charge in binding to sr. accordingly, the zwitterionic lta of streptococcus pneumoniae and clostridium innocuum lta substituted with positively charged sugar residues had no binding capacity. monoglycerophosphate branches, but not succinyl ester, affected binding of lipoglycans. the data presented above parallel the previous findings for whole organisms and support the role of surface-associated lta as a major ligand of gpb for binding to sr. whether binding of lta and whole gpb to macrophages initiates uptake and degradation or results in signal transduction remains to be determined.

AB  == diffuse reflectance-absorbance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ft-ir) was used to analyse 19 hospital isolates which had been identified by conventional means to one enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, streptococcus bovis, s. mitis, s. pneumoniae, or s. pyogenes. principal components analysis of the ft-ir spectra showed that this 'unsupervised' learning method failed to form six  separable clusters (one of each species) and thus could not be used to identify these bacteria base on their ft-ir spectra. by contrast, artificial neural networks (anns) could be trained by 'supervised' learning (using the back-propagation algorithm) with the principal components scores of derivatised spectra to recognise the strains from their ft-ir spectra. these results demonstrate that the combination of ft-ir and anns provides a rapid, novel and accurate bacterial identification technique.

TI  == in vivo activities of u-100592 and u-100766, novel oxazolidinone antimicrobial agents, against experimental bacterial infections.
AB  == the upjohn oxazolidinones, u-100592 and u-100766, are orally bioavailable synthetic antimicrobial agents with spectra of activity against antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens. in several mouse models of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infection, u-100592 and u-100766 yielded oral 50% effective doses (ed50) ranging from 1.9 to 8.0 mg/kg of body weight, which compared favorably with vancomycin subcutaneous ed50 values of 1.1 to 4.4 mg/kg. similarly, both compounds were active versus a staphylococcus epidermidis experimental systemic infection. u-100592 and u-100766 effectively cured an enterococcus faecalis systemic infection, with ed50 values of 1.3 and 10.0 mg/kg, and versus a vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium infection in immunocompromised mice, both drugs effected cures at 12.5 and 24.0 mg/kg. both compounds were exceptionally active in vivo against penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, with ed50 values ranging from 1.2 to 11.7 mg/kg in systemic infection models. in soft tissue infection models with s. aureus and e. faecalis, both compounds exhibited acceptable curative activities in the range of 11.0 to 39.0 mg/kg. u-100766 was also very active versus the bacteroides fragilis soft tissue infection model (ed50 = 46.3 mg/kg).  in combination-therapy studies, both u-100592 and u-100766 were indifferent or additive in vivo against a monomicrobic s. aureus infection in combination with other antibiotics active against gram-positive bacteria and combined as readily as vancomycin with gentamicin in the treatment of a polymicrobic s. aureus-escherichia coli infection. u-100592 and u-100766 are potent oxazolidinones active against antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens in experimental systemic and soft tissue infections.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of levofloxacin and ofloxacin against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the in vitro activity of levofloxacin against 506 gram-positive bacteria was compared with those of d(-)-ofloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and sparfloxacin. levofloxacin was generally twice as active as ofloxacin against these organisms (range, 0-3 twofold dilutions). sparfloxacin appeared to have the greatest activity overall, but for several groups of organisms minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic90s) of this compound were within one twofold dilution of those of levofloxacin. resistance to levofloxacin (mic > or = 8 micrograms/ml) was not encountered among streptococcal species, was rare in methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (1.7%), and was infrequent in vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium (8.7%). resistance was more common among vancomycin-resistant enterococci and methicillin-resistant staphylococci.

TI  == direct application of etest to gram-positive cocci from blood cultures: quick and reliable minimum inhibitory concentration data.
AB  == the etest was applied directly to 100 gram-positive bacterial strains from blood  cultures to measure their minimum inhibitory concentration (mic). results showed  100% concordance of mic data between a direct etest method and the standard etest method for streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and viridans group streptococci. in addition, direct etest for staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecium, and enterococcus faecalis showed 83 to 100% correlation with standard etests. these data indicate that the  etest is useful to obtain mic data on gram-positive cocci (especially streptococci) directly from positive blood cultures. the advantages of a direct etest are two fold: mic results can be obtained 24 hours earlier than standard methods and a more representative population of the bacterial isolate is tested.

TI  == the tetracycline resistance gene tet(m) exhibits mosaic structure.
AB  == tetracycline resistance genes of the m class, tet(m), are typically found on mobile genetic elements as the conjugative transposons of gram-positive bacteria. by comparing the sequences of eight different tet(m) genes (from enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, ureaplasma urealyticum, and neisseria), a mosaic structure was detected which could be traced to two distinct alleles. the two alleles displayed a divergence of 8% and  a different g/c content. the block structure of these genes provides evidence for the contribution of homologous recombination to the evolution and the heterogeneity of the tet(m) locus. unlike described cases of chromosomally located mosaic loci, tet(m) is a relatively recently acquired determinant in the  species examined and it would appear that mosaic structure within tet(m) has evolved after acquisition of the gene by the mobile genetic elements upon which it is located.

TI  == the use of gadolinium-bopta on magnetic resonance imaging in brain infection.
AB  == rationale and objectives: the use of gadolinium (gd)-bopta as a magnetic resonance contrast agent for central nervous system disease was studied in a canine brain abscess model. methods: a streptococcus faecalis brain abscess was evaluated in five dogs at 1.5t. imaging was performed during the late cerebritis  stage, at 5 to 7 days after surgery. magnetic resonance scans were acquired before and at 1, 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes after contrast administration, using a dose of 0.1 mmol/kg. scans also were acquired both before and after contrast injection with the implementation of magnetization transfer. results: lesion enhancement, quantified by region-of-interest measurement, peaked at 5 minutes after contrast injection. both the increase in lesion enhancement from 1  to 5 minutes after injection and the decrease from 5 to 15 minutes after injection, although small, were statistically significant (p < 0.004 and p < 0.03, respectively). the application of magnetization transfer improved lesion enhancement, as measured by signal difference/noise, by 39%. this result also was statistically significant (p < 0.001). conclusions: in intraparenchymal brain infection, gd-bopta provides effective lesion enhancement when used at a dose of  0.1 mmol/kg. further research is needed to compare the magnitude of enhancement achieved with gd-bopta, which has weak protein binding and both hepatobiliary and renal excretion, with that with gd chelates, which have pure renal excretion.

TI  == chromosomal gentamicin resistance transposon tn3706 in streptococcus agalactiae b128.
AB  == streptococcus agalactiae b128 is the only highly gentamicin-resistant group b streptococcal (gbs) strain described so far. this strain carries a chromosomal gentamicin resistance transposon, designated tn3706, which is similar, if not identical, to the tn4001 and tn5281 transpons detected in staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis, respectively. transposition of tn3706 occurred onto the gbs plasmid pip501 in two different loci of its 7.5-kb avaii fragment carrying the genes for chloramphenicol and erythromycin resistance. molecular analysis of pip501 derivatives showed that tn3706 is composed of a central fragment containing the aac6'-aph2" gene; this fragment is flanked by two tandemly repeated copies of is256 at the 5' extremity of the resistance gene and  a single inverted copy of is256 at its 3' extremity. the two tandemly repeated copies of is256 were separated by a 6-bp segment identical to that found, in the  same orientation, in the is256-aac6'-aph2" junction. the hybrid replicons pip501::tn3706 were found to be structurally unstable following conjugative transfer between gbs strains. numerous individual copies of is256 were detected in b128, but this insertion sequence was not found in the 11 wild-type, gentamicin-susceptible gbs strains studied.

TI  == [severe orbital cellulitis: therapeutic results in 9 patients and review of the literature].
AB  == background: orbital cellulitis can produce severe neuromeningeal infections. modern antimicrobial agents such as imipenem can be a valid therapeutical choice. methods: patients with severe or complicated orbital cellulitis admitted to our hospital from 1986 through 1994 were retrospectively studied. results: nine patients with severe orbital cellulitis, seven of them older than 14 years, are reported. cellulitis was secondary to different forms of sinusitis in five of them. the incriminated microorganisms were: streptococcus viridans alone or combined to gram negative bacilli (3 cases), prevotella melaninogenica and other  anaerobes (2 cases), enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus (one case each). three patients developed brain abscesses, one an acute bacterial meningitis and another a subdural empyema. eight patients underwent a surgical drainage. seven patients were treated with iv imipenem at doses of 2-3 g/day with complete cure of the orbital cellulitis and of the associated infectious complications and no secondary effects. two patients died. conclusions: imipenem  is an effective antibiotic in the combined medical-surgical treatment of the severe or complicated orbital cellulitis.

TI  == in vitro activities of u-100592 and u-100766, novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agents.
AB  == oxazolidinones make up a relatively new class of antimicrobial agents which possess a unique mechanism of bacterial protein synthesis inhibition. u-100592 (s)-n-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-[4-(hydroxyacetyl)-1-piperazinyl]- phenyl]-2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]-acetamide and u-100766 (s)-n-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-(4-morpholinyl)phenyl]- 2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]-acetamide are novel oxazolidinone analogs from a directed chemical modification program. mics were determined for a variety of bacterial clinical isolates; the respective mics of u-100592 and u-100766 at which 90% of isolates are inhibited were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; methicillin-resistant s. aureus, 4  and 4 micrograms/ml; methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis, 2 and 2  micrograms/ml; methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis, 1 and 2 micrograms/ml; enterococcus faecalis, 2 and 4 micrograms/ml; enterococcus faecium, 2 and 4 micrograms/ml; streptococcus pyogenes, 1 and 2 micrograms/ml; streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.50 and 1 microgram/ml; corynebacterium spp., 0.50 and 0.50 micrograms/ml; moraxella catarrhalis, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; listeria monocytogenes, 8 and 2 micrograms/ml; and bacteroides fragilis, 16 and 4 micrograms/ml. most strains of mycobacterium tuberculosis and the gram-positive anaerobes were inhibited in the range of 0.50 to 2 micrograms/ml. enterococcal strains resistant to vancomycin (vana, vanb, and vanc resistance phenotypes), pneumococcal strains resistant to penicillin, and m. tuberculosis strains resistant to common antitubercular agents (isoniazid, streptomycin, rifampin, ethionamide, and ethambutol) were not cross-resistant to the oxazolidinones. the  presence of 10, 20, and 40% pooled human serum did not affect the antibacterial activities of the oxazolidinones. time-kill studies demonstrated a bacteriostatic effect of the analogs against staphylococci and enterococci but a bactericidal effect against streptococci. the spontaneous mutation frequencies of s. aureus atcc 29213 were <3.8 x 10(-10) and <8 x 10(-11) for u-100592 and u-100766, respectively. serial transfer of three staphylococcal and two enterococcal strains on drug gradient plates produced no evidence of rapid resistance development. thus, these new oxazolidinone analogs demonstrated in vitro antibacterial activities against a variety of clinically important human pathogens.

TI  == [in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sulopenem, a new penem antibiotic].
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sulopenem, a new penem, were evaluated in comparison with imipenem (ipm), meropenem (mepm), ceftazidime (caz)  and flomoxef (fmox). sulopenem had broad and potent antibacterial spectra against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including enterococcus faecalis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, enterobacter spp. and citrobacter freundii. sulopenem showed concentration-dependent bactericidal activities against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. morphological observation using phase-contrast microscope revealed that sulopenem induced spherical cell formation with e. coli  and k. pneumoniae at lower concentrations and bacteriolysis at higher concentrations. therapeutic efficacies of sulopenem against systemic infections in mice were almost equal to those of imipenem against streptococcus pneumoniae.  while its therapeutic efficacies were superior to those of meropenem, ceftazidime and flomoxef against s. aureus and s. pneumoniae, they were inferior to those of  imipenem/cilastatin against s. aureus, k. pneumoniae and a. calcoaceticus.

AB  == eighty percent minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic80) of sulopenem against clinically isolated 12 to 80 strains of each of different bacteria were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa): 0.20 micrograms/ml, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa): 50 micrograms/ml, coagulase-negative staphylococci: 3.13 micrograms/ml, streptococcus pyogenes: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, streptococcus pneumoniae: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, beta-streptococci: 0.05 microgram/ml, enterococcus faecalis: 12.5 micrograms/ml,  enterococcus faecium: > 100 micrograms/ml, escherichia coli cs2(r+): 0.10 microgram/ml, klebsiella pneumoniae: 0.05 microgram/ml, proteus mirabilis: 0.10 microgram/ml, proteus vulgaris: 0.20 microgram/ml, morganella morganii: 0.39 micrograms/ml, providencia rettgeri: 3.13 micrograms/ml, citrobacter freundii: 0.20 microgram/ml, enterobacter cloacae: 0.39 microgram/ml, serratia marcescens:  1.56 micrograms/ml, pseudomonas aeruginosa: 50 micrograms/ml, pseudomonas cepacia: 3.13 micrograms/ml, xanthomonas maltophilia: > 100 micrograms/ml, acinetobacter calcoaceticus: 1.56 micrograms/ml, ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae: 0.39 microgram/ml and bacteroides fragil is: 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively. sulopenem possesses a stronger activity than flomoxef or cefuzonam  against gram-positive bacteria, the strongest activity among the antibiotics tested against gram-negative bacteria except p. aeruginosa. sulopenem has stronger affinities than imipenem to all fractions of pbps of s. aureus, e. coli, p. vulgaris, s. marcescens, even of p. aeruginosa. affinities of sulopenem to pbps-1 and -3 of s. aureus, pbp-2 of e. coli were much stronger than those of imipenem (ipm). sulopenem generally has small ki values to all types of beta-lactamases and also has stronger permanent inactivation effect to ia and iib types of beta-lactamases than ipm. no synergistic bactericidal activity of sulopenem was apparent with serum complement. however, synergism of sulopenem with macrophages was prominent in bactericidal activity. the cells of e. coli were well phagocytosed and rapidly digested by cultured macrophages in the presence of a higher than 1/8 mic of sulopenem. moreover, sulopenem was more stable than imipenem against swine and human dehydropeptidase-is. sulopenem is one of the antibiotics that do not induce the appearance of subclones resistant to the drug.

TI  == phosphorylation-induced torsion-angle strain in the active center of hpr, detected by nmr and restrained molecular dynamics refinement.
AB  == the structure of the phosphorylated form of the histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein hpr from escherichia coli has been solved by nmr and compared with that of unphosphorylated hpr. the structural changes that occur upon phosphorylation of his 15, monitored by changes in noe patterns, 3jnhh alpha-coupling constants, and chemical shifts, are limited to the region around the phosphorylation site. the his15 backbone torsion angles become strained upon  phosphorylation. the release of this strain during the phosphoryl-transfer to enzyme ii facilitates the transport of carbohydrates across the membrane. from an x-ray study of streptococcus faecalis hpr (jia z, vandonselaar m, quail jw, delbaere ltj, 1993, nature 361:94-97), it was proposed that the observed torsion-angle strain at residue 16 in unphosphorylated s. faecalis hpr has a role to play in the protein's phosphocarrier function. the model predicts that this strain is released upon phosphorylation. our observations on e. coli hpr in solution, which shows strain only after phosphorylation, and the fact that all other hprs studied thus far in their unphosphorylated forms show no strain either, led us to investigate the possibility that the crystal environment causes the strain in s. faecalis hpr. a 1-ns molecular dynamics simulation of s. faecalis hpr, under conditions that mimic the crystal environment, confirms the observations from the x-ray study, including the torsion-angle strain at residue  16. the strain disappeared, however, when s. faecalis hpr was simulated in a water environment, resulting in an active site configuration virtually the same as that observed in all other unphosphorylated hprs. this indicates that the torsion-angle strain at ala 16 in s. faecalis hpr is a result of crystal contacts or conditions and does not play a role in the phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle.

TI  == inducer expulsion and the occurrence of an hpr(ser-p)-activated sugar-phosphate phosphatase in enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == inducer expulsion, a phenomenon in which rapidly metabolizable sugars cause cytoplasmic dephosphorylation and efflux of pre-accumulated sugar-phosphates (sugar-p), has been documented for streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus bovis, and lactococcus lactis, but not for other gram-positive bacteria. using intact cells and membrane vesicles, we show that enterococcus faecalis exhibits both inducer exclusion and inducer expulsion, and that the latter phenomenon is dependent on the metabolite-activated atp-dependent hpr(ser) kinase that phosphorylates ser-46 in hpr of the phosphotransferase system. a small, heat-stable, membrane-associated, hpr(ser-p)-activated sugar-p phosphatase (pase  ii), previously identified only in lc. lactis, is shown to be present in extracts of enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes but not in those of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, or bacillis subtilis, organisms that do not exhibit the inducer expulsion phenomenon. further, lactobacillus brevis, an organism that exhibits inducer expulsion by a different mechanism, also apparently lacks pase ii. the results reveal that pase ii is present in those organisms that exhibit the coupled sugar-p hydrolysis/expulsion mechanism but not those that lack this mechanism. they provide correlative evidence that pase ii initiates inducer expulsion in species of enterococci, streptococci and lactococci.

AB  == a 2.8-kb cryptic plasmid showing no homology to either pfx3 (rolling circle, pe194-type) or pci305 (theta-type) lactococcal replicons was identified in lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris 2204. the plasmid, pwc1, was compatible with both pci3340 (a pci305 derivative) and pfx3 in l. lactis subsp. cremoris 2204. sequence analysis of pwc1 showed one major orf encoding a protein with a deduced  size of 316 amino acids (aa). database comparisons showed that the protein was distinct from the pfx- and pci-type replication proteins (less than 21% aa identity), but shared significant homology (up to 57% aa identity) with the replication proteins from a different group of rolling circle plasmids (pc194-type) commonly found in gram-positive bacteria. a pc194-type rolling circle plasmid has not been previously described in l. lactis. further sequence analysis showed a conserved double-stranded origin of replication in pwc1 preceded by a large (118-bp) direct repeat. the chloramphenicol-resistance gene from pc194 was inserted into a nonessential region of pwc1 to give pcp12. the host range of pcp12 included streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus, but not escherichia coli. both pcp12 and to a lesser extent pwc1 generated single-stranded dna (ssdna) in l. lactis. a possible single-stranded origin of replication was identified by sequence analysis of pwc1 and by comparing levels of ssdna produced by pcp12 deletion derivatives. the pwc1 replicon may be a useful addition to other replicons currently available for vector construction.

TI  == efficient insertional mutagenesis in lactococci and other gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == in lactococci, the study of chromosomal genes and their regulation is limited by  the lack of an efficient transposon mutagenesis system. we associated the insertion sequence iss1 with the thermosensitive replicon pg+ host to generate a  mutagenic tool that can be used even in poorly transformable strains. iss1 transposition is random in different lactococcal strains as well as in enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus thermophilus. high-frequency random insertion (of about 1%) obtained with this system in lactococcus lactis allows efficient mutagenesis, with typically one insertion per cell. after iss1 replicative transposition, the chromosome contains duplicated iss1 sequences flanking pg+ host. this structure allows cloning of the interrupted gene. in addition, efficient excision of the plasmid leaves a single iss1 copy at the mutated site, thus generating a stable mutant strain with no foreign markers. mutants obtained by this transposition system are food grade and can thus be used in fermentation processes.

TI  == role of the c terminus in antigen p1 surface localization in streptococcus mutans and two related cocci.
AB  == the c terminus of the major surface protein p1 from streptococcus mutans is composed of a hydrophilic domain, an lpntgv motif, a hydrophobic domain, and a charged tail. these features are shared by surface proteins from many gram-positive coccal bacteria. to investigate the role of the c-terminal domains  in antigen p1 surface localization, full-length and truncated p1 gene constructs, which were expressed on the shuttle vector pdl276, were transformed into the p1-negative mutant s. mutans sm3352, streptococcus gordonii dl-1, and enterococcus faecalis uv202. transformants were tested for expression of p1 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assaying and western blotting. the results showed that full-length p1 was expressed by transformants of all three bacteria and was  localized on the cell surface. a fusion protein composed of the staphylococcus aureus fibronectin binding protein c terminus and the p1 protein n terminus was found to surface localize in s. mutans. deletion of the entire c-terminal domains resulted in p1 being expressed in the culture supernatant. a p1 truncation, which carried only the hydrophilic domain at its c terminus, was found partially associated with the cell surface. this truncated p1 was readily removed from the  isolated cell wall by hot sodium dodecyl sulfate-mercaptoethanol extraction. in contrast, the full-length p1 remained associated with the isolated cell wall after similar treatment, suggesting covalent linkages between the full-length p1  and the cell wall. the results described above showed that antigen p1 was anchored to the cell wall by its c-terminal domains probably via covalent linkages with the cell wall. the results also support a universal mechanism involving the c-terminal domains for protein surface localization among this group of gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == molecular cloning and sequence analysis of the gene encoding the h2o-forming nadh oxidase from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == to discover the molecular properties of two distinct nadh oxidases, corresponding to h2o2-forming oxidase (nox-1) and h2o-forming oxidase (nox-2) induced in streptococcus mutans, for the first step we had cloned and sequenced the nox-1 gene encoding nox-1. in this paper, a nox-2 gene encoding nox-2 from s. mutans was cloned, and the nucleotides sequenced. the nox-2 gene comprises 1371 base-pairs, encoding a polypeptide of 457 amino acid residues. the deduced relative molecular mass (m(r) = 49919) agreed with the previous value obtained from the purified nox-2 protein. the nox-2 gene was expressed in escherichia coli using its own promoter. alignment of the nox-2 protein sequence with that of the  nox-1 showed that the proteins do not significantly resemble each other. comparisons with the nadh oxidase from streptococcus faecalis 10c1 yield identities of 41%. the redox-active cysteine in the enzyme from s. faecalis was found to correspond to cys 44 in the nox-2.

TI  == bacteriological epidemiology and treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == one hundred symptomatic women with clinical bacterial vaginosis (bv) were enrolled in this study. the bacteriological epidemiology of bv and efficacy of oral or vaginal administration of antimicrobial agents for treatment of bv were investigated. the epidemiology of bv was investigated before antimicrobial therapy. fifty patients were treated with oral administration of metronidazole (mtn), 500 mg twice a day, and 50 patients with 2% clindamycin (cldm) phosphate in a vaginal cream, 5 g once a day for 7 days. the major organisms occurring were streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, gardnerella vaginalis, peptostreptococcus species, bacteroides species, prevotella species, and mobiluncus species and opportunistic pathogens such as staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis. the therapeutic efficacy of cldm cream on bv appeared  to be preferable to oral mtn from clinical and bacteriological aspects. the clinical and bacteriological effectiveness of mtn and cldm in the treatment of bv suggests that anaerobes might play a major role in causing the clinical symptoms  in patients with bv.

TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == identification and characterization of the genes of enterococcus faecalis plasmid pcf10 involved in replication and in negative control of pheromone-inducible conjugation.
AB  == the prgb gene of the enterococcus faecalis pheromone-inducible conjugative plasmid pcf10 encodes the surface protein asc10. this protein mediates cell aggregation and its expression results in high-frequency transfer of the plasmid  from donor to recipient. to identify the minimum region necessary for negative regulation of prgb expression, target plasmids were constructed containing a recently identified positive control region and a prgb::lacz transcriptional fusion; expression of prgb in cells carrying these plasmids was thus verified by  beta-galactosidase assay. the target plasmids were used in genetic studies with compatible plasmids containing cloned pcf10 genes supplying putative negative control functions to define the minimum region of pcf10 required for shutdown of  prgb expression in the absence of exogenous pheromone. the minimum segment required for negative control, as indentified by deletion analysis, was a 6.9-kb  region extending from the 5' end of a gene called prgn, through a previously identified gene, prgx. the dna in this region, which had not been previously characterized (2.85 kb), was sequenced, and several potential regulatory genes and plasmid replication genes were identified. genetic analysis indicated that the prgn, -y, and -x genes are involved in negative control; prgw may also play a role in negative control, since it appeared to be required for expression of prgy. prgx, or a closely adjacent dna sequence, acted in cis. the region of pcf10 containing negative control genes was also shown to function as an autonomous replicon in e. faecalis.

TI  == conversion of oleic acid to 10-hydroxystearic acid by two species of ruminal bacteria.
AB  == bacteria able to convert oleic acid to 10-hydroxystearic acid were isolated from  the ovine rumen. the solid hydroxy fatty acid produced from bacterial fermentations containing oleic acid was recovered by filtration, extraction into  ether and crystallisation. the identity of the product was confirmed by hplc and  gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. one 10-hydroxystearic-acid-producing bacterial group was represented by two strains of an anaerobic gram-negative curved rod with tufts of flagella on the concave surface of the cell. the morphology and other characteristics enabled the strains to be tentatively identified as selenomonas ruminantium. another bacterium capable of the same transformation, represented by two strains of a facultatively anaerobic gram positive chain-forming coccus, was identified as enterococcus faecalis. since unsaturated fatty acids entering the rumen are normally hydrogenated, hydration of oleic acid represents an alternative fate of unknown significance in vivo.

TI  == immunoblotting in the diagnosis of culture negative endocarditis caused by streptococci and enterococci.
AB  == aim: to improve the diagnosis of culture negative endocarditis by diagnosing cases due to streptococci and enterococci. methods: serum samples were immunoblotted against extracts of the commonest streptococci and enterococci. they were selected from patients with a cardiac murmur, persistent pyrexia and at least three negative blood cultures. the presence of patterns of endocarditis species specific antigenic bands was measured and correlated with clinical outcome. results: negative serology was found in 28 patients where the diagnosis  of endocarditis was rejected or, if proved, staphylococcal, yeast, gram negative, systemic lupus erythematosus, due to q fever or chlamydia psittaci or nonbacterial thrombotic. positive serology was found in 27 of the 34 patients where the response to antibiotics suggested streptococcal or enterococcal infection. in 22 of these there was objective evidence of endocarditis. positive  serology was also found in three of four further patients with vegetations at necropsy. conclusion: the identification of patterns of antibody response on immunoblotting can be used to make a specific diagnosis of streptococcal or enterococcal endocarditis in the absence of positive blood cultures.

AB  == isolated pathogenic bacteria from sputum of the patients with pulmonary emphysema who were admitted in our hospital from 1984 to 1994 were examined to elucidate the relationship between isolated bacteria from sputum and pulmonary functions including vital capacity (vc), forced expiratory volume (fev1.0), pao2 and paco2. vc of the patients from whom mssa (methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus) or enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis) were isolated was significantly lower than that of the patients from whom streptococcus pneumoniae (s. pneumoniae), branhamella catarrhalis (b. catarrhalis) or haemophilus influenza (h. influenza)  were isolated. fev1.0 had a similar tendency as vc in terms of isolated organisms from the patients with emphysema. similarly, po2 of the patients from whom mssa or e. cloacae were isolated was significantly lower than that of the patients from whom s. pneumoniae, b. catarrhalis or h. influenzae were isolated, and pco2  of the patients from whom s. pneumoniae, b. catarrhalis or h. influenza were isolated. there was also impaired respiratory function in the patients from whom  mssa, escherichia coli (e. coli), pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa), xanthomonas maltophilia (x. maltophilia) or enterobacter cloacae (e. cloacae) were isolated, compared with those in the patients from whom s. pneumonia, b. catarrhalis or h. influenzae were isolated. these results suggest that isolated pathogenic bacteria are shifted from s. pneumoniae, b. catarrhalis or h. influenza to mssa, e. coli, p. aeruginosa, x. maltophilia or e. cloacae in the course of impairment of respiratory function in pulmonary emphysema. the treatment and prophylaxis for acute exacerbation in pulmonary emphysema should be based on these results.

AB  == bacterial contamination of dentin may be a contributing factor in the development of bleaching-associated root resorption. in this study, the effect of commonly used bleaching agents on the permeability of dentin tubules to streptococcus faecalis was evaluated. sixty extracted bovine incisors were horizontally sectioned apically to the cementoenamel junction. in each tooth, a standard cavity was prepared, the pulp tissue extirpated, and remnants of soft tissue and  smear layer were removed. following rinsing and repeated autoclave sterilization, the teeth were divided into four groups, each treated with one of the following materials: 30% hydrogen peroxide, sodium perborate mixed with 30% hydrogen peroxide, sodium perborate mixed with distilled water, and distilled water alone  that served as control. the bleaching agents were sealed in the teeth and incubated at 37 degrees c for 7, 14, and 21 days. at each time interval the bleaching agents were removed and the teeth incubated at 37 degrees c in brain heart infusion infected with s. faecalis. histological sections were prepared, and the maximal bacterial penetration for each group was measured using a computerized morphometric system. statistical analysis of the results revealed that teeth treated with either 30% hydrogen peroxide alone or in combination with sodium perborate were significantly more permeable to s. faecalis than those treated with sodium perborate mixed with water (p < 0.0001). sodium perborate mixed with water did not cause an increase in dentin permeability to s. faecalis  and was similar to the water control. in conclusion, it seems that bleaching agents containing hydrogen peroxide in high concentrations may increase bacterial penetration through dentinal tubules.

TI  == pyogenic liver abscess: warning indicator of silent colonic cancer. report of a case and review of the literature.
AB  == purpose: carcinoma of the colon, manifested clinically as an enterococcal hepatic abscess, in the absence of liver metastases, is very uncommon. however, having treated a patient with such a condition, we would like to draw the attention of surgeons to this possibility. most reports describe secondary infections of hepatic metastases only in patients with a known malignancy. however, increased awareness of colonic cancer as an underlying cause of pyogenic liver abscesses will afford earlier diagnosis and treatment. methods: the case was analyzed for history, presentation, laboratory data, radiologic studies, and bacteriology. results: a 66-year-old woman presented with abdominal pain, fever, and chills. imaging scans revealed a solitary liver abscess, which was successfully treated with percutaneous drainage and broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics. pus cultures grew streptococcus faecalis. a search for the underlying cause led to the discovery of an adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon. conclusions: an aggressive search for the underlying cause of pyogenic liver abscesses should be  an integral part of the definitive treatment of this disease. after prevailing etiologies have been excluded, silent colonic cancer should be considered.

TI  == physical mapping of the conjugative bacteriocin plasmid ppd1 of enterococcus faecalis and identification of the determinant related to the pheromone response.
AB  == the pheromone-responding conjugative bacteriocin plasmid ppd1 (59 kb) of enterococcus faecalis was mapped physically by using a relational clone approach, and transposon analysis with tn917 (emr) or tn916 (tcr) facilitated the location  of the bacteriocin-related genes in a segment of about 6.7 kb. tn917 insertions within a 3-kb region resulted in constitutive clumping. the nucleotide sequence of the region that included the insertions giving rise to constitutive clumping was determined. the region of ppd1 spanned about 8 kb and was found to contain a  number of open reading frames, some of which were named on the basis of homologies with two other pheromone-responding plasmids, pad1 and pcf10. the genes were arranged in the sequence repb-repa-trac-trab-traa-ipd-trae-traf- orfy-sea-1 with all but repb and traa oriented in the same (left-to-right) direction. trac and trab corresponded, respectively, to trac and trab of pad1 and to prgy and prgz of pcf10.

TI  == cloning and characterization of a region of enterococcus faecalis plasmid ppd1 encoding pheromone inhibitor (ipd), pheromone sensitivity (trac), and pheromone shutdown (trab) genes.
AB  == bacteriocin plasmid ppd1 in enterococcus faecalis encodes a mating response to recipient-produced sex pheromone cpd1. once a recipient acquires ppd1, transconjugants apparently shut off cpd1 activity in broth culture and no longer  behave as recipients for ppd1. this event is performed by synthesis of the pheromone inhibitor ipd1 and also by repression of cpd1 production, the so-called "pheromone shutdown." a 5.4-kb ecorv-hincii segment of ppd1, which expressed ipd1 in escherichia coli, was sequenced and found to be organized as trac-trab-traa-ipd; each open reading frame is analogous to that found in other pheromone plasmids, pad1 and pcf10, and thus is designated in accordance with the nomenclature in pad1. the ipd gene encodes a peptide consisting of 21 amino acids, in which the c-terminal eight residues correspond to ipd1. the putative trac product has a strong similarity to oligopeptide-binding proteins found in other bacterial species, as do pheromone-binding proteins of pcf10 and pad1. a strain carrying trac-disrupted ppd1 required a concentration of cpd1 fourfold higher than that needed by the wild-type strain for induction of sexual aggregation. these results suggest that the trac product contributes to pheromone sensitivity as a pheromone-binding protein. a strain transformed with trab-disrupted ppd1 produced a high level of cpd1 similar to that produced by plasmid-free recipients and underwent self-induction. thus, the trab product contributes to cpd1 shutdown.

AB  == in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (lps; endotoxin), endothelial cells  are converted to an activation phenotype expressing both proinflammatory and procoagulant properties that include the induction of leukocyte adhesion molecules and tissue factor expression. lps-induced endothelial cell activation requires a soluble form of the monocyte lps receptor, scd14. we evaluated the capacity of multiple strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria to induce endothelial e-selectin and tissue factor expression through scd14-dependent pathways with cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huve). both viable and heat-killed gram-negative bacteria (bacteroides fragilis, enterobacter cloacae, haemophilus influenzae, and klebsiella pneumoniae) but not  viable or heat-killed gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae) induced prominent e-selectin surface expression detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. tissue factor activity  on huve, indicated by factor x activation, was induced in response to gram-negative bacteria but not in response to gram-positive bacteria. gram-negative bacteria induced transcriptional activation in huve, indicated by the appearance of e-selectin-specific mrna and by the demonstration of activation of nf-kappa b, a trans-activating factor necessary for e-selectin and tissue factor gene transcription. in contrast, neither e-selectin mrna nor activation of nf-kappa b was detected in huve treated with gram-positive bacteria. endothelial  cell activation by gram-negative bacteria in each of these assays was inhibited with a monoclonal antibody (60bd) against cd14. furthermore, cho-k1 cells, transfected with human recombinant cd14, responded to all strains of gram-negative bacteria (viable or heat killed), indicated by cho-k1 nf-kappa b activation. we conclude that gram-negative bacteria induce endothelial cell activation through a common scd14-dependent pathway.

TI  == microflora associated with percutaneous craniofacial implants used for the retention of facial prostheses: a pilot study.
AB  == craniofacial implants have been used successfully for the retention of facial prostheses. however, complications occur that can lead to the loss of implant integration. one such complication is infection possibly resulting from crevicular microflora activity. as part of an ongoing study, samples from crevicular sites surrounding 17 craniofacial implants were collected and submitted for microbiological assay. the results demonstrated the presence of opportunistic pathogens in many sites regardless of subjects' hygiene efforts. the significance of the findings is reviewed.

TI  == improved microbiological assay for folic acid based on microtiter plating with streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == we have developed an improved method, using 96-well microtiter plates, for the microbiological assay of folic acid. with this method, the tedium of conventional microbiological analysis is substantially decreased. culture volumes have been reduced 33-fold, and pipetting procedures have been simplified. assay time has been reduced to 14 h, and sensitivity has increased 10-fold (0.1 ng/ml). analytical recoveries range from 98 to 104%. intra-assay and interassay variabilities are less than 11%. the assay does not require extensive manipulation of inoculum. day-to-day variability has been minimized by using saline aliquots of the bacterial suspension stored at 4 degrees c. the procedure  is accurate, selective, and useful for direct measurement of folic acid in multivitamin formulations.

TI  == controlled evaluation of bact/alert standard anaerobic and fan anaerobic blood culture bottles for the detection of bacteremia and fungemia.
AB  == fan medium was formulated to improve microbial recovery, particularly for fastidious microorganisms and for microorganisms causing sepsis in patients receiving antimicrobial therapy. in a controlled clinical evaluation performed at four university-affiliated hospitals, fan anaerobic bottles were compared with standard anaerobic bottles for yield, speed of detection of microbial growth, and detection of septic episodes. a total of 10,431 blood culture sets were received; both anaerobic bottles of 7,694 blood culture sets were adequately filled with blood. altogether, 925 isolates were recovered: 557 that were the cause of sepsis, 99 that were indeterminate as the cause of sepsis, and 269 contaminants.  more staphylococcus aureus (p < 0.001), coagulase-negative staphylococci (p < 0.001), escherichia coli (p < 0.02), and all microorganisms combined (p < 0.005)  were recovered from fan bottles; more nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli (p <  0.05), torulopsis glabrata (p < 0.001), and other yeasts (p < 0.01) were recovered from standard bottles. growth of s. aureus (p < 0.001), coagulase-negative staphylococci (p < 0.001), enterococcus faecalis (p < 0.025),  streptococci other than streptococcus pneumoniae (p < 0.01), and all microorganisms combined (p < 0.001) was detected earlier in standard bottles; growth of more isolates of e. coli (p < 0.05) and anaerobic bacteria (p < 0.01) was detected earlier in fan bottles. the mean times to detection were 14.2 and 16.1 h for standard and fan bottles, respectively. more septic episodes caused by s. aureus (p < 0.001), coagulase-negative staphylococci (p < 0.005), members of the family enterobacteriaceae (p < 0.02), and all microorganisms combined (p < 0.02) were detected in fan bottles; more septic episodes caused by nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli (p < 0.025) and yeasts (p < 0.005) were detected in standard bottles. in summary, more isolates (except for strict aerobes) were recovered from fan bottles than from standard anaerobic bottles. similarly, significant more septic episodes (except for those caused by strict aerobes) were detected with fan bottles than with standard anaerobic bottles. with the exception of e. coli and anaerobic bacteria, growth of more isolates was detected earlier in standard anaerobic bottles.

TI  == characterization of superoxide dismutase genes from gram-positive bacteria by polymerase chain reaction using degenerate primers.
AB  == an internal fragment representing approximately 85% of sod genes from seven gram-positive bacteria was amplified by using degenerate primers in a polymerase  chain reaction assay. the dna sequences of sod polymerase chain reaction products from clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactococcus lactis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes were determined. comparisons of their deduced amino acid sequences with those of the corresponding regions of  the sod proteins from bacillus stearothermophilus, listeria monocytogenes, and streptococcus mutans revealed strong relatedness. phylogenetic analysis of sod peptides showed that members of the genera streptococcus and those of the genera  enterococcus constitute two well-supported monophyletic groups. the method described in this study provides a means for easy recovery of sod genes and the construction of sod mutants of various gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == streptococcal plasmid pip501 has a functional orit site.
AB  == dna sequence analysis suggested the presence of a plasmid transfer origin-like site (orit) in the gram-positive conjugative plasmid pip501. to test the hypothesis that the putative orit site in pip501 played a role in conjugal transfer, we conducted plasmid mobilization studies in enterococcus faecalis. two fragments, 49 and 309 bp, which encompassed the orit region of pip501, were cloned into pdl277, a nonconjugative plasmid of gram-positive origin. these recombinant plasmids were mobilized by pva1702, a derivative of pip501, at a frequency of 10(-4) to 10(-5) transconjugants per donor cell, while pdl277 was mobilized at a frequency of 10(-8) transconjugants per donor cell. these results  indicated that the orit-like site was needed for conjugal mobilization. to demonstrate precise nicking at the orit site, alkaline gel and dna-sequencing analyses were performed. alkaline gel electrophoresis results indicated a single-stranded dna break in the predicted orit site. the orit site was found upstream of six open reading frames (orf1 to orf6), each of which plays a role in conjugal transfer. taken together, our conjugal mobilization data and the in vivo orit nicking seen in escherichia coli argue compellingly for the role of specific, single-stranded cleavage in plasmid mobilization. thus, plasmid mobilization promoted by pva1702 (pip501) works in a fashion similar to that known to occur widely in gram-negative bacteria.

AB  == lactobacillus gg, a recently characterized l. rhamnosus gg strain (atcc 53103), has been shown to exert inhibitory activity against a variety of bacterial species, including streptococci. we isolated and studied the effect of the inhibitory substance of lactobacillus gg on some oral streptococci. the inhibitory activity of the isolated substance was weak, but some growth inhibition was observed in streptococcus sobrinus pretreated with the substance in comparison with untreated controls. zones of growth inhibition on agar plates  were apparent only at ph values below 5, indicating that the inhibitory activity  was restricted to a low ph range. growth curve experiments showed a statistically significant inhibition between series with and without the isolated substance (p  < 0.05). the ultrastructure of s. sobrinus was not affected when treated with the inhibitory substance. the lactobacillus gg itself did not ferment sucrose. the results offer interesting perspectives for future research focusing on the protective function of normal flora and in the attempt to replace harmful bacterial species in oral microflora with less harmful ones.

AB  == the clostridium perfringens macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin b resistance gene, ermbp, was sequenced and shown to be identical to the ermb-ermam gene from  the promiscuous enterococcus faecalis plasmid pam beta 1 and to have at least 98% nucleotide sequence identity to other ermb-ermam genes. flanking the ermbp structural gene were almost identical directly repeated 1,341-bp sequences (dr1 and dr2). these repeats potentially encoded a 298 (or 284)-amino-acid protein that had sequence similarity to chromosomal and plasmid partitioning proteins. the pam beta 1 and streptococcus agalactiae (pip501) erm determinants appeared to have dr2 but had similar internal 973- or 956-bp deletions in dr1, respectively.  some of the other ermb-ermam class determinants had small portions of dr1, but none had complete copies. it is postulated that the c. perfringens ermbp determinant was derived from an enterococcal or streptococcal determinant that had complete copies of both dr1 and dr2.

TI  == synthesis and antibacterial activity of some novel 1-substituted 1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7-pyridinyl-3-quinolinecarboxylic acids. potent antistaphylococcal agents.
AB  == the palladium-catalyzed coupling of 3- and 4-(trialkylstannyl)pyridines with 7-bromo or 7-chloro 1-substituted 1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylates has provided access to the corresponding 1-substituted 1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7-pyridinyl-3-quinolinecarboxylic acids. the antibacterial activity of these derivatives was studied with the finding that the optimal 1- and 7-position substituents for gram positive activity are cyclopropyl and 4-(2,6-dimethylpyridinyl), respectively. we find that for the fluorine-substituted derivatives studied, the position of the fluorine on the quinolone nucleus or the number of fluorine atoms does not seem to be important for good gram positive activity. for 1-cyclopropyl 7-(2,6-dimethyl-4-pyridinyl) derivatives, the 6-fluoro 4a, 8-fluoro 10d, 6,8-difluoro 10b, and 5,6,8-trifluoro 8, all provided equal antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213. there is also a correlation between the substitution on the 7-(4-pyridinyl) group and the gram positive activity, particularly for s. aureus, clearly indicating that the 2,6-dimethylpyridinyl group is optimal. the mic50 value for the most potent agents in this study against s. aureus atcc 29213 is 0.008 microgram/ml. by comparison, ciprofloxacin and aminopyrrolidine 28 gave values of 0.25 and 0.015 microgram/ml, respectively, against this organism.

TI  == quinone reductase reaction catalyzed by streptococcus faecalis nadh peroxidase.
AB  == nadh peroxidase is a flavoenzyme having a single redox-active thiol, cys42, that  cycles between sulfenate and thiol forms in the nadh-dependent reduction of hydrogen peroxide. nadh peroxidase catalyzes the nadh-dependent reduction of quinones with turnover numbers between 1.2 and 3.9 s-1, per mole of fad, at ph 7.5. the bimolecular rate constants for quinone reduction, v/k, ranged from 4.3 x 10(3) to 6.0 x 10(5) m-1 s-1 for 14 quinones whose redox potentials varied between -0.41 and 0.09 v. the logarithms of the v/k values for these quinones are hyperbolically dependent on their single-electron reduction potentials (e7(1). one-electron reduction of benzoquinone accounts for about 50% of the total electron transfer catalyzed by nadh peroxidase at ph 7, with the remainder of the reduction being catalyzed by a two-electron (hydride) transfer. cys42 can be irreversibly oxidized to the sulfonate by hydrogen peroxide, with inactivation of the peroxidatic activity of the enzyme. the residual quinone reductase activity of nadh peroxidase which has undergone oxidative inactivation of the active site  cys42 indicates that this residue is not involved in the reduction of the quinones. product inhibition studies suggest the possibility of overlap of the pyridine nucleotide and quinone binding sites in the reduced enzyme at low ph values. the ph dependence of the maximum velocity of naphthoquinone reduction shows that deprotonation of an enzymic group, exhibiting a pk value of ca. 6.2, decreases the maximal velocity. primary deuterium kinetic isotope effects on v and v/k for quinone-dependent nadh oxidation increase upon protonation of a group, exhibiting a pk value of 6.4.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

(b.)  catarrhalis, h. influenzae, and almost all of enterobacteriaceae were stronger than those of ampicillin (abpc) and piperacillin (pipc), but antimicrobial activities of sbt/abpc were weak against mrsa and cephems (ceps)-resistant strains detected in some of enterobacteriaceae. 3. it appeared that benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive streptococcus pneumoniae (pisp) or pcg-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) and ceps-resistant escherichia coli increased  year by year. 4. antimicrobial activities of sbt/abpc were strong against streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, m. (b.) catarrhalis and h. influenzae including beta-lactamase producing strains. additionally, beta-lactamase inhibiting effect of sbt was observed against beta-lactamase produced by s. aureus and k. pneumoniae which demonstrate indirect pathogenicity. thus, sbt/abpc is an injectable antibiotic that is expected to demonstrate clinical usefulness,  especially as the first line drug for the respiratory tract infections that are community-acquired.

AB  == the direct viable count (dvc) is a procedure for enumerating viable-nonculturable cells. it should be noted, however, that bacteria demonstrating the viable but nonculturable phase have to date included only gram-negative species, mainly because the dvc procedure does not lend itself to the analysis of gram-positive bacteria since the dvc procedure is dependent on the bacterium being sensitive to nalidixic acid. the authors report here concerning studies on an analogous procedure for the direct enumeration of viable-nonculturable gram-positive bacteria. to facilitate a differential dvc for gram-positive bacteria, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin or isopropyl cinodine were substituted for nalidixic acid. these antibiotics were chosen because, like nalidixic acid, they  are dna gyrase inhibitors. the concentrations used for each antibiotic were 1000  micrograms ml-1, 100 micrograms ml-1. pure cultures of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, listeria monocytogenes and bacillus subtilis were obtained from the culture collection at the university of  wyoming and a faecal streptococcus was isolated from the laramie wastewater treatment plant. an antibiotic and optimal concentration thereof was found which  gave enlarged cells for all the organisms except the faecal streptococcus isolated from the wastewater plant for which no enlarged cells were ever seen. the antibiotic and concentration thereof which gave the optimal percent enlarged  cells in the dvc procedure varied between organisms.

TI  == [the isolation of streptococcus morbillorum from vaginal exudates].
AB  == we have tested 195 vaginal secretions sent by gynecology service of this hospital between the years 1988-1990. we achieved positive culture for streptococci in 58  (30%) of these cultures, 26 (44.8%) corresponding to streptococcus morbillorum 9  (15.5%), to gardnerella vaginalis 5 (8.6%), to enterococcus faecalis-durans and to streptococcus agalactiae, 3 (5.1%) to streptococcus mitis and milleri 2 (3.4%), to streptococcus bovis and cremoris, and 1 (1.7%) to streptococcus salivarius, equinus and sanguis ii respectively. we previously found that 52.8% of these patients were positive for vaginal candidiasis. the bacteriological identification done by the api 20 strep system (biomerieux gmbh, nutingen, germany) provides a typical pattern ("good identification") for the streptococcus morbillorum.

TI  == molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding the major peptidoglycan hydrolase of lactococcus lactis, a muramidase needed for cell separation.
AB  == a gene of lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris mg1363 encoding a peptidoglycan hydrolase was identified in a genomic library of the strain in puc19 by screening escherichia coli transformants for cell wall lysis activity on a medium containing autoclaved, lyophilized micrococcus lysodeikticus cells. in cell extracts of l. lactis mg1363 and several halo-producing e. coli transformants, lytic bands of similar sizes were identified by denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds)-polyacrylamide gels containing l. lactis or m. lysodeikticus cell walls. of these clearing bands, corresponding to the presence of lytic enzymes with sizes of 46 and 41 kda, the 41-kda band was also present in the supernatant of an l. lactis culture. deletion analysis of one of the recombinant plasmids showed that  the information specifying lytic activity was contained within a 2,428-bp ecorv-sau3a fragment. sequencing of part of this fragment revealed a gene (acma)  that could encode a polypeptide of 437 amino acid residues. the calculated molecular mass of acma (46,564 da) corresponded to that of one of the lytic activities detected. presumably, the enzyme is synthesized as a precursor protein which is processed by cleavage after the ala at position 57, thus producing a mature protein with a size of 40,264 da, which would correspond to the size of the enzyme whose lytic activity was present in culture supernatants of l. lactis. the n-terminal region of the mature protein showed 60% identity with the n-terminal region of the mature muramidase-2 of enterococcus hirae and the autolysin of streptococcus faecalis. like the latter two enzymes, acma contains c-terminal repeated regions. in acma, these three repeats are separated by nonhomologous intervening sequences highly enriched in serine, threonine, and asparagine. genes specifying identical activities were detected in various strains of l. lactis subsp. lactis and l. lactis subsp. cremoris by the sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis detection assay and pcr experiments. by replacement recombination, an acma deletion mutant which grew as long chains was  constructed, indicating that acma is required for cell separation.

TI  == [nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents in 1991].
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  different antibacterial agents at 123 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1991. in this study, identifications and susceptibility  testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. the susceptibility testing were performed using the disk dilution method recommended by nccls. staphylococcus aureus and cns showed high or moderate resistance rates to methicillin (dmppc). streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, proteus mirabilis were highly susceptible to  many agents including beta-lactam antibiotics. though enterococcus faecalis was highly susceptible to ampicillin (abpc), piperacillin (pipc), imipenem (ipm), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (st) compounds, enterococcus faecium was resistant  to almost all antibacterial agents but to st compounds. high susceptibility rates were observed for strains of enterobacter cloacae to ipm, gentamicin (gm) and ofloxacin (oflx) and for strains of proteus vulgaris to latamoxef (lmox), ipm, aztreonam (azt), gm and oflx. serratia marcescens and bacteroides fragilis group  were highly susceptible only to ipm. pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to ceftazidime (caz), ipm, amikacin (amk) and tobramycin (tob). pseudomonas cepacia  was relatively susceptible only to caz. ipm showed strong antibacterial activity  to many species except for s. aureus and cns.

AB  == six widely used x-ray contrast media (xrc) were tested against nine commonly isolated organisms to determine the practicality of using xrc to outline body spaces prior to obtaining specimens for culture and to assess the feasibility of  using xrc in divided doses to reduce cost. preparations of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus milleri in two approximate concentrations of 10(4) and 10(8) colony forming units/ml (cfu/ml) were inoculated into the following xrc: conray 280, hexabrix 320, lopamiro 370, omnipaque 350, ultravist 300 and optiray 320 each in two concentrations. sampling was performed in triplicate at 0, 2, 4 and 20 h with the 20 h counts made after exposure at both 22 degrees c and 4 degrees c. there were 16 significant interactions, predominantly with the gram-negative organisms. conray 280 produced the greatest number of effects. most effects were bacteriostatic. organisms were  most susceptible at low concentration and after prolonged contact with xrc. no effect was seen with dilute xrc. all weekly sterility checks were negative. non-ionic xrc have no significant effect on the growth of gram-positive organisms and little effect on gram-negative organisms if processing is performed promptly. using standard aseptic technique, no contamination of xrc occurred, suggesting multi-dosing may be a safe and cost-effective method of xrc utilization.

AB  == mechanisms of resistance of strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, neisseria meningitidis and mycobacterium tuberculosis to antibiotics are presented and discussed. the resistance to methicillin-oxacillin in s. aureus and s. epidermidis is chromosomally-mediated by sequence of dna, namely by gene meca. this gene codes altered pbp-2a protein. strains of s.pneumoniae contain pbp-1a, pbp-2b and pbp-2x proteins. they cause resistance to many beta-lactam antibiotics. resistance to vankomycin, respectively to teikoplanin in strains of  e. faecalis and e. faecium is coded by transferable vana and vanb genes. strains  of n. meningitidis produce mostly the altered pbp-2 protein. the increase of resistance in strains of m. tuberculosis is also significant.

TI  == growth conditions influence expression of cell surface hydrophobicity of staphylococci and other wound infection pathogens.
AB  == the initial adhesion of microbes to tissue and solid surfaces can be mediated by  hydrophobic interaction. expression of microbial cell surface hydrophobicity (csh) is influenced by growth conditions, and often best expressed after growth under nutrient-poor conditions, or "starvation". in the present study, the csh of 133 strains of enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, group a streptococcus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, peptococcus magnus, and of 8 candida albicans strains was measured by the salt aggregation test after growth on hematin agar in a 5% co2 atmosphere, or under anaerobiosis. cells of all but 8 strains expressed pronounced or moderate csh, i.e., they aggregated in  0.01-2 m ammonium sulfate. when the agar surface was covered by human serum (diluted 1:5) to mimic growth conditions in a wound, 94 strains expressed higher  csh, and 44 strains the same csh as after growth without serum. the csh of 12 strains of different species was measured after growth on blood, hematin and pdm  agar, with or without serum, and in an aerobic or a 5% co2 atmosphere. the highest csh was expressed after growth in 5% co2 with serum, and the lowest growth after on blood agar in aerobic atmosphere. identical results were obtained with native and heat-inactivated (56 c, 20 min) serum. the reduced surface tension obtained in 5% co2, as well as yet unidentified serum factors, promotes expression of csh.

AB  == three erythromyxin-resistant swedish isolates of streptococcus pyogenes, representing different t-types, were studied. two of the strains showed constitutive high-level (mic > 200 micrograms/ml) and one showed moderate (mic 6.4 micrograms/ml) resistance; the latter strain was sensitive to lincosamide and clindamycin, and resistance was not induced by erythromycin. in each of the strains, a plasmid with an estimated mw of 17.6 +/- 0.9 x 10(6) was isolated in addition to smaller cryptic plasmids. the three plasmids pse701, pse702, and pse703 had very similar restriction enzyme cleavage patterns. novobiocin curing of the high-level resistance strain er559 showed the resistance to be linked to its 17.6 x 10(6) plasmid, pse703. furthermore, by electroporation this rather large plasmid was reintroduced into an erythromycin-sensitive cured derivative, acquiring resistance, and the plasmid was again recovered from the transconjugant. one of the plasmids, pse702, was shown by filter mating to be conjugative within s. pyogenes. dna-dna hybridization showed that the resistance  determinant of the present three isolates was related to the erm gene on plasmid  pam beta 1 of enterococcus faecalis but not to that of plasmid pe194 of staphylococcus aureus. the copy numbers of pse702 and pse703, derived from the two high-level resistant strains, were 11 +/- 3 and 17 +/- 5 compared to 2 +/- 1  for pse701, derived from the moderately resistant strain, possibly accounting for the phenotypic variation observed. the plasmids pse702 and pam beta 1 showed about 80% homology in dna-dna hybridization tests and high similarity in their restriction maps.

TI  == positive inotropic effect of streptococcus faecalis in isolated cardiac muscle.
AB  == infective endocarditis is caused by bacterial colonization of the endocardium. because endocardium modulates mechanical performance of subjacent myocardium, we  studied acute effects of bacteria on isolated cardiac muscle and on the functional role of the endocardium. bacteria, grown in broth at 37 degrees c, were added at increasing concentrations (10(2) to 10(6) bacteria/ml) to cat papillary muscles in krebs-ringer solution (1.25 mm ca2+, 35 degrees c). the endocardial surface was damaged by exposing muscles to a stream of dry air for 30 s. streptococcus (enterococcus) faecalis induced significant increases in total peak isometric twitch tension (tt) and maximal velocity of unloaded shortening (vmax) and significant decreases in time to tt (tttt) and time to half isometric  twitch tension decline (rt 1/2), both before and after removal of endocardial endothelium. this response could also be elicited with bacterial filtrate, after  boiling the filtrate or after extracting the polysaccharides from it with kio4. increasing ca2+ concentrations progressively reduced the response to the filtrate. propranolol slightly, although not significantly, diminished the effects on tt and vmax while abolishing the effects on tttt and on rt 1/2. by contrast, streptococcus bovis and staphylococcus aureus did not affect tt or vmax but induced a slight but significant decrease in tttt at the highest concentration of bacteria. accordingly, the filtrate of strep. faecalis induces a positive inotropic effect. the active component is neither a protein nor a polysaccharide, and its effect may be partly beta-adrenoceptor mediated. strep. bovis and staph. aureus have negligible acute effects on contractility.

AB  == erythromycin-resistant derivatives of the pheromone-responsive plasmid pip964 from enterococcus faecalis were constructed to study its host range. this was done by inserting the integrative vector pat112 and the related replicon ptcr1 harboring orir of the broad host range plasmid pam beta 1 into the hemolysin-bacteriocin operon of pip964, to give ptcr2 and ptcr3, respectively. plasmid ptcr2 was transferred by filter matings from e. faecalis to enterococcus  faecium and listeria monocytogenes at frequencies of 2 x 10(-7) and 5 x 10(-7) per donor, respectively, in the apparent absence of pheromone induction and cellular aggregation. in these hosts, ptcr2 remained intact as a self-replicating element and maintained its transfer capabilities. plasmid ptcr3, but not ptcr2, was transferred at similar frequencies from e. faecalis to lactococcus lactis and streptococcus agalactiae. thus, the transfer system of pip964 possesses a broader host-range than its replication system.

TI  == resistant gram-positive organisms.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance in gram-positive bacteria has reemerged in the last decade as a major clinical problem. methicillin-resistant staphylococci, penicillin-resistant pneumococci, and enterococci resistant to penicillin, vancomycin, and/or gentamicin have become new considerations in the selection of  therapy. both mutation and acquisition of new dna on either the chromosome or plasmids can be responsible for resistance in gram-positive species. because therapies are often limited, renewed efforts are needed to understand the epidemiology in order to effect control.

TI  == n,n-dimethylglycyl-amido derivative of minocycline and 6-demethyl-6-desoxytetracycline, two new glycylcyclines highly effective against  tetracycline-resistant gram-positive cocci.
AB  == the in vitro activities of the n,n-dimethylglycyl-amino derivative of minocycline (dmg-mino) and 6-dimethyl-6-dexoxytetracycline (dmg-dmdot), members of a new generation of tetracyclines, were evaluated by an agar dilution method and were compared with those of tetracycline and minocycline against 224 tetracycline-resistant and 73 tetracycline-susceptible recent clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci, including multiple-antibiotic-resistant methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the mics of dmg-mino and dmg-dmdot were up to 500- to 2,000-fold lower than those of tetracycline against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic for 50% of strains tested [mic50], < 0.06 microgram/ml). against streptococcus groups a, b, c, and g and enterococcus  faecalis, the mic50 was 0.5 microgram/ml. mic50s were greater only for coagulase-negative staphylococci (2 micrograms/ml). these data indicate that dmg-mino and dmg-dmdot are very potent drugs, and further in vitro and in vivo studies are warranted.

TI  == childhood bacteremia in israel: causes, age relation, predisposing factors and source.
AB  == to delineate the spectrum of childhood bacteremia in a tertiary medical center in israel and to define the historical, clinical and environmental variables that affect it, 339 bacteremic episodes were studied. ten of the episodes (3%) were polymicrobial and 148 (44%) were hospital acquired. staphylococcus epidermidis (17%), staph. aureus (10%), gram-negative bacilli and haemophilus influenzae (7%) were the most frequent etiologic pathogens. some organisms (e.g., h. influenzae,  streptococcus pneumoniae) caused mainly community-acquired bacteremia, while klebsiella sp., enterococcus faecalis, and acinetobacter sp. caused mainly nosocomial bacteremia. underlying conditions were noted in 72% of the bacteremic  children. a source of the bacteremia was identified in 60% of the episodes; the most common was i.v.-line infection. age, underlying condition, source and location in the hospital markedly affected the profile of microorganisms causing  childhood bacteremia. each of these variables defined 3-5 organisms that were most prominent. in each episode of suspected bacteremia, these variables should be considered, thus defining the most likely causative pathogen(s), which should  be covered by appropriate empiric antimicrobial treatment.

AB  == the in vitro activity of cp-99,219 was compared with that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 814 clinical bacterial isolates using a microdilution method with brain-heart infusion broth. cp-99,219 was the most potent agent tested against methicillin-resistant, ciprofloxacin-susceptible staphylocci (minimum inhibitory concentration [mic]90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). cp-99,219 was 32-fold and fourfold more potent than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, respectively, against streptococcus pneumoniae, including strains resistant to penicillin g and erythromycin (mic90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). cp-99,219 was also the most potent agent tested against s. pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis (mic90 < or = 0.5 microgram/ml). the activity of cp-99,219 against enterobacteriaceae was comparable to that of sparfloxacin, with 90% of escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, c.  diversus, helicobacter pylori, and k. oxytoca being inhibited by < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were less susceptible, with mic90 values to cp-99,219 of 4, 2, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 for bacteroides fragilis was 0.39 microgram/ml for cp-99,219 compared with 12.5 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. cp-99,219 was highly bactericidal at 1 x to 4 x mic against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms; its activity was similar in nutrient, trypticase soy, and cation-supplemented mueller-hinton broths. the spectrum and potency observed with cp-99,219 warrant further testing with this novel quinolone.

TI  == [method of dna extraction and meca, fema and pbp2' in multi-drug resistant bacterial strains].
AB  == recently, it has become more important to establish rapid and reliable methods for identifying bacterial species and their drug resistances because of the high  incidence of nosocomial infection caused by multi-drug resistant bacteria. at first, several enzymes were tested to evaluate the efficacy of dna extraction. n-acetylmuramidase, lysozyme and achromopeptidase were most effective to extract  dna from e. faecalis, e. faecium and s. aureus, respectively. after achromopeptidase extraction, the meca gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) in clinically isolated mrsa (95 strains), mssa (66), mrse (methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis, 37), msse (methicillin-sensitive s. epidermidis, 1), s haemolyticus(5), s.hominis(1) and others (enterococcus, pseudomonas, and streptococcus, total 45). pcr products were analyzed by agarose  gel electrophoresis. the positive rates were 95% (mrsa), 1.5% (mssa), and 97% (mrse). the meca gene was also positive in 2/2 of methicillin-resistant s.haemolyticus and 2/3 of methicillin-sensitive s.haemolyticus and 1/1 of methicillin-resistant s.hominis. the meca gene was not detected in 45 non-staphylococcal strains. meca and fema gene by pcr and pbp 2' by irma were further detected in newly isolated mrsa (20 strains), mssa(20), mrse(14), msse(1) and s.simulans(2). complete correlation between mpipc susceptibility and meca were found. the fema gene was positive in 39/40 of s. aureus, and 0/14 of s.epidermidis, 2/3 of s.simulans. pbp2' were positive in 20/20 of mrsa, 0/20 of mssa, 14/14 of mrse, 0/1 of msse, 1/1 of methicillin-resistant s.simulans, and 0/2 of methicillin-sensitive s.simulans. in conclusion, diagnoses of mrsa by simultaneous detection of meca and fema gene as well as pbp2' are similarly useful because of their specificity and rapidity.

TI  == isolation and identification by gas chromatographic mass spectrometry of the carbonyl-active site of pig kidney diamine oxidase.
AB  == an adduct with phenylhydrazine was formed with the purified pig kidney diamine oxidase and in parallel with the l-tyrosine decarboxylase from streptococcus faecalis. the labeled enzymes were hydrolyzed by chemical hydrolysis and the adducts released by hydrolysis were isolated and identified first in hplc and successively in gc-ms. both enzymes gave the same adduct which was identified as  the phenylhydrazone of pyridoxal. the isolated adduct had the same retention time as the phenylhydrazone of pyridoxal in hplc and in gas chromatography and showed  the same molecular weight in mass spectrometry when chemical ionization was used  and the same fragmentation in mass spectrometry when electronic impact was used.  the reported results show that pig kidney diamine oxidase contains pyridoxal in the form of covalently linked pyridoxal phosphate which can be released from the  enzyme only by chemical hydrolysis. pig kidney diamine oxidase is therefore a pyridoxal enzyme such as l-tyrosine decarboxylase as hypothesized in the past but never clearly demonstrated.

AB  == streptococcus suis was the most frequent streptococcus spp. in pig tonsils, followed by the beta-haemolytic porcine 'equisimilis' ecovar of strep. dysgalactiae. the intestinal streptococcal flora was composed of strep. bovis, strep. hyointestinalis and strep. suis. many of these intestinal strep. suis belonged to a beta-glucuronidase-negative biotype which is infrequent in lesions. nearly half of the strains presumptively identified as strep. alactolyticus produced acid from lactose. this species was not found in tonsils and intestines  but was about equally prevalent as strep. hyointestinalis in pig faeces and rectal swabs. other streptococci were rare in this material. enterococci were much less frequently identified than streptococci in tonsils and faeces. in intestinal samples enterococcus faecalis, ent. faecium, ent. hirae and ent. cecorum were most frequently found. in faeces ent. faecium was the most prevalent enterococcus. the characteristics of the less well known species strep. alactolyticus and strep. hyointestinalis are described in detail, and guidelines  for their differentiation from strep. bovis and strep. suis given.

TI  == structural comparison of the histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein hpr.
AB  == the phosphocarrier protein hpr is a central component of the bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (pts) that is responsible for carbohydrate uptake in many bacterial species. a number of three-dimensional structures of hprs from both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria have been determined; the overall folding topology of hpr is an open-faced beta-sandwich composed of three alpha-helices and a beta-sheet. a detailed structural comparison of these hprs has been carried out. besides the overall main chain folding, many detailed structural features are well conserved in all hpr structures. the three x-ray structures of hprs from escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, and bacillus subtilis show considerable overall similarity with respect to the positions of the c alpha atoms. a significant structural difference between hprs from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria  is found in the region of gly54, owing to the steric effects of tyr37 in hprs from the gram-positive species. the region around gly54 is involved in the binding of hpr to other pts proteins and the differences in this region may be responsible for some of the poor functional complementation between hprs from gram-positive and gram-negative species. the active center region, residues 12-18, appears to have significant differences in the comparisons between the overall structures. these differences support the proposal that phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the active site his15 is accompanied by conformational changes. however, a local structural comparison of residues 12-18 from the x-ray  structures of hprs from e. coli and b. subtilis, and the two-dimensional nuclear  magnetic resonance structure of b. subtilis hpr suggests that there is a conserved active center involving residues his15, arg 17, and pro18, which shows  little conformational change during the phosphorylation cycle. the results of other experimental approaches, including site-directed mutagenesis and nmr spectroscopy, are in some cases difficult to rationalize with some of the details of the structures, but do appear to favour the conclusion that little conformational change occurs.

AB  == the extracellular metalloendopeptidase (ec 3.4.24.30; coccolysin) from enterococcus faecalis (strain og1-10) inactivates human endothelin-1 by hydrolyzing the peptide primarily at the ser5-leu6 and the his16-leu17 bonds and  the human big endothelin at several bonds involving hydrophobic amino acid residues. the big endothelin fragment 22-38 was also hydrolyzed at a high rate. the degradation of endothelin by coccolysin resembles the peptidolytic processing of endothelin by thermolysin. because e. faecalis is associated with a large number of infectious diseases, it is possible that the manifestation of inflammatory conditions in the presence of this organism is related to the coccolysin-catalyzed inactivation of endothelin.

TI  == molecules of streptococcus gordonii that bind to porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == interbacterial binding is considered an important colonization mechanism for many of the organisms that inhabit dental plaque. porphyromonas gingivalis, a periodontal pathogen, can adhere to species that comprise early plaque, such as streptococcus gordonii. in this study, the molecules of s. gordonii g9b that mediate binding to p. gingivalis were investigated. biotinylated surface molecules of s. gordonii were extracted and mixed with p. gingivalis cells. interactive streptococcal components were identified by sds-page of the p. gingivalis cells followed by electroblotting, and visualization of the adsorbed streptococcal molecules with streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase. s. gordonii molecules of 45 kda and a doublet of 62/60 kda were observed to bind to p. gingivalis. polyclonal antibodies raised to the 62/60 kda proteins inhibited the  binding interaction. these antibodies demonstrated an antigenic relationship between the 62/60 kda molecules and the 45 kda protein. both molecules were also  antigenically related to, and may be breakdown products of, a larger molecule of  170 kda which is antigenically related to the p1 antigen of s. mutans. cloning and expression in enterococcus faecalis of the gene for the p1-like molecule from s. gordonii m5 resulted in a phenotype that expressed the 62/60 kda and 45 kda antigens and was capable of binding to p. gingivalis. these results suggest that  a p1-like molecule in s. gordonii is involved in adherence to p. gingivalis. processing of the p1-like molecule into smaller fragments of 62/60 kda and 45 kda may be required for binding activity.

AB  == the histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein (hpr) is a central component of the phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system (pts) that transports carbohydrates across the cell membrane of bacteria. the three-dimensional structure of gram-positive streptococcus faecalis hpr has been determined using the method of multiple isomorphous replacement. the r factor for all data is 0.156 for s. faecalis hpr at 1.6 a resolution with very good geometry. the overall folding topology of hpr is a classical open-faced beta-sandwich, consisting of four antiparallel beta-strands and three alpha-helices. remarkable  disallowed ramachandran torsion angles of ala16 at the active center, revealed by the x-ray structure of s. faecalis hpr, demonstrate a unique example of torsion-angle strain that is likely involved directly in protein function. a brief report concerning the torsion-angle strain has been presented recently. a newly-determined ph 7.0 structure is shown to have the same open conformation of  the active center and the same torsion-angle strain at ala16, suggesting that ph  is not responsible for the structural observations. the current structure suggests a role for residues 12 and 51 in hpr's function, since they are involved in the active center through direct and indirect hydrogen-bonding interactions with the imidazole ring of his15. it is found that ser46, the regulatory site in  hpr from gram-positive bacteria, n-caps the minor alpha-b helix and is also involved in the asn43-ser46 beta-turn. this finding, in conjunction with the proposed routes of communication between the regulatory site ser46 and the active center in s. faecalis hpr, provides new insight into the understanding of how ser46 might function. the putative involvement of the c-terminal alpha-carboxyl group and the related gly67-glu70 reverse beta-turn with respect to the function  of hpr are described.

AB  == the antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of kri 1 paste, an iodoform-based primary tooth filling material, were compared with zinc oxide-eugenol (zoe), using in vitro techniques. antimicrobial evaluation involved measuring inhibition zones of streptococcus faecalis on brain heart agar. cytotoxicity evaluation involved direct cell-medicament contact experiments of 4-hr and 24-hr duration using fresh and set medicaments, and indirect cell-medicament contact experiments of 24-hr duration using fresh and set medicaments. zoe produced a greater zone of bacterial inhibition than kri 1 paste. kri 1 paste cytotoxicity remained high regardless of the amount of setting time in the 4-hr direct contact experiment, while zoe cytotoxicity decreased with setting time. both kri 1 paste and zoe had  high cytotoxicity regardless of setting time in the 24-hr direct cell-medicament  contact test. zoe cytotoxicity decreased to control levels after only 1 day of setting in the indirect contact experiments, compared with greater than 7 days for kri 1 paste. the results suggest zoe has better antimicrobial activity than kri 1 paste. zoe also has lower cytotoxicity, although prolonged cell-medicament  contact may result in both medicaments having similarly high cytotoxicity.

TI  == [antibiotic activities of cefpirome against fresh clinical isolates resistant to  multiple drugs].
AB  == using multiple drug-resistant clinical isolates isolated since september 1992, minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cefpirome (cpr) were determined. several control drugs were also used, and these mic-determinations were made to determine the antibiotic activity of cpr. the obtained results are summarized as  follows: 1. antibiotic activities of cpr against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus spp., enterococcus faecalis, and benzylpenicillin-insensitive or resistant streptococcus pneumoniae showed that expanded antibacterial spectrum of cpr and its enhanced antibiotic action against gram-positive bacteria. we suggest that among the existing fourth-generation cephem antibiotics, cpr is "characteristically strong against gram-positive bacteria". 2. strong antibiotic  activities of cpr were recognized against bacteria of family enterobacteriaceae that were resistant to the third-generation cephems. the strong antibiotic activities appeared to be due to cpr's stability and decreased affinity for beta-lactamase. 3. antibacterial spectrum of cpr was expanded against non-glucose fermented gram-negative bacilli including pseudomonas aeruginosa. it appears that this expansion of antibacterial spectrum is due to cpr's affinities for a wide range of penicillin-binding proteins as well as its improved permeability into tissues.

TI  == protein-sulfenic acid stabilization and function in enzyme catalysis and gene regulation.
AB  == sulfenic acids (r-soh) result from the stoichiometric oxidations of thiols with mild oxidants such as h2o2; in solution, however, these derivatives accumulate only transiently due to rapid self-condensation reactions, further oxidations to  the sulfinic and/or sulfonic acids, and reactions with nucleophiles such as r-sh. in contrast, oxidations of cysteinyl side chains in proteins, where disulfide bond formation can be prevented and where the reactivity of the nascent cysteine-sulfenic acid (cys-soh) can be controlled, have previously been shown to yield stable active-site cys-soh derivatives of papain and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. more recently, however, functional cys-soh residues have been identified in the native oxidized forms of the fad-containing nadh peroxidase and nadh oxidase from streptococcus faecalis; these two proteins constitute a new class within the flavoprotein disulfide reductase family. in addition, cys-soh derivatives have been suggested to play important roles in redox regulation of the dna-binding activities of transcription factors such as fos and jun, oxyr, and bovine papillomavirus type 1 e2 protein. structural inferences for the stabilization of protein-sulfenic acids, drawn from the refined 2.16-a structure of the streptococcal nadh peroxidase, provide a molecular basis for understanding the proposed redox functions of these novel cofactors in both enzyme catalysis and transcriptional regulation.

(1987) j. biol. chem. 262, 12926-12929), the overall structure is, in general, similar to other reported nmr and x-ray hpr structures, although there are some important differences in detail. the overall folding topology of hpr is a classical open-faced beta-sandwich, consisting of four antiparallel beta-strands and three alpha-helices. the least square refinement produced an r index of 0.135 for all measured unique data between 8.0 and 2.0 a resolution. the active center consists of his15 which is hydrogen bonded to a sulfate anion, and arg17 which has a fully open conformation. this corresponds to the first observed "semi-closed" conformation of the active center of hpr. the streptococcus faecalis hpr structure (jia, z., vandonselaar, m., quail, j. w., and delbaere, l. t. j. (1993) nature 361, 94-97) has the "open" conformation in which the side chains of his15 and arg17 are directed as far away from each other as possible. the bacillus subtilis hpr (herzberg, o., reddy, p., sutrina, s., saier, m. h., jr., reizer, j., and kapadia, g. (1992) proc. natl. acad. sci. u.s.a. 89, 2499-2503) has the "closed" conformation in which the side chains of his15 and arg17 are close together with a sulfate anion located in the active center. the open conformation represents the unphosphorylated form of hpr whereas the closed conformation likely resembles the phosphorylated form of hpr. the semi-closed conformation observed in the e. coli hpr structure could represent a  structural intermediate on the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation pathway of hpr.

TI  == streptococcal update. a microbiology perspective.
AB  == the streptococci remain important human pathogens despite it being nearly 60 years since sulphonamides were introduced. rheumatic fever and post glomerulonephritis are common diseases in the aboriginal community, and a new invasive disease, toxic shock-like syndrome, is also caused by group a streptococcus. group b, first described over 50 years ago in obstetric wards remains the primary neonatal pathogen despite attempts to eliminate this organism from the genital tract of the carrier mother. a major concern in paediatrics is the relatively poor response to the current pneumococcal vaccines. australian researchers are playing a major role in developing a new vaccine with high antigenicity against all of the 100 odd serotypes of s pneumoniae. the oral streptococci are now recognised as important opportunistic pathogens and the pathogenesis is well defined. disturbing reports from different geographical regions alert us to the antibiotic resistance in some of the streptococci once thought of as sensitive bacteria, for example, group a has shown resistance to erythromycin, the pneumococcus to penicillin and beta-lactam antibiotics and the  aminoglycosides have been ineffective against the enterococci due to plasmid-borne genes.

TI  == molecular cloning, identification, and sequence of the hyaluronan synthase gene from group a streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the hyaluronan (ha) synthase of group a streptococci has been identified by transposon mutagenesis and deletion analysis. the genes for the ha synthase and a recently identified udp-glc dehydrogenase (dougherty, b. a., and van de rijn, i.  (1993) j. biol. chem. 268, 7118-7124) reside on a contiguous stretch of 3.2-kilobase pair dna that can direct ha biosynthesis in enterococcus faecalis and escherichia coli as well as mutant streptococcus (deangelis, p. l., papaconstantinou, j., and weigel, p. h. (1993) j. biol. chem. 268, 14568-14571).  the synthase contains 395 residues (calculated mr = 45,063) and migrates on sds-page with a molecular mass of 42 kda. e. coli k5, which synthesizes udp-glucuronic acid for production of its endogenous capsular polysaccharide, can make ha if it contains a plasmid encoding the intact 42-kda protein. e. coli sure or chi 1448 cells containing the same construct, however, cannot produce ha since these strains cannot make both required sugar nucleotide precursors. the ha synthase is predicted to be an integral membrane protein with four membrane-associated helices, which is consistent with the location of the enzyme  activity in streptococci. there is significant homology between the ha synthase and the rhizobium nodc gene product, an enzyme that synthesizes chitin-like oligomers. this is the first description at the molecular level of an enzyme shown to synthesize a glycosaminoglycan.

AB  == streptococcosis is a major disease of several fish species in australia, japan and south africa. the minimum inhibitory concentration of some ionophores (lasalocid, monensin, narasin and salinomycin) was determined in vitro for an enterococcus-like species pathogenic for rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss) in australia. forty isolates of the fish pathogen were tested, together with control strains of staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212 and streptococcus bovis atcc 9809. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of erythromycin, the drug of choice for controlling streptococcosis, ranged between  0.1 and 0.8 microgram/ml whereas the mic values for the ionophores ranged between 0.2 and 1.5 micrograms/ml. of the ionophores tested, narasin was the most inhibitory (0.2-0.4 microgram/ml), while monensin was the least inhibitory (0.4-1.5 micrograms/ml). salinomycin was marginally more inhibitory (0.4-0.8 microgram/ml) than lasalocid (0.8 microgram/ml).

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of sultamicillin against clinical isolates obtained from outpatients].
AB  == minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for sultamicillin (sbtpc), and for other major oral beta-lactam agents against clinically isolated  strains collected from outpatients during a period from august, 1992 to february, 1993, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. the ratio of penicillinase  (pcase)-producing strains of staphylococcus aureus was 96.0% and that of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) was 12.0%. mic90 of sbtpc against s. aureus including mrsa was 6.25 micrograms/ml. no increasing tendency was observed for s. aureus resistant to sbtpc. 2. no resistant strains were found among streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis against penicillins (pcs) including sbtpc. but pcs and cephems (ceps) insensitive or resistant streptococcus pneumoniae were observed in 22.0% among all the strains of s. pneumoniae. 3. 100% of the tested both strains of escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis were beta-lactamase producers. 12.0% of the tested strains of haemophilus influenzae and 16.0% of the strains of neisseria gonorrhoeae were also beta-lactamase producers. sbtpc showed strong antimicrobial activity against most of these beta-lactamase producing strains. however, in our study of beta-lactamase productivity using plural substrates and test methods, it appeared that a part of strains of e. coli might produce beta-lactamase of "extended broad-spectrum". mics of sbtpc and ceps against those strains were distributed rather in a high range. 4. the results of the study suggested that the resistant  strains of s. pneumoniae against pcs and ceps might be increasing year by year. some of strains of e. coli, resistance against the 2 agents were observed. it is  important to keep observing changes in resistance of such organisms in the future. 5. the antimicrobial activities of sbtpc against clinically isolated strains in this study indicated potential problems such as those mentioned above. it is, however, also confirmed that sbtpc shows still strong antimicrobial activities against most of beta-lactamase producing strains found in daily medical examinations. taking into consideration of the strong activities of sbtpc against so-called indirect pathogenicity caused by beta-lactamase producing indigenous bacteria reported lately, sbtpc may be a useful antibiotic for community acquired infections in the 1990's.

TI  == female genital tract abscess formation in the rat. use of pathogens including enterococci.
AB  == previous animal experiments utilizing bowel flora have demonstrated synergy between various aerobes and anaerobes in the formation of intraabdominal abscesses. in these experiments, human female genital tract isolates were inserted into the abdominal and pelvic cavities of 151 female sprague-dawley rats. inoculation with any single species of organism--streptococcus faecalis, enterobacter cloacae or bacteroides bivius or a combination of two facultative organisms (s faecalis plus e cloacae)--did not result in a significant increase in abscess formation. combination of a facultative organism or organisms with the anaerobe b bivius or s faecalis plus b bivius plus e cloacae resulted in 55% (p < .01) and 74% (p < .0005) rates of abscess formation, respectively, as compared with controls. combinations including b fragilis demonstrated similar results. thus, female genital tract facultative organisms demonstrate synergy in the presence of anaerobic organisms in the development of abscesses.

TI  == development of a dna probe for streptococcus bovis by using a cloned amylase gene.
AB  == streptococcus bovis is a normal inhabitant of the rumen but has been implicated as a causative agent for ruminal lactic acidosis and related problems. while rarely isolated from humans, s. bovis has been identified as a causative agent for endocarditis, meningitis, and septicemia. recent reports have also suggested  a correlation between human colonic carcinoma and increased levels of s. bovis. identification of s. bovis strains of human origin has been problematic because of variations in results of biochemical tests compared with results for ruminal strains. we have tested a cloned amylase gene from the ruminal strain s. bovis jb1 as a potential dna probe for rapid and accurate identification of s. bovis strains from all sources. dnas from strains identified as s. bovis, of both human and ruminal origin, were found to hybridize with the probe under stringent conditions. the probe also hybridized with variants of s. bovis that did not grow on starch. the probe did not hybridize with dna isolated from other bacteria of human colonic and ruminal origin, including bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ruminicola, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and enterococcus faecalis but  did demonstrate hybridization with streptococcus salivarius.

TI  == deamidation of hpr, a phosphocarrier protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system, involves asparagine 38 (hpr-1) and asparagine 12 (hpr-2) in isoaspartyl acid formation.
AB  == histidine-containing protein, hpr, of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system in escherichia coli, when incubated at elevated temperatures forms many species of protein. the two major species are hpr-1 and hpr-2, which have been shown to lack one or two amides, respectively (anderson, b., weigel, n., kundig, w., and roseman, s. (1971) j. biol. chem. 246, 7023-7033). the formation of hpr-1 and hpr-2 is shown to be ph-dependent and does not occur readily below ph 6. investigation of the identities and properties of the two residues that deamidate involved creation of site-directed mutants at the 6 glutamine and 2 asparagine residues of hpr; description of their deamidation species by isoelectric focusing; determination of their relative antibody binding properties; assay of their phosphoacceptor and phosphodonor activities; characterization of tryptic and v8-protease peptides; obtaining two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of hpr, hpr-1, and several mutants. it was determined that the sequential deamidation of asn-38 and asn-12 yields hpr-1 and  hpr-2. both residues exist as asn-gly pairs, and both deamidations probably form  isoaspartyl acid. hpr from bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus carnosus which also have asn-gly at residues 38 and 39 form hpr-1 species presumably by deamidation. hpr from streptococcus faecalis which does not have asn-38 does not  form a hpr-1 species. the e. coli mutant hprs, n12d and q51e, residues that may be involved in the active site, had impaired phosphohydrolysis properties and decreased phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system activity.

TI  == multicentre survey of the comparative in-vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam against bacteria from hospitalized patients in the british isles.
AB  == twenty-nine british and irish hospitals each collected up to 300 bacterial isolates from in-patients. the organisms were identified by an appropriate api system or, for staphylococci, by their gram and coagulase reactions. disc susceptibility tests were performed. isolates that gave zones < or = 25 mm to piperacillin/tazobactam (75 micrograms + 10 micrograms) discs were sent to a central laboratory for re-examination and determination of mic, together with a sample of the more susceptible organisms. results were evaluated for 6724 isolates. over 95% of the isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiellae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus, moraxella and bacteriodes, spp. streptococci, pneumococci and enterococcus faecalis were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam (defined as giving a zone > or = 22 mm to a 75 micrograms + 10 micrograms disc), as were 86% of acinetobacter spp. and 82% of the citrobacter, enterobacter, morganella and serratia group. tazobactam particularly extended the activity of piperacillin against e. coli isolates (96% susceptible cf. 61% to piperacillin alone) klebsiellae (95% cf. 70%), p. mirabilis (99% cf. 86%), and acinetobacter spp. (86% cf. 53%). occasional (18%) resistance in enterobacter, serratia and citrobacger spp. was probably caused by stable depression of class i beta-lactamases, which are inhibited poorly by tazobactam.  high resistance frequencies (> 25%) were found for enterococcus faecium and xanthomonas maltophilia. tazobactam potentiated piperacillin against beta-lactamase-producing methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, but the mode inhibition zone of piperacillin/tazobactam discs was only 26 mm, compared to 38 mm for beta-lactamase-negative isolates. nevertheless, fewer than 5% of the enzyme producers appeared resistant to 8 + 4 mg/l piperacillin/tazobactam in mic  tests. similar behaviour was noted for coagulase-negative staphylococci. amongst  the eleven comparator drugs, ceftazidime, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin were as active as piperacillin/tazobactam against most enterobacteria. however, acinetobacter and bacteroides spp. and enterococci were resistant to ceftazidime, and bacteroides spp., enterococci, pneumococci and other streptococci were inherently resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. cefuroxime, ampicillin and  co-amoxiclav had narrower spectra. only imipenem showed a consistently wider spectrum and lower frequency of resistance than piperacillin/tazobactam.

AB  == a contiguous 3-kilobase pair region of dna was isolated from group a streptococcus pyogenes (gas) that can direct hyaluronic acid (ha) capsule biosynthesis in acapsular mutants as well as heterologous bacteria. the dna was identified by transposon 916 insertional mutagenesis and subcloned into a plasmid shuttle vector. mutant acapsular gas or enterococcus faecalis containing this plasmid, but not vector alone, displayed a mucoid phenotype on agar plates, possessed a capsule as seen by light microscopy, and produced ha in quantities comparable with wild-type gas. the polysaccharide was shown to be authentic ha based on its recognition by a specific proteoglycan and its degradation by streptomyces hyaluronate lyase. escherichia coli with the complementing plasmid also produced ha but at only 10% of the level made by the above cells. e. coli minicell analysis showed that two proteins, 42 and 45 kda, are expressed by the functional dna insert. deletion analysis of the insert in the minicells revealed  that the 42-kda protein is essential for ha production. this is the first demonstration of reconstitution of ha capsule biosynthesis in vivo.

TI  == complementation of an enterococcus hirae (streptococcus faecalis) mutant in the alpha subunit of the h(+)-atpase by cloned genes from the same and different species.
AB  == we isolated an enterococcus hirae (formerly streptococcus faecalis) mutant, designated ms117, in which 'g' at position 301 of the alpha-subunit gene of the f1f0 type of h(+)-atpase was deleted. ms117 had low h(+)-atpase activity, was deficient in the regulatory system of cytoplasmic ph, and was unable to grow at ph 6.0. when the alpha-subunit gene of e. hirae h(+)-atpase was ligated with the  shuttle vector phy300plk at the downstream region of the tet gene of the vector,  it was expressed without its own promoter in ms117, and the mutation of ms117 was complemented; the mutant harbouring the plasmid had the ability to maintain a neutral cytoplasm and grew at ph 6.0. we next transformed ms117 with phy300plk containing the alpha-subunit gene of bacillus megaterium f1f0-atpase constructed  in the same way. the transformant grew at ph 6.0, and the atp hydrolysis activity was recovered. these results suggested that an active hybrid h(+)-atpase containing the b. megaterium alpha subunit was produced, and that the hybrid enzyme regulated the enterococcal cytoplasmic ph, although the function of the b. megaterium enzyme did not include ph regulation. thus, our present results support the previous proposal that the enterococcal cytoplasmic ph is regulated by the f1f0 type of h(+)-atpase.

TI  == presumptive fecal streptococci in environmental samples characterized by one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  == the use of fecal streptococci as fecal indicators requires better knowledge of the ecology of these bacteria. we isolated 371 presumptive fecal streptococci from environmental samples--domestic wastewater, forest industry wastewater, contaminated surface and seawater, well water, cow dung, bird droppings, and pristine waters--and clustered them according to their protein profiles in one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. some clusters could be tentatively identified with the help of reference strains. samples from each environment had a typical composition of streptococcus types. enterococcus faecalis was present, but not as a dominating enterococcal species, in samples in which fecal contamination was probable. enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, enterococcus hirae, and enterococcus mundtii had protein profiles that were difficult to distinguish from each other.  these bacteria were found in a variety of samples. enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum had identical protein profiles. on the basis of the maximum temperatures for growth and pigment production, isolates of this protein  profile group common in forest industry wastewaters were identified as e. casseliflavus. lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis was also found in this environment. nearly all strains from pristine waters belonged to protein profile  groups which could not be identified with the aid of known aerococcus, enterococcus, lactococcus, or streptococcus strains. the maximum temperatures for growth and the results of fatty acid analysis were in general agreement within each protein profile group.

AB  == the sporulation-related gamma-d-glutamyl-(l)meso-diaminopimelic-acid-hydrolysing  peptidase i of bacillus sphaericus nctc 9602 has been analysed by proton-induced  x-ray emission. it contains 1 equivalent zn2+ per mol of protein. as derived from gene cloning and sequencing, the b. sphaericus zn peptidase i is a two-module protein. a 100-amino-acid-residue n-terminal domain consisting of two tandem segments of similar sequences, is fused to a 296-amino-acid-residue c-terminal catalytic domain. the catalytic domain belongs to the zn carboxypeptidase a family, the closest match being observed with the streptomyces griseus carboxypeptidase [narahashi (1990) j. biochem. 107, 879-886] and with the family  prototype, bovine carboxypeptidase a. the catalytic domain of the b. sphaericus peptidase i possesses, distributed along the amino-acid sequence, peptide segments, a triad his162-glu165-his307 and a dyad tyr347-glu366 that are equivalent to secondary structures, the zinc-binding triad his69-glu72-his196 and the catalytic dyad tyr248-glu270 of bovine carboxypeptidase a respectively. the n-terminal repeats of the b. sphaericus peptidase i have similarity with the c-terminal repeats of the enterococcus hirae muramidase 2, the streptococcus (now enterococcus) faecalis autolysin and the bacillus phi pza and phi 29 lysozymes, to which a role in the recognition of a particular moiety of the bacterial cell envelope has been tentatively assigned. detergents enhance considerably the specific activity of the b. sphaericus peptidase i.

TI  == the microbiologic aspects, including diagnosis, of beta-hemolytic streptococcal and enterococcal infections.
AB  == basic principles concerning the collection, transport, and processing of clinical specimens for the detection of streptococcaceae are given. identification of beta-hemolytic streptococci (s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, lancefield group c and g streptococci, s. anginosus) and enterococci is based on the careful observation of colony morphology and hemolytic pattern on sheep blood agar plates; subsequent genus or species confirmation is achieved by rather simple biochemical or enzymatic tests and by detection of streptococcal cell wall carbohydrate antigens (lancefield grouping). rapid antigen tests for the detection of group a and b streptococci directly from pharyngeal and vaginal swabs, respectively, are highly specific, thus allowing an immediate antibiotic therapy in patients with a positive test result. the reported sensitivities of these nonculture tests are too low to exclude streptococcal colonization or infection, however. the elucidation of the genetics of some major virulence factors of group a and b streptococci has contributed to knowledge of their association with disease, and  molecular techniques have supplemented the traditional (mostly culture and serologic) methods for an improved understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of streptococcal infections. recently employed examples include the  m protein gene typing of group a streptococci by oligonucleotide probes and the use of pcr assays for the detection of the genes encoding for the pyrogenic exotoxins. restriction enzyme endonuclease digestions of bacterial dna in association with dna fragment separation by conventional or pfge have been applied successfully to several species of streptococcaceae (e.g., s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae). enterococci are important pathogens in the hospital setting, exhibiting high morbidity and mortality rates in bacteremic patients with severe  underlying disease. molecular typing methods have clearly confirmed their potential to be nosocomially transmitted. e. faecalis and e. faecium still account for the majority of human infections, but some of the newer enterococcal  species (at present 19 species are recognized) have been encountered as well. the definitive species identification of enterococci requires the performance of an array of biochemical tests. the increasing antimicrobial resistance of enterococci, including high-level resistance to penicillins and aminoglycosides and occasionally also to glycopeptides, has hampered standard therapeutic regimens. all enterococci isolated from serious infections should be tested for high-level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance by one of several methods evaluated; beta-lactamase production (primarily found in e. faecalis) is reliably detected by the nitrocefin test.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == the efficacy of teicoplanin in the treatment of endocarditis caused by gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == twenty-six patients with endocarditis caused by streptococcus viridans (n = 12),  enterococcus faecalis (n = 5), streptococcus bovis (n = 2), staphylococcus aureus (n = 3) and staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 4) were treated with teicoplanin at a dose of 600 mg/day in patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance 80-120 ml/min) and at a dose of 400 mg/day in patients with moderately impaired renal function (creatinine clearance < 75 ml/min). in nine patients valve replacements were performed. twenty-one patients were cured by medical treatment  with teicoplanin, five patients had a surgical intervention during treatment which was subsequently stopped. overall, eighteen patients with native valve endocarditis were cured. out of eight patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis six patients were cured. in one patient teicoplanin therapy was withdrawn because of clinical failure. one patient had a clinical relapse. all cultures taken from  blood, endocardium and excised artificial valves were sterile after a minimum of  seven days therapy. side effects were seen in seven patients and included a moderate increase in liver enzymes and mild leucopenia. no renal toxicity was observed, trough serum levels of teicoplanin were not correlated with renal function, a slight accumulation of teicoplanin on day 28 being seen. our study confirms that teicoplanin is effective as single agent therapy in the treatment of endocarditis due to gram-positive bacteria.

AB  == the effects of combined treatment with ok-432, an immunomodulator prepared from streptococcus haemolyticus, and aztreonam, a monobactum antibiotic, in the prevention of radiation-induced bacteraemia and mortality were examined in icr-mch mice irradiated with 9.5 gy. the organisms recovered from the irradiated  mice were streptococcus faecalis and proteus mirabilis. treatment with aztreonam  reduced the incidence of mice infected with proteus mirabilis (p < 0.01), but it  showed no efficacy on streptococcus faecalis. ok-432 could reduce the frequency of bacteraemia attributed to both organisms (p < 0.05). combined treatment with ok-432 and aztreonam further decreased the incidence of bacteraemia by both organisms; no organisms were recovered at 14 days following irradiation. the survival rate at 30 days following irradiation was 80% in mice treated with ok-432 plus aztreonam and 55% with ok-432 alone, while it was 0% in the groups treated with aztreonam or saline alone. these results indicated that combined treatment with ok-432 and a suitable antibiotic such as aztreonam is more effective than ok-432 or aztreonam alone.

TI  == purification and analysis of streptococcal nadh peroxidase expressed in escherichia coli.
AB  == using the t7 rna polymerase expression system, a modified plasmid vector has been developed which gives reliable, high level expression in escherichia coli of the  gene encoding streptococcal nadh peroxidase. the recombinant enzyme has been purified to homogeneity using a revised protocol which yields over 35 mg of pure  protein per liter of culture. recombinant nadh peroxidase is fully active and exhibits spectroscopic and redox properties identical to those for the enzyme purified from streptococcus faecalis 10c1. reductive titrations and thiol analyses confirm the presence of the unusual cysteine-sulfenic acid (cys-soh) redox center identified previously. n-terminal sequence analysis, analytical gel  filtration, and preliminary x-ray diffraction data all confirm the structural identity of the recombinant and s. faecalis enzymes. steady-state kinetic analysis of the peroxidase, coupled with results from static titration experiments is consistent with a limiting type of ternary complex mechanism and allows the determination of many of the corresponding kinetic constants. in addition, preliminary 1h nmr spectra of the enzyme at millimolar concentrations show good dispersion in the amide region and indicate that the recombinant peroxidase is suitable for one-dimensional nmr work with labeled amino acids.

TI  == nadh binding site and catalysis of nadh peroxidase.
AB  == the structure of the complex between cofactor nadh and the enzyme nadh peroxidase from streptococcus faecalis 10c1 (enterococcus faecalis) has been determined by crystal soaking, x-ray data collection, model building of nadh and refinement at  0.24-nm resolution based on the known enzyme structure [stehle, t., ahmed, s. a., claiborne, a. & schulz, g. e. (1991) j. mol. biol. 221, 1325-1344]. apart from nadh, the catalytic center of the enzyme contains fad and a cysteine that shuttles between thiolate and sulfenic acid states. unfortunately, this cysteine  was irreversibly oxidized to a cysteine sulfonic acid in the established enzyme structure. based on the geometry of the catalytic center, we discuss the stabilization of the oxidation-sensitive sulfenic acid and propose a reaction mechanism.

TI  == active-centre torsion-angle strain revealed in 1.6 a-resolution structure of histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein.
AB  == the histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein (hpr) is a central component of the phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system that transports carbohydrates across the cell membrane of bacteria. a typical phosphotransfer sequence is phosphoenolpyruvate-->enzyme i-->hpr-->enzyme ii/iiisugar-->sugar. this is thermodynamically favourable owing to the participation of the high-energy phosphoenolpyruvate. we report here the structure of hpr from streptococcus faecalis determined at 1.6 a resolution. remarkable disallowed ramachandran torsion angles at the active centre, revealed by the x-ray structure, demonstrate a unique example of torsion-angle strain that is probably  directly involved in protein function. during phosphorylation, the active-centre  torsion-angle strain should facilitate the phosphotransfer reaction by lowering the activation-energy barrier. a recently reported bacillus subtilis hpr structure, which represents the phosphorylated state of hpr with no torsion-angle strain, provides direct evidence supporting our hypothesis that torsion-angle strain plays a direct part in the function of hpr. an hpr phosphotransfer cycling mechanism is proposed, based primarily on the structures of hpr and other phosphotransferase system proteins.

TI  == biochemical and genetic analysis of the unidirectional theta replication of the s. agalactiae plasmid pip501.
AB  == pip501 is a broad-host-range plasmid originating from streptococcus agalactiae. in this report we show that (i) it replicates by a theta mechanism initiating at  the 3' end of the gene encoding the replication protein repr and progressing in the direction of transcription of this gene; (ii) its replication origin lies within or a few nucleotides downstream from orf r and not upstream from it as suggested in the literature (brantl et al. (1990) nucleic acids res. 18, 4783-4789); (iii) the repr protein positively regulates pip501 copy number; and (vi) the main function ensured by the sequences located upstream from orf r is to express this orf. since the replication properties of pip501 are indistinguishable from those of the highly related enterococcus faecalis plasmid  pam beta 1, we conclude that these elements form the first family of theta replicating plasmids in gram-positive bacteria. based on sequence similarities, we extend this family to the s. pyogenes plasmid psm19035 and to 12 other plasmids isolated from streptococci or enterococci.

TI  == catalytic properties of streptococcal nadh oxidase containing artificial flavins.
AB  == the flavoprotein nadh oxidase from streptococcus faecalis 10c1, which catalyzes the tetravalent reduction of o2-->2h2o, has been purified as the apoenzyme to allow reconstitution studies with both native and artificial flavins. turnover numbers for the enzyme containing 1-deaza-, 2-thio-, and 4-thio-fad range from 51 to 4% of that of the native fad enzyme; these reconstituted oxidases also catalyze the four-electron reduction of oxygen. dithionite and nadh titrations of the native fad oxidase require 1.7 eq of reductant/fad and follow spectral courses very similar to those previously reported for the purified holoenzyme. azide is a linear mixed-type inhibitor with respect to nadh, and dithionite titrations in the presence of azide yield significant stabilization of the neutral blue semiquinone. redox stoichiometries for the oxidase containing modified flavins range from 1.1 to 1.4 eq of reductant/fad. spectrally distinct reduced enzyme.nad+ complexes result with all but the 2-thio-fad enzyme on titration with nadh. the reduced 4-thio-fad oxidase shows little or no evidence of desulfurization to native fad on reduction and reoxidation. both the 8-mercapto- (e'o = -290 mv) and 8-hydroxy-fad (e'o = -335 mv) oxidase are readily reduced by excess nadh. these results offer a further basis for analysis of the active-site structure and oxygen reactivity of this unique flavoprotein oxidase.

TI  == molecular cloning and analysis of the gene encoding the nadh oxidase from streptococcus faecalis 10c1. comparison with nadh peroxidase and the flavoprotein disulfide reductases.
AB  == the gene encoding the streptococcal flavoprotein nadh oxidase (noxase), which catalyzes the four-electron reduction of o2-->2h2o, has been cloned and sequenced from the genome of streptococcus (enterococcus) faecalis 10c1 (atcc 11700). the deduced noxase protein sequence corresponds to a molecular mass of 48.9 kda and contains three previously sequenced cysteinyl peptides obtained with the purified enzyme. in escherichia coli, the expressed nox gene produced a catalytically active product, which retained its immunoreactivity to affinity-purified noxase antisera. alignment of the noxase protein sequence with that of streptococcal nadh peroxidase (npxase) revealed that the proteins are 44% identical. among the  most highly conserved segments is a sequence containing cys42; this residue is known to exist as a stabilized cysteine-sulfenic acid (cys-soh) in npxase and serves as the non-flavin redox center. in addition, three previously identified npxase segments, known to be involved in fad and nad(p)-binding in other pyridine nucleotide-linked flavoprotein oxidoreductases, are strongly conserved in noxase. overall, the extensive homology observed between noxase and npxase suggests that  the monomer chain fold of the oxidase closely resembles that of the peroxidase. both sequences share limited but significant homology to those of glutathione reductase and other members of the flavoprotein disulfide reductase family. these and other considerations suggest that these two unusual streptococcal flavoproteins constitute a distinct class of fad-dependent oxidoreductases, the flavoprotein peroxide reductases, easily contrasted with enzymes such as glutathione reductase and thioredoxin reductase.

TI  == culture media for enterococci and group d-streptococci.
AB  == lancefield group d-streptococci are contaminants of various food commodities, especially those of animal origin. they encompass the new genus enterococcus comprising 13 known species and some species of streptococci which have their habitat in the intestine of animals, e.g. streptococcus bovis, suis and equinus.  the serologically based grouping may no longer constitute the best definition for streptococci from the food chain. food hygiene monitoring systems using enterococci as indicators need reliable methods for selective cultivation and identification of marker strains. up to now more than 100 modifications of selective media have been described for isolating streptococci or enterococci from various specimens. the selection of a medium requires either experience or consultation. it depends on the kind of specimen, the method of cultivation (plate count or membrane filter) and whether or not the habitat is heavily contaminated with other organisms. the choice of media is made more difficult as  commercial versions of the same culture medium may vary in recipe and/or performance from producer to producer. therefore, reviewing the literature may help in the choice of medium and confirmation tests. the selectivity and productivity of some commonly used or cited media are reported here, partly based on our own experience: citrate azide tween carbonate agar (catc), kanamycin aesculin azide agar (kaa) and m-enterococcus agar (me) including earlier results  with aesculin bile azide agar (aba), and thallous acetate tetrazolium glucose agar (titg). no medium was completely selective for all group d-streptococci or for all enterococci but some media were highly selective for a single enterococcus species, e.g., for e. faecalis which serves as indicator of human pollution. confirmatory tests must be carried out when experience in the evaluation procedure is limited. selective media for enterococci should be used only after or while checking in parallel their selectivity and productivity against appropriate test organisms.

AB  == enterococcus hirae (formerly streptococcus faecalis) atcc 9790 has an f1f0-atpase which functions as a regulator of the cytoplasmic ph but does not synthesize atp. we isolated four clones which contained genes for c, b, delta, and alpha subunits of this enzyme but not for other subunit genes. it was revealed that two specific regions (upstream of the c-subunit gene and downstream of the gamma-subunit gene) were lost at a specific site in the clones we isolated, suggesting that these regions were unstable in escherichia coli. the deleted regions were amplified by  polymerase chain reaction, and the nucleotide sequences of these regions were determined. the results showed that eight genes for a, c, b, delta, alpha, gamma, beta, and epsilon subunits were present in this order. northern (rna) blot analysis showed that these eight genes were transcribed to one mrna. the i gene was not found in the upper region of the a-subunit gene. instead of the i gene, this operon contained a long untranslated region (240 bp) whose g + c content was only 30%. there was no typical promoter sequence such as was proposed for e. coli, suggesting that the promoter structure of this species is different from that of e. coli. deduced amino acid sequences suggested that e. hirae h(+)-atpase is a typical f1f0-type atpase but that its gene structure is not identical to that of other bacterial f1f0-atpases.

TI  == restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of 16s ribosomal dna of streptococcus and enterococcus species of bovine origin.
AB  == twelve bacterial species including streptococcus uberis, s. parauberis, s. agalactiae, s. dysgalactiae, s. bovis, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. saccharolyticus, enterococcus faecium, e. faecalis, e. avium, and aerococcus viridans were examined for their 16s ribosomal dna fingerprint patterns. oligonucleotide primers complementary to 16s rrna genes were used to amplify by the polymerase chain reaction 16s ribosomal gene fragments from genomic dnas. the molecular sizes of the amplified 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) fragments from the 12 species examined ranged from 1,400 to 1,500 bp. restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of 16s rdna was performed with 11 different restriction endonucleases. all 12 species examined could be differentiated on the basis of characteristic 16s rdna fingerprint patterns by using the restriction endonucleases hhai, rsai, and mspi. a scheme for the differentiation of the 12 species is presented. eleven isolates representing 11 species were obtained from  cows with intramammary infections and were examined by 16s rdna fingerprinting. all 11 species isolated from cows were differentiated by using hhai, rsai, and mspi restriction endonucleases. the results of this study demonstrate the potential application of 16s rdna fingerprinting for the identification and differentiation of bacterial species.

TI  == macrophage response to bacteria: induction of marked secretory and cellular activities by lipoteichoic acids.
AB  == lipoteichoic acids (ltas) from various bacterial species, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, and listeria monocytogenes, were examined for the ability  to induce secretory and cellular responses in a pure population of bone marrow-derived mononuclear phagocytes. some of the highly purified ltas, in particular ltas from bacillus subtilis, s. pyogenes, e. faecalis, and enterococcus hirae, were able to affect each of the macrophage parameters measured, i.e., reductive capacity, secretion of tumor necrosis factor and nitrite, and tumoricidal activity. as after stimulation with whole organisms or other bacterial products, secretion of tumor necrosis factor induced by these ltas reached its maximum within the first few hours of the interaction, while secretion of nitrite and tumoricidal activity required 24 to 36 h for full expression. other purified ltas, i.e., ltas from streptococcus sanguis, s. pneumoniae, and l. monocytogenes, as well as lipomannan from micrococcus luteus affected only some of these parameters, while native lta from s. aureus was inactive. there was no obvious correlation between biological activity and chain  length, kind of glycosyl substituents, glycolipid structures, or fatty acid composition of ltas. deacylation of ltas resulted in a complete loss of activity, and deacylated ltas did not impair the activity of their acylated counterparts, suggesting that acyl chains may be essential for binding of lta to the cell surface. the results demonstrate that some lta species are potent inducers of macrophage secretory and cellular activities.

TI  == the distribution of homologous enterococcal plasmid dna sequences in human faecal isolates.
AB  == hybridization was used to investigate the distribution of enterococcal plasmid sequences among 306 strains of enterococcus and streptococcus spp. isolated from  faeces of humans of various ages. as dna probes for the survey three plasmids, whose dnas did not hybridize each other and designated as pms13, ptw34 and phk30, were selected from plasmids borne in ent. faecalis. ptw34 dna hybridized only with dnas from enterococci, with high frequency in ent. faecalis and low frequency in ent. faecium. pms13 dna hybridized with dnas of all enterococcus spp. tested and with strep. bovis, strep. equinus and strep. salivarius. eighty-five percent of ent. faecium isolates had sequences homologous to pms13 but in the other species the values were less than 60%. some enterococci had dnas which hybridized with the phk30 probe. the different distribution of the three dna sequences indicates the possibility that plasmid dnas encode advantageous phenotypes for the colonization of bacteria in the lumen of the bowel.

AB  == previous studies have established that inactivated mycobacteria are potent and selective activators of v gamma 9+/v delta 2+ human gamma/delta t cells. here we  have analysed the proliferative response of human gamma/delta t cells to five serologically distinct groups of streptococci. while heat-inactivated streptococci of all five serogroups tested (a, b, c, d and f) induced a strong proliferative response in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc), only groups  a, b and c elicited a selective activation of v gamma 9+ gamma/delta t cells in 10 (serogroup b) or 11 (serogroups a and c) of 11 tested healthy individuals. in  striking contrast, groups d and f streptococci failed to activate gamma/delta t cells in nine of 11 donors and induced only a weak gamma/delta t cell response in two additional individuals. depletion of v gamma 9+ t cells before culture completely eliminated all gamma/delta t cell responses to streptococci. these data indicate that groups a, b and c (but not d or f) streptococci can be included in the growing list of selective ligands for v gamma 9+/v delta 2+ human gamma/delta t cells.

TI  == characterization of enterococcal isolates by restriction enzyme analysis of genomic dna.
AB  == a restriction enzyme analysis (rea) of chromosomal dna for the intra-species characterization of enterococci is reported. the dna was extracted by a rapid method and digested with the restriction enzyme sal i to provide a characteristic 'fingerprint' consisting of 10-20 bands in the 1.6-5.0 kb range. one hundred and  eighty enterococcal isolates were examined; 5 were type strains, 15 from an out-patient clinic and 160 from a geographically isolated british antarctic survey base. the epidemiologically unrelated out-patient clinic isolates gave readily distinguishable patterns, whereas isolates from the geographically isolated community showed evidence of colonization. this technique provided a highly discriminatory method of isolate characterization for enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium and e. durans suitable for epidemiological studies. a sample of isolates were probed with 16 + 23 s ribosomal rna from escherichia coli. discrimination between isolates was poorer than with rea, although good correlation was observed between the results of the two techniques.

TI  == isolation, characterization, and nucleotide sequence of the streptococcus mutans  mannitol-phosphate dehydrogenase gene and the mannitol-specific factor iii gene of the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system.
AB  == streptococcus mutans, the causative agent of dental caries, utilizes carbohydrates by means of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (pts). the pts facilitates vectorial translocation of metabolizable carbohydrates to form the corresponding sugar-phosphates, which are subsequently  converted to glycolytic intermediates. the pts consists of both sugar-specific and sugar-independent components. complementation of an escherichia coli mtld mutation with a streptococcal recombinant dna library allowed isolation of the mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (mtld) and the adjacent sugar-specific mannitol factor iii gene (mtlf) from s. mutans. subsequent transposon mutagenesis of the complementing dna fragment with tn5seq1 defined the region that encodes the mtld-complementing activity, the streptococcal mtld gene. nucleotide sequence analysis of this region revealed two complete open reading frames (orfs) from within the streptococcal mannitol pts operon. one orf encodes the mtld gene product, a 43.0-kda protein which exhibits similarity to the e. coli and enterococcus faecalis mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenases. the second orf encodes a 15.8-kda protein which exhibits similarity to mannitol factor iii proteins from several bacterial species. in vitro transcription-translation assays were used to produce proteins of the sizes predicted by the streptococcal orfs. these data indicate that the s. mutans mannitol pts utilizes an enzyme ii-factor iii complex similar to the mannitol system found in other gram-positive organisms, as opposed to that of e. coli, which utilizes an independent enzyme ii system.

TI  == conditions modulating the ionic selectivity of transport by monensin examined on  enterococcus hirae (streptococcus faecalis) by 23na-nmr and k+ atomic absorption.
AB  == factors likely to modulate the ionic selectivity of monensin were examined on enterococcus hirae (streptococcus faecalis) in two states previously characterized: the resting (de-energized) cell and the active (energized) cell. internal and external na+ were followed by corresponding 23na-nmr resonances k+ concentrations were measured by atomic absorption. for a given cellular population of de-energized cells, the apparent transport rates and the final cationic concentrations reached at the steady state were decreasing with the ionophore dose. monensin was selective for sodium only at low concentrations, in  the range 1 mm-10(-4) mm the transport was depending on the effective cationic gradients. comparison of the activity curves for two cell populations (7.10(9) and 7.10(10) cells/ml) showed the importance of the ratios of monensin/mg phospholipid and also of the ratios of external/internal volumes. on energized cells, except for low monensin concentrations, the main effect was a k(+)-induced efflux and not a na+ influx. two factors were modulating the resulting selectivity of this ionophore: the response of the intrinsic bacterial carriers and the generation of the gradients (mainly the external ph) which were favourable to a k+/na+ transport. once again the results obtained for two cell populations could be compared, the determining factors were the ratio external/internal volume and the generation of the ph gradient.

TI  == gadolinium ion inhibits loss of metabolites induced by osmotic shock and large stretch-activated channels in bacteria.
AB  == bacteria subjected to a hypotonic osmotic shock lose internal ions and also metabolites, without lysis of the cells. we show that the presence in the shock medium, at submillimolar concentrations, of the ion gadolinium, recently shown to block stretch-activated channels in xenopus oocytes [yang, x.-c. & sachs, f. (1989) science 243, 1068-1071], was sufficient to inhibit shock-induced release of metabolites such as lactose and atp in escherichia coli and atp in streptococcus faecalis. moreover, gadolinium was observed, in patch-clamp experiments, to inhibit the giant stretch-activated channels of e. coli, s. faecalis. and bacillus subtilis. taken together, these data suggest that stretch-activated channels are localized in the cytoplasmic membrane of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, where they control the efflux of osmotic solutes, thus probably playing a major role in the response to hypotonic  osmotic shock.

AB  == the activity of decaplanin, a new glycopeptide, was compared to that of vancomycin, teicoplanin and daptomycin. decaplanin was two- to four-fold less active than vancomycin, telcoplanin and daptomycin against staphylococcus aureus  and staphylococcus epidermidis, with an mic90 of 2 micrograms/ml for methicillin-susceptible and 4 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant isolates. decaplanin had activity similar to that of vancomycin against streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, group c and g streptococci, with an mic90 of  0.12 micrograms/ml. it was less active than the other agents against the viridans group streptococci (mic90 4 micrograms/ml). the activity of decaplanin against enterococci (mic90 4 micrograms/ml) was similar to that of vancomycin. clostridium spp. were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml, peptostreptococci and peptococci by 0.25 microgram/ml. decaplanin was active from ph 5.5 to 7.5. inoculum size had a minimal effect on mics, and increased concentrations of ca2+  and mg2+ and 50% serum did not alter mics or mbcs.

TI  == microflora of the pouch of the koala (phascolarctos cinereus).
AB  == microflora of the pouch epithelium of 17 female koalas (phascolarctos cinereus) were examined in relation to their current reproductive status and recent reproductive history. no microbial growth was observed in pouch swabs from 13 of  17 (76%) koalas, including four females without young, seven with pouch young and two with back young (i.e. permanently emerged from the pouch). growth of bacteria or yeasts was observed in pouch swabs from four koalas, each of which had experienced mortality of its pouch young during the current breeding season. seven species of microorganisms were isolated, including pseudomonas aeruginosa,  serratia marcescens and enterococcus faecalis. based on the absence of microflora in the majority of females examined, we propose that the pouch epithelium normally provides a hostile environment for microbial colonization.

TI  == aminoglycoside-resistant streptococcus and enterococcus species isolated from bovine mammary secretions.
AB  == a total of 117 isolates representing four streptococcus species and 20 isolates representing two enterococcus species from bovine mammary secretions were examined for resistance to streptomycin, kanamycin, and gentamicin. resistance to streptomycin (85.4%) was most prevalent, followed by kanamycin (19%) and gentamicin (2.2%). minimum inhibitory concentration of streptomycin for most organisms examined ranged from 16 to 250 micrograms/ml. for kanamycin, the minimum inhibitory concentration for most organisms was .5 to 62.5 micrograms/ml. minimum inhibitory concentration for gentamicin was lower than for kanamycin. two strains each of streptococcus uberis and enterococcus faecalis had minimum inhibitory concentration for streptomycin of greater than 2000 micrograms/ml, and two strains of e. faecalis had similar minimum inhibitory concentration for kanamycin. the minimum bactericidal concentration for all organisms was one to four times higher than minimum inhibitory concentration. none of the organisms evaluated was found to carry plasmids. transfer of antibiotic resistance in plasmid-free strains was not achieved by mobilization with the aid of plasmid pad1, indicating the absence of conjugative transposons. these data suggest that  expression of aminoglycoside resistance of streptococcus and enterococcus species of bovine origin is likely due to factors other than plasmids or conjugative transposons.

TI  == a hemolysin-encoding plasmid contributes to bacterial virulence in experimental enterococcus faecalis endophthalmitis.
AB  == beta-hemolysin production is a variable trait of the lancefield group d streptococcus, enterococcus faecalis. the e. faecalis hemolysin is encoded by large transmissible plasmids. the variable nature of this putative virulence factor provided an ideal system for testing its contribution in experimental endophthalmitis. in this study, isogenic e. faecalis strains were compared to determine whether the presence of the hemolysin-encoding plasmid affected the severity of disease in a rabbit endophthalmitis model. experimental infections (n = 6) with 10(1)-10(4) e. faecalis organisms harboring the hemolysin-encoding plasmid resulted in a 98% loss of retinal function (by electroretinography [erg]) and white reflex by postoperative day 3. by contrast, infections of similar numbers of plasmid-free e. faecalis organisms (n = 5) resulted in retention of some retinal function (23% per erg) with a red reflex demonstrated on postoperative day 3. results of light microscopy, slit-lamp examination, erg, and indirect ophthalmoscopy indicated that infections with hemolysin-encoding plasmid-containing e. faecalis resulted in a more aggressive endophthalmitis compared with the endophthalmitis caused by plasmid-free e. faecalis. this is the first endophthalmitis model to the authors' knowledge that specifically evaluates bacterial virulence using isogenic strains.

TI  == degenerate oligonucleotide primers for enzymatic amplification of reca sequences  from gram-positive bacteria and mycoplasmas.
AB  == reca protein in gram-negative bacteria, especially in escherichia coli, has been  extensively studied, but little is known about this key enzyme in other procaryotes. described here are degenerate oligonucleotide primers that have been used to amplify by the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) reca sequences from several gram-positive bacteria and mycoplasmas. the dna sequences of reca pcr products from streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus mutans, enterococcus faecalis, and mycoplasma pulmonis were determined and compared. these data indicate that the m. pulmonis reca gene has diverged significantly from reca genes of other eubacteria. it should be possible to use cloned reca pcr products  to construct reca mutants, thereby providing the means of elucidating homologous  genetic recombination and dna repair activities in these organisms.

AB  == the beta-lactam resistance of genus streptococcus has been explained by the low binding affinity of penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) to the drug. this study was carried out to resolve the mechanisms of resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in the species of genus enterococcus by means of binding affinities of pbps. streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and  enterococcus avium were employed as assay microbes. cefepime (cfpm) and ampicillin (abpc) were used as representatives of cephems and penicillins, respectively. all the pbp fractions of s. pyogenes manifested high binding affinities to cfpm and abpc, whereas pbps 1 and 4 of e. faecalis showed high binding affinities to abpc but not to cfpm. in e. faecium, pbps of an exceptionally penicillin-susceptible strain manifested a high binding affinity to abpc, but pbps 5 and 6 showed low affinities to cfpm. beta-lactam resistant strains of e. faecium possessed pbps 5 and 6 with low binding affinities to cfpm  and abpc. all the fractions of pbps but pbp 1 in e. avium showed low binding affinities to cfpm. although all the pbp fractions but pbps 3 and 6 manifested high binding affinities to abpc, pbps 3 and 6 showed low binding affinities to abpc. a strain of e. avium, which is susceptible to abpc but moderately resistant to cfpm, lacked pbp 6. in conclusion, the resistance of e. avium to cfpm is based upon low binding affinities of the many fractions to this drug, and abpc resistance is based upon pbps 3 and 6 with low binding affinities to abpc.

TI  == clarithromycin in vitro activity enhanced by its major metabolite, 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.
AB  == 14-hydroxyclarithromycin, an active metabolite of clarithromycin, was compared for antimicrobial activity alone and in combination with the parent compound. the 14-hydroxyclarithromycin potency was comparable to that of clarithromycin, but was more active against haemophilus influenzae (mic50, 1 microgram/ml). combination mics at pharmacokinetic ratios produced end points equal to the most  active component of the combination. however, checkerboard mics and kill-curve studies suggested enhanced interactive effects. partial synergy and additive interactions were demonstrated in 96% of strains tested with synergy (partial) most often observed among the enterococcus faecalis, h. influenzae, and staphylococci. to determine the best in vitro test methods for predicting the value of 14-hydroxyclarithromycin, combination disks or ratio mic tests may not be practical. a modification of the proposed clarithromycin-susceptible breakpoint (less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml) upward to less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml (greater than or equal to 14 mm) was suggested to recognize the additional activity contributed by the 14-hydroxy metabolite. this modification should be applied, limited to susceptibility tests of h. influenzae  and possibly the enterococci.

AB  == fenozan, an anti-burn preparation, was shown to have antimicrobial activity against freshly isolated clinical strains of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis, as well as against collection strains of the other gram-positive bacteria. the antimicrobial action of the preparation was possibly  due to impairment of permeability of the cytoplasmic membranes in the sensitive bacterial cells and their liberation of intracellular low molecular weight compounds to the environment. the membranolytic and minimum inhibitory concentrations of fenozan with respect to the sensitive bacterial cells were one  order of magnitude lower than the concentration stabilizing the membranes of animal cells in the treatment of burns. combination of the antioxidant and antimicrobial properties in fenozan was likely to provide its satisfactory therapeutic effect in the treatment of burn wounds.

AB  == the in vitro activity of sparfloxacin, a new difluorinated quinolone, was evaluated against 857 gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates and compared with those of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, fleroxacin, and lomefloxacin. the mic of sparfloxacin for 90% of the members of the family enterobacteriaceae tested was 0.5 microgram/ml (range, 0.06 to 4.0 micrograms/ml); only for members of the genera serratia, citrobacter, and providencia were mics above 1 microgram/ml. some 90% of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were inhibited by 8 micrograms of the drug per ml. the mics for 90% of staphylococcus spp. and enterococcus faecalis were 0.12 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. all (100%) streptococcus pneumoniae strains were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml. the inoculum size had little effect on either the mic or the mbc of sparfloxacin. an increase in the magnesium concentration from 1.1 to 8.4 mm increased the mic between 2 and 10 times, depending on the genus tested. sparfloxacin was less active at ph 5. the antibacterial activity of sparfloxacin  against gram-positive bacteria was generally higher than those of the quinolones  with which it was compared; against streptococcus pneumoniae, sparfloxacin was four- and eightfold more active than ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, respectively. the activity of sparfloxacin against gram-negative rods was generally comparable  to that of ciprofloxacin except against enterobacter and acinetobacter spp., pseudomonas cepacia, xanthomonas maltophilia, and alcaligenes and flavobacterium  spp., against which sparfloxacin was the most active quinolone.

TI  == a host factor absent from lactococcus lactis subspecies lactis mg1363 is required for conjugative transposition.
AB  == in matings between lactococcus lactis strains, the conjugative transposons tn916  and tn919 are found in the chromosome of the transconjugants in the same place as in the chromosome of the donor, indicating that no transposition has occurred. in agreement with this, the frequency of l. lactis transconjugants from intraspecies matings is the same whether the donor contains the wild-type form of the transposon or the mutant tn916-int1, which has an insertion in the transposon's integrase gene. however, in intergeneric crosses with bacillus subtilis or enterococcus faecalis donors, tn916 and tn919 transpose to different locations on the chromosome of the l. lactis transconjugants. moreover, tn916 and tn919 could  not be transferred by conjugation from l. lactis and b. subtilis, e. faecalis or  streptococcus pyogenes. this suggests that excision of these elements does not occur in l. lactis. when cloned into e. coli with adjacent chromosomal dna from l. lactis, the conjugative transposons were able to excise, transpose and promote conjugation. therefore, the inability of these elements to excise in l. lactis is not caused by a permanent structural alteration in the transposon. we conclude that l. lactis lacks a factor required for excision of conjugative transposons.

AB  == combinations of one of the new fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, temafloxacin or tosufloxacin) with a betalactam (amoxicillin, piperacillin, or imipenem) were tested in vitro using the checkboard method against 28 strains of streptococcus faecalis recovered in 1990 from a variety of specimens. no instance of antagonism (fic greater than 2) was recorded. effects of the two agents were usually additive (0.5 less than fic less than or equal to 1). an indifferent effect (1 less than fic less than or equal to 2) was seen in 32.1% of cases (9 strains) with the amoxicillin-tosufloxacin combination. synergy (fic less than or equal to 0.5) was uncommon with combinations including imipenem: effects were synergistic  for only three strains with imipenem and either ciprofloxacin or tosufloxacin and for six strains with the imipenem-temafloxacin combination. synergy was more common with combinations including ciprofloxacin and either piperacillin (10 strains, 35.7%) or amoxicillin (13 strains, 46.4%).

TI  == internal mammary artery use. sternal revascularization and experimental infection patterns.
AB  == we have described previously the acute sternal devascularization produced by mobilization of one or both internal mammary arteries (imas). the present experiments were conducted to examine the time course of sternal revascularization and infection patterns after ima use. twenty-four 8-week-old domestic pigs were obtained from a herd in which active streptococcus faecalis had been detected in recent litters. after control blood flow procedures (microspheres) were completed, each pig underwent a median sternotomy; one or both imas were mobilized as a pedicle, and the sternotomy was repaired. repeat blood flow determinations were made in half the pigs at 1 week and in the remainder after 2 weeks. the pigs were killed, the wound was examined, cultures were taken as indicated, and tissue was harvested for blood flow analysis. despite the retention of an intact ima on the contralateral side, persistent, significant sternal ischemia existed 2 weeks after repair. however, when both imas were used, the extent of devascularization was exaggerated, and revascularization was impaired further. revascularization of intercostal muscle occurred more rapidly and was essentially returned to normal 2 weeks after sternotomy and ima harvest. active mediastinitis with erosion of the sternum was  found in one (17%) of six pigs at 1 week and in four (67%) of six pigs at 2 weeks when the imas had been rotated bilaterally. no wound infections were detected in  the single ima resection group. these data suggest that bilateral ima mobilization may delay an already slow revascularization process and predispose to infectious complications.

AB  == the crystal structure of nadh peroxidase (ec 1.11.1.1) from streptococcus faecalis 10c1 (enterococcus faecalis) has been refined to a resolution of 2.16 a  using the simulated annealing method. the final crystallographic r-factor is 17.7% for all data in the resolution range 7 to 2.16 a. the standard deviations are 0.015 a in bond lengths and 3.0 degrees in bond angles for the final model, which includes all 447 amino acid residues, one fad and 369 water molecules. the  enzyme is a symmetrical tetramer with point group d2; the symmetry is crystallographic. the redox center of the enzyme consists of fad and a cysteine (cys42), which forms a sulfenic acid (cys-soh) in its oxidized state. a histidine (his10) close to cys42 is likely to act as an active-site base. in the analyzed crystal, the enzyme was in a non-native oxidation state with cys42 oxidized to a  sulfonic acid cys-so3h. the chain fold of nadh peroxidase is similar to those of  disulfide oxidoreductases. a comparison with glutathione reductase, a representative of this enzyme family, is given.

TI  == cloning, sequence and overexpression of nadh peroxidase from streptococcus faecalis 10c1. structural relationship with the flavoprotein disulfide reductases.
AB  == dna fragments encoding streptococcal nadh peroxidase (npxase) have been amplified, cloned and sequenced from the genome of streptococcus (enterococcus) faecalis 10c1 (atcc 11700). the npxase gene (npr) comprises 1341 base-pairs and is preceded by a typical ribosome binding site. upstream from the structural gene, putative -10 and -35 promoter regions have been identified, as has a possible factor-independent terminator that occurs in 3'-flanking sequences. the  deduced relative molecular mass (mr = 49,551), amino acid composition and isoelectric point of npxase are in good agreement with previous values obtained with the purified enzyme. in addition, three sequenced peptides totaling approximately 20% of the protein were located in the npr gene product. from the sequencing data the deduced npxase sequence shares low but significant homology with the flavoprotein disulfide reductase class of enzymes ranging from 21% for glutathione reductase (grase) to 28% for thioredoxin reductase. alignment of npxase to escherichia coli grase allowed the identification of three previously reported fingerprints for the fad, nadp+ and central domains of grase, in the peroxidase sequence. in addition, cys42 of npxase, which is present as an unusual stabilized cysteine-sulfenic acid in the oxidized enzyme, aligns favorably with the charge-transfer cysteine in e. coli grase, and both residues closely follow fad-binding folds found near their respective amino termini. such sequence characteristics can also be seen in mercuric reductase, lipoamide dehydrogenase and trypanothione reductase, suggesting that all these enzymes may have originally diverged from a common ancestor. sequences that are on average 50% identical with three previously reported peptides of the related streptococcal nadh oxidase were also identified in the npxase primary structure, suggesting a strong similarity between these flavoenzymes. using the e. coli phage t7 expression system the npr gene has now been overexpressed in an e. coli genetic background. the resultant overexpressing clone produced a recombinant npxase that was catalytically active and immunoreactive to npxase antisera.

TI  == salivary-agglutinin-mediated adherence of streptococcus mutans to early plaque bacteria.
AB  == interspecies binding is important in the colonization of the oral cavity by bacteria. streptococcus mutans can adhere to other plaque bacteria, such as streptococcus sanguis and actinomyces viscosus, and this adherence is enhanced by saliva. the salivary and bacterial molecules that mediate this interaction were investigated. salivary agglutinin, a mucinlike glycoprotein known to mediate the  aggregation of many oral streptococci in vitro, was found to mediate the adherence of s. mutans to s. sanguis or a. viscosus. adherence of s. mutans to saliva- or agglutinin-coated s. sanguis and a. viscosus was inhibited by antibodies to the bacterial agglutinin receptor. expression of the s. sanguis receptor (ssp-5) gene in enterococcus faecalis increased adhesion of this organism to saliva- or agglutinin-coated s. sanguis and a. viscosus. this interaction could be inhibited by antibodies to the agglutinin receptor. the results suggest that salivary agglutinin can promote adherence of s. mutans to s. sanguis and a. viscosus through interactions with the agglutinin receptor on s. mutans.

AB  == in order to survey antibacterial activities of ofloxacin (oflx) against 1,440 bacterial strains isolated from patients with community-acquired infections in 1987 and 1990, minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of the drug as well as those of other new quinolones and oral cephems were determined. the following conclusions were reached. 1. comparison of the mic distribution for strains isolated in 1987 with those in 1990 suggested a tendency toward an increase in the frequency of oflx-resistant isolates with the passage of time of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella ssp., enterobacter spp., proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. most common elevations of mic  values against these bacteria were observed in mic80 and mic90 values, while no significant alteration was observed in mic50 values. however, mic50's of oflx against serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa were relatively high for strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. most of the oflx-resistant strains of s.  aureus seemed to be methicillin-resistant (mrsa). furthermore, mic80 of oflx against coagulase-negative staphylococci was high in strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. 2. susceptibility of streptococcus spp. was evaluated only in strains isolated in 1990. the results were comparable to those reported by others in the early 1980s. 3. bacteria which showed no or infrequent emergence of oflx-resistant strains even in 1990 were proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, campylobacter spp. and peptostreptococcus spp. 4. recently isolated strains from patients with community-acquired infections showed a tendency toward an increase of the frequency of oflx-resistant strains among many bacteria. however, the bacteria which contained high percentages of oflx-resistant strains except for mrsa were so-called less-virulent bacteria, and in the other bacteria elevations of mic values were only observed in mic80 and mic90. these results suggested that oflx preserved a potent antibacterial activity against bacteria which were major causative pathogens in community-acquired infections.

AB  == the sensitivity of four different enrichment procedures to detect listeria monocytogenes in the presence of high levels of streptococcus faecalis was investigated. defined mixed cultures of strep. faecalis and l. monocytogenes gave better results with one-stage enrichment techniques. for manure samples, however, two-stage enrichment techniques gave the best performance. the so-called cold enrichment techniques were found to be unsatisfactory for samples from natural environments. the following materials were examined for the presence of l. monocytogenes: fresh pig faeces (16% positive), fresh cattle faeces (20% positive), stored liquid manure (0% positive), manured soil samples (0% positive) and ground water samples (5% positive). after 3 weeks of storage l. monocytogenes could be detected in only one of the initially nine positive fresh faeces samples. two months after inoculation of stored liquid pig manure, stored liquid  cattle manure and soil with l. monocytogenes, this bacterium could not be traced  in any of these materials. radishes (raphanus sativus) and carrots (daucus carota), sown in soil inoculated with l. monocytogenes, were gathered after 3 months and examined for the presence of l. monocytogenes. three of six radish samples were found to be positive. remarkably, however, all carrot samples (six)  were free of l. monocytogenes.

AB  == chickens were selectively bred for either high-antibody (ha) or low-antibody (la) response to sheep erythrocytes. from 6 to 31 days after streptococcus faecalis challenge exposure, la-line chickens maintained a greater percentage of the prechallenge-exposure body weight and had lower heterophil-to-lymphocyte ratio than did ha-line chickens. the optimal dose of corticosterone (30 mg/kg of feed)  was effective in maintaining postchallenge-exposure body weight greater than that of controls. ampicillin (20 mg/d) alone was ineffective in almost all experiments. treatment with 30 mg of corticosterone/kg of feed plus ampicillin resulted in increased body weight response to s faecalis infection when treatment was initiated 1 day before or 2 days after challenge exposure. treatment with corticosterone was more effective in ha- than in la-line chickens. treatment before challenge exposure was more effective than treatment 2 days after challenge exposure.

TI  == relationship of the chemical structure and immunobiological activities of lipoteichoic acid from streptococcus faecalis (enterococcus hirae) atcc 9790.
AB  == two molecular species of lipoteichoic acid (lta 1 and lta 2) were isolated from whole cells of streptococcus faecalis (enterococcus hirae) atcc 9790 by hydrophobic chromatography on octyl sepharose cl-4b. chemical analysis revealed that lta 1 and lta 2 contained two and four acyl lipid anchors respectively. lta  1 was less active than lta 2 in inducing cytokines, except interleukin-1 (il-1),  but their in vivo antitumour effects were similar. lta 2 was a potent inducer of  tumour necrosis factor (tnf) and interferon (ifn) production and had excellent antitumour activity against meth a fibrosarcoma established in mice. deacylation  of lta 2 by alkaline hydrolysis abolished these biological activities. the phosphatidylglycolipid fraction derived from lta 2 after acid hydrolysis could also induce tnf, ifn, and il-1 production, as well as having antitumour activity  against meth a fibrosarcoma. therefore, the lipid anchor portion of s. faecalis lta may play an important role in the manifestation of these various biological activities.

TI  == differentiation of enterococci from other group d streptococci by means of a specific monoclonal antibody.
AB  == we report on the specificity of a monoclonal antibody which reacts with autoclaved extracts of four species of enterococci but does not react to the same extent with similar extracts from two non-enterococcal group d streptococci. the  monoclonal antibody also reacts specifically with purified lipoteichoic acid from streptococcus faecalis but not significantly with purified lipoteichoic acid from the non-enterococcal species streptococcus bovis and streptococcus equinus. the specific antigen detected with this antibody could correlate with the definition  of the enterococcus subgroup of the streptococci which would provide further evidence that this sub-group is taxonomically distinct from the other group d streptococci.

TI  == distribution and purification of aspartate racemase in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the distribution of aspartate racemase (ec 5.1.1.13) in various kinds of bacteria demonstrated that the enzyme occurs in lactic acid bacteria, such as streptococcus species and lactobacillus species. the enzyme from streptococcus thermophilus iam10064 was more thermostable than that from streptococcus lactis iam1198 which contained the enzyme most abundantly among the lactic acid bacteria we examined here. we purified the enzyme about 3400-fold to homogeneity from cell-free extract of s. thermophilus, which is composed of two identical subunits with a molecular weight of 28,000 as a homodimer. the enzyme utilizes specifically aspartate as a substrate, but not alanine and glutamate. maximal reaction velocity was observed at 37 degrees c and around ph 8.0. the sequence of the nh2-terminal amino acids of the enzyme was determined to be met-glu-asn-phe-phe-ser-ile-leu-gly-xxx-met-gly-thr-met-ala-thr-glu-ser- phe-.

TI  == synergistic bactericidal activity of rat serum with vancomycin against enterococci.
AB  == animal models of infectious diseases may not predict clinical efficacy when species-related factors come into play. recently, unexpected bactericidal activity of vancomycin alone against enterococci was observed in a rat model of endocarditis. a factor or factors in rat serum, but not rabbit or human serum, enhanced in vitro killing by vancomycin in four of five clinical isolates of enterococci. bactericidal activity was maintained on dilution of rat serum to 5.0% and after exposure of serum to 56 degrees c for 30 min. activity was lost by heating at 60 degrees c for 2 h, ultrafiltration, or absorption with bentonite or heat-killed bacteria. rat serum appears to contain a factor or factors that contribute bactericidal activity to vancomycin, a drug normally bacteriostatic for these enterococci. the mechanism by which this factor enhances killing of enterococci by vancomycin is unknown.

TI  == bacteriolytic effect of teicoplanin.
AB  == the glycopeptide antibiotic teicoplanin belongs to the same group as vancomycin and ristocetin and is a valuable tool for studying the autolytic system of sensitive gram-positive bacteria. teicoplanin, at a concentration of 1 microgram  ml-1, caused rapid lysis of exponential phase cells of streptococcus faecalis. bacillus spp. were most sensitive to the antibiotic; effective lysis occurred at  0.1 microgram teicoplanin ml-1. the bacteriolytic effect depended on the antibiotic concentration, the growth phase and growth rate of the target organism. antibiotic added to overnight cultures did not cause lysis. mg2+ (50 mm) was unable to prevent lysis. mutants with decreased autolytic activity were more resistant to teicoplanin and lysed more slowly than the wild-type. growth of bacteria in slightly acidic medium protected the cells against the lytic effect of teicoplanin typically observed at ph 7 or 8. this ph-dependent antibiotic tolerance was demonstrated with both bacilli and streptococci. bacterial lysis was prevented by the presence of ac-l-lys(ac)-d-ala-d-ala and normal growth was observed when this peptide was added simultaneously with teicoplanin. bacteria pretreated with teicoplanin, washed and transferred to fresh medium or buffers behaved as if the antibiotic was still present; in neutral or slightly alkaline conditions strong lysis occurred, whereas in acidic buffer only bacteriostasis was observed. in contrast to vancomycin, teicoplanin induced some lysis of bacteria in hypertonic media, presumably by affecting the integrity of the cell membrane.

TI  == chemical mechanism and rate-limiting steps in the reaction catalyzed by streptococcus faecalis nadh peroxidase.
AB  == the ph dependence of the kinetic parameters v, v/knadh, and v/kh2o2 has been determined for the flavoenzyme nadh peroxidase. both v/knadh and v/kh2o2 decrease as groups exhibiting pk's of 9.2 and 9.9, respectively, are deprotonated. the v profile decreases by a factor of 5 as a group exhibiting a pk of 7.2 is deprotonated. primary deuterium kinetic isotope effects on nadh oxidation are observed on v only, and the magnitude of dv is independent of h2o2 concentration  at ph 7.5. dv/knadh is ph independent and equal to 1.0 between ph 6 and ph 9.5, but dv is ph dependent, decreasing from a value of 7.2 at ph 5.5 to 1.9 at ph 9.5. the shape of the dv versus ph profile parallels that observed in the v profile and yields a similar pk of 6.6 for the group whose deprotonation decreases dv. solvent kinetic isotope effects obtained with nadh or reduced nicotinamide hypoxanthine dinucleotide as the variable substrate are observed on  v only, while equivalent solvent kinetic isotope effects on v and v/k are observed when h2o2 is used as the variable substrate. in all cases linear proton  inventories are observed. primary deuterium kinetic isotope effects on v for nadh oxidation decrease as the solvent isotopic composition is changed from h2o to d2o. these data are consistent with a change in the rate-limiting step from a step in the reductive half-reaction at low ph to a step in the oxidative half-reaction at high ph. analysis of the multiple kinetic isotope effect data suggests that at high d2o concentrations the rate of a single proton transfer step in the oxidative half-reaction is slowed. these data are used to propose a chemical mechanism involving the ph-dependent protonation of a flavin hydroxide anion, following flavin peroxide bond cleavage.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activities of pd 131628, a new 1,8-naphthyridine anti-infective agent.
AB  == pd 131628 is a new aminopyrrolidine-substituted fluorocyclopropyl naphthyridine quinolone which possesses high in vitro activity against a wide spectrum of bacterial species. the mics for greater than or equal to 90% of strains were 0.125 to 0.25 microgram/ml for staphylococci, streptococcus pyogenes, and s. pneumoniae; 0.5 micrograms/ml for s. agalactiae and enterococcus faecalis; 0.125  micrograms/ml for members of the family enterobacteriaceae and acinetobacter spp.; 0.5 micrograms/ml for pseudomonas aeruginosa; and less than or equal to 0.03 micrograms/ml for haemophilus influenzae, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae. in these in vitro comparisons with ciprofloxacin, pd 131628 is more active against gram-positive organisms, approximately equivalent against gram-negative organisms, and, like most other quinolones, relatively inactive against gram-negative anaerobes. in most instances, the in vitro potency of pd 131628 exceeded those of widely used compounds: ciprofloxacin, imipenem, ampicillin, penicillin g, oxacillin, cefazolin, ceftazidime, cefoxitin, cefsulodin, aztreonam, piperacillin, amikacin, spectinomycin, doxycycline, erythromycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin.

TI  == isolation of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in haematologic patients.
AB  == after the occurrence of septicaemia with a vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis strain in a patient, it was decided to determine the number of carriers  of vancomycin-resistant cocci among haematologic patients. during a period of six months 135 stool samples from 25 children, and 400 samples from 70 adults were studied. all samples from the children were negative for vancomycin-resistant cocci. nine of the adult patients had cultures positive for cocci, all identified as enterococci, which were highly resistant to vancomycin (mic greater than 250 micrograms/ml), sensitive to amoxicillin, moderately resistant to gentamicin, slightly resistant to teicoplanin, and sensitive to daptomycin. none of these patients had been given vancomycin prior to the isolation of the vancomycin-resistant enterococci.

TI  == inactivation of metronidazole by enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == the in-vitro inactivation of metronidazole by different clinical isolates of enterococcus faecalis was investigated by means of association experiments in which ent. faecalis strains and bacteroides fragilis group strains were cultured  in the same liquid medium. all of the tested ent. faecalis strains (20 isolates)  were able to protect the b. fragilis group strains against the killing effect of  metronidazole at a concentration four or eight times higher than the normal mic.  different strains of streptococcus (14), staphylococcus aureus (10), staph, epidermidis (10) and escherichia coli (8) failed to exhibit the same effect. when ent. faecalis strains were cultured anaerobically for 24 h in the presence of 4 mg metronidazole/l, either alone or together with different b. fragilis group strains, no metronidazole could be detected subsequently in the culture supernatants by hplc. concomitantly an increase of four or five logs in the viable counts of the co-cultured bacteroides strains was observed compared with bacteroides strains cultured alone. sonicated cell extracts of ent. faecalis cultured either aerobically or anaerobically were found to inactivate metronidazole to the same extent, whereas the culture supernatants had no such effect.

TI  == identification of a region that influences host range of the streptococcal conjugative plasmid pip501.
AB  == pip501 is a member of a group of conjugative plasmids that are self-transmissible to a wide variety of streptococci as well as to other gram-positive bacteria. several pip501 restriction fragment deletion derivatives have been isolated and characterized. in this paper we describe one such derivative (pva1702) which was  conjugally proficient but had a limited host range. the loss of host range ability was seen as decreased conjugal transfer from enterococcus faecalis to streptococcus sanguis and was coincident with the deletion of a 4.5-kb dna fragment. transformation of pva1702 into s. sanguis also was dramatically reduced as compared to its progenitor, suggesting the 4.5-kb fragment encoded a factor(s) necessary for stable maintenance in this host but not in e. faecalis. these observations suggest that pip501 employs specific mechanisms enabling its maintenance in certain gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == [comparative studies of the filtration behavior of bacteria and organic particles in porous groundwater conductors. fundamentals and methods].
AB  == in subsurface aquatic environments two groups of micro-organisms are observed: allochthonous bacteria and viruses, which as contaminants are eliminated from water after some time, and autochthonous groundwater micro-organisms, which belong to the natural subsurface environment and may reach very high abundances under favourable conditions--especially in the presence of a high nutrient supply. the migration of micro-organisms is controlled by flow length dependent transport processes (advection--dispersion, adsorption--desorption), and predominantly by filtration. this can be described on the basis of an expanded advection--dispersion concept. the filter effects in a certain porous aquifer can be quantified by the filter efficiency (filter factor) as a measure of the specific decrease of an initial concentration on a certain flow length. recent laboratory experiments show that for sand the filter factor depends on the respective microbial species and is highly correlated to the effective grain diameter of the porous material, which is routinely determined in hydrogeology. experiments with columns filled with quartz sand using the bacteria species escherichia coli atcc 11229, pseudomonas cepacia dsm 50181, streptococcus faecalis atcc 6569, and polystyrene beads with similar density and diameters show that the filter factor is controlled by the grain size of filter material, the flow velocity, the diameter of the particle and the ionic strength of the water:  the filter factor is specific for each microbial species for the same conditions  of the aquatic environment. the filter factor decreases one order of magnitude if the flow velocity increases in the same order. a major control of the filter factor is the grain size. conventionally the grain size is used as characteristic length instead of the pore size which, although it should be the real reference date, is relatively difficult to measure. for the assessment of the filter factor, the grain size d10, taken from the grain size distribution curve, can be  used. the influence of the particle diameter on the filter factor, which was predicted by the filtration theory, was confirmed. the minimum values of the filter factor were encountered at particle diameters of about 1 micron, which is  about the size of bacteria. the filter factor is influenced strongly by the ionic strength in water with low ionic strength, whereas in water of higher ionic strength its influence can be neglected. these relationships can be formulated into empirical equations, which allow prediction of the filter factor for given hydraulic conditions.

TI  == influence of bacteria on clostridium perfringens infections in young chickens.
AB  == when monoflora chickens with lactobacillus acidophilus or streptococcus faecalis  were inoculated with clostridium perfringens either in broth culture or resuspended in gifu anaerobic medium broth or supernatant fluid, few or no chickens died. approximately 50% of germ-free chickens died after inoculation of  c. perfringens culture, whereas no conventional birds died after inoculation of broth culture. c. perfringens in the contents of duodenum from germ-free chickens numbered about 10(4) colony-forming units (cfu)/g after inoculation 10(8) cfu broth culture per bird, but in gnotobiotic and conventional chickens this organism decreased or was not detected. when c. perfringens was cultured in intestinal contents collected from germ-free chickens, c. perfringens proliferated but alpha toxin was not detected. these findings indicate that the pathogenicity of c. perfringens was suppressed by l. acidophilus or s. faecalis administered previously or inhibited by normal intestinal flora.

TI  == [isolated tricuspid endocarditis. apropos of a case caused by streptococcus d bovis and faecalis occurring after coloscopy].
AB  == a 59-year-old chronic alcoholic male, with no cardiac past history, was hospitalised with septicemia 5 months after the endoscopic removal of 2 benign intestinal polyps. the diagnosis of tricuspid endocarditis was possible only 2 months later on the basis of echocardiography requested because of the onset of a tricuspid systolic murmur. blood cultures revealed the presence in succession of  streptococcus d fecalis then bovis. antibiotics, changed several times because of the onset of complications (allergy, agranulocytosis), failed to deal with the problem of infection as shown by the development of several septic pulmonary emboli which finally resulted in total tricuspidectomy with neither immediate nor secondary valve replacement. the authors use this clinical case to review the characteristics of tricuspid endocarditis, the incidence of which is on the increase in certain etiological contexts (staphylococcal endocarditis in drug addicts or secondary to central vascular lines). they stress that the clinical picture is often confusing since the murmur of tricuspid incompetence is absent in 2/3 of cases. echocardiography must therefore be requested routinely in all septicemias, thus enabling earlier diagnosis and assessment of the risk of pulmonary embolism (risk if vegetation greater than 10 mm). the nature of the organism responsible may be suggestive of certain etiologies. thus malignant disease of the colon should be sought if the bacterium is a streptococcus d bovis. apart from antibiotics, treatment must include effective anticoagulation to decrease the risk of embolic recurrence.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == comparative antimicrobial activity of ceftibuten against multiply-resistant microorganisms from belgium.
AB  == to study the activity of ceftibuten, we obtained multiply-resistant isolates from approximately 20 hospitals in belgium. against enterobacteriaceae, all of the tested comparative compounds were more active than cefaclor, and ceftibuten and tigemonam were the most active of the agents tested. ceftibuten mic50s were less  than or equal to 1 microgram/ml for most enteric bacilli species and 85% of strains were susceptible (less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml). this level of activity compared favorably to that recorded for cefaclor (less than or equal to  8 micrograms/ml), cefetamet (less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml), and cefteram (less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml), that is, 37%, 69%, and 59%, respectively. ceftibuten, cefetamet, cefteram, and tigemonam were highly active against isolates of haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae. none of the comparative agents were as active as cefaclor against staphylococcal isolates. against streptococci, cefteram was the most active, and tigemonam the least active of the agents. the mic90s of ceftibuten for strains of streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes were 2 micrograms/ml and 0.5 microgram/ml,  respectively. strains of streptococcus agalactiae were resistant to both ceftibuten and tigemonam; cefaclor and cefteram inhibited 100% of isolates of this species. strains of enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa were consistently resistant to all of the compounds. overall, ceftibuten exhibited potent activity against many multiply-resistant clinical isolates.

TI  == natural transfer of conjugative transposon tn916 between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the conjugative streptococcal transposon tn916 was found to transfer naturally between a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative eubacteria. enterococcus faecalis hosting the transposon could serve as a donor for alcaligenes eutrophus, citrobacter freundii, and escherichia coli at frequencies of 10(-6) to 10(-8). no transfer was observed with several phototrophic species. mating of an e. coli strain carrying tn916 yielded transconjugants with bacillus subtilis, clostridium acetobutylicum, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus lactis subsp. diacetylactis at frequencies of 10(-4) to 10(-6). acetobacterium woodii was the only gram-positive organism tested that did not accept the transposon from a gram-negative donor. the results prove the ability of conjugative transposable elements such as tn916 for natural cross-species gene transfer, thus potentially  contributing to bacterial evolution.

AB  == evaluation of homologous regions of published m protein (emm) gene sequences from group a streptococci (gas; streptococcus pyogenes) was used to design three primer pairs for polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and three oligonucleotide probe  sequences internal to the amplified products. one set of primers and corresponding probe should detect and lead to amplification of emm(-like) genes of virtually every type ("all m"), another ("sor-m") should only amplify emm(-like) genes from gas negative for serum opacity reaction (sor) and the third ("sor+ m") should expand only emm(-like) genes from sor+ gas. using the "allm" primer pair for pcr on the genomic dna from gas of 29 different m types as well as from a group c and a group g streptococcal isolate, dna fragments within the expected size range were amplified in every assay. all pcr products reacted with  the "allm" probe. related sequences were not detected in genomic dna of an s. agalactiae and an enterococcus faecalis isolate. applying the "sor-m" and "sor+m" primers to identical assays led to mutually exclusive amplification products. the "sor-m" and "sor+m" probes hybridized only to their corresponding products. exceptions to this exclusivity were the sor- gas of m types 3, 8, 27, 34, 42, 67, and 69, which consistently reacted only with the "sor+m" primer/probe set. analysis of sequence data from the amplified emm(-like) 2, 3, 18, and 19 genes revealed interesting specific features such as conserved gaps in the c-terminal sequence regions from sor+ and the exceptional sor- gas strains. these data indicate the existence of a subgroup of strains among sor- gas and may advance our understanding of phylogenetic relationship between different serotypes of gas.

TI  == in vitro activity of ly264826, a new glycopeptide antibiotic, against gram-positive bacteria isolated from patients with cancer.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ly264826, a novel glycopeptide antibiotic produced by amycolatopsis orientalis, was compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and oxacillin against 311 gram-positive clinical isolates from patients with cancer,  ly264826 had lower mics for 90% of isolates (mic90) than vancomycin for all species tested. it was active against oxacillin-resistant isolates including staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml), staphylococcus haemolyticus (mic90, 2.0 micrograms/ml), enterococcus spp. (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml), bacillus cereus (mic90, 0.25 micrograms/ml), and corynebacterium jeikeium (mic90, 0.12 micrograms/ml). for s. aureus, including oxacillin-resistant isolates, the mics of ly264826 were similar to those of teicoplanin. for coagulase-negative staphylococci, however, ly264826 had mics that were 4- to 32-fold lower than those of teicoplanin. against most streptococcal species the activities of ly264826 and teicoplanin were similar. bactericidal activity against staphylococcus spp. and most streptococcus pyogenes isolates was less than or equal to 1 dilution of the mic. one isolate of s. pyogenes and all enterococcus faecalis strains tested were tolerant of ly264826, with mbcs greater than or equal to 32-fold greater than the mics. the addition of 50% human serum resulted  in a significant increase in activity only against staphylococcus epidermidis. variations in ph from 6.4 to 8.4 and in inoculum from 10(3) to 10(7) cfu/ml did not significantly affect the activity of ly264826.

TI  == enterococcus faecalis and otitis media with effusion. how to treat.
AB  == although microorganisms are cultured in only one out of 3 middle ear effusions, viable and non-viable bacteria are presumed to be responsible in part for otitis  media with effusion (ome). because of this association, antibiotics in sublethal, bacteriostatic, or bacteriocidal concentrations are frequently used as non-surgical therapy for ome. antibiotic treatment is predicated on the assumption that microorganisms responsible for ome are the same ones which produce acute otitis media. this may not always be the case. enterococcus faecalis (formerly known as beta-hemolytic group d streptococcus) was isolated in pure culture from 3 middle ears of two patients with ome. the significance of the isolation of this bacteria, an enteric organism which is infrequently found in upper respiratory tracts, is its lack of susceptibility to the usually prescribed oral antibiotics. in each of the children, failure to respond to antibiotics led  to tympanocentesis and culture followed by middle ear drainage with insertion of  middle ear ventilating tubes. unless intravenous antibiotics are used, surgical drainage should be the procedure of choice when e. faecalis is found in the middle ear.

TI  == studies of the subgingival microflora in patients with acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome.
AB  == two unique forms of periodontal disease, hiv-gingivitis and hiv-periodontitis, have been described in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids). in order to determine the bacterial species associated with periodontitis in aids patients, the predominant cultivable microflora was examined in 21 subgingival plaque samples from 11 aids patients with periodontitis. the presence of putative periodontal pathogens including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides intermedius, porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly b. gingivalis), and wolinella recta was examined by immunofluorescence in 128 subgingival dental plaque samples from 50 aids patients including 32 patients with periodontitis. of 666 bacterial  strains isolated from the 21 subgingival plaque samples, streptococcus sanguis ii was the most frequently recovered species comprising 18.5% of the total number of isolates followed by lactobacillus acidophilus (12.2%), porphyromonas gingivalis  (12%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.4%), staphylococcus epidermidis (8.7%), actinomyces naeslundii (7.5%), and actinomyces viscosus (4.7%). fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent species and was found in 76% of the sites and 91% of the patients. enteric species including enterococcus avium and enterococcus faecalis, clostridium clostridiiforme and clostridium difficle as well as klebsiella pneumoniae also were recovered. immunofluorescence assays detected similar carriage rates of a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. intermedius, and  p. gingivalis in both gingivitis patients and periodontitis patients, while four  times more periodontitis patients demonstrated w. recta. subgingival yeast was a  frequent finding in these aids patients, present in 62% of the subjects and 55% of the sites. this study indicates that subgingival plaque in aids patients with  periodontitis can harbor high proportions of the same periodontal pathogens as are associated with periodontitis in non-hiv infected subjects as well as high proportions of opportunistic pathogens.

TI  == comparative kinetics of hematoporphyrin derivative uptake and susceptibility of bacillus subtilis and streptococcus faecalis to photodynamic action.
AB  == hematoporphyrin derivative (hpd) is widely used in photoradiation therapy of tumors and other diseases, and has been shown to affect the viability of gram positive bacteria. this investigation assessed the efficiency of binding of hpd to bacillus subtilis and streptococcus faecalis when hpd-treated organisms were exposed to red light. kinetic studies indicated that the amount of hpd bound increased with increasing external concentration of hpd until saturation of binding sites was reached. s. faecalis had a higher affinity for hpd and was more susceptible to photoinactivation than b. subtilis. the data from this study suggest that differences in susceptibility of microorganisms to photoinactivation are directly related to the affinity of each strain for hpd.

TI  == some features of the streptococcus faecalis na(+)-atpase resemble those of the vacuolar-type atpases.
AB  == in the ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta) extract prepared from the membranes of streptococcus faecalis, we found the 330-kda protein that was coordinately increased with the induction of na(+)-atpase. it was missed in the edta extract of nak1, a mutant defective in the na(+)-atpase, but restored in that of its revertant, nak1r. the 330-kda protein showed the atp hydrolytic activity by active staining, and mainly consisted of the polypeptides of 73 kda, 52 kda and possibly 38 kda. in addition, the na(+)-stimulated atpase of the membranes was sensitive to both nitrate and n-ethylmaleimide, inhibitors for the vacuolar h(+)-atpase. thus, the na(+)-atpase of this organism has a structure similar to vacuolar h(+)-atpase.

TI  == release of the component of streptococcus faecalis na(+)-atpase from the membranes.
AB  == the na(+)-stimulated atpase activity of streptococcus faecalis was lost by washing the membranes with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta). atpase activities of both the edta extract and the stripped membranes did not show any stimulation by na+ ions. however, the na(+)-stimulated atpase was readily reconstituted by an incubation of these fractions combined. it was only reconstituted from the fractions prepared under the condition that the na(+)-atpase is amplified, and not from those boiled or digested by trypsin. thus, the component of na(+)-atpase of this organism is capable of being released from the membranes.

TI  == high-level gentamicin resistance in enterococcus: microbiology, genetic basis, and epidemiology.
AB  == antibiotic resistance is an ever-increasing problem in enterococci. these bacteria are remarkable in their ability to acquire and disseminate antibiotic resistance genes by a variety of routes. since first described in 1979, high-level resistance to gentamicin (mic, greater than 2,000 micrograms/ml) has spread worldwide and has been responsible for serious infections. resistance is plasmid-mediated and due to aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes. high-level gentamicin resistance indicates that there will be no synergistic bactericidal activity with penicillin-gentamicin combinations. the epidemiology of nosocomial  enterococcal infections is remarkably similar to that of nosocomial infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci and by multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli. the most likely way these resistant bacteria are spread among hospital patients is via transient carriage on the hands of hospital personnel. patient-to-patient and interhospital transmission of strains has been  reported recently. however, clonal dissemination is not the cause of the increased frequency of resistant strains, since gentamicin resistance appears in  a variety of different conjugative and nonconjugative plasmids in enterococcus.

TI  == transferable plasmid-mediated antibiotic resistance in listeria monocytogenes.
AB  == a strain of listeria monocytogenes, isolated from a patient with meningoencephalitis, was resistant to chloramphenicol, erythromycin, streptomycin, and tetracycline. the genes conferring resistance to these antibiotics were carried by a 37-kb plasmid, pip811, that was self-transferable to other l monocytogenes cells, to enterococci-streptococci, and to staphylococcus aureus. the efficacy of transfer and the stability of pip811 were  higher in enterococci-streptococci than in the other gram-positive bacteria. as indicated by nucleic acid hybridisation, the genes in pip811 conferring resistance to chloramphenicol, erythromycin, and streptomycin were closely related to plasmid-borne determinants that are common in enterococci-streptococci. plasmid pip811 shared extensive sequence homology with  pam beta 1, the prototype broad host range resistance plasmid in these two groups of gram-positive cocci. these results suggest that emergence of multiple antibiotic resistance in listeria spp is due to acquisition of a replicon originating in enterococci-streptococci. the dissemination of resistance to other strains of l monocytogenes is likely.

AB  == polyclonal antisera prepared against the purified nadh peroxidase from streptococcus faecalis atcc 9790 (enterococcus hirae) do not cross-react with the atcc 11700 enzyme. comparative tryptic maps of the two proteins indicate that the differences in primary structures extend beyond those localized to respective antigenic epitopes. alignments of the nh2-terminal and active-site cysteinyl peptide sequences of the two streptococcal peroxidases reveal identities of 50 and 67% in the respective overlap regions. dithionite titrations of the atcc 9790 enzyme reveal a separation in potentials (e2 - e1) for the nonflavin and flavin redox centers of 39 mv, a value nearly 50 mv lower than that observed with the atcc 11700 peroxidase. despite these changes in redox behavior nadh titrations of the atcc 9790 enzyme give rise to both eh2 and eh2.nadh species as previously observed. the enzyme turnover number with hydrogen peroxide is approximately 60%  that of the atcc 11700 peroxidase; the atcc 9790 peroxidase is also inhibited during turnover with ethyl hydroperoxide. these findings suggest that the flavoprotein nadh peroxidases may exhibit greater diversity among the group d streptococci than previously observed with the widely distributed enzymes of the  related flavoprotein disulfide reductase class.

AB  == vancomycin-inducible proteins of 39.5 and 39 kda from respectively, low-level and high-level resistant enterococci were compared. electrophoretic, immunoblot and peptide analysis revealed three types of protein, one in a low-level resistant strain of e. faecium, one in 2 high-level-resistant strains of e. faecium, and one in a high-level resistant strain of e. faecalis. the inducible proteins of e. faecium and e. faecalis, of 39.5 and 39 kda respectively, which may function in a similar fashion (al-obeid et al. (1990) antimicrob. agents chemother. 34, 252-256), are not related immunologically.

TI  == [antibiotic prophylaxis with cefotiam in transurethral resection of the prostate].
AB  == over a period of 7 months, 50 patients underwent a trans-urethral resection of the prostate (turp), this intervention is classified as "clear-contamined". the antibiotic prophylactic protocol, the subject of this study, was the following: cefotiam 2 g iv with the induction of anesthesia, 1 g 3 hours later and 1 g iv with the removal of the urethral catheter. results: there were 3 early post-operative urinary tract infections, one of these patients was symptomatic, at the time of removal of the urethral catheter. most of these infections were due to enterococcus faecalis bacteria. there was 4 late post-operative symptomatic urinary tract infections at days 15, 20, 50, and 120 respectively. all these late infections were due to streptococcus faecalis. in total, there was a 10% rate of urinary tract infections in the critical 30 days period following the turp. all the blood cultures were negative. these results lead us to conclude that the short term preventive treatment using the cefotiam, cephalosporin which  has a strong prostatic tissue penetration, reduces the rate of post turp urinary  tract infections.

TI  == high-level chromosomal gentamicin resistance in streptococcus agalactiae (group b).
AB  == this is the first report of high-level gentamicin resistance in a group b streptococcus. strain b128 of serotype ii was isolated from an infected leg wound in 1987. b128 was resistant to high levels of gentamicin as well as of all other  available aminoglycosides and was also resistant to tetracyclines. no bactericidal synergism was found between ampicillin or vancomycin and any of these aminoglycosides. gentamicin, kanamycin, streptomycin, and tetracycline resistance determinants transferred by conjugation into a plasmid-free group b streptococcus recipient at a frequency of 10(-8) to 10(-9) transconjugants per donor cell. no transconjugants were detected when streptococci of groups a, c, and g, streptococcus sanguis, or enterococcus faecalis was used as a recipient. no plasmids were detected in b128 or in any of the four transconjugants tested. by dna-dna hybridization, homology was detected between gene aac6/aph2, of e. faecalis origin, and a 2.4-kilobase hindiii chromosomal fragment of b128; homology to the genes aph3 and aade, of e. faecalis origin, was found with hindiii chromosomal fragments of the same size (3.0 kilobases). strains like b128, which potentially can be responsible for severe neonatal infections, are of great clinical concern, since there are to date no antibiotic combinations exhibiting bactericidal synergism against them.

TI  == technologically important characteristics of enterococcus isolates from milk and  dairy products.
AB  == enterococcus faecium (54 strains), e. faecalis (40 strains), and e. durans (14) were isolated from various dairy products (raw milk, cream, butter and fermented  milk products) during a previous study (wessels et al., 1988). in this article various characteristics of these isolates, which may have a bearing on their significance in dairy products, have been studied. a large percentage of the identified strains of all three species were able to grow at 7 degrees c. seventy-six percent of the e. faecium strains, 62% e. faecalis and 50% e. durans  strains also showed proteolytic activity at psychrotrophic temperatures. the fact that proteolytic activity could be detected within 2 days at 7 degrees c is significant, since bulk cooled milk is normally held for 3 to 4 days at temperatures between 4 and 7 degrees c at farms or factories prior to processing. this examination confirmed that enterococci are proteolytic rather than lipolytic.

AB  == the conjugation mechanism of incp plasmids may be employed to mobilize small non-conjugative plasmids from escherichia coli to a wide range of different organisms. this strategy has been adapted for use with the gram-positive anaerobe, clostridium acetobutylicum ncib 8052. several shuttle vectors containing replicons from pam beta 1 (enterococcus faecalis), pcb101 (clostridium butyricum) or pwv01 (streptococcus cremoris), together with the cis-acting orit region of rk2, have been constructed, and transferred to and established in this  organism. one of the vectors apparently contains a hot spot for insertion of is1. conjugative mobilization of plasmids from e. coli will provide a useful alternative to electroporation for effecting gene transfer to this industrially important anaerobe.

TI  == coaggregation of streptococcus sanguis and other streptococci with candida albicans.
AB  == thirteen strains of viridans group streptococci and two strains of other streptococci were tested for coaggregation with candida albicans. streptococcus sanguis strains generally exhibited low levels of adherence to 28 degrees c-grown exponential-phase yeast cells, but starvation of yeast cells for glucose at 37 degrees c (or at 28 degrees c) increased their coaggregating activity with these  streptococci by at least tenfold. this was a property common to four c. albicans  strains tested, two of which were able to form mycelia (6406 and men) and two of  which were not (mm2002 and ca2). the expression of the coaggregation adhesin during yeast cell starvation was inhibited by addition of trichodermin or amphotericin b. the strains of s. sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus oralis tested for coaggregating activity encompassed a diverse range of physiological and morphological types, yet all exhibited saturable coaggregation with starved c. albicans cells. there was no correlation of cell surface hydrophobicity, of either yeast or streptococcal cells, with their abilities to coaggregate. strains of streptococcus anginosus also coaggregated with starved yeast cells; streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus pyogenes coaggregated to a lesser degree with c. albicans, and the coaggregation with s. pyogenes was not promoted by yeast cell starvation; streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis did not coaggregate with yeast. the coaggregation reactions of s. sanguis and s. gordonii with c. albicans were inhibited by edta and by heat or protease treatment of the yeast cells and were not reversible by the addition  of lactose or other simple sugars. these observations extend the range of intergeneric coaggregations that are known to occur between oral microbes and suggest that coaggregations of c. albicans with viridans group streptococci may be important for colonization of oral surfaces by the yeast.

AB  == trospectomycin (u-63366f), a 6'-propyl analogue of spectinomycin, was tested against aminoglycoside-resistant enterococci. the mic90 for enterococcus faecalis was 4 mg/l and that for e. faecium was 8 mg/l. trospectomycin alone was not bactericidal for enterococci, with mbc90 4096 mg/l for both e. faecalis and e. faecium. the addition of commercially available polyvalent immunoglobulin decreased significantly both the mics and the mbcs and the rendered trospectomycin bactericidal for enterococci. chequerboard titration of a combination of trospectomycin with ampicillin revealed an fic index of 1.0 for all the isolates tested. time-kill curves also did not show any enhancement of bactericidal activity of ampicillin when combined with trospectomycin. a combination of ampicillin and gentamicin was synergistic for enterococci under similar experimental conditions. trospectomycin can be used as a safe alternative to aminoglycosides or beta-lactam antibiotics in enterococcal infection where bactericidal activity is not required, or in the event of serious side effects from these two classes of antibiotics.

TI  == genetic functions and cell-cell interactions in the pheromone-inducible plasmid transfer system of enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == pheromone-inducible plasmid transfer is a novel form of bacterial conjugation which has, to date, been observed only in enterococcus (streptococcus) faecalis.  this process includes several important stages of interaction between the donor and recipient cell. the initial interaction is the transmission of a chemical signal from the recipient to the donor cell. recent evidence has shown that the signal is in the form of a small hydrophobic peptide, which is capable of inducing a complex mating response in the donor cell at concentrations as low as  1-5 molecules per responder cell. most e. faecalis strains produce multiple pheromones, each of which induces a response only in cells carrying a particular  plasmid (or member of a family of related plasmids). genetic functions ascribed to the pheromone response include: (i) cell-cell aggregation, which promotes initial close contact between mating cells; (ii) surface exclusion, which prevents plasmid transfer between aggregated donor cells; and (iii) highly efficient dna transfer, which requires other unidentified functions in addition to aggregation. the first two processes appear to be mediated by proteinaceous surface antigens.

TI  == biological characterization of a new radioactive labeling reagent for bacterial penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  == radiolabeled penicillin g is widely used as the imaging agent in penicillin-binding protein (pbp) assays. the disadvantages of most forms of labeled penicillin g are instability on storage and the long exposure times usually required for autoradiography or fluorography of electrophoretic gels. we  investigated the utility of radioiodinated penicillin v as an alternative reagent. radioiodination of p-(trimethylstannyl)penicillin v with [125i]na, using a modification of the chloramine-t method, is simple, high yielding, and site specific. we demonstrated the general equivalence of commercially obtained [3h]penicillin g and locally synthesized [125i]penicillin v (ipv) in their recognition of bacterial pbps. profiles of pbps in membranes from bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, providencia rettgeri, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium labeled with ipv or [3h]penicillin g were virtually identical. use of ipv as the imaging  agent in competition experiments for determination of the affinities of various beta-lactam antibiotics for the pbps of e. coli yielded results similar to those  obtained in experiments with [3h]penicillin g. dried electrophoretic gels from typical pbp experiments, using ipv at 37.3 ci/mmol and 30 micrograms/ml, exposed  x-ray film in 8 to 24 h. the stability of ipv on storage at 4 degrees c was inversely proportional to specific activity. at 37.3 ci/mmol and 60 micrograms/ml, ipv retained useful activity for at least 60 days at 4 degrees c.  ipv represents a practical and stable reagent for rapid pbp assays.

AB  == lipoteichoic acid (lta) from streptococcus faecalis stimulates the respiratory burst in peripheral blood monocytes (mon), as measured by cytochrome c reduction. the effect of lta was time and dose dependent. lta stimulated the respiratory burst in a biphasic manner within a range of 1 to 1000 ng/ml.10(6) mon, with maximal activity at 50 ng/ml. at this concentration lta increased the activity from 0.97 +/- 0.2 to 4.88 +/- 0.2 nmol.10(6) mon/20 min. the role of calcium ions in the effect of lta in stimulating respiratory burst was studied by changing the availability of calcium ions in the medium, and by measuring the effect of lta on 45ca2+ uptake and on intracellular ca2+ levels. removal of extracellular calcium  ions in the presence of the calcium chelator egta, abolished the lta-stimulated respiratory burst. lta (50 ng/ml) was found to increase 45ca2+ uptake into monocytes within seconds (from 2200 +/- 242 in the untreated cells to 4642 +/- 365 cpm/min in the lta-treated mon). at this concentration, lta stimulated an immediate rise in the intracellular free ca2+ concentration to 155 +/- 15 nm as compared with 120 +/- 14 nm in the unstimulated monocytes. lta caused a specific  release of arachidonic acid indicating the involvement of phospholipase a2 in the transduction signal stimulating the respiratory burst by lta.

AB  == the complete nucleotide (nt) sequence of a 5.1-kb ecori dna restriction fragment  carrying the replication region of the streptococcus faecalis plasmid pam beta 1  has been determined. of the seven major open reading frames (orf a-g) identified  within this fragment, two (c and e) were shown to be encoding by in vitro transcription/translation assays. evidence was obtained that synthesis of the polypeptide (mr 57,380) encoded by the largest orf (e) was essential for replication. deletion analysis indicated that the minimum unit of dna required for replication resided on a 2.59-kb acci-hpai subfragment. orf c resided outside of this fragment and encompassed an extensive region of directly repeated nt sequence. the encoded polypeptide (mr 30,471) was therefore composed of large tracts of reiterated amino acid sequence (11 x vdp and 35 x tep tripeptides) which probably caused the observed anomalous electrophoretic mobility of the synthesised protein (equivalent to 61 kda). deletion of a 416-bp segment of dna between unique kpni and styi sites caused an increase in copy number, which correlated with the in vitro production of higher levels of orf e polypeptide. although homology was detected between the sequenced dna, and the replicon of a closely related streptococcal plasmid (psm19035), none was evident to any other characterised gram+ plasmid.

AB  == win 57273 is a new fluoroquinolone that has an expanded spectrum of activity against staphylococcus spp. (mic for 90% of isolates [mic90], 0.008 microgram/ml), enterococcus faecalis (mic90, 0.06 microgram/ml), bacillus spp. (mic90, 0.03 micrograms/ml), listeria monocytogenes (mic90, 0.06 microgram/ml), streptococcus spp. (mic90, 0.03 microgram/ml), and bacteroides fragilis group strains (mic90, 0.5 microgram/ml). like other fluoroquinolone compounds, win 57273 was active against members of the family enterobacteriaceae (97% of strains inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml), haemophilus, branhamella, and neisseria strains (100% susceptible), acinetobacter spp. (100% susceptible),  and pseudomonas aeruginosa (68% susceptible). we observed that win 57273 was very active against cephalosporin- or aminoglycoside-resistant gram-negative strains but shared cross-resistance with other fluoroquinolones. increasing inoculum concentrations had minimal effects on win 57273 mics, and the drug was considered to be bactericidal based on reference mbc and kill curve analyses. unlike most previously studied drugs in this class, win 57273 had increased activity (three-  to fourfold) at low ph. rates of mutation to win 57273 resistance at eight times  its mic were in the range of 5.6 x 10(-8) to greater than 1.4 x 10(-9). this new  compound possesses a wide potential spectrum of use, and it should be evaluated further by in vitro and in vivo studies.

TI  == genetic basis of tetracycline resistance in urogenital bacteria.
AB  == the distributions of the nucleotide sequences related to the tetracycline resistance determinants tet k, tet l, tet m, and tet o were studied by dot blot hybridization with randomly chosen clinical urogenital tract isolates of viridans group streptococci, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, gardnerella  vaginalis, lactobacillus spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus spp.,  and veillonella parvula. among the peptostreptococcus spp., 79% of the isolates hybridized with one (64%) or more (36%) of the probes for tet k (27%), tet l (30%), tet m (75%) and tet o (13%). of the viridans group streptococci, 82% of the strains hybridized with one (34%) or more (66%) of the four probes. the distribution of the four determinants in this group was as follows: tet k, 36%; tet l, 31%; tet m, 43%; tet o, 61%. twenty-nine percent of the enterococci and forty-six percent of the group b streptococci hybridized with the probes; however, the tet k, tet l, and tet o determinants were found in only a few strains, while the tet m determinant predominated. a total of 29% of the f. nucleatum isolates, 55% of the g. vaginalis isolates, and 26% of the v. parvula isolates hybridized with the tet m determinant. in contrast, 43% of the lactobacillus spp. hybridized with the tet o determinant. the data indicate that  tetracycline resistance determinants are common to many of the microorganisms isolated from the urogenital tract.

TI  == enterococcal resistance to vancomycin and related cyclic glycopeptide antibiotics.
AB  == enterococci belonging to various species resistant to vancomycin and related cyclic glycopeptide antibiotics have been isolated from hospitalized patients in  france, the uk and the usa. all such strains examined display inducible synthesis of a membrane protein associated with resistance. the mechanism by which the membrane protein acts has not been definitively established, but it may block the access of the antibiotic to its peptidoglycan target. that the protein could be a bypass enzyme has not been ruled out. transfer of glycopeptide resistance by conjugation to either enterococcus faecium or enterococcus faecalis and by transformation of streptococcus sanguis challis has been reported. the structural and regulatory genes encoding this resistance can be localized on plasmid and, apparently, chromosomal dna. the plasmids encoding this resistance appear to differ from each other and have variable host ranges, but share at least some dna sequence homology.

TI  == mechanisms of resistance of enterococci to beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == two mechanisms are responsible for resistance of enterococci to beta-lactam antibiotics: alterations of penicillin-binding proteins and production of a beta-lactamase. the latter has been found in a few clinical isolates of enterococcus faecalis, whereas the former appears to account for resistance in most strains. a correlation has been established between the amount of a particular penicillin-binding protein which has a low affinity for penicillin and the level of resistance. the higher activity of some penicillins, as compared to  cephalosporins, has been related to the relatively higher affinity for these penicillins of the penicillin-binding protein involved in the mechanism of resistance. alterations in the autolytic enzyme pattern have been associated with the paradoxical response to bactericidal activity of penicillin often exhibited by enterococcus faecalis clinical isolates.

AB  == ramoplanin is a novel lipoglycopeptide antimicrobial complex, isolated from the fermentation products of a strain of actinoplanes sp. (atcc 33076), which comprises three closely related polypeptides, each containing chlorinated phenyl  moieties and d-mannose. the in-vitro activity of ramoplanin was compared with those of vancomycin and teicoplanin. ramoplanin was very active against staphylococcus spp., irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, with all isolates inhibited by 1 mg/l or less. concentrations of vancomycin and teicoplanin required to inhibit the same population of bacteria were 4 and 16 mg/l, respectively. ramoplanin was also very active against streptococcus spp. (alpha- and beta-haemolytic species, str. pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis, corynebacterium spp. (including cory. jeikeium), listeria monocytogenes, gardnerella vaginalis, propionibacterium acnes and gram-positive anaerobic bacteria, with all isolates inhibited by 2 mg/l, or less. in general, the activity of ramoplanin against these species was either equal to or only slightly less than teicoplanin and equal to or somewhat greater than vancomycin. with the  exception of bacteroides melaninogenicus and bact. bivius, ramoplanin was not active against gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == mechanism of resistance to vancomycin in enterococcus faecium d366 and enterococcus faecalis a256.
AB  == the role of the glycopeptide-inducible proteins of enterococcus faecium d366 (39.5 kilodaltons) and enterococcus faecalis a256 (39 kilodaltons) in the mechanism of resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin was examined. crude cell walls from noninduced cells or from induced cells treated with sodium dodecyl sulfate to remove the inducible proteins were shown to bind vancomycin, in contrast to cell walls containing the cytoplasmic membrane-associated induced proteins, which did not bind vancomycin. cytoplasmic membranes from vancomycin-induced cells did not inactivate (bind) vancomycin or teicoplanin, but they could protect the glycopeptides from being bound to the synthetic pentapeptide. this protection could be competitively abolished by d-alanyl-d-alanine. a decrease in glycopeptide binding to the pentapeptide was observed in a time-dependent fashion after treatment of the pentapeptide with the cytoplasmic membranes from induced cells. we hypothesize that the inducible proteins are responsible for glycopeptide resistance due to the binding to, and subsequent enzymatic modification of, the pentapeptide precursor of peptidoglycan, which is considered to be the natural target of glycopeptides.

TI  == [studies on delayed skin reactivity to streptococci in behcet's disease].
AB  == delayed type hypersensitivity of patients with behcet's disease was investigated  by intradermal skin test and prick test, using various inactivated microorganisms as antigens. in the intradermal skin test, 13 patients showed significantly increased skin reactivity to e. faecalis, compared with 5 normal controls. no significant differences were observed between these two groups in terms of reaction to s. pyogenes. prick test was performed in 11 patients and 6 controls,  using s. pyogenes, s. sanguis, s. salivarius and e. faecalis as antigens. it was  shown that patients with this disease had significantly greater skin reactions to crude cell wall antigens, as well as to whole cell antigens of these streptococci than the controls. the antigenicity of streptococci seemed to be present mainly in the cell wall fragment, and these streptococci seemed to have cross reactivity with each other. these results suggest that streptococci may have some significant role in the immunopathogenesis of this disease.

AB  == enterococcus (streptococcus) faecalis expresses three species-specific surface protein antigens of molecular weights 73,000, 40,000, and 37,000. on western blotting (immunoblotting), they were detected strongly by immunoglobulin g (igg)  in sera from patients with e. faecalis endocarditis, but not in sera from patients with other e. faecalis infections or with endocarditis due to other streptococci. we developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system to measure igg, igm, and iga levels to these antigens and evaluated its potential as a serodiagnostic test for e. faecalis endocarditis. the test correctly diagnosed e. faecalis endocarditis in 15 of 16 cases. of 10 cases of endocarditis due to other streptococci and 10 e. faecalis infections other than endocarditis, 9 and 8, respectively, gave negative results. the test should prove particularly useful in culture-negative cases, for which choice of appropriate antibiotic therapy for e. faecalis endocarditis is vital.

TI  == the life and times of the enterococcus.
AB  == enterococci are important human pathogens that are increasingly resistant to antimicrobial agents. these organisms were previously considered part of the genus streptococcus but have recently been reclassified into their own genus, called enterococcus. to date, 12 species pathogenic for humans have been described, including the most common human isolates, enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. enterococci cause between 5 and 15% of cases of endocarditis, which is best treated by the combination of a cell wall-active agent (such as penicillin or vancomycin, neither of which alone is usually bactericidal) and an aminoglycoside to which the organism is not highly resistant; this characteristically results in a synergistic bactericidal effect. high-level resistance (mic, greater than or equal to 2,000 micrograms/ml) to the aminoglycoside eliminates the expected bactericidal effect, and such resistance has now been described for all aminoglycosides. enterococci can also cause urinary tract infections; intraabdominal, pelvic, and wound infections; superinfections (particularly in patients receiving expanded-spectrum cephalosporins); and bacteremias (often together with other organisms). they are  now the third most common organism seen in nosocomial infections. for most of these infections, single-drug therapy, most often with penicillin, ampicillin, or vancomycin, is adequate. enterococci have a large number of both inherent and acquired resistance traits, including resistance to cephalosporins, clindamycin,  tetracycline, and penicillinase-resistant penicillins such as oxacillin, among others. the most recent resistance traits reported are penicillinase resistance (apparently acquired from staphylococci) and vancomycin resistance, both of which can be transferred to other enterococci. it appears likely that we will soon be faced with increasing numbers of enterococci for which there is no adequate therapy.

TI  == radio-immunoassay for formyl methionyl leucyl phenylalanine. i. development and application to assessment of chemotactic peptide production by enteric bacteria.
AB  == bacterial chemotactic peptides are low molecular weight peptides which stimulate  a wide range of neutrophil functions following binding to specific leucocyte receptors. formyl methionyl leucyl phenylalanine (fmlp) is the major chemotactic  peptide in escherichia coli culture supernatants. this paper reports the development and validation of a radio-immunoassay (ria) for fmlp and its application to the analysis of formyl peptide production by enteric bacteria in vitro. the assay was moderately sensitive (10 nmol/l fmlp) and highly specific showing cross reactivity with f-met-leu-tyr, f-nle-leu-phe and f-met-met-met sequences (id50 = 200, 100 and 250 nmol/l, respectively) but no significant cross reactivity with non-formylated or other formylated di- and tri-peptides (id50 = 10(5) nmol/l. culture supernatants from five species of enteric bacteria were filtered, concentrated and fractionated by reverse phase high performance liquid  chromatography before ria. all five organisms produced immunoreactive f-met peptides. a major peak of immunoreactivity co-chromatographing with authentic fmlp was found in all supernatants, but additional peaks representing more hydrophobic peptides were found in streptococcus faecalis and bacteroides fragilis cultures. in e. coli culture supernatants, concentration of immunoreactive fmlp increased in a linear fashion during 3 h of log phase growth  reaching 31.2 nmol/l(s.e.m. = 10) with final bacterial concentrations of 3 +/- 0.73 x 10(8)/ml (n = 6). these findings extend earlier work showing production of bioactive formyl oligopeptides by different species of enteric bacteria and suggest that a ria for fmlp will be a useful tool for investigating the production and metabolic fate of such peptides in man.

TI  == a model for aggregation-dispersion dynamics of a population.
AB  == an important feature that distinguishes the movement of living systems from the random motion of inorganic material is a delicate balance between spreading and concentrating. this movement is based on the kind of interactions which a bacterial colony may establish during migration. namely, the antagonistic effects of dispersal which take place preferentially down the population gradient and the tendency in grouping together. in this work a model is proposed which considers these effects. the phase plane analysis and the numerical calculations reveal the existence of stable sharp wave front solutions. the speed of the wave front is modulated by the compromise between the tendencies of spreading and aggregating.  the results obtained were compared with experimental observations in cultures of  escherichia coli and streptococcus faecalis. the agreement between both types of  results supports the hypothesis on which the model was based.

TI  == adsorption of streptococcus faecalis on diatomite carriers for use in biotransformations.
AB  == adsorption of cells on particulate carriers is potentially one of the most cost-effective immobilization techniques available. diatomite carriers, such as celite, have desirable physical properties, are inexpensive, and are suitable for both mycelial and bacterial systems. this work investigated the use of diatomite  carriers as a biocatalyst support in a packed-bed reactor where l-tyrosine was enzymatically decarboxylated using adsorbed, non-growing cells of streptococcus faecalis. composition of microbial adsorption on different celite types, with mean pore sizes ranging from 0.55 to 22 microns, showed there was no significant  difference in biomass loading capacity under the conditions used. using celite 560, biomass loadings in a packed-bed reactor varied from 10 to 30 g dm-3 of reactor volume, which compares favourably with other adsorption methods. when used to decarboxylate l-tyrosine, the reactor was found to have a half-life of 15-20 h. a combination of enzyme activity loss and slow leakage of biomass from the packed-bed reactor was responsible for the decline in conversion. treatment of the s. faecalis cells with glutaraldehyde significantly reduced the enzyme activity loss and extended the reactor half-life to 65 h, but had little effect on the rate of cell leakage from the reactor. further work on reduction of cell leakage rate seems necessary for evaluation of the system's practicality.

TI  == [clinical evaluation of cefmenoxime in infections of neonates].
AB  == cefmenoxime (cmx) was evaluated for its absorption and excretion as well as for therapeutic effectiveness in neonates and premature infants. the following results were obtained. 1. serum concentrations of the drug were examined in 3 premature infants 1 to 11 days old upon intravenous administration of about 10 mg/kg body weight (1st group), in 2 premature infants 18 and 32 days old and 1 neonate 17 days old upon intravenous administration of about 20 mg/kg (2nd group), and in 1 neonate 15 days old with meningitis upon intravenous administration of 45.2 mg/kg. concentrations of cmx at 30 minutes after administration were 43, 29 and 27 micrograms/ml, respectively, in the 1st group,  46, 37 and 44 micrograms/ml, respectively, in the 2nd group and 208 micrograms/ml in the other neonate, and appeared to be dose-dependent. concentrations of cmx at 6 hours after administration were 18.2, 6.6 and 8.1 micrograms/ml, respectively,  in the 1st group, 9.6, 11 and 1.35 micrograms/ml, respectively, in the 2nd group  and 5.2 micrograms/ml in the other subject. serum half-lives were, respectively,  4.59, 2.85 and 3.48 hours in the 1st group, 2.52, 2.73 and 1.14 hours in the 2nd  group and 1.0 hour in the other subject. urinary recovery rates during the first  6 hours after administration were 45.8, 87.0, 50.2 and more than 100% in 4 cases  examined. two of these cases, in which recovery rates were 45.8 and 50.2%, were premature infants of low birth weight. spinal fluid concentrations of the drug at 80 to 90 minutes after dosing to 1 neonate with purulent meningitis (causative organism presumed: escherichia coli) given 48.3 mg/kg tended to decline gradually with the recovery of the disease, 3.8, 1.72 and 1.32 micrograms/ml on the 2nd, 6th and 8th day, respectively. 2. the drug was given to 9 neonates 0 to 24 days old. the therapeutic effectiveness on bacterial infections was evaluated in 7 cases (10 diseases) including 1 disease of purulent meningitis presumably caused  by e. coli, 4 of septicemia caused by e. coli, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae (1, 2 and 1, respectively), 3 of urinary tract infection caused by e. coli, serratia and enterococcus faecalis (1 each), 1 of purulent parotitis caused by s. aureus and 1 of pneumonia (causative organism was unknown). therapeutic efficacies were assessed as "excellent" in all of meningitis, septicemia and urinary tract infection cases, and "good" in 1 each of purulent parotitis and pneumonia cases.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == few-minutes tests for the identification of group a streptococci and enterococci  with chromogenic substrates.
AB  == the usefulness of paper strip tests for rapid identification of streptococcus pyogenes and enterococci cultured on blood agar plates was investigated. the paper strips used contain dried chromogenic substrates for pyrrolidonyl peptidase (pyrase) and beta-glucosidase (beta-gluc). material from only a few colonies needed to be applied to the test strips. the reactions could be read after two min (pyrase) and 5-7 min (beta-gluc), respectively. results from testing 503 streptococcal strains were evaluated. the reactions proved very useful for rapid  differentiation of s. pyogenes and enterococci from human sources. nearly all strains of these streptococcal species showed positive reactions in the pyrase test whereas only the enterococci (e. faecalis and e. faecium) were positive for  both enzymes.

AB  == enterococcus (streptococcus) faecalis transposon tn916 was introduced into haemophilus influenzae rd and haemophilus parainfluenzae by transformation and demonstrated to transpose efficiently. haemophilus transformants resistant to tetracycline were observed at a frequency of approximately 3 x 10(2) to 5 x 10(3)/micrograms of either pam120 (pgl101::tn916) or pam180 (pam81::tn916) plasmid dnas, which are incapable of autonomous replication in this host. restriction enzyme analysis and southern blot hybridization revealed that (i) tn916 integrates into many different sites in the h. influenzae and h. parainfluenzae genomes; (ii) only the 16.4-kilobase-pair tn916 dna integrates, and no vector dna was detected; and (iii) the tetr phenotype was stable in the absence of selective pressure. second-generation tn916 transformants occurred at  the high frequency of chromosomal markers and retained their original chromosomal locations. similar results were obtained with h. influenzae rd bc200 rec-1 as the recipient strain, which suggests host rec functions are not required in tn916 integrative transposition. transposition with tn916 is an important procedure for mutagenesis of haemophilus species.

TI  == sodium-translocating adenosine triphosphatase in streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == sodium-translocating atpase in the fermentative bacterium streptococcus faecalis  exchanges sodium for potassium ions. sodium ions stimulate its activity, but k+ ions have no significant effect at present. although the molecular nature of the  sodium atpase is not clear, the enzyme is distinct from other ion-motive atpases  (e1e2 type and f1f0 type) as judged by its resistance to vanadate as well as dicyclohexylcarbodiimde. the sodium atpase is induced when cells are grown on media rich in sodium, particularly under conditions that limit the generation of  a proton potential or block the constitutive sodium proton antiporter, indicating that an increase in the cytoplasmic sodium level serves as the signal. the enzyme is not induced in response to k+ deprivation. the sodium atpase may have evolved  to cope with a sodium-rich environment under conditions that limit the magnitude  of the proton potential.

TI  == influence of technical parameters on the in vitro motility of equine neutrophils  in the presence of streptococcal culture supernatant.
AB  == to identify the influence of technical factors on the in vitro motility of equine neutrophils towards streptococcus culture supernatant in an under-agarose assay,  we studied the changes in eight cell migration parameters. the distances the phagocytes travelled by directed, random and spontaneous migration increased with incubation time, cell concentration and the gelatin and serum contents of the migration plates. the contribution of chemotaxis to the phagocyte migrations, however, decreased simultaneously. the directed and random, though not the spontaneous, migrations of the phagocytes increased also when the chemoattractant wells were placed closer to the cell wells but so did the influence of the chemokinetic activity of the bacterial culture supernatant on phagocyte motility. in contrast, preincubation of migration plates with the chemoattractant, the agarose content of the migration plates and contamination of the granulocytes with non-migrating, mononuclear cells did not substantially affect the in vitro migrations of the neutrophils. the changes in the in vitro motility of the equine neutrophils by these technical factors were, in general, comparable to those reported for human cells attracted by a variety of host-and bacteria-derived chemoattractants.

TI  == the streptococcal flavoprotein nadh oxidase. i. evidence linking nadh oxidase and nadh peroxidase cysteinyl redox centers.
AB  == the fad-containing nadh oxidase from streptococcus faecalis 10c1, which catalyzes the four-electron reduction of o2----2h2o, has been purified by an improved procedure for analyses of its structural and redox properties. the enzyme is apparently a dimer of two identical subunits, each containing 1 mol of fad. dithionite reduction of the enzyme proceeds in two distinct phases corresponding  to approximately 0.5 and 1.1 eq/fad, respectively. thiol assays of the nadh oxidase, reduced anaerobically with 1 eq of nadh/fad prior to denaturation, are consistent with the presence of a single redox-active cysteinyl residue/subunit.  analysis of the cysteinyl peptides of the oxidase, identified in tryptic digests  of the enzyme labeled metabolically with [35s]cysteine, reveals a sequence which  is closely related to the redox-active cysteinyl peptide sequence recently determined for the streptococcal flavoprotein nadh peroxidase. a second cysteinyl peptide sequence, when aligned with residues 3-17 of the peroxidase nh2-terminal  sequence, reveals identity in 7 of 15 positions and satisfies several of the criteria described for adp-binding structures. additional probes of the structural and redox properties of the nadh oxidase, including visible circular dichroism spectroscopy and sensitivity to inactivation by hydrogen peroxide, provide further evidence for a fundamental structural connection between flavin-dependent nadh oxidase and peroxidase functions.

TI  == immune response in patients with intraabdominal infections treated with imipenem. swedish study group.
AB  == in the present investigation the humoral immune response against isolated microorganisms in patients treated with imipenem was studied. sixty-six patients  (34 men and 32 women, 18-86 years of age) with suspicion of intraabdominal infections entered the study. five patients were excluded for various reasons and the remaining 61 patients were treated with imipenem/cilastatin 0.5-1.0 g t.i.d.  for 5-29 days (median nine days). three serum samples were taken from each patient, the first sample at admission, the second between three and seven days after the first dose of imipenem/cilastatin and the third between 14 and 31 days  after the first dose. one third of the patients had a malignant disease and the verified intraabdominal infections were judged to be severe in 23 and moderately  severe in 33 of the patients. fifty-six patients (92%) were cured and five patients (8%) were considered improved after the treatment. the immune response against isolated microorganisms was measured in the three serum samples by indirect immunofluorescence tests and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. among the aerobic microorganisms isolated escherichia coli (46 strains) staphylococcus  epidermidis (22 strains), streptococcus milleri (15 strains) and enterococcus faecalis (11 strains) dominated and among the anaerobic bacteria bacteroides fragilis (39 strains). thirty-two patients had significant immune responses against one or more of the isolated microorganisms. e. coli and b. fragilis gave  rises in antibody titers in 13 and 20 cases respectively, while significant titers against s. epidermidis were noticed in only three cases, against s. milleri in two cases and against e. faecalis in three cases.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == pip501 is a 30.2-kilobase (kb) broad-host-range conjugative streptococcal plasmid which encodes chloramphenicol and erythromycin resistance. a smaller conjugation-proficient derivative of pip501 has been constructed and designated pva1702. pva1702 is 25.2 kb, encodes only kanamycin resistance, and confers conjugative ability in an enterococcus faecalis mating system. the temperature-sensitive transposon delivery vectors ptv1ts and ptv32 carrying tn917 and tn917lac, respectively, were used to create insertion mutants of pva1702 in e. faecalis. these insertions enabled us to localize the determinants conferring  conjugation to two separate regions of pva1702: the 7.5-kb region a and the 8.8-kb region b. a nested set of deletions of the 7.5-kb region was subcloned in  escherichia coli, and the expression of these deletions was examined in an e. coli minicell system. the genes for three conjugal proteins have been located and designated cnja, cnjb, and cnjc (for conjugation). two other peptides that are transcribed in a divergent direction from the cnj genes were encoded in the a region, but it is not known whether they are involved in conjugation. these studies indicate that the conjugation genes of pip501 are arranged in multiple transcriptional units.

AB  == streptococcus faecalis was used as a bacterial model for studying the mode of action of monensin by nmr investigations. experiments were carried out in two states, characterized by several complementary methods: (i) the resting (de-energized) cell which was considered as an inert biological membrane, on which cationic transport induced by the ionophore alone can be investigated; (ii) the active (energized) cell where the ionophore-sensitive response of the living  organism, particularly the cation pumps and the glycolysis, is probed. studies of resting cells were performed, with changing external ionic concentrations, in the presence of monensin, which is preferentially a sodium carrier. internal and external na+ and h+ were followed by corresponding 23na and 31p (inorganic phosphate) nmr resonances, k+ fluxes were measured by atomic absorption. it was shown that the induced cationic movements were linked to the existing ionic gradients for k+ and na+. 31p and 13c nmr spectra for the intermediary metabolites detected in active cells showed that glycolysis is dramatically modified in the presence of monensin.

TI  == transfer of tn1545 and tn916 to clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  == tn1545, a conjugative transposon originally discovered in streptococcus pneumoniae, has been transferred from enterococcus faecalis and bacillus subtilis to clostridium acetobutylicum ncib 8052. transfer between different strains of c. acetobutylicum has also been observed. insertion of tn1545 into the c. acetobutylicum chromosome occurred at multiple sites, as shown by southern hybridization. although ermam (erythromycin-resistance) was the most satisfactory marker for primary selection of transconjugants, all three tn1545-encoded antibiotic resistance genes (apha-3, ermam, and tetm) were apparently expressed in c. acetobutylicum. our results indicate that tn1545 is potentially useful for  undertaking mutagenesis and mutational cloning in this industrially important organism. transfer of another conjugative transposon, tn916, from e. faecalis to  c. acetobutylicum ncib 8052 was also apparently detected. circumstantial evidence suggests that there may be a hot spot for tn916 insertion in the c. acetobutylicum ncib 8052 chromosome.

TI  == daptomycin (ly146032) for prevention and treatment of experimental aortic valve endocarditis in rabbits.
AB  == the efficacy of daptomycin (ly146032), a vancomycinlike lipopeptide antibiotic, was compared with that of antibiotics commonly in use for prevention and treatment of experimental aortic valve endocarditis in rabbits. strains of staphylococcus aureus. s. epidermidis, streptococcus sanguis, and enterococcus faecalis were used to establish endocarditis. a single 10-mg/kg dose of daptomycin and a single 25-mg/kg dose of vancomycin were both effective in prevention of endocarditis produced by strains of s. aureus and s. sanguis. daptomycin was more effective than vancomycin for prevention of endocarditis caused by the strain of s. epidermidis. a single dose of daptomycin also was more effective in prevention of staphylococcal and enterococcal endocarditis than were single-dose regimens of cefazolin (100 mg/kg) and the combination of ampicillin (30 mg/kg) plus gentamicin (3 mg/kg), respectively. for treatment of endocarditis, daptomycin (10 mg/kg) as a single daily dose was as effective as regimens of either vancomycin or beta-lactam antibiotics for staphylococcal and enterococcal endocarditis. daptomycin, however, was not as effective as a single  daily dose of 600,000 u of procaine penicillin for endocarditis caused by the strain of s. sanguis.

TI  == teicoplanin in the treatment of gram-positive-bacterial endocarditis.
AB  == intravenous teicoplanin has been used to treat 23 cases of gram-positive-bacterial endocarditis, usually with 3 to 7 mg/kg every 12 h on the first day, followed by 3 to 7 mg/kg every 24 h. for some cases (staphylococcal and enterococcal endocarditis), the dosage was 8 to 14.4 mg/kg per day and/or other antibiotics were given. the mean duration was 48.2 days (range, 23 to 130 days). of 23 patients, 21 (91.3%) had negative cultures or were cured. a total of 18 patients were treated with teicoplanin alone; of these, 4 had surgery, and all (except 2 who relapsed) were cured. teicoplanin was combined with one or more antibiotics in five cases; in all cases appropriate cultures were negative, but three patients died during therapy or follow-up. mild renal impairment was seen in two patients; both were receiving teicoplanin in combination with an aminoglycoside. we conclude that intravenous teicoplanin administered once a day  at doses of 7 to 14 mg/kg per day is well tolerated, easy to administer, and may  represent an efficacious therapy for gram-positive-bacterial endocarditis.

TI  == high-level vancomycin-resistant enterococci causing hospital infections.
AB  == nosocomial infection or colonization due to enterococci with high-level resistance to vancomycin (minimal inhibitory concentrations [mics] between 64 and greater than 2000 mg/l) has occurred in 41 patients with renal disease. these vancomycin-resistant enterococci were cultured from many sources including blood. all but one strain contained one or more plasmids ranging in molecular weight from 1.0 to 40 megadaltons (mda). vancomycin resistance was transferable by conjugation to a susceptible recipient strain of enterococcus faecalis but this was not always associated with plasmid dna. the emergence of transferable high-level vancomycin resistance in enterococci causing significant clinical infections is of particular importance since vancomycin is widely regarded as a reserve drug for the management of infections with multi-resistant gram-positive  organisms.

TI  == enhancement of survival from murine polymicrobial peritonitis with increased abdominal abscess formation.
AB  == muramyl dipeptide (mdp), a purified synthetic immune adjuvant, has been shown to  increase murine intraabdominal abscess formation in a monomicrobial model using bacteroides fragilis. this effect required live bacteria and was abolished by appropriate antibiotics. a polymicrobial model of peritonitis and abdominal abscess formation using streptococcus fecalis, escherichia coli, and b. fragilis  was initially used to determine mortality rates at various concentrations and obtain an appropriate ld50. animals were then pretreated with mdp or its inert buffer and underwent intraperitoneal injection of the appropriate bacterial suspension. mortality and abdominal abscess formation were then assessed at 2 weeks after injection. there was a significant reduction in mortality (p less than 0.03) in mice treated with mdp compared to the controls. in surviving animals, there was also a significant increase in the number of animals forming abscesses (p less than 0.05) following treatment with mdp. this study has shown that nonspecific immune stimulation by mdp provided enhanced protection against a polymicrobial intraperitoneal challenge and paradoxically increased the formation of abdominal abscesses at the same time. this may be regarded as enhancement of the natural history of survival from peritonitis via bacterial containment through intraabdominal abscess formation, a manifestation of beneficial outcome in experimental peritonitis.

TI  == [transfer of bacterial drug resistance factor in artificial dental plaque].
AB  == transfer of drug resistance factor was examined using so-called artificial dental plaque. clinically isolated specimens of enterococcus faecalis showing various kind of drug resistance were used as the donors. streptococcus mutans bht strain  was used as the recipient and the plaque former. s. mutans formed artificial dental plaque on the surface of glass sticks after 7 to 10 day cultivation in brain heart infusion medium containing 5% sucrose. each strain of e. faecalis was added to the plaque culture and co-cultured further 24 hours. colonies were formed on drug-containing plates by 5 different mixed cultures with the frequencies of 10(-5)-10(-6) (kanamycin, km) and 10(-4)-10(-8) (erythromycin, em). since these values were higher than that of the mutation frequency, we conclude that the resistant sublines were formed by a genetic transfer. plasmid dna derived from some transferred sublines was electrophoreted and the patterns were compared with those from the donor and the recipient. one km-resistant subline showed a new band at the point of 40 kb which was not found in the plasmid dna from the donor. it is suggested that the plasmid containing km-resistance gene was modified molucularly. sublines without new plasmid band were obtained also. there may be technical problems with it, or the transferred gene may be incorporated in a chromosome. considering above results, the effect of bacterial transferable genes on oral hygiene were discussed.

TI  == purification and characterization of human neutrophil peptide 4, a novel member of the defensin family.
AB  == primary (azurophil) granules of neutrophils contain proteins which play a major role in the killing and digestion of bacteria in the phagolysosome. we have isolated and characterized a novel antimicrobial peptide from the azurophil granule fraction of discontinuous percoll gradients. we have named this peptide human neutrophil peptide 4 (hnp-4) based on its structural similarity to a group  of antimicrobial polypeptides known as defensins (hnp 1-3). using size exclusion  and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography, hnp-4 was purified to homogeneity as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and amino-terminal sequence analysis. the amino acid sequence determined from isolated hnp-4 and from tryptic fragments of reduced and alkylated peptide is: nh2-val-cys-ser-cys-arg-leu-val-phe-cys-arg-arg-thr-glu- leu-arg-val-gly-asn-cys-leu-ile-gly-gly-val-ser-phe-thr-tyr-cys-cys-thr- arg-val  - cooh. based on this sequence, hnp-4 has a calculated molecular weight of 3715 and a theoretical pi of 8.61. hnp-4 shows structural similarity to the family of  three human defensins. hnp-4 and the defensins have identical cysteine backbones  and, like the defensins, hnp-4 is rich in arginine (15.2 mol %). however, the amino acids at 22 of the 33 positions differ between hnp-4 and human defensins. further, hnp-4 is significantly more hydrophobic than the defensins, as determined by its retention time on reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. in vitro, purified hnp-4 was shown to kill escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, and candida albicans. compared to a mixture of the other  human defensins, hnp-4 was found to be approximately 100 times more potent against e. coli and four times more potent against both s. faecalis and c. albicans.

AB  == the influence of cefpodoxime proxetil (cpdx-pr, cs-807), a new oral cephalosporin, on the intestinal bacterial flora was studied in tetra-contaminated mice and in pediatric patients. cpdx-pr dry syrup was administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg once a day for 5 consecutive days to mice contaminated with 4 different species of bacteria: escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis and bifidobacterium breve. no notable changes were observed in fecal viable cell counts except that slight decreases of e. coli counts were observed on the days 3 to 5 after starting administration. the subjects in the pediatric study were 5 children with infections, 3 boys and 2 girls at ages from 1 year 1 month to 6 years 10 months, with their body weights ranging from 9.3 to 23.8 kg. cpdx-pr dry syrup was administered at a dose between 3.0 to 3.7 mg/kg, 3 times a day for 4 to 7 days. although some variations of the  fecal bacterial flora were noticed between subjects during the administration of  cpdx-pr, no notable changes were observed in major aerobic and anaerobic bacteria such as enterobacteriaceae, enterococcus, bacteroides and bifidobacterium in 4 of the 5 cases. large decreases in streptococcus, enterobacteriaceae, bifidobacterium, eubacterium and anaerobic cocci and an increase in enterococcus  were observed in the other case. there was no case in which glucose non-fermenting gram-negative rods and fungi became predominant. regarding enterobacteriaceae, transitory bacterial replacement was observed within the genus. fecal concentration of cpdx during the administration of cpdx-pr was extremely low or below the detectable limit except one specimen from a case in which intestinal bacterial flora showed remarkable changes. from the above, cpdx-pr appears to be a drug with a relatively small influence on the intestinal  bacterial flora.

TI  == the 1h nmr visibility of intracellular lactate in streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == 1h nmr studies of glycolysis in washed cell suspensions of streptococcus faecalis indicated that intracellular lactate is not 1h nmr visible. evidence for this was gained from time course studies of glycolysis at increasing concentrations of glucose. a close correlation existed between the relative increase in the lactate integral and the enzymatically determined extracellular lactate concentration [lo]. when ionophores which cause the collapse of the positive intracellular/extracellular lactate gradient were added to cell suspensions following fermentation of 5, 10 and 50 mm glucose, the increase in the lactate integral was proportional to the respective increase in [lo]. a more direct method for determining the origin of the lactate signal involved centrifugation of a cell suspension after fermentation of 50 mm glucose and measurement of lactate in the extracellular and intracellular fluid. 1h spectra of the cell suspension, supernatant and sonicated pellet revealed that the lactate observed in the cell suspension was equivalent to the lactate in the supernatant alone. the intracellular lactate contained in the pellet represented 42% of the total lactate, indicating that only 58% of lactate is detected by in vivo 1h mrs of s.  faecalis. this result is in contrast with the high percentage (70-90%) of in vitro lactate which is detected by in vivo 1h mrs of mammalian brain tissue (williams s. r. et al. magn. res. med. 7, 425-431, 1988). this may be due to a higher proportion of extracellular lactate in mammalian tissue or differences in  the intracellular environments of bacterial and mammalian cells.

AB  == lomefloxacin is a new difluoro-quinolone. in this study, we have determined the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared it with that of other fluoro-quinolones and some unrelated  antimicrobials. lomefloxacin was very active against enterobacteriaceae (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) with activity comparable to that of ofloxacin (mic90, 0.25 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was moderately active against isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), and again the activity was comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml) but was eightfold less than ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was also active against isolates of staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 1 micrograms/ml), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, and this activity was most comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was fourfold less active than either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin against isolates of enterococcus faecalis (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml) and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). in common with ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin was very active against isolates of neisseria spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), haemophilus spp. (mic90, less  than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), legionella spp. (mic90, less than or equal  to 0.06 micrograms/ml), vibrio spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), and campylobacter jejuni (mic90, 1 microgram/ml). lomefloxacin showed poor activity against isolates of bacteroides spp. (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml) or clostridium difficile mic90, 32 micrograms/ml) and was only moderately active against isolates of clostridium perfringens (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), peptostreptococcus spp. (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), chlamydia trachomatis (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), mycoplasma hominis (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), and urea-plasma urealyticum (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was found to be bactericidal at concentrations generally close to the mic with greater than 3 log10 reduction in viability of exponentially dividing cultures of escherichia coli and s. aureus within 5 hr of exposure to concentrations at eight times the mic. these results indicate a potential clinical role for lomefloxacin in the treatment of genitourinary tract infections caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respiratory tract infections  caused by susceptible organisms, and soft tissue infections caused by s. aureus.

AB  == pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on imipenem/cilastatin sodium (ipm/cs) were performed in neonates. the results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. plasma levels and urinary excretion of ipm and cs sodium were determined in 7 neonates with ages between 7 and 26 days (gestation periods were  37 to 41 weeks and birth weights were 2,410 to 3,890 g) upon 1 hour drip intravenous infusion of ipm/cs at 10 mg/10 mg/kg, or 20 mg/20 mg/kg. mean plasma  concentrations of ipm reached their peaks at the end of infusion with levels of 12.7 +/- 3.0 micrograms/ml for the group given 10 mg/10 mg/kg, and 19.1 +/- 4.1 micrograms/ml for 20 mg/20 mg/kg. the concentration of ipm in plasma showed a dose-response to the 10 mg/10 mg/kg and 20 mg/20 mg/kg dosages. concentrations decreased with half-lives of 1.87 +/- 0.71 hours and 1.97 +/- 0.21 hours for the  low and the high dosages, and plasma levels at 8 hours after administration were  0.3 +/- 0.1 microgram/ml and 0.8 +/- 0.3 microgram/ml, respectively. mean urinary recovery rates in 8 hours after administration were 37.6 +/- 11.8% and 26.8 +/- 17.2% for the low and the high dosages. while, mean plasma concentrations and mean urinary recovery rates of cs were higher than those of ipm, mean plasma half-lives of cs were similar to ipm. 2. ipm/cs was administered to 11 neonatal patients (with ages between 1 and 26 days) of various bacterial infections, and clinical effectiveness, bacteriological efficacy and adverse reactions were evaluated. clinical efficacies in cases including 7 with acute pneumonia and 1 each with suspected septicemia, intrauterine infection, acute urinary tract infection and periproctal abscess were judged excellent in 10 and good in 1 case, and the efficacy rate was 100%. causative organisms isolated from these patients  included 3 strains of escherichia coli and 1 strain each of streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae enterococcus faecalis and haemophilus influenzae. all the organisms were eradicated by ipm/cs, thus the bacteriological eradication rate was 100%. no adverse reactions were observed, but decreased platelet in 1 patient and increased got in 2 patients were found as abnormal laboratory test values. these changes, however were transient, and returned to normal after discontinuation of ipm/cs. it was concluded that the clinical results of ipm/cs are indicative of excellent efficacy, safety and usefulness of  the drug in the treatment of infections in neonates.

AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == saliva-mediated aggregation of enterococcus faecalis transformed with a streptococcus sanguis gene encoding the ssp-5 surface antigen.
AB  == the interaction of a high-molecular-weight salivary glycoprotein (agglutinin) with streptococcus sanguis m5 leads to the formation of bacterial aggregates. we  have previously shown that the ssp-5 surface antigen from s. sanguis m5 binds the salivary agglutinin and therefore may be involved in the aggregation process. here we report the transformation of a nonaggregating enterococcus faecalis strain with the ssp-5 gene and show that the protein is expressed on the cell surface and confers an aggregation-positive phenotype. e. faecalis s161 protoplasts were transformed with pam401 eb-5, a shuttle vector containing the s. sanguis ssp-5 gene, resulting in the isolation of e. faecalis s161eb-5. crude cell extracts from this transformant and from s. sanguis m5 were analyzed by western blotting. extracts from s. sanguis m5 possessed peptides of 190 and 205 kilodaltons that reacted strongly with polyclonal antibodies against the recombinant ssp-5 antigen. e. faecalis s161eb-5 contained only the 190-kilodalton immunoreactive protein, suggesting that the antigen may be processed differently  in e. faecalis s161eb-5. the parent strain, e. faecalis s161, did not react with  this antibody preparation. immunogold labeling of intact e. faecalis s161eb-5 and s. sanguis m5 with anti-ssp-5 immunoglobulin g showed that both organisms expressed similar levels of the antigen. both organisms formed visible aggregates upon incubation with salivary agglutinin. these results suggest that the ssp-5 antigen may mediate both the binding of agglutinin to s. sanguis m5 and the subsequent formation of bacterial aggregates.

TI  == genetic basis of antibiotic resistance in aerococcus viridans.
AB  == resistance to at least one of the following antibiotics was found in eight wild-type strains of aerococcus viridans: erythromycin (six strains), tetracycline and minocycline (five strains), chloramphenicol (one strain), and high levels of streptomycin (one strain). none of the strains transferred any of  their antibiotic resistance markers into streptococcal, enterococcal, or a. viridans recipients by conjugation. by dna-dna hybridization experiments, the ermb gene of transposon tn917, of enterococcus faecalis origin, was detected in five of the six strains resistant to erythromycin and was localized for one strain on the chromosome and for four strains on nonconjugative small (4.7- to 4.9-kilobase) plasmids. the tetm gene of the conjugative transposon tn916, of e.  faecalis origin, was localized on the chromosome of four of the five strains resistant to tetracycline and minocycline; in three of these strains a structure  similar to that of tn916 was found. homology to the teto gene of pua466, of campylobacter jejuni origin, was detected on the chromosome of the fifth strain.  no sequence homology was detected in any strain with probes corresponding to the  tetl gene of group b streptococcus origin, to the erma gene of the transposon tn554 of staphylococcus aureus origin, or to the cat genes of either pc194 or pc221 of s. aureus origin.

TI  == the enterococci: evidence of species-specific clinical and microbiologic heterogeneity.
AB  == investigations of the clinical role of enterococci have been limited largely to enterococcal bacteremia and endocarditis and have not distinguished between the various species of enterococci. to characterize the full spectrum of enterococcal disease and to determine whether clinically important differences exist among infections and/or instances of colonization (infections/colonizations) by the various enterococcal species, cases of enterococcal infection/colonization diagnosed at the dallas veterans administration medical center (dvamc) in 1986 were reviewed. during this period, 220 enterococcus faecalis, 21 enterococcus faecium, 12 enterococcus avium, and no enterococcus durans isolates were identified in clinical specimens (other than stool) submitted to the dvamc microbiology laboratory. clinical characteristics of cases of infection/colonization by the three species of enterococci were similar and did not vary significantly when blood stream invasion occurred. nevertheless, mortality data and therapeutic response rates suggested differences in virulence  of the three enterococcal species. enterococcal infections/colonizations (including bacteremia) frequently were polymicrobial. although enterobacteriaceae were the most common copathogens identified overall, staphylococcus aureus was the most common copathogen in bloodstream infections. e. avium was more resistant than e. faecalis or e. faecium to penicillin g and ampicillin and less resistant  to most other antimicrobial agents. the results of this investigation suggest that enterococci are a heterogeneous group of bacteria that should not be treated as a single entity in clinical investigations.

AB  == the in vitro bactericidal activity of daptomycin and vancomycin alone or in combination was studied against enterococci in a microtiter checkerboard assay and by kill-kinetic experiments. daptomycin was more active than vancomycin and was bactericidal. better fractional bactericidal concentration indices were observed with combinations of vancomycin with aminoglycosides, but in kill-kinetic studies, the combinations of 4 mics of daptomycin with 4 mg/l of tobramycin or netilmicin produced the more lethal effect; these combinations were even more lethal than ampicillin and aminoglycosides in the same conditions. while vancomycin and ampicillin were antagonistic, synergistic fbc indices were observed with daptomycin and ampicillin in combination, but at 4 mics of each antibiotic, the combination was less bactericidal than ampicillin alone. the bactericidal effect obtained with daptomycin in combination with aminoglycosides  suggest that further evaluation of these combinations in enterococcal endocarditis could have a clinical interest if this bactericidal effect was confirmed by in vivo studies.

TI  == in vitro synergism between daptomycin and fosfomycin against enterococcus faecalis isolates with high-level gentamicin resistance.
AB  == daptomycin and fosfomycin are two agents which inhibit different steps in peptidoglycan synthesis. we studied the in vitro activities of these drugs, alone and in combination, by time-kill techniques against 21 clinical isolates of enterococcus (streptococcus) faecalis demonstrating high-level resistance to gentamicin. combinations of fosfomycin and daptomycin exhibited synergistic bactericidal activity (100-fold decrease in cfu per milliliter at 24 h compared with daptomycin alone) against all strains (mean +/- standard deviation of increment in killing = 2.7 +/- 0.7 log10 cfu/ml). in a subgroup of strains against which daptomycin (5 micrograms/ml) alone was bactericidal (greater than 3 log10 killing), synergistic activity was demonstrable only when the concentration of daptomycin was lowered to 0.25 to 0.5 microgram/ml. a 50% dilution of human serum diminished the bactericidal activity of daptomycin alone at 24 h but did not affect killing observed with the daptomycin-fosfomycin combination. the inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis by the combination was greater than the inhibition observed with either drug alone. the combination of daptomycin and fosfomycin exhibited consistent synergistic bactericidal activity against strains of e. faecalis possessing high-level resistance to gentamicin. this synergism may be the result of sequential inhibition of early steps in peptidoglycan synthesis.

TI  == effects of spermine and spermidine on the inorganic pyrophosphatase of streptococcus faecalis. interactions between polyamines and inorganic pyrophosphate.
AB  == we have shown a dual role for mg2+ in the hydrolysis of ppi catalysed by inorganic pyrophosphatase (ppase; ec 3.6.1.1) of streptococcus faecalis; mg2+ is  necessary for the formation of the substrates, mg1ppi2- and mg2ppi0, and it also  acts as an allosteric activator [lahti + jokinen (1985) biochemistry 24, 3526-3530]. no activity can be observed with s. faecalis ppase in the absence of  bivalent cations, which indicates that free ppi cannot serve as a substrate for this enzyme. however, significant activities were observed in the presence of spermine and spermidine, even though no bivalent cations were present. it was shown by particle-induced gamma-ray emission and particle-induced x-ray-emission  analysis that the polyamines used were not contaminated with mg2+ or any other bivalent cations that could support ppase activity. hence it is obvious that polyamines are able to form a complex with ppi that serves as a substrate for ppase. the apparent stability constants for the 1:1 adducts of spermine and spermidine were estimated by a resin competition method. the values obtained at ph 7.5 were 2.7 x 10(3) m-1 and 6.4 x 10(2) m-1 respectively. kinetic results further suggested that polyamines can also substitute for mg2+ as an activator in vitro. the physiological significance of these polyamine effects were discussed.

TI  == characterization of the human neutrophil response to sex pheromones from streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == synthetic analogs of sex pheromones from streptococcus faecalis and related pheromone inhibitors have been assayed for their possible effects on human neutrophil leukocyte activation. these sex pheromones are hydrophobic peptides that have regulatory roles in bacterial mating behavior leading to intercellular  plasmid transfer. five of the seven peptides tested were chemotactic for neutrophils in the 10(-5) to 10(-6) m concentration range. exposure of neutrophils to these same peptides induced polarization of the cells and triggered superoxide production. cross-desensitization experiments suggest that s. faecalis bacterial peptides act via the fmlf-receptor on neutrophils. this conclusion is supported by the results that leukocyte polarization responses induced by synthetic analogs of s. faecalis sex pheromones can be blocked by t-boc-flflf, a known antagonist of fmlf. it is concluded that inflammatory properties of bacterial supernatants, particularly in the case of s. faecalis strains and perhaps in other bacterial genuses, are contributed in part by nonformylated hydrophobic oligopeptides that recognize and act through the fmlf receptor to activate neutrophils.

TI  == regulation of the cytoplasmic ph by a proton-translocating atpase in streptococcus faecalis (faecium). a computer simulation.
AB  == earlier work from this laboratory led to the proposal that the cytoplasmic ph of  streptococcal cells is regulated solely by changes in the amount and activity of  a proton-translocating atpase, f1f0 complex [kobayashi, h., suzuki, t. & unemoto, t. (1986) j. biol. chem. 261, 627-630]. we have now examined the proposal with the aid of computer simulation. we find that an increase in the amount of the h+-atpase is necessary for ph regulation and is sufficient to maintain a constant steady-state cytoplasmic ph. an increase in h+-atpase activity is insufficient by itself to maintain a constant cytoplasmic ph, but suppresses the initial fluctuation of the ph. when both variations were allowed, the simulated cytoplasmic ph remained constant despite large perturbations, suggesting that this regulatory system has ample capacity to compensate for ph changes. the present work shows that a computer simulation is a useful way to examine a model  for biological regulatory system; application of the simulation to other regulatory systems is discussed.

TI  == intra-abdominal sepsis after hepatic resection.
AB  == one hundred and thirty hepatic resections performed over an 8-year period were reviewed for evidence of postoperative intra-abdominal sepsis. of 126 patients who survived for more than 24 hours after operation, 36 developed culture positive intra-abdominal collections (28.6%). significant independent variables associated with the development of intra-abdominal sepsis were diagnoses of trauma or cholangiocarcinoma, and the need for reoperation to control hemorrhage  during the postoperative period. before 1984, infected fluid collections were treated predominantly by operative drainage, but this has largely been replaced by percutaneous methods, which have proven effective in most cases. eighteen (50%) of the infections were caused by a mixed bacterial culture, with streptococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli being the most common isolates. six patients with clinical signs of sepsis had a sterile fluid collection drained with complete relief of symptoms. this review suggests that intra-abdominal sepsis is a frequent complication after hepatic resection, and can often be managed successfully by nonoperative percutaneous drainage.

AB  == an extracellular zn-endopeptidase was purified to homogeneity from the culture filtrates of streptococcus faecalis (human oral strain 0g1-10) by a procedure that comprised concentration in an amicon hollow fiber system, ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel permeation chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography (batch operation on phenyl-sepharose cl-4b), followed by fast protein liquid chromatography (fplc) on a phenyl-superose hr 5/5 column, and finally fplc on a superose 12 hr 10/30 column. the enzyme is a 31.5-kda strongly  hydrophobic protein with an isoelectric point of 4.6 and a broad ph optimum of 6  to 8. the substrate specificity of the enzyme is similar to that of the mammalian membrane endopeptidase-24.11 and streptococcus thermophilus thermolysin (ec 3.4.24.4) in hydrolyzing preferentially the phe24-phe25 bond in insulin b-chain,  followed by cleavage of the his5-leu6 bond. the enzyme was especially active on azocoll and gelatin; soluble and insoluble collagens were hydrolyzed at a lower rate. s. faecalis sex pheromone-related peptides and several mammalian bioactive  peptides were cleaved at sites involving pronounced hydrophobicity. the enzyme did not hydrolyze small synthetic peptide derivatives (phenylazobenzyloxycarbonyl-l-pro-l-leu-gly-l-pro-d-arg and 2-furylacryloyl-l-leu-gly-l-ala) that are typically attacked by "true" bacterial  collagenases. chemical modification indicated the importance of histidyl, carboxyl, and tyrosyl groups in enzyme activity, suggesting that this enzyme may  thus be classified as a metalloprotease ii (ec 3.4.24.4). the enzyme is strongly  inhibited by a 720-kda factor present in rat inflammatory exudate. the pronounced ability of the enzyme to attack collagenous materials and certain bioactive peptides suggests its participation in inflammatory processes involving the presence of s. faecalis.

TI  == dna probe for identification of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == a total of 287 clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) were  tested for their ability to undergo autolysis when treated with sodium deoxycholate. the test was positive for all but one isolate, strain doc-1. this autolysis required the activity of an enzyme which is unique and characteristic of s. pneumoniae: a choline-dependent n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase, the gene product of the lyta gene. we used lyta as a dna probe to test the distribution of the autolysin gene among clinical isolates of s. pneumoniae. in dot blot hybridization experiments our probe reacted with the dna of 60 of 60 strains tested, including the autolysis-deficient clinical isolate doc-1. no hybridization occurred when strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus (enterococcus) faecalis, streptococcus (enterococcus) faecium, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus bovis were tested. the lyta gene appears to be an ideal candidate for use as a dna probe for the identification of s. pneumoniae.

TI  == hemagglutination activities of group b, c, d, and g streptococci: demonstration of novel sugar-specific cell-binding activities in streptococcus suis.
AB  == a total of 378 streptococcal isolates of lancefield groups b, c, d and g were tested for their ability to hemagglutinate untreated, sialidase-treated, and endo-beta-galactosidase-treated human erythrocytes. of the 43 strains showing positive hemagglutination, 9 were inhibitable with neutral monosaccharides. four  strains were inhibited with galactose and n-acetylgalactosamine, whereas five were inhibited with galactose only. a third, sialic acid-specific adhesion activity was suggested for two additional strains on the basis of their agglutination of native and endo-beta-galactosidase-treated but not sialidase-treated erythrocytes. all the sugar-specific agglutination activities detected were confined to streptococcus suis strains of group d streptococci, whereas streptococci of other groups did not exhibit these types of hemagglutination activities. the adhesins were sensitive to proteases and heat treatment, which indicates that they were proteins. the hemagglutinating isolates of s. suis originated from pig brain and lung, human brain, and the tonsils of healthy pigs. no clear correlation with a particular serotype was observed. these results demonstrate the occurrence of unique sugar-specific adherence activities  in s. suis, an important pig pathogen with occasional human pathogenicity.

TI  == new approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of infective endocarditis: review of 100 consecutive cases.
AB  == to assess the effect of our new, more aggressive approach to treating infective endocarditis, we retrospectively reviewed our recent experience with this disease. between 1983 and 1989, we treated 100 patients with endocarditis, in 94  of whom the diagnosis was confirmed. fifty-four (57%) of the 94 patients had native valve endocarditis, and the other 40 patients (43%) had prosthetic valve endocarditis. the patients' mean ages were 50 years for native valve disease and  58 years for prosthetic valve disease (p < 0.05). the male-to-female ratio was 4:1. among the patients with confirmed endocarditis, 87 (93%) had significant underlying risk factors for endocarditis. upon physical examination of the 94 patients, 16 (17%) were afebrile, 15 (16%) had negative blood cultures, and 26 (28%) had no cardiovascular symptoms or immunologic findings. echocardiography was of limited value: its sensitivity was 56% for native valve endocarditis and 33% for prosthetic valve endocarditis. the ratio of affected valves was 5 aortic:4 mitral: 1 tricuspid in both forms of the disease. viridans streptococcus was isolated in 23 (25%) of the confirmed cases, enterococcus faecalis in 17 (18%), staphylococcus aureus in 13 (14%), and coagulase-negative staphylococcus in 14 (15%). gram-negative, anaerobic, and fungal organisms accounted for only 13 (14%) of the confirmed cases. the mean duration of intravenous therapy was 29 days. twenty (37%) of the native valve patients and 16 (40%) of the prosthetic valve patients received antibiotics on an outpatient basis. vancomycin was used in 44 (47%) of the cases, nafcillin or ampicillin in 40 (44%), and other beta-lactam agents in 9 (10%). the mean hospital stay was significantly longer for prosthetic valve endocarditis patients than for those with native valve disease (29 versus 23 days; p < 0.01). cardiac catheterization was performed in 9 native valve patients (17%) and 6 prosthetic valve patients (15%). valve surgery  was performed in 33 native valve patients (61%) and 22 prosthetic valve patients  (55%). failure, defined as in-hospital death or recurrent endocarditis, accounted for 14 (28%) of the native valve cases (17% death and 11% relapse) and 8 (20%) of the prosthetic valve cases (10% death and 10% relapse), for an overall failure rate of 24%. the rate of failure was independent of the infecting pathogen or the type of antimicrobial therapy applied. our experience verified that, in many patients with significant underlying risk factors, the diagnosis of endocarditis  may be made on an empiric basis.

AB  == the first case report of leukopenia with neutropenia due to the new glycopeptide  antibiotic teicoplanin is described. the side effect occurred in a 73-year-old man hospitalized because of subacute bacterial endocarditis caused by streptococcus faecalis. leukopenia with neutropenia (white blood cells 2000/mm3,  neutrophils 46%) developed after 20 days of teicoplanin therapy. after stopping teicoplanin white blood cell and neutrophil counts reverted to normal, but dropped again on rechallenge. a review of 1500 records of patients treated with teicoplanin alone or in combination with other drugs was also performed. five cases were found in which leukopenia was possibly (four cases) or probably (one case) related to teicoplanin therapy. from these preliminary data the incidence of leukopenia related to teicoplanin seems to be low.

AB  == enterococcus faecium bm4165 and bm4178, isolated from immunocompromised patients, one treated with vancomycin, were inducibly resistant to high levels of the glycopeptide antibiotics vancomycin and teicoplanin but susceptible to the new lipopeptide daptomycin (ly146032). strain bm4165 was also resistant to macrolidelincosamide-streptogramin b-type (mls) antibiotics. the genes conferring resistance to glycopeptides and to mls antibiotics in strain bm4165 were carried  on plasmids pip819 and pip821, respectively; pip819 also carried genes that encoded resistance to mls antibiotics. the two plasmids, which were distinct although related, were self-transferable to other e. faecium strains. plasmid pip819 could also conjugate to e. faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, s. pyogenes, s. lactis, and listeria monocytogenes, in which it conferred inducible glycopeptide resistance, but not to s. aureus. glycopeptide-inactivating activity was not detected, and the biochemical mechanism of resistance remains unknown. based on this first report of transferable resistance to glycopeptides, we anticipate dissemination of resistance to these antibiotics in gram-positive cocci and bacilli in which it can be phenotypically expressed.

TI  == some properties of streptococcus faecalis subsp. liquefaciens isolated from cheese with special reference to production of bitterness.
AB  == streptococcus faecalis subsp. liquefaciens was examined for proteolysis and development of bitterness in sterile buffaloes' skim milk with and without some additives. cell population and the ph of milk were the most important factors in  the breakdown of casein and development of bitterness. sodium chloride level, altering the final concentration of bacteria in milk, had a direct role in the production of bitter peptides. calcium ions up to 5 mm did not affect proteolysis whereas higher concentrations were inhibitory. electrophoretic analysis of proteose-peptone formed in sterile skim milk with and without nacl revealed the presence of 3 peptides, 2 of which were probably associated with bitterness. s. faecalis subsp. liquefaciens produced acidity slowly, but was the most acid producer (1.25% after 72 h) of the streptococci. however, milk coagulated enzymatically and the curd shrinkage was related to salt-dependent acidity. strains of the organism coagulated fresh citrated human plasma within 21 h at 30  degrees c, but without any visible fibrinolysis. the strains also were all alpha-haemolytic with occasionally a very few beta-haemolytic variants on sheep blood agar. on human blood agar, a weak alpha-reaction was given.

AB  == a purified peptide antibiotic as-48 from streptococcus faecalis spp liquiefaciens s-48 exerted a bactericidal mode of action against most gram-positive and many gram-negative bacteria tested. in many gram-positive bacteria and the two myxococcus species assayed, a bacteriolytic effect, as a consequence of primary lesions, was also observed. in general, the gram-negative bacteria were more resistant to as-48. escherichia coli protoplasts showed increased sensitivity and those of a resistant yeast. saccharomyces cerevisiae 3.2, became sensitive. these data suggest that resistance is related to the cell wall structure. as-48 adsorbed rapidly to cell walls and cytoplasmic membranes of sensitive and resistant cells. adsorption to cytoplasmic membranes involved complete neutralization of as-48.

AB  == the differences in the synergistic potential for either killing effect or increase in duration of post-antibiotic effect (pae) seen with various beta-lactam-aminoglycoside combinations in two strains of streptococcus faecalis  were further studied to examine this relationship in more detail. it was seen that a strain which produced a synergistic increase in recovery period (pae greater than or equal to 0.5 h), comparing the beta-lactam antibiotics alone and  when combined with streptomycin, showed increased sensitivity (greater than or equal to 1 log10 reduction in viable counts) to a subinhibitory concentration of  streptomycin added to a culture recovering from the pae; this was not demonstrated with a strain showing no increase in pae when briefly exposed to a combination therapy, although its corresponding killing curve was clearly synergistic. moreover, it was seen that the differences in the synergistic prolongation of recovery period when combining various aminoglycosides at 1/4 x mic with ampicillin were consistent with the different duration of pae with the particular aminoglycoside alone at the mic.

AB  == the influence of various incubation conditions on synergism with cell wall-active agents combined with streptomycin was studied in a streptococcus faecalis strain. it could be shown that both a synergistic increased killing effect and a synergistic prolongation of post-antibiotic effect (pae) were not dependent on an active process, as they occurred both in an anaerobic atmosphere and when an electron transport inhibitor (sodium azide) was added to the media. moreover, it  was demonstrated that if a drug, alone or in combination with streptomycin, had a pae, there was an increased susceptibility to a subinhibitory concentration of streptomycin (1/4xmic) when added to a culture recovering from its pae. these findings confirm the commonly held belief in a mechanistic mechanism of synergism: that cell wall-active agents modify in some way the cell-envelope, thereby enhancing aminoglycoside uptake and killing in streptococcus faecalis.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == fk482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. it displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (cfix), cefaclor (ccl) or cephalexin (cex) against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci including staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the streptococcus group. moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococcus faecalis. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, fk482  had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of cfix but superior to that of ccl or cex. however, it was clearly inferior to cfix in activity against serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. strains of s. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to fk482. all tested strains of klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to ccl and cex were susceptible to fk482, as were all the strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (ampc). fk482, like cfix, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of ccl or cex. the antibacterial activity of fk482 against csh2  strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. fk482 showed higher affinity  for the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) (3, 2 and 1) of s. aureus than did cfix, ccl and cex. fk482 also showed very high affinity for the pbps (2 and 3) of e. faecalis and pbps (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of e. coli. the bactericidal activity of fk482 against s. aureus was almost as strong as that of ampc and superior to that of ccl or cex. against gram-negative bacteria such as e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis, fk482 was similar to cfix and superior to ccl and cex in bactericidal activity.

TI  == in vivo antibacterial activity of fk482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == the therapeutic activities of orally administered fk482 were compared with those  of reference antibiotics against systemic and local infections with a variety of  bacteria in mice and rabbits. in systemic infections in mice, oral fk482 was almost as effective as oral cefaclor (ccl) and more effective than oral cephalexin (cex) against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis infections. however, fk482 afforded superior protective activity when given subcutaneously against e. coli infection in mice,  and this activity was more potent than that of subcutaneously given ccl. in comparison with ccl, the reason that the in vivo activity of orally given fk482 against mouse systemic infections was weaker than had been anticipated from its potent in vitro activity was due to its poor oral absorption in mice. in local infections in rabbits, a species in which fk482 was better absorbed than in mice, fk482 was more effective than ccl, cex or amoxicillin (ampc). against pneumonia induced by s. aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, fk482 was as effective as ampc and more effective than ccl in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the lungs of infected rabbits. in the oral treatment of experimental ascending pyelonephritis in rabbits, fk482 was superior to ccl and ampc against methicillin-resistant s. aureus infection, as effective as ampc and more effective than ccl against enterococcus faecalis infection, and as effective as cefixime (cfix) and more effective than ccl and ampc against e. coli infection in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the kidneys and urine.

TI  == antibiotic resistance and production of inhibitory substances among bacterial strains isolated from the oral cavities of balb/c mice.
AB  == in the oral cavities of balb/c mice, microbial population levels are regulated by multifactorial processes. factors include the production of inhibitory substances and the exchange of genetic material. in this work, 371 isolates from different sites (saliva, tongue, teeth, and mucosa) of the oral cavities of balb/c mice were screened for resistance to antibiotics and antimicrobial activity. antibiotic-resistant strains represented 25% of the total flora. among the predominant species, all the s. faecalis isolates showed multiresistance, and 23% of the lactobacillus murinus isolates and 15% of the staphylococcus aureus were resistant to at least one antibiotic. resistance to aminoglycosides (neomycin, streptomycin, kanamycin, and gentamicin) was most frequently encountered. in s. faecalis, high levels of resistance were recorded to neomycin and streptomycin but not to gentamicin or kanamycin. macrolides (m), lincosamides (l), streptogramin b (s), tetracycline (tc), and chloramphenicol (cm) resistance was also present in multiresistance patterns, especially among s. faecalis isolates.  hemolytic (hly+) streptococci were less resistant to mls, tc, and cm than were non-hemolytic (hly-) isolates. resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics was detected only among staphylococci and with a low prevalence (4%). the frequencies of strains producing antimicrobial substances against the indicator strains (s. mutans lg-1, s. sanguis ny 101, and a. viscosus ny 1) were high for l. murinus (76%) and s. faecalis (57% for hly- and 90% for hly+), but low for s. aureus (7%). these results indicate that the indigenous oral flora could interfere with  colonization by allochthonous micro-organisms and that resistance patterns should be taken into account for the elimination of the oral indigenous flora by antibiotic treatment.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == one strain each of escherichia coli and streptococcus faecalis were exposed to amikacin and ampicillin in combination as well as in succession. exposure to ampicillin for 1 hr followed by amikacin for 3 or 4 hr had the greatest antibacterial activity when the antibiotics were applied in succession. the least effective exposures for both organisms were 1 hr to amikacin followed by 3 or 4 hr to ampicillin. exposure to the antibiotics in combination each at 1 mic had the overall greatest antibacterial activity. simultaneous exposure to the antibiotic combination does not necessarily mean simultaneous activity of both ampicillin and amikacin on the e. coli. the cell wall autolytic activities produced by ampicillin are triggered within 10 min after physical contact with the bacteria. in contrast, amikacin requires at least 30 min after physical contact to manifest its activity on the ribosome. although physical exposure to both antibiotics in the combination is simultaneous, the specific activity of each is in fact sequential, with ampicillin acting first. this explains the synergistic effect of the combination. it appears, therefore, that the synergistic or antagonistic affect of a drug combination is determined by the sequence and timing of the antibacterial manifestations of its components.

TI  == laboratory detection of high-level aminoglycoside-aminocyclitol resistance in enterococcus spp.
AB  == methods for detection of high-level resistance to aminoglycoside-aminocyclitol antibiotics were evaluated using 104 blood isolates of enterococci (97 enterococcus faecalis and 7 enterococcus faecium). kanamycin was used to predict  resistance to amikacin. discrepancies between methods were resolved by time-kill  studies. four methods (microscan, macrotube, microtiter, and disk diffusion) for  detecting resistance to gentamicin and streptomycin were compared, using 51 consecutive strains. there were 13 gentamicin-resistant strains, all of which were detected by macrotube, microtiter, and disk diffusion. microscan detected 2  (15%) of the 13. of the 18 streptomycin-resistant strains, 17 (93%) were detected by disk diffusion, 16 (89%) by microtiter, 9 (50%) by macrotube, and 6 (33%) by microscan. an additional 53 consecutive strains were examined only by disk diffusion and microtiter for resistance to gentamicin, streptomycin, and kanamycin. the entire population of 104 strains contained 35 gentamicin-, 22 streptomycin-, and 54 kanamycin-resistant enterococcal isolates. all 35 gentamicin-resistant strains were detected by both methods. of the 22 streptomycin-resistant strains, 1 was detected only by microtiter, 2 only by disk diffusion, and 19 by both methods. of the 54 kanamycin-resistant strains, 1 was detected only by microtiter, 2 only by disk diffusion, and 51 by both methods. one additional strain which was resistant only by disk diffusion was susceptible  to amikacin plus penicillin by time-kill studies. disk diffusion is a suitable method for detection of high-level aminoglycoside-aminocyclitol resistance in e.  faecalis and is well suited for sporadic testing. additional data are necessary to determine the suitability of these tests for e. faecium.

TI  == microbiological investigation of an outbreak of bacteraemia due to streptococcus  faecalis in an intensive care unit.
AB  == an increased incidence of bacteraemia due to streptococcus faecalis in a critical care and trauma centre (cctc) during november 1985 prompted investigation. during the epidemic 21 blood cultures from five cctc patients were positive for s. faecalis. a point prevalence culture survey revealed two more strains from wounds from two of these five patients. fifteen strains from blood cultures and the two  strains from wound sites were further characterized by conventional biotyping methods and susceptibility patterns, but they could not be differentiated from 40 unrelated control strains by these methods. the api-20s and the api-zym systems,  however, were able to distinguish the outbreak isolates from the control strains. this investigation supports the hypothesis that s. faecalis is capable of causing cross-infection, and it may be necessary to characterize enterococci beyond routine tests to identify an outbreak due to this organism.

TI  == cloning and expression of genes encoding pheromone-inducible antigens of enterococcus (streptococcus) faecalis.
AB  == fragments, generated by restriction enzyme digestion, of the 58-kilobase enterococcus (streptococcus) faecalis tetracycline resistance plasmid pcf10 were  cloned and introduced into escherichia coli and e. faecalis to characterize the pheromone-inducible conjugation system encoded by this plasmid. western blot (immunoblot) analyses revealed that a 130-kilodalton (kda) antigen, identical to  the tra130 antigen shown previously to be involved in pcf10-mediated pheromone-inducible surface exclusion, was produced by both bacterial hosts carrying the recombinant plasmid piny1825 (cloned ecori c fragment). both bacterial hosts carrying piny1825 also produced various amounts of immunologically related 118- to 125-kda antigens (designated pre-tra130) that resembled antigens produced by e. faecalis cells carrying pcf10. an additional 150-kda antigen, tra150, probably involved in pheromone-induced cellular aggregation, was produced by escherichia coli and e. faecalis hosts carrying piny1801 (cloned ecori c and e fragments). the coding sequences for the tra150 and tra130 antigens were further localized in the tra region of pcf10 by transposon insertion mutagenesis. western blot analyses of the recombinant strains, and of strains carrying derivatives of pcf10 or various recombinant plasmids containing tn5 or tn917 insertions, suggested that the portion of pcf10  comprising the tra3 through -6 segments (previously defined by tn917 insertional  mutagenesis) contained several genes that are involved in regulating the synthesis of tra130 and tra150.

TI  == structure of ccf10, a peptide sex pheromone which induces conjugative transfer of the streptococcus faecalis tetracycline resistance plasmid, pcf10.
AB  == the peptide pheromone, ccf10, which induces aggregation and high frequency plasmid transfer in streptococcus faecalis cells carrying the tetracycline resistance plasmid, pcf10, was isolated and its structure determined. the molecular weight of ccf10 is 789, and its amino acid sequence is h-leu-val-thr-leu-val-phe-val-oh. pheromone activity, as determined by a clumping induction assay, was detectable at a concentration of 2.5 x 10(-11) m. a peptide  of the same sequence as that of the ccf10 produced by s. faecalis cells was synthesized by the liquid-phase method. the synthetic pheromone showed biological activity and chromatographic behavior that was identical to that of the ccf10 of  bacterial origin. when the response of s. faecalis cells to various concentrations of synthetic ccf10 was monitored by measuring both the frequency of plasmid transfer and the synthesis of pheromone-inducible antigens, an excellent correlation was observed between donor ability and the appearance of a  150-kilodalton protein that appears to be involved in formation of mating aggregates. the dose-response data in the range of concentrations where the amount of pheromone became limiting (10(-11)-10(-12) m) were consistent with the  notion that as few as one or two molecules per donor cell may be sufficient to induce a mating response.

TI  == active potassium extrusion regulated by intracellular ph in streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == potassium extrusion in bacteria is thought to play a role in the regulation of the cytoplasmic ph; in several organisms, it has been ascribed to secondary antiport of k+ for protons. streptococcus faecalis exhibited a distinctive pattern: potassium extrusion occurred only when the cytoplasmic ph was alkaline and required the generation of atp. the key observation is that glycolyzing cells suspended in an alkaline medium extruded k+, even against a k+ concentration gradient, provided the medium contained a weak permeant base (e.g. diethanolamine or methylamine). the amines render the cytoplasmic ph alkaline; when conditions were arranged to keep the cytoplasm neutral, no k+ extrusion was seen. potassium  extrusion required the presence of either glucose or arginine and was unaffected  by protonophores and by inhibition of the f1fo-atpase. when the medium contained  [14c]methylamine, the cells accumulated the base to an extent stoichiometrically  equivalent to the k+ lost. concurrently, the cytoplasmic ph fell from 8.8 to 7.6, at which point k+ extrusion ceased. the results suggest that k+ extrusion is due  to an atp-driven transport system that expels k+ by exchange for h+ and is active only at alkaline cytoplasmic ph.

TI  == [clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of cefoperazone. evaluation of disc susceptibility test and its interpretation system].
AB  == to interpret of the cefoperazone (cpz) disc susceptibility test, a 4 category system is used in japan, but a 3 category system is used in the u.s.a. and europe. in the 4 category interpretation system of showa cpz disc the following classification is used: ( ) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 3 approximately 15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15 approximately 60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml. in the 3 category system the classification used is as follows: susceptible mic less than  or equal to 16 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible mic greater than 16 approximately 32 micrograms/ml, resistant mic greater than 32 micrograms/ml, or susceptible mic less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible mic greater than 32 approximately 64 micrograms/ml, resistant mic greater than 64 micrograms/ml, depending on dose levels, 1 or 2 g. reliability of the cpz disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate mics by classifying the test results into 4 categories was studied using discs containing 1, 2, 5, 10, 30 and  75 micrograms. the mics were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. a good negative correlation was observed between  inhibitory zone diameters and mics, showing reliability of the test using these discs. the results obtained with discs containing 30 or 75 micrograms of cpz were well categorized into the 4 groups mentioned above. some strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis, however, showed false positive results. when different break points of inhibitory zone diameters than those used for other bacteria were used for p. aeruginosa, and e. faecalis was excluded from the test, an excellent correlations were obtained. with 30 or 75 micrograms discs, it was unable to subclassify strains against which mics of cpz were below 3 micrograms/ml. however, with discs containing 1 to 10 micrograms, it was possible to separate the strains against which mics were less than 0.5 microgram/ml. the fact that most frequent values of mics of cpz against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus spp., haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pyogenes etc. were less than 0.5 microgram/ml supports the usefulness of low dose discs. according to recently ongoing concepts on the pharmacokinetics of antibiotics and their penetration into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding appear to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body. only free, unbound drug molecules can readily pass through capillary pores into tissue fluids except into hepatic biliary system.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == chemotactic and chemokinetic activity of streptococcus faecalis culture supernatant for equine neutrophils.
AB  == although equine neutrophils did not respond towards formylated methionyl peptides, streptococcus faecalis culture supernatant caused an in vitro stimulation of equine neutrophil motility when measured by an under-agarose assay. the migration of neutrophils towards the culture supernatant increased sigmoidally with the logarithmic concentration of the culture supernatant in the  chemoattractant wells. the streptococcal culture supernatant was chemokinetic because it stimulated the random motility of the phagocytes. because granulocytes migrated further towards the supernatant than could be explained by the chemokinetic activity of the bacterial products, the streptococcal culture fluid  also exerted a chemotactic effect on the leukocytes. the chemotactic activity of  the supernatant was further confirmed by the changes in the orientation of the migrating cells during incubation. these results indicate that bacteria produce cytotaxins other than formylmethionyl peptides which are recognized by equine neutrophils.

TI  == high-level resistance to gentamicin in clinical isolates of streptococcus (enterococcus) faecium.
AB  == during a 14-month period beginning in july 1986, three distinct clinical isolates of streptococcus (enterococcus) faecium demonstrating high-level resistance (mic, greater than 2,000 micrograms/ml) to gentamicin, kanamycin, tobramycin, and streptomycin were recovered from individual patients at one institution. combinations of ampicillin with any of these agents failed to show bactericidal synergism. by filter-mating techniques, high-level gentamicin resistance could be transferred into a susceptible recipient of the same species at frequencies as high as 1 x 10(-4); transfer into streptococcus faecalis jh2-7 occurred at lower  frequencies (less than 2 x 10(-7). aminoglycoside substrate profile analysis of clinical isolates as well as of laboratory-derived cured strains and transconjugants revealed 2"-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase and 3'-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (iii) phosphorylating enzymes, aac-6' acetylating activity above that attributable to the intrinsic activity characteristic of s. faecium, and a streptomycin adenylylating enzyme. all three  isolates carried a 51-megadalton plasmid. curing of this plasmid or conjugative transfer into susceptible recipients was associated with the loss or acquisition  of high-level gentamicin resistance, respectively. loss of high-level gentamicin  resistance was also observed when curing techniques resulted in a decrease in the size of this plasmid equivalent to a 10-megadalton deletion. transferable, high-level resistance to gentamicin and other aminoglycosides, which was previously recognized in s. faecalis, has now emerged in clinical isolates of s.  faecium, with the attendant concerns for possible spread.

TI  == regulation of the pad1 sex pheromone response in enterococcus faecalis: construction and characterization of lacz transcriptional fusions in a key control region of the plasmid.
AB  == strains carrying the enterococcus (formerly streptococcus) faecalis plasmid pad1  responded to exogenous sex pheromone by inducing a number of gene products which  facilitated mating. a 7-kilobase region of pad1 was identified which contained genes that are important for the regulation of this response. using the transposon tn917-lac delivery vector ptv32ts, we generated a number of fusions that allowed us to examine transcription in this region. at least three transcriptional units were identified by grouping fusions by their phenotype, direction of transcription, and response to pheromone. transcription from one set of fusions was sensitive to the presence of pheromone. analysis of the patterns of protein production previously shown to be induced in the presence of pheromone provided more information on the function of the genes of interest. we postulate  the existence of two negative regulatory proteins that act coordinately to repress the pheromone response, one of which may be involved in sensing or transmitting the pheromone signal, and at least one positive regulatory protein whose synthesis is dependent on the presence of pheromone. in addition, the isolation of a relatively small deletion mutant capable of producing cad1. the pheromone specific for pad1-containing cells, indicates that a factor(s) that is  important for the shutdown of endogenous pheromone is also present in this region.

TI  == novel streptococcal mutants defective in the regulation of h+-atpase biosynthesis and in f0 complex.
AB  == in streptococcus faecalis (faecium), the cytoplasmic ph is regulated by proton extrusion via a proton translocating f1f0-atpase; the level of this enzyme increases in response to cytoplasmic acidification (kobayashi, h., suzuki, t., and unemoto, t. (1986) j. biol. chem. 261, 627-630). we describe here two novel acid-sensitive mutants, designated as8 and as17, that contain atpase activity but fail to grow on acid media. our data suggested that in mutant as17, acidification of the cytoplasm stimulates synthesis of the f0 sector of the atpase but not the  f1 sector. the accumulation in the plasma membrane of f0 sectors devoid of f1 results in enhanced proton permeability, and as a consequence mutant as17 is unable to regulate the cytoplasmic ph in acid media. the genetic defect may reside in a gene that regulates expression of the f1f0-atpase. mutant as8 does not generate a proton motive force. our results suggest that the f1f0-atpase can  hydrolyze atp but fails to translocate protons due to a defect in one of the subunits of the f0 sector.

AB  == thromboxane-associated pulmonary hypertension occurs in animals during intravenous infusion of group b streptococcus (gbs), a gram-positive neonatal pathogen. we postulated that other gram-positive neonatal pathogens, such as streptococcus fecalis (ent) and staphylococcus epidermidis (s. epi) would also induce increased thromboxane synthesis and pulmonary hypertension when infused into piglets. we observed similar hemodynamic and gas exchange abnormalities during stepwise increases in the dose of gbs, ent, and s. epi (n = 3, 4, and 4 piglets receiving each bacteria, respectively). pulmonary vascular resistance increased significantly in the absence of acidosis or reduced arterial or mixed venous po2 at a dose of 2.5 x 10(8) cfu/kg/h for ent and s. epi. in 14 additional piglets, pulmonary vascular resistance increased markedly after 60 min of intravenous infusion of 4 +/- 1 x 10(8) cfu/kg/h for each organism (p less than 0.05, gbs: 11.7 +/- 1.8 to 75.6 +/- 18.4 mm hg/liter/min, ent: 12.7 +/- 1.7 to 64.9 +/- 10.6 mm hg/liter/min, s. epi: 10.5 +/- 0.8 to 56.9 +/- 6.0 mm hg/liter/min), and blood thromboxane b2 levels increased (p less than 0.05, gbs:  30 +/- 10 to 1830 +/- 330 pg/ml, ent: 20 +/- 7 to 1110 +/- 300 pg/ml, s. epi: 31  +/- 9 to 1260 +/- 350 pg/ml). this dose of each bacteria caused a similar degree  of mild arterial hypoxemia (57-66 mm hg). the thromboxane synthetase inhibitor, dazmegrel, completely reversed pulmonary hypertension, reduced txb2 levels to near baseline values, and partially reversed arterial hypoxemia despite ongoing bacterial infusion. we conclude that thromboxane-associated pulmonary hypertension occurs in piglets during infusion of different gram-positive neonatal pathogens.

AB  == this study compared daptomycin (ly146032) with penicillin g procaine and vancomycin without and with gentamicin for treatment of experimental enterococcal endocarditis. the strain of streptococcus (enterococcus) faecalis used in this study was killed by daptomycin in vitro in broth but not in serum. in rabbits treated for 3 days, daptomycin significantly reduced bacterial counts of vegetations compared with no therapy but was significantly less effective than penicillin g procaine or vancomycin. daptomycin-gentamicin significantly reduced  bacterial counts of vegetations compared with daptomycin alone but was significantly less effective than vancomycin plus gentamicin. the efficacy of daptomycin-gentamicin did not differ significantly from that of penicillin g procaine-gentamicin. the lack of enterococcal killing by daptomycin alone in serum and in experimental endocarditis is probably related to the high protein binding of the agent.

TI  == evidence for a single active-site cysteinyl residue in the streptococcal nadh peroxidase.
AB  == substrate reduction of the streptococcal flavoprotein nadh peroxidase, followed by anaerobic denaturation and titration with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate), yields a stoichiometry of one protein thiol per mole of fad. analysis of the nadh peroxidase, purified from cultures of streptococcus faecalis 10cl grown on a chemically-defined medium containing [35s]cysteine, confirms the stoichiometry of one cysteinyl residue per subunit and allows the isolation and sequencing of the  corresponding cysteinyl peptide. the amino acid sequence of the single cysteinyl  peptide thus identified shows a striking difference from the active-site cysteinyl peptides of the flavoprotein disulfide and dimercaptide reductases.

TI  == renal pharmacokinetic changes of gentamicin during enterococcal pyelonephritis.
AB  == in the present study, the renal pharmacokinetics of gentamicin was investigated in pyelonephritic rats infected with streptococcus (enterococcus) faecalis. four  days after the induction of infection, animals were given either a single dose of gentamicin or two daily injections for 7 days. the treated animals were evaluated from 1 h to 6 months posttreatment. after a single injection, limited pharmacokinetic variations were observed, whereas after 14 injections infected kidneys demonstrated significantly higher concentrations and a more extended renal elimination phase of the antibiotic. analysis of the area under the curve of the concentration in kidney versus time showed more marked renal accumulation  by the infected and long-term treated animals than by normal animals or those receiving only one injection of aminoglycoside. renal function remained normal in both the infected and normal animals treated with this aminoglycoside. these results demonstrate that s. faecalis pyelonephritis disturbs the renal handling of gentamicin and may increase the susceptibility of the kidney to aminoglycosides.

AB  == the response to three quinolones of a clinical isolate of streptococcus faecalis  was studied by continuous turbidimetric monitoring, by viable counting, and in an in-vitro model of the treatment of bacterial cystitis. dense populations (c. 8 x  10(6) cfu/ml) responded to ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and enoxacin at concentrations below the conventionally determined mic, but variants, shown to exhibit decreased susceptibility, emerged during overnight incubation. the variants were cross-resistant to each of the three quinolones, but the resistance was lost on subculture in drug-free broth. at a concentration of ten-fold mic, ciprofloxacin was more bactericidal than norfloxacin or enoxacin. in experiments  in the bladder model, doses of ciprofloxacin achieving a peak concentration of 10, 50 or 250 mg/l suppressed bacterial growth for 20 h or more. the doses of norfloxacin or enoxacin required to achieve a comparable effect were higher than  those of ciprofloxacin. a reduction in susceptibility, as judged by comparative disc testing, occurred after two cycles of exposure to norfloxacin or enoxacin in experiments in which the peak concentration achieved was 50 mg/l, but not when the peak was 250 mg/l. reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin developed only in  experiments in which a lower peak concentration of 10 mg/l was achieved.

TI  == evidence for natural gene transfer from gram-positive cocci to escherichia coli.
AB  == high-level resistance to macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin type b (mls) antibiotics in escherichia coli bm2570 is due to the presence on the conjugative  plasmid pip1527 of the mls resistance determinant ermbc, which is almost identical to the erm genes previously described in plasmid pam77 from streptococcus sanguis (ermam) and in transposon tn917 from enterococcus faecalis  (ermb). this gene and its regulatory region are located downstream from the insertion sequence is1. the 23s rrna methylase encoded by pip1527 differs by three and six amino acids from those encoded by tn917 and pam77, respectively. unlike the streptococcal elements which confer the inducible mls phenotype, the ermbc gene is expressed constitutively in e. coli and bacillus subtilis, due to several mutations in the regulatory region. transcription of the ermbc gene starts from three different sites following three overlapping promoters which function in both e. coli and b. subtilis. promoters p2 and p3 are located within  the region homologous to pam77 and tn917, and p1 is a hybrid promoter constituted by -35 and -10 sequences located at the end of is15 and in the streptococcal region, respectively. these results constitute evidence for the recent in vivo transfer from streptococcus spp. to e. coli. this transfer could have been mediated by transposons such as tn917 or tn1545 from streptococcus pneumoniae, which also bears an mls determinant that is homologous to ermb. we speculate that the insertion sequences is15 and is1 could have played a role in the expression and dissemination of ermbc, which has been found in numerous strains of enterobacteria.

TI  == impact of ly146032 on streptococcus (enterococcus) faecalis translocation in mice.
AB  == the susceptibility of swiss white mice to colonization with streptococcus (enterococcus) faecalis was greatly increased when the animals were given 5 mg of streptomycin sulfate per ml in their drinking water. one week after initiation of streptomycin treatment, the mice were challenged orogastrically with graded doses of streptomycin-resistant s. faecalis. the number of s. faecalis cells required to implant the intestinal tract of 50% of untreated mice was 2.9 x 10(9), but was only 4.8 x 10(3) for streptomycin-treated animals. when both groups of mice were  challenged orogastrically with 4.6 x 10(6) viable s. faecalis cells, the cecum and small intestine of 100% of the streptomycin-treated animals, but only 10% of  the untreated animals, were colonized with the organism. similarly, translocation of s. faecalis to extraintestinal sites occurred in a majority of streptomycin-treated mice, but in only a small number of untreated mice. subcutaneous administration of the experimental antibiotic ly146032 (eli lilly &  co., indianapolis, ind.) to streptomycin-treated mice concomitant with orogastric challenge with 5.5 x 10(5) viable s. faecalis cells resulted in a significant decrease in the incidence of intestinal colonization by the organism, a significant reduction in s. faecalis populations, and the absence of the organism in the liver, spleen, and heart. however, once intestinal colonization had occurred and extraintestinal infections were established, ly146032 did not significantly reduce s. faecalis populations or ameliorate the infections. we conclude that ly146032 effectively prevents translocation of s. faecalis from the intestinal tract of mice but does not resolve established extraintestinal infections.

TI  == kinetic mechanism and nucleotide specificity of nadh peroxidase.
AB  == nadh peroxidase is a flavoprotein isolated from streptococcus faecalis which catalyzes the pyridine nucleotide-dependent reduction of hydrogen peroxide to water. initial velocity, product, and dead-end inhibition studies have been performed at ph 7.5 and support a ping-pong kinetic mechanism. in the absence of  hydrogen peroxide, both transhydrogenation between nadh and thionad, and isotope  exchange between [14c]nadh and nad, have been demonstrated, although in both these experiments, the maximal velocity of nucleotide exchange was less than 1.5% the maximal velocity of the peroxidatic reaction. we propose that nadh binds tightly to both oxidized and two-electron reduced enzyme. nadh oxidation proceeds stereospecifically with the transfer of the 4s hydrogen to enzyme, and then, via  exchange, to water. no primary tritium kinetic isotope effect was observed, and no statistically significant primary deuterium kinetic isotope effects on v/k were determined, although primary deuterium kinetic isotope effects on v were observed in the presence and absence of sodium acetate. nadh peroxidase thus shares with other flavoprotein reductases striking kinetic, spectroscopic, and stereochemical similarities. on this basis, we propose a chemical mechanism for the peroxide cleaving reaction catalyzed by nadh peroxidase which involves the obligate formation of a flavinperoxide, and peroxo bond cleavage by nucleophilic  attack by enzymatic dithiols.

AB  == streptococcus faecalis usually requires high concentrations of penicillin or ampicillin to achieve killing (i.e. a high mbc/mic ratio). however, most strains  show the eagle or paradoxical effect. we subjected 12 strains of s. faecalis to 0.1, 1, 10 and 100 micrograms/ml of amoxicillin. turbidometry studies have shown  that 3 h after the inactivation of amoxicillin by penicillinase, there was a longer effect for 1 micrograms/ml following beta-lactamase (12 h 31 min +/- 2 h 09 min) than for 10 micrograms/ml (7 h 0 min +/- 1 h 12 min) or 100 micrograms/ml (5 h 22 min +/- 0 h 52 min). after 3 h, the reduction of cfu/ml (inoculum 10(6) cfu/ml) was -1.8 +/- 0.6 for 1 micrograms/ml, -0.56 +/- 0.56 for 10 micrograms/ml and -0.21 +/- 0.20 for 100 micrograms/ml. the more rapid killing at 3 h was not the only reason for the longer effect following beta-lactamase observed with 1 micrograms/ml. indeed, the growth curve obtained with an inoculum of 10(3) cfu/ml was 2 h delayed from the control curve (10(6) cfu/ml). in conclusion, a paradoxical effect (killing curves and effect following beta-lactamase) was observed for all s. faecalis strains included in this series.

TI  == comparative in-vitro activity of erythromycin, vancomycin and pristinamycin.
AB  == we have studied the in-vitro activity of erythromycin, vancomycin and pristinamycin against 1,006 clinical isolates comprising streptococci, staphylococci, neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus influenzae and anaerobes. in-vitro studies show pristinamycin to inhibit staphylococci and streptococci, including erythromycin highly-resistant organisms, at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l. although pristinamycin's mean mic for streptococci is higher than that of erythromycin, pristinamycin is bactericidal, whereas erythromycin is bacteristatic against streptococcus agalactiae and oral streptococci. enterococci were less uniformly susceptible to pristinamycin: 58 of the 94 enterococcus faecalis tested were resistant (mic greater than or equal to  3.12 mg/l). 14 of the 15 isolates of enterococcus faecium were inhibited by less  than or equal to 1.56 mg/l pristinamycin. pristinamycin showed poor activity against haemophilus influenzae (mode mic 1.56 and mic90 of 3.12 mg/l) but all except two of the 100 neisseria gonorrhoeae tested were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l pristinamycin. pristinamycin inhibited all nine clostridium spp. at less than or equal to 0.39 mg/l and 38 of 40 strains of anaerobic gram-positive cocci at less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l. it was less effective against the bacteroides fragilis group: (mic90 3.12 mg/l). pristinamycin had poor bactericidal activity against the anaerobes tested.

TI  == comparative killing activity and postantibiotic effect of streptomycin combined with ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, piperacillin or vancomycin against strains of streptococcus faecalis and streptococcus faecium.
AB  == nine strains of streptococcus faecalis and streptococcus faecium were studied with respect to ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, piperacillin, vancomycin and streptomycin. two strains were highly resistant (mic greater than or equal to 2,000 micrograms/ml) to streptomycin. evaluation and comparison of the killing activity with killing curves, and duration of the postantibiotic effect (pae) after exposure for 1 h with regrowth curves was done with combinations of antibiotics or alone. the overall killing effect of ciprofloxacin with streptomycin was antagonistic, whereas synergism (greater than or equal to one log10 decrease in viable counts) was observed in streptomycin-susceptible strains with combinations of streptomycin and ampicillin, imipenem, piperacillin or vancomycin. in addition, prolongation of pae (greater than or equal to 0.5 h) was seen only in streptomycin-susceptible strains. thus, seven (100%) strains showed  a synergistic increase in pae to combinations with ampicillin and vancomycin, three (43%) to imipenem, four (57%) to piperacillin, but none to the combination  of streptomycin and ciprofloxacin. a significant correlation was observed between the magnitude of increased killing and the extent of increase in recovery period  with combinations of streptomycin with either ampicillin or vancomycin.

TI  == impact of cefotaxime and ceftriaxone on the bowel and vaginal flora after single-dose prophylaxis in vaginal hysterectomy.
AB  == the aim of this randomised controlled study was to investigate the effect of a preoperative, single dose, intravenous injection of ceftriaxone 2g and cefotaxime 2g in 2 groups of 30 patients who underwent vaginal hysterectomy. the parameters  were: efficacy and tolerance; impact on the aerobic bowel and vaginal flora; and  serum concentrations. there were no significant differences in efficacy, haematology or clinical chemistry parameters. in the ceftriaxone group 2 patients had exanthemas, 2 had diarrhoea. in the cefotaxime group no such side effects occurred. serum concentrations were 9.75 and 0.07 mg/l for ceftriaxone and cefotaxime, respectively, after 24 and 12 hours, respectively. ceftriaxone had a  pronounced and continuous effect on the bowel flora: streptococcus faecium and candida spp. increased, reaching counts of 10(8) and 10(7) organisms/g faeces, respectively, at day 10. under cefotaxime no dramatic alteration was determined and growth of candida spp. was not influenced. growth of escherichia coli and other bacteria of the vaginal flora was not influenced by either drug. overgrowth of candida spp. under ceftriaxone was significant (p less than 0.05) compared with that under cefotaxime. the results of this study indicate that the high biliary excretion of ceftriaxone (45%) and its long acting properties are responsible for the high selection pressure and overgrowth of candida. cefotaxime, a drug with low biliary excretion (5%) and shorter action, had only a negligible effect on the microflora with quick normalisation. the observed overgrowth of candida spp., even after a single injection of ceftriaxone, could cause problems when this drug is being used for surgical prophylaxis or treatment. this applies especially to immunocompromised patients.

TI  == establishment of a typing system for group d streptococci.
AB  == group d streptococci (n = 971, 4037 samples, 139 patients) were isolated from two intensive care units. differentiation and typing revealed 6 species, 25 phage types, and 85 enterococcinotypes. distribution of species showed strong differences especially concerning enterococcus faecium which was rarely isolated  from extraintestinal sites (5.9%). phage typing was species specific and discriminated enterococcus faecalis (n = 703 typable isolates, 19 phage types) and the other group d streptococci (n = 63 typable isolates, 6 phage types). based on the production of enterococcines (15 indicator strains used) the isolates could be classified into 6 groups, one of which was further subdivided into 3 subgroups. enterococcus faecalis ssp. liquefaciens (n = 618), phage type v6b (n = 596), and enterococcine group ivc (n = 568) were most common. the combined use of markers resulted in 187 combinations, which demonstrated the valuable properties of the system.

TI  == characterization of the 1-phosphohistidinyl residue in the phosphocarrier protein hpr of the phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system of streptococcus  faecalis.
AB  == the phosphocarrier protein hpr of the bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system contains 1-phosphohistidine at residue 15. this residue and the active site residue arg-17 are conserved in hprs isolated from both gram-positive and -negative bacteria. the ph- and temperature-dependent hydrolysis of the 1-phosphohistidinyl residue in p-hpr from streptococcus faecalis has been investigated. the results show that the hydrolysis properties are very similar to those previously reported for p-hpr from escherichia coli. it was postulated that the unusual hydrolysis properties were due to the presence of a carboxyl group at the active site, and it is now known that in hpr from escherichia coli the c-terminal residue glu-85 is present. the results in this paper suggest that a similar carboxyl group is present at the active site in hpr  from streptococcus faecalis.

TI  == a shift from acute to chronic spontaneous pyelonephritis in male mm mice associated with a change in the causal micro-organisms.
AB  == proteus mirabilis was the predominant cause of acute diabetes-associated pyelonephritis occurring spontaneously in male mm mice until they were segregated in a new environment. thereafter pasteurella pneumotropica and streptococcus faecalis emerged collectively as the most common causal organisms, the pyelonephritis became more chronic and proteus mirabilis isolates from faeces and urine produced atypical non-swarming colonies on blood agar plates. this did not  account for the reduced pathogenicity of proteus mirabilis; when mm males were returned to the original environment the pyelonephritis again became acute but was associated with the atypical type of proteus mirabilis although the normal type was abundant in the environment. the mm mice were caesarean-derived and cross-fostered shortly before their transfer to the second environment, which probably accounts for their changed microbial status, but the reason for the emergence of the atypical type of proteus mirabilis is not understood. the acute  nature of the male mm pyelonephritis when caused by proteus mirabilis parallels the situation described in other animals and humans.

TI  == the effect of growth-promoting antibiotics on the faecal enterococci of healthy young chickens.
AB  == small groups of chickens were given feed containing either avoparcin, nitrovin, virginiamycin or zinc bacitracin from the day of their purchase as day-olds. differences between the birds receiving growth promoters and the untreated controls were observed during the last third of the 23 d survey period. the enterococcal population of the 'dosed' birds contained a greater proportion of enterococcus faecium than did that of the control birds while the converse was true for ent. gallinarum. this apparent selection of ent. faecium by the growth-promoting antibiotics had an influence on the incidence of resistance to therapeutic antibiotics among the enterococcal population as a whole. this was because this species was generally more resistant than ent. gallinarum to cephalothin, the mls antibiotics (erythromycin, lincomycin and tylosin) and tetracycline.

TI  == contribution of the microflora to proteolysis in the human large intestine.
AB  == protease activities in human ileal effluent were approximately 20-fold greater than in normal faeces. comparative studies with faeces from a person who did not  have a pancreas suggested that a substantial proportion of the proteolytic activity in normal faeces was of bacterial origin. thimerosal, iodoacetate, edta  and cysteine significantly inhibited proteolysis in faeces, but not in small intestinal contents, showing that cysteine and metalloproteases were produced by  bacteria in the large gut. these results, together with results from studies using p-nitroanilide substrates, demonstrated that faecal proteolysis was both qualitatively and quantitatively different from that in the small intestine. studies with pure cultures of proteolytic gut bacteria indicated that the cell-bound proteases of bacteroides fragilis-type organisms were likely to contribute significantly towards proteolytic activity associated with the washed  cell fraction and washed particulate fraction of faeces. extracellular proteases  were formed by streptococcus faecalis st6, propionibacterium acnes p6, clostridium perfringens c16, cl. bifermentans c21 and cl. sporogenes c25. inhibition results suggested that these bacteria, and similar organisms, may be partly responsible for the extracellular proteolytic activity found in the cell-free supernatant fraction of faeces.

TI  == effect of streptococcus faecalis on the growth of bacteroides species and anaerobic cocci in mixed infection.
AB  == the relationship between streptococcus faecalis and anaerobic bacteria was studied in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. included in the study were one strain of s. faecalis, three strains each of the bacteroides fragilis group and b. melaninogenicus group, and five strains of anaerobic cocci. the relationship between the organisms was studied by determining the individual change in colony-forming units (cfus) of the two bacterial components that induces abscesses in mice, compared to the cfus of each of the isolated when inoculated alone. of the eleven combinations, the cfus of s. faecalis increased in seven and decreased in two. the cfus of anaerobic bacteria were never increased and were decreased in two. a mutual decrease in growth occurred only in the combinations of s. faecalis and b. melaninogenicus group. this study demonstrates the potential for pathogenicity of s. faecalis in mixed infections with the b. fragilis group and anaerobic cocci.

TI  == use of a glycopeptide antibiotic, teicoplanin, in the treatment of septicaemia caused by gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == teicoplanin, a recently introduced glycopeptide antibiotic, has been used, in combination with other antibiotics, to treat 31 episodes of septicaemia caused by gram-positive organisms. teicoplanin has double the activity of vancomycin against many gram-positive bacteria, but allergic reactions and toxicity appear to be infrequent. a single daily dose is sufficient to maintain therapeutic levels, which is an advantage in conditions requiring long-term treatment. of the 31 episodes treated, 16 were associated with infective endocarditis, 11 with hickman catheter infection, two with bone and joint infection, and two with infection of other indwelling prosthetic devices. staphylococcus epidermidis was  isolated in 18 infections, of which seven treatment courses were unsuccessful. one death occurred from an uncontrolled infection, three deaths from underlying disease (one of which had relapsed twice), and one after withdrawal of treatment  following febrile reaction. eleven episodes were cured. six episodes of staphylococcus aureus septicaemia were treated, of which two failed to respond, two relapsed, one improved and one was cured. the remaining seven episodes were caused by streptococci (including streptococcus faecalis), and in all of them cure was achieved despite the lack of consistent serum bactericidal activity in vitro.

TI  == [comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1985). ii. background of patients].
AB  == we have investigated relationships between patients' backgrounds and isolates from urinary tract infections in reference to various conditions, such as sexes,  age distribution by sex, species of causative organisms by sex, age distribution  according to species and types of infections, species and infections before and after treatment with antibacterial agents, and species and detected places. as for the relationship between sexes and types of infections, although simple urinary tract infections were consistently found at about 20% in men and at about 80% in women between 1981 and 1983, these infections were seen at 24.4% in men and at 75.6% in women in 1984, and at 26.6% and at 73.4% in 1985, indicating slight decreases in the ratio of women. by contrast, complex urinary tract infections were found in men at about 60-70% from 1981 up to 1985, regardless of  the presence or absence of indwelling catheter. there were no noticeable changes  according to age during this 5-year period in incidences of infections including  simple urinary tract infection and complex urinary tract infection with or without indwelling catheter. thus, backgrounds of patients with urinary tract infections, including sex, age and simple or complex infections, were fairly consistent throughout this period, while there were relatively large changes in species of isolates. enterococcus faecalis was isolated at about 8% of both men and women in 1982 and 1983, but its isolation rates were increased to 22.5% of men and 17.9% of women in 1984. in 1985 this species was isolated in 14.9% of men and 7.6% of women, and in 11.2% of all patients. staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus spp. and enterococcus spp. were detected at rates of 3.2%, 8.1%, 0.7% and 1.0%, respectively, and 24.2% of isolated strains were gram-positive organisms. when species of isolates before treatment with antibacterial agents and their isolation rates were analyzed, it was found that the isolation rate of e. faecalis increased dramatically in 1983,  and that this tendency was still seen in 1984. the isolation rate of gram-positive organisms was 25% in 1984 and 24.3% in 1985. escherichia coli was consistently isolated at about 40%, but, as far as simple urinary tract infections are concerned, its isolation rate decreased by about 10% in 1985, compared to 1982 and 1983. these results suggested that causative organisms for simple urinary tract infections became similar to those for complex urinary tract infections. in other words, isolates obtained from complex urinary tract infections before treatment were similar to those of simple infections.(abstract  truncated at 400 words)

AB  == cyst infection in patients with autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (adpkd) is often refractory to therapy, in part because of the limited entry of commonly used antibiotics into cyst fluid. to study the efficacy of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in cyst infection, cyst fluid was obtained by percutaneous aspiration or at surgery from eight patients with adpkd receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. cysts were categorized as nongradient or gradient  by cyst-fluid sodium concentration. trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole concentrations  within cysts were determined and cyst fluid inhibitory and bactericidal titers were assessed in vitro against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and streptococcus fecalis. the mean cyst fluid trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole concentrations were 15.2 micrograms/ml and 42.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. preferential accumulation of trimethoprim was observed in gradient cysts, exceeding serum levels more than eightfold. sulfamethoxazole penetrated cysts to  a lesser extent, with concentrations ranging from 10 to 70 percent of the serum level. cyst fluid sampled prior to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole administration (control) demonstrated no antibacterial activity, while cyst fluid inhibitory and bactericidal titers following antibiotic administration were 1:32 or greater in most instances. these studies indicate that trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is likely to be efficacious in the treatment of cyst infection in polycystic kidneys.

TI  == neonatal enterococcal sepsis: case-control study and description of an outbreak.
AB  == an increased incidence of neonatal sepsis caused by group d streptococci, specifically enterococci (gde), during a recent 6-month period prompted a 5-year  review of enterococcal sepsis in our neonatal intensive care unit. sixteen episodes occurred in 14 babies. gde accounted for 8 of 19 (42%) episodes of neonatal bacteremia during the epidemic period vs. only 8 of 159 (5%) episodes during the remaining 4.5 years (endemic period) (p less than 0.001). blood isolates were all identified as streptococcus faecalis. a combination of three strain-typing methods successfully distinguished the epidemic organisms from endemic nursery strains of gde and from "background" gde flora in the hospital. nursery isolates were all susceptible to ampicillin, intermediate or resistant to the aminoglycosides and variably resistant to the newer cephalosporins. there were no differences in antibiotic susceptibilities of the gde or in characteristics of the patients that were unique to the epidemic. neonates with gde sepsis had a mean birth weight of 913 g, a mean gestational age of 27 weeks and a mean age of onset of sepsis of 8.5 weeks. twenty-five controls, matched for birth weight and admission date, were identified. significant differences (p less than 0.05) between cases and controls included: use of a nonumbilical central line (71 vs. 32%); days central line in place (26.5 vs. 6.5 days); and bowel resection (29 vs. 4%). this is the first reported outbreak of s. faecalis sepsis  in neonates. gde are important nosocomial pathogens that must be considered in late onset neonatal sepsis.

TI  == activity of ly146032 against enterococci with and without high-level aminoglycoside resistance, including two penicillinase-producing strains.
AB  == we tested the activity of ly146032 (ly) against 57 strains of enterococci collected from chile, thailand, and the united states. some of the strains were resistant to high levels of gentamicin or streptomycin (or both), and two produced beta-lactamase (bla+). mics of ly ranged from 0.5 to 8 micrograms/ml, and mbcs ranged from 1 to 64 micrograms/ml. in time-kill assays, a 2 to 3 log10 killing effect was observed with ly against two bla+ strains of streptococcus (enterococcus) faecalis and against three strains that were highly resistant to streptomycin and gentamicin. synergism was demonstrated with ly and streptomycin  against a bla+ strain lacking high-level streptomycin resistance. these in vitro  results suggest that ly should be studied further for possible use in treatment of enterococcal infections.

TI  == responses of chickens to streptococcus faecalis: genotype-housing interactions.
AB  == hens from lines selected for high and low juvenile body weight were maintained in single-bird wire cages or in litter-floor flocks and inoculated intravenously with streptococcus faecalis. responses to the inoculation, as measured by changes in body weight, plasma xanthophyll levels, heterophil/lymphocyte ratios, and mortality, were more severe in the high-body-weight line than the low-body-weight line. the effect of cage vs. floor housing varied according to genetic line. responses of individuals to str. faecalis could not be predicted from either plasma xanthophyll levels or numbers of heterophils and lymphocytes before inoculation. diagnosis of field outbreaks would be difficult, because autopsies performed 14 days after inoculation revealed no lesions, and liver swabs positive for str. faecalis were rare.

TI  == combined use of phage typing, enterococcinotyping and species differentiation of  group d streptococci as an effective epidemiological tool.
AB  == ninety-five group d streptococcal isolates from the feces of 95 healthy persons were compared with 157 group d streptococcal isolates from 38 patients of the surgical intensive care unit (sicu). the typing systems consisted of phage typing, enterococcinotyping and species differentiation. strains isolated from fecal specimens showed high individuality (66 combination types) whereas strains  from the sicu revealed strongly uniform types (32 combination types, three types  comprised 83 isolates, i.e. 52.8%). endogenous colonization was demonstrated by isolation of strains from different locations (throat, trachea, wounds, blood, urine, drains, catheters, and vaginal swabs) from the same patient, and routes of transmission of the same strains to several patients were traced. the combination of three systems revealed a good discrimination between isolates of fecal and extrafecal specimens. the investigation detected highly preferred types in strains of extrafecal origin which were rarely isolated from fecal specimens. this may indicate that only strains with special characters preferably were able  to colonize extraintestinal sites.

TI  == conjugative mobilization as an alternative vector delivery system for lactic streptococci.
AB  == due to the current variability in applying polyethylene glycol-mediated protoplast transformation to lactic streptococci, a study was undertaken to assess the feasibility of conjugative mobilization as an alternative method for vector delivery. by using the broad-host-range conjugative plasmid pva797, the partially homologous cloning vector pva838 was successfully introduced into various strains of streptococcus lactis, streptococcus cremoris, streptococcus lactis subsp. diacetylactis, streptococcus thermophilus, and streptococcus faecalis. frequencies ranged from 10(-2) to 10(-6) transconjugants per recipient. both pva797 and pva838 were acquired intact, without alteration in functionality. also, the shuttle vector psa3, which shares partial homology with pva797, was mobilized via conjugation. the use of s. lactis lm2301 as the intermediate donor  allowed the use of physiologic and metabolic characteristics for recipient differentiation. the construction of a vector containing a "dna cassette" conferring mobilization and the resolution, segregation, and stability of the cointegrates, pva797, pva838, and psa3, are also reported.

TI  == production of staphylococcal enterotoxin in mixed cultures.
AB  == two staphylococcus aureus strains were grown in brain-heart infusion (bhi) broth  and a meat medium with bacillus cereus, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. both s. aureus strains grew well and produced enterotoxin in the presence of s. faecalis in bhi broth; however, enterotoxin production was observable in the meat medium only when the s. aureus inoculum was greater than the s. faecalis inoculum. s. aureus fri-100 grown with b. cereus produced enterotoxin in both media only when the s. aureus inoculum was much higher than the b. cereus inoculum (10 versus 10(4) cfu), whereas s. aureus fri-196e produced enterotoxin in both media at all inoculum combinations except in the meat medium, when the inocula of the two organisms were the same. s. aureus grown with e. coli in bhi broth produced enterotoxin at all inoculum combinations except when the e. coli inoculum was greater than the s. aureus inoculum; however, in the meat medium, enterotoxin was produced only when the s.  aureus inoculum was much greater than the e. coli inoculum (10 versus 10(4) cfu), s. aureus fri-100 grown with p. aeruginosa in either medium produced enterotoxin  only when the s. aureus inoculum was much greater than the p. aeruginosa inoculum (10 versus 10(3) or 10(4) cfu). it can be concluded from these results that enterotoxin production is unlikely in mixed cultures unless the staphylococci outnumber the other contaminating organisms.

AB  == serum samples from patients with endocarditis and septicaemia due to enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus bovis, and streptococcus sanguis were immunoblotted against antigenic extracts from all four species. in e faecalis endocarditis there was a strong igm response to e faecalis antigenic bands of 112, 88-90, and 45-47 kd and a strong igg response to 88-90 and 45-47 kd bands. in e faecium endocarditis there was a pronounced igg response to an e faecium band of 82-90 kd. for s bovis endocarditis, there was a strong igg response to several components of s bovis including bands of 66, 58, 52 and 4 kd. for s sanguis, there was a strong igg response to bands of 80-82, 76, 60 and 45 kd. these patterns of antibody production were absent in patients with uncomplicated septicaemia and in controls. the delineation of these patterns enabled confirmation of the final diagnosis in seven patients initially suspected of having culture negative endocarditis.

AB  == twenty-one reference strains and 88 clinical isolates of aerococcus, enterococcus, and streptococcus species were tested for reactions in the rapid strep (rs) and modified conventional tests. we conclude that some but not all of  the tests in the rs system could be used to substitute for conventional tests. rs tests for hydrolysis of arginine, esculin, l-pyrrolidonyl-naphthylamide, production of acetyl methyl carbinol (voges-proskauer), and fermentation of arabinose, lactose, mannitol, raffinose, and sorbitol were satisfactory substitutes for conventional tests. however, the rs tests for hydrolysis of hippurate and starch and fermentation of inulin were not satisfactory substitutes for conventional tests. we also conclude that, of the five test tube voges-proskauer tests, the coblentz modification is the most discriminatory.

TI  == location of antibiotic resistance markers in clinical isolates of enterococcus faecalis with similar antibiotypes.
AB  == eight wild-type strains of enterococcus faecalis, resistant to chloramphenicol (cmr), erythromycin (emr), tetracycline (tcr), and minocycline (mnr), were examined for the genetic basis of their antibiotic resistance, five of the strains transferred all of their antibiotic resistance markers by conjugation, while the other three strains transferred only tcr and mnr. cmr and emr determinants were localized by dna-dna hybridization experiments, in which the cmr gene of plasmid pip501, of group b streptococcus origin, and the emr gene of  transposon tn917, of e. faecalis origin, served as probes. a chromosomal location was found for the nonconjugative cmr and emr markers of one wild-type strain. in  two strains these markers were carried by nonconjugative plasmids, and in the other strains they were carried by plasmids that transferred by conjugation. plasmids isolated from three transconjugants resistant to tetracycline but susceptible to minocycline bore nucleotide sequences homologous to the tetl gene. nucleotide sequences homologous to conjugative transposon tn916, of e. faecalis origin, were detected by hybridization in the tetracycline-minocycline-resistant  transconjugants. three of these transconjugants were plasmid free, while four harbored conjugative cryptic plasmids. sequences homologous to tn916 were also found on two conjugative plasmids, one of which appeared to be a conjugative cryptic plasmid that had acquired chromosomal tcr mnr markers during transfer.

TI  == lowering of cytoplasmic ph is essential for growth of streptococcus faecalis at high ph.
AB  == the growth of streptococcus faecalis at high ph was significantly stimulated by carbonate. in the absence of added carbonate the cells were unable to grow at a ph above 9.5, but in media containing 50 mm hco3- they grew even at ph 10.5. both rate and yield of growth at ph 9.5 were significantly stimulated by as little as  5 mm carbonate. the cytoplasmic ph in growing cells was maintained at about 7.8 to 8.2, whereas the medium ph ranged from 8.4 to 9.5. nigericin and gramicidin d, ionophores which conduct protons, blocked growth at ph 9.5 but not at ph 7.5. these results indicate that lowering of the cytoplasmic ph is essential for the growth of this organism at high ph.

TI  == sodium/proton antiporter in streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == streptococcus faecalis, like other bacteria, accumulates potassium ions and expels sodium ions. this paper is concerned with the pathway of sodium extrusion. earlier studies (d.l. heefner and f.m. harold, proc. natl. acad. sci. usa 79:2798-2802, 1982) showed that sodium extrusion is effected by a primary, atp-linked sodium pump. i report here that cells grown under conditions in which  sodium atpase is not induced can still expel sodium ions. this finding suggested  the existence of an alternate pathway. sodium extrusion by the alternate pathway  requires the cells to generate a proton motive force. this conclusion rests on the following observations. (i) sodium extrusion required glucose. (ii) sodium extrusion was observed at neutral ph, which allows the cells to generate a proton motive force, but not at alkaline ph, which reduces the proton motive force to zero. (iii) sodium extrusion was inhibited by the addition of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and of proton-conducting ionophores. (iv) in response to an artificial ph gradient (with the exterior acid), energy-depleted cells exhibited a transient sodium extrusion which was unaffected by treatments that dissipated the membrane potential and which was blocked by proton conductors. i propose that streptococci have two independent systems for sodium extrusion: an inducible sodium atpase and a constitutive sodium/proton antiporter.

TI  == [ability to survive and interactions of selected bacterial species in activated carbon filters].
AB  == the survival and the interactions of selected, hygienically relevant bacterial species in activated carbon filters was investigated. the numbers of escherichia  coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and p. putida increased in previously sterilized filters. after inoculation all bacteria (10(6] were adsorbed. during a period of  6-10 days the filter effluent contained no detectable bacteria. after that the colony numbers increased to a constant level of 10(4)-10(5) colony forming units  (cfu)/ml effluent and 10(6)-10(7) cfu/g activated carbon. klebsiella pneumoniae and streptococcus faecalis died off in the filter system. if the filters were inoculated simultaneously with two species, p. putida and p. aeruginosa remained  at a constant level between 10(4) and 10(5) cfu/ml. e. coli was suppressed by p.  aeruginosa and died off in the presence of p. putida. as in-vitro tests indicated, p. putida did not produce inhibitory substances against p. aeruginosa  or e. coli. on the other hand, p. aeruginosa showed antagonistic activities against e. coli.

TI  == high incidence of hemolysin production by enterococcus (streptococcus) faecalis strains associated with human parenteral infections.
AB  == hemolysin production, clumping (pheromone) response, transferability of the hemolytic trait, and drug resistance were examined in 97 clinical isolates of enterococcus (streptococcus) faecalis. the isolates were derived from various sources (i.e., urine, pus, vagina, sputum, bile, and blood), and approximately 60% were found to be hemolytic. about 85% of the hemolytic strains exhibited a clumping response, compared with about 49% of the nonhemolytic strains. over 50%  of the hemolytic strains carried transferable hemolysin determinants, and in no case were drug resistance genes linked. the hemolytic strains exhibited multiple  drug resistance more frequently than did the nonhemolytic strains. in contrast to the high frequency of hemolysin producers among parenteral isolates, strains derived from fecal specimens of healthy individuals exhibited a low (17%) incidence of hemolysin production.

TI  == comparison of single and multiple doses of prophylactic antibiotics in experimental streptococcal endocarditis.
AB  == single-doses or short-term administration of beta-lactam antibiotics alone or combined with aminoglucoside antibiotics have failed to consistently prevent experimental streptococcal endocarditis induced by high inocula of bacteria poorly susceptible to killing by these antibiotics. the optimal duration of administration of antibiotics for successful prophylaxis under these circumstances has not been established. we therefore tested, in rats with catheter-induced sterile aortic vegetations, the duration of administration of antibiotic necessary to prevent endocarditis induced by bacterial inocula 100 to  10,000 times the 90% infective dose of two tolerant viridans-group streptococci and two streptococcus faecalis strains. multiple-dose regimens of amoxicillin alone or of amoxicillin combined with gentamicin were studied. against the two viridans group streptococci, successful prophylaxis was achieved with multiple doses of amoxicillin alone given over 24 to 48 hr and by the combination of amoxicillin and gentamicin given for 6 to 24 hr. against the two s. faecalis strains, multiple-dose regimens with amoxicillin alone failed, but the combination of amoxicillin and gentamicin was successful when administered for 48 to 72 hr. thus, after challenge with high bacterial inocula, repeated doses of a  beta-lactam antibiotic alone were sufficient to prevent viridans streptococcal endocarditis, but multiple doses of a bactericidal combination (beta-lactam plus  aminoglucoside), as necessary for the treatment of established endocarditis, were a prerequisite for successful prophylaxis of s. faecalis endocarditis.

TI  == transfer functions of the streptococcus faecalis plasmid pad1: organization of plasmid dna encoding response to sex pheromone.
AB  == the conjugative plasmid pad1 (59.6 kilobases) of streptococcus faecalis shows a 10,000-fold increase in transfer frequency following induction by the sex pheromone cad1. mutagenesis of the plasmid with transposon tn917 was undertaken to determine the region(s) of pad1 required for the mating response. the relevant genetic material was found to be distributed over a 31.2-kilobase contiguous region of the plasmid. although insertions in two previously identified regions (traa and trab) exhibited increased transfer frequencies, insertions in five new  regions (d, e, f, g, and h) decreased the ability of pad1 to transfer. insertions in region h allowed the cells to form visible mating aggregates, but the plasmid  transfer frequency was decreased to levels below detection during a 1-h broth mating. mutants with mutations in region g were able to form aggregates; however, insertions in regions d, e, and f prevented aggregate formation. insertions in region c decreased the sensitivity of the cell to exogenous cad1 and exhibited increased activity of the pheromone inhibitor iad1. surface protein profiles produced by a number of these mutants were examined, and in some cases were found to be different from those of the wild type. a map showing the various regions is presented, and related aspects of the regulation of the pad1 mating response are  discussed.

AB  == in several tetracycline-resistant (tetr) clostridium difficile strains, homology  with the tn916 part of plasmid pam120 dna was observed. this 15-kilobase transposon, carrying a tetr determinant, was originally found in streptococcus (enterococcus) faecalis. hybridization experiments revealed that at least six of  seven hincii fragments of tn916, representing greater than 95% of its length, showed homology with dna of tetr c. difficile strains. therefore, a close relationship of the c. difficile tetr-determining element with the entire tn916 transposon can be assumed, although differences were observed concerning the number of hindiii cleavage sites within the transposon. in addition to strong hybridization of tetr determinants of c. difficile with tn916, weak signals were  detected when dna of tets c. difficile was hybridized with tn916. these weak signals could be attributed to a single internal hincii fragment of tn916.

AB  == closed-space neutropenic infection sites were simulated in rabbits by subcutaneous semipermeable chambers that were inoculated with 5 x 10(4) cfu/ml of various strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, and streptococcus avium. four hours after inoculation, treatment was begun with ciprofloxacin, 10 or 30 mg/kg, azlocillin, 100 mg/kg, amikacin, 15 mg/kg, procaine penicillin g, 300 u/dose, or gentamicin, 2 mg/kg, alone and in two-drug  combinations. antimicrobials were given intramuscularly every 6 hr for 16 doses.  extravascular chambers were sampled throughout the treatment course for bacterial counts and antimicrobial concentration. in vivo results were compared to in vitro tests of inhibition, killing, and synergism. ciprofloxacin alone had little effect on the animal infection sites. azlocillin alone reduced, in vivo, eight of 12 isolates greater than or equal to 5 log10 cfu/ml by 92 hr as compared to control. azlocillin plus ciprofloxacin reduced all 12 isolates greater than or equal to 5 log10 cfu/ml by 92 hr, whereas amikacin plus azlocillin reduced only three and penicillin plus gentamicin only one of the six group d streptococcal isolates greater than or equal to 5 log10 cfu/ml.

TI  == comparative survival of antibiotic-resistant and -sensitive fecal indicator bacteria in estuarine water.
AB  == the survival of antibiotic-resistant and -sensitive strains of escherichia coli,  enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus equinus, and two environmental isolates, ap17 and aq62, was examined in estuarine water. each strain was rendered resistant to a combination of two antibiotics by serial passage in increasing concentrations of antibiotics. cultures were incubated in filter-sterilized estuarine water for up to 7 days. recovery was assessed by examining colony-forming ability on media with and without antibiotics. none of the antibiotic-resistant forms survived longer than its antibiotic-sensitive counterpart in estuarine water. three of the resistant strains died off more rapidly than the antibiotic-sensitive wild type. survival of the test bacteria in estuarine water was as follows: sensitive and resistant aq62, resistant escherichia coli less than sensitive escherichia coli less than resistant ap17 less than resistant enterococcus faecium less than sensitive ap17, sensitive and  resistant s. equinus less than sensitive and resistant enterococcus faecalis, sensitive enterococcus faecium. the results supported the suggestion that fecal entercocci may serve as better indicators of fecal pollution than escherichia coli in marine ecosystems. moreover, the results indicated that the use of antibiotic-resistant mutants to follow the fate of bacteria in the environment is inappropriate without adequate studies to ensure that resistant and wild-type strains react similarly to environmental stressors.

TI  == beta-lactamase production in experimental endocarditis due to aminoglycoside-resistant streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == we used a beta-lactamase-producing (beta l+) strain of streptococcus faecalis that also had high levels of resistance to all aminoglycosides to induce experimental endocarditis in rats. the rats were treated for five or 10 days with procaine penicillin, vancomycin, gentamicin, rifampin, or ciprofloxacin (alone or in various combinations), or with penicillin plus clavulanic acid. the levels of  penicillin in serum and vegetations declined rapidly in the beta l+-infected rats treated with procaine penicillin alone, unlike the sustained levels of penicillin in either beta l- -infected rats treated with procaine penicillin or beta l+-infected rats treated with penicillin plus clavulanic acid. for the beta l+-infected rats, the enterococcal counts in vegetations were significantly reduced (greater than 3 log10 cfu/g) only by vancomycin and by penicillin plus clavulanic acid. the efficacy of the latter regimen probably resulted from the inhibition of penicillin inactivation by clavulanic acid in vegetations infected  with the beta l+ strain. our in vivo findings document the biologic significance  of beta-lactamase production.

TI  == two conjugation systems associated with streptococcus faecalis plasmid pcf10: identification of a conjugative transposon that transfers between s. faecalis and bacillus subtilis.
AB  == the tetracycline resistance plasmid pcf10 (58 kilobases [kb]) of streptococcus faecalis possesses two separate conjugation systems. a 25-kb region of the plasmid (designated tra) was shown previously to determine pheromone response and conjugation functions required for transfer of pcf10 between s. faecalis cells (p. j. christie and g. m. dunny, plasmid 15:230-241, 1986). when s. faecalis cells were mixed with bacillus subtilis in broth, tetracycline resistance was transferred from s. faecalis. the tetracycline-resistant b. subtilis cells contained a 16-kb region of pcf10 (distinct from tra) that carried the tetracycline resistance determinant (tetr). this tetr element was found to transfer between s. faecalis and b. subtilis strains in the absence of plasmids.  genetic and molecular techniques were used to establish locations of the element  at several different sites on the b. subtilis chromosome. the tetr element could  be transferred in filter matings from b. subtilis to s. faecalis strains and between recombination-proficient and -deficient s. faecalis strains in the absence of any plasmid dna. the transfer required direct cell-to-cell contact and was not inhibited by dnase. the tetr element was shown to transpose from the s. faecalis chromosome to various locations within the hemolysin plasmid pad1. together, the data indicate that the tetr element, termed transposon tn925, is very similar to the conjugative transposon tn916 in both structure and function.  a derivative of tn925, containing transposon tn917 inserted into a site approximately 3 kb from one end, exhibited elevated transfer frequencies and may  provide a useful means for delivering tn917 by conjugation into various gram-positive species.

TI  == cloning of the k+-atpase of streptococcus faecalis. structural and evolutionary implications of its homology to the kdpb-protein of escherichia coli.
AB  == the k+-atpase of streptococcus faecalis consists of a single polypeptide component of relative mr = 78,000 and serves as an atp-driven pump for the accumulation of potassium by the bacterial cell. the gene encoding this atpase was isolated by immunological screening of an s. faecalis genomic library in the  escherichia coli/puc8 host/vector system. two independently derived clones express the full-size atpase polypeptide. transcription and translation of the cloned dna apparently proceed by means of the respective s. faecalis signals. dna sequencing revealed a gene encoding a protein of 583 amino acids and a calculated mr of 63,070. this protein exhibits in its primary structure regions of homology  with the kdpb-subunit of the k+-atpase of e. coli and, to a lesser extent, with eukaryotic ion-motive atpases. the hydropathy profiles and secondary structure predictions, respectively, for the s. faecalis atpase and the e. coli kdpb-protein show striking similarity. even regions with low homology in the amino acid sequence exhibit structural features that have clearly been conserved  in the two proteins. this points to a fundamental role of these domains in the structure and/or function of these transport atpases.

AB  == enterococcal isolates from young chickens were differentiated into one of three species, namely enterococcus faecalis, ent. faecium and ent. gallinarum. the proportion of each species among the enterococcal population changed with time in birds not dosed with antibiotics. this pattern of change was modified in birds dosed with either tylosin or ampicillin even though ampicillin did not select for ampicillin resistance among the enterococcal population. a gradual increase in tylosin resistance was recorded with time among the enterococci of the 'undosed'  control birds. this was associated with an increase in the proportion of ent. faecium, a species commonly resistant to tylosin, among the enterococci of the birds as they grew older.

TI  == nucleotide sequence of the kanamycin resistance determinant of the pneumococcal transposon tn1545: evolutionary relationships and transcriptional analysis of apha-3 genes.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the kanamycin resistance determinant apha-3 encoded by transposon tn1545 from streptococcus pneumoniae was determined and compared to those of plasmids pjh1 and pip1433 from streptococcus faecalis and campylobacter  coli, respectively. the three sequences were found to be identical and differed by two substitutions and the deletion of a codon from that of plasmid psh2 from staphylococcus aureus. comparison of the 5' noncoding sequences indicated that the regions containing the apha-3 gene in pjh1 and in tn1545 evolved independently by deletion from a sequence similar to that found in pip1433. in the latter plasmid, apha-3 is transcribed from a promoter, p1, which is flanked by two 12-base pair direct repeats. the rearrangement observed in pjh1 removed one of these recombinogenic sites and altered the -10 and 3' flanking sequences of p1. the promoter thus generated. p1', allows expression of similar level of kanamycin resistance as p1. however, fusion experiments carried out with a promotorless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene indicated that the canonical  promoter p1 is significantly less efficient than p1'. from analysis of the thermodynamic properties of these promoters, we conclude that this difference in  strength reflects the melting properties of the -10 sequences. the transition from pip1433 to pjh1 may correspond to the progression of a molecule structurally unstable to a more stable one combined with the need to maintain an efficient promoter upstream of the apha-3 gene. the deletion event in tn1545, which occurred between the two 12-base pair directly repeated sequences, removed p1 in  its entirety.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == effect of histological decalcifying agents on number and stainability of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == in tests of the effects of restorative materials on dental pulp, it is important  that one evaluate bacterial contamination, and this is usually done histologically. preceding the usual paraffin-embedding of hard-tissue specimens for microscopical investigations, decalcification is performed. to study the influence of decalcifying agents (nitric acid, formic acid, and ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid) on the number and gram-stainability of bacteria, we used a model system consisting of suspensions of formaldehyde-fixed streptococcus faecalis. the gram-positive organisms were stored in distilled water, in 4% formaldehyde solution, or in the decalcifying agents for various experimental periods. counts were made by means of a hemocytometer, and smears were stained with the brown and brenn staining method. after periods which are averages for the decalcification of teeth, severe reductions of both the number and the gram-positive stainability were found. after one week in formic acid, only one out of 15 organisms stained blue. with nitric acid and edta, the reductions were  fewer. since only blue-staining bacteria can be detected clearly in tissue sections, the results of these experiments indicate that, with limited numbers of organisms, the risk exists for false-negative scores for decalcified hard-tissue  sections.

TI  == kinetics of activation of l-lactate dehydrogenase from streptococcus faecalis by  fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and by metal ions.
AB  == the lactate dehydrogenase from streptococcus faecalis is activated either by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate or by divalent cations such as mn2+ or co2+. with both  types of activator, a lag is observed before attainment of the steady state rate  of pyruvate reduction if the activator is added to the enzyme at the same time as the substrates. this lag can be largely abolished by preincubation of enzyme with activator before mixing with substrates. for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (fru(1,6)p2) as the activator, the rate constant for the lag phase showed a linear dependence on activator concentration but was independent of enzyme concentration. this suggests that binding of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate induces a  conformational change in the enzyme which leads to increased activity, without association of enzyme subunits or dimers. with co2+ as activator, the rate constant for the lag phase showed a hyperbolic dependence on co2+ concentration and was also dependent on enzyme concentration. this suggests that activation by  co2+, in contrast to that by fru(1,6)p2, involves association of enzyme dimers, followed by ligand binding.

AB  == penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) of streptococcus faecalis nctc 775, s. faecium nctc 7171 and an isolate of s. faecium (strain 37) highly resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics were visualised by autoradiography. five pbps were detected in s. faecalis nctc 775 and six in s. faecium nctc 7171. additional pbps could not be found in the resistant isolate of s. faecium. the pbp affinities of  beta lactams were compared with mic values. the affinities of pbps 3 and 4 of s.  faecalis nctc 775 for penicillin g, ampicillin, cefathiamidine, cephaloridine and cephazolin were related to the sensitivity of the strain to these antibiotics as  were the affinities of pbps 4 and 5 in each s. faecium strain for the beta lactams. it is postulated that pbps 3 and 4 of s. faecalis nctc 775 and pbps 4 and 5 of s. faecium are the relevant target enzymes of the test antibiotics. pbps 4 and 5 of the highly beta-lactam-resistant s. faecium strain 37 showed proportionally low affinities for the five beta lactams compared to that of the less resistant strain s. faecium nctc 7171. decreased affinities of pbps 4 and 5  may account for the resistance in s. faecium strain 37 to beta lactams. the affinities for pbp 1, 2 and 5 in s. faecalis nctc 775 and pbps 1, 2, 3 and 6 in s. faecium were not related to the antibiotic sensitivities.

TI  == tn916-induced mutations in the hemolysin determinant affecting virulence of listeria monocytogenes.
AB  == a genetic determinant essential for hemolysin production by listeria monocytogenes has been inactivated by insertion of transposon tn916 into l. monocytogenes dna. the transposon was transferred by means of conjugation of a streptomycin-resistant l. monocytogenes recipient strain with streptococcus faecalis cg110 on membrane filters. among the tetracycline-resistant transconjugants, mutants were detected which had lost hemolytic activity. when tested in a mouse model, these mutants appeared to have lost the virulence that characterizes the parental strain. an extracellular protein of 58,000 apparent molecular weight was eliminated in the nonhemolytic mutants. in some of the mutants, the decrease in the production of the 58,000-dalton protein was accompanied by the production of a new protein of 49,000 apparent molecular weight. hemolytic revertants regained the hemolytic phenotype and virulence and produced the extracellular protein that characterizes the recipient strain. hybridization studies with tn916 dna indicated that the transposon is present in  ecori and hindiii fragments of the nonhemolytic mutants. single copies of tn916 were detected in the chromosomal dna of two of the three nonhemolytic mutants that were studied in detail. in hemolytic, tetracycline-sensitive revertants tn916 appeared to be completely excised from the chromosome.

AB  == intermittent administration of ampicillin alone has resulted in high failure rates in previously described animal models of enterococcal endocarditis. we developed a rat model of enterococcal endocarditis which permits comparison of continuous intravenous infusion of ampicillin with intramuscular therapy. continuous low-dose ampicillin infusion (450 mg/kg [body weight] per day) was compared with the same dose given intramuscularly in three divided doses and with high-dose infusion (4.5 g/kg per day) of the drug. for the infecting strain of streptococcus faecalis, the mic and mbc were 1 microgram/ml. mean ampicillin levels in serum were 53.9 +/- 4.8 (peak) and less than 1 (trough), 8.7 +/- 1.4, and 244 +/- 29 micrograms/ml for intramuscular, low-dose, and high-dose regimens, respectively. ampicillin infusion therapy significantly increased the survival rate and sterilization of blood cultures. continuous infusions were superior to intermittent therapy in eradicating bacteremia. after 5 days of treatment, low-dose ampicillin infusion was more effective than intermittent therapy in sterilizing cardiac vegetations (p less than 0.01). continuous-infusion therapy at either dose was significantly more effective than intramuscular injection in reducing bacterial titers in cardiac vegetations (5.4 +/- 1.0 log10 cfu/g [low dose], 4.8 +/- 0.3 log10 cfu/g [high dose], and 7.7 +/- 0.3 log10 cfu/g [intramuscular]). however, no statistically significant advantage was found for high-dose compared with low-dose ampicillin infusion in lowering bacterial titers in vegetations (p greater than 0.3).

TI  == enterococci and aminoglycosides: evaluation of susceptibility and synergism of their combination with piperacillin.
AB  == some clinical isolates of enterococci were tested for susceptibility to gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin and netilmicin. five percent of streptococcus faecalis tested demonstrated high level resistance (minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) greater than 2024 micrograms/ml) to gentamicin, tobramycin and netilmicin, while amikacin had mics greater than 128 micrograms/ml for all strains tested. since a combination of a beta-lactam and streptomycin does not produce synergism against all strains of enterococci for an increase in the number of highly resistant strains, the effect of piperacillin plus gentamicin, tobramycin, and netilmicin was examined. the combination piperacillin + netilmicin seemed to be very effective against all enterococci tested.

TI  == biotyping, serotyping and phage typing of streptococcus faecalis isolated from dental plaque in the human mouth.
AB  == thirty streptococcus faecalis isolates from mixed dental plaque samples were classified into four groups on the basis of biotype, tetracycline susceptibility, phage type and serotype combinations. the organisms were from patients on haemodialysis, from staff of the dialysis unit, and from controls. three biotypes were distinguished by seven biochemical tests: production of acid from inositol,  sucrose and xylose; rapid or delayed production of acid from sorbitol; gelatin liquefaction; and production of alkaline phosphatase and beta-galactosidase. with a set of eight typing antisera for s. faecalis, 15 strains were non-typable, 12 were serotype 1 and three were serotype 19. with a set of 17 bacteriophages specific for s. faecalis, all of the oral isolates were typable; 40% were lysotype i1 and the remainder lysotype v6b. on the basis of biotype-serotype-phage-type combinations, indications of possible spread of strains between haemodialysis patients and dialysis unit staff were obtained. biotyping and serotyping of 13 german isolates of s. faecalis of phage type i1 from four clinical sources and tripartite typing of three control strains provided additional evidence for the potential of biotyping in distinguishing between strains of identical serotype and phage type. one oral isolate of s. faecium was of phage type xx. none of the oral isolates of s. faecalis, of which  14 exhibited delayed sorbitol fermentation, reacted with group-g streptococcal grouping reagents or antiserum. slow sorbitol fermentation does not appear to be  a definitive phenotypic marker for s. faecalis strains possessing antigens that react with both group-d and group-g grouping reagents.

TI  == serodiagnosis of streptococcus faecalis endocarditis by immunoblotting of surface protein antigens.
AB  == we describe a method for the serodiagnosis of streptococcus faecalis in infective endocarditis which could be of value in culture-negative cases. serum-grown cells of s. faecalis produced three major characteristic protein antigens (73,000, 40,000, and 37,000 molecular weight) which were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of solubilized whole cells. after electrophoretic transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane, these antigens were visualized by probing with serum from patients with endocarditis caused by s. faecalis. serum from patients with endocarditis caused by other organisms did not react with the s. faecalis-specific antigens. this procedure should facilitate positive early diagnosis of s. faecalis endocarditis or establish its absence in  culture-negative cases.

AB  == the in vitro activity of the new lipopeptide antibiotic ly146032 was generally four-fold greater (mic 90 less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml) than that of vancomycin against methicillin-susceptible or methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative species of staphylococcus. enterococci, streptococcus bovis, group b and viridans streptococci, and corynebacterium group j-k isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml of ly146032, which represented activity equivalent to or greater than that of vancomycin. unlike vancomycin, ly146032 was bactericidal for enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and listeria monocytogenes. due to its bactericidal properties ly146032 appeared to represent an improvement over vancomycin and teicoplanin.

TI  == carriage rates of enterococci in the dental plaque of haemodialysis patients in dublin.
AB  == the incidence of carriage of enterococci in dental plaque was determined in haemodialysis patients attending three clinics in the dublin area either as outpatients or as hospitalised patients. their carriage rates were compared with  a university group comprising normal healthy students, academic staff, technicians and ancillary personnel and with a cohort of otherwise healthy toothache patients. the carriage rates among the staffs of the dialysis units also were examined. the overall carriage rates of enterococci of the university group, the toothache patient group, the haemodialysis patients and the dialysis unit staffs did not differ significantly from each other, ranging from 5%-20%. however, the dental plaque of a mainly hospitalised group of haemodialysis patients and their attendant staff at one clinic was colonised to a statistically significant higher degree with enterococci than that of the haemodialysis patients and the staff at the outpatient clinics, both separately and as combined patient and staff groups. age, sex, a history of recent antibiotic therapy, and elapsed time since the last dental visit did not affect isolation rates to a significant extent. the commonest enterococcus isolated from subjects was streptococcus faecalis, followed by its variety liquefaciens. only one subject harboured streptococcus durans in dental plaque. ten of the 21 subjects yielding  enterococci harboured two different enterococci in their plaque. the isolation of s. faecalis var liquefaciens alone or in combination with s. faecalis did not correlate with subject-history parameters. the findings obtained imply that antibiotic prophylaxis specifically against enterococci may be necessary only for a small number of haemodialysis patients in whom oral carriage of enterococci has been demonstrated bacteriologically.

TI  == arginine modification with butanedione inhibits the potassium atpase of streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == the k+-atpase of streptococcus faecalis is inhibited by incubation with the arginine-modifying reagent 2,3-butanedione. the inactivation proceeds by pseudo - first order kinetics and a double-logarithmic plot of the pseudo - first order rate constants versus reagent concentrations yields a reaction order of 1.14 with respect to butanedione. partially inactivated atpase exhibits a decreased maximal velocity but the same affinity for atp, as compared to the native enzyme. butanedione modification is inhibited by adenine nucleotides. these results indicate the involvement of most likely one crucial arginyl residue in adenine nucleotide binding by the atpase.

TI  == reconstitution of atp-dependent calcium transport from streptococci.
AB  == membrane vesicles of three streptococcal strains (streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus lactis, and streptococcus sanguis) were extracted with octyl-beta-d-glucoside in the presence of escherichia coli lipid and glycerol. for reconstitution, the detergent extract was mixed with bath-sonicated e. coli lipid, in the presence of octyl-beta-d-glucoside, and proteoliposomes were formed by a 25-fold dilution. atp-dependent calcium accumulation by proteoliposomes was  comparable to that found in parent vesicles. recovery of this calcium transport activity was dependent on the inclusion of an osmolyte protein stabilant (glycerol, etc.) during solubilization. the properties of atp-driven calcium transport were studied in the reconstituted system. in proteoliposomes, atp-linked calcium accumulation was not affected by the protonophore, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, or by the ionophores, valinomycin and  nigericin, in the presence of potassium, or by n,n'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, an  inhibitor of the f0f1-atpase. on the other hand, calcium transport was completely blocked by micromolar levels of orthovanadate; half-maximal inhibitions were observed at 0.4, 4, and 4 microm vanadate, for s. faecalis, s. lactis, and s. sanguis, respectively. this marked sensitivity to orthovanadate suggests operation of an e1e2-type ion-motive pump. these data demonstrate that, in a reconstituted system, calcium transport is not linked to an atp-dependent proton  circulation via the f0f1-atpase, but rather is driven by a calcium-translocating  atpase. thus, calcium extrusion from the cytosol of enteric, lactic acid, or oral streptococci is mediated by an atp-linked process analogous to the ion-motive atpases of eukaryotic membranes.

AB  == the flavin-containing nadh peroxidase of streptococcus faecalis 10c1, which catalyzes the reaction: nadh + h+ + h2o2----nad+ + 2h2o, has been purified to homogeneity in our laboratory for analyses of both its structure and redox behavior. our findings indicate that the enzyme is a tetramer of four apparently  identical subunits (mr = 46,000/subunit), each containing one fad coenzyme and a  second non-flavin, nonmetal redox center. there is no evidence of nonequivalence  among the flavins. dithionite reduction of the enzyme occurs in two steps, with end points of 0.96 and 2.05 eq/fad. the first step generates a two-electron reduced form of the enzyme (eh2) which is spectrally identical with that generated by aerobic addition of nadh. our studies suggest that the long-wavelength absorbance band (lambda max approximately 540 nm) exhibited by this form results from charge-transfer interaction between the reduced non-flavin redox center and the oxidized flavin. a second type of long-wavelength charge-transfer absorbance band (lambda max approximately 770 nm) is generated on anaerobic addition of 1 eq of nadh to eh2 and results from interaction between oxidized fad and the reduced pyridine nucleotide. either the eh2 x nad+ or the eh2 x nad+ x nadh forms may be involved in the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme, as both are reactive with hydrogen peroxide.

TI  == dispersal of a plasmid-borne chloramphenicol resistance gene in streptococcal and enterococcal plasmids.
AB  == plasmids coding for chloramphenicol resistance, five isolated from streptococci of groups a, b, and g, ten from enterococci (enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus  faecium), and two from staphylococci, were tested for sequence homology with the  chloramphenicol resistance gene of pip501, a 30-kb plasmid originally isolated from a group b streptococcus. the 6.3-kb hindiii fragment of pip501, known to carry the chloramphenicol resistance gene, was cloned into pbr322. a 1.6-kb portion of the cloned fragment, which included most of the chloramphenicol resistance gene, was used as probe in dna-dna hybridization experiments. sequence homology was detected between the probe and four of the streptococcal, seven of the enterococcal, and one of the staphylococcal plasmids. the absence of hybridization between this probe and one plasmid isolated from a group b streptococcus, as well as three isolated from e. faecalis, indicated that there are at least two different plasmid-borne chloramphenicol resistance determinants  in the streptococci and in the enterococci.

TI  == streptococcal phosphoenolpyruvate-sugar phosphotransferase system: amino acid sequence and site of atp-dependent phosphorylation of hpr.
AB  == the amino acid sequence of histidine-containing protein (hpr) from streptococcus  faecalis has been determined by direct edman degradation of intact hpr and by amino acid sequence analysis of tryptic peptides, v8 proteolytic peptides, thermolytic peptides, and cyanogen bromide cleavage products. hpr from s. faecalis was found to contain 89 amino acid residues, corresponding to a molecular weight of 9438. the amino acid sequence of hpr from s. faecalis shows extended homology to the primary structure of hpr proteins from other bacteria. besides the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation of a histidyl residue in hpr, catalyzed by enzyme i of the bacterial phosphotransferase system, hpr was also found to be phosphorylated at a seryl residue in an atp-dependent protein kinase catalyzed reaction [deutscher, j., & saier, m. h., jr. (1983) proc. natl.  acad. sci. u.s.a. 80, 6790-6794]. the site of atp-dependent phosphorylation in hpr of s. faecalis has now been determined. [32p]p-ser-hpr was digested with three different proteases, and in each case, a single labeled peptide was isolated. following digestion with subtilisin, we obtained a peptide with the sequence -(p)ser-ile-met-. using chymotrypsin, we isolated a peptide with the sequence -ser-val-asn-leu-lys-(p)ser-ile-met-gly-val-met-. the longest labeled peptide was obtained with v8 staphylococcal protease. according to amino acid analysis, this peptide contained 36 out of the 89 amino acid residues of hpr. the following sequence of 12 amino acid residues of the v8 peptide was determined: -tyr-lys-gly-lys-ser-val-asn-leu-lys-(p)ser-ile-met-.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == characterization and partial purification of a broad spectrum antibiotic as-48 produced by streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == streptococcus faecalis s-48 produces a broad spectrum antibiotic, active against  gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. this substance is produced in solid and liquid media and also in a defined basal medium. it is sensitive to protease, pronase, or trypsin, heating at 70 degrees c, and alkaline ph, but resistant to treatment with lipase, lysozyme, alkaline phosphatase, dnaase, rnaase, acidic or  neutral phs, and also lower temperatures (60 degrees c). several organic solvents cause precipitation, but not inactivation. this antibiotic has been partially purified by gel filtration and further ion-exchange chromatography. its molecular weight has been estimated close to 2000. the biological activity of this antagonistic substance against the selected indicator strains, streptococcus faecalis s-47 and escherichia coli u-9, is bactericidal. the characterization of  this substance, initially classified as a bacteriocin, indicates that it is an antibiotic of peptidic nature. the significance of antibiotic occurrence in group d of the genus streptococcus is also discussed.

TI  == bactericidal activity of netilmicin compared with gentamicin and streptomycin, alone and in combination with penicillin, against penicillin tolerant viridans streptococci and enterococci.
AB  == netilmicin was compared with gentamicin and streptomycin for in-vitro activity against 30 strains of penicillin-tolerant streptococci including 16 strains of enterococci. both netilmicin and gentamicin tested alone at 4 mg/l caused 99.9% kill of more than half of the 13 strains of viridans streptococci tested, whereas streptomycin, 4 mg/l, had no bactericidal effect against these strains. netilmicin, gentamicin and streptomycin tested alone at 8.0 mg/l against 10 strains of streptococcus faecalis resulted in 99.9% kill of six, one and zero strains respectively. combinations of penicillin with 2 mg/l of either netilmicin or gentamicin resulted in bactericidal synergy against 12 of 13 strains of viridans streptococci and all 10 strains of s. faecalis after 18 to 24 h incubation. parallel experiments showed that higher concentration of penicillin were required to obtain 99.9% kill of 10 streptococcal strains when 4 mg/l streptomycin was compared with 2 mg/l of the other aminoglycosides. killing curves showed similar bactericidal synergy for netilmicin-penicillin and gentamicin-penicillin combinations against most streptococci tested after 24 h incubation but there was sometimes a greater bactericidal effect noted with netilmicin after only 6 h incubation of the broth or after 48 h incubation. the results of this in-vitro study suggest that netilmicin is at least as effective as gentamicin as a bactericidal synergic agent with penicillin against penicillin-tolerant viridans streptococci and s. faecalis strains isolated from patients with endocarditis. neither gentamicin or netilmicin were effective as bactericidal synergic agents with penicillin against 4 of 6 strains of s. faecium tested.

TI  == identification of pheromone-induced surface proteins in streptococcus faecalis and evidence of a role for lipoteichoic acid in formation of mating aggregates.
AB  == the conjugative transfer of the streptococcus faecalis plasmid pad1 is characterized by a 10,000-fold increase in frequency following sex pheromone (cad1) induction. before the increase in plasmid transfer, donor cells synthesize a proteinaceous adhesin that facilitates the formation of mating aggregates. four novel surface proteins appearing after exposure of pad1-containing cells to sex pheromone have been identified. thirty minutes after induction, a 130-kilodalton  (kda) protein was detectable by western blotting. a 74-kda protein, the major species present, and a pair of bands at 153 and 157 kda were evident 45 min after induction. induced cells containing another conjugative s. faecalis plasmid, ppd1, gave rise to three high-molecular-weight proteins of the same size (130, 153, and 157 kda) as those synthesized by pad1-containing cells. these proteins cross-reacted with antisera raised against induced cells containing pad1. however, the major protein species produced by ppd1-containing cells had a molecular weight of 78,000 and did not cross-react significantly with the corresponding band of the pad1 system. pheromone-induced transfer of the two plasmids, when both were present in the same cell, was independent; induction was limited to the pheromone-specified plasmid. the possibility that lipoteichoic acid might act as a receptor (binding substance) for the induced adhesin protein  was also explored. free lipoteichoic acid (isolated from s. faecalis) inhibited clumping of induced cells, apparently by acting as a competitive inhibitor of the cellular binding substance.

(ch3)2sncl2 and (ch3)3sncl decreased viable counts at about 10 to 100 mg of sn liter-1 (8.4 x 10(-5) to 8.4 x 10(-4) mol of sn liter-1), and tributyltin chloride was effective at about 0.1 to 1.0 mg of sn liter-1 (8.4 x 10(-7) to 8.4 x 10(-6) mol of sn liter-1. these concentrations, particularly for the methyltin compounds, are greater than the concentrations reported to date for these compounds in aquatic ecosystems. thus, organotin compounds alone would not be likely to cause reductions in counts of indicator organisms measured by standard methods. however, it is suggested that, when combined with other environmental stressors or upon long exposure, organotins such as butyltins may contribute to the injury  of indicator organisms.

TI  == sepsis and cholestasis: the in vitro effects of bacterial products on 14c-taurocholate uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.
AB  == bacterial endotoxins are known to be an important cause of cholestasis, yet not all organisms that cause cholestasis produce endotoxins. in order to determine whether bacterial products other than endotoxins may be involved in the cholestasis process, 14c-taurocholate (tc) uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes was measured in the presence of mid-log, stationary and mid-death phase bacterial broth supernatants from eight common bacterial pathogens. the results were then correlated with a quantitative assessment of endotoxin production by each organism. supernatants from haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumonia demonstrated a striking inhibitory effect on bile salt uptake (77.2 +/- 6.7, 46.9 +/- 6.5 and 32.9 +/- 7.1% maximum inhibition of 14c-tc uptake, respectively) when compared to sterile broth controls. streptococcus faecalis (enterococcus), escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and bacteroides  fragilis products, on the other hand, had relatively minor effects (12.3 +/- 5.2, 12.0 +/- 7.5, 8.4 +/- 6.7 and less than 5.0% inhibition respectively), while those from proteus mirabilis had an intermediate effect (18.5 +/- 8.3% inhibition). bile salt efflux rates (16.0 +/- 2.7 and 25.1 +/- 4.2 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, mean +/- sem) were similar in bacteria demonstrating marked uptake inhibition (haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa) when compared to those with only minor inhibitory effects (staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis) (14.3 +/- 1.1 and 18.4 +/- 2.6 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, respectively, p greater than 0.05). 14c-tc uptake inhibition did not correlate with the amount of endotoxin produced by each organism (r = 0.251). the results of this study indicate that bacteria produce a factor other than endotoxin that significantly inhibits bile salt uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the gene specifying the bifunctional 6'-aminoglycoside acetyltransferase [aac(6')] 2"-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase [aph(2")] enzyme from the streptococcus faecalis plasmid pip800 was cloned in escherichia coli. a single protein with an apparent molecular weight of 56,000 was specified by this cloned  determinant as detected in minicell experiments. nucleotide sequence analysis revealed the presence of an open reading frame capable of specifying a protein of 479 amino acids and with a molecular weight of 56,850. the deduced amino acid sequence of the bifunctional aac(6')-aph(2") gene product possessed two regions of homology with other sequenced resistance proteins. the n-terminal region contained a sequence that was homologous to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase of bacillus pumilus, and the c-terminal region contained a sequence homologous to the aminoglycoside phosphotransferase of streptomyces fradiae. subcloning experiments were performed with the aac(6')-aph(2") resistance determinant, and it was possible to obtain gene segments independently specifying the acetyltransferase and phosphotransferase activities. these data suggest that the  gene specifying the aac(6')-aph(2") resistance enzyme arose as a result of a gene fusion.

AB  == between november 1981 and october 1984, 48 of 3,458 clinical isolates of streptococcus faecalis at the university of michigan hospital showed high-level (greater than 2,000 micrograms/ml) resistance to gentamicin, as well as to all other clinically available aminoglycosides. thirteen percent of clinical isolates in the university of michigan hospital currently demonstrate this level of resistance. transfer of resistance to a plasmid-free streptococcal recipient was  observed in filter matings for 44 of 48 such isolates. analysis of transconjugants by agarose gel electrophoresis showed that gentamicin resistance  was transferred alone in 8 isolates and was combined with other antimicrobial resistances on the same plasmid in the other 36 isolates. there were seven isolates which transferred the property of horse blood beta-hemolysis along with  gentamicin resistance. transfer of gentamicin resistance was either by conjugative plasmids or by a nonconjugative but mobilizable plasmid. transfer frequencies on filters ranged from 4.7 x 10(-2) to 4.1 x 10(-8). based on donor and transconjugant antibiotic resistance markers, agarose gel electrophoresis, transfer properties, and restriction enzyme analysis, the plasmid content of transconjugants was heterogeneous and could be classified into at least seven different patterns. these findings argue against clonal dissemination as the cause of the increased frequency of resistant strains and suggest that resistance to gentamicin appears on a variety of physically distinct conjugative and nonconjugative plasmids in s. faecalis.

AB  == the purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of 20-hour pre-diffusion, i.e. placing the antibiotic-containing discs on the agar for 20 hours prior to inoculation, as compared to direct diffusion, i.e. placing the discs on the agar immediately after inoculation, for the newer 3. generation cephalosporins as represented by ceftazidime and ceftriaxone. regression lines (zone sizes vs. inhibitory concentrations, as measured by plate-dilution) were constructed for three groups of bacteria chosen because of their differences in growth characteristics on agar: e. coli (n = 50), enterobacter sp. (n = 35), and  streptococci (n = 51). the results for both cephalosporins were: 20-hour pre-diffusion produced larger zones than direct diffusion, regression studies for 20-hour pre-diffusion as compared to direct diffusion resulted in greater variation in zone sizes, numerically lower slopes, lower residual variances and higher correlation coefficients, and regression lines were significantly different for the 3 groups of bacteria with direct diffusion but not so with 20-hour pre-diffusion. considering the interpretation of zone sizes with disc diffusion for the cephalosporins tested, 20-hour pre-diffusion was superior to direct diffusion.

TI  == modulation of complement fixation and the phlogistic capacity of group a, b, and  d streptococci by human lysozyme acting on their cell walls.
AB  == streptococci and streptococcal cell wall fragments induce arthritis in rats, with the severity and duration depending on the capacity of the cells or cell fragments to resist degradation by tissue enzymes. their phlogogenic effects are  apparently related to their ability to activate the alternate complement pathway  (acp). the in vitro activation of the acp by lysozyme-treated cells and cell walls of group a, b, and d streptococci suggests that both rat and human lysozyme can modulate this activity, i.e., increasing it, decreasing it, or doing both in  that order. the effects of the lysozymes also correlated with the degree to which they can unmask the aminosugar-reducing groups detectable in a given amount of cell wall, which suggests that partial depolymerization of the cell wall is critical for acp activation. the effects of mutanolysin and c phage lysin on acp  activation were found to be correlated with their action on streptococcal cell walls. neuraminidase had relatively little effect on acp activation by most streptococcal strains tested. we conclude that the participation of tissue enzymes, including but not necessarily limited to lysozyme, is an important determinant for the clinical arthritis induced by group a, b, or d streptococci.  experimental arthritis induced in rats with whole (or disrupted) streptococci may depend both on the capacities of the cell walls to activate the acp and on the capacities of the host tissue enzymes to modulate this activation. great severity and long durations of the disease were determined by the capacity of the enzymes  to degrade cell wall antigens to a degree sufficient to ensure efficient activation of the acp without completely degrading the material so that it no longer activates complement. in this model, the limited resistance of group b peptidoglycan to lysozyme was a critical pathogenic factor.

TI  == high-level resistance to gentamicin in streptococcus faecalis: risk factors and evidence for exogenous acquisition of infection.
AB  == between november 1981 and october 1984, 48 of 3,456 clinical isolates of streptococcus faecalis that were studied showed high-level (greater than 2,000 micrograms/ml) resistance to gentamicin. a case-control study comparing patients  with gentamicin-susceptible (mic less than 64 micrograms/ml) and -resistant s. faecalis infections showed significant associations (p less than .01) between the development of infection with highly gentamicin-resistant s. faecalis and prior antimicrobial therapy (particularly with cephalosporins or aminoglycosides), perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis, prior surgical procedures, and longer hospitalization. all highly resistant strains appeared to be nosocomial since 12  cases were clustered on a surgical floor and in a burn unit. in vitro transfer of gentamicin resistance by filter mating was observed for 44 of 48 isolates. the use of plasmid content as an epidemiological marker suggested nosocomial transmission and exogenous acquisition of s. faecalis.

TI  == structure of a conjugative element in streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == we have cloned and mapped a 69-kilobase (kb) region of the chromosome of streptococcus pneumoniae dp1322, which carries the conjugative omega (cat-tet) insertion from s. pneumoniae bm6001. this element proved to be 65.5 kb in size. location of the junctions was facilitated by cloning a preferred target region from the wild-type strain rx1 recipient genome. this target site was preferred by both the bm6001 element and the cat-erm-tet element from streptococcus agalactiae b109. within the bm6001 element cat and tet were separated by 30 kb, and cat was  flanked by two copies of a sequence that was also present in the recipient strain rx1 dna. another sequence at least 2.4 kb in size was found inside the bm6001 element and at two places in the rx1 genome. its role is unknown. the ends of the bm6001 element appear to be the same as those of the b109 element, both as seen after transfer to s. pneumoniae and as mapped by others in pdp5 after transposition in streptococcus faecalis. we see no homology between the ends of the bm6001 element and find no evidence suggesting that it ever circularizes.

TI  == stimulation of dihydroxyacetone and glycerol kinase activity in streptococcus faecalis by phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation catalyzed by enzyme i and hpr of the phosphotransferase system.
AB  == recently we reported the phosphoenolpyruvate (pep)-dependent phosphorylation of a 55-kilodalton protein of streptococcus faecalis catalyzed by enzyme i and histidine-containing protein (hpr) of the phosphotransferase system (j. deutscher, fems microbiol. lett. 29:237-243, 1985). the purified 55-kilodalton protein was found to exhibit dihydroxyacetone kinase activity. glycerol was six times more slowly phosphorylated than dihydroxyacetone. the kms were found to be  0.7 mm for atp, 0.45 mm for dihydroxyacetone, and 0.9 mm for glycerol. pep-dependent phosphorylation of dihydroxyacetone kinase stimulated phosphorylation of both substrates about 10-fold. fructose 1,6-diphosphate at concentrations higher than 2 mm inhibited the activity of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated dihydroxyacetone kinase in a noncompetitive manner. the rate of  pep-dependent phosphorylation of dihydroxyacetone kinase was about 200-fold slower than the phosphorylation rate of iii proteins (also called enzyme iii or factor iii), which so far have been considered the only phosphoryl acceptors of histidyl-phosphorylated hpr. p-dihydroxyacetone kinase was found to be able to transfer its phosphoryl group in a backward reaction to hpr. following [32p]pep-dependent phosphorylation and tryptic digestion of dihydroxyacetone kinase, we isolated a labeled peptide composed of 37 amino acids, as determined by amino acid analysis. the single histidyl residue of this peptide most likely carries the phosphoryl group in phosphorylated dihydroxyacetone kinase.

TI  == immunocompromised animal models for the study of antibiotic combinations.
AB  == studies of various models of pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in neutropenic animals have demonstrated the superiority of the combination of beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics when compared with a single drug alone. a limited number of studies carried out in models of klebsiella pneumoniae infections in neutropenic animals have shown similar results. the efficacy of double beta-lactam combinations for the treatment of gram-negative bacillary infections  has not been studied as extensively; the few available reports did not show any benefit over a single beta-lactam treatment. most studies of combined therapy in  gram-positive infections have been performed in the experimental endocarditis model. experiments in staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus viridans, and streptococcus faecalis endocarditis have shown a clear-cut advantage for combined beta-lactam/aminoglycoside treatment over single beta-lactam therapy, as predicted by in vitro tests. the enhanced efficacy of combined beta-lactam/aminoglycoside treatment in both gram-negative bacillary and gram-positive coccal infections appears to result in most studies in increased and faster killing of the bacteria. with p. aeruginosa infections, however, experiments in neutropenic mice suggest that in addition to increased killing, the beta-lactam arm of the combined treatment prevents the emergence of the small colony variants that lead to treatment failures during therapy with aminoglycoside alone. for both gram-negative bacillary and gram-positive coccal infections, in vitro tests that demonstrated synergism for the combined antibiotics generally predicted enhanced therapeutic efficacy in vivo. conversely, when no synergism was demonstrated in vitro, there was generally no increased efficacy of combined treatment in vivo. animal models add a dimension to our understanding of the efficacy of antibiotics, both singly and in combination, that is not always apparent from the results of in vitro tests alone. these in vivo tests can be of value when planning clinical trials.

TI  == evaluations of tyrosine apodecarboxylase assays for pyridoxal phosphate.
AB  == the alternate procedures used in the tyrosine apodecarboxylase assays for pyridoxal 5'-phosphate were evaluated to determine optimal conditions. two preparations of tyrosine apodecarboxylase from streptococcus faecalis were used:  a cell suspension and a partially purified cell-free form. the activity of the decarboxylase was measured in two different assays using [14c]tyrosine or [3h]tyrosine as substrate. the presence of serum proteins caused greater inhibition of the assay for serum pyridoxal phosphate using [14c]tyrosine as substrate than the assay with [3h]tyrosine. in contrast, addition of deproteinized serum extract did not appear to inhibit either assay. the rate of reconstitution of the apodecarboxylase in the cell suspension was at least four times slower than that of the cell-free enzyme. the rate of reconstitution of the cell-free enzyme was faster in acetate than in citrate buffer. inorganic sulfate  or phosphate, at normal plasma concentrations, did not alter either the reconstitution rate of tyrosine decarboxylase or the final activity obtained in the assays using either substrate. the tyrosine apodecarboxylase assay for pyridoxal phosphate can be optimized by using deproteinized sera or plasma and incubating the cell-free apoenzyme with the coenzyme in acetate buffer for a time sufficient to obtain maximum reconstitution.

TI  == identification and partial purification of a dipeptidyl aminopeptidase from streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == a dipeptidyl aminopeptidase was identified in streptococcus faecalis jh2ss and was partially purified (approximately 245-fold) by hplc. gel filtration chromatography indicated an mr of 140 000. the partially purified enzyme exhibited a requirement for co2+. the ph optimum for the hydrolysis of l-val-l-ala-p-nitroanilide was approximately 9.5. the apparent km for this substrate was 0.22 mm. the enzyme preferentially hydrolysed x-ala-y substrates, but also utilized x-pro-y substrates, and therefore is most closely related to the mammalian dipeptidyl aminopeptidase ii (ec 3.4.14.-). the enzyme was inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoate, but not by iodoacetate, n-ethylmaleimide or the serine protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride.

TI  == identification of regions of the streptococcus faecalis plasmid pcf-10 that encode antibiotic resistance and pheromone response functions.
AB  == the conjugative plasmid pcf-10 (58 kb) of streptococcus faecalis has been mapped  with restriction enzymes. by restriction mapping and southern hybridization analysis, a 16-kb segment of the plasmid was shown to resemble closely the conjugative tetracycline resistance transposon, tn916. mutagenesis of the plasmid with the erythromycin resistance transposon tn917 was used to localize a tetracycline resistance determinant and several regions involved in conjugal transfer. fifty tn917 insertions (outside the region of the plasmid homologous to tn916) affecting mating behavior and the ability of donor cells to respond to the sex pheromone ccf-10 were mapped to nine distinct segments, or tra regions. insertions into tra regions 1-3 and 7-9 led to an enhanced transfer ability of mutant plasmids relative to the transfer frequency obtained for the wild-type plasmid. cells carrying these mutant plasmids differed in colony morphology or growth in broth culture from cells carrying pcf-10. insertions into tra regions 4-6 resulted in reduced plasmid transfer, or completely eliminated the mating potential of donor cells. insertions generating transfer-defective plasmids could be grouped further according to the ability of strains harboring the mutant plasmids to respond to ccf-10. hindiii fragments of pcf-10 coding for transfer functions have been cloned into escherichia coli.

AB  == in order to study the antimicrobial activity of amniotic fluid, attempts were made to evaluate the in vivo growth of bacteria in amniotic fluid and the role of transferrin in antibacterial activity. the bacteria chosen for these experiments  were escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus faecalis, respectively. the results obtained were as follows: amniotic fluid was shown have an antibacterial effect on escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus, while pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus faecalis proliferated readily in amniotic fluid. individual difference in each sample appeared to be responsible for the inconsistent potency of the inhibitory effect  observed. when amniotic fluid was heated at 100 degrees c for 5 minutes, the antibacterial activity was lost. the level of transferrin in amniotic fluid obtained at term was determined to be 29.1 +/- 17.6mg/dl (n = 90). the value correlated with neither those measured in cord sera nor maternal sera. the antimicrobial activity was restored by adding transferrin into heat-treated amniotic fluid at a concentration of 250mg/dl or higher. simultaneous addition of transferrin and a sufficient concentration of iron made it possible to form a transferrin-iron complex. a subsequent decrease in unbound transferrin resulted in the loss of antibacterial properties.

TI  == escherichia coli adherence to anion exchange resin. in vitro model for initial screening of potential antiadherence agents.
AB  == the first step in developing a bladder infection is attachment of bacteria to the bladder epithelium. removing the bladder mucin increases bacterial adherence up to a thousand-fold, and this increase can be prevented by pretreating the mucin-deficient bladder with heparin. to develop a rapid, in vitro antiadherence  screening assay, we studied the adherence of escherichia coli to various chromatography resins and the ability of heparin and other agents to antagonize this attachment. the results can be summarized as follows: although e. coli attached to all resins, only the adherence to the anion exchange resin was inhibited by heparin (up to 95%). agents which did not effect e. coli adherence to the resin did not affect attachment to the bladder. agents which inhibited e.  coli adherence to the bladder also inhibited e. coli adherence to the resin. similar to the effect of heparin on e. coli attachment, the adherence of klebsiella ozaene, proteus mirabilis, and streptococcus fecalis to both bladder epithelium and anion exchange resin were also antagonized. these studies indicate that the adherence of e. coli (as well as other bacterial species) to anion exchange resin responds to heparin and other chemical agents in a similar manner  as does adherence to the mucin-deficient rabbit urinary bladder. because of the ease and rapid nature of this in vitro assay, it serves as a useful screen for potential bacterial antiadherence agents and could be used to help elucidate mechanisms of bacterial attachment.

(1962) j. biol. chem. 237, 2647-2651], has been isolated as a uniform protein with specific activity 690 u/mg in a total yield of 50% by a two-step affinity chromatography procedure. the enzyme is metal-free and has a molecular mass of about 51 000 da and probably consists of a single polypeptide chain. as shown by fluorimetric titration, the prosthetic group is 1 mol fad/mol protein. the affinity behaviour of the enzyme gives evidence for the existence of a dinucleotide-binding domain capable of binding nadh or fad. the enzyme is specific for nadh (km = 4.1 x 10(-5) m), nadph is not oxidized. o2 is the preferred electron acceptor, in addition fad and, very slowly, one-electron acceptors are reduced. it is not clear whether the reduction of fad proceeds through the dinucleotide-binding site or by exchange of the prosthetic group. the stoichiometry of the reaction with o2 corresponds to the consumption of 2 mol nadh/mol o2, and only h2o is formed (2 nadh + 2 h+ + o2----2 nad+ + 2 h2o). neither h2o2 nor o2.- is detected as intermediate and h2o2 cannot  replace o2 as an oxidant. the enzyme can, mainly in its reduced state, be inhibited by -sh reagents. spectral data give no evidence for the existence of radical intermediates during reduction. the enzyme can obviously accept more than two electrons/mol. on the basis of these data two possible reaction mechanisms are discussed. a proposal for the biological purpose of the reaction is made.

AB  == the pattern of folacin in 180 human milk samples collected from 16 women was studied before and after pteroylglutamic hydroxylase (conjugase) treatment. the differential response of lactobacillus casei versus streptococcus faecalis distinguishes n-5-methyltetrahydrofolate from other forms. growth of pediococcus  cerevisiae differentiates the reduced monoglutamates, other than the n-5-methylated derivative, from oxidized folacins. mean folacin activity with l.  casei was 85.3 ng/ml. prior to conjugase treatment of samples, mean activity was  46.9 ng/ml with this organism. the responses of s. faecalis and p. cerevisiae were 48% and 7.6%, respectively, of the total l. casei active folacins. the total l. casei active folacins increased from 76.5 ng/ml at 6 weeks of lactation to 97.1 ng/ml at 12 weeks of lactation. increases were also observed with time of day: from morning (65.7 ng/ml), to afternoon (80.0 ng/ml), and to evening (114.7  ng/ml). hindmilk had greater total l. casei activity (100.0 ng/ml) than foremilk  (73.8 ng/ml). although folacins active for s. faecalis and p. cerevisiae were not affected by duration of lactation, increases in folacin activity with time of day and from fore- to hindmilk were observed using both of these organisms. values for the folacin content of human milk are therefore dependent on sampling procedures. pteroylpolyglutamates of greater than or equal to 3 glutamic acid residues and n-5-methyltetrahydrofolate are the predominant forms of human milk folacin based on differential growth responses of l. casei, s. faecalis, and p. cerevisiae to these forms.

TI  == bacterial colonization of hemasite access devices.
AB  == vascular access ports (hemasites) were recovered from patients in whom they had become foci of infection and were examined according to microbiologic and morphologic techniques. all were covered on their extraluminal surfaces by well-developed biofilms consisting of host material and bacteria and their extracellular products. one hemasite from which staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis were cultured was covered by a biofilm that consisted of coccoid bacterial cells and occasional fungal cells. another hemasite from which  proteus mirabilis was cultured was covered by a polymicrobial biofilm consisting  of at least six morphologically distinct bacterial types and their extracellular  products. this direct observation of the biofilm mode of bacterial growth on these devices suggests that the colonizing organisms will not be completely recovered by routine microbiologic techniques and that bacteria in the biofilm will tend to resist both host clearance mechanisms and antibiotic therapy. removal of the device, with its accretion of bacterial biofilm, should allow the  resolution of the associated infection.

TI  == antigenic composition of an endocarditis-associated isolate of streptococcus faecalis and identification of its glycoprotein antigens by ligand blotting with  lectins.
AB  == the antigenic composition of an endocarditis-associated isolate of streptococcus  faecalis was studied by immunoblotting of whole cells and cell walls from sodium-dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gels on to nitrocellulose and detection with serum from patients and hyperimmune rabbit serum. a major envelope protein antigen of mol. wt 53 x 10(3) detected with patient's serum was also present in three urinary strains of str. faecalis and a laboratory strain of str. faecalis ss. zymogenes but not in staphylococcus aureus. other common antigens of str. faecalis were of mol. wt (10(3)) 65, 63, 56, 49.5, 30 and 21. two other protein antigens (43 and 37 x 10(3) mol. wt) reacted strongly with asparagus pea lectin-peroxidase conjugate indicating the presence of fucosyl residues. other lectin-peroxidase conjugates were used to demonstrate the presence of various glycosyl residues on envelope proteins. growth of str. faecalis in serum to mimic in-vivo growth conditions in endocarditis infections dramatically altered the antigenic patterns. only two major antigens of mol. wt (10(3)) 56 and 53 reacted  with sera from endocarditis patients. these antigens may, therefore, be of diagnostic or protective potential.

TI  == highly efficient protoplast transformation system for streptococcus faecalis and  a new escherichia coli-s. faecalis shuttle vector.
AB  == a highly efficient protoplast transformation system for streptococcus faecalis has been developed by systematically optimizing different parameters. up to 10(6) transformants per micrograms of dna were consistently obtained within 3 days, and cell wall regeneration of protoplasts was virtually 100%. a systematic search for useful vectors showed that the broad-host-range plasmid pip501 could transform s. faecalis at a high frequency (6.3 x 10(4) transformants per microgram). by combining a high-copy-number derivative of pip501, designated pgb354, with the escherichia coli vector pacyc184, we constructed a new e. coli-s. faecalis shuttle vector (pam401) having nine unique restriction sites. in a shotgun cloning experiment, we ligated a tetracycline resistance determinant from streptococcus sanguis chromosomal dna into pam401 by direct transformation of s.  faecalis, establishing the utility of the protoplast transformation system and of the new shuttle vector.

TI  == identification of a streptococcus sanguis receptor for salivary agglutinins.
AB  == the objective of this study was to characterize a fraction from oral streptococci containing receptor activity for salivary agglutinin molecules. several species and strains of streptococci were disrupted in a ribi press. the supernatant was nuclease-treated and subjected to differential centrifugation. receptor activity  in the fractions was measured by the inhibition of saliva-mediated bacterial aggregation. in addition, bacterial strains were tested for their ability to aggregate and to deplete saliva of agglutinin activity. three patterns of activity were observed: streptococcus sanguis m5 depleted saliva of agglutinin activity and aggregated well; streptococcus sanguis cc5a depleted saliva of agglutinin but did not aggregate well; and streptococcus faecalis s-161 neither depleted saliva of agglutinin nor did it aggregate. the 105,000 g supernatant fractions derived from ribi-disrupted streptococcus sanguis m5 and cc5a, but not  from streptococcus faecalis, showed dose-dependent inhibition of saliva-mediated  aggregation. this inhibitory activity was non-dialyzable, had the same heat and trypsin sensitivity as that seen with intact bacteria, and was not due to enzymatic digestion of the salivary agglutinin. iso-electric focusing revealed a  single active region with a pi of 5.5 which was clearly separated from the bulk of the bacterial proteins.

TI  == comparative adhesion of seven species of streptococci isolated from the blood of  patients with sub-acute bacterial endocarditis to fibrin-platelet clots in vitro.
AB  == the adhesion to fibrin-platelet clots in vitro of 21 strains of streptococci isolated from the blood of patients with sub-acute bacterial endocarditis (sabe)  was measured. the species, in order of greatest adhesion, were streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus milleri, streptococcus sanguis, dextran-positive streptococcus mitior, dextran-negative streptococcus mitior and  streptococcus salivarius. individual strains within species, however, cannot be assumed to be representative of their species and may exhibit unusually high or low adhesion. adhesion depended upon both bacterial concentration and period of contact. there was no simple relationship between ability to adhere and liability to cause endocarditis. formation of dextran did not increase adhesion. the streptococci were more adhesive than strains of escherichia coli and neisseria sicca and less adhesive than strains of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes.

TI  == streptococcal cytoplasmic ph is regulated by changes in amount and activity of a  proton-translocating atpase.
AB  == the streptococcus faecalis h+-atpase (f1 x f0 complex) level was elevated when the cytoplasmic ph was shifted below 7.5. the elevated level was attained by the  increase in functional unit (f1 x f0 complex) in membranes, but not by the activation of the enzyme. our data strongly suggested that the increase in enzyme arises from stimulation of enzyme biosynthesis. when calls growing at ph 7.6 were transferred to an acid medium with a ph below 7, the amount of h+-atpase increased. the amount of h+-atpase decreased to the basal level when the medium was alkalized again. cytoplasmic ph was not controlled normally in cells where a  change in the amount of h+-atpase was inhibited. based on these findings and previous data (kobayashi, h. (1985) j. biol. chem. 260, 72-76), we propose a model for the regulatory mechanism of streptococcal cytoplasmic ph: the ph is regulated by changes in amount and activity of the h+-atpase, which are dependent on the cytoplasmic ph.

AB  == ten cases of bacterial endocarditis were observed in cirrhotic patients. in 7 cases, endocarditis was due to group d streptococcus, 5 of which were streptococcus d. bovis. special features were the involvement of tricuspid valve  and the involvement of two or more valves in 4 cases. surgery was necessary in the acute phase in 5 patients: cure was definitely obtained in 8 cases after a particularly long interval. a colonic lesion could have been the portal of entry  in some cases. liver cirrhosis was considered as a predisposing factor for bacterial endocarditis, especially due to group d streptococcus or to other bacteria of intestinal origin. this is probably related to the frequency of the colonic origin of group d streptococcus endocarditis. loss of filter function of  the liver may partly explain the features of these forms of endocarditis.

AB  == on the basis of bacteriological examinations carried out in april 1984 on 60 intranasal swabs, aerobic respiratory microbes were studied in rabbits. differences in flora between animals with and without respiratory diseases were studied. fourteen bacterial species were identified with no difference due to the pathological status. they were: bordetella bronchiseptica, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, pasteurella multocida, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus sp., branhamella catarrhalis, micrococcus sp., enterobacter agglomerans, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas paucimobilis, pseudomonas diminuta, alcaligenes faecalis and escherichia coli. however, young weaned rabbits were more often pasteurella carriers than adult females in maternity. the usefulness of performing only pasteurella and bordetella cultures in rabbits is questionable as is use of vaccines in order to prevent bacterial respiratory syndrome. it is emphasised that myxomatosis should be pursued in the investigation of respiratory infections in rabbit.

TI  == effects of norfloxacin on the faecal flora in patients with complicated urinary tract infections.
AB  == the effects on the long-term use of norfloxacin, a fluorinated 4-quinolone, on the intestinal flora (both aerobic and anaerobic), were evaluated in patients suffering from recurrent complicated urinary tract infections. eight patients received norfloxacin 400 mg b.i.d. for three months, and 11 patients received 400 mg b.i.d. for one month, and then 400 mg as an evening dose for two months. the concentration of enterobacteriaceae, staphylococci, streptococcus faecalis, and yeasts in stool specimens, together with the norfloxacin concentration were measured every month. the beta-aspartyl-glycine test was carried out at the same  time. no urinary tract infections, either of exogenous (pseudomonas spp.) or endogenous origin could be diagnosed during norfloxacin therapy. at both dosages  of norfloxacin the faecal samples were free of enterobacteriaceae due to low minimal bactericidal concentrations and high faecal drug concentrations. the suppressive effect was selective in that the anaerobic flora was left intact. a suppression of the aerobic intestinal flora could lead to an important reduction  of recurrent infections of the urinary tract in these patients.

AB  == ampicillin, fusidic acid, gentamicin, imipenem, mezlocillin, ofloxacin, penicillin g, piperacillin, and vancomycin were examined for inhibitory and bactericidal activity in various broth media against 7 clinical isolates of streptococcus faecalis. on a weight-for-weight basis, ampicillin, imipenem, mezlocillin, and ofloxacin proved to be more efficacious. all enterococcal isolates were resistant against gentamicin; fusidic acid and vancomycin lacked bactericidal activity. the combinations of either ampicillin, imipenem, mezlocillin, ofloxacin, piperacillin, or vancomycin with a subinhibitory concentration (4 micrograms/ml) of gentamicin, with or without added 65% (v/v) fresh defibrinated human blood, respectively, yielded additive effects against all enterococcal isolates. the addition of fresh human blood failed to enhance the antienterococcal activity of 4 micrograms/ml of gentamicin; in contrast, addition of 65% (v/v) fresh or heat-inactivated (56 degrees c, 30 min) normal rabbit, bovine, and human sera augmented the activity of gentamicin, an effect that was ablated through the addition of either 0.005 m dtt or 0.01 m mgcl2 + 0.01 m egta + 0.01 m cacl2, supplements known to antagonize human serum beta-lysin, but not lysozyme activity.

TI  == in vitro studies of plasmid-mediated penicillinase from streptococcus faecalis suggest a staphylococcal origin.
AB  == a strain of streptococcus faecalis with plasmid-mediated penicillinase production was studied further. partially purified penicillinase from the s. faecalis strain hydrolyzed penicillin, ampicillin, and ureido-penicillins but not penicillinase-resistant semisynthetic penicillins, cephalosporins, or imipenem; hydrolysis was inhibited by clavulanic acid. hydrolysis of a given antibiotic correlated with a marked increase in the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of that drug when a high inoculum was used. as with most enterococci, the mics of cephalosporins and penicillinase-resistant semisynthetic penicillins were too high for clinical usefulness, although these agents did not show an inoculum effect. based upon hybridization under stringent conditions of plasmid dna from the s. faecalis strain to cloned penicillinase genes from staphylococcus aureus,  it appears that these resistance determinants are highly homologous and suggests  that this enzyme was introduced into streptococci from staphylococci.

TI  == induction of surface exclusion (entry exclusion) by streptococcus faecalis sex pheromones: use of monoclonal antibodies to identify an inducible surface antigen involved in the exclusion process.
AB  == the streptococcus faecalis plasmid pcf-10 is representative of a class of plasmids that enables its host cells to respond to sex pheromones produced by other s. faecalis cells. the pheromone response has been previously shown to result in increased conjugal plasmid transfer, cell clumping, and multiple cell-surface antigenic changes. to test for other effects of pheromone induction, cells carrying pcf-10 were used as recipients in matings with an isogenic donor strain carrying a derivative of pcf-10, tagged with a transposon to provide an additional selective marker. pheromone induction of the "male recipients" decreased their recipient ability by a factor of 10-300 in comparison to uninduced cells or plasmid-free recipients. these results indicate that an entry  exclusion (surface exclusion) function, similar to that described in studies of plasmids in gram-negative bacteria, is induced during the s. faecalis pheromone response process. the exclusion operates only against homologous plasmids. immunological, biochemical, and genetic experiments using monoclonal antibodies reactive with c130, the predominant protein antigen associated with the pheromone response of cells carrying pcf-10, indicate that this antigen is involved in surface exclusion. the data also support the notion that synthesis of c130 involves a posttranslational modification of a precursor of c130 to a final product of higher molecular weight form.

TI  == further characterization of bacterial adherence to urinary bladder mucosa: comparison with adherence to anion exchange resin.
AB  == bacterial adherence to anion exchange resin has recently been reported to provide a useful, rapid, in vitro screening assay for identifying putative antiadherence  agents. the studies presented in this report provide additional evidence that adherence to anion exchange resin is similar to urinary bladder mucosa adherence. results are as follows. 1) heparin inhibits the adherence of escherichia coli, klebsiella ozaenae, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus fecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa to both the mucin deficient bladder and anion exchange resin. 2) drugs which inhibit e. coli adherence to the bladder also inhibit e. coli adherence to  the resin and conversely, drugs which do not effect e. coli adherence to the resin do not affect attachment to the bladder. 3) extracts from mammalian urinary bladder mucosa prevent e. coli adherence to both the bladder and resin. 4) the ability of heparin to displace preattached bacteria from anion exchange resin is  inversely proportional to the time the bacteria are in contact with resin. similar results were obtained for the ability of heparin to displace bacteria from the bladder. these studies indicate that bacterial adherence to anion exchange resin responds to heparin and other chemical agents in a manner similar  to the mucin deficient rabbit urinary bladder. because of the ease and rapid nature of this in vitro assay, it serves as a useful screen for potential bacterial antiadherence agents and could be used to help elucidate mechanisms of  bacterial attachment.

TI  == comparative kinetic studies on the two interconvertible forms of streptococcus faecalis inorganic pyrophosphatase.
AB  == in this work the two interconvertible forms of inorganic pyrophosphatase (ec 3.6.1.1) of streptococcus faecalis were shown to differ in kinetics. the highly active form of the enzyme was more sensitive to the changes in the mg2+ concentration, and thus also more sensitive to the inhibition caused by atp, which competes with ppi for the chelation of mg2+ ions. we have previously described a kinetic model for the less-active form of s. faecalis inorganic pyrophosphatase [lahti & jokinen (1985) biochemistry 24, 3526-3530]. the kinetic  model of the highly active enzyme form is proposed to be a modification of the model of the less-active form in which enzyme activation by free mg2+ is necessary for the reaction to occur. in this model the enzyme exists in two states, referred to as r- and t-states. in the absence of ligands the enzyme is in the t-state. r-state, i.e. the catalytically active state, exists only in the  presence of free mg2+. mg1ppi2- is the primary substrate, and free pyrophosphate  is a weak inhibitor that cannot serve as a substrate for the highly active form of s. faecalis inorganic pyrophosphatase. this model closely resembles that previously presented for yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase.

AB  == with a set of 17 bacteriophages specific for streptococcus faecalis and a set of  7 bacteriophages specific for streptococcus faecium 441 strains of s. faecalis and 53 strains of s. faecium were typed. the species identification was done by means of the api 20 strep system. for s. faecalis 22 and for s. faecium 12 lysotypes were found. among s. faecalis strains lysotype v6b was most common (27%), followed by the lysotypes xv (9,5%), xiii1 (7%), ii1 (5,7%), and i1 (4,3%). these 5 lysotypes comprised 54% of all 441 strains. 21% of the strains of s. faecalis and 6 from 53 strains of s. faecium were untypable. strains of s. faecium were most frequently isolated from faeces and in rare cases from urine. to the contrary 50% of the s. faecalis strains were isolated from urine. there was no correlation between special lysotypes and age of the patients or the source of specimen. the results of phage typing of several strains from one patient, and especially of strains from mothers and their newborns suggest the usefulness of the typing system to clarify epidemiological questions.

TI  == enzyme release of antigen from streptococcus faecalis and listeria monocytogenes  cross-reactive with lancefield group g typing reagents.
AB  == enzyme extraction methods are commonly used to release antigen for lancefield serogrouping of streptococci. recently, up to 47% of enterococci have been found  to possess antigens cross-reactive with both the group d and the group g grouping reagents. we investigated whether the organisms had recently emerged or whether changes in extraction methods (enzyme extraction) have resulted in our awareness  of their existence. we found that approximately 20% of our enterococcal isolates  released material cross-reactive with the group g reagents. these organisms have  been present for at least 6 years, and probably for many more. in addition, we found that most strains of listeria monocytogenes also released antigen cross-reactive with the group g reagent. the clinical significance of these findings is also discussed.

TI  == transferable resistance and aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes in enterococci.
AB  == ten isolates of streptococcus faecalis and two isolates of s. faecium were studied together with an nctc strain of each species. antibiotic susceptibility tests showed different patterns of high-level resistance to aminoglycosides. three s. faecalis strains were highly resistant to gentamicin and other aminoglycosides. by means of a filter membrane technique, transfer of high-level  resistance to aminoglycosides was demonstrated from s. faecalis to s. faecalis, from s. faecium to s. faecalis and from s. faecalis to s. faecium, the last of which has not previously been described. aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes were assayed with radiolabelled cofactors. high-level resistance to gentamicin and other aminoglycosides could be attributed to the production of 2''-o-phosphotransferases, 3'-o-phosphotransferases, 6-o-adenylyltransferases and 6'-n-acetyltransferases. other resistance mechanisms accounted for resistance in  two strains of s. faecalis and one strain of s. faecium that were highly resistant only to streptomycin and one s. faecalis strain that was moderately resistant to all aminoglycosides. a low level of 6'-n-acetyltransferases was detected in the three strains of s. faecium but this did not confer high-level resistance to aminoglycosides and this trait could not be transferred.

TI  == granulomatous enterocolitis induced in rats by purified bacterial cell wall fragments.
AB  == this study was designed to determine if poorly biodegradable bacterial cell wall  components can produce chronic intestinal inflammation. a sterile aqueous suspension of sonically disrupted group a or group d streptococcal cell wall fragments was injected intramurally into the small intestine and cecum of 100 rats. gross findings in rats killed at intervals of 1 day to 6 mo included intestinal thickening, adhesions, and mesenteric contraction. acute histologic inflammation subsided by 2 wk, but chronic granulomatous inflammation persisted for 6 mo in the rats injected with group a streptococcal cell wall fragments and  3 mo in the rats injected with group d streptococcal cell wall fragments. ninety-six control rats identically injected with human serum albumin or phosphate-buffered saline demonstrated mild acute inflammation that resolved, with only 1 rat having chronic intestinal inflammation. granulomas in the intestine, mesentery, and mesenteric lymph nodes developed in 46% of the rats injected with group a fragments and 45% of the rats injected with group d streptococcal cell wall fragments, compared with 20% of the controls injected with albumin and 4% of the controls injected with phosphate-buffered saline. group a streptococcal antigen was detected by immunofluorescence at the site of inflammation for 4 mo, and possible reactivation of acute inflammation was seen up to 6 mo after injection. we conclude that bacterial cell wall fragments are capable of producing chronic granulomatous inflammation in the intestinal wall if present in appropriate particle size and concentration. we speculate that cell walls from the enteric microflora may leak across a permeable mucosa in chronic inflammatory bowel disease to initiate and sustain local and systemic inflammation.

TI  == streptococcal phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system: purification  and characterization of a phosphoprotein phosphatase which hydrolyzes the phosphoryl bond in seryl-phosphorylated histidine-containing protein.
AB  == histidine-containing protein (hpr) of gram-positive bacteria was found to be phosphorylated at a seryl residue (p-ser-hpr) in an atp-dependent reaction catalyzed by a protein kinase (j. deutscher and m. h. saier, jr., proc. natl. acad. sci. u.s.a. 80:6790-6794, 1983). here we describe the purification and characterization of a soluble enzyme of streptococcus faecalis which splits the phosphoryl bond in p-ser-hpr. the enzyme has a molecular weight of ca. 7.5 x 10(4), as determined by its migration behavior on a sephacryl s-200 column. on native polyacrylamide gels the purified enzyme produced only one protein band. on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels we found one major protein band of molecular weight 2.9 x 10(4) and two minor protein bands of molecular weights 2.3 x 10(4) and 7 x 10(4). fructose 1,6-diphosphate, which stimulated the atp-dependent, protein kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of hpr, had no effect on  the phosphatase activity. other glycolytic intermediates also had no effect. however, inorganic phosphate, which inhibited the atp-dependent hpr kinase, stimulated the p-ser-hpr phosphatase. edta at a concentration of 0.1 mm completely inhibited the phosphatase. divalent cations like mg2+, mn2+, and co2+  overcame the inhibition by edta. fe2+, zn2+, and cu2+ had no effect, whereas ca2+ slightly inhibited the phosphatase. atp was also found to inhibit the phosphatase. under conditions in which atp severely inhibited the phosphatase, adp was found to have no effect on the enzyme activity. besides p-ser-hpr of s. faecalis, the phosphatase was also able to hydrolyze the phosphoryl bond in p-ser-hpr of streptococcus lactis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus pyogenes, and lactobacillus casei. phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside phosphorylation, catalyzed by the s. aureus phosphoenolpyruvate:lactose phosphotransferase system, was about 150-fold  decreased in the presence of p-ser-hpr of s. aureus, as compared with hpr. however, when p-ser-hpr was first incubated with p-ser-hpr phosphatase to allow complete hydrolysis of the phosphoryl bond, it had the same activity as hpr. besides this cytoplasmic phosphoprotein phosphatase, we detected a membrane-bound phosphatase which also hydrolyzed the phosphoryl bond in p-ser-hpr.

AB  == ten volunteers received three doses of 500 mg ciprofloxacin, orally every 12 hours. after the last dose, mean serum levels were (mg/l +/- sd) 2.4 +/- 0.83 at  1 h; 0.91 +/- 0.30 at 4 h and 0.18 +/- 0.04 at 12 h. at 1 h the median serum bactericidal activity was satisfactory only against the escherichia coli (1:256)  and klebsiella pneumoniae (1:128). in urine collected from 0 to 4 h and 8 to 12 h after the last dose, the mean ciprofloxacin level was respectively 482.5 +/- 324.7 and 80.9 +/- 48.2 mg/l +/- sd. bactericidal activity in urine was high even against the least susceptible species tested: pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis. a post antibiotic effect was demonstrated in 22 out of the 29 strains tested, ranging mainly from 1 to 3 h. ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice a day is a bactericidal regimen against a wide  range of urinary pathogens but has a limited systemic activity.

TI  == phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system. 1h nmr studies on chemically modified hpr proteins.
AB  == the low-pk tyrosyl residue present in the heat-stable proteins (hpr) of all gram-positive bacteria studied until now has been labeled by tetranitromethane in the hpr of bacillus subtilis and streptococcus faecalis. the nitrotyrosyl derivatives obtained are fully active in the complementation assay. the labeled tyrosyl residues could be identified as tyr-37 in both proteins. reinvestigation  of the low-pk tyrosyl residue in hpr of staphylococcus aureus resulted in the same assignment. in all three proteins an interaction between nitrotyrosine-37 and the active center his-15 could be observed, leading to an increase in the pk  of his-15 and a change of its chemical shift parameters. the 1h nmr lines of the  complete aromatic spin system of hpr of b. subtilis could be assigned by the nitration studies. labeling of arg-17 in hpr of s. aureus and s. faecalis by 1,2-cyclohexanedione in the presence of borate ions causes an almost complete inhibition of its enzymatic activity. in the nmr spectrum the labeling of the arginyl residue influences the resonance lines of his-15: two new resonance lines for the c-2 protons of equal intensity are observed, a fact that could be explained by two different conformations in slow exchange. the pk value of his-15 was not changed by the labeling, excluding arg-17 as responsible for the low pk of his-15.

AB  == an antibacterial substance (liq 4) produced by streptococcus faecalis var. liquefaciens k 4 was isolated in extracellular and cell associated form. it markedly inhibited the growth of gram-positive bacteria, whereas only a few gram-negative bacteria were susceptible. liq 4 was purified by hydrophobic chromatography (servachrome xad-2; octyl-sepharose cl-4b; sephadex lh 60) and sephacryl s-200. tlc yielded a fluorescent spot as the active component and several inactive ninhydrin-positive substances. these contaminating peptides strongly adsorbed to liq 4 and could only be removed by repeated reversed phase hplc. furthermore, hplc separated liq 4 into seven closely related substances. all showed strong fluorescence under uv light, stained yellow with ninhydrin, and contained aspartate and lysine after acid hydrolysis. the molecular weight was estimated by amicon ultrafiltration to be less than 2000. liq 4 was stable at 80  degrees c (30 min) and ph 2, but considerably inactivated above ph 8. it was apparently affected by proteolytic enzymes, but the activity could be fully restored upon heating.

TI  == kinetic model for the action of the inorganic pyrophosphatase from streptococcus  faecalis.
AB  == kinetic studies of the less active form of streptococcus faecalis inorganic pyrophosphatase (ec 3.6.1.1), together with computational analysis, indicated that cooperativity in ligand binding contributes in a significant way to the behavior of this enzyme. the simplest model applicable to our data was a monod-wyman-changeux-type, allosteric model, in which the enzyme is proposed to exist in two states, referred to as r and t states, respectively. in the absence  of ligands, 94% of the enzyme was in the t state. mgppi2- was the only substrate  for the enzyme in the r form. this substrate was bound equally well by both enzyme forms, but it was hydrolyzed 5 times more efficiently by the r form than it was by the t form. mg2ppi was bound exclusively to the t state of the enzyme,  and it was hydrolyzed 25% as rapidly as mgppi2- by the t form. mg2ppi inhibited the hydrolysis of the more efficient substrate, mgppi2-, by competing with mgppi2- for the enzyme in the t form and by shifting the r----t equilibrium in favor of the t form. mg2+ stabilized the r state, thus activating the hydrolysis  of mgppi2- and inhibiting that of mg2ppi.

TI  == antagonistic effect of penicillin-amikacin combinations against enterococci.
AB  == amikacin has been shown to antagonize the bactericidal effect of penicillin against strains of streptococcus faecalis which produce aminoglycoside 3'-phosphotransferase. the mechanism by which this phenomenon occurs was studied  with an enzyme-producing strain (8436) and an enzyme-negative strain (8436c) derived by curing the former with novobiocin. combinations of amikacin with beta-lactam antibiotics were antagonistic against strain 8436 but synergistic against strain 8436c. against strain 8436 penicillin-amikacin combinations resulted in levels of killing comparable to those seen with high concentrations of penicillin (500 micrograms/ml), which were less bactericidal than lower concentrations of penicillin. no antagonism was observed between amikacin and non-beta-lactam cell wall-active drugs or between penicillin and kanamycin or neomycin, both of which are substrates for the enzyme. at concentrations near the mic, amikacin was bactericidal against strain 8436c but bacteriostatic against strain 8436 (mic, 250 micrograms/ml; mbc, 2,000 micrograms/ml). neither penicillin nor phosphorylated amikacin affected the inhibition of ribosomal protein synthesis by amikacin in a cell-free system. although antagonism of killing by amikacin in enzyme-positive strains was specific for combinations which included beta-lactam antibiotics, amikacin did not influence the binding of [3h]penicillin to penicillin-binding proteins in isolated bacterial cell membranes or in intact cells and did not detectably affect the autolytic system of cells exposed to penicillin. antagonism of beta-lactam activity by a bacteriostatic effect of amikacin against the enzyme-producing strain is the most likely explanation for this phenomenon.

TI  == barotolerant variant of streptococcus faecalis with reduced sensitivity to glucose catabolite repression.
AB  == physiological characterization of the apr-11 variant of streptococcus faecalis atcc 9790 revealed that the variant has reduced sensitivity to glucose catabolite repression. this reduced sensitivity was indicated by the synthesis of enzymes for catabolism of lactose or arginine in cultures growing at 0.1, 40, or 70 mpa in media with levels of glucose highly repressive for the parent strain. reduced  catabolite repression appeared to be due to reduced activity of the glucose-specific, phosphotransferase system in apr-11 cells. conversion of pyruvate to lactate or to acetate and ethanol did not appear to be altered in the variant. the apr-11 variant produced a greater final yield of biomass than the parent at all pressures tested, and its barotolerance was especially marked in media with low levels of glucose and high levels of lactose in which derepression of the lactose catabolic system was necessary for full growth. overall, the greater barotolerance of the apr-11 strain appeared to be due to its enhanced capacity for catabolism related to its reduced sensitivity to catabolite repression by glucose.

TI  == comparison of single doses of amoxicillin or of amoxicillin-gentamicin for the prevention of endocarditis caused by streptococcus faecalis and by viridans streptococci.
AB  == recent recommendations for the prophylaxis of endocarditis in humans have advocated single doses or short courses of antibiotic combinations (beta-lactam plus aminoglycoside) for susceptible patients in whom enterococcal bacteremia might develop or for patients at especially high risk of developing endocarditis  (e.g., patients with prosthetic cardiac valves). we tested the prophylactic efficacy (in rats with catheter-induced aortic vegetations) of single doses of amoxicillin plus gentamicin against challenge with various streptococcal strains  (two strains of streptococcus faecalis, one of streptococcus bovis, and three of  viridans streptococci); we then compared this efficacy with that of single doses  of amoxicillin alone. successful prophylaxis against all six strains was achieved with single doses of both amoxicillin alone and amoxicillin plus gentamicin. this protection, however, was limited, for both regimens, to the lowest bacterial-inoculum size producing endocarditis in 90% of control rats and was not extended to higher inocula by using the combination of antibiotics. we concluded  that a single dose of amoxicillin alone was protective against enterococcal and nonenterococcal endocarditis in the rat, but that its efficacy was limited and could not be improved by the simultaneous administration of gentamicin.

TI  == treatment of streptococcal infective endocarditis.
AB  == patients with infective endocarditis caused by penicillin-sensitive streptococci  (minimal inhibitory concentration for penicillin of 0.1 microgram/ml or less) may be treated successfully with one of the following regimens: aqueous penicillin g  administered intravenously for four weeks, intravenous aqueous penicillin g for four weeks combined with streptomycin for the first two weeks of therapy, or parenterally administered penicillin plus streptomycin for two weeks. a cure rate of at least 98 percent may be anticipated with each of these regimens. during a 12-year period among 142 patients treated for two weeks with penicillin and streptomycin, one (0.7 percent) had relapse and four (3 percent) had vestibular toxicity. the major advantage of the two-week regimen is that it is more cost-effective than the four-week regimens. the major disadvantage of the use of  streptomycin is the relatively low risk of vestibular toxicity. patients with enterococcal endocarditis were treated initially for four weeks with aqueous penicillin g together with either streptomycin (streptomycin-susceptible enterococci, 36 patients) or gentamicin (streptomycin-resistant enterococci, 20 patients). compared with patients who had symptoms for less than three months, patients with symptoms for longer than three months had a higher relapse rate (0  percent versus 44 percent; p less than 0.001) and mortality (2.5 percent versus 25 percent; p less than 0.001). patients with mitral valve endocarditis had a significantly higher relapse rate (25 percent) than patients with aortic valve infection (0 percent; p less than 0.01]. gentamicin-associated nephrotoxicity was more frequent (p less than 0.001) among patients treated with more than 3 mg/kg per day of gentamicin than among those treated with 3 mg/kg per day or less (100  percent versus 20 percent). relapse and mortality rates did not differ significantly between patients treated with low-dose or high-dose gentamicin regimens. patients who have had symptoms of enterococcal endocarditis for longer  than three months or perhaps patients with mitral valve infection should receive  at least six weeks of penicillin therapy together with an aminoglycoside; patients without either high-risk factor may be treated successfully for four weeks.

AB  == the basis of the bactericidal activity of human lysozyme against streptococcus sanguis was studied. experiments were designed to evaluate the role of lysozyme muramidase activity in its bactericidal potency. inactivation of the muramidase activity of lysozyme was achieved by reduction of essential disulfides with dithiothreitol (dtt) or by incubation with the chitin oligosaccharides chitotriose and chitobiose. muramidase-inactive lysozyme, prepared by reduction with dtt, was equal in bactericidal potency to native lysozyme. solutions of native chicken egg white lysozyme and human lysozyme exhibited equal bactericidal potency yet differed ca. fourfold with respect to lytic (muramidase) activity. the above results suggested that the bactericidal activity of lysozyme is not dependent upon muramidase activity. chitotriose and chitobiose were found to inhibit both lytic and bactericidal activities of lysozyme. the bactericidal activity of muramidase-inactive lysozyme (reduction with dtt) was also inhibited  by chitotriose and chitobiose. further investigations demonstrated that chitotriose and chitobiose were also potent inhibitors of the bactericidal activity of the cationic homopolypeptides poly-l-arginine and poly-d-lysine. these latter results suggested that the essential bactericidal property of lysozyme was its extreme cationic nature and that some bacterial endogenous activities, inhibitable by chitotriose and chitobiose, were essential for expression of the bactericidal activity of either native or muramidase-inactive lysozyme or of the cationic homopolypeptides. experiments with streptococcus faecalis whole cells, cell walls, and crude autolysin preparations implicated endogenous autolytic muramidases as the bacterial targets of chitotriose and chitobiose. the essentially identical responses of s. sanguis and s. faecalis to  chitotriose in bactericidal assays with muramidase-inactive lysozyme and polylysine suggested that muramidase-like enzymes exist in s. sanguis and, furthermore, play an essential role in cationic protein-induced loss of viability of the oral microbe.

TI  == uv inactivation of pathogenic and indicator microorganisms.
AB  == survival was measured as a function of the dose of germicidal uv light for the bacteria escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, shigella sonnei, streptococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and bacillus subtilis spores, the enteric viruses poliovirus type 1 and simian rotavirus sa11, the cysts of the protozoan acanthamoeba castellanii, as well as for total coliforms and standard plate count microorganisms from secondary effluent. the doses of uv light necessary for a 99.9% inactivation of the cultured vegetative bacteria, total coliforms, and standard plate count microorganisms were comparable. however, the viruses, the bacterial spores, and the amoebic cysts required about 3 to 4 times, 9 times, and 15 times, respectively, the dose required for e. coli. these ratios covered a narrower relative dose range than that previously reported for chlorine disinfection of e. coli, viruses, spores, and cysts.

TI  == streptococcus faecalis sex pheromone (cam373) also produced by staphylococcus aureus and identification of a conjugative transposon (tn918).
AB  == streptococcus faecalis rc73 was found to harbor a conjugative plasmid (pam373) which confers a mating response to a sex pheromone (cam373) excreted by plasmid-free members of the same species. the pheromone was also detected in culture filtrates of all of 23 staphylococcus aureus strains but in only 2 of 22  coagulase negative staphylococcus strains. streptococcus sanguis challis and g9b  also produced the activity, but 10 other streptococcus sanguis strains did not. the activity was also produced by streptococcus faecium 9790. a tetracycline resistance (tc) determinant present in s. faecalis rc73 was not associated with pam373 but served as a useful marker in efforts to identify pam373 among other plasmids present in the strain. analyses of the tc determinant showed that it was located on a conjugative transposon very similar to tn916. designated tn918, the  transposon could insert into pam373 as well as into two other hemolysin plasmids. whereas pam373 derivatives transferred very well between strains of streptococcus faecalis, the plasmid would not establish in staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus sanguis. however, a derivative of pam373 carrying tn918 proved to be a useful delivery vehicle for generating transposon insertions into multiple sites on the staphylococcal chromosome.

TI  == in vitro effects of sulphasalazine, azodisal sodium, and their metabolites on clostridium difficile and some other faecal bacteria.
AB  == the effects of sulphasalazine (sasp), azodisal sodium (ads), and their metabolites were tested in vitro on aerobic and anaerobic faecal bacterial strains. sulphapyridine (sp) had a mild to moderate effect on escherichia coli and streptococcus faecalis. sasp also had a growth-inhibitory effect on strep. faecalis. the other substances had no effect on the aerobic strains. sasp, sp, 5-aminosalicylic acid, and, to a certain extent, n-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid exerted a growth-inhibitory effect on the anaerobic strains. of special interest  was the inhibitory effect on clostridium difficile strains. in recent years the possibility that overgrowth of cl. difficile could cause flare-ups of inflammatory bowel disease has been discussed. some studies suggested that sasp treatment could predispose to cl. difficile superinfection, whereas others found  sasp more probable to exert a prophylactic effect. our findings support the theory that sasp treatment reduces rather than promotes the risk of cl. difficile superinfection.

AB  == high-molecular-weight surface antigens, obtained by ammonium sulfate precipitation of culture supernatants and identified in western blots of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, have been correlated with the sex pheromone  response of streptococcus faecalis donor cells. pheromone-induced cells carrying  the conjugative plasmid pcf10 produced both an antigenic component (c130) composed of at least four bands in the range of 130 kilodaltons and a 73-kilodalton antigen (sa 73). the concentration of the c130 antigen in culture supernatants increased with time after exposure of donor cells to pheromone preparations. gel filtration studies indicated that this antigen exists in the native state as a very large complex that is more than 180,000 daltons in size. the c130 antigen was susceptible to digestion by proteinase k and was not reactive with either concanavalin a or wheat germ agglutinin. the antigenicity of c130 was not destroyed by treatment of blots with trypsin, chymotrypsin, or papain before development with antibody, whereas the antigenicity of sa73 was susceptible to these treatments.

TI  == purification of an alanine racemase from streptococcus faecalis and analysis of its inactivation by (1-aminoethyl)phosphonic acid enantiomers.
AB  == an alanine racemase has been purified some 30 000-fold almost to homogeneity from gram-positive streptococcus faecalis ncib 6459; the enzyme has been purified to the same extent (4000-fold) from an o-carbamyl-d-serine-resistant mutant with a 7-fold higher enzyme level in crude extract. the racemase has one pyridoxal phosphate molecule per 42-kda subunit, has a vmax of 3570 units/mg and a km of 7.8 mm in the l to d direction, and has a vmax of 1210 units/mg and a km of 2.2 mm in the d to l direction. the keq is 0.8 and kcat/km values are ca. 3 x 10(5) m-1 s-1. the purified enzyme is inhibited in a time-dependent manner by both l- and d-(l-aminoethyl)phosphonates (ala-p), confirming observations of atherton et  al. in crude extracts of this organism [atherton, f. r., hall, m. j., hassal, c.  h., holmes, s. w., lambert, r. w., lloyd, w. j., & ringrose, p. s.

TI  == influence of the developmental state of valvular lesions on the antimicrobial activity of cefotaxime in experimental enterococcal infections.
AB  == cefotaxime has little antimicrobial activity in vitro against most strains of enterococci, as measured by conventional mics and mbcs. however, the mics of cefotaxime against many enterococci are markedly reduced by the addition of serum to the test medium. to assess the relevance of this observation in vivo, we examined the efficacy of cefotaxime in experimental streptococcus faecalis endocarditis. since response to antimicrobial agents may vary with the degree of  vegetation development, therapeutic efficacy was assessed both in rabbits with newly formed vegetations and in rabbits with well-developed endocardial lesions.  peak serum levels of cefotaxime (50.1 +/- 20.0 micrograms/ml) exceeded the mic in medium supplemented with serum (4 micrograms/ml), but not in mueller-hinton broth alone (greater than 64 micrograms/ml). after 4 days of therapy, animals with newly formed lesions (therapy initiated 1 h after infection, transvalvular catheters removed) had lower mean vegetation bacterial titers than did untreated  controls. among animals with mature vegetations (therapy initiated 12 h after infection, catheters indwelling), the rate of mortality was significantly reduced by cefotaxime therapy. however, no difference in vegetation titers was observed.  thus, cefotaxime demonstrated antienterococcal activity within newly formed vegetations, but did not inhibit bacterial proliferation within well-established  vegetations.

(great britain) and difco laboratories (usa). the physico-chemical and physiological characteristics of the proposed medium have been determined. the use of the new dried culture medium in medical practice will make it possible to  improve the microbiological diagnosis of streptococcal infections.

TI  == mucin degradation in human colon ecosystems. isolation and properties of fecal strains that degrade abh blood group antigens and oligosaccharides from mucin glycoproteins.
AB  == we previously reported that the oligosaccharide chains of hog gastric mucin were  degraded by unidentified subpopulations numbering approximately 1% of normal human fecal bacteria. here we report on the enzyme-producing properties of five strains of mucin oligosaccharide chain-degrading bacteria isolated from feces of  four healthy subjects. four were isolated from the greatest fecal dilutions yielding mucin side chain-degrading activity in culture, and thus were the numerically dominant side chain-degrading bacteria in their respective hosts. three were ruminococcus strains and two were bifidobacterium strains. two ruminococcus torques strains, ix-70 and viii-239, produced blood group a- and h-degrading alpha-glycosidase activities, sialidase, and the requisite beta-glycosidases; these strains released greater than 90% of the anthrone-reacting hexoses from hog gastric mucin during growth in culture. the bifidobacterium strains lacked a-degrading activity but were otherwise similar; these released 60-80% of the anthrone-reacting hexoses but not the a antigenic structures from hog gastric mucin. only ruminococcus ab strain vi-268 produced blood group b-degrading alpha-galactosidase activity, but this strain lacked beta-n-acetylhexosaminidases to complete degradation of b antigenic chains. when  this strain was co-cultured with a strain that produced beta-n-acetylhexosaminidases, release of hexoses from blood group b salivary glycoprotein increased from 50 to greater than 90%, and bacterial growth was enhanced. the glycosidases required for side chain degradation were produced by these strains in the absence of mucin substrate, and a substantial fraction of each activity in stationary phase cultures was extracellular. in contrast, none of 16 other fecal bacteroides, escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, and bifidobacterium strains produced abh blood group-degrading enzymes; other glycosidases produced by these strains were predominantly cell bound except for extracellular beta-n-acetylhexosaminidases produced by the five s. faecalis strains. we conclude that certain bifidobacterium and ruminococcus strains are numerically dominant populations degrading mucin oligosaccharides in the human colon due to their constitutive production of the requisite extracellular glycosidases including blood group antigen-specific alpha-glycosidases. these properties characterize them as a functionally distinct subpopulation of normal human enteric microflora comprised of specialized subsets that produce blood group h antigen-degrading glycosidases alone or together with either blood group  a- or b-degrading glycosidases.

AB  == we describe the characterization of ktrii, a novel potassium transport system of  streptococcus faecalis, first discovered by h. kobayashi [1982) j. bacteriol. 150, 506-511). ktrii requires sodium ions and mediates the stoichiometric exchange of internal na+ for external k+. potassium accumulation is not energized by the electrochemical potentials of either h+ or na+; the energy source is probably atp. two lines of evidence indicate that ktrii is a manifestation of the sodium-stimulated atpase reported earlier (heefner, d. l., and harold, f. m. (1982) proc. natl. acad. sci. u.s.a. 79, 2798-2802). (i) mutants that lack the atpase also lack ktrii, and revertants recover both in parallel. (ii) ktrii and the na+-atpase are induced in parallel when cells are grown on media rich in sodium, particularly under conditions that limit the generation of a proton potential. ktrii is not induced in response to k+ deprivation. we propose that the na+-atpase exchanges na+ for k+ ions.

TI  == a proton-translocating atpase regulates ph of the bacterial cytoplasm.
AB  == regulatory mechanisms of cytoplasmic ph in streptococcus faecalis with no respiratory chain were investigated. in a mutant defective in cytoplasmic alkalization conducted by a proton-translocating atpase (h+-atpase), the cytoplasmic ph is approximately 0.4 to 0.5 ph units lower than the medium ph, at  ph 5.5 to 9.0. the cytoplasmic ph of the wild-type strain was always higher than  that of the mutant at a ph below 8 and was the same as that of the mutant at an alkaline ph over 8. thus, the cytoplasmic ph is regulated only by the cytoplasmic alkalization, and there is no regulation at alkaline ph in s. faecalis. a generation of the protonmotive force conducted by the h+-atpase depended on the cytoplasmic ph rather than the medium ph, and the generation decreased rapidly when the cytoplasmic ph was increased over 7.7. the decrease at alkaline ph was not caused by increases in the rate of proton influx. these results suggest that  cytoplasmic alkalization is diminished when alkaline ph of the cytoplasm is over  7.7, because of a low activity of proton extrusion by the h+-atpase, and consequently, the cytoplasmic ph is regulated at about 7.7. the cytoplasmic ph was regulated at a high level in cells that had a high level of h+-atpase. i conclude that in s. faecalis, the cytoplasmic ph is regulated by h+-atpase.

AB  == a strain of streptococcus faecalis isolated from the urogenital flora was selected for its ability to inhibit the in vitro growth of neisseria gonorrhoeae. initially, the inhibitory activity was demonstrated on solid medium only when the inhibitor and the target strains were growing simultaneously, such as in the spot-lawn and flip-flop agar overlay methods. the antigonococcal effect was not due to a shift in the ph or depletion of nutrient in the medium. this activity was not produced in liquid medium nor could it be extracted in a soluble form from either the solid medium or the streptococcal cells. the production of the inhibitory activity could not be enhanced by ultraviolet irradiation or treatment with mitomycin c. the composition of the medium was found to affect the size of the inhibitory zone produced. the inhibitory activity showed a wide antigonococcal spectrum and was susceptible to trypsin and pronase but resistant  to alpha- and beta-amylases and catalase. this activity passed through a filtering membrane and was also dialyzable and had an apparent molecular weight of less than 1,000. the addition of bovine serum albumin to solid medium enabled  us to show an inhibition even when the producer and the target strains were grown sequentially, thus suggesting that part of the difficulty of studying such inhibitory activity could be due to its instability.

TI  == characterization and mode of action of a purified bacteriocin from the oral bacterium streptococcus mutans rm-10.
AB  == the purified bacteriocin was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes such as trypsin, alpha-chymotrypsin and pronase, but resistant to papain and pepsin. lowering the  ph of the bacteriocin caused precipitation, and the abs280 of the supernatant reached a minimum at ph 3.6, suggesting that this is the isoelectric point. such  a ph value coincides with minimum bacteriocin activity. the effect of the bacteriocin was bactericidal rather than bacteriolytic and concentration dependent. treatment of streptococcus faecalis odu with rm-10 bacteriocin led rapidly to the cessation of biosynthesis of macromolecules, dna, rna and protein. electron microscopy showed bacteriocin fibres attached in aggregated bundles to target cells; after ultra-sonication or detergent treatment they were individually attached to the cell surface and, at the same time, the apparent bacteriocin activity had doubled. bacteriocin activity was not altered by filter-sterilized saliva components. oral rinsing with rm-10 bacteriocin reduced  the number of viable salivary bacteria after 20 min, suggesting a possible therapeutic use for rm-10 bacteriocin.

TI  == [evaluation of bacterial growth rate by the atp-bioluminescence method (luciferase assay)--comparison with conventional methods and application to clinical studies].
AB  == bacterial growth rate was evaluated by estimating the increase in atp content of  cultures of bacterial suspensions using luciferase assay, and the method was applied to the estimation of bactericidal activity of serum and anti-bacterial activity of antibiotics. the results obtained were as follows: the bacterial numbers or bacterial growth rate determined by the atp-bioluminescence method was in accordance with those by cfu assay and spectrometrical assay by optical density readings. furthermore this method was confirmed to be non-time-consuming  and more simple than other methods. using this method, anti-bacterial activity of fresh serum was evaluated. the serum suppressed the growth rate of e. coli, str.  fecalis, cbs, kleb. pneumoniae and staph. aureus at least for 2 hours. heat-inactivated serum and absorbed serum with bacteria tended to lose such suppressive effect. thus the main effective factors seem to be complements and specific antibody. the anti-microbial activity of antibiotics was enhanced by addition of fresh serum to bacterial cultures, and the results were not in accordance with those by the conventional disc method. thus the sensitivity test  under the influence of fresh serum is recommended in order to know the clinical effect of antibiotics. these results suggest the usefulness of atp-bioluminescence method in the clinical laboratory examinations or investigations.

TI  == susceptibility of enterococci to trimethoprim and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
AB  == the in vitro activities of trimethoprim (tmp), alone and in combination with sulfamethoxazole (smx), against 131 clinical isolates of enterococci, 126 streptococcus faecalis isolates, and 5 streptococcus faecium isolates were determined by a broth microdilution method with mueller-hinton broth that was substantially free of inhibitory substances. the geometric mean mic of tmp for strains of s. faecalis was 0.164 micrograms/ml (range, 0.03 to 8 micrograms/ml),  with a geometric mean mbc of 0.298 micrograms/ml (range, 0.063 to 8 micrograms/ml). although all strains were resistant to the sulfonamide alone, the inhibitory and bactericidal activities of tmp against strains of s. faecalis were markedly potentiated when tmp was combined in a fixed ratio of 1:19 with smx; the geometric mean mic of tmp was reduced to 0.016 micrograms/ml (range, 0.002 to 0.25 micrograms/ml), with a geometric mean mbc of 0.031 micrograms/ml (range, 0.004 to 0.25 micrograms/ml). the combination had no synergistic effect against strains of s. faecium; the geometric mean mics and mbcs of both agents were ca. 0.06 micrograms/ml. the mbc/mic ratios for tmp and tmp-smx were less than or equal to 16 for all 131 strains. mics and mbcs for tmp-smx were unchanged, and for tmp they decreased when performed in broth supplemented with 50% heat-inactivated pooled human serum. for tmp and tmp-smx, the susceptibilities of isolates with high-level resistance to gentamicin or streptomycin were the same as those of isolates susceptible to less than or equal to 2,000 micrograms of aminoglycoside per ml. these results suggest that tmp-smx and tmp alone could prove useful in the treatment of serious enterococcal infections, including infections by strains with high-level resistance to aminoglycosides.

TI  == survival and detection of bacteroides spp., prospective indicator bacteria.
AB  == preliminary experiments were performed to assess the use of intestinal bacteroides spp. as indicators of fecal contamination of water. viable counts of  bacteroides fragilis, an anaerobic bacterium, declined more rapidly than those of escherichia coli and streptococcus faecalis. however, a fluorescent antiserum prepared against b. fragilis successfully detected high proportions (18 to greater than 50%) of b. fragilis cells suspended for 8 days in aerobic water in dialysis bags at the ambient temperature. these percentages were higher than the  percent viable recoveries of the two indicator bacteria used for comparison. thus, the fluorescent antiserum test for b. fragilis might serve as a useful indicator of fecal contamination of water. an advantage of this approach over coliform analysis is the rapidity at which the test can be performed.

TI  == the effects of hypothermia on neutrophil function in vitro.
AB  == hypothermia may be associated with compromised host defenses and serious bacterial infections in man. we have examined the effects of moderate hypothermia (29 degrees c) on neutrophil function in vitro. at 29 degrees c, neutrophil phagocytosis of staphylococcus aureus was impaired. in contrast, neutrophil killing of streptococcus faecalis was most affected by hypothermia. phagocytosis, as measured by neutrophil ingestion of opsonized oil-red-o-particles, was reduced at 29 degrees c over the 15 min of observation. neutrophil metabolism linked to bactericidal pathways dependent on oxidative metabolism was reduced at 29 degrees c. hexose monophosphate pathway (hmp) activity in neutrophils early after stimulation with latex particles was reduced. after 2 hr hmp activity was similar at 29 degrees c and 37 degrees c. neotetrazolium dye reduction was reduced early  after latex stimulation of neutrophils and after 30 min it was similar to cells at 37 degrees c. leukocyte migration under agarose to bacterial-derived and formyl-methionyl-phenylalanine chemotactic factors was reduced by 50% and 70%, respectively. migration to serum-derived chemotactic factor was reduced by only 20%. when cells were cooled to 29 degrees c for 30 to 90 min and rewarmed, neutrophil function was normal. these effects of hypothermia on neutrophil function may explain, in part, the increased incidence of serious and frequently  fatal bacterial infections in man.

TI  == gram-positive superinfections following beta-lactam chemotherapy: the significance of the enterococcus.
AB  == the recent literature was reviewed with regard to the risks of superinfection following beta-lactam chemotherapy. the summary publications for the pseudomonas-active penicillins (azlocillin, carbenicillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin and ticarcillin), cefoperazone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, imipenem and moxalactam show marked variations. moxalactam was most likely to produce both gram-negative (5-38%) and enterococcal (2.2-12%) superinfections. ceftazidime or  moxalactam therapy was more often associated with anaerobic superinfections, usually by clostridium spp., than the other beta-lactams. comparable and lower incidences of superinfections were cited for cefoperazone, ceftazidime, mezlocillin and imipenem. the most common pathogens for the above drugs were the  fungi (candida spp.), pseudomonas spp. and some beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae. staphylococcal, escherichia coli and klebsiella spp. secondary infections were more common in patients receiving the newer penicillins. cefotaxime had a very low incidence of superinfections (1.1%), especially caused by gram-positive organisms such as enterococci. the reasons for this favorable feature seem to be: excellent inhibitory activity and beta-lactamase stability against a wide variety of bacterial pathogens, synergistic interactions of cefotaxime and its desacetyl metabolite, enhanced anti-enterococcal activity of cefotaxime in the presence of a human serum factor  and interactions of cefotaxime and desacetyl cefotaxime to suppress the development of antimicrobial resistance. the most common superinfections following cefotaxime treatment were with pseudomonas spp., enterobacter spp. and  fungi. cefotaxime appears to possess physical-chemical characteristics that react favorably with bacteria and the host to minimize gram-positive superinfections, especially with most enteric streptococcus spp. (streptococcus faecalis and streptococcus faecium).

TI  == recent aspects of genetic manipulation in bacillus thuringiensis.
AB  == the conjugative plasmid pam beta 1 was transferred from streptococcus faecalis to several strains of bacillus thuringiensis by a filter-mating process. from a transconjugant clone of b. thuringiensis a hybrid plasmid resulting from an in vivo insertion into pam beta 1 of a 3 md dna sequence was isolated. this 3 md dna molecule (th sequence) is related to several host plasmids found in different serotypes of b. thuringiensis. a reciprocal conjugation-like process involving the transfer of pam beta 1 from b. thuringiensis to s. faecalis was also demonstrated. the comparison of the restriction maps of the crystal genes from plasmid and chromosomal origins of different serotypes, six of which having been  cloned in e. coli, revealed the existence of two classes of genes which are very  similar in the map corresponding to the n-terminal part of the protein, and which differ essentially in the 3' region. the presence of the transposon-like th sequence was found in several cases associated with the crystal gene in the same  host plasmid, and a model for their structural organization is proposed.

TI  == molecular cloning of a pip501 derivative yields a model replicon for the study of streptococcal conjugation.
AB  == we have previously constructed a derivative of the broad host range streptococcal plasmid pip501, a conjugative plasmid designated pva797, that confers chloramphenicol resistance and contains a unique ecori site in a non-essential region of the plasmid molecule. pva797 (30.7 kb) when cloned in toto as an ecori  fragment into the positive selection vector pop203(a2+) gave a recombinant, pva904 (37.7 kb), which was able to replicate in escherichia coli and in streptococcal species. it can be phenotypically monitored in either genus by specific drug resistance markers (chloramphenicol resistance in streptococci, tetracycline resistance in e. coli). pva904 segregates into e. coli minicells where it specifies the production of at least 13 polypeptides. many of the polypeptides are missing in minicells containing a transfer-defective, deletion derivative of pva904. pva904 is an ideal model replicon for the study of streptococcal conjugation because it is a shuttle plasmid thus enabling manipulation using procedures established for e. coli. specifically, it should be possible to define the genetic basis of streptococcal conjugation by coupling mutagenesis protocols and minicell protein analyses in e. coli with evaluation of transfer function in streptococci.

AB  == although enterococcus is well recognized as a pathogen in endocarditis, urinary tract infections, and biliary sepsis, its role in other forms of intraabdominal sepsis remains controversial. antibiotics that lack activity against enterococcus can often be employed successfully in intraabdominal infections, even when enterococci are present as part of the polymicrobial flora. furthermore, the enterococcus rarely emerges as a blood borne pathogen in such a setting. breakthrough enterococcal septicemia may occur, however, in the immunodepressed host, particularly in the face of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy not specific  for enterococcus. like infections with other opportunistic pathogens, enterococcal sepsis under these circumstances carries a high mortality. specific  antienterococcal drug therapy may be indicated as an adjunct to surgical management in selected patients with intraabdominal sepsis.

TI  == comparison of latex agglutination and immunofluorescence for direct lancefield grouping of streptococci from blood cultures.
AB  == simulated positive blood cultures with 84 known stock strains of streptococci were used to comparatively evaluate the direct identification of these organisms  by fluorescein-tagged antibody staining (immunofluorescence [if]) and latex agglutination (la). if was not evaluated for lancefield group d strains (a total  of 81 strains tested) and had 89% sensitivity and 91% specificity. if was least sensitive for the identification of lancefield group f, in which three of seven strains showed no fluorescence with the group f reagent. since la was more convenient and revealed comparable sensitivities and specificities on 84 simulated cultures, we tested this procedure using an additional 29 fresh positive clinical blood cultures, for a total of 113 cultures tested by this technique. of 11 streptococcus pneumoniae strains, 9 reacted with the la group c  reagent, a problem not observed with if. however, all these strains were identified by a rapid modified bile solubility test. of the 12 streptococcus faecalis strains, 4 were falsely negative with the group d reagent, but all were  correctly identified by a rapid litmus milk reduction test. of 12 group a strains, 1 was not detected. of all 113 strains tested by la, eliminating s. faecalis and s. pneumoniae, the sensitivity and specificity were 97 and 98%, respectively. la was simple and reliable in the rapid identification of streptococci from blood cultures and appeared to be preferable to if. when la is  used, the group d reagent should not be used, and all samples reacting with the group c reagent should be tested by a modified rapid bile solubility test to exclude s. pneumoniae.

TI  == role of resistance to starvation in bacterial survival in sewage and lake water.
AB  == a study was conducted to determine the significance of starvation resistance to the ability of a species to survive in sewage and lake water. tests were conducted for periods of up to 14 days. rhizobium meliloti and one fluorescent and one nonfluorescent strain of pseudomonas were resistant to starvation because their population sizes did not fall appreciably in buffer and sterile lake water, and the first two maintained high numbers after being added to sterile sewage. cell densities of these bacterial species dropped slowly in nonsterile sewage, and more cells of these three organisms than of the other test organisms remained in nonsterile lake water. rhizobium leguminosarum was moderately resistant to starvation because its numbers fell slowly in buffer and sterile lake water and did not change appreciably in sterile sewage. the abundance of micrococcus flavus added to buffer and sterile lake water did not change, but the density of m. flavus declined in nonsterile lake water. the abundance of r. leguminosarum fell  in nonsterile lake water and nonsterile sewage. streptococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, an asporogenous strain of bacillus subtilis, and streptococcus sp. were susceptible to starvation because their populations were markedly reduced in buffer. populations of the last three species declined rapidly in nonsterile and sterile samples of lake water and sewage. s. faecalis declined rapidly when added to nonsterile lake water and sewage and sterile lake  water but not when added to sterile sewage, the persistence in the last instance  probably being associated with the availability of organic nutrients.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == hemolysin of streptococcus faecalis subspecies zymogenes contributes to virulence in mice.
AB  == the conjugative plasmid pad1 (56.7 kilobases) in streptococcus faecalis confers hemolysin-bacteriocin (hly-bcn) expression and a mating response to the sex pheromone cad1 excreted by recipient cells. we examined the contribution of hemolysin to pathogenicity in intraperitoneally infected mice by using tn916 and  tn917 insertion mutants altered in hemolysin expression. strains exhibiting the normal hemolysin phenotype were significantly more virulent than the nonhemolytic insertion mutants. a mutant plasmid with an increased copy number which gave rise to a larger-than-normal zone of hemolysis on blood agar rendered host strains more virulent than the wild-type streptococci in mice.

TI  == altered expression of the h+ atpase in streptococcus faecalis membranes.
AB  == evidence is presented that expression of the h+ atpase in s. faecalis is influenced by the extracellular ph and k+ level during growth. altered expression was detected by assay of f1 atpase and electrophoretic analysis of membrane proteins. k+-limited growth caused about a 2-fold increase in the f1 atpase. the  effect of growth at ph 6, 7 and 9 was studied. compared to cells grown at ph 7, growth at ph 6 increased the f1 atpase about 2-fold while growth at ph 9 reduced  the f1 atpase by nearly 4-fold. the elevated f1 atpase activity in the ph 6 cells was associated with an increase in the f1 atpase alpha and beta subunits in the membrane while the decrease in f1 atpase in the ph 9 cells was associated with a  marked loss of the alpha subunit. it is suggested that intracellular protons may  act as effectors which regulate expression of the f1f0 gene cluster at the level  of translation.

TI  == a turbidimetric and electron microscopic study of the effects of several parameters on the lysis of streptococcus faecalis by lysozyme.
AB  == the lytic effect of lysozyme on streptococcus faecalis atcc 9790 was studied by spectrophotometry and electron microscopy and it was found to be highly dependent on the ionic strength of the suspending media and on the ratio lysozyme to bacterial cell mass. when 7.2 x 10(8) bacteria/ml are exposed to 0.4 mg/ml of lysozyme in media with low ionic strength, the enzyme is bound in great amounts,  as deduced from protein determinations and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide  gel electrophoresis (sds--page); the binding prevents bacteriolysis in spite of the removal of the cell wall. extensive lysis of s. faecalis could be obtained by reducing the ratio of lysozyme to bacterial cell mass. stabilization of s. faecalis by lysozyme was also observed when exponential phase cells incubated under conditions that promote spontaneous autolysis (incubation in 0.05 m tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane buffer, ph 8.0, ionic strength = 0.01675) do not  lyse and do not leak material which absorbs at 260 nm when lysozyme was present at the highest concentration.

TI  == emerging patterns of microbial resistance.
AB  == microbial resistance arises by mutation or by inheritance. the latter is plasmid-mediated and transferable and may erode multidrug resistance to beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, macrolides, lincosamides, sulfonamides, and trimethoprim. resistance genes may transfer from one plasmid to another or from a plasmid to the chromosome or to a bacteriophage, thereby allowing rapid dissemination of resistance among bacteria. mutational or chromosomal resistance is not readily transferable between different bacterial species or genera but is nonetheless medically important for resistance to isoniazid, methicillin, nalidixic acid, rifampin, and expanded spectrum cephalosporins.

TI  == regeneration of insertionally inactivated streptococcal dna fragments after excision of transposon tn916 in escherichia coli: strategy for targeting and cloning of genes from gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the conjugative transposon tn916 (15 kilobases), originally identified in streptococcus faecalis ds16, has been cloned as an intact element on the pbr322-derived vector pgl101 in escherichia coli. the ecori f' (ecori f::tn916) fragment of pam211 (pad1::tn916) was cloned into the single ecori site of pgl101  to form the chimera, pam120, by selecting for the expression of tn916-encoded tetracycline resistance (tcr). interestingly, in the absence of continued selection for tcr, tn916 excised from pam120 at high frequency. this excision event resulted in a plasmid species consisting of the pgl101 vector and a 2.7-kilobase restriction fragment comigrating with the ecori f fragment of pad1 during agarose gel electrophoresis. filter blot hybridization experiments showed  the 2.7-kilobase fragment generated as a result of tn916 excision to be homologous with the ecori f fragment of pad1. analogous results were obtained with another chimera, pam170, generated by ligating the ecori d' (ecori d::tn916) fragment of pam210 (pad1::tn916) to ecori-digested pgl101. comparison of the alui and rsai cleavage patterns of the ecori f fragment isolated after tn916 excision  with those from an ecori f fragment derived from pad1 failed to detect any difference in the two fragments: data in support of a precise tn916 excision event in e. coli. subcloning experiments showed that an intact transposon was required for tn916 excision and located the tcr determinant near the single hindiii site on tn916. although excision occurred with high frequency in e. coli, tn916 insertion into the e. coli chromosome was a much rarer event. tcr transformants were not obtained when pam120 dna was used to transform a pola1 strain, e. coli c2368.

TI  == effect of media and blood on the antimicrobial activity of cephalosporins on serogroup d streptococci: a review.
AB  == the influence of culture medium on in vitro of selected cephalosporins on on group d streptococci was investigated by agar diffusion and broth dilution methods. the activity of cephalothin, cefamandole, and cefoperazone were not substantially influenced by the type of culture medium used, but cefuroxime, ceftizoxime, cefotaxime (ctx), cefmenoxime, and ceftriaxone varied markedly with  both the commercial brand and the blood content of the broth used. the differences were more likely to occur in some mueller-hinton media, particularly  when supplemented with 5% lysed sheep blood, and resulted in susceptible results  instead of the resistant results that were obtained with these same media without blood. some strains of streptococcus faecalis showed these discrepancies, but s.  bovis did not. the influence of the media on in vitro activity suggests a complex interaction between some cephalosporins, media components, and organisms. the cephalosporins that were affected by media share an identical moiety at the 7-acyl position (cefuroxime is slightly different); this structure is not shared  by those cephalosporins that were not affected, however. it is possible that this structure may play a part in the phenomenon.

TI  == emergence of streptococcus faecalis isolates with high-level resistance to multiple aminocyclitol aminoglycosides.
AB  == isolates of streptococcus faecalis were occasionally found to be resistant to gentamicin concentrations of 500 micrograms/ml in a microdilution tray. additional tests were performed with 28 such isolates. they all demonstrated high-level resistance (minimum inhibitory concentration greater than 2000 micrograms/ml) to gentamicin, kanamycin, sisomicin, streptomycin, and tobramycin. this high-level aminoglycoside resistance was associated with total resistance to in vitro synergism when each aminoglycoside was combined with ampicillin. in addition to ampicillin-aminoglycoside combinations, ampicillin-vancomycin, ampicillin-rifampin, rifampin-vancomycin, and vancomycin-gentamicin combinations  were also tested; all failed to exhibit an in vitro synergistic-bactericidal effect against these enterococci. the emergence of enterococci with high-level resistance to multiple aminoglycosides in this clinical population is a source of grave concern with obvious therapeutic implications in situations such as endocarditis, where an in vitro bactericidal effect is thought to be necessary for a cure. no drug or combination of drugs was found to be bactericidal for these isolates. it is suspected that similar isolates of group d streptococci with high-level resistance to gentamicin may emerge in other institutions but go  unrecognized. surveillance by others for identifying this newly emerging pathogen carrying multiple resistance and a continued search for a satisfactory chemotherapeutic agent(s) are encouraged.

TI  == genetic analysis of the pad1 pheromone response in streptococcus faecalis, using  transposon tn917 as an insertional mutagen.
AB  == the conjugative plasmid pad1 (56.7 kilobases) in streptococcus faecalis has been  shown to confer a mating response to the sex pheromone cad1 excreted by recipient strains. the response is characterized by the synthesis of a proteinaceous adhesin which coats the surface of the pad1 -containing donor cell and facilitates the formation of mating aggregates. donors exposed to cad1 -containing filtrates of recipients undergo self-aggregation (clumping), an event believed to be associated with an interaction between the adhesin and a binding substance always present on the surface of both recipients and donors. to analyze the molecular processes involved in the mating response, mutants were generated by the erythromycin resistance transposon tn917 . transpositions to pad1 in s. faecalis ds16 gave rise to a number of derivatives that exhibited "constitutive clumping" and the ability to transfer at high frequencies in short (10-min) matings. these mutants fell into two subclasses, which exhibited colony morphologies that were "dry" or "normal". the tn917 insertions were mapped by restriction enzyme analysis to two separate clusters, designated traa and trab. the dry colony subclass corresponded to traa and represented a span of 1.5 kilobases, whereas the normal subclass corresponded to trab and spanned 1.3 kilobases. the two clusters were separated by 1.7 kilobases in which insertions of tn917 did not affect the ability to respond normally to cad1 . neither type of constitutive clumper produced cad1 . another series of insertions exhibited reduced donor potential. in two cases, the reduction in transfer was three to four orders of magnitude; these mapped in traa . in two other cases, the reduction was one to two orders of magnitude. these mapped outside of traa and trab, and one was associated with an increase in plasmid copy number.

TI  == amplification of the streptococcus faecalis proton-translocating atpase by a decrease in cytoplasmic ph.
AB  == when streptococcus faecalis was grown in the presence of protonophores , an atpase activity of the membrane was increased at a ph below 8.0 but not at a ph above 8.0. characteristics of this increased atpase were identical to those of a  proton-translocating atpase (h+-atpase) located on the membrane of normal cells.  the cytoplasmic ph was regulated at 7.6 to 7.8 but was not regulated in the presence of protonophores . the increase in the h+-atpase was observed when the cytoplasmic ph was lowered to less than 7.6 by the addition of protonophores and  was not related to the dissipation of the proton motive force. thus, we suggest that the h+-atpase of the membrane is amplified when the cytoplasmic ph is lowered below the ph at which it is regulated under normal conditions.

TI  == sodium-stimulated atpase in streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == we measured na+-stimulated atpase activity in a mutant of streptococcus faecalis  defective in the generation of proton motive force. the activity in membrane vesicles was 62.1 +/- 5.9 nmol of phosphate produced per min per mg of protein when cells were grown on medium containing 0.12 m na+. activity decreased as the  concentration of na+ in the growth medium decreased. the decrease in enzyme activity corresponded to the decrease in transport activity for na+ in both whole cells and membrane vesicles. the effects of ph on both activities were identical. thus, it is suggested that na+ movement is mediated by this enzyme. sodium extrusion and atpase activity in the wild-type strain were markedly lower than those observed in the mutant strain. elevated activities of both na+ extrusion and na+-stimulated atpase could be detected in the wild-type strain when cells were grown in the absence of proton motive force. thus, we propose that the level of atpase is increased by dissipation of the proton motive force.

TI  == control of wall band splitting in streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == computer reconstructions of 659 and 1325 whole mounted, shadowed cells, randomly  chosen from cultures of streptococcus faecalis undergoing balanced growth and doubling in mass every 83 min and 30 min, respectively, were used to analyse the  cell cycle. the size limits and duration of phases of the cell cycle were estimated by applying a method previously described by the authors, details of which are given here to allow others to use the method. deeply constricted cells  whose primary septal radius, rs, was less than or equal to 0.18 micron were considered as belonging to an e-phase ending the cell cycle. the statistical parameters of these e-phase cells were used to calculate the mean and coefficient of variation of dividing cells. these latter values, in turn, predicted the moments of the total population well enough so that the method's assumptions were judged adequately satisfied. therefore, the method was considered applicable to other phases and sub-phases of the cell cycle of these two cultures. the e-phase  cells were further classified as having either 0, 1 or 2 secondary growth zones,  allowing us to calculate the percentage of newborn cells without growth zones. in the slow-growing cells, 69% of the cells arose with no growth zone. on the other  hand, in more rapidly growing cells 16% of the cells or less arose with no growth zone. our calculations showed that they could exist without a growth zone for only 2 and 0.1 min, respectively. we also classified cells as possessing a 'birth site' if the volume between the two daughter bands was greater than 0, but less than 0.06 micron3. from the statistical properties of such cells with new growth  zones, the mean pole time, w, was estimated. we also estimated w from the size of cells in e-phase. the major conclusion is that the pole time is only slightly greater than the mass doubling time at both growth rates. since dna synthesis in  s. faecalis takes longer (c = 50 to 52 min) than the mass doubling time in rich medium (30 min), a new round of chromosome replication must be initiated before the old round of synthesis is completed (dichotomous replication). consequently,  wall band splitting and initiation of chromosome replication do not occur simultaneously. it was also concluded that the cell initiates wall band splitting, resulting in pole formation and cell division, when the growth zones cannot function rapidly enough to allow the increase of surface area required to  accommodate continuing production of cytoplasm.

TI  == streptococcus faecalis proton gradients and tetracycline transport.
AB  == the transport of chlortetracycline by streptococcus faecalis is energy dependent. addition of glucose to energy-depleted cells enhances both the transport rates and accumulation levels. transport rates can be altered independently of glucose  by treating cells with ionophores that increase or decrease the proton gradient.  the transport of the antibiotic is linked only to the transmembrane ph difference, delta ph, and not the transmembrane electrical potential, delta psi.  this conclusion was verified by quantitative measurements of delta ph, delta psi, and tetracycline accumulation levels. a linear correlation between delta ph and the tetracycline electrochemical potential was observed. tetracycline most likely accumulates by the symport of protons in which the protons are bound to an anionic form of the antibiotic to form an uncharged molecule.

(j. c. perez-diaz, m. f. vicente, and f. banquero, plasmid 8:112-118, 1982). of 29 l. monocytogenes strains screened, 7 contained plasmid dna. four strains had similar if not identical plasmids that were 34 megadaltons in size, whereas three other strains contained either a 53-, 44-, or 32-megadalton plasmid; none of these plasmids has the same restriction patterns as pryc16. dna homology experiments indicate that the various plasmids are related and suggest that there may be a common set of sequences present in all of the plasmids examined.

AB  == the activity of teichomycin a2 was compared with that of vancomycin in vitro against clinical isolates of staphylococci and enterococci. teichomycin a2 was more active than vancomycin active against all isolates tested. synergistic studies also demonstrated that teichomycin a2 combined with rifampin is more active than vancomycin combined with rifampin against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis isolates. teichomycin a2, either singly or in combination with an aminoglycoside, was more active against streptococcus faecalis isolates.

TI  == echocardiographic features of bioprosthetic valve endocarditis.
AB  == abnormal echocardiographic findings in seven cases of bioprosthetic valve endocarditis were confirmed in six at operation. the echocardiograms showed three cases with thickening and increased echo intensity (group 1) and four (group 2) in which vegetations were seen initially without either of the two features in group 1. two patients in group 1 had vegetations, the causative organism being a  streptococcus. staphylococcus epidermidis was the causative organism in three of  the four cases in group 2; in two of these rapidly growing vegetations were detected. the large vegetations obstructed the ostium of the bioprosthetic valve. thus if vegetations are detected in cases in which staphylococci are the causative bacteria surgery should be performed as soon as possible. in patients who develop a fever after bioprosthetic valve replacement and especially in those with evident bacteraemia echocardiography should be repeated frequently so that lesions may be detected early.

AB  == a mixture of amphoteric surfactants with antimicrobial properties, c31g, was evaluated as a teat dip by a modified excised teat model. the model was modified  to avoid misinterpretation of results from indigenous bacterial microflora on teats. in three experiments, bacterial numbers recovered from teats dipped in .75, 1.5, and 3.0% solutions of c31g were compared with bacteria recovered from undipped teats (negative controls) and teats dipped with 1.0% iodophor (an effective teat dip). mean log reductions of teat end concentrations of staphylococcus, aureus, streptococcus fecalis, and escherichia coli were determined in each experiment. efficacy was greatest for the 3.0% solution of c31g with mean log reductions (log reduction = log 10 of controls - log 10 of dipped teats) 3.53 for staphylococcus aureus, 2.89 for streptococcus fecalis, and 3.16 for escherichia coli. iodophor (1%) yielded mean log reductions of 3.26 for  staphylococcus aureus, 2.16 for streptococcus fecalis, and 2.83 for escherichia coli. for all three organisms, number of viable organisms decreased with increasing concentrations of c31g. the efficacy of c31g should be evaluated in vivo.

TI  == rutin-induced beta-glucosidase activity in streptococcus faecium vgh-1 and streptococcus sp. strain frp-17 isolated from human feces: formation of the mutagen, quercetin, from rutin.
AB  == a fecal isolate, streptococcus sp. strain frp-17, and strain vgh-1 of streptococcus faecium were shown to contain beta-glucosidases which converted rutin (quercetin-3-o-beta-d-glucose-alpha-l-rhamnose) to quercetin and were active against o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-glucose. the activity against rutin could be  measured by increased mutagenicity in the ames assay or visualized on thin-layer  chromatography plates. in both organisms, the beta-glucosidase activities were inducible by the addition of rutin to the growth media. several closely related strains of streptococcus spp. lacked any beta-glucosidase activity. in cell preparations of the active organisms, activities with rutin and o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-glucose were optimal at ph 6.8 and could be enhanced by increasing the ionic strength of the assay system. at low ionic strengths, both quercetin and a new product (intermediate between the polarities of rutin and quercetin) were formed by the incubation of rutin with cell preparations of either active organism. this product disappeared with increased ionic strength, suggesting that it may be a reaction intermediate, quercetin-3-o-beta-d-glucose.  these results suggest that the beta-glucosidase active against rutin and that active against o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-glucose are the same.

AB  == plasmid pam beta 1, originally isolated from streptococcus faecalis ds5, mediates resistance to the mls (macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin b alpha) group of antibiotics. a restriction endonuclease map of the 26.5-kilobase (kb) pam beta 1 molecule was constructed by using the enzymes avai, hpaii, ecori, pvuii, kpn1,  bsteii, hpai, hhai, and hindiii. a comparison of this map to those of four independently isolated deletion derivatives of pam beta 1 located the mls resistance determinant within a 2-kb dna segment and at least one conjugative function within an 8-kb region. the 5.0-kb ecori-b fragment from pam beta 1 was ligated onto the 4.0-kb escherichia coli plasmid vector, packc1, and used to transform e. coli hb101. the 9.0-kb chimeric plasmid was then used to transform streptococcus sanguis challis with concurrent expression of the e. coli kanamycin resistance determinant. the 5.0-kb ecori-b fragment from pam beta 1 was subsequently used as a vector to clone a streptomycin resistance determinant from a strain of streptococcus mutans containing no detectable plasmid dna. subcloning experiments, using a hindiii partial digest of pam beta 1 dna, narrowed the replication region of this plasmid to a 2.95-kb fragment.

TI  == the effects of heparin on the adherence of five species of urinary tract pathogens to urinary bladder mucosa.
AB  == previous studies performed in our laboratory have indicated that the primary antibacterial defense mechanism of the rabbit urinary bladder is the antiadsorptive action of the surface mucopolysaccharide. removal of this layer with an acid rinse increases bacterial adherence up to 100 fold. exogenous mucopolysaccharide (heparin) has been shown to restore escherichia coli adherence to control levels. to determine whether this antiadherence action of heparin is species specific, we compared the adherence of 5 common urinary tract pathogens (escherichia coli, klebsiella ozonae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  and streptococcus fecalis) to both mucin intact and mucin deficient rabbit bladders with and without prior heparin exposure. bacteria were radiolabeled by addition of 3h-adenine to the culture broth so that the number of bacteria adhering to the bladder could be determined using liquid scintillation spectrophotometry. results were as follows: acid removal of the mucin layer significantly increased the adherence approximately 10 fold for all 5 species tested. briefly exposing the mucin deficient bladders to heparin decreased the adherence of all species tested except pseudomonas to mucin intact control levels. heparin treatment of mucin intact bladders slightly decreased adherence of all species except pseudomonas below mucin intact controls, however, results were not statistically significant. the magnitude of klebsiella adherence was nearly 20 fold greater than all other species tested. while this non-species specific adherence inhibition of heparin may prove useful in the clinical setting, it appears to be less effective against pseudomonas.

AB  == penicillin-binding protein (pbp) 5 of streptococcus faecium atcc 9790 has an unusually low affinity for penicillin (50% binding occurred at a penicillin level of 8 micrograms/ml after 60 min of incubation, and the protein only became labeled after 20 min of incubation with high concentrations of radioactive penicillin). pbps with similar properties are carried by strains of streptococcus durans, streptococcus faecalis, and streptococcus lactis but not by strains of groups a, b, c, and g streptococci or streptococcus pneumoniae. the strains carrying the slow-reacting pbp demonstrated a sensitivity to penicillin that was  several hundred times lower than that of strains not carrying it. spontaneous mutants with minimal inhibitory concentrations of penicillin of 20, 40, and 80 micrograms/ml were isolated from s. faecium atcc 9790. they all showed a dramatic increase in the amount of slow-reacting pbp produced. mutants with increased penicillin resistance were also isolated from wild-type strains of s. durans, s.  faecalis, and s. faecium. all of them carried a greater amount of the slow-reacting pbp than that carried by the parent. finally, it was found that resistant s. faecium atcc 9790 mutants grew normally in the presence of penicillin concentrations that were far above that saturating all pbps except pbp 5. cell growth was, on the contrary, inhibited by a penicillin concentration that saturated the slow-reacting pbp by 90%. this penicillin dose was equal to the minimal inhibitory concentration.

TI  == nucleotide sequence of the streptococcus faecalis plasmid gene encoding the 3'5"-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase type iii.
AB  == we have cloned in escherichia coli and sequenced a 1489-bp dna fragment conferring resistance to kanamycin and originating from the streptococcal plasmid pjh1. the resistance gene was located by analysis of the initiation and termination codons in an open reading frame (orf) of 792 bp. the deduced gene product, a 3'5''-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase of type iii, has an mr of 29,200. comparison of its amino acid sequence with those of type i (oka et al., 1981) and type ii (beck et al., 1982) 3' phosphotransferase, from transposable elements tn903 and tn5, respectively, indicated a statistically significant structural relationship between these enzymes from phylogenetically remote bacterial genera. the degree of homology observed indicate that phosphotransferase type iii and type i genes have diverged from a common ancestor and that the phosphotransferase type ii gene has emerged more recently from the type i evolutionary pathway.

TI  == genetic, molecular, and functional analysis of streptococcus faecalis r plasmid pjh1.
AB  == streptococcus faecalis jh1 contains two conjugative plasmids, pjh1, an r plasmid  that codes for resistance to kanamycin, streptomycin, erythromycin, and tetracycline, and pjh2, a hemolysin-bacteriocin plasmid. strain jh1 was used as an antibiotic resistance donor in conjugation experiments with two plasmid-free s. faecalis recipient strains, jh2-2 and og1-rf1. plasmid pjh1 was purified from  one transconjugant, dl77, and subjected to restriction endonuclease analyses. five restriction enzymes, ecori, xbai, bamhi, sali, and xhoi, yielding 10, 9, 3,  2, and 2 fragments, respectively, were used to determine the size (80.7 kilobases) of pjh1 and to construct a restriction endonuclease map of the plasmid. twenty-eight percent of the antibiotic-resistant transconjugants examined expressed only part of the resistance pattern (kmr smr emr tcr) associated with pjh1, that is, they were resistant to kanamycin, streptomycin, and erythromycin; to erythromycin and tetracycline; or to erythromycin or to tetracycline only. most of these strains also produced hemolysin and bacteriocin, and several contained a hybrid plasmid consisting of pjh2 and specific segments of pjh1 dna. several of these hybrid plasmids, as well as a deletion derivative of pjh1 that coded for resistance to tetracycline but not to kanamycin, streptomycin, or erythromycin, were purified and used to confirm the arrangement  of restriction endonuclease fragments on the pjh1 map and to locate the resistance determinants on this map.

TI  == folate analogues. 22. synthesis and biological evaluation of two analogues of dihydrofolic acid possessing a 7,8-dihydro-8-oxapterin ring system.
AB  == two analogues of dihydrofolic acid possessing a 7,8-dihydro-8-oxapterin ring system have been synthesized and evaluated for their antifolate activities. these compounds, n-[(2-amino-4-hydroxy-7,8-dihydro-8-oxa-6-pteridinyl)benzoyl]-l-glutamic acid (3) and n-[[(2-amino-4-hydroxy-7,8-dihydro-8-oxa-6-pteridinyl) methyl]benzoyl]-l-glutamic acid (4), were synthesized by reacting the appropriately substituted alpha-halo ketones with 2,5-diamino-4,6-dihydroxypyrimidine (2). elaboration of p-carbomethoxybenzaldehyde (5) to p-carbomethoxyphenacyl bromide (7) was accomplished by its oxidation with jones reagent and the successive treatment of  the oxidation product with socl2, ch2n2, and hbr. commercially available p-vinylbenzoic acid (11) was converted to its glutamate conjugate 12 and was further converted to the bromo ketone, diethyl n-[p-(1-bromo-2-oxopropyl)benzoyl]-l-glutamate (17), by a series of reactions involving epoxidation, oxirane ring opening with hbr, jones oxidation, zn/hoac reduction, and successive treatment of the reduction product 16 with socl2, ch2n2, and hbr. these bromo ketones, 7 and 17, upon reaction with pyrimidine 2, gave the diethyl esters of the target compounds, which were hydrolyzed to 3 and 4 with naoh. compound 4 underwent an interesting acid-catalyzed isomerization where the double bond of 4 was shifted from the 5,6-position to the 6,9-position to give the isomer 19. both compounds 3 and 4 were inactive against lactobacillus casei (atcc 7469) and did not serve as synthetic substrates of l. casei dihydrofolate reductase. compound 4 showed activity against streptococcus faecium (atcc 8043), but 3 was inactive against this organism.

TI  == streptococcus plasmid pam alpha 1 is a composite of two separable replicons, one  of which is closely related to bacillus plasmid pbc16.
AB  == a tetracycline resistance plasmid of streptococcus faecalis, pam alpha 1, is shown to contain two independent sets of replication functions, separated from each other on either side by short (300- to 400-base-pair) sequences of homology. the homologous sequences are oriented as direct repeats and therefore permit the  dissociation of pam alpha 1 into its component replicons, referred to here as pam alpha 1 delta 1 and pam alpha 1 delta 2, as the reciprocal products of a simple intramolecular recombination. pam alpha 1 delta 1 is a 4.6-kilobase plasmid which carries the tet gene, and pam alpha 1 delta 2 is a 5.1-kilobase plasmid which carries no known selectable marker. pam alpha 1 delta 1 is shown to replicate efficiently in bacillus subtilis and to confer tetracycline resistance on bacillus hosts. we demonstrate by restriction mapping analysis that pam alpha 1 delta 1 is virtually identical to a 4.6-kilobase tetracycline resistance plasmid  of bacillus cereus, pbc16, which is known to show extensive homology to plasmid isolates from staphylococcus species (such as pub110), as well as from other bacillus species. the pam alpha 1 delta 1-pbc16-pub110 replicon thus exists naturally in at least three different gram-positive genera, indicating that these plasmids have a high degree of interspecific functional adaptability and supporting the view that plasmid dna is commonly exchanged among many species of  gram-positive bacteria in their natural environments.

TI  == therapeutic potential of rifampin in enterococcal infections.
AB  == rifampin is active against enterococci in vitro; virtually all clinical isolates  are inhibited by concentrations of less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. however, rifampin is bacteriostatic, not bactericidal, and resistance emerges rapidly when the drug is employed alone against enterococci in vitro. the combination of rifampin with beta-lactam drugs, aminoglycosides, or vancomycin generally gives indifferent results. limited data from studies done in vivo are contradictory and do not document unequivocally that rifampin is strikingly active, even in combination with other agents, against enterococcal infections. whether rifampin will ever play a role in therapy for enterococcal infections in  humans remains to be determined.

AB  == the in-vitro activity of cefathiamidine against streptococcus faecalis and str. faecium were studied in comparison with other beta-lactams. all the 56 strains of str. faecalis tested were inhibited by 2 mg/l of cefathiamidine. mics of ampicillin were twofold higher than those of cefathiamidine and mics of cephaloridine and cephazolin were 8-16-fold higher. no significant inoculum effect on mics of cefathiamidine could be seen. two isolates of str. faecium showed resistance to the four antibiotics. the mbcs of cefathiamidine and ampicillin for ten strains of str. faecalis showed that the ratios of mbc/mic were greater than 64. the rates of killing of str. faecalis were reduced at concentrations of cefathiamidine and ampicillin greater than the mic. the most rapid killing was obtained at 2 mg/l cefathiamidine or 4 mg/l of ampicillin. with the addition of 1 mg/l gentamicin this paradoxical bacteriocidal effect was eliminated. time killing studies showed 99.9% of the cells were killed within 6 h by a combination of aminoglycoside and beta-lactam. the paradoxical bacteriocidal effect of cefathiamidine and ampicillin was also demonstrated on solid media.

AB  == cross-linked poly(vinylpyridinium halide) was found to have a novel and remarkable ability to remove bacteria from water. for example, when 10 g (wet weight) of cross-linked poly(n-benzyl-4-vinylpyridinium bromide) was contacted with 20 ml of suspensions of escherichia coli (9.7 x 10(4) to 9.7 x 10(7)/ml), salmonella typhimurium (8.0 x 10(6) to 1.1 x 10(7)/ml), streptococcus faecalis (5.0 x 10(7)/ml), staphylococcus aureus (8.1 x 10(7)/ml), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.2 x 10(5)/ml) under stirring in sterilized physiological saline at  37 degrees c, 99% of the viable cells of these bacteria were removed in 2 to 6 h. when suspensions of these bacteria (10(5) to 10(8) cells per ml) were passed through a column (20 mm by 100 cm) of cross-linked poly(n-benzyl-4-vinylpyridinium bromide) at 37 degrees c with a flow rate of 0.8  to 1.4 bed volumes per h, 97 to 100% of the viable cells were eliminated from the suspensions during the treatment. mechanistic studies demonstrated that cross-linked poly(vinylpyridinium halide) irreversibly captured these bacteria alive during the treatment. that is, total organic carbon was removed during the  treatment, and the bacteria which adhered to the resin proliferated on the bacterial medium. the adhesion capacity was estimated to be 10(10) cells per g (dry weight). total organic carbon was also removed even when the bacteria were killed by heat treatment before the column studies.

TI  == rat arthritis due to whole group b streptococci. clinical and histopathologic features compared with groups a and d.
AB  == heat-killed streptococci of groups a, b, and d injected intraperitoneally into sprague-dawley rats induced arthritis. the histopathologic features of the arthritis were those of erosive synovitis. early acute lesions were associated with deposits of streptococcal antigens. the serogroups and the physical state of the streptococci determined the incidence, the time of onset, the duration, and the severity of the disease, the severity being a blend of degree of inflammation, tendency to relapse, and occurrence of ankylosis. whole group a usually failed to induce arthritis. group a disrupted with sonication regularly induced arthritis after a 24-hour latent period. the disease lasted over 60 days  and caused ankylosis. whole group b regularly induced arthritis but only after a  latent period of 6-8 days. the disease lasted over 40 days and caused ankylosed joints. with sonicated group b a similar disease was induced, except that, as with sonicated group a, the latent period was 24 hours. whole group d induced disease after a latent period of 48 hours. the arthritis lasted only 2 weeks and  was transient. in contrast to its effects on group a and b cocci, sonication of group d abrogated its capacity to induce arthritis. it is postulated that for whole streptococci, in contrast to sonicated streptococci, arthritogenicity depends on the sensitivity of the cocci to initial processing in vivo. processing may be partial digestion by enzymes of phagocytes. cocci such as those of group a that are insensitive to processing, injected whole, tend not to cause arthritis,  but when they do cause disease, it is chronic. a coccus, such as one of group d,  that is very sensitive to processing produces a transient arthritis after a short latent period, while a coccus of intermediate sensitivity, such as one of group b, induces disease only after a substantial latent period, and the disease is severe and chronic. the nature of processing remains to be determined.

TI  == purification of a putative k+-atpase from streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == we have purified a novel membrane atpase from streptococcus faecalis by the following procedure: extraction of membranes with triton x-100 followed by fractionation of the extract by successive deae-cellulose chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography and cm-sepharose chromatography. the overall yield was 5%. the purified atpase appears to consist of a single polypeptide component  of mr = 78,000. the triton-solubilized purified enzyme has a specific activity of approximately 50 mumol of atp hydrolyzed per min per mg, is dependent on phospholipids for activity, and is strongly inhibited by vanadate (i50 = 3 microm). maximal atpase activity is displayed at ph 7.3. mg2+-atp, for which the  enzyme has a km of 60 microm, is the best substrate. the atpase forms an acylphosphate intermediate that can also be detected in native membranes as the major acylphosphate component. the purified atpase, when reconstituted into soybean phospholipid vesicles, exhibits coupling, e.g. the atpase activity can be stimulated at least 8-fold by valinomycin in the presence of potassium. based on  these observations we conclude that the enzyme we have purified is an ion-motive  atpase, most likely a k+-atpase.

TI  == streptococcal r plasmid pip501: endonuclease site map, resistance determinant location, and construction of novel derivatives.
AB  == the streptococcal resistance plasmid pip501 (30 kilobase pairs [kb]) encodes resistance to chloramphenicol (cmr) and erythromycin (emr) and is capable of conjugative transfer among numerous streptococcal species. by using a streptococcal host-vector recombinant dna system, the cmr and emr determinants of pip501 were localized to 6.3-kb hindiii and 2.1-kb hindiii-avai fragments, respectively. pip501 was lost at a frequency of 22% in streptococcus sanguis cells grown at 42 degrees c but was stable in cells grown at 37 degrees c (less than 1% frequency of loss). sequences from a cryptic multicopy plasmid, pva380-1, were substituted for the pip501 emr determinant in vitro, and the resulting recombinant plasmid, designated pva797, was recovered in transformed s. sanguis cells. the replication of pva797 was governed by the pva380-1 sequences based on  temperature-stable replication and incompatibility with pva380-1-derived replicons. the self-ligation of partially cleaved hindiii pip501 dna fragments allowed the localization of a pip501 region involved in autonomous plasmid replication. a small pip501 derivative (pva798) obtained from this experiment had a greatly increased copy number but was unstably inherited. our data indicate that the sequences encoding the resistance determinants and some of the plasmid replication machinery are relatively clustered on the pip501 molecule. the properties of pva797 and pva798 indicate that these molecules will enhance current streptococcal genetic systems from the standpoint of conjugative mobilization (pva797) and gene amplification (pva798).

AB  == a new method for the quantitative determination of low proteinase activities in culture filtrates or other complex protein-containing substrates has been developed. the method is based on the inactivation of streptokinase which is monitored by following the reduction of fibrinolysis. in a time interval ranging  from 1 to 500 min, the half-life of streptokinase activity is directly proportional to proteinase concentration. the enzymatic reactions are not interfered with by either other proteins or coloured substances.

TI  == plasmid content of streptococcus faecalis strain 39-5 and identification of a pheromone (cpd1)-induced surface antigen.
AB  == streptococcus faecalis 39-5 is a haemolytic, bacteriocinogenic strain harbouring  six plasmids. one of these plasmids, ppd1 (36.4 mdal) determines a bacteriocin and encodes a conjugative response to the sex pheromone cpd1 excreted by recipient (plasmid-free) strains. the pheromone response is characterized by the  formation of mating aggregates of donors (responders) with recipients. aggregation required the presence of phosphate and divalent cations and was inhibited by agents or conditions that destroy protein structure. aggregation was postulated to be due to synthesis of a new proteinaceous molecule on the donor cell surface. referred to as 'aggregation substance', such a material was identified and found to exhibit antigenic properties not associated with uninduced cells; it could be detected by immunoelectron microscopy. aggregation substance could be extracted from induced cells but not uninduced cells as demonstrated by crossed immunoelectrophoresis. antibody raised against the aggregation substance controlled by ppd1 cross-reacted with aggregation substance determined by other plasmid systems which respond to pheromones unrelated to cpd1.

TI  == simple additives to increase the activity of chlorhexidine digluconate against urinary pathogens.
AB  == the concentration of chlorhexidine digluconate required to kill gram-negative bacteria which cause urinary tract infection associated with urethral catheterisation also damages the bladder mucosa. increased bactericidal activity  was obtained by the addition of a chelating agent (edta) and a buffer (tris) enabling a low concentration of chlorhexidine (0.01 per cent) to be effective against escherichia coli nctc 86, pseudomonas aeruginosa nctc 7650 proteus mirabilis nctc 8309 and streptococcus faecalis nctc 8213. the type of fluid in which the bacteria were suspended affected the time required to achieve 99.9 per  cent killing. the 0.01 per cent chlorhexidine solution with added edta and tris did not cause severe erosive damage to the bladder mucosa of rats. the potential  of this solution for use as a skin antiseptic prior to catheterisation and as a bladder instillation after catheterisation is discussed.

AB  == the streptococcus faecalis transposon tn917 was introduced into bacillus subtilis by transformation of competent cells with the plasmid pam alpha 1::tn917 and was  tested for transposition activity by selection for insertions into the temperate  phage sp beta. insertions were obtained at a frequency indicating relatively efficient movement of the element, and southern hybridization analysis of a particular insertion confirmed it to be the result of a genuine transposition event. a restriction fragment from pam alpha 1::tn917 containing the transposon sequences was ligated into a temperature-sensitive plasmid (pbd95), and transpositions into the b. subtilis chromosome were selected by requiring the transposon drug resistance to be maintained at temperatures nonpermissive for plasmid replication. insertions have been recovered at many chromosomal sites, including ones that produced auxotrophy of different kinds and ones that produced various different sporulation-defective phenotypes, indicating good prospects for the use of tn917 as a tool for insertional mutagenesis in b. subtilis.

TI  == studies on the mechanism of intrinsic resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in group d streptococci.
AB  == six penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) were detected in clinical isolates of each one of three group d streptococci: streptococcus bovis, s. faecalis and s. faecium. when examined in whole organisms, the pbps of s. faecium, the most penicillin-resistant species of group d streptococci, generally had lower affinities for the antibiotic than those of s. faecalis (intermediate penicillin  resistance), which in turn were of lower affinity than those of s. bovis (penicillin-sensitive). on the other hand, no quantitative correlation could be established between the binding of penicillin to any one pbp or group of pbps, and the penicillin mic value for the corresponding micro-organism. examination of the amounts of antibiotic bound and the rates of binding to pbps of equal numbers of protoplasts and whole bacteria of s. faecalis and s. faecium, indicated that there was no permeability barrier to benzylpenicillin in the cell walls of these  species. the lower antibacterial effectiveness of cephalothin compared with ampicillin in group d streptococci was paralleled by the higher concentrations of cephalothin needed in competition assays to inhibit the lower molecular size pbps of these bacteria.

AB  == immune complexes from patients with subacute endocarditis were used to develop a  methodology for characterization of the antigen involved in human circulating immune complexes. this model was chosen because it permits isolation of the causative agent of the streptococcal infection thought to contain the antigen present in the immune complex. a comparison was made between two methods for characterization of bacterial antigen bound to antibody. in the first, animals were immunized with purified immune complexes and the production of antistreptococcal antibodies was investigated. in the second method, a sandwich elisa was developed, implying the double specificity of the immune complex (human immunoglobulin and streptococcal antigen). the latter method gave the best results, detecting antigen in the immune complexes of 8 out of 10 patients' sera. the application of this method to other immunopathological situations is discussed.

AB  == we studied 19 surgical patients with 24 postoperative episodes of enterococcal septicemia not arising from the biliary or urinary tracts or from infected heart  valves. fifteen episodes occurred despite the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics; in only one patient were these drugs effective against enterococcus. there were 14 episodes of enterococcemia in 11 patients following which the patient survived for at least one week. thirteen (93%) of those episodes were treated with either ampicillin or drainage, or both. five of the six long-term survivors received ampicillin therapy. overall mortality was 68%. the data suggest that the enterococcus may emerge as a blood-borne pathogen in immunodepressed, postoperative patients receiving antibiotics for other infections of enteric origin. antibiotic therapy specifically directed against this organism (and surgical drainage, if necessary) may be indicated during polymicrobial sepsis of enteric or mixed origin. if the spectrum of antibiotics does not include enterococcus, this organism can cause "breakthrough" sepsis, as  can many other opportunistic organisms.

AB  == the substrate specificities of folylpolyglutamate synthetases from corynebacterium species, lactobacillus casei, streptococcus faecalis, and chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells are described. the purified corynebacterium enzyme catalyzes the addition of glutamate moieties to reduced pteroylmonoglutamates, and to 5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroyldi- and triglutamates. the purified protein also possesses a separate dihydrofolate synthetase activity. binding of pteroate  substrates to dihydrofolate synthetase impairs folate binding to folylpolyglutamate synthetase. the in vivo distribution of folylpolyglutamates in bacteria and mammalian cells, which differs from source to source, appears to be  a reflection of the ability of folylpolyglutamates to act as substrates for folylpolyglutamate synthetases from different sources. bacterial synthetases use  a variety of pteroylmonoglutamates as their preferred monoglutamate substrate, but use 5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroyl polyglutamates as their preferred, and sometimes only, polyglutamate substrates. mono- and polyglutamyl forms of tetrahydrofolate are the preferred substrates of the cho cell synthetase. products of one carbon metabolism do not affect the in vivo distribution of folylpolyglutamates in cho cells. although adenine changes the distribution of folylpolyglutamates in bacteria, this effect is mediated by changing the substrate availability for the synthetase reaction, and not by regulating the levels of the synthetase per se.

TI  == regulation of folylpoly-gamma-glutamate synthesis in bacteria: in vivo and in vitro synthesis of pteroylpoly-gamma-glutamates by lactobacillus casei and streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == lactobacillus casei and streptococcus faecalis accumulated labeled folic acid and metabolized this compound to poly-gamma-glutamates of chain lengths of up to 11 and 5, respectively. octa- and nonaglutamates predominated in l. casei, and tetraglutamates predominated in s. faecalis. the most effective monoglutamate substrates for the l. casei and s. faecalis folylpoly-gamma-glutamate (folylpolyglutamate) synthetases were methylene- and formyltetrahydrofolate, respectively. methylenetetrahydropteroylpoly-gamma-glutamates were the preferred  poly-gamma-glutamate substrates for both enzymes and, in each case, the highest activity was observed with the diglutamate substrate. the final distribution of folylpolyglutamates in these bacteria appeared to reflect the ability of folates  with various glutamate chain lengths to act as substrates for the bacterial folylpolyglutamate synthetases. the proportions of individual folylpolyglutamates were markedly affected by culturing the bacteria in medium containing adenine, whereas thymine was without effect. adenine did not affect the level of folylpolyglutamate synthetase in either organism but caused a large increase in the proportion of intracellular folates containing one-carbon units at the oxidation level of formate, folates which are substrates for enzymes involved in  purine biosynthesis. the folates with shorter glutamate chain lengths in bacteria cultured in the presence of adenine resulted from primary regulation of the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway, regulation which caused an accumulation of formyltetrahydropteroyl-poly-gamma-glutamates (folate derivatives that are ineffective substrates for folylpolyglutamate synthetases), and did not result from regulation of folylpolyglutamate synthetase per se.

AB  == plasmids pad1 (37.8 megadaltons) and pad2 (17.1 megadaltons) of streptococcus faecalis strain ds16 have been mapped with restriction enzymes. the location of a hemolysin-bacteriocin determinant on the conjugative pad1 plasmid was derived from analyses of transposon insertions. electron microscope and hybridization analyses located tn917(em) and the streptomycin (sm) and kanamycin (km) resistance determinants on the nonconjugative pad2 plasmid. it was shown previously that the erythromycin (em) resistance associated with tn917 is inducible and that transposition from pad2 to pad1 is also stimulated by exposure of cells to low concentrations of em. here we show that inducing concentrations of em also increase the conjugative transfer potential of pad1; this is possibly  related to a mild and short-lived inhibitory stress placed on the cells before full induction of resistance. selection of em-resistant transconjugants arising from matings between ds16 and a plasmid-free recipient gave rise to transconjugants which primarily harbor stable pad1::pad2 cointegrates. a 30-min exposure of donors to em (0.5 microgram/ml) before mating resulted in a severalfold increase in the number of such transconjugants. however, a small fraction (e.g., 3 of 40) of these emr smr kmr transconjugants harbored pad1::tn917 and pad2 molecules. since we believe pad2 is incapable of being mobilized by pad1 without being covalently linked, it is likely that transfer in  these cases involved cointegrates representing structural intermediates in the transposition of tn917 from pad2 to pad1. it follows that such intermediates probably had two copies of tn917 and readily resolved after transfer. (these cointegrates are different from the stable cointegrates which were shown to have  only a single copy of tn917; the latter are assumed not to be related to transposition.) two variants with altered tn917 transposition properties were derived. one of them transposed at an elevated frequency, whereas the other showed no detectabel transposition. in neither case was transposition influenced  by em exposure; however, both remained inducible for em resistance.

AB  == it was demonstrated that th69, an lyophylized preparation of streptococcus faecalis th001 (atcc no. 31663) induced interferon gamma (ifn gamma) in spleen cell cultures. the ifn activity was found in 8 hrs and reached to the peak of 120-240 u/ml 24-48 hrs after incubation in every concentration of 4, 20, and 100  micrograms/ml of th69. th69-induced ifn (th69-ifn) was produced by t cells assisted by macrophages which were stimulated with th69, and the activity was neutralized by 80-90% with anti-ifn gamma serum but hardly neutralized with anti-ifn alpha, beta serum. therefore, th69-ifn was found to be mostly gamma type. the elution profile of th69-ifn activity on a column with toyopearl hw-55s  showed that molecular weight of ifn was estimated at 18,000-28,000. sequential purification on this column of th69-ifn increased the specific activity to approximately 2.5 x 10(4) u/mg protein (partially purified th69-ifn: th69-ifnp).  a small amount of th69-ifnp (5-50 u/ml) augmented nk activity and induced cytotoxic macrophages in vitro. growth of meth-a tumor cells exposed to th69-ifnp of 100 u/ml in vitro declined to 50% and three times injection of th69-ifn (200 u/50 microliters) into the tumor sites of mice given implants of meth-a suppressed the tumor growth.

TI  == experimental endocarditis in rabbits. 7. results of long-term combined therapy of streptococcus faecalis endocarditis with penicillin and gentamicin.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of long-term penicillin-gentamicin treatment on experimental s. faecalis endocarditis due to selected strains; one strain was homogeneously resistant to 8000 micrograms/ml streptomycin (ic50 and mic greater than 8000 micrograms ml), the other strain heterogeneously resistant to 8000 micrograms/ml streptomycin (ic50: 3300 micrograms/ml, mic: greater than 8000 micrograms/ml. both strains showed low-grade resistance to gentamicin (mic 10.5 and 25 micrograms/ml, respectively). the results showed that there was significant effect of the treatment in rabbits  with endocarditis due to both strains, as measured by lowered mortality and by high bacteriologic cure rate. despite effective antibiotic treatment, a high incidence (57%) of congestive heart failure was noted in rabbits late in the treatment period or after termination of antibiotic treatment, probably due to healing processes on the aortic valves. in human cases of s. faecalis endocarditis the antibiotic treatment should be either penicillin plus streptomycin or penicillin plus gentamicin. however, in cases where the infecting strain is homogeneously resistant to 8000 micrograms/ml streptomycin, the treatment with penicillin plus gentamicin is clearly the drug combination of choice.

TI  == effects of growth temperature on transport and membrane viscosity in streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == a shift in the growth temperature of streptococcus faecalis from 37 to 10 degrees c resulted in an 18% increase in the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids. electron spin resonance spectra of spin-labeled membranes and extracted phospholipids indicated viscosity changes consistent with the alterations in fatty acid composition. growth temperature had no significant effect on the active transport of leucine and alanine; uptake rates assayed at 10 or 35 degrees c were essentially the same in cells grown at either 10 or 37 degrees c. the relative rapidity of amino acid transport, which presumably contributes to the ability of s. faecalis to thrive in cold environments, is evidently unrelated to  adaptive changes in the viscosity of membrane lipids.

TI  == identification of bacterial antigens in circulating immune complexes of infective endocarditis.
AB  == the presence of circulating immune complexes (ic) in patients with infective endocarditis has been well documented but the contributions of host and bacterial components to these ic have not been defined. to study this question, ic were isolated from serum of a patient with streptococcus faecalis endocarditis by differential polyethylene glycol precipitation and competitive binding to staphylococcal protein a. a rabbit antiserum raised against the purified ic had reactivity by crossed immunoelectrophoresis primarily with an antigen derived from the cytoplasm of the infective organism. the antigen was a protein with a 12,000-dalton molecular mass. in situ radiolabeling of the ic bound to the protein a demonstrated a component of the same molecular mass as the bacterial antigen recognized by the antiserum. the patient serum had multiple antibody specificities reactive with bacterial antigens, including the antigen recognized  by the rabbit anti-ic antiserum. these techniques for isolation and characterization of circulating ic may have value in the study of ic diseases in  which the inciting antigens are not known.

TI  == genetic and physiological analysis of conjugation in streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == in an effort to elucidate the mechanisms of conjugal plasmid transfer in streptococcus faecalis, a genetic analysis of the sex pheromone-dependent tetracycline resistance plasmid pcf-10 was initiated. rare transconjugants obtained from short matings with wild-type donors not exposed to sex pheromones were screened for increased donor potential in a subsequent mating. from this screening, a mutant plasmid, designated pcf-11, whose transfer functions are expressed in the absence of pheromone induction was isolated. cells carrying pcf-11 spontaneously clump when grown in broth culture but do not excrete sex pheromones active against wild-type donors. in the course of initial experiments, it was observed that physiological conditions could affect plasmid transfer frequency. therefore, a set of standardized optimal mating conditions was defined. the experiments carried out to determine these conditions revealed that  a transient increase in transfer frequency of about 2 order of magnitude occurred in early-exponential-phase donor cells. this peak of activity is independent of sex pheromone response, since it was observed with induced or uninduced donor cells carrying either pcf-11 or pcf-10.

AB  == it is evident at this time that enterococci by themselves are able to cause infections outside the bloodstream and the urinary tract only rarely and under very special circumstances in which local defense mechanisms are severely compromised (e.g., by plastic devices). in most instances, they have been found in mixed culture and probably act synergistically with other bacteria to cause damage to the host. they could, however, be carried from their habitat into the bloodstream and eventually cause septicemia. such a danger is probably heightened if supercolonization is fostered through antibiotics that are ineffective against them, e.g., cephalosporins.

AB  == streptococcus faecalis var. zymogenes was grown aerobically and anaerobically in  the presence and absence of haematin, with glycerol as the carbon and energy source. aerobic growth was stimulated by the inclusion of haematin in the medium  but fumarate had no effect on growth. the bacterium was unable to grow anaerobically on glycerol unless fumarate was present; haematin had no effect on  growth. nadh oxidase activity, which catalysed the oxidation of nadh + h+ to form h2o rather than h2o2, was found in the soluble fraction and was induced by aerobic growth but partially repressed when haematin was present in the medium. in contrast, a particulate nadh oxidase, which was sensitive to inhibition by antimycin a and 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline n-oxide, was induced by aerobic growth in the presence of haematin. nadh peroxidase was massively induced by aerobic growth, whereas more lactate dehydrogenase activity was found in anaerobically grown bacteria. catalase was formed only during aerobic growth in the presence of haematin.

TI  == comparison of recovery of organisms from blood cultures diluted 10% (volume/volume) and 20% (volume/volume).
AB  == we compared blood cultures that were diluted 1:5 (20%, vol/vol) and 1:10 (10%, vol/vol) and contained specimens from patients with suspected septicemia. streptococcus pneumoniae was recovered significantly more frequently from blood cultures diluted 20%, whereas gram-negative bacilli, group d streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, and candida spp. were recovered significantly sooner and more frequently from blood cultures diluted 10%. statistically significant differences in isolation rates, however, represented only a small number of patients for whom the positive cultures affected therapy. we conclude that as long as at least two separate sets of blood cultures are obtained per septic episode from each patient, a 1:5 to 1:10 blood/vented (aerobic) medium ratio provides acceptable results. nevertheless, the results also demonstrate that blood cultures diluted 10% provided greater and faster yields than those provided by blood cultures diluted 20%.

TI  == characterization of two tetracycline resistance determinants in streptococcus faecalis jh1.
AB  == streptococcus faecalis strain jh1 harbors two conjugative plasmids: pjh1, an r plasmid mediating resistance to kanamycin, streptomycin, gentamicin, erythromycin, and tetracycline, and pjh2, a hemolysin-bacteriocin plasmid. studies of plasmid-cured derivatives of strain jh1 and of transconjugates obtained after mixed incubation of jh1 with the plasmid-free s. faecalis strain jh2-2 revealed the presence of two tetracycline resistance determinants in strain jh1. one determinant mediated constitutive resistance to 40 micrograms of tetracycline per ml and was associated with plasmid pjh1. the second determinant, either on the chromosome of strain jh1 or on an undetectable plasmid, was inducible by tetracycline and enabled the host strain, in the absence of pjh1, to grow in the presence of 80 micrograms of tetracycline per ml. one transconjugant, strain dl172, was resistant to 80 micrograms of tetracycline per ml, sensitive to kanamycin, streptomycin, and erythromycin, and hemolytic in the presence, but not in the absence, of tetracycline. a single plasmid, pdl172, from this strain consisted of plasmid pjh2 and a 17.8-kilobase segment of dna homologous to total  cell dna from strain jh1 but did not contain plasmid pjh1. whether the addition of heterologous dna to plasmid pjh2 occurred by translocation of a 17.8-kilobase  tetracycline resistance transposon or by classical recombination with pjh2 has not been determined.

TI  == atp-driven sodium pump in streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == sodium extrusion by bacteria is generally attributed to secondary antiport of na+ for h+ energized by the proton circulation. streptococcus faecalis is an exception, in that sodium expulsion from intact cells requires the generation of  atp but does not depend on the protonmotive force. unfortunately, studies with everted membrane vesicles failed to reveal the expected sodium pump; instead, the vesicles contained a conventional secondary na+/h+ antiporter. we report here that everted membrane vesicles prepared in the presence of protease inhibitors retain an atp-driven sodium transport system. the evidence includes the findings  that (i) accumulation of 22na+ by these vesicles is resistant to reagents that dissipate the protonmotive force but requires atp and (ii) the vesicles contain a sodium-stimulated atpase that is distinct from f1f0 atpase, and whose presence is correlated with sodium transport activity. sodium movements appear to be electroneutral and are accompanied by movement of h+ in the opposite direction. when membranes are incubated in the absence of protease inhibitors, a secondary na+/h+ antiport activity emerges, possibly by degradation of the sodium pump. we  suggest that s. faecalis expels na+ by means of an atp-driven primary transport system that mediates exchange of na+ for h+. the na+/h+ antiporter seen in earlier membrane preparation is an artefact of proteolytic degradation.

TI  == second system for potassium transport in streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == it has been reported that the accumulation of k+ by streptococcus faecalis is mediated by a transport system which required both atp and the proton motive force (bakker and harold, j. biol. chem. 255:433-440, 1980). my results indicate  that s. faecalis has a second transport system for k+. the features of this system are as follows: (i) the system is driven by atp (or a derivative of atp) and does not require the proton motive force; (ii) the system is normally absent  in the wild-type strain but can be derepressed by lowering rhe intracellular concentration of k+; (iii) the ph optimum of this system is about 8.5, and no detectable k+ is accumulated at ph values below 6.5; and (iv) the rate of rb+ accumulation by this system is very low. these properties are quite different from those of the transport system described by bakker and harold. therefore, i propose that s. faecalis has two k+ transport systems.

TI  == role of glutathione in the regulation of inorganic pyrophosphatase activity in streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == when the thiol-oxidizing agent diamide was added to a batch culture of streptococcus faecalis during exponential growth, the specific activity of inorganic pyrophosphatase (ec 3.6.1.1) decreased to the level observed in the stationary phase. the effect of diamide was completely reversed by reduced glutathione. furthermore, the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione and the specific activity of inorganic pyrophosphatase changed in a very similar fashion  during batch culture. these findings, together with our earlier results, suggest  that the activity of inorganic pyrophosphatase in s. faecalis is regulated by glutathione via the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione.

TI  == membrane stimulation and intracellular killing by monocytes.
AB  == the present paper reviews our recent studies concerning the intracellular killing of bacteria by human monocytes and compares the results with those found for circulating granulocytes. the findings show that optimal intracellular killing of catalase-positive and catalase-negative bacteria is only reached during interaction of the fc part of igg and complement component c3b with their specific receptors in the membrane of the phagocytes. similar stimulation was found during interaction of plant lectins and their specific sugar moieties in the cell membrane. the studies permit the general conclusion that optimal intracellular killing of micro-organisms requires membrane stimulation, which occurs after triggering of certain receptors.

TI  == anatomical and immunological responses of rabbit gallbladders to bacterial infections.
AB  == to study the sequential morphological and immunological response of the rabbit gallbladder to bacterial infection and to compare the inflammatory responses with different pathogens, gallbladders were infected with streptococcus faecalis and two strains of escherichia coli, one of which produced enterotoxin. gallbladder infection was produced either by intravenously injecting bacteria into rabbits with a small liver infarct or by injecting bacteria directly into the gallbladder of normal rabbits. the percentage of gallbladders infected intravenously with a nonenterotoxigenic e. coli strain was 86% at 1 week, 70% at 3 weeks, and 15% at 6 weeks. epithelial necrosis and leukocyte infiltration were prominent 1 week after infection. at 3 and 6 weeks after infection, there was crypt distortion and increased mucus secretion in the epithelium as shown by periodic acid-schiff staining. the lamina propria was infiltrated with mononuclear cells, many of which were plasma cells. myofibroblasts (contractile fibroblasts) were also identified on transmission microscopy, in addition to these changes, toxigenic e. coli produced subepithelial capillary dilation in the villus core. morphological  changes (excluding toxin-associated changes) were related to the duration of infection rather than to the specific species of infecting bacteria. infected gallbladders studied by immunofluorescence had a greater than 50-fold increase in plasma cells compared with control cells. in addition, the number increased with  the duration of infection. immunoglobulin a cells were the major cell type in gallbladders infected by intravesical injection, whereas immunoglobulin g cells predominated in gallbladders infected intravenously. the gallbladder appears to mount a local immune response to bacterial infection.

AB  == twelve antimicrobial drugs were studied for their effect on the endogenous aerobic potentially pathogenic bacteria (enterobacteriaceae, streptococcus faecalis) in the intestines and on the colonization resistance (cr) of the digestive tract. three subclasses of antimicrobial drugs could be recognized: (1) those which suppress the cr following low oral doses (rifamycin, penicillin v, cloxacillin, fenethicillin); (2) those in which the cr is suppressed only following relatively high oral doses (amoxycillin); and (3) those in which no obvious suppression of the cr was noticed even following substantial oral doses (nalidixic acid, cinoxacin, co-trimoxazole, oral cephalosporins, piv-mecillinam and doxycyclin). some of the drugs in the third category were found to suppress endogenous enterobacteriaceae (nalidixic acid, co-trimoxazole, piv-mecillinam and doxycyclin) and s. faecalis (doxycyclin) at dose levels at which they did not decrease cr.

TI  == heterogeneity of tetracycline resistance determinants in streptococcus.
AB  == we found that naturally occurring tetracycline resistance in streptococci is encoded by more than one genetic determinant. two of these distinct determinants  were cloned, and the regions that are necessary and sufficient for expression of  tetracycline resistance were defined by deletion analysis. these cloned determinants were further characterized by dna-dna hybridization experiments which also identified a third genetically unrelated tetracycline resistance determinant. some of these genetic differences appear to represent mechanistic differences. the tetl determinant was associated with small nonconjugative plasmids and mediated resistance to tetracycline. the tetm determinant was most often "nonplasmid" associated and mediated resistance to minocycline as well as tetracycline. the tetn determinant was represented on a large conjugative plasmid and was genetically distinct from tetl and tetm, although phenotypically it resembled tetm.

TI  == high performance liquid chromatography of folates: identification of poly-gamma-glutamate chain lengths of labeled and unlabeled folates.
AB  == a sensitive method is described for the identification of the polyglutamate chain lengths of labeled and unlabeled folates in biological extracts. folates in bacterial or mammalian tissue extracts were quantitatively cleaved to rho-aminobenzoylpolyglutamates. the primary aromatic amines were converted to azo dyes of naphthylethylene diamine and were purified by chromatography on biogel p2 polyacrylamide columns. the purified azo dyes were reductively reconverted to rho-aminobenzoylpolyglutamates, which were separated according to glutamate chain length by high performance liquid chromatography on a partisil 10 sax anionic exchanger. unlabeled derivatives derived from tissue folates were detected and quantitated by their absorbance at 280 nm. lactobacillus casei contained folates  of glutamate chain length up to 11 with the octa- and nonaglutamates predominating, while tetraglutamates predominated in streptococcus faecalis. vitamin in rat liver was a mixture of pteroylmono- to heptaglutamate with the pentaglutamate predominating.

TI  == experimental endocarditis in rabbits. 6. results of long-term combined therapy of streptococcus faecalis endocarditis with penicillin and streptomycin.
AB  == the synergistic action of penicillin and streptomycin was investigated on animals with experimental endocarditis, using the previously described model and four different strains of streptococcus faecalis. two strains represented a moderate and two strains a high level of resistance to streptomycin. the purpose was to determine the effect of the combined penicillin and streptomycin treatment, since previous in vitro investigations showed that strains highly resistant to streptomycin were also resistant to combination of the drugs. antibiotic treatment of the animals was carried out for 28 days, followed by a period of four weeks observation. the treatment resulted in a demonstrable effect against infection caused by the least streptomycin-resistant strain, but was completely ineffective in rabbits infected with the strain homogeneously resistant to 8000 micrograms/ml streptomycin. the synergistic effect of penicillin and streptomycin towards strains within a range of streptomycin resistance of 2000-8000 micrograms/ml could be predicted by the ic50 test, but not by mic or the in vitro killing curve test for synergism. besides the therapeutic results, this report also considers the following features: pathoanatomic and physiologic processes related to the number of viable bacteria in the endocardial vegetations; the influence of the proteolytic capacity of infecting strains; the development of congestive heart failure.

AB  == a previously described model of experimental streptococcus faecalis endocarditis  in rabbits without an indwelling catheter during the infectious processes was used to study the effect of long-term treatment with antibiotics. groups of animals infected with six different strains were treated for four weeks and the following parameters were determined: survival rate, bacterial concentration in blood and vegetations, signs at autopsy indicating congestive heart failure. before the therapeutic experiments, the tolerance of the rabbit to long-term exposure of the drugs penicillin and streptomycin was considered in a group of non-infected animals. two out of 20 rabbits died with enteritis during the penicillin exposure, and a general weight reduction was observed. streptomycin was apparently completely harmless. there was no therapeutic effect of streptomycin on s. faecalis endocarditis due to strains all designated resistant  to streptomycin by mic, except in rabbits infected with a strain, which showed partial susceptibility to the drug by ic50. regardless of the therapeutic effect, evidence was obtained for rapid development of increased resistance of the infecting strains towards streptomycin. after long-term treatment with penicillin in either low or high dose some of the animals survived and the valves were sterilized in 37% of the animals after low-dose and in 39% after high-dose. it was observed that congestive heart failure occurred with the greatest frequency and intensity after infection with proteolytic strains.

AB  == the growth-inhibiting behaviour of abacterial, liquid pure cultures made up of three water algae (hydrodictyon reticulatum, chlorella vulgaris, aphanothece nidulans) which were made to grow profusely in special culture containers under constant exposure to light and ventilation was examined in ten different species  of microorganisms during a period of contact of 4 days both in the light and in the dark. subjected to the test were the 5 pathogenic species staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium and  candida albicans as well the 5 bacterial contamination indicators e. coli (faecal indicator), streptococcus faecalis (enterococci), enterobacter aerogenes ("coliforms"), staphylococcus epidermidis (dermic germ) and bacillus subtilis ("contamination germ"). it was found that --hydrodictyon reticulatum and aphanothece nidulans exert a strong antibacterial effect, while chlorella vulgaris provides no indication of a bacterial growth-inhibiting effect. --this antibiosis is linked with the assimilative activity of the algal cultures, as in  the dark no antibacterial action is discernible --the "antibiotic principle" must be liable to transitory or rapid disintegration because the algal cultures are ineffective in the dark and also culture filtrates of 5-days old algal cultures exercise no growth-inhibiting effect. with respect to the sanitation of waters it is important to state that a profuse growth of algae produces a certain, but hardly reliable "biological water disinfection" and renders difficult the assessment of the quality of a water-course as a result of the elimination of the usual contamination indicators. therefore, additional microbiological quality parameters must be used for assessment of pollution of swimming pools with strong algal growth.

AB  == the clinical records of 66 patients with bacterial endocarditis hospitalized in three community hospitals in saginaw, michigan, from 1964 through 1979 were reviewed. data from these nonreferral hospitals demonstrate that infective endocarditis often does not present to the primary care physician with classical  physical findings. the etiological organisms were noted to change from being primarily alpha-hemolytic streptococci during the early part of the study to staphylococci and streptococcus faecalis during later years. narcotic addiction was a factor of increasing importance in the development of endocarditis and in the changing microbiology of this clinical syndrome.

TI  == bacterial adhesion in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis. effect of subinhibitory antibiotic concentrations on streptococcal adhesion in vitro and the development of endocarditis in rabbits.
AB  == bacterial adhesion to the constituents of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (nbte) is important in the pathogenesis of endocarditis. subinhibitory concentrations (submic) of some antibiotics decrease bacterial adhesion to epithelial cells in vitro. we utilized an in vitro assay system to study the effect of submic of various antibiotics on streptococcal adhesion to a fibrin-platelet matrix (simulating nbte). the results were (a) bacterial adhesion of streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus faecalis to nbte was significantly reduced by vancomycin, penicillin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and streptomycin (p less than 0.01 vs. controls) but not rifampin or trimethoprimsulfametrole; (b) the effect was dose-dependent and increased with duration of exposure to antibiotic; (c) reduction in bacterial adhesion did not correlate with altered retention by hydrophobic-interaction chromatography. this reduction in adhesion correlated with a diminished capacity of submic exposed streptococcus sanguis (1/4 vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) x 4 h) to produce endocarditis in vivo. after intravenous inoculation of 10(6) colony-forming units of preincubated organisms into rabbits with traumatized aortic valves, 6 of 22 developed endocarditis vs. 17 of 22 controls (p = 0.03). these results may be relevant to prophylaxis of endocarditis since exposure of bacteria to submic of various antibiotics may reduce bacterial adherence both, to mucosal surfaces, and to damaged cardiac valves.

AB  == the activities of ampicillin, rifampin, streptomycin, and their combinations were evaluated in vitro against streptococcus faecalis strain gk and in vivo in rats with an established pyelonephritis resulting from challenge with this same enterococcus. in vitro synergy was demonstrated between all combinations. comparison of the log colony-forming units of s. faecalis recovered per gram of kidney tissue showed that all treated groups had significant lower numbers than controls (p less than 0.001). ampicillin plus streptomycin or ampicillin alone was superior to rifampin alone or rifampin plus streptomycin at each interval (p  less than 0.001). there was no significant difference between ampicillin and rifampin plus ampicillin. the disparity between in vitro and in vivo results again raises some doubts as to the relevance of in vitro observations to clinical outcome.

TI  == homology among tet determinants in conjugative elements of streptococci.
AB  == a mutation to tetracycline sensitivity in a resistant strain of streptococcus pneumoniae was shown by several criteria to be due to a point mutation in the conjugative omega (cat-tet) element found in the chromosomes of strains derived from bm6001, a clinical strain resistant to tetracycline and chloramphenicol. strains carrying the mutation were transformed back to tetracycline resistance with the high efficiency of a point marker by donor deoxyribonucleic acids from its ancestral strain and from nine other clinical isolates of pneumococcus and by deoxyribonucleic acids from group d streptococcus faecalis and group b streptococcus agalactiae strains that also carry conjugative tet elements in their chromosomes. it was not transformed to resistance by tet plasmid deoxyribonucleic acids from either gram-negative or gram-positive species, except for one that carried transposon tn916, the conjugative tet element present in the chromosomes of some s. faecalis strains. the results showed that the tet determinants in conjugative elements of several streptococcal species share a high degree of deoxyribonucleic acid sequence homology and suggested that they differ from other tet genes.

TI  == folylpoly-gamma-glutamate synthesis by bacteria and mammalian cells.
AB  == the purification and properties of folylpolyglutamate synthetase from corynebacterium sp, and some properties of partially purified enzyme from lactobacillus casei, streptococcus faecalis, neurospora crassa, pig liver, and chinese hamster ovary cells, are described. the corynebacterium enzyme catalyzes  a mgatp-dependent addition of glutamate to a variety of reduced pteroate and pteroylmono-, di-, and triglutamate substrates, with the concomitant production of mgadp and phosphate. although glutamate moieties are added in a sequential fashion, the kinetic mechanism, which is ordered ter ter, precludes the sequential addition of glutamate moieties to enzyme-bound folate. it is suggested that catalysis precedes via the formation of a pteroyl-gamma-glutamyl phosphate intermediate. the in vivo distribution of folylpolyglutamates in bacteria and mammalian cells, which differ from source to source, appear to be a reflection of the ability of folylpolyglutamates to act as substrates for folylpolyglutamate synthetases from different sources. only one enzyme appears to be involved in the conversion of pteroylmonoglutamates to polyglutamate forms in both bacteria and mammalian cells. bacterial folylpolyglutamate synthetases use a variety of pteroylmonoglutamates as their preferred monoglutamate substrate, but use 5,10-methylenetetrahydro-pteroylpolyglutamates as their preferred, and sometimes  only, polyglutamate substrate. mono- and polyglutamyl forms of tetrahydrofolate are the preferred substrates of mammalian folylpolyglutamate synthetases.

TI  == interconversion of components of the bacterial proton motive force by electrogenic potassium transport.
AB  == the influence of k+ ions on the components of the transmembrane proton motive force (delta mu h+) in intact bacteria was investigated. in k+-depleted cells of  the glycolytic bacterium streptococcus faecalis the addition of k+ ions caused a  depolarization of the membrane by about 60 mv. however, since the depolarization  was compensated for by an increase in the transmembrane ph gradient (delta ph), the total proton motive force remained almost constant at about 120 mv. half-maximal changes in the potential were observed at k+ concentrations at which the cells accumulated k+ ions extensively. in edta-treated, k+-depleted cells of  escherichia coli k-12, the addition of k+ ions to the medium caused similar, although smaller changes in the components of delta mu h+. experiments with various e. coli k-12 k+ transport mutants showed that for the observed potential  changes the cells required either a functional trka or kdp k+ transport system. these data are interpreted to mean that the inward movement of k+ ions via each of these bacterial transport systems is electrogenic. consequently, it leads to a depolarization of the membrane, which in its turn allows the cell to pump more protons into the medium.

TI  == radiosensitization of microorganisms by radical anions. ii. streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == the inactivation of streptococcus faecalis by radiolytically generated selective  inorganic radical anions was investigated. the br-2 radical, but not (cns)-2, had a pronounced radiosensitizing action. in gamma-irradiated solutions at ph 7.0, the radiosensitization of a variety of scavenging systems was studied. among these the d10 for n2/br- was 0.082 kgy while n2o/cns- = 0.35 kgy, n2o = 0.25 kgy, n2 = 0.47, and o2 = 0.16 kgy. as shown previously, inactivation in n2o/br- systems is due mainly to br2 and hobr. from the variation of the inactivation with ph by br-2 and (cns)-2 it was deduced that tyrosine is crucial for the survival of s. faecalis via inactivation of enzymes with essential tyrosine residues such as aldolase and lipoyl dehydrogenase which are presumably needed to make energy available for dna repair. studies with a variety of scavengers also revealed that the t-butanol radical produced some radiosensitization of s. faecalis while the damaging effect of e-aq was much less than oh as shown by the  d10 at ph 7.0; n2/t-butanol = 0.32 and n2/ethanol = 0.71. the radiosensitizing action of br-2 in a natural environment containing sewage sludge was also determined, using the faecal streptococcal group as test organisms.

TI  == radiosensitization of microorganisms by radical anions. i. medium effects.
AB  == irradiation of streptococcus faecalis in a neutral, n2o/br- system leads to practically complete killing with extraordinarily low doses of irradiation, namely a d10 of 13 gy compared to 470 gy in n2, 250 gy in n2o and 160 gy in o2. however, irradiation and chemical investigations demonstrated that the apparent radiosensitization in neutral, n2o/br- is due mainly to bromine, br2 and hobr rather than br-3 or the radical anion, br-2. for example, addition of unirradiated bacteria to a previously irradiated neutral solution of n2o/br- reduces survival. the medium effects are eliminated by radiation chemical and/or  chemical reactions which destroy bromine, such as occur in basic solutions, in n2/br- or o2/br- systems because of back reactions of br2 with e-aq in the former and of br2 with h2o2 and o-2 in the latter. neither are medium effects produced in n2o/br- systems at ph greater than 9. however, in n2/br- the d10 = 82 gy compared to 160 gy in o2 which indicates that for s. faecalis br-2 is intrinsically a more effective radiosensitizing agent than oxygen.

TI  == purification and characterization of the membrane adenosine triphosphatase complex from the wild-type and n,n'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-resistant strains of streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == we have purified the f1-f0 adenosine triphosphatase complex from wild-type streptococcus faecalis atcc 9790 and an n,n'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (dccd)-resistant mutant strain, sf-dcc-8. for preliminary purification of the complex, reconstituted f1-f0, prepared from isolated f1 adenosine triphosphatase  and depleted membranes, was extracted with sodium deoxycholate and fractionated by salt precipitation. by means of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, the f1-f0 complex was purified as a single, catalytically active band in the first dimension and then resolved into constituent subunits under denaturing conditions in the second dimension. the electrophoretic purification of f1-f0 removed a delta-less form of f1 as well as other impurities, including lipoteichoic acid. both the dccd-sensitive and the dccd-resistant f1-f0 adenosine triphosphatase appeared to consist of eight proteins, five of which corresponded to the f1 subunits alpha, beta,, gamma, delta, and epsilon. the f0 sector proteins, designated m27, m15, and m6, had mr values of 27,000, 15,000, and 6,000, respectively. there appear to be multiple copies of m6 in the complex. [14c]dccd  reacted specifically and covalently with m6 in the wild-type f1-f0 but failed to  label the m6 protein in the complex from the dccd-resistant strain. it is suggested that dccd resistance in the sf-dcc-8 mutant may be due to a modification of the m6 protein which hinders access of dccd to the reactive site.

TI  == nucleoid structure in freeze fractures of streptococcus faecalis: effects of filtration and chilling.
AB  == with the techniques used in this study, the nucleoid of streptococcus faecalis could not be seen in freeze-etch preparations unless glutaraldehyde had been added to cultures of cells before they were frozen. with time, the nucleoid became visible as a network of fibers, apparently as a result of the aggregation  of individual chromosomal elements in the presence of glutaraldehyde. when glutaraldehyde was added to undisturbed cultures, the fibers that became visible  were observed in small patches that were seemingly scattered throughout the cytoplasm. however, if cells were chilled or placed on filters before glutaraldehyde was added, the fibers which then developed were seen in large central areas. the appearance of centralized nucleoids in freeze fractures of cells that had been chilled or filtered could be correlated with a decrease in the central density of the cytoplasm, as seen by light microscopy, in cells embedded in gelatin or bovine serum albumin. these observations are discussed in  relation to a model for the normal structure of the nucleoid which suggests that  the treatments routinely used to study the morphology-physiology of cells (chilling, filtration, and fixation) result in a reorganization of the cytoplasm, leading to an increase in the centralization of nuclear material.

AB  == cellular autolytic activity as well as lipid and lipoteichoic acid metabolism have been studied in cultures of streptococcus faecalis receiving various combinations of the following treatments: chloramphenicol addition, starvation for an essential amino acid (valine), and cerulenin treatment. lipoteichoic acid  initially accumulated in chloramphenicol-treated and amino acid-starved cells and decreased relative to the cellular mass in cerulenin-treated cells. the relative  phosphatidylglycerol content of amino acid-starved cultures or of cultures treated with either antibiotic rapidly decreased upon initiation of each treatment. in all cases, cerulenin initially stimulated diphosphatidylglycerol synthesis. pretreatment of cultures with cerulenin prevented the inhibition of cellular synthesis autolysis normally observed during chloramphenicol treatment,  but did not affect amino acid starvation-induced inhibition of autolytic activity. variations in the levels of the nonionic lipid fraction, predominantly  diglycerides, correlated best with the patterns of autolytic activity observed during chloramphenicol treatment, whereas variations in the levels of diphosphatidylglycerol and lipoteichoic acid correlated best with the patterns of autolytic activity observed during amino acid starvation. components of the nonionic lipid fraction were demonstrated to inhibit autolytic activity 50% in whole cell and in cell wall assays at 60 and 120 nmol/mg (dry weight), respectively.

TI  == active transport of ca2+ in bacteria: bioenergetics and function.
AB  == the bioenergetics of ca2+ transport in bacteria are discussed with special emphasis on the interrelationship between transport and other cellular functions  such as substrate oxidation by the respiratory chain and oxidative phosphorylation. the unusual polarity of ca2+ movement provides an exceptional tool to compare active transport and other atp requiring or generating processes  since this ion is actively taken up by everted vesicles in which the coupling-factor atpase is exposed to the external medium. as inferred from studies with everted vesicles, the active extrusion of ca2+ by whole cells can be accomplished by substrate driven respiration, hydrolysis of atp or as in the case of streptococcus faecalis by a nonhydrolytic unknown process which involves atp directly. substrate oxidation and the hydrolysis of atp result in the generation  of a ph gradient which can energize the ca2+ uptake directly (ca2+/h+ antiport) or via a secondary na+ gradient (ca2+/na+ antiport). in contrast to exponentially growing cells sporulating bacilli accumulate ca2+ during the synthesis of dipicolinic acid. studies involving ca2+ transport provided evidence in support of the hypothesis that the mg2+ atpase from escherichia coli not only provides the driving force for various cellular functions but exerts a regulatory role by  controlling the permeability of the membrane to protons. the different specificity requirements of various naphthoquinone analogs in the restoration of  transport or oxidative phosphorylation, after the natural menaquinone has been destroyed by irradiation, has indicated that a protonmotive force is sufficient to drive active transport. however, in addition to the driving force (protonmotive force) necessary to establish oxidative phosphorylation, a specific spatial orientation of the respiratory components, such as the naphthoquinones, is essential for the utilization of the proton gradient or membrane potential or  both. finally, evidence suggesting that intracellular ca2+ levels might play a fundamental role in bacterial homeostasis is discussed, in particular the role of ca2+ in the process of chemotaxis and in conferring bacteria heat stability. a vitamin k-dependent carboxylation reaction has been found in escherichia coli which is similar to that reported in mammalian systems which results in gamma carboxylation of glutamate residues. although all of the proteins containing gamma-carboxyglutamate described so far are involved in ca2+ metabolism, the role of these proteins in escherichia coli is unknown and remains to be elucidated.

TI  == resistance to antibiotic synergism in streptococcus faecalis: further studies with amikacin and with a new amikacin derivative, 4'-deoxy, 6'-n-methylamikacin.
AB  == streptococcus faecalis strains may resist penicillin-aminoglycoside synergy by the production of plasmid-mediated aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes. one of these enzymes, aminoglycoside 3'-phosphotransferase, has been shown to have a broad range of substrate specificity, including amikacin. we have studied a derivative  of amikacin, 4'-deoxy, 6'-n-methylamikacin (bb-k311), against 11 clinical blood isolates of s. faecalis. minimal inhibitory concentrations of bb-k311 were quite  similar to those of amikacin, ranging from 125 to 1,000 micrograms/ml. in assays  for antibiotic synergy, penicillin and amikacin produced enhanced killing compared with the penicillin alone only against those three strains which lacked  the phosphotransferase enzyme. the other eight enzyme-positive strains actually demonstrated significant antagonism between penicillin against all 11 strains, regardless of enzyme production. analysis of substrate profiles with crude preparations of the aminoglycoside 3'-phosphotransferase enzyme confirmed that bb-k311 was a very poor substrate for modification, as expected from the synergy  studies. use of other aminoglycoside analogs confirmed the 3'-oh site of modification. these findings suggest that removing the 4'-oh group in amikacin effectively blocks 3'-phosphorylation by s. faecalis enzyme.

AB  == gentamicin-thallous-carbonate (gtc) agar was formulated by donnelly and hartman (appl. environ. microbiol. 35:576-581, 1978) to select for fecal streptococci in  sewage and water samples. the present study was conducted to determine the usefulness of gtc agar for the enumeration of fecal streptococci in foods. comparisons were made with kf streptococcal (kf), pfizer selective enterococcus (pse), and thallous acetate (ta) agars. samples of ground beef pork sausage, frozen broccoli, frozen fish, and ice cream were examined. presumptive streptococcal counts obtained on gtc agar were significantly higher than those obtained on kf and pse agars and were comparable to those obtained on ta agar. gtc was more sensitive than kf or pse agars primarily because of the recovery of  greater numbers of streptococcus bovis and streptococcus equinus strains. percentages of confirmed fecal streptococci obtained on gtc, kf, pse, and ta agars were 70, 95, 80, and 74, respectively. differences between these percentages were not statistically significant, but they indicated that selectivity of gtc agar could be improved. advantages of using gtc agar to isolate fecal streptococci from foods include a short incubation time (16 to 18 h) and large, distinct colonies that facilitate rapid enumeration and subsequent  confirmation.

AB  == cefotaxime activity was studied in pediatric practice on the intestinal bacteria  flora of 10 children, by means of a differential quantitative method for aerobic  and anaerobic faecal flora and was compared to that of 41 controls not receiving  any antibiotics. cefotaxime was given alone in 7 children, and in combination with gentamicin in 3. an effect on the intestinal bacterial flora was noted on e. coli, which disappeared in 4 cases and diminished considerably in 5. a slight increase in streptococcus d was observed without excessive multiplication of the  flora. the study showed no significant alteration for the other aerobic or anaerobic bacilli. there was no selection of resistant organisms. cefotaxime is a new cephalosporin which does not seem to produce an increase in many resistant pathogens due to a break-down of the barrier effect observed on the bacterial flora of the gut in children.

TI  == [interest of humoral antibodies assay for diagnosis and survey of urinary tract infections by gram negative bacilli and streptococcus d in children (author's transl)].
AB  == the assay of humoral antibodies during urinary tract infections of children is performed by passive haemagglutination. in gram negative bacilli infections (176  children) the antigens are derived from the patients' bacteria. for streptococcus d infections the antigen is a phenol extract, specifically tested and used for all streptococcus d urinary tract infections (40 children). the humoral antibodies assay is of first interest to distinguish between high urinary tract infections with renal parenchym bacterial involvement and low urinary tract infections. in high urinary tract infections the antibodies are significantly elevated and almost surely indicate renal infection for a 1/2 560 titre; they raise both in gram negative bacteria and in streptococcus d infections. there is  however a difference in a rather higher number of cases of streptococcus d infections where it is impossible of connect high sera titres and clinical symptoms of pyelonephritis, contrary to gram negative bacilli infections. it seems to be due to aetiological differences in urinary tract infections by streptococcus d, which are more often secondary infections, during severe urologic diseases. in such cases the symptomatology of infections is less typical than in e. coli urinary tract infections. another interest is the capacity of survey by this method. three kinds of courses of antibody titres are observed: the first is a clean break of titre lower than 1/160 after three months; the second is the continuance of the same high levels over three months; the third is continuance of high significative level after a first incomplete fall. in the last two cases it is highly probable that a pyelonephritis processes is engaged.  this may be useful for treatment and survey of children with urologic diseases.

AB  == thirty-two human isolates of enterococci were tested for antibiotic synergy by using penicillin and one of six aminoglycosides. three methods were used: synergy screen, microdilution checkerboard, and time-kill curves. the synergy screen accurately predicted synergy for gentamicin-penicillin combinations, and this synergy was later confirmed by time-kill curves. the microdilution checkerboard method suffered from inherent variation, and agreement with time-kill curves ranged from 92% (twofold reduction in minimum inhibitory concentration) to 4.2% (fourfold reduction in minimum inhibitory concentration). we suggest that enterococci be screened for synergy (i.e., presence or absence of high-level resistance) by using the criterion of growth or no growth in the presence of 2,000 microgram of an aminoglycoside per ml. the microdilution checkerboard test  for synergy is not recommended.

TI  == evidence for a chromosome-borne resistance transposon (tn916) in streptococcus faecalis that is capable of "conjugal" transfer in the absence of a conjugative plasmid.
AB  == streptococcus faecalis strain ds16 harbors the conjugative hemolysin-bacteriocin  plasmid pad1 (35 megadaltons) and the nonconjugative r-plasmid pad2 determining resistance to streptomycin, kanamycin, and erythromycin; a tetracycline resistance (tetr) determinant is located on the chromosome. when strain ds16 was  mated (on membrane filters) with the plasmid-free strain jh2-2, tetr transconjugants could be obtained at a frequency of about 10(-6) per recipient. analyses of transconjugants showed that some contained the tetr determinant linked to pad1. subsequent studies showed that the tetr determinant was located on a 10-megaldalton transposon, designated tn916, which could insert into two hemolysin plasmids: pam gamma 1 and pob1. in addition, derivatives of ds16 devoid of pad1 were capable of transferring tetr to recipient strains. transconjugants (plasmid-free) from such matings could subsequently act as donors in the transfer of tetr. both transposition and transfer were found to be rec independent.

AB  == the activity of inorganic pyrophosphatase (ec 3.6.1.1) from streptococcus faecalis atcc 8043 decreased rapidly, when the cell extracts prepared by lysozyme and osmotic shock were incubated in a buffer solution (ph 8.0) at 25-50 degrees c. increase in ph (from 8.5 to 10.5) retarded the inactivation considerably. the  low activity level was reached in 2.5 h at 37 degrees c (ph 8.0) and this residual activity was stable during prolonged incubation. the enzyme in the form  of low activity was not rapidly denatured until at 70 degrees c. the inactivation could be prevented and reversed by cysteine, dithiotreitol and 2-mercaptoethanol, but reductants, which do not contain sh-groups were not effective. reduced glutathione slowed down and oxidized glutathione stimulated the inactivation. with pure enzyme it was shown that the low, stable activity level obtained with crude extracts during incubation is a property of inorganic pyrophosphatase and not due to another enzyme with a low capacity to hydrolyze inorganic pyrophosphate. these findings suggest that inorganic pyrophosphatase form s. faecalis exists in two interconvertible forms which differ in activity.

TI  == atp-linked sodium transport in streptococcus faecalis. i. the sodium circulation.
AB  == streptococcus faecalis, like other bacteria, expels na+ and accumulates k+. sodium movements in several bacterial species have been attributed to secondary antiport of na+ for h+, energized by the proton-motive force. we find a more complex pattern: a circulation of na+ across the plasma membrane. one limb is the diffusion of na+, into the cells or out, by a low affinity pathway in response to gradients of concentration and of electrical potential; na+ movements are enhanced in metabolizing cells. the other limb is the vectorial extrusion of na+  by a transport system that requires "atp" (either atp itself or a related metabolite), even when na+ is moving downhill. cells glycolyzing at alkaline ph in buffer containing excess k+ can expel na+ against a concentration gradient of  100-fold, even in the presence of reagents that block or short circuit the proton circulation (ph gradient and membrane potential both zero). evidently, under these conditions "atp" can serve as the energy donor for a primary sodium pump. however, at acid ph, or in presence of low levels of k+, sodium extrusion requires both "atp" and the proton-motive force. a mutant is described that retains the leak pathway but lacks the "atp"-linked transport system.

TI  == identification of the lethal target of benzylpenicillin in streptococcus faecalis by in vivo penicillin binding studies.
AB  == the mode of bacterial killing by penicillins is still unknown in spite of many studies on the subject. the recent finding of multiple penicillin binding proteins (pbps) in sensitive bacteria and the possibility of analysing the binding of the antibiotic to exponentially growing cells have provided new directions for investigating this problem. sensitivity to lethal and other effects of penicillin varies very significantly with the conditions of growth of  the cells. if pbps were the penicillin target, changes in conditions of growth causing variations in penicillin sensitivity should be accompanied by changes in  these proteins. furthermore, if one of pbps could be identified as the killing target, it could possibly be demonstrated to show changes in cells growing in different conditions. we show here that in streptococcus faecalis atcc 9790 changes in conditions of growth are accompanied by changes in pbps. furthermore,  in the presence of the minimal dose of 14c-benzylpenicillin causing complete inhibition of cell growth, 100% of the total radioactivity is bound to a single protein (pbp 3).

TI  == the penicillin-binding proteins in streptococcus faecalis atcc 9790.
AB  == streptococcus faecalis atcc 9790 possesses seven membrane-bound penicillin-binding proteins. they have been characterized with respect to their apparent molecular weights, relative abundance, specificity profiles for 15 different beta-lactam antibiotics and stability under various conditions. in water and at 37 degrees c, all the native penicillin-binding proteins have half-lives longer than 20 h except protein 3b (half-life of about 600 min) and protein 4 (half-life of about 175 min). the short-lived 80 000-mr protein 4 is spontaneously converted into a 73 000-mr water-soluble, penicillin-binding protein 4. similarly, the short-lived 82 000-mr protein 3b seems to be the protein from which the 72 000-mr water-soluble protein x spontaneously originates during incubation of the membranes. release of both proteins 4 and x from the membrane is maximal under alkaline conditions; it is not inhibited by various protease inhibitors. after exposure to trypsin, the 43 000-mr membrane-bound penicillin binding protein 6 (a dd-carboxypeptidase) gives to a 30 000-mr water-soluble protein 6. like the parent protein, protein 6 exhibits both dd-carboxypeptidase activity and penicillin-binding ability. with proteins 6 and  6, low dose levels of p-chloromercuribenzoate prevent both enzyme activity and combination with penicillin, thus strongly suggesting that a thiol group is involved in the enzyme active center. we have shown previously [coyette et al. in eur. j. biochem. 88, 297--305 (1978) and 75, 231--239 (1977)] that the dd-carboxypeptidase protein 6 fragments the benzylpenicillin molecule with formation of phenylacetylglycine. breakdown of the complex formed between [14c]benzylpenicillin and 14 000-mr membrane-bound protein 1 is also 'enzyme-catalysed'. most likely, however, the released product is penicilloate. with all the other penicillin-binding proteins whose molecular weights are intermediate between those of proteins 1 and 6, breakdown of the complexes formed with [14c]benzylpenicillin results from proteolysis and is not due to the release of the bound metabolite. none of the penicillin-binding proteins behaves, by itself, as a lethal target for beta-lactam antibiotic action on the living cells.

TI  == streptococcus faecalis mutants defective in regulation of cytoplasmic ph.
AB  == we have isolated two acid-sensitive mutants of streptococcus faecalis (atcc 9790), designated as13 and as25, which grew at ph 7.5 but not at ph below 6.0. the ionophore gramicidin d, which collapsed the ph gradient between the cytoplasm and the medium, had little effect on the growth of these mutants, indicating that growing cells maintain only a small ph gradient. in the presence of gramicidin d  the growth rates of the parent and mutant strains were identical over a range of  ph values. when glucose was added to a cell suspension at ph 6.4, the parent strain generated a ph gradient of 1.0 unit, interior alkaline; as13 generated a ph gradient of only 0.5 units, and as25 generated no measurable ph gradient. the  proton permeability of the mutant strains was the same as that of the parent strain. these results suggest that a cytoplasmic ph of around 7.5 is required for the growth of the cells and that the mutant strains are unable to establish a neutral cytoplasmic ph in acidic medium because of damage to the regulatory system of the cytoplasmic ph. mutant strains also have a reduced capacity to extrude protons and take up potassium. therefore, it is likely that these cation  transport systems are involved in the regulation of cytoplasmic ph.

AB  == the essential sulfhydryl group of the ornithine transcarbamylases (ornithine carbamoyltransferase, 2.1.3.3) from bovine liver and streptococcus faecalis reacts preferentially with 2-chloromercuri-4-nitrophenol. the spectra of this derivative between ph 4.4 and 8.8 have been resolved into the spectrum of the nitrophenolate ion (iii) and two species of phenol (i and ii). the lambda max of  i and ii (both enzymes) and iii (bovine) are red shifted from those of the comparable species in the same derivative of 2-mercaptoethanol. deprotonation of  a residue on the enzyme must be responsible for the transition from i to ii. the  pk values of the phenolic group are 7.1 (mercaptoethanol), 7.7 (bovine), and 8.8  (s. faecalis). the red shift in the lambda max of iii and the modest increase in  the pk of the phenolic group are consistent with a relatively hydrophobic environment for the nitrophenolate ion in the bovine enzyme. since deprotonation  of the residue in the bovine enzyme perturbs the pk of the phenolic group only slightly, its effect may be indirect. interaction with a neighboring carboxyl group (pk 5.3) would account for the large increase in the pk of the phenolic group in the s. faecalis enzyme, which is not accompanied by an appreciable shift in the lambda max. carbamyl-p increases the pk of the phenolic group in both enzymes, a result consistent with its binding site being close to the essential sulfhydryl group.

AB  == the essential sulfhydryl group of the ornithine transcarbamylases (ornithine carbamoyltrasferase, 2.1.3.3) from bovine liver and streptococcus faecalis reacts slowly with aromatic disulfides at alkaline ph. but at ph 4.5, the apparent second-order rate constant for the reaction of this group in the s. faecalis enzyme with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (nbs2) is 40-fold that for the reaction of 2-mercaptoethanol. this enhanced reactivity at acid ph, because it occurs only with anionic, aromatic disulfides and results in rates greater than those for low molecular weight thiols, must be due to a specific interaction with these reagents. the nbs derivatives of both enzymes are inactive; the cyano derivatives prepared from them by cyanolysis are active but with greatly increased kmorn. the slow rates of cyanolysis and thiolysis suggest that access to the nbs residue is limited. also, the red shift of the spectrum of the nbs residue in the enzymes from that of nbs2 implies that its microenvironment is different from that of the bulk medium. deprotonation of a residue in the s. faecalis enzyme causes a further red shift. since even the small, uncharged cyano group interferes with the binding of ornithine to both enzymes, the essential sulfhydryl group may actually be a part of the binding site for ornithine.

TI  == morphological effect of cerulenin treatment on streptococcus faecalis as studied  by ultrastructure reconstruction.
AB  == exponential-phase cells of streptococcus faecalis atcc 9790 were treated with a concentration of cerulenin (5 micrograms/ml) that has been shown to block both lipoteichoic acid and lipid synthesis and cell division within 10 min. the morphological effect of this treatment was studied by making three-dimensional reconstructions of cells based on measurements taken from axial thin sections. this analysis indicated that cerulenin interferes with cell division by inhibiting normal constriction of the division furrow and centripetal growth of the cross wall in envelope growth sites. rather than dividing, many of the sites  in treated cells apparently continue to elongate and produce abnormally large amounts of peripheral wall surface. these observations were interpreted in terms  of a previously proposed model in which cerulenin would prevent the synthesis of  a lipid-containing inhibitor of autolytic enzyme activity needed for division. in addition, measurements showed that the average number of envelope growth sites per cell increased during treatment, suggesting that although cerulenin treatment blocks division, it does not interfere with the formation of new envelope growth  sites. it was also observed that the size and frequency of mesosomes did not decline during the 60-min period of drug treatment. this tends to decrease the likelihood that mesosomes are formed from a pool of intracellular membrane precursors that would be depleted during a period of restricted lipid biosynthesis.

TI  == bacterial effect of hydrogen peroxide on urinary tract pathogens.
AB  == bacterial contamination of urinary drainage bags is a frequent source of bladder  bacteriuria in patients with indwelling catheters. previous work demonstrated that the addition of 30 ml of 3% h2o2 prevented bacterial contamination of urinary drainage bags for up to 8 h in patients with urinary infections (greater  than 10(5) colony-forming units per ml). survival curves of a variety of organisms in filter-sterilized urine with various concentrations of h2o2 (0.6 to  0.01%) were constructed. organisms with high cellular catalase activity (staphylococcus aureus, serratia marcescens, and proteus mirabilis) required 30 to 60 min of exposure to 0.6% h2o2 for a reduction of 10(8) to less than 1 colony-forming unit per ml, whereas escherichia coli, streptococcus sp., and pseudomonas sp. required only 15 min of exposure. the efficacy of h2o2 in urine was maintained despite exposure to room temperature for 5 days and reinoculation  with bacterial suspensions. h2o2 is inexpensive and relatively nontoxic, and these data suggest that periodic instillation of h2o2 into urinary drainage bags  may eliminate a source of bladder bacteriuria and environmental contamination.

TI  == plasmid-mediated resistance to aminocyclitol antibiotics in group d streptococci.
AB  == streptococcus faecalis bm4100 was resistant to high levels of gentamicin, kanamycin, and structurally related antibiotics. the genes conferring resistance  to aminocyclitols in this strain were carried by a plasmid, pip800, self-transferable to other s. faecalis strains. the aminocyclitol resistance was  mediated by constitutively synthesized phosphotransferase and acetyltransferase activities. it was inferred that phosphorylation occurred at the 2"-hydroxyl group and that acetylation occurred at the 6'-hydroxyl group of the aminocyclitols. the enzyme activities were not separable by gel filtration or by  isoelectric focusing. their apparent molecular weight was 31,000, and their isoelectric point was 5.3. with respect to substrate profile, size, and charge, the transferases from strain bm4100 resembled closely those with identical site specificity described in staphylococci. these results suggest that plasmid gene transfer may occur between the two pathogenic bacterial genera.

TI  == unit cell hypothesis for streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == the mass doubling times of exponential-phase cultures of streptococcus faecalis were varied from 30 to 110 min by omitting glutamine from a defined growth medium and providing different concentrations of glutamate (ranging from 300 to 14 mug/ml). after formalin fixation, cells were dried by the critical point method,  and carbon-platinum replicas were prepared. the surface area and volume of cell poles seen in these replicas were estimated by a computer-assisted, three-dimensional reconstruction technique. it was found that the amount of surface area and volume of poles seen in these replicas were independent of the growth rate of culture from which the samples were taken. these observations were consistent with the unit cell model hypothesis of donachie and begg, in which a small number of surface sites would produce a constant amount of new cell surface regardless of the mass doubling time of the culture. however, measurements of the thickness of the cell wall taken from thin sections of the same cells showed that the cell wall increased in thickness as a function of the increase in cellular peptidoglycan content which occurs when the growth rate of this organism is slowed down by a decrease in glutamate concentration. thus, it would seem that although the size of polar shells made by s. faecalis is invariant with growth rate, the amount of wall precursors used to construct these shells is not.

AB  == phosphatidylkojibiosyl diacylglycerol functions as the acceptor of sn-glycerol 1-phosphate moieties from phosphatidylglycerol in the in vitro synthesis of the membrane lipoteichoic acid of streptococcus faecium (s. faecalis atcc 9790). the  enzyme catalyzing this polymer-forming reaction is membrane-bound. the majority of the product is water-soluble, is excluded from sepharose 6b, and, after longer incubations, changes to a form that co-precipitates with protein upon exposure to a denaturing agent. these properties are shared by the polyglycerol phosphate-containing membrane lipoteichoic acid isolated from whole cells of s. faecium. however, unlike the lipoteichoic acid generated in vivo, the glycerol phosphate polymer portion of the product synthesized in vitro is not substituted  and, therefore, is considered a nascent lipoteichoic acid intermediate.

AB  == the structure of the nucleoid of streptococcus faecalis (atcc 9790) was examined  and compared in the unfixed and fixed states by immersive refractometry and electron microscopy. it appears from these studies that the nucleoid structure is much more centralized in unfixed chloramphenicol-treated (stationary-phase) cells than it is in cells in the exponential phase of growth. the more dispersed configuration of the exponential-phase nucleoid could be preserved by fixation in glutaraldehyde, but not in formalin or in osmium tetroxide. one important factor  in explaining these differences in preservation is that glutaraldehyde (but not formalin or osmium tetroxide) can rapidly cross-link the amino groups of macromolecules in cells. it was also observed that osmium tetroxide resulted in a preferential breakdown of nascent ribonucleic acid. these results are interpreted as indicating that glutaraldehyde is able to stabilize the exponential-phase nucleoid before it assumes the more central appearance seen in osmium tetroxide-  and formalin-fixed cells. these results are discussed in terms of the proposed organization of the exponential-phase nucleoid in unfixed cells.

TI  == effect of macromolecular synthesis and lytic capacity on surface growth of streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == exposure of exponential-phase cultures of streptococcus faecalis to any of three  inhibitors of protein synthesis was accompanied by an increase in the average distance that the cross wall extended into the cytoplasm. this resulted in: (i) an increase in the average surface area of the cross wall (sa) and (ii) septation occurring in the envelope growth sites that were much smaller than the controls.  however, although at the concentrations used, all three antibiotics inhibited protein synthesis and autolytic capacity to the same extent and with the same kinetics, cells treated with these agents showed large differences in the rate at which sa values increased above those of the untreated cells. the largest increases in sa were observed in cells that synthesized the least amount of cytoplasmic macromolecules (deoxyribonucleic acid, plus ribonucleic acid, plus protein). the observations were interpreted in terms of a model in which a decreased lytic capacity reduces the rate of splitting of the nascent cross wall  into two layers of peripheral wall, preferentially using wall precursors to close open cross walls. however, the extent to which centripetal growth occurs would be inversely related to the rate at which cytoplasmic macromolecules are synthesized. in contrast, inhibition of deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis was accompanied by decreased extension of the leading edge of the cross wall into the cytoplasm, thus antagonizing septation. these findings are discussed in relation  to the normal cell division cycle of s. faecalis.

TI  == energy coupling to potassium transport in streptococcus faecalis. interplay of atp and the protonmotive force.
AB  == we have studied the mechanism by which metabolic energy is coupled to potassium accumulation by the fermentative bacterium, streptococcus faecalis. in starving cells, k+ movements into the cells or out are very slow; even 42k+/k+ exchange requires concurrent metabolism of glucose or arginine. metabolizing cells accumulate k+, establishing a concentration gradient of some 50,000. accumulation is prevented by reagents that block or short circuit the proton circulation, but  42k+/k+ exchange persists. in glycolyzing cells whose proton pump has been blocked with n,n'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, net uptake of k+ can be induced by imposing an artificial membrane potential, interior negative. net k+ efflux is also controlled by the interplay of atp and the proton circulation. addition of proton conductors to glycolyzing cells induces k+ efflux, but has no effect on starving cells; the rate of k+ efflux appears to be a function of the cells' atp  content. we conclude that k+ accumulation requires the cells to generate both a protonmotive force and atp. k+ uptake is electrogenic and attains a concentration gradient far too steep to be in equilibrium with the membrane potential. we consider two alternative models for k+ transport: a primary atp-driven pump regulated by the proton circulation or a secondary porter activated by atp that mediates symport of k+ with h+.

AB  == 1. the ability of streptococcus faecalis and streptococcus faecium strains to survive in egg albumen and liquid whole egg before and after laboratory pasteurisation was studied. 2. pasteurisation of egg albumen caused a decrease in viable cells of less than 10-fold, while pasteurisation of whole egg caused decreases of more than 100-fold in only two of the eight strains studied. after growth in whole egg, some strains were more resistant to pasteurisation in whole  egg. 3. strep. faecalis multiplied in raw and pasteurised whole egg but not in egg albumen. 4. strep. faecium multiplied in raw and pasteurised whole egg only after an initial decline in viability which was not shown by cells adapted to whole egg. together with storage temperature this affected the number of viable cells after a storage period of 5 d. 5. in raw and pasteurised egg albumen strep. faecium strains lost viability; this was maximal at 37 degrees c and more cells survived as the storage temperature decreased.

TI  == a novel mechanism of resistance to penicillin-gentamicin synergism in streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == a patient with enterococcal endocarditis, who relapsed after repeated courses of  apparently adequate treatment with ampicillin plus gentamicin, was subsequently cured with ampicillin-tobramycin therapy. the organisms isolated from this patient were strains of streptococcus faecalis that were resistant to penicillin  (or ampicillin)-gentamicin synergism but not to penicillin (or ampicillin)-tobramycin synergism. the mechanism of resistance in these strains appears to be related to a specific defect in the intracellular uptake of gentamicin (but not tobramycin) in the presence of penicillin.

TI  == ontogeny of the inflammatory response in the fetal rat.
AB  == fetal rats of 16, 17 and 18 days gestation (dg) were injected with turpentine or  streptococcus faecalis in 1% india ink. specimens of peritoneal tissues and exudates were collected at 24, 48 and 96 h after injection. inflammation was present in some of the youngest animals (16 dg) 24 h after injection with bacteria. the response consisted of infiltrates of polymorphonuclear (pmn) and mononuclear (mn) cells in tissues adjacent to the peritoneum. inflammatory cells  were also found within the peritoneal cavity. phagocytosis of ink particles and bacteria was noted in these cells and in cells of the serosa and adjacent mesenchyme. free peritoneal cells were not seen in littermate controls. phagocytosis was also noted in pmns and mns in the exudates collected at 48 h. a  more marked granulocytic response was seen in animals sacrificed 24 h following bacteria-ink injection at 17 dg. inflammation was more extensive and consistent by 19 dg. the reaction to turpentine was associated with the variable degree of tissue injury noted in histologic sections. the gestational age at time of injection was a more important determinant of the magnitude and character of response than was the duration of the lesion.

TI  == experimental endocarditis in rabbits. 3. significance of the proteolytic capacity of the infecting strains of streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == insertion of a polyethylene catheter into the left ventricle of the heart was used for regular establishment of sterile endocarditis, and bacterial endocarditis was established by injection of approximately 10(8) streptococcus faecalis into the blood stream at the same time as removal of the catheter which  had been in place for 3 days. 100 out of 102 rabbits died spontaneously of bacterial endocarditis. evidence is produced that the host-parasite interaction is influenced by the proteolytic property of s. faecalis in this experimental model. two distinct types of clinical course are described: 1) a predominantly acute and damaging illness, characterized by a high level of bacteraemia, small amounts of soft, friable vegetations in the left side of the heart, high frequency of kidney infarcts and shorter survival time in rabbits infected with proteolytic strains. 2) a relatively subacute illness, characterized by a lower level of bacteraemia, large, hard, non-friable vegetations on the aortic valves,  less pronounced destructive changes in the substance of valve leaflets, relatively lower frequency of kidney infarcts and longer survival time in rabbits infected with non-proteolytic strains. the results suggest that proteolytic strains of s. faecalis cause partial dissolution of the vegetations resulting in  a more severe clinical picture.

TI  == action and interaction of penicillin and gentamicin on enterococci.
AB  == the action and interaction of benzylpenicillin and gentamicin on streptococcus faecalis was studied using mainly turbidimetric methods. the minimum antibacterial concentration (mac) of each antibiotic lay considerably below the conventionally determined minimum inhibitory concentration, and levels of the two agents exceeding the mac were necessary in order to obtain a synergic interaction. evidence was obtained that gentamicin interfered with bacterial lysis induced by penicillin, and this suggests that the aminoglycoside is responsible for the bactericidal activity of the combination, the role of the penicillin being solely to facilitate access of the aminoglycoside to its target  site. our findings do not, however, fully support the generally held view that the increased permeability of enterococci to aminoglycosides is due to penicillin-induced cell wall damage. 'persisters'--cells surviving prolonged exposure to the optimum lethal concentration of penicillin--were not killed by subsequent exposure to gentamicin if the penicillin was removed but were killed if the penicillin remained present.

TI  == structure and properties of the putrescine carbamoyltransferase of streptococcus  faecalis.
AB  == ornithine and putrescine carbamoyltransferases from streptococcus faecalis atcc11700 have been purified and their structural properties compared. the molecular weight of native ornithine carbamoyltransferase, measured by molecular  sieving, is 250 000. it is composed of six apparently identical subunits with a molecular weight of 39 000, as determined by cross-linking with the bifunctional  reagent glutaraldehyde followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecylsulfate. using the same method, putrescine carbamoyltransferase is a trimer of 140 000 consisting of three identical subunits with a molecular weight of 40 000. ornithine carbamoyltransferase displays a narrow specificity towards its substrate, ornithine. in contrast, putrescine carbamoyltransferase carbamoylates ornithine and several diamines (diaminopropane, diaminohexane, spermine, spermidine, cadaverine) in addition to  its preferred substrate, putrescine, but with a considerable lower efficiency than for putrescine. the kinetic mechanism of putrescine carbamoyltransferase has been investigated. initial velocity studies yield intersecting plots using either putrescine or ornithine as substrate, indicating a sequential mechanism. the patterns of protection of the enzyme by the reactants during heat inactivation as well as the results of product and dead-end inhibition studies provide evidence for a random addition of the substrates. the putrescine inhibition that is induced by phosphate does, however, suggest that a preferred pathway exists in which carbamoylphosphate is the leading substrate. the different kinetic constants have been established. the properties of putrescine carbamoyltransferase are compared to the known properties of other carbamoyltransferases. the evolutionary implications of this comparison are discussed.

TI  == a resonance raman and electronic absorption probe of membrane energization. quinaldine red in cells of streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == resonance raman and electronic absorption spectra were used to show that the state of an amphiphilic cation, relative to dilute aqueous solution, changes when it is accumulated by cells of streptococcus faecalis when they are energized. the general characteristics of the cation employed, quinaldine red, closely paralleled those of other amphiphilic cations which have been used to measure membrane potential. a major aspect of the change is that in sodium-loaded cells,  essentially all of the quinaldine red accumulated as the result of energization forms a strong bond with an anionic group. this binding is similar to that which  occurs for the basal level of quinaldine red taken up in nonenergized cells. ionic binding was detected using resonance raman spectroscopy through shifts associated with a n+ parallel c--c parallel c stretching vibration to lower frequency on uptake. another aspect of the change in state is that the cell-localized probe cation can aggregate while ionically bonded in a card pack fashion, the transition dipoles being parallel. a combination of resonance raman  and electronic absorption spectroscopy was used to characterize this aggregation. the aggregates were estimated to contain at least five quinaldine red cations at  or near van der waals contact, and the presence of other molecules, such as phospholipids, could not be excluded. aggregation effects are complex depending on the ratio of cells to probe cation, and on energization. the site of binding is suggested to be the lipid bilayer region of the plasma membrane on the basis of experiments with liposomes and other model systems. in addition, some quinaldine red may be present in the cytoplasm in an aggregated, ionically bound  form. the change in state on uptake following energization seems to be associated with a membrane potential, similar spectral and uptake effects being produced by  an artificially generated membrane potential in cells and liposomes. the results  show that membrane potential cannot be computed in a simple manner from the distribution of quinaldine red between cells and medium, assuming that the thermodynamic activity coefficient of cell-localized material is identical with that in dilute aqueous solution. however, uptake as well as subsequent ionic binding of quinaldine red seems to be related to potential in an as yet undefined manner.

TI  == a study of the surface-active properties of the mg2+-activated atpase from cytoplasmic membranes of streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == the surface activity and enzymic properties of the factor f1, the catalytic moiety of streptococcus faecalis h+-atpase, has been studied at the air-water and phospholipid-water interfaces. f1 does not interact with the monolayer phospholipids, hence its adsorption on a biological membrane must be due mainly to its recognition of proteins of the hydrophobic complex. the dimensions of the  f1 molecule at the air-water interface have been estimated. in the presence of mg2+, base area is s = 1.8 . 10(4) a2, height h = 27 a. bearing in mind the size  of a globular subunit, it follows from the measurements that the major f1 subunits should all lie in the same plane. the atpase activity of f1 at the interface is inversely proportional to the monolayer density. with low density monolayer, the specific atpase activity is higher at the interface than in the bulk of the solution. adsorption of f1 at the interface shifts the isoelectric point of tiscussed relative to the proton-active transport mechanism.

AB  == normal sera and plasma, derived from humans, calves, rats, rabbits, horses, human synovial fluids, inflammatory exudates, and leukocyte extracts, when sufficiently diluted are highly bacteriolytic for staph, aureus, strep. faecalis, b. sutilis and to a variety of gram-negative rods. on the other hand, concentrated serum or  the other body fluids are usually not bacteriolytic for these bacterial species.  while the lysis of staph, aureus and b. subtilis by diluted serum is not lysozyme dependent, lysis of strep. faecalis is absolutely dependent on the concentration  of lysozyme. the lytic factor in human serum is present in cohn's fractions iii,  iv, and v. it is nondialyzable, resistant to heating for 75 degrees c and 20 min, and acts optimally at ph 5.0. like leukocyte extracts, synovial fluids, and inflammatory exudates, it lyses only young staphylococci. the inability of concentrated serum to lyse staph. aureus and strep. faecalis is due to the presence in the gamma globulin fraction of a potent inhibitor, which can be partly removed by dilution of by adsorption upon the homologous bacteria. lysis of the bacteria is also strongly inhibited by cohn's fraction ii (gamma globulin) by high-molecular-weight dna, heparin, liquoid, and histone. the possible role played by serum globulin in the protection of bacteria against degradation by leukocyte is discussed.

TI  == does penicillin kill bacteria?.
AB  == the thesis is presented that the bactericidal action of penicillin and of other inhibitors of cell wall peptidoglycan synthesis, such as vancomycin and cycloserine, is secondary or tertiary to their ability inhibit specific reactions in the assembly of an osmotically protective cell wall. examples are given of the inhibition of these reactions, which results in inhibition of cell growth (bacteriostatic action) in the absence of either cellular lysis or rapid loss of  viability. thus, in some instances, inhibitory concentrations of these drugs are, in effect, sublethal; this is true, for example, for streptococcus mutans, a species of bacteria that is part of the normal flora of the oropharynx and that can cause subacute bacterial endocarditis. on the other hand, the damaging effects of the subminimal inhibitory concentrations of penicillin g on streptococcus faecalis, a species with an active autolytic enzyme system, can be  uncovered and converted to a lytic (and lethal) response by partial inhibition of fatty acid synthesis with low concentrations of cerulenin. some theoretical and practical implications of the occurrence and inhibition of these secondary lethal consequences are discussed.

AB  == a study was carried out on the efficiency of certain rapid methods for the identification of streptococcal groups, especially groups b and d, methods based  upon physiologic properties such as hippurate hydrolysis, production of pigment,  esculin hydrolysis, tolerance to salt and bilolysis, associated with the classical tests, for instance the hemolysis type and sensitivity to bacitracin and optochin. by these tests, accessible to hospital laboratories, a number of 3083 streptococcal strains were correctly identified within 2 to 18 hours, of which 2567 group a, 31 group b, 184 group c, g, 113 group d, 155 str. pneumoniae  and 31 viridans, strains isolated from pathological products.

TI  == enzymatic deacylation of lipoteichoic acid by protoplasts of streptococcus faecium (streptococcus faecalis atcc 9790).
AB  == high-molecular-weight, micellar lipoteichoic acid (lta) was converted to a lower-molecular-weight, apparently deacylated polymer when the former was incubated in the presence of growing protoplasts of streptococcus faecium (s. faecalis atcc 9790), but not when incubated in fresh or spent protoplast medium.  the mobility of the low-molecular-weight polymer upon agarose gel electrophoresis was indistinguishable from that of native extracellular lipoteichoic acid lta(x)  from this organism or from chemically deacylated lta. native lta(x) was shown to  contain less than one fatty acid equivalent per 18 lta(x) molecules, in contrast  to the 4:1 ratio of fatty acids to polyglycerolphosphate chains in micellar lta.

TI  == the chediak-higashi syndrome: quantitation of a deficiency in maximal bactericidal capacity.
AB  == the maximum bactericidal capacity of neutrophils from a patient with the chediak-higashi syndrome (chs) was measured by a quantitative assay in which the  neutrophils were challenged with increasing multiples of staphylococcus aureus, 502a. at various bacterial challenges from 0.5 to 65 bacteria per neutrophil, the chs cells killed normal numbers of bacteria in 60 minutes. however, at higher ratios with a mean of 118 bacteria per neutrophil, the percentage of bacteria killed in 60 minutes by chs neutrophils (8.1 +/- 2.3%) was significantly less (p  < 0.001) than that killed by normal neutrophils (44 +/- 2.3%). the chs neutrophils lagged in their ability to kill low challenges of bacteria (0.5 or 1.2 bacteria per neutrophil) only at 20 minutes. a hydrogen-peroxide-producing strain of streptococcus faecalis was killed normally by the chs neutrophils at 60 minutes, with all ratios of challenge up to 114 to 1. electron microscopic examination of 60-minute specimens from high ratios of challenge that were stained for myeloperoxidase activity revealed a failure of many bacteria-laden phagosomes to display this marker of degranulation. the results of this study indicate that the maximal bactericidal capacity of chs neutrophils is saturated by a significantly lower challenge of bacteria than is required to saturate normal cells. this appears to be the result of sequestration of a significant portion of these cells' bactericidal resources in the giant granules that do not  participate appreciably in degranulation.

TI  == aeration sensitizes streptococcus faecalis to hydroxyurea.
AB  == hydroxyurea in up to 60 mm concentration did not inhibit growth or dna synthesis  in nonaerated cultures of streptococcus faecalis atcc 8043. in contrast, in cultures aerated by shaking already 1 mm hydroxyurea decreased the rate of net dna synthesis and in higher concentrations of the drug the growth of the total cell mass also slowed down and the number of cells per chain increased from 1-2 to 10. the differential rate of dna synthesis, but not the growth of the total cell mass, could be restored almost to the control level by adding thymidine to the medium. thus there are at least two targets for hydroxyurea in the cells of s. faecalis grown in aerated cultures.

AB  == insertion of a polyethylene catheter in the left side of the heart was used to induce sterile endocarditis in 34 rabbits. bacterial endocarditis was established by injection of approximately 10(8) streptococcus faecalis into the blood stream  simultaneous with the removal of the catheter which had been in place for 3 days. the course of the bacterial endocarditis was examined by autopsy of rabbits sacrificed at regular intervals after the infection. the results showed that the  presence of the catheter was not essential for the induction or maintenance of the infection. growth of the bacteria took place in the preformed vegetations in  the aorta, on the aortic valves and in the left ventricle. however, increases in  the size of the vegetations, a high density of bacteria in the vegetations and secondary spreading were found only on the aortic valves. the extracardial manifestations of left-sided s. faecalis endocarditis included constant bacteriaemia, a high frequency of septic kidney infarcts and enlargement of the spleen. this form of experimentally provoked bacterial endocarditis in rabbits provides a good imitation of human subacute endocarditis, and would thus seem to  be suitable for further study of the pathophysiology of endocarditis and evaluation of the effect of treatment with antibiotics.

AB  == a patient with endocarditis due to streptococcus faecalis on an aortic valvular prosthesis was successfully treated using large oral doses of amoxicillin concurrently with intramuscular administration of streptomycin. oral therapy was  employed because of a persistent reaction to intravenously administered antibiotics. oral therapy for bacterial endocarditis occurring on an artificial valve may be attempted as a last resort when all other accepted therapeutic measures have failed.

TI  == aminoglycoside-inactivating enzymes in clinical isolates of streptococcus faecalis. an explanation for resistance to antibiotic synergism.
AB  == clinical isolates of enterococci (streptococcus faecalis) with high-level resistance to both streptomycin and kanamycin (minimal inhibitory concentration >2,000 mug/ml), and resistant to synergism with penicillin and streptomycin or kanamycin were examined for aminoglycoside-inactivating enzymes. all of the 10 strains studied had streptomycin adenylyltransferase and neomycin phosphotransferase activities; the latter enzyme phosphorylated amikacin as well  as its normal substrates, such as kanamycin. substrate profiles of the neomycin phosphotransferase activity suggested that phosphorylation occurred at the 3'-hydroxyl position, i.e., aminoglycoside 3'-phosphotransferase. a transconjugant strain, which acquired high-level aminoglycoside resistance and resistance to antibiotic synergism after mating with a resistant clinical isolate, also acquired both enzyme activities. quantitative phosphorylation of amikacin in vitro by a sonicate of the transconjugant strain inactivated the antibiotic, as measured by bioassay, and the phosphorylated drug failed to produce synergism when combined with penicillin against a strain sensitive to penicillin-amikacin synergism.no differences were found in the sensitivity of ribosomes from a sensitive and resistant strain when examined in vitro using polyuridylic acid directed [(14)c]-phenylalanine incorporation in the presence of streptomycin, kanamycin, or amikacin. therefore, we conclude that aminoglycoside-inactivating enzymes are responsible for the aminoglycoside resistance, and resistance to antibiotic synergism observed in these strains.

TI  == accumulation of thallous ions (tl+) as a measure of the electrical potential difference across the cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria.
AB  == the accumulation of thallous ions (204tl+) by intact bacteria was investigated. i conclude that tl+ is a permeant cation, and that it therefore accumulates in response to the electrical potential difference (delta psi) across the cytoplasmic membrane (interior negative). a comparison with other methods shows that the distribution ratio of 204tl+ serves as a reasonably satisfactory method  for measuring the membrane potential of streptococcus faecalis. glycolyzing cells of this organism develop membrane potentials of up to 180 mv. preliminary experiments with escherichia coli, especially those with a mutant defective in the proton-translocating atpase, indicate that the tl+ distribution also serves as a measure of the membrane potential in this organism. the particular advantage of tl+ over other indicators of the membrane potential is that the cells need not be pretreated in any way. by use of the tl+ distribution, it was calculated that  respiring cells of e. coli develop a membrane potential of 160 mv with d-lactate  and 180 mv with glucose as a substrate, respectively.

AB  == resistance plasmids isolated from streptococcus agalactiae (group b) and s. faecalis (group d) have been compared in regard to resistance markers, molecular  weight, and dna-dna homology. three of them (pip501, pip612, and pip613) have been found to confer identical (or very similar) resistance patterns (erythromycin, lincomycin, and streptogramin b, respectively) and to have similar molecular weights (19.8 x 10(6), 22.7 x 10(6), and 17.6 x 10(6), respectively) and a high level of dna-dna homology in hybridization experiments (90 to 100%). these results are compatible with the view that these plasmids may derive from one common ancestor, and/or that they can be transferred between unrelated streptococcus strains belonging to the same or different groups.

TI  == induced cell aggregation and mating in streptococcus faecalis: evidence for a bacterial sex pheromone.
AB  == recipient strains of streptococcus faecalis produce a trypsin sensitive, heat resistant, nuclease resistant factor, designated clumping-inducing agent (cia) which causes strains carrying certain conjugative plasmids to aggregate. rna and  protein synthesis but not dna synthesis are required for aggregation to occur. recipient filtrates that contain cia activity also induce donors to mate at high  frequencies. introduction of a transferable plasmid into strains producing cia dramatically reduces the amount of cia activity produced by the strain but allows the strain to respond to exogenously added cia. our data suggest that cia represents a bacterial sex hormone (pheromone).

AB  == helium at pressures of 20 to 70 atm in the presence of air found to stimulate growth of streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus, mainly by increasing the rate of exponential growth. however, at these same pressures, helium potentiated the growth-inhibitory actions of oxygen and nitrous oxide (n2o). oxygen was found to act essentially as an anesthetic gas in inhibiting growth of s. faecalis; its potency was approximately the same as that  of n2o, and it acted additively in combination with n2o to inhibit the streptococcus. oxygen proved to be more potent than n2o in inhibiting the growth  of e. coli and s. aureus, and each gas potentiated the action of the other. oxygen sensitivity was correlated with n2o sensitivity. overall, our findings indicate that bacterial growth inhibition by anesthetic gases does not accurately reflect narcotic action.

TI  == approximation of the cell cycle in synchronized populations of streptococcus faecium.
AB  == slowly growing populations (td = 70 to 80 min) of streptococcus faecium (s. faecalis atcc 9790) were synchronized by selection after sucrose gradient fractionation. the cell cycle was approximated by correlating the patterns of dna accumulation and cell division. more specifically, the beginning of cell cycle was equated with the beginning of a rapid linear increase in dna accumulation. the dna content of the culture approximately doubled during the period of accumulation, which lasted about 51 min. the period of rapid dna accumulation, was followed by a period of reduced accumulation that lasted about 24 min. during synchronized growth, cell numbers increased rapidly in coordination with the period of rapid dna accumulation and exhibited a plateau during the period of reduced dna accumulation. in contrast, rna and protein appeared to accumulate exponentially throughout the cell cycle at the same rate as culture mass.

TI  == relationship between cellular autolytic activity, peptidoglycan synthesis, septation, and the cell cycle in synchronized populations of streptococcus faecium.
AB  == synchronized, slowly growing (td = 70 to 80 min) cultures were used to study several wall-associated parameters during the cell cycle: rate of peptidoglycan synthesis, septation, and cellular autolytic activity. the rate of peptidoglycan  synthesis per cell declined during most of the period of chromosome replication (c), but increased during the latter part of c and into the period between chromosome termination and cell division (d). an increase in cellular septation was correlated with the increased rate of peptidoglycan synthesis. cellular autolytic capacity increased during the early portion of c, reached a maximum late in c or early in d, and declined during d. inhibition of dna synthesis during c prevented the decline in autolytic capacity at the end of the cell cycle, caused a slight reduction in the rate of peptidoglycan synthesis, delayed  but did not prevent septation, and prevented the impending cell division by inhibiting cell separation. inhibition of dna synthesis during d did not prevent  the increase in autolytic capacity during the next c phase, but, once again, prevented the decline at the end of the subsequent cycle. thus, increased autolytic capacity at the beginning of the cell cycle did not seem to be related  to chromosome initiation, whereas decreased autolytic capacity at the end of the  cell cycle seemed to be related to chromosome termination. the data presented are consistent with the role of autolytic enzyme activity in the previously proposed  model for cell division of s. faecium (g.d. shockman et al., ann. n.y acad. sci.  235:161-197, 1974).

TI  == beta-d-phosphogalactoside galactohydrolase of streptococcus faecalis and the inhibition of its synthesis by glucose.
AB  == the lactose hydrolysing system of streptococcus faecalis is described. it is closely related to that one of the group n streptocci as it consists of a beta-d-phosphogalactoside galactohydrolase (beta-pgal). the uptake of methyl-beta-d-thiogalactoside (tmg), lactose, and glucose is maintained by the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (pts) but the uptake of galactose is not. the induction time is 6--7 min. inducers are lactose and galactose but not isopropyl-beta-d-galactoside (iptg) and tmg. in the presence of glucose, mannose, and maltose no induction of beta-pgal occurs but pyruvate and glycerol allow induction. the competitive inhibition of uptake of tmg by glucose  suggests inducer exclusion by this sugar. tmg accumulates in the cells exclusively as a derivative.

TI  == plasmid-mediated mechanisms of resistance to aminoglycoside-aminocyclitol antibiotics and to chloramphenicol in group d streptococci.
AB  == genes conferring resistance to aminoglycoside-aminocyclitol antibiotics in three  group d streptococcal strains, streptococcus faecalis jh1 and jh6 and s. faecium  jh7, and to chloramphenicol in jh6 are carried by plasmids that can transfer to other s. faecalis cells. the aminoglycoside resistance is mediated by constitutively synthesized phosphotransferase enzymes that have substrate profiles very similar to those of aminoglycoside phosphotransferases found in gram-negative bacteria. phosphorylation probably occurs at the aminoglycoside 3'-hydroxyl group. plasmid-borne streptomycin resistance is due to production of  the enzyme streptomycin adenylyltransferase, which, as in staphylococci and in contrast to that detected in gram-negative bacteria, is less effective against spectinomycin as substrate. resistance to chloramphenicol is by enzymatic acetylation. the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase is inducible and bears a close resemblance to the type d chloramphenicol acetyltransferase variant from staphylococci.

TI  == superoxide dismutase and oxygen metabolism in streptococcus faecalis and comparisons with other organisms.
AB  == streptococcus faecalis contains a single superoxide dismutase that has been purified to homogeneity with a 55% yield. this enzyme has a molecular weight of 45,000 and is composed of two subunits of equal size. it contains 1.3 atoms of manganese per molecule. its amino acid composition was determined and is compared with that for the superoxide dismutases from escherichia coli, streptococcus mutans, and mycobacterium lepraemurium. when used as an antigen in rabbits, the s. faecalis enzyme elicited the formation of a precipitating and inhibiting antibody. this antibody cross-reacted with the superoxide dismutase present in another strain of s. faecalis, but neither inhibited nor precipitated the superoxide dismutases in a wide range of other bacteria, including several other  streptococci, such as s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, and s. lactis. the inhibiting antibody was used to suppress the superoxide dismutase activity present in cell extracts of s. faecalis and thus allow the demonstration that 17% of the total oxygen consumption by such extracts, in the presence of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, was associated with the production of o(2) (-). a variety of bacterial species were surveyed for their content of superoxide dismutases. the iron-containing enzyme was distinguished from the manganese-containing enzyme through the use of h(2)o(2), which inactivates the former more readily than the latter. some of the bacteria appeared to contain only the iron enzyme, others only the manganese enzyme, and still others both. indeed, some had multiple, electrophoretically distinct superoxide dismutases in both categories. there was  no discernible absolute relationship between the types of superoxide dismutases in a particular organism and their gram-stain reaction.

AB  == the autolytic capacity of streptococcus faecium (s. faecalis atcc 9790) varied during synchronous cell division. this phenomenon was initially observed in rapidly dividing populations (td=30 to 33 min) synchronized by a combination of induction and size selection techniques. to minimize the problems inherent in studies of cells containing overlapping chromosome cycles and possible artifacts  generated by induction techniques, the autolytic capacities of slowly dividing populations (td=60 to 110 min) synchronized by selection only were examined. although the overall level of cellular autolytic capacity was observed to decline with decreasing growth rate, sharp, periodic fluctuations in cellular autolytic capacity were seen during synchronous growth at all growth rates examined. on the basis of similar patterns of cyclic fluctuations in autolytic capacity of cultures synchronized by (i) selection, (ii) amino acid starvation followed by size selection, and (iii) amino acid starvation followed by inhibition of dna synthesis, a link of such fluctuations with the cell division cycle has been postulated.

TI  == autolytic defective mutant of streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == properties of a variant of streptococcus faecalis atcc 9790 with defective cellular autolysis are described. the mutant strain was selected as a survivor from a mutagenized cell population simultaneously challenged with two antibiotics which inhibit cell wall biosynthesis, penicillin g and cycloserine. compared to the parental strain, the mutant strain exhibited: (i) a thermosensitive pattern of cellular autolysis; (ii) an autolytic enzyme activity that had only a slightly increased thermolability when tested in solution in the absence of wall substrate; and (iii) an isolated autolysin that had hydrolytic activity on isolated s. faecalis wall substrate indistinguishable from that of the parental strain, but that was inactive when tested on walls of micrococcus lysodeikticus as a substrate. these data indicate an alteration in the substrate specificity of the autolytic enzyme of the mutant which appears to result from the synthesis of  an altered form of autolytic enzyme.

TI  == effect of cerulenin on streptococcus faecalis macromolecular synthesis and cell division.

TI  == activation of the alternate complement pathway by peptidoglycan from streptococcal cell wall.
AB  == activation of the alternate complement pathway in human serum by several bacterial components was compared. peptidoglycan from group a streptococcal cell  walls was the most active material, on a weight basis, followed by cell walls, protoplast membranes, and whole cells. the group-specific carbohydrate was inactive. treatment of peptidoglycan with low concentrations of lysozyme or short periods of sonic treatment enhanced complement activation. high concentrations of lysozyme or extended sonic treatment of peptidoglycan destroyed or greatly reduced the capacity to activate complement. lysozyme treatment of group a streptococcal cell walls or lipopolysaccharide had no measurable effect. activation of the alternate complement pathway by group d streptococcal cell walls was destroyed by lysozyme. activity of peptidoglycan was not inhibited by n-acetyl glucosamine, n-acetyl muramic acid, or d-alanine-d-alanine. conversion of c3 and factored b by peptidoglycan was shown to occur by immunoelectrophoresis and crossed immunoelectrophoresis.

TI  == structural arrangement of polymers within the wall of streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == the structure of the cell wall of streptococcus faecalis was studied in thin sections and freeze fractures of whole cells and partially purified wall fractions. also, the structures of wall preparations treated with hot trichloroacetic acid to remove non-peptidoglycan wall polymers were compared with wall preparations that possess a full complement of accessory polymers. the appearance of the wall varied with the degree of hydration of preparations and physical removal of the cell membrane from the wall before study. seen in freeze  fractures of whole cells, the fully hydrated wall seemed to be a thick, largely amorphic layer. breaking cells with beads caused the cell membrane to separate from the wall and transformed the wall from a predominantly amorphic layer to a structure seemingly made up of two rows of "cobblestones" enclosing a central channel of lower density. dehydration of walls seemingly caused the cobblestones  to be transformed into two bands which continued to be separated by a channel. this channel was also observed in isolated wall preparations treated with hot trichloroacetic acid to remove non-peptidoglycan polymers. these observations are consistent with the interpretation that both peptidogylcan and non-peptidoglycan  polymers are concentrated at the outer and inner surfaces of cell walls. these observations are discussed in relation to possible models of wall structure and assembly.

TI  == generation rates of faecal streptococci in various vehicles.
AB  == potassium tellurite media gave the highest detrimental effects on the generation  number of all tested faecal streptococci species. this applies to all investigated vehicles. however, drastic tellurite effects became more conspicuous with certain vehicles than with others. this is particularly true with acid and alkaline foods and water, especially with strains like streptococcus bovis, str.  faecium, and str. durans. again, tellurite becomes more influencial with regard to old cells rather than young cells in the logarithmic phase. on the other hand, the use of thallous acetate as a concentration agent secured better results than  either the tellurite or azide almost with all tested vehicles. yet, sodium azide  may be regarded as holding an intermediate position between tellurite and thallous acetate in terms of vehicles, streptococcus species, and age of pollution. a lower number of generation resulted with all tested faecal streptococci species, using liquid media bearing more than one concentrating agent. this applied to water and milk examination.

TI  == interactions between beta-lactam antibiotics and isolated membranes of streptococcus faecalis atcc 9790.
AB  == the dd-carboxypeptidase-exchange membrane-bound enzyme in streptococcus faecalis  atcc 9790 reacts with beta-lactam antibiotics to form complexes with rather long  half-lives. depending upon the antibiotic, the second-order rate constants for complex formation range from 0.75-560 m-1 s-1 (at 37 degrees c and in water) and  the first-order rate constants for complex breakdown range from 1.3 to 26 x 10(-5) s-1 (at 37 degrees c and in 5 mm phosphate buffer ph 7.5). there are about 30 pmol of dd-carboxypeptidase-exchange enzyme per mg of membrane protein. the degradation products arising from benzylpenicillin are phenylacetylglycine and probably n-formyl-d-penicillamine. isolated membranes also contain other penicillin binding sites (about 70 pmol/mg membrane protein). that part of benzylpenicillin which reacts with at least some of these latter sites is slowly  degraded into penicilloic acid. normal functioning of the dd-carboxypeptidase-exchange membrane-bound enzyme is important, if not essential, for cell growth. with the beta-lactam antibiotics tested inhibition of cell growth is mainly related to the rates of formation of the inactive enzyme-antibiotic complexes. the relationship, however, is not a direct one probably due to the competitive effect exerted by the other penicillin binding sites.

TI  == evaluation of a new presumptive medium for group d streptococci.
AB  == a new medium designated as d streptococcus-enterococcus broth was formulated and  evaluated for the enrichment and isolation of strains of serological group d streptococci. this medium was made by modifying todd-hewitt broth. most-probable-number multiple-tube and membrane filter techniques were employed to estimate the numbers of enterococci in known cultures, wastewater, and other samples. preliminary most-probable-number counts with this medium were as much as 3 logs higher than those counts obtained from four other media with which it was  compared. the methodology for using this medium to estimate the numbers of group  d streptococci in water is discussed.

TI  == serum folates in man.
AB  == in an aseptic microbiological assay of folate compounds and their breakdown compounds, using lactobacillus casei, streptococcus faecalis, and pediococcus cerevisiae, 4a-hydroxy-5methyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrofolate and 5-methyl-5,8-dihydrofolate were inactive under all conditions to all three organisms and 5-methyl-5,6-dihydrofolate was inactive unless ascorbate was present in the incubation medium, and then only to l. casei. 5-methyltetrahydrofolate was active only for l. casei, and activity in purified samples to s. faecalis was due to trace amounts of folic acid. analysis of s. faecalis values in the serum in normal subjects and in patients with various disorders showed that levels of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate are raised in coeliac disease, leukaemia, rheumatoid arthritis, and schizophrenia. 5-methyltetrahydrofolate is readily absorbed by normal human subjects and by patients with pernicious anaemia but poorly absorbed by patients with coeliac disease or leukaemia. 5-methyl-5,6-dihydrofolate was quickly absorbed by normal human subjects, being reflected by a considerably raised level of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate in serum when sodium bicarbonate was given by mouth before the 5-methyl-5,6-dihydrofolate. these higher levels were comparable to those in patients with pernicious anaemia after oral administration of 5-methyl-5,6-dihydrofolate. oral 5-methyl-5,8-dihydrofolate and 4a-hydroxy-5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate did not appear as microbiologically active folates in the serum. the findings of this study suggest that the availability for biological utilisation of the major dietary folate compounds will depend on the amount of gastric acidity and of ascorbate in the intestinal chyme. many may  be unavailable for metabolic utilization in the body.

TI  == antimicrobial systems of the surgical wound. ii. detection of antimicrobial protein in cell-free wound fluid.
AB  == human wound fluid contains heat-stable proteins with moderate antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli, and different heat-labile proteins with antibacterial activity against e coli. blood serum also contains heat-labile antibacterial substances, but little heat-stable activity against staphylococcus aureus. both blood serum and wound fluid have bacteriostatic activity against s epidermidis, and early growth of streptococcus  fecalis occurs in serum and wound fluids. the concentration or activity of antimicrobial proteins increases during the first week in the fresh wound and then decreases as the wound matures.

TI  == energetics of streptococcal growth inhibition by hydrostatic pressure.
AB  == growth of streptococcus faecalis in complex media with various fuel sources appeared to be limited by the rate of supply of adenosine-5' -triphosphate (atp)  at 1 atm and also under 408 atm of hydrostatic pressure. growth under pressure was energetically inefficient, as indicated by an average cell yield for exponentially growing cultures of only 10.7 g (dry weight) per mol of atp produced compared with a 1-atm value of 15.6. use of atp for pressure-volume work or for turnover of protein, peptidoglycan, or stable ribonucleic acid (rna) did not appear to be significant causes of growth inefficiency under pressure. in addition, there did not seem to be an increased atp requirement for ion uptake because cells growing at 408 atm had significantly lower internal k(+) levels than did those growing at 1 atm. pressure did stimulate the membrane adenosine triphosphatase (atpase) or s. faecalis at atp concentrations greater than 0.5 mm. intracellular atp levels were found to vary during the culture cycle from about 2.5 mumol/ml of cytoplasmic water for lag-phase or stationary-phase cells to maxima for exponentially growing cells of about 7.5 mumol/ml at 1 atm and 5.5 mumol/ml at 408 atm. n,n'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide at a 10 mum concentration improved growth efficiency under pressure, as did mg(2+) or ca(2+) ions at 50 mm  concentration. these agents also enhanced atp pooling, and it seemed that at least part of the growth inefficiency under pressure was due to increased atpase  activity. in all, it appeared that s. faecalis growing under pressure has somewhat reduced atp supply but significantly increased demand and that the inhibitory effects of pressure can be interpreted largely in terms of atp supply  and demand.

TI  == aminoglycoside-resistant enterococci.
AB  == thirty-four recent clinical isolates of streptococcus faecalis were tested for sensitivity to amoxycillin, benzylpenicillin, streptomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin. amoxycillin was two- to four-fold more active than benzylpenicillin and all strains were inhibited by low concentrations of the penicillins. the aminoglycosides were less active against the enterococci  than were the penicillins and a significant number of strains were insensitive or relatively insensitive to one or more of the aminoglycosides. thus, eight (23%) strains showed a high level of resistance to streptomycin and kanamycin (mic greater 5000 microng/ml) but were sensitive to gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin. in addition, two strains of strep. faecalis, isolated at different hospitals from patients who had received topical gentamicin therapy, were relatively resistant to gentamicin (mic250 to 500 microng/ml) and were less sensitive also to the other aminoglycosides. bactericidal synergy was demonstrated by amoxycillin/aminoglycoside combinations against the enterococci,  provided that the test strain of strep. faecalis was sensitive to the aminoglycoside in the combination. an exception to this was the combination of amoxycillin plus amikacin which was not synergistic against kanamycin-resistant strains of strep. faecalis although these organisms were sensitive to amikacin in the growth inhibition tests. the gentamicin-resistant strains showed variable responses to amoxycillin/aminoglycoside combinations in tests for bactericidal synergy and were generally less sensitive than typical strains of strep. faecalis.

TI  == teichoic acids of group d streptococci with special reference to strains from pig meningitis (streptococcus suis).
AB  == immunoelectrophoresis revealed in phenol extracts from s. faecalis and s. faecium a mixture of free and lipid-bound teichoic acids, both reactive with group d antisera. in phenol extracts from s. suis only lipid-bound teichoic acid, also reactive with group d antiserum, was seen. this difference probably accounts for  the low yield of group d antigen from s. suis as compared with s. faecalis and s. faecium when heating at ph 2 is used for extraction. when phenol is used good yields are obtained from s. suis as well as from s. faecalis and s. faecium. lipoteichoic acids from s. faecalis and s. faecium have a backbone structure the  same as or similar to that of group a streptococcal teichoic acid. lipoteichoic acid from s. suis has a structure differing from that of s. faecalis and s. faecium, e.g., possibly in the attachment of its glucosyl substituents. precipitation reactions between s. suis lipoteichoic acid and group d antisera were specifically inhibited by glucose. reactions between s. bovis phenol extracts and some group d antisera were also specifically inhibited by glucose, but extracts from s. faecalis and s. faecium were not. this may indicate a monosaccharide glucosyl substituent in teichoic acid from s. suis and s. bovis instead of the di- or trisaccharide previously postulated as the glucosyl substituent in the teichoic acid of s. faecalis.

TI  == transport and metabolism of vitamin b6 in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == streptococcus faecalis 8043 concentrates extracellular [3h]pyridoxal or [3h]pyridoxamine primarily as the corresponding 5'-phosphates. accumulation of pyridoxamine requires an exogenous energy source and is inhibited by glycolysis inhibitors. a membrane potential is not required for transport of pyridoxamine, and an artificially generated potential does not drive uptake in this organism. based on this and other evidence, it is concluded that s. faecalis accumulates pyridoxamine by facilitated diffusion in conjunction with trapping by pyridoxal kinase. pyridoxamine-p is not concentrated, but equilibrates with that provided externally. lactobacillus casei 7469 concentrates radioactivity only from pyridoxal, which appears internally as pyridoxal-p, suggesting that it too absorbs the vitamin by facilitated diffusion plus trapping. the specificity of the growth requirement of s. faecalis and l. casei for vitamin b6 parallels the specificity of the transport systems for this vitamin in these organisms. lactobacillus delbrueckii 7469, however, which specifically requires pyridoxamine-p or pyridoxal-p for growth, accumulates both these compounds and pyridoxine-p from the medium, apparently by active transport, but not pyridoxine, pyridoxamine, or pyridoxal. while pyridoxal-p and pyridoxamine-p are interconvertible in this organism, pyridoxine-p is not further metabolized, thus  accounting for the specificity of the growth requirement. these and previous results show (a) that different organisms may employ quite different transport machinery in utilization of a given external nutrient, and (b) that the specificity of the growth requirement for a given form of a vitamin frequently arises from the specificity of transport, but that internal metabolism of the compounds also plays a significant role in some organisms.

((1972) j. membrane biol. 8, 27-44 and 45-62). while they determined the dda+  concentration in the medium by measuring the absorbance of the filtrate treated with the ion-exchangers, the electrode can measure directly the dda+ concentration in the bacterial suspension without any any pretreatment. it was also shown that the electrode can measure the dda+ uptake in mitochondria during  energization.

TI  == sorption of streptococci to glass: effects of macromolecular solutes.
AB  == macromolecular solutes (albumin, concanavalin a, whole saliva, serum) caused impaired sorption of streptococcus faecium and streptococcus sanguis to glass. the inhibitory effect resided chiefly with interactions of the solutes with the glass surface. in the case of sorption of s. sanguis to glass in the presence of  parotid fluid, the inhibitory effect was counteracted by a specific attachment of s. sanguis cells mediated by some component(s) of the parotid fluid. agglutination of the test organisms was in general accompanied by inhibition of sorption. however, when small or unstable aggregates were formed, the number of cells adhering on the glass surface was increased. the findings are discussed with reference to the colonization of teeth by oral bacteria.

TI  == sorption of streptococcus faecium to glass.
AB  == a method has been developed by which to study the sorption of streptococcus faecium to soda-lime cover glasses. conditions were chosen to minimize the influence on sorption of bacterial polymer production, passive sorption being studied rather than attachment mediated by metabolic activities. sorption of s. faecium increased with increasing temperature (to 50 degrees c), time, and cell concentration, but equilibrium apparently was not reached even after incubation for 8 hours or at a cell concentration of 3 x 10(10) per ml. sorption increased with solute molarity up to 0.1 m concentration of nacl and kcl, indicating an effect of the electrical double layers on the apposition of cells to the glass surface. desorption of bacteria could be obtained after multiple washings of the  glasses in buffer or by the action of tween 80, but not if sorbed bacteria were left in distilled water, various salt solutions, urea, or in suspensions of unlabelled bacteria. it was concluded that sorption occurred as a result of chemical interactions between the glass and the cell surface. tween 80 at a concentration of 1 per cent inhibited sorption to 26 per cent of buffer controls, 2 m urea was less effective, and 1 m nacl was without effect. it is suggested that hydrophobic interactions may be of importance in the binding of s. faecium to glass.

AB  == the multi-drug-resistant strain streptococcus faecalis bio-4r was studied to see  if it carried a plasmid responsible for antibiotic resistance. from results indicating that the antibiotic resistance of s. faecalis bio-4r was not transferred to recipient bacteria, that the organism did not produce enzymes which inactivated antibiotics, and that the presence of covalently closed circular dna was not demonstrated by dye-cesium chloride buoyant density gradient centrifugation, it was concluded that the organism did not carry such a plasmid.  studies on polyphenylalanine synthesis by cell-free extracts of the oganism showed that its ribosomes were resistant to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, streptomycin and kanamycin. these results, although rather indirectly, support the above notion that the multi-drug-resistance of s. faecalis bio-4r is not mediated by a plasmid.

TI  == identification and characterization of a small sequence located at two sites on the amplifiable tetracycline resistance plasmid pamalpha1 in streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == streptococcus faecalis dt-11 harbors the 6.0-megadalton plasmid pamalpha1, which  determines resistance to tetracycline (tc). when this strain is grown in the presence of tc for a number of generations, a reversible gene amplification occurs, generating tandem repeats of a 2.65-megadalton segment of the plasmid. on the basis of heteroduplex studies between various forms of pamalpha1 and fragments generated by the escherichia coli restriction endonuclease ecori, we have obtained direct evidence for the presence of a small sequence designated rs1 (for recombination sequence) located on both sides of the tc resistance determinant. corresponding points on the two sequences are separated by 2.65 megadaltons of deoxyribonucleic acid. the two rs1 sequences have the same polarity and are of a size corresponding to about 380 nucleotide base pairs. the  data presented serve as strong support for amplification models that are based on recombinational events involving the rs1 sequences.

AB  == the microbiological, clinical and therapeutic aspects of all (71) cases of bacterial endocarditis admitted to the hopital cantonal, geneva, between august 1970 and october 1974 were reviewed: there was a definite trend towards higher prevalence of acute cases compared to subacute cases. the pathogenic role of s. epidermidis, mostly in cases of prosthetic valve endocarditis, could be demonstrated in several cases. when defined initially by microbiological criteria only, acute endocarditis were characterized by rapid evolution, destruction of the valvular structures (especially aortic valve), and by further evolution under adequate antibiotic therapy: thus, 10/25 patients with acute endocarditis died, whereas the mortality rate in the subacute cases was only 10/46. many cases in our series showed one or more often frequent embolic phenomena: 70% of the cured  cases and 80% of the patients with a fatal outcome. an unfavorable evolution could be correlated with neurologic involvement, cardiac rhythm or conduction disturbances, and/or heart failure; indeed, heart failure due to various mechanisms was the single most frequent cause of death and is presently the main  therapeutic problem. thus, acute infection leading to destruction of the aortic valve and to heart failure still carries a bad prognosis, even if emergency valve replacement is attempted. finally, 22/30 patients who developed a bacterial endocarditis after oral or urological procedures knew about a heart murmur, but did not receive antibiotic prophylaxis. this clearly shows that emphasis should be put on the elaboration and diffusion of adequate prophylactic regimens.

AB  == recent investigations on the aspartate transcarbamylases (carbamoylphosphate:l-aspartate carbamoyltransferase, ec 2.1.3.2) of escherichia  coli and streptococcus faecalis indicate that there is a site on each enzyme, apart from the active site, at which anions can bind. it is suggested in this paper that the location of such an anion binding site on the e. coli enzyme may be directly adjacent to the part of the active site at which carbamyl phosphate binds. this hypothesis is based on data demonstrating a lack of correlation between spectral changes and kinetic effects, and on a new interpretation of results obtained with n-(phosphonacetyl)-l-aspartate, which has previously been considered to act as a transition state analogue. such a hypothesis could explain other puzzling observations made on the catalytic subunit of this enzyme, including the dependence of substrate inhibition by aspartate on the nature of the second substrate, and the ease of formation of a dead-end enzyme-aspartate-carbamyl-aspartate complex.

TI  == a rapid, simple method for demonstrating synergy of amikacin and penicillin against various microorganisms.
AB  == a simple disk diffusion technique with use of triple-layer agar and enzymatic inactivation of penicillin demonstrated synergy between penicillins and aminoglycosides. the method was applied to measurement of the synergistic activity of amikacin and penicillin g against a strain of streptococcus faecalis  sensitive to both drugs, amikacin and ampicillin against a strain of s. faecalis  sensitive to amplicillin but resistant to amikacin, and amikacin and carbenicillin against a strain of proteus mirabilis sensitive to both drugs. the  degree of synergy was related to the specific organism tested. for example, syngery of penicillin g and amikacin for s. faecalis could be demonstrated only when the organism was subjected first to the action of penicillin g alone. in addition to providing useful clinical information, the triple-layer technique appears to be a promising tool for the study and understanding of synergy between antimicrobial agents.

AB  == a comparative study of ultrastructure and ir-spectroscopy of osmotic shock membranes from cells of glycolyzing (streptococcus faecalis) and respiring (micrococcus lysodeikticus) bacteria, was made. the s. faecalis and m. lysodeikticus membranes differ in their cross-section. treatment of the preliminary washed membranes of s. faecalis and m. lysodeikticus with a low ionic strength solution removes 40% and 70% of their proteins respectively, decreases the membrane cross-section but does not change their fracture faces. pre-cooling  of the membrane suspensions within the temperature range of +5 degrees-10 degrees results in the appearance of large smooth areas on s. faecalis membrane fracture  faces, but does not affect the ones of m. lysodeikticus membrane. treatment of the washed suspensions with triton x-100 results in the appearance of drastic changes of s. faecalis membrane fracture faces and does not change the fracture faces of m. lysodeikticus membranes; treatment by the detergent does not alter the ir-spectroscopy of membranes of both bacteria. treatment of s. faecalis and m. lysodeikticus membranes with high temperature irreversibly changes the structure of 20% and 40% of protein components respectively,, but does not affect the distribution of the subparticles on their fracture faces. it is assumed that  the differences found are determined by the composition of lipid components of the membranes studied and that the amount of proteins closely bound with lipids in the membranes of s. faecalis is likely to be greater than that of m. lysodeikticus membranes.

TI  == selective adsorption of heterophile polyglycerophosphate antigen from antigen extracts of streptococcus mutans and other gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == hot saline extracts of streptococcus mutans have been shown to contain antigenic  substances which occasionally react nonspecifically with some antisera against whole cells of various serological groups and types of streptococci. chromatography of the extract of s. mutans strain mt703 (serotype e) on a diethylaminoethyl-sephadex a-25 column gave two principal antigens. one antigen was eluted without adsorption to the resin and was identified as the serotype-specific polysaccharide. the other antigen, which contained a large quantity of phosphorus, was absorbed to and released from the resin by gradient elution. it was reactive against the antisera specific for polyglycerophosphate (pgp) from group a streptococcus pyogenes and/or s. mutans strain ingbritt (type  c). the pgp antigen was further purified by gel filtration with sephadex g-75. two peaks, pgp-1, and pgp-2, were obtained. each possessed the same antigenic specificity to anti-pgp serum as shown by immunodiffusion. chemical analyses revealed that the molar ratio of phosphorus to glycerol in both was about 1:1, although the protein content between the two was significantly different. pgp antigen was found to be widely distributed in hot saline extracts from various gram-positive bacteria, with a few exceptions. however, all gram-negative bacteria examined were free of pgp. the pgp in the hot saline extracts of various gram-positive bacteria possessed an essentially identical antigenic specificity.  the addition of diethylaminoethyl-sephadex a-25 resin to hot saline extracts successfully removed the cross-reacting pgp antigen. after adsorption of the extract from s. mutans, the supernatant contained only type-specific polysaccharide antigen, except type b, in which both type b-specific polysaccharide and pgp antigens were absorbed with the resin. this simple procedure should be useful for the removal of the pgp-type teichoic acid from antigen extracts of bacteria that contain uncharged polysaccharides.

TI  == fecal indicator bacteria persistence under natural conditions in an ice-covered river.
AB  == total coliform (tc), fecal coliform (fc), and fecal streptococcus (fs) survival characteristics, under natural conditions at 0 degrees c in an ice-covered river, were examined during february and march 1975. the membrane filter (mf) technique  was used throughout the study, and the multiple-tube (mpn) method was used in parallel on three preselected days for comparative recovery of these bacteria. survival was studied at seven sample stations downstream from all domestic pollution sources in a 317-km reach of the river having 7.1 days mean flow time (range of 6.0 to 9.1 days). the mean indicator bacteria densities decreased continuously at successive stations in this reach and, after adjustment for dilution, the most rapid die-off was found to occur during the first 1.9 days, followed by a slower decrease. after 7.1 days, the relative survival was tc less  than fc less than fs, with 8.4%, 15.7%, and 32.8% of the initial populations remaining viable, respectively. these rates are higher than previously reported and suggest that the highest survival rates for these bacteria in receiving streams can be expected at 0 degree c under ice cover. additionally, the fc-fs ratio was greater than 5 at all stations, indicating that this ratio may be useable for determining the source of fecal pollution in receiving streams for greater than 7 days flow time at low water temperatures. the mpn and mf methods gave comparable results for the tc and fs at all seven sample stations, with both the direct and verified mf counts within the 95% confidence limits of the respective mpns in most samples, but generally lower than the mpn index. although fc recovery on membrane filters was comparable results at stations near the pollution source. however, the results became more comparable with increasing flow time. the results of this study indicate that heat shock is a major factor in suppression of the fc counts on the membrane filters at 44.5 degree c. heat shock may be minimized by extended incubation at 35 degrees c before exposure to  the higher temperature.

TI  == study of cycle of cell wall assembly in streptococcus faecalis by three-dimensional reconstructions of thin sections of cells.
AB  == a new ultrastructural method was used to study rounds of envelope synthesis that  occur in streptococcus faecalis in "growth zones" found between pairs of naturally occurring surface markers. the technique consists of producing three-dimensional reconstructions of these growth zones from the mathematical rotation, about a central axis, of measurements taken from central, longitudinal  thin sections of cells. a cycle of exponential-phase envelope growth was then simulated by arranging a series of these reconstructions in increasing order of the amount of peripheral wall surface area or the amount of cell volume that each was calculated to contain. using this simulated cycle of growth, the geometry of  a single growth zone during a round of synthesis was studied. based on this analysis, a model was developed for the assembly of the cell wall of s. faecalis. the model states that new cell wall surface is synthesized by the regulated flow  of essentially two channels of cell wall precursors into a single growth zone. one channel of precursors would be involved in the assembly of a bilayered cross  wall that would proceed at a fairly constant rate until the cross wall closes. the second channel of precursors would be involved in the separation of the bilayered cross wall into two segments of peripheral wall. these precursors would intercalate into and thicken the separating layers of the cross wall. the flow of precursors through this channel would be progressively reduced through a cycle. these decreases, when coupled with internal hydrostatic pressure, apparently would result in the enlarging peripheral wall becoming increasingly more curved and would also promote cell division by reducing the total amount of cell wall that must be assembled in order for septation to occur.

TI  == three-dimensional reconstruction of whole cells of streptococcus faecalis from thin sections of cells.
AB  == a new ultrastructural technique has been developed to study the geometry of cell  wall assembly in streptococcus faecalis, which is believed to occur between pairs of raised bands located on the organism's surface. three-dimensional reconstructions of these new regions of envelope growth are produced from the mathematical rotation (around a central axis) of various measurements taken from  central, longitudinal thin sections of cells. these reconstructions can be used to calculate the surface area and volume of the septal and peripheral walls that  were supposedly present in any given cell before sectioning. in an accompanying paper, it is shown how such surface and volume estimations, coupled with other measurements of length, thickness, and curvature, can be used to characterize a cycle of envelope growth in this organism. the validity of the assumptions used to reconstruct cells by rotation and the possible sources of error in using this  technique are discussed.

TI  == bacterial mesosomes. real structures or artifacts?
AB  == the ultrastructural study of membrane organization in gram-positive bacteria related to the oso4 fixation conditions revealed that large, complex mesosomes are observed only when the bacteria are subjected to an initial fixation with 0.1%oso4 in the culture broth, as in the prefixation step of the ryter-kellenberger procedure. evidence was obtained suggesting that the large mesosomes are produced by this prefization. the kinetic study of the membrane morphological alterations occurring during the prefixation of bacillus cereus with 0.1%oso4 in the culture broth showed that the amount of mesosome material increases linearly from zero to a maximum observed at 1.7 min of prefixation and  that at about this time a maximum is reached for the number of mesosomes per unity of cell area and for the average individual mesosome area. the large mesosomes observed in gram-positives fixed by the complete ryter-kellenberger procedure would be the result of the membrane-damaging action of 0.1%oso4. such damaging action was deduced from the observation thay 0.1%oso4 quickly lyses protoplasts and induces a quick and extensive leakage of intracellular k+ from b. cereus and streptococcus faecalis. in support of that interpretation is the observation that in bacteria subjected to several membrane-damaging treatments, mesosome-like structures are seen after three different fixation procedures. in bacteria initially fixed with 1% oso4, 4% oso4 or 2.5% glutaraldehyde, no large complex mesosomes are observed, small and simple invaginations of the cytoplasmic membrane being present. the size of these minute mesosomes is inversely proportional that causes of fixation. uranyl acetate was found among the studied  fixatives the one to the rate the least damage to bacterial membranes. this fixative satisfactorily preserves protoplasts. in bacteria initially fixed with uranyl acetate no mesosomes were found. the results of the present work throw serious doubts on the existence of mesosomes, both large and small, as real structures of bacterial cells. it is proposed that a continuous cytoplasmic membrane without infoldings (mesosomes) would be the real pattern of membrane organization in gram-positives.

AB  == in the initial phase of acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (agn), antigenic sites not covered by specific antibody can be demonstrated in the glomeruli. these sites are on the endothelial side of the glomerular basement membrane and in the mesangial matrix. the antigen is contained in a water-soluble fraction of nephritogenic streptococci. it can be highly purified by column chromatography or acrylamide electrophoresis. this antigen against which the patient develops specific antibodies is contained and immunologically identical in all nephriotogenic streptococci examined so far irrespective of their m or t protein. it is not identical with any known streptococcal extracellular product.  when antibodies are produced in rabbits against this streptococcal antigen they localize on kidney biopsies, obtained early during the disease from patients with agn in an identical way as does the labelled antibody of the serum of patients wiht agn. this antigen may be suited as a vaccine for the prevention of agn.

TI  == evaluation of pfizer selective enterococcus and kf media for recovery of fecal streptococci from water by membrane filtration.
AB  == pfizer selective enterococcus (pse) and kf agars were compared for their recovery of fecal streptococci from sewage effluent on membrane filters. the results showed that pse agar is highly selective for the enterococci. the tan color resulting from esculin hydrolysis, which was not always visible on the surfaces of the colonies, is not considered a necessary differential characteristic on pse agar since more than 90% of all colonies recovered on membrane filters were confirmed as fecal streptococci and 86% were confirmed as enterococci. the detection of esculin hydrolysis on membrane filters was not improved by using the new millipore type hc filter. kf agar recovered significantly greater numbers of  organisms but was not as selective, with 83% of the typical colonies being confirmed as fecal streptococci and 54% as enterococci. an attempt to improve the selectivity of kf agar while retaining its inclusiveness by incubation at 45 c was not successful.

TI  == turbidimetric and diffusion assay of bacitracin in feeds.
AB  == a manual turbidimetric method for determining zinc or methylene disalicylate bacitracin in feeds was developed. when zinc ions (10-4m) were added to the medium and the phosphate ion concentration in standard solutions was decreased to 1%, the median response of streptococcus faecalis was about 0.038 unit. feeds analyzed by the turbidimetric assay should be prewashed with petroleum ether and  extracted with pyridine as in 42.204. zinc bacitracin standards added to swine and broiler rations were recovered at 93.1-102.6% by the turbidimetric method. excellent agreement between the manual turbidimetric method and the plate assay was also obtained for finished feeds containing the zinc or methylene disalicylate salt of the antibiotic. the turbidimetric method appears to have high accuracy and precision. it is more rapid and less costly than the plate assay.

AB  == 1. a study was made of the assay of available lysine and available methionine using tetrahymena pyriformis w, as applied to a variety of protein-rich feedstuffs. 2. results were strongly influenced by the conditions under which the analyses were done. with most of the test samples predigestion with papain caused a large increase in the values obtained. 3. an improved assay procedure was developed which included enzymic predigestion of the test samples, "all-in" sterilization of the medium constituents, and measurement of growth from extinction values. it gave results for available lysine that were broadly similar to those obtained in growth tests with rats, and in chemical tests by the method  of carpenter (1960). values for available methionine agreed closely with those obtained in microbiological tests with streptococcus zymogenes.

TI  == aquatic indicator bacteria in the high alpine zone.
AB  == selected waters from the high alpine zone within grand teton national park, wyoming, were analyzed for populations of indicator bacteria during the past three summers to determine the influence of various factors on the quality of these waters. in general the water quality was not significantly influenced by the presence or absence of human visitors but rather by the nature of the biological community through which the streams flowed. a minority of the coliforms that were recovered from all of the sites proved to be fecal coliforms. the fecal streptococci isolated were identified as the species that were found primarily in the fecal material of the native rodent and moose populations. it is concluded that management questions that relate to the carrying capacity of alpine areas should be approached with the aid of other biological parameters along with levels of indicator bacteria in the streams.

TI  == on the mode of action of 5-diazouracil on bacterial cell division.
AB  == cell division by strains of escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium is inhibited by 5-diazouracil (5-du). division recovers in the presence of the inhibitor after a period which is temperature-dependent. recovery is probably due to breakdown of 5-du and the rate of this breakdown is apparently increased at alkaline ph. growth with 5-du caused only a slight reduction in the rate of murein synthesis and no alteration in the properties or composition of membranes  of s. typhimurium. the agent caused chaining in streptococcus fecalis and inhibition of the penicillin-induced lysis of s. typhimurium. these effects may have been due to direct inhibition of lysin activity but an indirect effect seems more likely. the most marked effect of 5-du on s. typhimurium was to cause a transient inhibition of dna synthesis. since 5-du did not stop uncoupled cell division (i.e. division occurring independently of dna replication) and since lon- strains were more sensitive to 5-du than lon+ strains, it was concluded that 5-du acts on cell division via an inhibitory effect on dna replication.

TI  == selective adherence as a determinant of the host tropisms of certain indigenous and pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == the relationship between the selective abilities of bacteria to adhere and their  predilections for colonizing different mammalian hosts was investigated by using  bacteria indigenous to the tongue dorsum of humans and rats as models. streptococcus salivarius and s. sanguis averaged 22.6 and 2.8%, respectively, of  the cultivable bacteria recovered from swab samples of the tonges of five humans, but these organisms were not indigenous on the tongues of rats (charles river strain). s. faecalis and serum-requiring diphtheroids were consistently prominant on the tongues of rats, but they were not detected on the tongues of the humans examined. the ability of these organisms to adhere to the tongue surface of the hosts was compared by introducing mixtures of streptomycin-resistant strains into the mouths of human volunteers and rats. s. salivarius adhered in higher proportions to the dorsal tongue surface of humans than did strains of s. faecalis and the serum-requiring diphtheroid. s. sanguis also adhered to human tongues better than the serum-requiring diphtheroid. however, s. faecalis and the serum-requiring diphtheroid sorbed in higher proportions to the tongues of rats.  in an in vivo assay, human strains of s. pyogenes and s. salivarius attached in higher numbers to buccal epithelial cells derived from humans than to those obtained from rats, whereas the reverse was observed with a serum-requiring diphtheroid derived from rats. collectively, these studies show that bacteria sorb with a high degree of specificity to the tissues of different mammalian hosts, and the relative adherence of the organisms studied correlated with their  natural host tropisms. the selective adherence of s. salvarius and s. faecalis was similar to the tongues of conventional and germ-free rats, suggesting that the presence of an indigenous bacterial flora did not significantly influence their attachment selectivity. moreover, the ability of these organisms to colonize the tongues of gnotobiotic rats lacking an indigenous flora paralleled their adherence selectivity. direct scanning microscopic observations indicated that the tongue dorsum of conventional rats is highly papillated but contains relatively sparse bacterial populations. indigenous organisms colonized the bases of papillae on the anterior tip and lateral edges of the tongue as discrete microcolonies, but bacteria were rarely observed on other papillae. this localized and restricted pattern of colonization and the spatial distribution of  the microcolonies of indigenous bacteria present also suggest that antagonistic interactions are unlikely to account for the bacterial tropisms observed for colonization of the tongues of rats.

AB  == streptococci are amont the most common bacterial pathogens physicians encounter in practice. infections with streptococci continue to occur with significant frequency despite the general sensitivity of these organisms to a variety of widely used antibiotics. in newborn infants and other special patient groups, streptococci may produce fulminant and fatal sepsis (table 1). in normal children and adults, infections usually are short term and often mild or unrecognized but  with the possibility of resulting, unpredictably, in nonsuppurative complications some weeks or months later. although scarlet fever has become an unusual and clinically attenuated disease, its rashless analog, streptococcal pharyngitis, presents thorny problems in the differential diagnosis of symptomatic patients and in the detection of subclinical infections. erysipelas now is a rare disease, but recent studies have confirmed that streptococci often are the primary etiologic agent in impetigo, another type of skin infection--with peculiar bacteriologic and epidemiologic features. infections with group d streptococci have always been a special case because of their frequent resistance to penicillin, and group b streptococci (also somewhat resistant) present special problems in the perinatal period. streptococci may appear in unexpected places or guises (see table 1). thus, the modern physician has little reason to relax in his vigilance for and knowledge of streptococcal infections.

TI  == synthesis of peptidoglycan in the form of soluble glycan chains by growing protoplasts (autoplasts) of streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == protoplasts (autoplasts) of streptococcus faecalis were produced by the action of native autolytic n-acetylmuramidase in the absence of added peptidoglycan hydrolases and were grown in osmotically stabilized medium containing l-[3h]lysine and d-[14c]alanine. to reduce the level of muralytic hydrolysis of glycan chains during growth, heat-inactivated cell walls were added to the medium to bind autolytic enzyme, and tetracycline (1 mug/ml) was added to inhibit further enzyme synthesis. under these conditions, protoplasts synthesized newly labeled peptidoglycan in the form of soluble, infrequently peptide cross-linked glycan chains which were released into the supernatant medium. these relatively large glycan chains were not transferred to exogenously added cell walls.

TI  == characterization of the presumed peptide cross-links in the soluble peptidoglycan fragments synthesized by protoplasts of streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == protoplasts of streptococcus faecalis atcc 9790 were produced with the aid of lysozyme, and the ability of these bodies to synthesize soluble, peptide cross-linked peptidoglycan (pg) fragments was examined. lysozyme digests of pg isolated using gel filtration from the supernatant medium of protoplasts grown in the presence of [14c]acetate and l-[3h]lysine contained small amounts of pg having kd expected for peptide cross-linked dimers and trimers. addition of benzyl penicillin (300 mug/ml) to growing protoplast cultures did not affect the  net amount of pg fragments synthesized but resulted in inhibition of synthesis of dimer and trimer fractions by 27 and 59%, respectively. failure of penicillin to  completely inhibit the accumulation of the dimer fraction was attributed to the presence of atypical forms of dimer. in fact, the supernatant medium of penicillin-treated cultures did not contain detectable amounts of typical peptide cross-linked dimer. the degree of peptide cross-linkage of protoplast pg was at most only 13% of that found in walls isolated from intact streptococci. the relative amounts of monomers, dimers, and trimers synthesized during early and late stages of protoplast growth was approximately the same. protoplasts synthesized soluble pg fragments in amounts which were of the same order of magnitude as that expected for insoluble pg produced by an equivalent amount of intact streptococci.

TI  == evidence for the synthesis of soluble peptidoglycan fragments by protoplasts of streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == growing protoplasts of streptococcus faecalis 9790 were found to synthesize and excrete soluble peptidoglycan fragments. the presence of soluble peptidoglycan derivatives in culture supernatants was determined by (i) incorporation of three  different radioactively labeled precursors (l-lysine, d-alanine, and acetate) into products which, after hen egg-white lysozyme hydrolysis, had the same kd values on gel filtration as muramidase hydrolysis products of isolated walls; (ii) inhibition of net synthesis of these products by cycloserine and vancomycin; and (iii) identification of disaccharide-peptide monomer using the beta-elimination reaction, gel filtration, and high-voltage paper electrophoresis. under the conditions of these experiments the presence of newly  synthesized, acid-precipitable (macromolecular) peptidoglycan was not detected. the predominance of monomer (70 to 80%) in lysozyme digests of peptidoglycan synthesized by protoplasts was in sharp contrast to digest of walls from intact streptococci which contain mostly peptide cross-linked products. biosynthesis and release of relatively uncross-linked, soluble peptidoglycan fragments by protoplasts was related to the absence of suitable, preexisting acceptor wall.

AB  == a method was developed to label specifically the glycan chains of the cell wall peptidoglycan of streptococcus faecalis atcc 9790 with [14c]acetate. the formation of peptide cross-links (a) during exponential growth, (b) after valine  starvation and wall thickening, and (c) during regrowth after 2 hours of valine starvation, was studied using continuous, pulse and pulse-chase labeling of the peptidoglycan with both [14c]acetate and [3h]lysine. after labeling, walls were isolated, digested with the muramidase of chalaropsis b, and the "free" peptidoglycan fragments (75 to 90% of the total peptidoglycan) were then fractionated on columns of sephadex g-50, g-50, and g-25 in series into disaccharide-peptide monomer and peptide cross-linked bisdisaccharide-peptide dimer, trisdisaccharide-peptide trimer, and higher oligomer fractions. peptidoglycan made during valine starvation and wall thickening was found to be slightly more cross-linked than peptidoglycan made during exponential growth. pulse and pulse-chase experiments indicated that peptide cross-linking continued  for an unexpectedly long time after incorporation of precursors into insoluble peptidoglycan.

TI  == relationship between various bacterial populations and coprostanol and cholesterol.
AB  == a year-long study was conducted at three different locations in canada to evaluate the relationship between fecal sterols and bacterial populations. a statistical model was constructed to study the following: (i) seasonal variations in the sterols and bacterial parameters; (ii) the differences between morning and afternoon samples; (iii) the relationship between the two sterols (coprostanol and cholesterol) as well as their relationship to the bacterial parameters; and (iv) the geographical differences between the three sampling sites. application of the model to the data indicated that (i) the relationship in receiving waters  between coprostanol and cholesterol was found to be highly significant; (ii) at two sampling sites the relationship between fecal sterols and fecal coliforms was positively significant at the 5% level; (iii) at one sampling site there was a positive relationship between fecal sterols and the fecal coliform - fecal streptococcus ratio; and (iv) in a.m. vs. p.m. samples significant differences were noted in coliform, fecal coliform, and fecal streptococcus densities while no significant differences were found in heterotroph densities and coprostanol and cholesterol levels. raw and treated sewage from four sewage-treatment plants  were also studied to provide baseline control data. data support the conclusion that while no consistent relationship exists between bacterial parameters and fecal sterols, fecal sterols could be considered as unequivocal indicators of the presence of fecal material in water.

TI  == effect of valinomycin on ion transport in bacterial cells and on bacterial growth.
AB  == the antimicrobial action of valinomycin relative to the k+ and na+ contents of the medium has been investigated in several species of bacteria, particularly in  streptococcus faecalis, which effects energy-linked transport exclusively via degradation of glycolytic atp, micrococcus lysodeikticus, effecting active ion transport by respiration and staphylococcus aureus, the energy-dependent ion transport of which is due to both glycolytic atp degradation and respiration. it  was demonstrated that valinomycin does not act on k+ transport in the glycolysing cells in the same manner as it does on respiring cells under similar conditions.  addition of valinomycin to respiring cells leads to an increase in k+ influx against the concentrational gradient in both growing and resting cells. in contrast to this, antibiotic-treated glycolysing cells experience passive k+ outflow down the concentrational gradient. it was thus concluded that the electrical potential cannot be the driving force for the energy-linked k+ transport in glycolysing cells.

AB  == the recently discovered phosphoglycolipid, phosphatidylkojibiosyl diglyceride (pkd), was first observed as a biosynthetic by-product of glycosyl diglyceride metabolism in streptococcus faecalis (faecium) atcc 9790. its structure is 1, 2-diacyl-3-o-alpha-dglucopyranosyl-6'-o-phosphoryl- [1'', 2''-diacyl-3''-o-sn-glycerol]-alpha-d-glucopyranosyl)-sn-glycerol. the biosynthesis of phosphatidyl-kojibiosyl diglyceride occurs by a novel transphosphatidylation reaction in which a phosphatidyl glycerol to the primary alcohol function at the 6 position of the internal glucose of kojibiosyl diglyceride. the reaction is catalyzed by a membrane-derived enzyme. phosphatidyl-kojibiosyl diglyceride is bound covalently through a phosphodiester  bond to the polyglycerol phosphate moiety of membrane lipoteichoic acid from s. faecalis. phosphatidylkojibiosyl diglyceride has four nonpolar long chain fatty acyl groups and appears to have the necessary physico-chemical properties to anchor the long hydrophilic glycerol phosphate polymer of lipoteichoic acid to the hydrophobic enviroment of the membrane of s. faecalis and probably other gram-positive bacteria as well.

AB  == the location of the glucosylated teichoic acid in whole cells and isolated walls  of streptococcus faecalis 8191 has been investigated using ruthenium red, gold-labelled concanavalin a and concanavalin a-peroxidase-diaminobenzidine. dense laminae were revealed in sections of osmium-fixed walls stained with ruthenium red which corresponded to similar regions stained by uranyl and lead. such regions were not seen after teichoic acid had been extracted, suggesting that the uptake of stain was by teichoic acid. however, these regions were not labelled on exposure to gold concanavalin a or concanavalin a-peroxidase-diaminobenzidine; these stains indicated that teichoic acid was situated between the dense laminae, although the distribution of stain could have been due to the inability of the concanavalin a stains to penetrate deeply. chemical binding studies showed that the teichoic acid was the major uranyl binding component in isolated walls, from which it might be inferred that teichoic acid was located in the densely staining regions. however, since osmification significantly increased the binding of uranyl (and lead stains) to non-teichoic acid material, such an inference was not necessarily valid. it is concluded that the presence of teichoic acid can be demonstrated in certain regions of the wall by concanavalin a, but its presence in densely staining regions has not been established. these experiments therefore suggest that teichoic acid may not be intimately associated with the mechanisms that generate  contrast patterns in stained sections of cell walls of streptococcus faecalis.

AB  == streptococcus faecalis strains ds-5 and streptococcus pyogenes strain ac-1 both have a 17 million dalton plasmid that determines resistance to erythromycin, lincomycin, and vernamycin b(alpha). the results of deoxyribonucleic acid-deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization experiments indicate that the two plasmids are about 95% homologous. it was also shown that erythromycin resistance is inducible in ac-1 and constitutive in ds-5.

TI  == herd incidence of bovine mastitis in four danish dairy. districts ii. evaluation  of the effect of the mastitis control scheme.
AB  == bacteriological and cytological examinations have been carried out on samples from 6,808 cows belonging to 339 herds in four danish dairy districts. after a discussion of differences between the districts as regards intensivity of mastitis control, public health surveillance, etc., definitions are given of certain terms, such as presence of bacteria, infection, pathogenic versus non-pathogenic (less pathogenic) organisms. the rate of infection with pathogenic organisms varies between districts from 23% to32% on a cow basis, and from 8% to  12% on a quarter basis. a comparison, on a cow basis, of the occurrence of pathogens as recorded in 1955/58 in three danish surveys comprising 11 dairy districts, with the occurrence as recorded in four districts in 1972, showed a decline in incidence of between 7 and 9 percentage units. together with the decline in incidence a definite change in the composition of the udder flora has  taken place during that period. in particular, there was a pronounced fall in the occurrence of group b, c, g, and l streptococci, and a relative increase in the occurrence of staphylococcus aureus. a comparison, on a quarter basis, with the occurrence of pathogens in 30 english herds subjected through three years to intensive mastitis control, including systematic treatment of dry cows, teat dipping, and weekly inspection, showed that by such a programme a slightly lower  level of infection was reached than in the 399 danish herds which had been subjected to collective control for 10-15 years. the annual financial loss per cow suffering from mastitis being estimated at d.kr. 600.-, the reduction noted in the occurrence of bacteria in cows' udders implies an annual national saving of d.kr. 42 million on account of the danish mastitis control. the total annual expenditure on danish mastitis control is estimated at d.kr. 9million expenses would rise to some 70 million d.kr. if all registered cows were to be treated on  drying-off, and if general teat dipping was to be carried out.

TI  == cellular localization of lipoteichoic acid in streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == the release of lipoteichoic acid and mesosomal vesicles to the supernatant buffer during the formation of spherical, osmotically fragile bodies was studied using streptococcus faecalis atcc 9790. autolytic n-acetylmuramidase action was permitted to take place in exponential-phase cells incubated in a buffer which provides an exceptional degree of osmotic stabilization. both lipoteichoic acid and mesosomal vesicles were relatively rapidly released to the supernatant buffer. most of the cellular content of lipoteichoic acid (and mesosomal vesicles) was found in the supernatant buffer at incubation times when the cells  still retained over 75% of their cell wall. [14-c]- or [3-h]glycerol was used as  a label for both cellular lipoteichoic acids and lipid-glycerol. glycerol in lipoteichoic acid was quantitated after phenol-water and chloroform-methanol treatments and identified by products of acid hydrolysis and its ability to be precipitated by (i) antibodies specific for the polyglycerol-phosphate backbone,  (ii) antibodies to the streptococcal group d antigen, and (iii) concanavalin a. evidence was obtained that lipoteichoic acid was not associated with isolated mesosomal vesicles. centrifugation of supernates at 200,000 x g sedimented membranous (mesosomal) vesicles and nearly all of the lipid-glycerol present, whereas essentially all of the lipoteichoic acid remained in the supernatant. the sedimented mesosomal vesicles differed from protoplast membrane in their higher lipid-phosphorus to protein ratio and in the absence of detectable levels of two  enzymatic activities found in protoplast membranes, adenosine triphosphatase and  polynucleotide phosphorylase. both types of membranes were found to contain dd-carboxypeptidase and ld-transpeptidase activities at nearly the same specific  activities. no evidence was obtained for the association of autolytic n-acetylmuramidase activity with either type of membrane preparation.

TI  == subclinical mastitis in suckler cows.
AB  == in a two-year study of the incidence of subclinical mastitis in two beef suckler  herds over 2400 quarter milk samples from 180 cows were examined. somatic cell counts and total bacterial counts were carried out and infecting organisms were isolated on sheep blood agar. results of these tests indicated that: (a) in spite of extremely dirty udders, fewer contaminants were found in the suckler cow milk  samples than in a group of over 1700 samples from typical dairy herds; (b) 18 per cent of all quarter milk samples were infected; (c) 67 per cent of all infections were due to staphylococci and 20 per cent to streptococci; (d) 56 per cent of staphylococcal infections were associated with cell counts less than 500,000 per  ml compared with 39 per cent of other infections; (e) 70 per cent of samples had  somatic cell counts less than 500,000 per ml. (f) 20 per cent of samples had somatic cell counts over 1 million per ml; (g) only 36 per cent of samples with cell counts over 1 million per ml were associated with udder infections; (h) high cell counts and udder infections were more frequent in early than in mid-lactation. due to a shortage of animals in the late lactation little evidence was available to support the contention that cell counts rise and the numbers of  infected quarters increase towards the end of lactation.

TI  == phagocytosis in patients and carriers of chronic granulomatous disease.
AB  == the phagocytic capacity of leucocytes from four patients and two carriers of chronic granulomatous disease (c.g.d.) was compared to that of normal leucocytes. leucocytes from c.g.d. patients phagocytised more staphylococcus aureus than did  normal leucocytes after 5, 10, and 20 minutes of incubation. phagocytosis by leucocytes from two carriers of c.g.d. was intermediate between that in the patients and in controls. in contrast, phagocytosis of streptococcus faecalis, an organism readily killed by c.g.d. leucocytes, was similar for control and c.g.d.  leucocytes. enhanced phagocytosis may represent an attempt by leucocytes to compensate for a bactericidal abnormality. in addition, these observations may partly explain why carriers of c.g.d. are not more susceptible to infection despite abnormal leucocyte function. detection of carriers using the described assay of phagocytosis appears relatively simple compared to previously described  methods.

AB  == report is given of clinical experiences gained with the new developed semi-syntheticpenicillin "spectacillin" on 75 patients suffering from an urological disease. the drug has been applied for therapy of acute and chronic forms of inflammations of the bladder and the urethra, additionally the prostatitis, the epididymitis, but first of all the pyelonephritis (caused bacterially). within the germ spectrum of these diseases, germs of the coli-type, streptococcus faecalis (enterococcus), staphylococcus aureus, neisseria gonorrhoeae, proteus, pseudomonas and aerobacter were found. patients with acute/subacute diseases have been treated 8 to 9 days (3-4 grams per day) on an average; in case of chronic diseases, the patients received initially 1 gram a day and thereupon during 3 to 4 weeks 3 to 4 grams per day. the well-succeeded results have been documentated by means of the clinical course, the germ-elimination and the laboratory findings. the exanthematous quote may be demonstrated as remarkably low, considering the good universal compatibility of the substance. for this reason "spectacillin" not finally is suitable for treatment of acute and chronic infections of the urogenital systems.

TI  == plasmid-determined tetracycline resistance in streptococcus faecalis: evidence for gene amplification during growth in presence of tetracycline.
AB  == the tetracycline (tg)-resistant streptococcus faecalis strain ds-5cl harbors two  plasmids designated alpha and gamma with molecular masses of approximately 6 and  35 million daltons, respectively. tc-sensitive variants were derived by storing cells at 45 degrees for 2-3 weeks. analysis of covalently closed circular dna from five such variants (derived independently) revealed that in each variant the alpha-plasmid, which normally sediments at 28 s (supercoiled) in a sucrose density gradient, was replaced by a 22s substance. growth of ds-5cl in the presence of 150 mug/ml of tc (minimum inhibitory concentration is 250 mug/ml in liquid broth) for a prolonged period of time (50-60 generations) resulted in the  disappearance of 28s dna and the appearance of a heterogeneous covalently-closed  circular dna sedimenting at about 40-48 s. this phenomenon was accompanied by an  increase in the level of bacterial tc-resistance, whereby tells were subsequently grown in the absence of tc for 70-80 generations, the heterogeneous dna disappeared and a typical 28s alpha-plasmid reappeared. the cells also became less resistant to tc, i.e., the minimum inhibitory concentration returned to 250  mug/ml. these data suggest that bacterial growth in the presence of tc results in a reversible gene amplification with respect to a tc-resistant determinant residing on the alpha-plasmid.

TI  == synthesis of n-10-methyl-4-thiofolic acid and related compounds.
AB  == compound 21 (n10-methyl-4-thiofolic acid) and related compounds were prepared as  potential inhibitors of the cofactor forms of tetrahydrofolate. the preparation of 2-acetylamino-4-(benzylthio)-6-chloro-5-nitropyrimidine (4) provided an intermediate that was allowed to react with methyl p-[(3-aminoacetonyl)methylamino]benzoate oxime (16). the oxime function of the resulting 6-substituted aminopyrimidine 6 was hydrolyzed to give the corresponding acetonylaminopyrimidine 7, which on reductive cyclization gave methyl p-[[[2-amino-4-(benzylthio)-7,8-dihydro-6-pteridinyl]methyl]methylamino]benzoate  (9). this dihydropteridine was oxidized with potassium permanganate, and the product was treated successively with sodium hydrosulfide to replace the benzylthio group and with aqueous sodium hydroxide to hydrolyze the ester function to give p-[[(2-amino-3,4-dihydro-4-thioxo-6-pteridinyl)methyl]methylamino]benzoic acid (n10-methyl-4-thiopteroic acid, 12). another route to 12 involved the interaction of 2,5-diamino-4,6-dichloropyrimidine (15) with 16 to give methyl p-[[(2-amino-4-chloro-7,8-dihydro-6-pteridinyl)methyl]methylamino]benzoate (13).  displacement of the chloro group of 13 with sodium hydrosulfide followed by the simultaneous air oxidation of the dihydropteridine ring and saponification of the ester group gave 12. after protection of the 2-amino and 4-thioxo moieties of 12, the resulting intermediate benzoic acid was coupled with diethyl l-glutamate. the product of this reaction was deblocked to give 21. methylation of 21 gave the corresponding 4-(methylthio) derivative 22, which on reaction with hydrazine gave the 4-hydrazino analog 23 of methotrexate. reduction of 12 and 21 with sodium hydrosulfite gave the dihydropteridines 24 and 25, respectively. the title compound was an excellent inhibitor of the growth of streptococcus faecium atcc 8043. however, this and related compounds were ineffective inhibitors of dihydrofolic reductase and showed no significant activity in either the kb cell culture screen or against l1210 leukemia cells in mice.

TI  == effect of sodium cyanate upon the function of normal human polymorphonuclaer leukocytes.
AB  == sodium cyanate, a drug that prevents sickling of hemoglobin s by virtue of its irreversible carbamylation of the n-terminal amino group of valine, was studied for its effect upon the function of normal human polymorphonuclear luekocytes. in concentrations of 500 and 100 mug/ml, sodium cyanate was found to inhibit killing by neutrophils of staphylococcus epidermidis and eschierichia coli but not of streptococcus faecalis. viability of cells and phagocytosis were not affected by  cyanate; however, production of [14-c] carbon dioxide from [1-14-c] glucose and the iodination of 125-i during phagocytosis were significantly impaired. cyanate  is thought to inbibit the bacterixidal activity of neutrophils by interfering with the oxidative metabolism of gluxose via the hexose monophosphate shunt (theraby decreasing production of h-2-o-2) and by inbibiting iodination of ingested bacteria (either by competing with iodide as the oxidizable cofactor or  by inhibiting myeloperoxidase). since these effects of cyanate were all reversible by washing the nurtrophils free of the drug, it is unlikely that they  are due to amino carbamylation.

TI  == enzymatic adaptation by bacteria under pressure.
AB  == a study of enzymic adaptation under hydrostatic pressure by moderately barotolerant bacteria that can grow at pressure up to about 500 atm revealed that some adaptive processes are relatively insensitive to pressure, whereas others are sufficiently barosensitive to compromise survival capacity in situations requiring adaptation to new substrates under pressure. examples of the former include adaptation of escherichia coli to arabinose catabolism for growth and adaptation of streptococcus faecalis to catabolism of lactose, ribose, or maltose. examples of the latter include derepression of the lac operon in escherichia coli and induction of penicillinase synthesis by bacillus licheniformis. for both these barosensitive systems, pressure had little effect on enzyme levels in constitutive strains or in bacteria that had previously been  induced at 1 atm. moreover, it had no detectable effect on penicillinase secretion. however, pressures of 300 to 400 atm were found to reduce markedly rates and extents of enzyme synthesis by bacteria undergoing derepression or adaptation. this inhibitory effect of pressure was reflected in greater barosensitivity with extended lag and slower growth of initially unadapted escherichia coli cells inoculated into minimal medium with lactose as sole source of carbon and fuel, and by major reductions in the minimal inhibitory concentrations of penicillin g for unadapted b. licheniformis cells inoculated into complex, antibiotic-containing media. cyclic adenosine 5'-monophosphate did  not reverse pressure inhibition of derepression of the lac operon, and catabolite repression was complete under pressure. however, derepression of the lac operon was more sensitive to pressure at low concentrations of inducer than at high concentrations. apparent volume changes for derepression were 94 and 60 ml/mol at inducer concentrations of about 0.5 and 5 mm, respectively. pressure was found not to be inhibitory for uptake of beta-galactosides; in fact, it was somewhat stimulatory. therefore, results were interpreted in terms of inducer binding and  subsequent conversion of an operator-inducer-repressor complex to inactive repressor and operator. both reactions appeared to result in an increase in volume, the former more so than the latter. we found also that 200 atm was actually stimulatory for growth of escherichia coli in minimal media, and the bacterium was in a sense barophilic.

TI  == accumulation of arsenate, phosphate, and aspartate by sreptococcus faecalis.
AB  == uptake of arsenate and phosphate by streptococcus faecalis 9790 is strictly dependent on concurrent energy metabolism and essentially unidirectional. targinine supports uptake only in presence of glycerol or related substances; glycerol is not directly involved in transport but depletes the cellular orthophosphate pool and thus relieves feedback inhibition of transport. uptake of phosphate and arsenate is stimulated by k+ and by other permeant cations. the results suggest that electroneutrality is preserved by compensatory movement of either h+ or oh minus. ionophores and n,n'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, which prevent establishment of a proton motive force, block the accumulation of thiomethylgalactoside and of threonine but not that of arsenate or phosphate. we  conclude that arsenate accumulation requires adenosine 5'-triphosphate but is not driven by the proton-motive force. however, conditions and reagents that lower the cytoplasmic ph do inhibit accumulation of arsenate and phosphate, suggesting  that uptake depends on the capacity of the cells to maintain a neutral or alkaline cytoplasm. we therefore propose that phosphate accumulation is an electroneutral exchange for oh driven by adenosine 5'-triphosphate or by a metabolite thereof. accumulation of aspartate and glutamate also requires adenosine 5'-triphosphate but not the proton-motive force and may involve a similar mechanism.

AB  == strains of streptococcus faecalis var. zymogenes, designated jh1 and jh3, produced a hemolysin and a bacteriocin. hemolytic activity was lost from a low percentage of cells grown in broth at either 37 or 45 c. all nonhemolytic (hly-)  variants had lost bacteriocin activity (ben-), and those from strain jh3 had also lost resistance to the bacteriocin (bnr-). the majority of hly-, ben- variants from jh1 retained bacteriocin resistance (bnrplus). strains jh1 and jh3 contained a plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid species of molecular weight 38 times 10-6 (plasmids pjh2 and pjh3, respectively), and strain jh1 also contained a 50 times  10-6 molecular weight plasmid (pjh1) which has previously been shown to carry the genes determining resistance to the antibiotics kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, erythromycin, and tetracycline. hly-, bcn-, bnr- variants of strain jh3 had completely lost plasmid pjh3. hly-, bcn-, bnr- variants of strain jh1 had completely lost plasmid pjh2 and retained plasmid pjh1, but hly-, bcn-, bnrplus variants had retained both plasmids pjh2 and pjh1. the hlyplus, bcnplus, bnrplus  traits from both parental strains were transferable to nonhemolytic s. faecalis strains during mixed incubation in broth at 37 c, and hemolytic recipient strains were found to have received plasmid pjh2 from strain jh1 and pjh3 from jh3. we conclude that the hlyplus, bnrplus traits are borne on plasmid pjh2 in strain jh1 and pjh3 in strain jh3 and that, in hly-, bcn-, bnrplus variants of strain jh1, plasmic pjh2 has suffered a mutation affecting hemolysin and bacteriocin expression. we infer that the plasmids transfer by conjugation. beta-hemolytic activity is the only property distinguishing the zymogenes variety from s. faecalis. since we have shown that this activity is plasmid borne in strains jh1  and jh3, we endorse the view that the varietal status of zymogenes should be dropped.

AB  == 1. from streptococcus faecalis a third novel phosphoglucolipid was isolated. it contained d-glucose, glycerol, acyl groups and phosphorus in a molar ratio of approx. 2 : 3 : 4 : 2. 2. the structure was shown to be 3(1)-o-[6 inches-(sn-glycerol-1-phosphoryl), 6 foot-(1,2 diacyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphoryl)-2 foot-o-(alpha-d-glucopyranosyl)-alpha-d-glucopyranosyl]-1(3),2-diacylglycerol. the novel lipid is related to the earlier described phosphatidyl and glycerophosphoryl kojibiosyl diacylglycerol from streptococcus faecalis by combininb their substituents in its structure. 3. the structure of the deacylated core was accomplished by analyses of the breakdown products obtained on smith degradation and strong alkaline hydrolysis. the location of the acyl groups was achieved by degradation of the intact lipid with 60% hf (w/v) which resulted in the formation of inorganic phosphate, glycerol, diacylglycerol and diglucosyl diacylglycerol. the sn-glycerol-1-phosphoryl and 3-sn-phosphatidyl substituents were located by hydrolysis of the lipid with 98% acetic acid (v/v) and subsequent analysis of the resultant phosphatidyl diglucosyl diacylglycerol. 4. the composition and positional distribution of the constituent fatty acids at the two diacylglycerol portions was studied by combination of chemical and enzymatic degradations. the fatty acids are the same as with the other polar lipids of s. faecalis, they are present in nearly the same proportions and display the same non-random distribution pattern. 5. a possible relationship between sn-glycerol 1-phosphate containing phosphoglucolipids and lipoteichoic acid will be discussed.

TI  == factors that may prevent transfer of anti-biotic resistance between gram-negative bacteria in the gut.
AB  == antibiotic-resistance transfer between populations of donor and recipient strains of escherichia coli was completely inhibited in broth by dense suspensions of bacteroides fragilis. comparable amounts of inert bacterial matter (for-molised suspensions of e. coli or b. fragilis), or smaller numbers of viable b. fragilis, streptococcus faecalis, staphylococcus albus, neisseria catarrhalis, or solutions of sodium taurocholate or glycocholate were only moderately inhibitory. anaeroboisis had no effect upon plasmid transfer. population densities of enteric organisms in these studies were similar to those found in faeces. the presence of dense cultures of b. fragilis provide a satisfactory explanation for almost total inhibition of conjugation in the human gut. other factors inhibiting conjugation  to a lesser degree may reinforce the effect of b. fragilis in vivo. as well as selecting for resistant organisms, antibiotics may also indirectly increase populations of r factor-bearing organisms in the gut by interfering with the anaerobic flora and so permit an increase in the frequency of conjugation.

AB  == the problems associated with recovery of pure cultures of escherichia coli and streptococcus faecalis from stream environments were examined utilizing membrane  filter chambers. it was observed that upon exposure to the aquatic environment a  significant proportion of cells lost their ability to produce colonies on a selective medium, yet retained this capability on a nutritionally rich, nonselective medium. discrepancies in colony-forming units between nonselective and selective media indicated that a substantial portion of bacterial cells may become physiologically injured due to the environmental stress imposed by the aquatic environment. the extent of injury was observed to vary considerably among the eight different stream environments, since the amount of injury was not uniform for all types of water environments examined. it was observed that the injury acquired by a population of e. coli, during exposure to the aquatic environment, could be rapidly repaired in a nutritionally rich, nonselective medium. as the injured population of cells was exposed to the rich, nonselective  broth, increasing proportions of cells were able to repair themselves such that they became insensitive to inhibitory agents in selective media.

TI  == phosphatidylkojibiosyl diglyceride. the covalently linked lipid constituent of the membrane lipoteichoic acid from streptococcus faecalis (faecium) atcc 9790.
AB  == water-soluble [14c]glycerol-labeled lipoteichoic acid isolated from the membrane  preparations of streptococcus faecalis (faecium) atcc 9790 released chloroform-soluble radioactivity upon mild acid hydrolysis. chromatography of the radioactive, chloroform-extractable material revealed the presence of a very polar lipid (lipid i). depending upon the conditions of acid hydrolysis, lipid i  accounted for as much as 92% of the total 14c-labeled lipids released. more stringent conditions of acid hydrolysis reduced the amount of lipid i and increased the quantity of the other lipids. lipid i on further mild acid hydrolysis yielded phosphatidylkojibiosyl diglyceride almost quantitively. the other lipids released from the lipoteichoic acid were kojibiosyl diglyceride, monoglucosyl diglyceride, monoglyceride, diglyceride, and phosphatidylmonoglucosyl diglyceride. these lipids are most likely the degradation products of phosphatidylkojibiosyl diglyceride because they are all simpler, structural derivatives of the phosphoglucolipid and they increase in concentration with increasing acid hydrolysis. these and other data demonstrate that the glycerol phosphate polymer of the membrane lipoteichoic acid of s. faecalis (faecium) atcc 9790 is covalently linked through a phosphodiester bond to phosphatidylkojibiosyl diglyceride.

AB  == studied were a total of 270 samples of raw and pasteurized milk taken during the  various technologic states of pasteurized mild produced for consumption at the state economic enterprise "serdica", establishing the enterococcus and coli titers. it was found that the enterococcus titer of the raw milk varies from 10(-3) up to 10(-6), and the titer of the pasteurized milk at the enterprise and  upon delivery through its commercial channels is from 1 up to 10(-3). the enterococcus titer of milk that was pasteurized and was kept for 24 hours at 4-5  degrees c was found to range from 1 to 10(-3), and of milk kept at 18-22 degrees  c --from (0(-1) to 10(-6). full coincidence of the enterococcus titer with the values of the coli titer was found only for pasteurized milk kept under refrigerator conditions. along with the coli titer the enterococcus one may be used as a subsidiary means in a more strict bacteriologic control, however, it may not be referred to as the only criterion replacing the coli values in the hygiene evaluation of milk. all species of enterococci in varying counts are established in both raw and pasteurized milk. prevailing are the strains of the str. faecium group -- 43.2 per cent, and those of the str. faecalis group -- 24.6 per cent.

TI  == streptococcus faecalis and streptococcus faecium in infected dental root canals at filling and their susceptibility to azidocillin and some comparable antibiotics.
AB  == the study was performed on 612 routine cultures of material obtained from root canals of teeth at the time of filling (r-cultures) by students at the department of endodontics during a continuous period of one year. twenty-nine isolates from  27 (29.3%) of the 92 positive cultures filled the criteria of enterococci (sherman, 1937) and had demonstrable group d-antigen. with a set of tests these isolates were identified as follows: strep. faecalis subsp. faecalis (10), strep. faecalis subsp. zymogenes (3), strep. faecalis subsp. liquefaciens (8), atypical  variants of strep. faecalis (6), strep. faecium var. faecium (1) and strep. faecium var. durans (1). five tests in the present study clearly differentiated strep. faecalis from strep. faecium i.e. fermentation of sorbitol, glycerol (anaerobic) and melezitose, tolerance to potassium tellurite (0.1%) (positive for strep. faecalis) and production of hydrogen peroxide (positive for strep. faecium). in the inocula 10(3) or more colony forming units of enterococci were found more often of other identified microorganisms. this means that enterococci  are of special interest in studies on the influence of infection at the time of filling of root canals on the prognosis of root canal therapy. the isolates were  also tested for susceptibility to azidocillin, ampicillin, penicillin-g, penicillin-v and erythromycin with the paper disc method. all the isolates were susceptible to azidocillin and ampicillin (sensitivity group i), while the majority of the isolates showed a lower susceptibility to the other three antibiotics (sensitivity group ii). the significance of these findings in the choice of prophylactic antibiotic to prevent bacterial endocarditis in patients with a history of rheumatic or congenital heart disease are discussed, when bacteremia from dental procedures may be expected.

TI  == simple technique for the assay of antibiotic synergism against enterococci.
AB  == a simple technique with antibiotic-impregnated disks has been developed to demonstrate the antibiotic synergism of penicillins and aminoglycosides against enterococci. the two antibiotic disks are placed on inoculated plates so that the distance between their centers is less than the sum of the two radii of their previously determined inhibitory zones. after 5 h of incubation, beta-lactamase powder is dusted onto the susceptibility plate with a sterile cotton swab. after  overnight incubation, the synergistic effect of the antibiotics is demonstrated by a clear area of no growth in between the two disks. there is good correlation  between the synergism determined by this procedure and the susceptibility of the  organisms to 2 mg of streptomycin per ml. this technique is simple and can be employed by any laboratory which performs kirby-bauer susceptibility procedures.

TI  == studies of substructure and tightly bound nucleotide in bacterial membrane atpase.
AB  == highly purified preparations of streptococcus faecalis atpase contain a similar but inactive protein detected by prolonged polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the inactive protein appears to arise by proteolytic cleavage of the major subunits in the enzyme. by use of a new technique, subunit analysis in sds gels was performed on the enzyme band and the inactive protein band excised from a polyacrylamide gel after electrophoresis. the results indicated that the atpase has the composition alpha3beta3gamma in which alpha = 60,000, beta = 55,000, and  gamma = 37,000 daltons. the inactive protein appears to have the composition (f)6 in which f = 49,000 daltons. there is also evidence that the enzyme band contains some slightly modified forms of the atpase, such as alpha3beta2 (f)gamma. the inactive protein lacks the capacity for tight nucleotide binding. our experiments show that the tight atpase-nucleotide complex formed in s. faecalis cells (the endogenous complex) behaves differently from the tight complex formed in vitro (the exogenous complex). we prepared a doubly labeled complex containing endogenous 32p-labeled adp and atp and exogenous 3h-labeled adp. we observed that the addition of free nucelotide to the doubly labeled atpase displaced the exogenous bound ligand from the enzyme but not the endogenous bound nucleotide. we suggest that the displaceable and nondisplaceable forms of the tight atpase-nucleotide complex correspond to two different conformational states of the enzyme.

TI  == proposed reproductive cycle for a relatively stable l-phase variant of streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == based on electron microscopic observations, the reproductive cycle of a relatively stable l-phase variant of streptococcus faecalis was proposed. the small, dense, nonvesiculated l-form is envisioned as the central (core) element.  it was seen to divide and bud rapidly. in addition, the dense forms appeared to be capable of growth and development within vesicles of mature mother forms. when these forms were released from the vesicles into the surrounding fluid medium, further growth occurred, resulting in the development of immature and ultimately  mature mother forms. under conditions unfavorable for l-form growth, these dense  forms developed first into transitional forms and then into the bacterial form. these dense forms might therefore be considered as undifferentiated "stem cells'  with the capacity to develop along several different routes, depending upon the stimulus received.

TI  == demonstration of the phenomena of microbial persistence and reversion with bacterial l-forms in human embryonic kidney cells.
AB  == a series of experiments was undertaken in which human embryonic kidney (hek) fibroblasts were infected with either relatively stable or stable l-forms of streptococcus faecalis. the infected cells were maintained by splitting over long periods (1 to 2 months) while samples were withdrawn for culture and electron microscopic studies. relatively stable s. faecalis l-forms could be cultured from infected cells only during the first week after infection, although l-form-like material was frequently detected at later periods by electron microscopy. hek cells continued to proliferate and showed no gross histopathology until reversion occurred. at reversion, electron microscopy revealed the presence of intracellular l-forms, transitional variants, and intra- and extracellular bacterial forms. unlike relatively stable l-forms, stable l-forms were culturable throughout the experimental period. these experiments demonstrate the phenomena of persistence and reversion in vitro. electron microscopy indicated that the l-forms entered the hek cells, where they underwent morphological changes. observations suggested that these altered l-forms (elementary bodies) persisted in the cell until reversion to the parent bacterial form was triggered. infected  cells, when treated with l-form antiserum and stained with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit serum, were consistently positive regardless of cultural findings.

AB  == rogosa broth, without its salt supplement and dissolved in deionized water, was adapted for the selective isolation and enumeration of enterococci. this medium supported good growth of enterococci, but it suppressed growth of other lactic acid bacteria. the sensitivity and specificity of the medium were tested after addition of various increasing concentrations of nan(3) against known strains of  enterococci and other bacteria. many strains of streptococcus faecium showed low  azide tolerance; optimal growth was obtained at a concentration of 0.01% nan(3),  which totally or partially inhibited unrelated species of lactic acid bacteria. the selectivity of the medium was further increased by ph adjustment to 9.6. carbonate and tween 80 were added to overcome partial inhibition of enterococcal  growth by the new combination of selective conditions. the final medium was evaluated in agar form in isolations from human and animal feces, polluted water, meat, and dairy products. counts were obtained after 16 to 17 h of incubation at  37 c. the isolates satisfactorily conformed to the group characteristics of enterococci.

TI  == inactivation of dried bacteria and bacterial spores by means of gamma irradiation at high temperatures.
AB  == dried preparations with streptococcus faecium, strain a(2)1, and spores of bacillus sphaericus, strain c(i)a, normally used for control of the microbiological efficiency of radiation sterilization plants and preparations with spores of bacillus subtilis, normally used for control of sterilization by dry heat, formalin, and ethylene oxide, as well as similar preparations with micrococcus radiodurans, strain r(1), and spores of bacillus globigii (b. subtilis, var. niger) were gamma irradiated with dose rates from 16 to 70 krad/h  at temperatures from 60 to 100 c. at 80 c the radiation response of the spore preparations was the same as at room temperature, whereas the radiation resistance of the preparations with the two vegetative strains was reduced. at 100 c the radiation response of preparations with spores of b. subtilis was unaffected by the high temperature, whereas at 16 and and 25 krad/h the radiation resistance of the radiation-resistant sporeformer b. sphaericus, strain c(i)a, was reduced to the level of radiation resistance of preparations with spores of b. subtilis. it is concluded that combinations of heat and gamma irradiation at the temperatures and dose rates tested may have very few practical applications in sterilization of medical equipment.

TI  == effect of temperature on the distribution of membrane particles in streptococcus  faecalis as seen by the freeze-fracture technique.
AB  == when cells of streptococcus faecalis atcc 9790 were incubated at temperatures above 10 c before being frozen for freeze-fracture, a random distribution of particles was observed on the outer fracture face of the freeze-cleaved cell membrane. however, when cells were incubated below 10 c before freezing, particleless patches were seen on this membrane surface. the size of the patches  produced on chilling could be increased by centrifugation or by storing the chilled cells overnight at about 3 c. patch formation appeared readily reversible, since the medium and large patches that formed on chilling could not  be observed in cells warmed for 10 s at 25 c. however, during the transition from the patch to patchless state, smaller patches not seen in the chilled cells were  observed. this suggested that the smaller patches might have been intermediate forms produced by the fragmentation of larger patches on warming.

TI  == factors influencing the frequency of mesosomes observed in fixed and unfixed cells of streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == mesosomes of streptococcus faecalis (american type culture collection 9790) were  seen about 92% less frequently in freeze fractures of unfixed cells than in freeze fractures and sections of fixed cells. this difference in frequency was not related to any period of unbalanced macromolecular synthesis induced by chemical fixation. all measured synthetic processes (dna, rna, and protein synthesis, and glycerol incorporation) were halted with either osmium tetroxide (os) or glutaraldehyde fixation. that fewer mesosomes were seen in freeze fractures of unfixed cells was probably due to the difficulty of observing cross-fractured mesosomes in this organism in the unfixed state. unfortunately, mesosomes probably preferentially cross fracture in the unfixed state and therefore are usually only observed, infrequently, in those cases where the freeze fracture follows the surface layer of a mesosomal membrane. however, the addition of glycerol to unfixed cells, especially in the chilled state, greatly increased the frequency of observation of cytoplasmic mesosomes in freeze fractures. it is thought that glycerol, like chemical fixation, increases the number of surface-fractured mesosomes, which in turn increases the frequency of mesosome observation. it was also observed that cellular autolysis occurring during os fixation seemingly reduced the number of mesosomes observed in thin sections and freeze fractures of os-fixed cells.

TI  == autolytic formation of protoplasts (autoplasts) of streptococcus faecalis 9790: release of cell wall, autolysin, and formation of stable autoplasts.
AB  == a system for the formation of apparently wall-free protoplasts from exponential-phase cells of streptococcus faecalis atcc 9790 in the absence of added lytic enzymes was developed. exponential-phase cells suspended in 0.04 m ammonium acetate, ph 6.7, 1 mm magnesium acetate, and 0.5 m sucrose become osmotically fragile within 1 to 1.5 h due to the action of the native, autolytic  enzyme on the cell wall peptidoglycan. however, maximal cell wall loss occurred much more slowly, being complete only after 3 to 6 h. under these conditions, the autolytically formed protoplasts (autoplasts) remained intact for prolonged periods (up to 24 h) with less than 5% of their deoxyribonucleic acid, ribonucleic acid, and protein lost during the first 6 h. during dissolution of the cell wall, release of autolytic enzyme to the supernatant fluid began after 60% of the wall was lost. the addition of trypsin to the incubation mixture increased the rate of attainment of osmotic fragility and cell wall loss two- to  threefold, apparently due to the activation of the latent form of the autolysin.  electron microscopy was used to confirm cell wall loss and the presence of intact protoplasts at the end of the incubation periods.

TI  == effect of inhibition of deoxyribonucleic acid and protein synthesis on the direction of cell wall growth in streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == selective inhibition of protein synthesis in streptococcus faecalis (atcc 9790) was accompanied by a rapid and severe inhibition of cell division and a reduction of enlargement of cellular surface area. continued synthesis of cell wall polymers resulted in rapid thickening of the wall to an extent not seen in exponential-phase populations. thus, the normal direction of wall growth was changed from a preferential feeding out of new wall surface to that of thickening existing cell surfaces. however, the overall manner in which the wall thickened,  from nascent septa toward polar regions, was the same in both exponential-phase and inhibited populations. in contrast, selective inhibition of deoxyribonucleic  acid (dna) synthesis using mitomycin c was accompanied by an increase in cellular surface area and by division of about 80% of the cells in random populations. little or no wall thickening was observed until the synthesis of macromolecules other than dna was impaired and further cell division ceased. concomitant inhibition of both dna and protein synthesis inhibited cell division but permitted an increase in average cell volume. in such doubly inhibited cells, walls thickened less than in cells inhibited for protein synthesis only. on the basis of the results obtained, a model for cell surface enlargement and cell division is presented. the model proposes that: (i) each wall enlargement site is influenced by an individual chromosome replication cycle; (ii) during chromosome  replication peripheral surface enlargement would be favored over thickening (or septation); (iii) a signal associated with chromosome termination would favor thickening (and septation) at the expense of surface enlargement; and (iv) a factor or signal related to protein synthesis would be required for one or more of the near terminal stages of cell division or cell separation, or both.

TI  == initiation of protein synthesis by folate-sufficient and folate-deficient streptococcus faecalis r: partial purification and properties of methionyl-transfer ribonucleic acid synthetase and methionyl-transfer ribonucleic acid formyltransferase.
AB  == the initiation of protein synthesis by streptococcus faecalis r grown in folate-free culture occurs without n-formylation or n-acylation of methionyl-trna(f) (met). methionyl-trna synthetase and methionyl-trna formyltransferase were partially purified from s. faecalis grown under normal culture conditions in the presence of folate (plus-folate); the general properties of the enzymes were determined and compared with the properties of the enzymes purified from wild-type cells grown in the absence of folate (minus-folate). s. faecalis methionyl-trna synthetase displays optimal activity at ph values between 7.2 and 7.8, requires mg(2+), and has an apparent molecular  weight of 106,000, as determined by gel filtration, and 127,000, as determined by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. the k(m) values of plus-folate methionyl-trna synthetase for each of the three substrates in the aminoacylation  reaction (l-methionine, adenosine triphosphate, and trna) are nearly identical to the respective substrate michaelis constants of minus-folate methionyl-trna synthetase. furthermore, both plus- and minus-folate s. faecalis methionyl-trna synthetases catalyze, at equal rates, the aminoacylation of trna(f) (met) and trna(m) (met) isolated from either plus-folate or minus-folate cells. s. faecalis methionyl-trna formyltransferase displays optimal activity at ph values near 7.0, is stimulated by mg(2+), and has an apparent molecular weight of approximately 29,900 when estimated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. the k(m) value  of plus-folate formyltransferase for plus-folate met-trna(f) (met) does not differ significantly from that of minus-folate formyltransferase for minus-folate met-trna(f) (met). both enzymes can utilize either 10-formyltetrahydrofolate or 10-formyltetrahydropteroyltriglutamate as the formyl donor; the michaelis constant for the monoglutamyl pteroyl coenzyme is slightly less than that of the  triglutamyl pteroyl coenzyme for both transformylases. tetrahydrofolate and uncharged trna(f) (met) are competitive inhibitors of both plus- and minus-folate s. faecalis formyltransferase; folic acid, pteroic acid, aminopterin, and met-trna(m) (met) are not inhibitory. these results indicate that the presence or absence of folic acid in the culture medium of s. faecalis has no apparent effect on either methionyl-trna synthetase or methionyl-trna formyltransferase, the two  enzymes directly involved in the formation of formylmethionyl-trna(f) (met). therefore, the lack of n-formylation of met-trna(f) (met) in minus-folate s. faecalis is due to the absence of the formyl donor, a 10-formyl-tetrahydropteroyl derivative. although the general properties of s. faecalis methionyl-trna synthetase are similar to those of other aminoacyl-trna synthetases, s. faecalis  methionyl-trna formyltransferase differs from other previously described transformylases in certain kinetic parameters.

AB  == the autoturb system, a semiautomated system for photometric bioassay, was used to determine cefazolin content. suitable conditions for the assay using streptococcus faecalis atcc 10541 as the indicator organism included a medium ph  of 6.0 to 7.0 and an incubation time of 3 to 3.5 h at 36 c. multiple independent  assays of samples from a common batch showed the test to be highly reproducible.  accuracy of the turbidimetric assay was evaluated by comparing data obtained from a chemical (hydroxylamine) and a biological (disk diffusion) assay. the available data show the turbidimetric assay to be a rapid, accurate, and reproducible method for determining the biological activity of cefazolin samples.

TI  == lactic acid translocation: terminal step in glycolysis by streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == streptococcus faecalis obtains metabolic energy chiefly from the conversion of glucose to lactic acid; the present experiments deal with the mechanism of lactic acid translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane. efflux of [(14)c]lactate from preloaded cells was accelerated by raising the external ph, and also by the ionophores nigericin and valinomycin. these results suggest that lactate leaves the cell by an electroneutral process, presumably as lactic acid. further evidence was obtained by studying the entry of [(14)c]lactate into nonmetabolizing cells. it appears that the membrane is essentially impermeable to the lactate anion, but allows passage of lactic acid. the most persuasive evidence is that, upon establishment of a ph gradient such that the cytoplasm was alkaline, l-[(14)c]lactate accumulated in the cells against the concentration gradient. accumulation was transient, and dissipated in parallel with the collapse of the ph gradient. the concentration gradient attained at the peak was  a function of the ph difference. ionophores which are known to collapse a ph gradient, such as nigericin and valinomycin, abolished accumulation of l-lactate. we infer that lactic acid translocation, whether into the cells or outward, is an electroneutral process and for that reason the distribution of lactic acid across the membrane is a function of the ph of cytoplasm and medium. the specificity of  translocation and its kinetic parameters suggest that it is mediated by a carrier of low specificity.

TI  == conjugal transfer of plasmid-borne multiple antibiotic resistance in streptococcus faecalis var. zymogenes.
AB  == a strain of streptococcus faecalis var. zymogenes, designated jh1, had high-level resistance to the antibiotics streptomycin, kanamycin, neomycin, erythromycin, and tetracycline. these resistances were lost en bloc from approximately 0.1% of  cells grown in nutrient broth at 45 c. the frequency of resistance loss was not increased by growth in the presence of the "curing" agents acriflavine or acridine orange, but after prolonged storage in nutrient agar 17% of cells became antibiotic sensitive. covalently closed circular deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) molecules were isolated from the parental strain and from antibiotic-sensitive segregants by using cesium chloride-ethidium bromide gradients. dna molecular species were identified by using neutral sucrose gradients. strain jh1 contained  two covalently closed circular dna species of molecular weights 50 x 10(6) and 38 x 10(6). an antibiotic-sensitive segregant, strain jh1-9, had lost the larger molecular species. a second sensitive segregant, strain jh1-5, had also lost the  larger molecular species but a new molecular species of approximate molecular weight 6 x 10(6) was present. the antibiotic resistances that were curable from the parental strain were transferred to antibiotic-sensitive strains of s. faecalis and to strain jh1-9, during mixed incubation in nutrient broth at 37 c.  data to be described are interpreted to suggest that the transfer is by a conjugal mechanism. analysis of the plasmid species in recipient clones showed that all had received the plasmid of molecular weight 50 x 10(6). strain jh1-5 was not a good recipient. analysis of one successful recipient clone of jh1-5 revealed that it had gained the 50 x 10(6) molecular weight plasmid but lost the  6 x 10(6) molecular weight species. these data are interpreted to mean that the multiple antibiotic resistance is borne by a transferable plasmid of 50 x 10(6) molecular weight, and that in clone jh1-5 this plasmid suffered a large deletion  leaving only a 6 x 10(6) remnant which was incompatible with the complete replicon.

TI  == relatedness among contractile and membrane proteins: evidence for evolution from  common ancestral genes.
AB  == a statistical method for quantifying the relatedness among proteins was used to perform 2926 paired comparisons of amino-acid composition among 77 contractile and membrane-associated proteins from diverse species and sources. relatedness of amino-acid compositions correlates with homology of amino-acid sequence. a high degree of relatedness was detected among k(+)-dependent membrane atpase of streptococcus faecalis, coupling factors f(1) and cf(1) from mitochondria and chloroplasts, outer fiber protein of cilia, ciliary dynein, tubulin, various actins, and myosin subfragment s-1. heavy meromyosin and tropomyosin were related to each other but not to the first group of proteins. differences in the degree of methylation may account for some differences in physiological function. because of their diverse sources, the high degree of relatedness among these proteins is more compatible with evolution from common ancestral genes than with  convergent evolution. squid axon filarin, molluscan paramyosin, and bacterial flagellins appear to be unrelated either to each other or to any of the other proteins studied. existence of persistent homologies among so many diverse proteins implies conservation of genetic information during evolution by utilization of codons for preferred amino-acid sequences in various proteins.

TI  == identification and measurement of the folates in sheep liver.
AB  == 1. methods are described for the extraction, separation by ion-exchange chromatography and estimation by microbiological assay of the folates in sheep liver. 2. injection of [2-(14)c]-pteroylglutamate into a sheep fed on a stock diet led to extensive labelling of chromatographically separable liver folates. about 12% of the label in the liver could not be extracted by the method used. 3. liver folates were examined in five ewes fed on restricted amounts of a diet of wheaten hay-chaff and gluten and injected weekly with vitamin b(12). chromatographic separation was followed by microbiological assay with lactobacillus casei, streptococcus faecalis r. and pediococcus cerevisiae both before and after treatment of fractions with conjugase (gamma-glutamylcarboxypeptidase). evidence was obtained that the folates present  were predominantly polyglutamate forms of tetrahydropteroylglutamate, 5-methyltetrahydropteroylglutamate and 5- (and 10-) formyltetrahydropteroylglutamates. differences in the responses of the assay organisms permitted quantitative distinction between these three main classes of  folates. 4. methyltetrahydrofolates were eluted in seven successive peaks that were separated by constant increments in the logarithm of eluant [p(i)]. a similar relationship existed for seven successive peaks of tetrahydrofolate and may also have existed for each of the two series of formyltetrahydrofolates. 5. based on these and other observations it is proposed that sheep liver folates consist predominantly of the mono- to hepta-glutamates of each of the reduced pteroates identified. the methods employed allowed quantitative determinations to be made of most of the folates present. the predominant forms were hexaglutamates. 6. four components active for l. casei were detected that could not be identified. three of them were polyglutamates.

AB  == the nh(2)-terminal amino acid distribution of streptococcus faecalis r soluble and ribosomal proteins isolated from cells at different stages of growth on either folate-sufficient or folate-deficient medium was determined by the dinitrophenyl method. the nh(2)-terminal residues do not follow the random distribution observed for the total amino acid composition of s. faecalis soluble and ribosomal proteins. methionine and alanine occur most frequently; serine, threonine, aspartic and glutamic acids, and glycine are also present at the nh(2)-terminal position of s. faecalis r proteins. the absence of folic acid yields cells that are incapable of formylating methionyl-transfer ribonucelic acid trna(f) (met), but does not affect either the qualitative or quantitative nh(2)-terminal distribution of total soluble or total ribosomal proteins compared to cells grown with folate. a small quantitative difference was observed in the frequency of distribution of certain amino acids at the nh(2)-termini between log and stationary phase soluble proteins. the amino acid residues found at the nh(2)-terminal position of s. faecalis proteins are qualitatively similar to those reported for several other organisms.

TI  == fatty acid composition of l-forms of streptococcus faecalis cultured at different osmolalities.
AB  == the fatty acid composition of the membranes of three different penicillin-produced l-forms of streptococcus faecalis was determined: (i) a stable (nonreverting) l-form (t(53)) cultured in brain heart infusion (bhi) with  0.5 m sucrose; (ii) a stable l-form (t(531)) cultured in bhi without sucrose; and (iii) an unstable l-form (t(9)) cultured in bhi with 0.5 m sucrose and 1,000 u of penicillin per ml. l-forms were obtained by centrifugation and lysed by washing in 1 mm tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane-hydrochloride buffer. the parent s. faecalis was also cultured in bhi and bhi containing 0.5 m sucrose, and washed with buffer. the fatty acid composition of l-forms of s. faecalis cultured in bhi without sucrose (370 mosmol) had higher c(18:1) and lower c(18) than l-forms cultured in the same media with added 0.5 m sucrose (950 mosmol) in both exponential and stationary cultures. in the stationary phase of growth, c(19) was reduced in the l-forms cultured without sucrose. similar changes were seen in the parent s. faecalis cultured in the two types of media. these changes in membrane  fatty acids may relate to osmo-regulation of the l-forms.

TI  == role of intestinal microflora in the metabolism of guanidinosuccinic acid.
AB  == among a variety of bacteria isolated from the gastrointestinal tracts of rats and humans, only streptococci of group n are capable of degrading guanidinosuccinic acid added to their culture medium. the urinary excretion of guanidinosuccinic acid by germfree rats is greater than that of conventional rats. the excretion of this compound by gnotobiotic rats correlates with the capacity of their intestinal microflora to degrade guanidinosuccinic acid in culture. thus, guanidinosuccinic acid excretion is low in rats infected exclusively with streptococcus faecalis, and the excretion is not altered when germfree rats are infected with an organism unable to degrade guanidinosuccinic acid (lactobacillus). these findings suggest that the intestinal microflora, particularly streptococcus, play a role in the metabolism of guanidinosuccinic acid by the host.

TI  == induction of superoxide dismutase by molecular oxygen.
AB  == oxygen induces superoxide dismutase in streptococcus faecalis and in escherichia  coli b. s. faecalis grown under 20 atm of o(2) had 16 times more of this enzyme than did anaerobically grown cells. in the case of e. coli, changing the conditions of growth from anaerobic to 5 atm of o(2) caused a 25-fold increase in the level of superoxide dismutase. induction of this enzyme was a response to o(2) rather than to pressure, since 20 atm of n(2) was without effect. induction  of superoxide dismutase was a rapid process, and half of the maximal level was reached within 90 min after n(2)-grown cells of s. faecalis were exposed to 20 atm of o(2) at 37 c. s. faecalis did not contain perceptible levels of catalase under any of the growth conditions investigated by stanier, doudoroff, and adelberg (23), and the concentration of catalase in e. coli was not affected by the presence of o(2) during growth. s. faecalis, which had been grown under 100%  o(2) and which therefore contained an elevated level of superoxide dismutase, was more resistant of 46 atm of o(2) than were cells which had been grown under n(2). e. coli grown under n(2) contained as much superoxide dismutase as did s. faecalis grown under 1 atm of o(2). the e. coli which had been grown under n(2) was as resistant to the deleterious effects of 50 atm of o(2) as was s. faecalis  which had been grown under 1 atm of o(2). these results are consistent with the proposal that the peroxide radical is an important agent of the toxicity of oxygen and that superoxide dismutase may be a component of the systems which have been evolved to deal with this potential toxicity.

TI  == acid-base titration of streptococci and the physical states of intracellular ions.
AB  == acid titrations of intact and butanol-treated cells of streptococcus faecalis revealed that nearly all of the intracellular k(+) ions could diffuse into the suspending medium in association with small anions, including ribonucleic acid breakdown products, when the cell membrane was damaged. in contrast, nearly all of the intracellular mg(2+) ions appeared to be firmly bound to stable internal cell components but could be displaced reversibly by hydronium ions. the cell membrane acted as a barrier to ion movements, and mg(2+) displacement from intact cells required more acid conditions, by as much as 2.5 ph units, than did displacement from butanol-damaged cells. some 15 to 20% of the cell magnesium appeared to be associated with surface structures in that it could be removed at  ph 7 with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or displaced by co(2+), ni(2+), sr(2+), or la(3+). magnesium could be displaced from isolated cell walls and membranes by hydronium ions in the ph range from 5 to 3, over which carboxyl groups were titrated. displacement of magnesium from ribosomes also took place between ph 5 and 3, but it was more difficult to identify the magnesium-releasing groups because both protein carboxyl groups and purine and pyrimidine ring nitrogens can become protonated in this ph range. isolated protoplast membranes remained structurally intact when completely depleted of magnesium. furthermore, protoplasts isolated from intact cells were found to have greatly enhanced resistance to osmotic shock in acid media, even when solute loss was not extensive. osmotic resistance was lost when the protoplasts were again placed in  neutral media, and this reversibility suggested that acidification caused changes in the physical properties of membranes as well as solute leakage from cells.

TI  == recurrent urethritis in women.
AB  == the bacterial flora of the vestibule, urethra and vagina of a group of patients with recurrent urethritis, and of control subjects without symptoms, was investigated. organisms regarded as pathogenic, such as enterobacteria and streptococcus faecalis, were recovered significantly more frequently from patients than from controls, whereas the reverse was found for non-pathogenic organisms. the bacterial flora was similar in the three areas, suggesting that a  specimen taken from one region only would give adequate bacteriological information. the vestibule is suggested as a suitable site. the incidence of vestibular pathogens was higher in postmenopausal patients. perineal length and vestibular ph were very similar in patient and control groups. there was some evidence that in most subjects the bacterial flora of the areas investigated remains fairly constant over a period of several weeks. although bacterial species commonly responsible for urinary tract infection may often cause recurrent urethritis, the absence of these pathogens from some patients suggests  that the etiology of this condition is not yet fully understood.

TI  == present significance of resistance to trimethoprim and sulphonamides in coliforms, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == the incidence of trimethoprim resistance in coliforms and multiresistant strains  of staphylococcus aureus isolated in bristol from 1970 to 1972 is low-2.3 and 1.0% respectively. the resistance is probably intrinsic; there is no evidence that it is r-factor or plasmid mediated. a single mechanism that confers resistance to both trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole has not been detected. normal growing one-step mutants of s. aureus and escherichia coli resistant to trimethoprim could not be isolated in vitro. for these reasons cotrimoxazole should retain its usefulness against these bacteria for some years. however, contrimoxazole was found not to be bactericidal against many coliforms. the usefulness of cotrimoxazole against streptococcus faecalis seems limited because  mutants resistant to trimethoprim occurred at high frequency in one step.

TI  == electric conductivity and internal osmolality of intact bacterial cells.
AB  == intact cells of streptococcus faecalis and micrococcus lysodeikticus were found to have high-frequency electric conductivities of 0.90 and 0.68 mho/m, respectively. these measured values, which reflect movements of ions both within  the cytoplasm and within the cell wall space, were only about one-third of those  calculated on the basis of determinations of the amounts and types of small ions  within the cells. concentrated suspensions of bacteria with damaged membranes showed similarly large disparities between measured and predicted conductivities, whereas the conductivities of diluted suspensions were about equal to predicted values. thus, the low mobilities of intracellular ions appeared to be interpretable in terms of the physicochemical behavior of electrolytes in concentrated mixtures of small ions and cell polymers. in contrast to the low measured values for conductivity of intact bacteria, values for intracellular osmolality measured by means of a quantitative plasmolysis technique were higher  than expected. for example, the plasmolysis threshold for s. faecalis cells indicated an internal osmolality of about 1.0 osmol/kg, compared with a value of  only 0.81 osmol/liter of cell water calculated from a knowledge of the cell content and the distribution of small solutes. in all, our results indicate that  most of the small ions within vegetative bacterial cells are free to move in an electric field and that they contribute to cytoplasmic osmolality.

TI  == platelet interaction with bacteria. 3. ultrastructure.
AB  == the interaction of several common strains of bacteria with rabbit or human platelets in vitro has been examined sequentially with scanning and transmission  electron microscopy. bacteria were added to platelets in their native plasma or to washed platelets in a balanced salt solution at ratios of about 1:1 or at low  bacteria to platelet ratios (down to 1:100). the platelet-bacterial interaction (pbi) was studied with recording nephelometry. matched samples were fixed for microscopy at various points in the aggregation response. the results support these conclusions: a) bacteria stimulate platelet aggregation by direct contact and adhesion with the platelet surface. b) adhesion between the two cell types requires divalent cations, occurs through fusion of normal cell-surface coats and appears identical in the presence or absence of extracellular plasma protein. c)  the morphologic transformation of platelets during pbi is identical to that produced by collagen. d) during pbi the bacteria are incorporated into the forming platelet aggregates and reside predominantly intercellularly. e) phagocytosis of bacteria by a single platelet is very rare. f) bacteria which have resided within platelet aggregates for one hour are unaltered morphologically. g) pbi occurs even at very low bacterial numbers and produces platelet-bacterial aggregates in small numbers without stimulating generalized platelet aggregation. methods for concentration of thrombocytopenic plasma and washing human platelets are presented.

TI  == influence of macromolecular biosynthesis on cellular autolysis in streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == the addition of several different antibiotics to growing cultures of streptococcus faecalis, atcc 9790, was found to inhibit autolysis of cells in sodium phosphate buffer. when added to exponential-phase cultures, mitomycin c (0.4 mug/ml) or phenethyl alcohol (3 mg/ml) inhibited deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis, but did not appreciably affect the rate of cellular autolysis. addition of chloramphenicol (10 mug/ml), tetracycline (0.5 mug/ml), puromycin (25 mug/ml), or 5-azacytidine (5 mug/ml) to exponential-phase cultures inhibited protein synthesis and profoundly decreased the rate of cellular autolysis. actinomycin d (0.075 mug/ml) and rifampin (0.01 mug/ml), both inhibitors of ribonucleic acid (rna) synthesis, also reduced the rate of cellular autolysis. however, the inhibitory effect of actinomycin d and rifampin on cellular autolysis was more closely correlated with their concomitant secondary inhibition of protein synthesis than with the more severe inhibition of rna synthesis. the dose-dependent inhibition of protein synthesis by 5-azacytidine was quickly diluted out of a growing culture. reversal of inhibition was accompanied by a disproportionately rapid increase in the ability of cells to autolyze. thus, inhibition of the ability of cells to autolyze can be most closely related to inhibition of protein synthesis. furthermore, the rapidity of the response of cellular autolysis to inhibitors of protein synthesis suggests that regulation is exerted at the level of autolytic enzyme activity and not enzyme synthesis.

TI  == growth of streptococcus faecium in the presence of lysozyme.
AB  == streptococcus faecium can grow normally in the presence of lysozyme, despite the  observation that cell suspensions of the organism are lysed readily by the enzyme. growth in the presence of lysozyme is not due to resistant cells, and the culture is lysed after growth if the ph of the medium is not allowed to drop too  low for lysozyme activity. growth followed by lysis in the presence of lysozyme was not exhibited by other organisms tested which were either significantly more  resistant or more sensitive to lysozyme than s. faecium. lysozyme was active on the cell wall of s. faecium during growth in the presence of 200 mug of the enzyme per ml in a complex medium. it appears that, when actively metabolizing, s. faecium can synthesize the cell wall at a greater rate than lysozyme can hydrolyze it. thus, the organism is capable of growth in the presence of the enzyme. a large variation in the lytic responses of enterococcal cell suspensions to lysozyme was dependent on the strain used, the growth phase from which the culture was harvested, and the medium in which the culture was grown.

AB  == amoxycillin (alpha-amino-p-hydroxybenzylpenicillin) is a new semi-synthetic penicillin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity similar to that of ampicillin. penicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococci, streptococci, and pneumococci were sensitive to concentrations of 0.1 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. strains of haemophilus influenzae were inhibited by a level of 0.5 mug/ml, and most strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, shigella sonnei, salmonella species, and streptococcus faecalis were sensitive to a concentration of 5 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. penicillinase-producing strains of staphylococcus aureus and strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, indole-positive proteus, klebsiella, and enterobacter were insensitive to amoxycillin. the new penicillin was bactericidal in activity, as with other penicillins, and its antibacterial activity was not reduced in the presence of serum. after oral administration to volunteer subjects amoxycillin produced serum concentrations twice as high as those obtained with similar doses of ampicillin, and the penicillin was recovered unchanged in high concentrations in the urine. the absorption of amoxycillin was not greatly influenced by food, and administration  of probenecid resulted in increased and more prolonged concentrations of amoxycillin in serum.

TI  == phagocytosis of microbial l-forms.
AB  == little data are available regarding l-form phagocyte interactions. due to difficulty with more conventional methods, a serum-free technique of surface phagocytosis employing cellulose ester micropore filters, fluorochrome staining,  and reflecting fluorescence microscopy was developed. intracellular localization  of l-frms was confirmed by electron microscopy. in timed experiments, phagocytosis of a group d streptococcus (atcc 23241) and its l-form (t53i) were maximal at 30 min, although the bacteria were consistently better phagocyted. phagocytosis of an escherichia coli (strain yale) and its l-form was also demonstrated with the same technique. the lesser phagocytosis of l-forms may be related to their lower chemotactic activity.

TI  == localization and interconversion of tetrahydropteroylglutamates in isolated pea mitochondria.
AB  == 1. mitochondria were extracted from 4-day-old pea cotyledons and purified on a sucrose density gradient. 2. microbiological assay of the purified mitochondrial  fraction with lactobacillus casei (a.t.c.c. 7469), streptococcus faecalis (a.t.c.c. 8043) and pediococcus cerevisiae (a.t.c.c. 8081) revealed a discrete pool of conjugated and unconjugated derivatives of tetrahydropteroylglutamic acid. 3. solubilization and chromatographic studies of the mitochondrial fraction demonstrated the presence of formylated and methylated derivatives, 10-formyltetrahydropteroylmonoglutamic acid, 5-formyltetrahydropteroylmonoglutamic acid and 5-formyltetrahydropteroyldiglutamic acid being the major derivatives present. 4.  the principal mitochondrial pteroylglutamates were labelled when dry seeds were allowed to imbibe [2-(14)c]pteroylglutamic acid and 5-[methyl-(14)c]-methyltetrahydropteroylmonoglutamic acid. 5. the ability of isolated mitochondria to catalyse oxidation and reduction of tetrahydropteroylglutamic acid derivatives was demonstrated in feeding experiments in which [(14)c]formaldehyde, [3-(14)c]serine, sodium [(14)c]formate, 5-[methyl-(14)c]methyltetrahydropteroylmonoglutamic acid or [2-(14)c]-glycine served as c(1) donor. in addition, (14)c was incorporated into free amino acids related to c(1) metabolism.

AB  == in-vitro sensitivities were performed on 140 specimens of urine which grew streptococcus faecalis of more than 100 000 organisms/ml between march 1970 and february 1971. although the combination of trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole definitely appeared to be more effective than sulphonamide alone and as effective as ampicillin, its use for more than two weeks in 14 cases of uncomplicated urinary tract infection due to streptococcus faecalis led to development of resistance. as in these cases organisms were resistant to sulphonamide to start with, it is suggested that the combination should be used in prolonged treatment  only where the organisms are sensitive to both the individual antibiotics. ampicillin is still the drug of choice in urinary tract infection due to streptococcus faecalis. the alternative appears to be rotational therapy with other potent antibiotics.

TI  == the lipid-teichoic acid complex in the cytoplasmic membrane of streptococcus faecalis n.c.i.b. 8191.
AB  == 1. a lipid-teichoic acid complex was isolated from streptococcus faecalis n.c.i.b. 8191. the covalent nature of the linkage between teichoic acid and lipid was established. 2. the complex exhibits macromolecular properties in solution, and ultracentrifugation studies show that these are due to micelle formation. 3.  from chemical studies it is concluded that the teichoic acid is a poly(glycerol phosphate) in which some of the glycerol hydroxyl groups possess kojibiosyl [2-o-alpha-d-glucopyranosyl-(1-->2)-alpha-d- glucopyranosyl] substituents, together with d-alanine ester residues. 4. the lipid is 1-kojibiosyl diglyceride, already known as a membrane component of this organism, with probably a phosphatidyl substituent. the phosphatidyl kojibiosyl diglyceride is attached to  the teichoic acid through a phosphodiester linkage, and the chain of the teichoic acid contains 28-35 units. 5. although the complex represents the whole of the membrane teichoic acid in this organism, only about 12% of the membrane glycolipid is associated with teichoic acid. 6. two phosphatidyl glycolipids, closely resembling that bearing the teichoic acid, were isolated from the lipids  of the organism and were partly characterized.

TI  == complete deficiency of leukocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase with defective bactericidal activity.
AB  == a 52 yr old caucasian female (f. e.) had hemolytic anemia, a leukemoid reaction,  and fatal sepsis due to escherichia coli. her leukocytes ingested bacteria normally but did not kill catalase positive staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and serratia marcescens. an h(2)o(2)-producing bacterium, streptococcus faecalis, was killed normally. granule myeloperoxidase, acid and alkaline phosphatase, and beta glucuronidase activities were normal, and these enzymes shifted normally to the phagocyte vacuole (light and electron microscopy). intravacuolar reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium did not occur. moreover, only minimal quantities of h(2)o(2) were generated, and the hexose monophosphate shunt (hmps) was not stimulated during phagocytosis. these observations suggested the diagnosis of chronic granulomatous disease. however, in contrast to control and chronic granulomatous disease leukocytes, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity was completely absent in f. e. leukocytes whereas nadh oxidase and nadph oxidase activities were both normal. unlike chronic granulomatous disease, methylene blue did not stimulate the hexose monophosphate shunt in f. e. cells. thus, f. e. and chronic granulomatous disease leukocytes appear to share certain  metabolic and bactericidal defects, but the metabolic basis of the abnormality differs. chronic granulomatous disease cells lack oxidase activity which produces h(2)o(2); f. e. cells had normal levels of oxidase activity but failed to produce nadph due to complete glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. these data indicate that a complete absence of leukocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase with defective hexose monophosphate shunt activity is associated with low h(2)o(2) production and inadequate bactericidal activity, and further suggest an  important role for nadph in the production of h(2)o(2) in human granulocytes.

TI  == morphokinetic reaction of cells of streptococcus faecalis (atcc 9790) to specific inhibition of macromolecular synthesis: dependence of mesosome growth on deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis.
AB  == the application of quantitative electron microscopy to thin sections of cells of  streptococcus faecalis specifically inhibited for deoxyribonucleic acid (dna), ribonucleic acid, and protein synthesis shows that septal mesosomes (i) increase  in size when protein synthesis is inhibited by at least 80% while dna synthesis proceeds at no less than 50% of the control rate and (ii) decrease in size when dna synthesis is inhibited 50% or more during the initial 10 min of treatment. this indicates that fluctuations in mesosome size are dependent on the extent of  dna synthesis. the fluctuations in mesosome areas observed on treatment do not correlate with the kinetics of glycerol incorporation per milliliter of a culture. however, when glycerol incorporation is placed on a per cell basis, a strong correlation is observed between increases in (i) the thickness of the electron-transparent layer of the cytoplasmic membrane and (ii) the amount of glycerol incorporated per cell. it seems that the electron-transparent membrane layer may thicken to accommodate changes in lipid content when protein and lipid  synthesis are uncoupled.

TI  == morphokinetic reaction of streptococcus faecalis (atcc 9790) cells to the specific inhibition of macromolecular synthesis: nucleoid condensation on the inhibition of protein synthesis.
AB  == in glutaraldehyde-prefixed exponential-phase cells of streptococcus faecalis the  nucleoid is "frozen" in a dispersed configuration. exposure of exponential-phase  cells to threonine starvation or to antibiotics inhibiting protein synthesis resulted in progressive condensation of nucleoid fibrils producing an expanding central nucleoid zone or pool. the condensation of the nucleoid was observed to occur at a rate directly proportional to the rate of inhibition of protein synthesis. however, the extent of nucleoid condensation depended on continuing deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis. significantly less nucleoid condensation occurred when cells were inhibited in deoxyribonucleic acid and protein synthesis than when cells were inhibited in protein synthesis alone. these results suggest  a model in which, during nucleoid replication, the chromosome fibrils are normally maintained in a dispersed state by the active agents of transcription-translation, such as ribonucleic acid polymerase molecules and ribosomes.

AB  == putrescine transcarbamoylase, ec 2.1.3.x (carbamoylphosphate:putrescine transcarbamoylase), has been purified from streptococcus faecalis 10c1 grown on agmatine as primary energy source. the formation of n-carbamoylputrescine from putrescine and carbamoylphosphate serves as a convenient and sensitive assay for  this enzymatic activity. the enzyme catalyzes both the phosphorolysis arsenolysis of n-carbamoylputrescine. arginine does not induce the synthesis of putrescine transcarbamoylase in s. faecalis. furthermore, the putrescine transcarbamoylase activity is easily separated from ornithine transcarbamoylase activity by gel filtration on sephadex g-100 indicating that the two activities are associated with different proteins. the significance of this new enzyme in the fermentation  of agmatine and its relation to the other known transcarbamoylases are discussed.

TI  == transport of lysine and hydroxylysine in streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == data are presented which support the view that l-lysine is transported by two systems in streptococcus faecalis. the system with the higher affinity for l-lysine appears to be specific for l-lysine among the common amino acids and to  require an energy source. the second system transports both l-lysine and l-arginine and does not appear to require an energy source. both of these systems will accept hydroxy-l-lysine as a substrate as shown by the energy requirement for hydroxy-l-lysine transport and by the inhibition of uptake by l-arginine as well as by l-lysine. the affinity of both systems appears to be considerably lower for hydroxy-l-lysine than for l-lysine. a mutant of s. faecalis which is resistant to the growth inhibitory action of hydroxy-l-lysine appears to differ from the parent strain by having a defective l-lysine-specific transport system.  in this mutant, hydroxy-l-lysine is not readily transported via the l-lysine-specific system because of the mutation or via the second system because of the high concentration of l-arginine present in the growth medium. this overall lack of transport prevents hydroxy-l-lysine from reaching inhibitory levels within the cell.

TI  == induction and regulation of a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-specific 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase in streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == streptococcus faecalis grown with glucose as the primary energy source contains a single, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (nadp)-specific 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. extracts of gluconate-adapted cells, however, exhibited 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase activity with either nadp or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nad). this was shown to be due to the presence of separate enzymes in gluconate-adapted cells. although both enzymes catalyzed the oxidative decarboxylation of 6-phosphogluconate, they differed from one another with respect to their coenzyme specificity, molecular weight, ph optimum, k(m) values for substrate and coenzyme, and electrophoretic mobility in starch gels. the two enzymes also differed in their response to certain effector ligands. the nadp-linked enzyme was specifically inhibited by fructose-1,6-diphosphate, but was insensitive to adenosine triphosphate (atp) and certain other nucleotides. the nad-specific enzyme, in contrast, was insensitive  to fructose-1,6-diphosphate, but was inhibited by atp. the available data suggest that the nad enzyme is involved primarily in the catabolism of gluconate, whereas the nadp enzyme appears to function in the production of reducing equivalents (nadph) for use in various reductive biosynthetic reactions.

AB  == the mechanism by which agents that inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis produce  a synergistic effect against enterococci when combined with aminoglycoside antibiotics has not been elucidated. using (14)c-labeled streptomycin, it could be shown that uptake of this aminoglycoside antibiotic was markedly enhanced in enterococci growing in the presence of penicillin or other agents which inhibit the synthesis of bacterial cell walls. there was no enhancement of streptomycin uptake when the cells were incubated with antibiotics which primarily affect the  bacterial cell membrane or inhibit protein synthesis. increased streptomycin uptake was produced by penicillin only in actively growing bacteria. these observations are consistent with the hypothesis that enterococci exhibit a natural barrier to the entry of streptomycin which can be overcome by agents which inhibit cell wall synthesis, thus producing a synergistic effect.

AB  == several common strains of bacteria have been studied to determine their influence on human and rabbit platelets in vitro. bacteria at a nominal ratio of 1:1 were added to platelets in their native plasma or to platelets in a balanced salt solution. the platelet-bacterial interaction was examined by nephelometry and by  sequential light microscopy of fixed specimens taken at key points in the reaction. the results support the following conclusions: (1) bacteria that were potent stimuli of the platelet aggregation reaction were incorporated in large numbers into the forming platelet aggregates. (2) bacteria sequestered within platelet aggregates remained in direct contact with the aggregated platelet mass  for up to 1 hour in vitro and during this time showed no morphologic changes by light microscopy. (3) plateletbacterial interaction produced clumping of the bacteria but no demonstrable killing of the microorganisms. (4) collagen-platelet interaction resulted in release of platelet products that were capable of clumping bacteria but were not lethal to them. (5) rabbit and human platelets showed no species differences in plateletbacterial interaction. (6) washed platelets interacted with bacteria without added serum factors but the addition of serum accelerated the aggregation reaction.

AB  == interactions between human platelets and several common species of bacteria have  been studied in vitro by the technic of recording nephelometry. results of this investigation have established the following parameters of platelet-bacterial interaction: (1) bacteria are potent stimuli of the platelet-aggregating reaction. (2) the platelet-bacterial interaction proceeds through four distinct phases which are separable by varying the platelet-bacterial ratios or adding appropriate chemical inhibitors. (3) the degree and rate of the platelet response is proportional to the ratio of bacteria to platelets. (4) direct contact between platelets and bacteria, physiologic levels of divalent cations and nucleotide release from platelets are essential for aggregation of platelets by bacteria. (5) by adding equivalent numbers of six species of microorganisms to platelet-rich plasma, their potency as initiators of the platelet reaction was determined, with staphylococcus being the most powerful.

AB  == a new method for the enumeration of lymphoid cells with specific surface-receptors for antigen is described, based on the use of beta-d-galactosidase (ec 3.2.1.23), either directly as an antigen or as a conjugated antigen. binding of beta-d-galactosidase is revealed by its activity in releasing riboflavin from a synthetic substrate, riboflavin-beta-d-galactopyranoside. the riboflavin, inactive as a vitamin in the galactosidic form, becomes active when released by the enzyme, and can be detected by bioassay. hence, lymphoid cells with receptors for beta-d-galactosidase on their surface can be detected after they have been exposed to the enzyme, washed, and then plated in agar containing riboflavin-beta-d-galactopyranoside, streptomycin, riboflavin-deficient medium, and a streptomycin-resistant strain of streptococcus faecalis that requires riboflavin. release of riboflavin is signalled by the growth of characteristic bacterial colonies over the cell that bound beta-d-galactosidase.

TI  == detection of relationships between streptococcus faecalis and lactobacillus casei by immunological studies with two forms of malic enzyme.
AB  == antisera prepared against two isologous malic enzymes from lactobacillus casei strains 64h and m40 were used to survey and categorize the various malic enzymes  found within this diverse species. in addition to detecting three major antigenic variants of malic enzyme within this group, both antisera readily reacted with streptococcus faecalis malic enzyme. the cross-reactions between the l. casei malic enzyme antisera and the s. faecalis malic enzyme indicated that these iso-functional enzymes found in two apparently diverse groups of organisms were immunologically homologous. a scheme proposing a common ancestry for the two species s. faecalis and l. casei based on the results of quantitative immunological studies is presented.

TI  == studies on the absorption and metabolism of folic acid. i. folate absorption in the dog after exposure of isolated intestinal segments to synthetic pteroylpolyglutamates of various chain lengths.
AB  == folic acid absorption was studied in anesthetized dogs by determining the amount  and chemical nature of folate in venous blood emerging from isolated intestinal segments containing free folic acid and/or pteroylpolyglutamates of a known chain length. chromatographically pure test materials placed in the lumen were prepared by unambiguous solid phase synthetic methods. this synthetic procedure not only yields compounds of known structure, it also provides a means by which glutamic acid residues at any given position in the gamma glutamyl chain can be made radioactive. for example, teropterin (pteroyltriglutamate) was synthesized in such a way that (14)c was present only in the middle glutamic acid unit. suitable placement of label permitted assessment of the extent of peptide cleavage. the action of plasma conjugase was inhibited by copper chloride. plasma samples were  analyzed by lactobacillus casei and streptococcus faecalis assay, by column chromatography, and by quantitative measurement of pteridine-bound radioactivity. it was observed that biologically active folate appeared in the mesenteric vein with either pteroylmono-, di-, tri-, penta-, or heptaglutamate in the lumen. generally speaking the absorption rate appeared to be inversely related to the length of the gamma glutamyl side chain. roughly twice as much folic acid appeared in the circulation from (3)h-labeled pteroylmonoglutamate as from (14)c-labeled pteroylpentaglutamate when equimolar amounts of each were placed simultaneously in a single intestinal segment. pteroylmonoglutamate appeared to be the predominant form entering the blood from each of the precursors tested. however, evidence was obtained that pteroyldiglutamate may enter the mesenteric vein soon after placing pteroyldi-, or triglutamate in the lumen, but not with the higher polyglutamates. comparison of radioactivity and biological activity patterns suggests little conversion, if any, to reduced or methylated forms during the first 30 min of passage through the intestinal mucosa. we conclude that both pteroylmonoglutamates and pteroyldiglutamates may across the intestinal mucosa of the dog, and that reduction and methylation are not essential to the absorption process.

TI  == media exchange method for demonstrating killing of l-phase variants in solid media by normal human serum.
AB  == normal human serum has been shown to kill l-phase variants in a fluid system by the action of antibody plus complement. previous studies, however, failed to demonstrate such killing in solid media. this failure probably resulted from inhibition of complement by medium components such as agar and nacl. a method was developed which circumvents the problems of the anticomplementary properties of agar media and the requirement of some l-phase variants for concentrations of salt that inhibit complement. using this method, we have demonstrated in solid media the killing by normal human serum of the l-phase variants of staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus pyogenes, s. faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhi. this method provides a relatively simple and graphic means for studying host humoral factors lethal for l-phase variants.

TI  == an enzyme-based theory of obligate anaerobiosis: the physiological function of superoxide dismutase.
AB  == the distribution of catalase and superoxide dismutase has been examined in various micro-organisms. strict anaerobes exhibited no superoxide dismutase and,  generally, no catalase activity. all aerobic organisms containing cytochrome systems were found to contain both superoxide dismutase and catalase. aerotolerant anaerobes, which survive exposure to air and metabolize oxygen to a  limited extent but do not contain cytochrome systems, were found to be devoid of  catalase activity but did exhibit superoxide dismutase activity. this distribution is consistent with the proposal that the prime physiological function of superoxide dismutase is protection of oxygen-metabolizing organisms against the potentially detrimental effects of the superoxide free radical, a biologically produced intermediate resulting from the univalent reduction of molecular oxygen.

TI  == vitamin b12 uptake by intestinal microorganisms: mechanism and relevance to syndromes of intestinal bacterial overgrowth.
AB  == the mechanism of bacterial uptake of vitamin b(12), the spectrum of microorganisms capable of such uptake, and the factors involved were the subject  of this study. bacterial uptake of vitamin b(12) was found to be at least a two stage process. a primary uptake phase which was rapid (1 min or less), ph dependent, nontemperature dependent, did not require viable organisms and was insensitive to either the metabolic inhibitor dinitrophenol or to the sulfhydryl  inhibitor n-ethyl-maleimide. protein denaturation (formalin treatment or autoclaving) abolished all b(12) uptake. this primary uptake phase is thought to  represent adsorption to binding or "receptor" sites on the cell wall. second stage uptake was slower, ph and temperature dependent, required living bacteria,  and was abolished by either dinitrophenol or n-ethyl-maleimide. this phase is dependent upon metabolic processes and may reflect transfer of b(12) from surface "receptor" sites into the bacterial cell. although differences among organisms were observed in total 1 hr uptake, number of surface "receptor" sites, and relative avidities for b(12), all organisms except streptococcus fecalis shared the two stage mechanism. two gram-positive organisms. bacillus subtilis and group a streptococcus, demonstrated the highest 1 hr vitamin b(12) uptake values; gram-negative bacteria required 2,000-10,000 the number of organisms for comparable uptake. binding constants (k(m)) varied from 5.05 +/-1.67 x 10(-10)m for b. subtilis to 6.18 +/-3.08 x 10(-9)m for klebsiella pneumoniae which approximate the km for human intrinsic factor (0.38 x 10(-10)m). competition between bacteria and intrinsic factor for vitamin b(12) may be inferred from the  similarity of these constants. these observations suggest that a variety of enteric and nonenteric organisms, not requiring exogenous b(12), may play a role  in the pathogenesis of the vitamin b(12) malabsorption found in the intestinal bacterial overgrowth syndromes.

TI  == mechanism for regulating the distribution of glucose carbon between the embden-meyerhof and hexose-monophosphate pathways in streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == glucose-adapted streptococcus faecalis produced little if any (14)co(2) from glucose-1-(14)c, although high levels of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (ec 1.1.1.49) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (ec 1.1.1.44) were detected in cell-free extracts. metabolism of glucose through the oxidative portion of the hexose-monophosphate pathway was shown to be regulated in this organism by the specific inhibitory interaction of the embden-meyerhof intermediate, fructose-1,  6-diphosphate (fdp), with 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity was unaffected by fdp. the s. faecalis 6-phosphogluconate  dehydrogenase was partially purified from crude extracts by standard fractionation procedures and certain kinetic parameters of the fdp-mediated inhibition were investigated. the negative effector was shown to cause a decrease in v(max) and an increase in the apparent k(m) for both 6-phosphogluconate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (nadp). these effects were apparently a consequence of the ligand interacting with the enzyme at a site distinct from either the substrate or the coenzyme sites. among the evidence supporting this was the fact that beta-mercaptoethanol blocked completely fdp inhibition, but had no effect on catalytic activity. the possibility that the regulation of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase activity by fdp might be of some general significance was suggested by the observation that this enzyme from several other sources was also sensitive to fdp.

AB  == suspensions of enterococci were treated with lysozyme in the presence of osmotic  stabilizers. the resulting osmotically fragile bodies prepared from streptococcus faecium strain f24 and s. faecalis strain e1 gave rise to l-forms under optimal osmotic and nutritional conditions for treatment and subsequent growth. the most  critical component of the growth medium, to obtain maximum yields, was the nature and concentration of the added salt. the two most effective salts were sodium chloride and ammonium chloride in the range of 2 to 3% (w/v) added to a suitable  agar base. ammonium chloride was more versatile, because it could be used with either sucrose or polyethylene glycol 4000 as the osmotic stabilizer for preparation and dilution of the osmotically fragile bodies. sodium chloride would not consistently support growth of s. faecium f24 as l-forms when polyethylene glycol 4000 was used as the osmotic stabilizer during lysozyme treatment. time-course studies of concurrent cell wall removal and l-form induction suggested that maximal induction required only cell wall damage rather than complete wall removal. this method for induction of l-forms from a suspension of  enterococci is a significant improvement over other presently known methods.

AB  == low concentrations of glutaraldehyde (0.1% or higher) blocked cellular and wall autolysis. the site of autolytic activity was studied by allowing cell autolysis  to proceed for very short periods (0 to 15 min) before addition of glutaraldehyde. electron microscopy of ultrathin sections showed that the primary site of autolytic activity was the leading edge of the nascent cross wall. the base of the cross wall seemed more resistant than the tip. evidence supporting the involvement of autolysin activity in continued wall extension and in cell separation as well as in the initiation of new sites of wall extension was obtained. in cells exposed for 10 min to chloramphenicol, wall dissolution was very much slower but occurred at the same cross wall site.

TI  == relationship between the location of autolysin, cell wall synthesis, and the development of resistance to cellular autolysis in streptococcus faecalis after inhibition of protein synthesis.
AB  == ten minutes after inhibition of protein synthesis with chloramphenicol (cap) the  ability of cells of streptococcus faecalis (atcc 9790) to autolyze decreased to less than 20% of the rate for exponential-phase cells. after threonine exhaustion, the time for a 50% drop in the rate of cellular autolysis was about 20 min. these rapid increases in resistance to cellular autolysis could not be accounted for by: (i) the relatively slow and small overall decrease in susceptibility of isolated cell walls to added autolysin, or (ii) a decreased content of either the active or latent (proteinase activatable) form of the autolysin in the wall fraction. continued wall synthesis resulted in dilution of  preexisting autolysin in the isolated wall fraction. the release of labeled "old" relative to "new" wall from cap-treated cultures showed that wall synthesis shifted away from the areas of wall previously shown to be associated with wall synthesis (extension) in exponential-phase cells. a corresponding dispersal of active autolysin activity was not observed. by using actinomycin d and cap, a requirement for ribonucleic acid and protein synthesis early in the recovery of cells from amino acid starvation was demonstrated for the recovery in the ability of cells to autolyze. evidence was obtained which suggests that a protein is involved in the conversion of latent to active autolysin. during recovery from amino acid starvation, increase in wall synthesis and content of active autolysin was delayed (25 to 35 min), whereas an increase in turbidity and latent enzyme content began within 10 min. after treatment with cap at 22 or 52 min of recovery, a further increase in levels of both active and latent autolysin was severely inhibited; however, the increase in rate of wall synthesis was indistinguishable from that of an untreated control. this suggests that an increase in rate of wall synthesis does not depend on an increase in level of active autolysin.

TI  == early changes in the ultrastructure of streptococcus faecalis after amino acid starvation.
AB  == thin sections of streptococcus faecalis (atcc 9790) starved of one essential amino acid (threonine or valine) initially show rapid increases in (i) cell wall  thickness, (ii) the apparent size of the central nucleoid region, and (iii) mesosomal membranes. the most rapid increases in all three variables occurred during the first 1 to 2 hr of starvation. after this initial period, the rates progressively decreased over the 20-hr observation period. during threonine starvation, the mesosomal membrane that accumulated in the first hour was subsequently degraded and reached a level similar to that found in exponential-phase cells after 20 hr. with valine starvation, mesosomal membrane continued to slowly accumulate over the entire 20-hr observation period. the mesosomes of the starved cells retained the same "stalked-bag" morphology of those in exponential-phase cells. these cytological observations agree with previously published biochemical data on membrane lipid and wall content after starvation.

AB  == comparisons of the starch-gel patterns of uninoculated aseptic control samples from rabbit and pig muscle with similar samples inoculated and incubated with clostridium perfringens, salmonella enteritidis, achromobacter liquefaciens, and  kurthia zopfii were made. results indicated that c. perfringens caused extensive  alteration in the proteins or enzymes, or both, of the sarcoplasmic fraction of porcine muscle, whereas s. enteritidis and s. faecalis caused complete breakdown  of only myoglobin. neither a. liquefaciens nor k. zopfii showed any measurable amount of proteolysis in the sarcoplasmic fraction from pig muscle. although some of the bands in the starch-gel pattern of rabbit muscle decreased in size and intensity of staining, complete proteolysis of any protein fraction was absent for all test organisms. the disc-gel patterns of the 8 m urea-soluble proteins showed that c. perfringens caused extensive proteolysis in pig muscle and a lesser extent of proteolysis in rabbit muscle. none of the other organisms utilized in this study had any measurable effect upon the urea-soluble proteins.  in addition, a simple procedure for aseptic isolation of muscle samples for studying meat spoilage is outlined. results indicate that careful sanitation and  cleanliness will give suitable samples for meat spoilage investigations.

TI  == carbon dioxide fixation by extracts of streptococcus faecalis var. liquefaciens.
AB  == extracts of cells of streptococcus faecalis var. liquefaciens strain 31 incorporated (14)co(2) into aspartate. dialyzed extracts produced radioactive oxalacetate in the absence of exogenously added glutamate and pyridoxal-5'-phosphate and produced radioactive aspartate in the presence of these components. reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide or reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate could not be substituted for adenosine triphosphate (atp); phosphoenolpyruvate even in the presence of nucleoside diphosphates could not replace pyruvate plus atp; propionate plus coenzyme a (coa) could not replace pyruvate in supporting co(2) fixation by cell  extracts. fixation by dialyzed cell extracts required pyruvate, atp, mgso(4), and was stimulated by biotin, kcl, 2-mercaptoethanol, coa, and acetyl coa. inhibition of fixation occurred when avidin, nacl, oxalacetate, or aspartate was added to dialyzed extracts. on the basis of the products formed and the effects of substrates and cofactors on the fixation reaction, it was concluded that pyruvate carboxylase is responsible for co(2) fixation in this microorganism.

TI  == effect of ph of medium and size of inoculum on activity of antibiotics against group d streptococcus (enterococcus).
AB  == seventy-one clinical isolates of 5 species of group d streptococcus (enterococcus) were tested for susceptibility to 15 antibiotics at ph 5.0, 7.4, and 8.5. penicillin g, ampicillin, cephalothin, cephaloridine, and novobiocin were considerably more active against all strains at ph 5.0 than in the more alkaline media. on the other hand, lincomycin, clindimycin, erythromycin, and gentamicin were moderately to markedly more active at ph 8.5. no important differences were noted in the susceptibility of the strains to kanamycin and streptomycin, at the ph levels tested, but the organisms were quite resistant to  them in these tests. the various species differed quantitatively in their susceptibility to the individual drugs and in the effects of ph. the size of the  inoculum also had a variable effect on susceptibility, depending on the species of enterococcus, the antibiotics, and the ph of the test medium. the data suggest that, in the antibiotic treatment of urinary tract infections caused by enterococcus, attempts should be made to achieve the optimum ph in the urine, particularly in view of the fact that organisms of this group are often resistant to several antibiotics in the usual tests.

TI  == purificationa and properties of a fructose-1,6-diphosphate-activated lactate dehydrogenase from streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == an l-(+)-lactate dehydrogenase was purified approximately 35-fold from crude extracts of streptococcus faecalis. the purified enzyme had an absolute and specific requirement for fructose-1,6-diphosphate (fdp) for catalytic activity. the concentration of fdp required for 50% maximal activity was about 0.045 mm. the activator was bound to the enzyme more effectively at ph 5.8 than it was at a neutral or alkaline ph. activation appeared to involve a conformational change in the enzyme which made the substrate and coenzyme sites more accessible to the respective reactants. among the evidence supporting this hypothesis was the fact  that fdp lowered significantly the apparent k(m) for both pyruvate and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. moreover, the enzyme, which was quite heat stable in the absence of any of the reactants, was rendered heat labile by fdp.

TI  == model for cell wall growth of streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == in exponentially growing and dividing cells of streptococcus faecalis, it is proposed that the leading edge of the annularly closing cross wall is the point of extension for both cross wall and peripheral wall. peripheral wall extension is thought to be produced by the separation or splitting of the cross wall at its junction with peripheral wall. this results in the pushing of the equatorial wall bands, found on s. faecalis walls, to subsequatorial positions. these bands therefore mark the separation of old wall from new wall. mesosomal formation was  observed usually to precede cross wall initiation.

AB  == glycolyzing cells of streptococcus faecalis accumulate k(+) with concurrent extrusion of equivalent amounts of h(+) and na(+). an attempt was made to clarify the retionship between the movements of na(+) and k(+). sodium was displaced from cells glycolyzing in the presence of ammonia, diethylamine, tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, and other nitrogenous cations; by contrast, k(+) was completely retained. accumulation of k(+) by heterologous exchange for na(+)  was not inhibited by antibiotics which facilitate diffusion of k(+) across the membrane, but was blocked by proton conductors. the results indicate that extrusion of na(+) and h(+) from the cells is a primary, energy-linked process which generates an electrical potential (interior negative); k(+) accumulation occurs in response to this potential. two mutants deficient in k(+) accumulation  and retention were examined in terms of this model. one mutant is apparently defective in exchange of k(+) for h(+). in the other mutant, exchange of k(+) for na(+) is impaired.

AB  == a 10-hr starvation of streptococcus faecalis atcc 9790 for the amino acids methionine and threonine results in cells which are resistant to autolysis and which contain greatly reduced quantities of both active and latent (proteinase activable) forms of the autolytic enzyme (an n-acetyl-muramide glycanhydrolase).  cell walls were isolated from cells harvested at various times during the recovery from such starvation and were assayed for active and latent forms of the autolysin. within 10 min of recovery the latent enzyme began to increase. only after 30 to 60 min did the active enzyme begin to increase; after a similar lag,  the cells' proneness to lysis markedly increased. the intracellular localization  of both forms of the autolysin was examined, using as an experimental tool the ability of added cell wall to bind autolysin. (14)c-lysine-labeled, inactivated cell walls were added to exponential-phase cells, which were then disrupted, and  the mixed wall population was isolated. measurement of the (14)c release during wall autolysis indicated that the active enzyme in the cells was not available for binding to the added (14)c-labeled walls and was therefore wall-bound in vivo. in contrast, up to 85% of latent autolysin activity was found to have been  efficiently bound to the added (14)c walls. the results obtained suggest (i) cellular autolysis is a reflection of the level of active enzyme and not of latent enzyme, and (ii) autolysin is synthesized and mainly located in the cytoplasm as an inactive latent precursor (proenzyme) which is transported to sites on the cell wall associated with wall biosynthesis, where it becomes activated.

AB  == a solubilized nonparticulate adenosine triphosphatase from streptococcus fecalis  spheroplast membranes (abrams, a., and c. baron, biochemistry, 7,501 (1968)) interacts at ph 7.5 with lipid bilayer membranes to produce a 10(2)- to 10(4)-fold increase in the electric conductance of the bilayer. in addition, a small decrease in the electrical capacitance of the interactant system is also observed. interaction is obtained with bilayers formed from a solution in n-decane of either purified egg phosphatidyl-choline, synthetic diphytanoyl phosphatidyl-choline, or a total extract of the membrane lipid of s. fecalis. the magnitude of the increase in conductance is dependent on the presence of mg(++) and upon the concentrations of both na(+) and k(+) in the range of 10(-2) to 10(-1)m. an additional tenfold increase in conductance is obtained when atp is added to the ambient aqueous phase surrounding the bilayer atpase interactant system. no conductance change is obtained with atpase which has been treated with pronase. atpase activity is dependent upon mg(++) and upon the concentrations of  na(+) and k(+) in the region of 10(-1)m. the function of the atpase in the intact bacterial membrane is apparently associated with the active transport of cations. the increased conductance in the bilayer which results from its interaction with  the atpase, together with the similarity between the dependence of this interaction and the dependence of atpase activity on mg(++), atp, and the na(+),  k(+) concentrations suggests that the bilayer-atpase interactant complex may be similar in structure and properties to the membrane-atpase complex in the intact  organism.

AB  == exploration of the specific role of cystine in the postexponential growth of streptococcus faecalis led to an inquiry into the fate of cellular coenzyme a (coa) and acyl carrier protein (acp), both of which depend for their biosynthesis on cystine and pantothenate as precursors. in s. faecalis cells labeled by growth in the presence of (14)c-pantothenate, the label could be separated on the basis  of solubility at ph 2.1 into two fractions of sharply differing metabolic characteristics. the fractions were not purified, but the soluble (14)c behaved analytically like coa, and the insoluble (14)c was considered to represent an acp-like entity on the basis of circumstantial evidence. the fate of these two fractions under various conditions of growth was studied. when the medium contained an excess of the needed precursors, the cellular content of coa and acp appeared to remain constant during exponential growth, and in a molar ratio of about 4 coa to 1 acp. cellular acp, once formed, appeared to be stable under these conditions, but coa was degraded and replaced at the rate of approximately  20% per division period. with restrictive levels of pantothenate in the medium, initially formed coa disappeared during growth, as a result, apparently of being  converted to acp. however, when the resulting coa-depleted cells were returned to a medium containing enough pantothenate, resumption of normal growth was preceded by a lag period, during which rapid conversion of acp to coa appeared to take place.

AB  == cell walls from exponential-phase cultures of streptococcus faecalis atcc 9790 contain an autolysin (a beta-n-acetylmuramide glycanhydrolase, e.c. 3.2.1.17) which has been isolated from trypsin-speeded wall autolysates. the autolysin, which was excluded from bio-gel p-60, was further fractionated by diethylaminoethyl (deae)-cellulose chromatography or filtration on bio-gel p-200. after deae-cellulose chromatography, which removed most of the wall polysaccharide, autolysin activity was extremely labile and was rapidly lost at -20 c, even in the presence of albumin. the p-60-excluded enzyme was rapidly bound by walls at both 37 c (50% bound in about 1 min) and 0 c (50% bound in less than 4 min). wall-bound autolysin could not be removed by 1.0 m ammonium acetate  (ph 6.9). autolysin was also bound by walls that had been extracted with 10% trichloroacetic acid or treated with 0.01 n periodate, suggesting that the nonpeptidoglycan wall polymers are not important for binding. wall-bound autolysin was more stable than the soluble enzyme to proteinase digestion, acetone (40%), 8 m urea (at 0 c), or to inactivation at 56 c. two bacterial neutral proteinases (which do not hydrolyze ester bonds) activated latent wall-bound autolysin, suggesting that activation results from the cleavage of one or more peptide bonds. the group a streptococcal proteinase activated latent autolysin but differed from the other proteinases in that it did not inactivate soluble autolysin. the results suggest that the autolysin is not covalently linked to the wall. the high affinity of the walls for the autolysin appears to be responsible for the firm, not easily reversed binding.

TI  == a study of folate absorption and metabolism in man utilizing carbon-14--labeled polyglutamates synthesized by the solid phase method.
AB  == the absorption and metabolism of synthetic polyglutamates of folic acid have been compared with free pteroylglutamic acid in four subjects having chronic lymphatic leukemia and one with hodgkin's granuloma. pteroylpolyglutamates containing either three or seven glutamate residues were prepared by the solid-phase method  permitting placement of carbon-14 labels in either the pteridine ring or in a selected glutamate unit of the gamma peptide chain. complete dissociation was observed between biological folate activity and radioactivity of plasma after ingestion of pteroyltriglutamate labeled in the middle glutamate. this indicates  cleavage to the monoglutamate form at the time of absorption from the intestine or very soon thereafter. a large portion of radioactivity liberated from the middle glutamate is recoverable as carbon dioxide in the exhaled air. fecal losses of folate tended to be greater with increasing length of the poly-gamma-glutamyl chain. higher blood levels and greater urinary losses of folate tended to occur after ingestion of mono- and triglutamates than with the heptaglutamate. calculations based on radioactivity determinations in feces plus  urinary folate losses, judged by either radioactivity or microbiological assays,  indicated net retention of 37-67% of the dose irrespective of chain length ingested and major avenue of loss. during the peak of absorption the folate circulating in plasma was active for both streptococcus fecalis and lactobacillus casei and carried specific radioactivity which was virtually identical with that  of the administered dose. this suggests that neither methylation, conjugation, nor displacement of nonradioactive folate occurred to any significant extent during the 1st 2 hr. the specific radioactivity of 24-hr urine specimens as measured with l. casei corresponded closely with that of the administered dose. evidence exists that methylation of the radioactive folate may occur, but significant displacement of nonradioactive methylfolate was not observed under the conditions of this study. since 50-75% of administered heptaglutamate appears to be absorbable in man, estimates of dietary intake should include this fraction as well as the "free" folate.

TI  == antipseudomonal activity of alpha-sulfoaminopenicillins.
AB  == a series of penicillins characterized by the presence of a sulfoamino or a modified sulfoamino group in the side chain was subjected to in vitro antimicrobial screening tests. although the most potent members of the series were less active than benzylpenicillin against gram-positive bacteria and comparably active against most gram-negative bacteria, they were, on the average, 8 to 16 times more effective against strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa. in other  comparative laboratory tests against p. aeruginosa, these compounds were about as active as carbenicillin and four to eight times more active than ampicillin. an examination of structure-activity relationships indicated that maximal potency was obtained with penicillins having an alpha-(aromatic or heteroaromatic)-alpha-sulfoaminoacetamido side chain. the compound with an alpha-phenyl group was comparable in activity to those having an alpha-(2- or 3-thienyl) group, whereas any modification in position or structure of the alpha-sulfoamino group reduced activity. results of studies with a cell-free p. aeruginosa beta-lactamase suggest that the marked inhibitory effects of alpha-sulfoamino penicillins for p. aeruginosa can be attributed, at least in part, to their high degree of resistance to this enzyme. some derivatives, however, had weak antipseudomonal activity, despite possessing a high degree of beta-lactamase resistance.

TI  == malate utilization by a group d streptococcus: physiological properties and purification of an inducible malic enzyme.
AB  == growth of streptococcus faecalis in the presence of l-malate resulted in the induction of a "malic enzyme" [l-malate:nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nad) oxidoreductase (decarboxylating), e.c. 1.1.1.39]. synthesis of the malic enzyme did not appear to be subject to catabolite repression by intermediate products of glucose or fructose dissimilation. however, malate utilization was inhibited during growth in the presence of glucose or fructose. the purified enzyme was specific for malate as substrate and nad as cofactor. mn(+2) or mg(+2) was required for optimal activity and nh(4)cl stimulated the reaction rate. several lines of indirect evidence suggested that the streptococcal malic enzyme was involved primarily with energy production and not biosynthesis.

TI  == dependence of protease secretion by streptococcus faecalis var. liquefaciens on arginine and its possible relation to site of synthesis.
AB  == washed cells of streptococcus faecalis var. liquefaciens, when harvested from media that supported protease biosynthesis, continued to release this extracellular enzyme in phosphate buffer. the addition of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta) halted the secretion. if zinc ions were added to the edta-treated cells before 45 to 60 min had elapsed, a fraction of the anticipated enzyme activity was observed. after 60 min, arginine and phosphate, in addition to zinc, were necessary for the demonstration of proteolytic activity. the enzyme that was released was newly formed, because chloramphenicol, puromycin, or actinomycin d prevented its appearance. energy for this synthetic reaction was obtained, apparently, from arginine; lactose could not be substituted for arginine. this last point is interpreted to mean that extracellular protease biosynthesis occurs in a localized area or cellular compartment into which the adenosine triphosphate derived from the fermentation of lactose cannot diffuse. no evidence was found for a protease zymogen, although this possibility is not completely precluded.

TI  == role of pyruvate metabolism in the growth of streptococcus faecalis in the presence of propionate.
AB  == the growth of streptococcus faecalis is inhibited by propionate, and the inhibition is reversed by lipoic acid or acetate. a study of the role of pyruvate oxidation in s. faecalis showed that propionate inhibited the lipoic acid-dependent aerobic oxidation of pyruvate in resting cells. pyruvate dehydrogenation with neotetrazolium as a hydrogen acceptor in cell-free extracts  also required lipoic acid and was markedly inhibited by propionyl phosphate as well as sodium propionate. some lipid substances, such as palmitate, oleate, behenate, and lecithin, had a lipoic acid-replacing effect on growth of the organism. biotin or bicarbonate promoted the lipoic acid-dependent growth. acetate-2-(14)c added to the medium was mainly incorporated into the lipid fraction of the cells. evolution of (14)co(2) from pyruvate-2-(14)c was not observed in resting cells of the organism, even under aerobic conditions. from the above findings, it is concluded that lipid synthesis through pyruvate oxidation plays a very important role in bacterial growth in medium containing propionate.

TI  == bacteriocin (hemolysin) of streptococcus zymogenes.
AB  == the sensitivity of streptococcus faecalis (attc 8043) to s. zymogenes x-14 bacteriocin depends greatly on its physiological age. sensitivity decreases from  the mid-log phase on and is completely lost in the stationary phase. the sensitivity of erythrocytes to the hemolytic capacity of the bacteriocin showed considerable species variation. the order of increasing sensitivity was goose < sheep < dog < horse < human < rabbit. however, when red cell stromata were used as inhibitors of hemolysis in a standard system employing rabbit erythrocytes the order of increasing effectiveness was sheep < rabbit < human < horse < goose. when rabbit cells were used in varying concentrations with a constant hemolysin concentration, there was a lag of about 30 min, which for a given hemolysin preparation was constant for all red cell concentrations. furthermore, the rate of hemolysis increased with increasing red cell concentration. if red cells are held constant and lysin varied, the time to reach half-maximal lysis varies directly with lysin but is not strictly proportional. bacterial membranes were one to three orders of magnitude more effective than red cell stromata as inhibitors. the order of increasing effectiveness seems to be escherichia coli <  bacillus megaterium < s. faecalis < micrococcus lysodeikticus. in addition to membranes, a d-alanine containing glycerol teichoic acid, trypsin in high concentration, and deoxyribonuclease also inhibited hemolysis. ribonuclease, d-alanine, l-alanine, dl-alanyl-dl-alanine, n-acetyl-d-alanine, n-acetyl-l-alanine did not inhibit hemolysis.

TI  == inhibition of membrane transport in streptococcus faecalis by uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation and its relationship to proton conduction.
AB  == we studied the effect of compounds that uncouple oxidative phosphorylation on membrane function in streptoccocus faecalis, an organism which relies upon glycolysis for the generation of metabolic energy. at low concentrations (ranging from 10(-7) to 10(-4)m), tetrachlorosalicylanilide, tetramethyldipicrylamine, carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, pentachlorophenol, and dicoumarol strongly inhibited energy-dependent transport of rubidium, phosphate, and certain amino acids. however, these compounds had little effect on the generation of adenosine triphosphate via glycolysis or on its utilization for the synthesis of  macromolecules. they also did not seriously inhibit uptake of those monosaccharides and amino acids which do not require concurrent metabolism. it is proposed that the uncouplers interfere with the utilization of metabolic energy for membrane transport. the uncouplers accelerated the translocation of protons across the cytoplasmic membrane. it appears that a proton-impermeable membrane is required for transport, perhaps, because a proton gradient is involved in the coupling of metabolic energy to the translocation of substrates across the membrane.

AB  == cell walls (log walls) were isolated from cultures of streptococcus faecalis atcc 9790 in the exponential phase of growth. these walls were either allowed to undergo autolytic dissolution (in the presence or absence of trypsin) or wall autolysis was inactivated with sodium dodecylsulfate (sds walls). inactivated walls were treated either with lysozyme or with isolated, partially purified s. faecalis autolysin. during wall lysis, samples were removed, negatively stained with phosphotungstate, and examined in the electron microscope. both lysozyme and isolated autolysin appeared to act over the entire surface of sds walls. after partial dissolution, a fibrous network over the surface was revealed. lysozyme digestion revealed the presence of prominent, highly-contrasted equatorial and subequatorial bands around the walls. after trichloroacetic acid extraction, the  bands were seen less frequently and less distinctly in the partially lysozyme digested walls, suggesting that the bands contained nonpeptidoglycan polymers. in the absence of trypsin (which activates a latent form of the autolysin), autolysis of log walls appeared to start at the equatorial bands and to proceed back towards the apex of the coccus. ribbons of wall material coming off the wide edge of the nearly hemispherical wall fragments were observed. activation of latent autolysis resulted in lytic action over the entire wall surface. the results are consistent with the previously postulated location of active autolysin at the areas of new wall synthesis and the random location of latent autolysin in log walls.

TI  == growth of streptococcus faecalis under high hydrostatic pressure and high partial pressures of inert gases.
AB  == growth of streptococcus faecalis in a complex medium was inhibited by xenon, nitrous oxide, argon, and nitrogen at gas pressures of 41 atm or less. the order  of inhibitory potency was: xenon and nitrous oxide > argon > nitrogen. helium appeared to be impotent. oxygen also inhibited streptococcal growth and it acted  synergistically with narcotic gases. growth was slowed somewhat by 41 atm hydrostatic pressure in the absence of narcotic gases, but the gas effects were greater than those due to pressure. in relation to the sensitivity of this bacterium to pressure, we found that the volume of cultures increased during growth in a volumeter or dilatometer, and that this dilatation was due mainly to  glycolysis. a volume increase of 20.3 +/- 3.6 ml/mole of lactic acid produced was measured, and this value was close to one of 24 ml/mole lactic acid given for muscle glycolysis, and interestingly, close to the theoretic volume increase of activation calculated from the depression of growth rate by pressure.

TI  == molar growth yields as evidence for oxidative phosphorylation in streptococcus faecalis strain 10cl.
AB  == during the aerobic growth of streptococcus faecalis strain 10c1, with limiting levels of glucose as the substrate, a molar growth yield (y) of 58.2 g (dry weight) per mole of glucose was obtained. under these conditions of growth, glucose was dissimilated primarily to acetate and co(2). the incorporation of (14)c-glucose into cell material was no greater under aerobic conditions than during anaerobic growth. assuming an adenosine triphosphate coefficient of 10.5,  the aerobic y cannot be explained solely on the basis of substrate phosphorylation and would appear to substantiate previous enzymatic evidence for  oxidative phosphorylation in this cytochromeless species. with mannitol as the substrate, an aerobic y of 64.6 was obtained. extracts of mannitol-grown cells contained a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nad)-linked mannitol-1-phosphate (m-1-p) dehydrogenase. the difference in aerobic y values with mannitol and glucose as substrates would indicate that the in vivo p/o ratio from the oxidation of reduced nad generated by the oxidation of m-1-p approximates 0.6. the y values with pyruvate and glycerol as substrates under aerobic conditions were 15.5 and 24.7, respectively.

TI  == transport of aminophosphonic acids in lactobacillus plantarum and streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == aminophosphonic acids analogous to glutamic acid, aspartic acid, alanine, and valine were actively accumulated by lactobacillus plantarum. uptake was dependent on the availability of glucose and, in all cases, the estimated intracellular concentrations substantially exceeded extracellular levels. during uptake, there  was little metabolism of tritiated 2-amino-3-phosphonopropionic acid (app), the aspartic acid analogue, and a negligible incorporation of isotope from this substance into the nucleic acid, lipid, protein, or cell wall fractions of the cell. competition studies with app indicated that its transport in l. plantarum and in streptococcus faecalis was antagonized only by structurally related compounds such as glutamic, aspartic, and cysteic acids. kinetic studies showed that app was taken up by a single catalytic system in s. faecalis. a mutant strain of this organism which lacks one of two kinetically distinguishable dicarboxylic amino acid transport systems failed to accumulate measurable amounts of app. these experiments indicate that the aminophosphonic acids are accumulated by the amino acid transport systems in these bacteria with minimal metabolic changes.

TI  == site in cell-free protein synthesis sensitive to diphtheria toxin.
AB  == the effects of diphtheria toxin on cell-free protein synthesis in a bacterial system, and preparations obtained from animals that were sensitive and resistant  to toxin were examined. in the presence of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nad), toxin inhibited the incorporation of amino acids by endogenous and synthetic polynucleotides in both rat liver and guinea pig liver cell-free systems that were exposed to 6 lf units per ml of toxin. a cell-free system derived from streptococcus faecalis was resistant to high concentrations of toxin. dialyzed toxin-antitoxin floccules that are formed in the presence of nad  and the 105,000 x g supernatant fluid from rat liver contain nad. such floccules  are also active in protein synthesis in the absence of added transferase i or ii. an operational model presents the view that the intoxication complex is formed at the ribosomal level and occurs in two steps. first, the toxin molecule binds to transferase ii and alters its stereospecific relationship to transferase i, but it does not result in an inactive complex. second, the stereospecific alteration  in transferase i, but it does not result in an inactive complex. second, the stereospecific alteration in transferase ii caused by the binding of diphtheria toxin allows nad to bridge between transferase i and ii, which then results in an inactivated complex. the sensitivity of the cell-free system derived from the normally resistant rat implies that in some cells the cell membrane serves as a permeability barrier to the toxin molecule. the resistance of bacterial cell-free protein synthesizing systems to diphtheria toxin may reflect basic differences between transferase enzymes from bacterial and mammalian sources.

AB  == strains of streptococcus faecalis and s. faecium are known to produce ammonia from arginine, but only s. faecalis couples the adenosine triphosphate (atp) produced through the arginine dihydrolase pathway to growth processes. the specific activities of the arginine dihydrolase enzymes were found to be much lower in s. faecium (0.01 to 0.10) than in s. faecalis (0.24 to 1.60). phosphatase activities in both strains were similar (up to 0.11), but equaled or  exceeded the activities of the arginine dihydrolase enzymes in s. faecium. the failure of s. faecium to show increased growth in arginine media is explained on  the basis of low activities of the arginine dihydrolase enzymes coupled with sufficient phosphatase activity to negate any benefit from atp formed.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of erythromycin was markedly enhanced by alkalinization of the culture medium or urine within the clinical range (ph 6.0 to 8.2). this effect was demonstrated against recent isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis. the urine of normal volunteers was made alkaline by ingestion of sodium bicarbonate or acetazolamide (diamox) during administration of 1.0 g of erythromycin every 8 hr; such urine was capable of inhibiting e. coli and k. pneumoniae even when diluted  up to (in one instance) 128 times with broth of the same ph as the urine. undiluted urine of the same subjects, without alkalinization, was seldom capable  of inhibiting these organisms. the range of ph (6.6 to 8.6) over which the antibacterial effect was enhanced coincided with that over which there was decreasing ionization of a basic group.

TI  == molar growth yields of certain lactic acid bacteria as influenced by autolysis.
AB  == molar growth yields determined from batch cultures of streptococcus diacetilactis and s. faecalis were appreciably greater at the peaks of maximal growth than after continued incubation and considerable autolysis. the higher molar growth yields were about equal to those determined in a continuous culture. autolysis during logarithmic growth was minimal. the average y value for adenosine triphosphate (atp), determined by using limiting concentrations of glucose, galactose, lactose, and maltose for growing s. diacetilactis and limiting concentrations of glucose for growing s. lactis, s. cremoris, and s. faecalis, was 17.0. this is close to the y (arginine) value of 17.8 determined with s. faecalis, but 62% greater than the generally accepted value of 10.5. data are presented indicating that the often-used y (atp) value of 10.5 is erroneously low.

TI  == effect of different media on in vitro studies of antibiotic combinations.
AB  == in an effort to determine the adequacy of a standard broth medium in the evaluation of antibiotic combinations, 20 strains of various bacterial species were studied simultaneously in mueller-hinton broth and in freshly drawn human serum from apparently healthy volunteers. studies of growth dynamics by use of the usual plate dilution technique for quantitating colony-forming units were performed with strains of staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible), streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, aerobacter, klebsiella, and proteus mirabilis. a variety of different antibiotics were investigated. with 19 of the 20 strains, interpretations of synergism or antagonism were the same in both media. therefore, despite minor variations when  the same strain was studied in both serum and broth, it is concluded that mueller-hinton broth is an adequate medium for use in studies of chemotherapeutic combinations in vitro. a simplified method for studying bactericidal activity is  described, which is deemed practical for clinical microbiology laboratories and which led to the same conclusions regarding the combinations as were obtained by  the more arduous plate dilution test.

TI  == effect of hydroxylysine on the biosynthesis of lysine in streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == we were able to show that two lysine-independent mutants of streptococcus faecalis atcc 8043 contained the enzymes for the usual bacterial pathway for lysine biosynthesis. because of this synthetic capacity, one mutant, the lys(+)ohlys(s) strain, could not grow in the presence of hydroxylysine without a  lysine supplement. both lysine and hydroxylysine inhibited the first enzyme of the pathway, aspartokinase. unlike the escherichia coli enzyme, s. faecalis dihydrodipicolinic acid synthetase was not inhibited by either lysine or hydroxylysine. both amino acids caused the repression of dihydrodipicolinic acid  synthetase and diaminopimelic acid decarboxylase. failure of lys(+)ohlys(s) strain to grow in hydroxylysine-supplemented medium was caused by the mimicking of lysine control by hydroxylysine. because hydroxylysine could not completely substitute for lysine and lysine could not be synthesized, the organism did not grow. we tested three lysine analogues and found that they prevented lysine-depletion lysis in the lsy(-)ohlys(s) strain, as did hydroxylysine. each analogue seemed to support cell wall mucopeptide synthesis, although ornithine did not. preliminary data indicated that these analogues like hydroxylysine, have growth-inhibitory action on the lys(+)ohlys(s) strain, but not the lys(+)ohlys(r) strain. the nature of the specificity of the lysine-adding enzyme for cell wall mucopeptide synthesis is discussed.

TI  == effects of nigericin and monactin on cation permeability of streptococcus faecalis and metabolic capacities of potassium-depleted cells.
AB  == at a concentration of 10(-6)m, nigericin and monactin inhibited growth of streptococcus faecalis, and the inhibition was reversed by addition of excess k(+). in the presence of certain antibiotics, the cells exhibited increased permeability to certain cations; internal rb(+) was rapidly lost by exchange with external h(+), k(+) rb(+), and, more slowly, with na(+) and li(+). no effect was  observed on the penetration of other small molecules. cation exchanges induced by nigericin and monactin were metabolically passive and apparently did not involve  the energy-dependent k(+) pump. when the cells were washed, the cytoplasmic membrane recovered its original impermeability to cations. by use of monactin, we prepared cells whose k(+) content had been completely replaced by other cations,  and the metabolic characteristics of k(+)-depleted cells were studied. cells containing only na(+) glycolyzed almost as well as did normal ones and, under proper conditions, could accumulate amino acids and orthophosphate. these cells also incorporated (14)c-uracil into ribonucleic acid but incorporation of (14)c-leucine into protein was strictly dependent upon the addition of k(+). when k(+) or rb(+) was added to sodium-loaded cells undergoing glycolysis, these ions  were accumulated by stoichiometric exchange for na(+). from concurrent measurements of the rate of glycolysis, it was calculated that one mole-pair of cations was exchanged for each mole of adenosine triphosphate produced.

TI  == effect of algicidal quaternaries on the germicidal activity of chlorine on swimming pool water.
AB  == the swimming pool water disinfectant test method of the association of official analytical chemists was used to determine the effect of the accepted level of 2 ppm of some commercial quaternary ammonium algicides on the germicidal activity of chlorine. accurate determinations on the amounts of residual available chlorine in chlorine-quaternary mixtures could not be made by the usual chemical  methods. this made it necessary to base all comparisons on the starting concentrations of available chlorine rather than the final concentration as specified in the method employed. no evidence was obtained to support the use of  lower concentrations of residual available chlorine for disinfection in the presence of algicidal quaternaries than those commonly recognized as effective by the american public health association. the rate of kill against the gram-positive test organism streptococcus faecalis was faster in quaternary-chlorine mixtures than in the sodium hypochlorite control solutions. the practical significance of this result in the bench method identified cannot be ascertained in the absence of more sensitive and precise chemical procedures for determining concentrations of residual available chlorine in the presence of  quaternaries or in actual swimming pool tests.

TI  == autolytic enzyme system of streptococcus faecalis. 3. localization of the autolysin at the sites of cell wall synthesis.
AB  == cell walls from exponential-phase cultures of streptococcus faecalis atcc 9790 autolyzed in dilute buffers. walls were isolated from cultures grown in the presence of (14)c-lysine for about 10 generations and then on (12)c-lysine for 0.1 to 0.8 of a generation (prelabeled). these walls released (14)c to the soluble fraction more slowly than they lost turbidity during the initial stages of autolysis. walls isolated from cultures grown in the presence of (14)c-lysine  for only the last 0.1 to 0.4 of a generation (postlabeled) released (14)c to the  supernatant fluid more rapidly than they lost turbidity. autolysin in both pre- and postlabeled walls was inactivated, and such walls were then incubated in the  presence of unlabeled walls containing active autolysin. the inactivated walls lost their (14)c label only very slowly until autolysis of the unlabeled walls was virtually complete and release of soluble autolysin was expected. when this experiment was done in the presence of trypsin, a fourfold increase in the autolysis rate resulted, but the same pattern of (14)c release was observed. a parallel release of (14)c and loss of turbidity from pre- or postlabeled walls was observed upon trypsin "activation" and by addition of isolated soluble autolysin to inactivated walls. we conclude that the wall-bound autolysin acts first on the more recently synthesized portion of the wall. trypsin appears to speed wall autolysis by activating additional latent autolysin in situ at sites in the older portion of the wall.

TI  == energies of activation and uncoupled growth in streptococcus faecalis and zymomonas mobilis.
AB  == growing cultures of streptococcus faecalis at temperatures above 30 c have activation energies for both rates of growth and glycolysis of 10.3 kcal mole(-1), and a constant growth yield; when growth takes place below this temperature, the growth yield decreases and the activation energy for growth increases to 21.1 kcal mole(-1), but the activation energy for glycolysis is unchanged. the adenosine triphosphate pool in the organisms behaves differently above and below 30 c, suggesting that the energetic coupling between anabolism and catabolism is less effective below 30 c. washed suspensions of s. faecalis have repressed glycolytic activity and an activation energy for glycolysis of 15.6 kcal mole(-1) over the whole temperature range studied. growing cultures of  zymomonas mobilis below 33 c have a constant growth yield of 8.3 g (dry weight) of organisms per mole of glucose degraded, and activation energies for both glycolysis and growth of 11.1 kcal mole(-1); above this temperature, the growth yield falls, the activation energy for growth changes to -6.9 kcal mole(-1), but  the activation energy for glycolysis is unchanged, so that the coupling between anabolism and catabolism is less effective above 33 c. the findings support the view that energy turnover in these bacteria is not well regulated.

TI  == role of the phagocyte in host-parasite interactions. xii. hydrogen peroxide-myeloperoxidase bactericidal system in the phagocyte.
AB  == an antimicrobial system in polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmn) consisting of myeloperoxidase and hydrogen peroxide has been proposed. this system appears to be activated during phagocytosis as a result of the stimulated metabolic activities. a lysed-granules (lg) fraction was prepared from guinea pig exudative pmn. lg alone possessed bactericidal activity which was related to the ph of the  reaction; the lower the ph, the more marked the activity. when low concentrations of both h(2)o(2) and lg were combined under conditions where neither factor alone exhibited significant killing power, there was a striking increase in bactericidal activity. this enhanced activity was much greater than an additive effect. the lg-peroxide antibacterial system was most active over a ph range of 4.0 to 6.0. the activity of the lg-peroxide system was essentially abolished by peroxidase inhibitors, nan(3), kcn, and aminotriazole. the antibacterial activity of this system was nonspecific in nature, being equally effective against gram-negative and gram-positive organisms.

TI  == in vivo and in vitro action of norethindrone on staphylococci.
AB  == norethindrone has been examined in vitro for antibacterial activity against 10 microorganisms. turbidimetric techniques were used to assay the antibacterial activity of norethindrone. the organisms tested included staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, micrococcus conglomeratus, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus  faecalis, salmonella typhosa, shigella flexnerii, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and proteus vulgaris. bacteriostatic action was shown only against the gram-positive microorganisms when they were grown anaerobically in tryptic soy broth containing 10 to 50 mug of norethindrone per ml. the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone was exerted primarily during the first 8 hr of incubation and it was reduced by the presence of oxygen. mestranol at a concentration of 1 to 10 mug/ml failed to exert any significant action on s. aureus. however, incorporation of 5 mug of mestranol per ml in the culture medium enhanced the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone on staphylococci. enhancement of the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone could not be obtained by the addition of a concentration of 5 mug/ml of testosterone, 17alpha-estradiol, and 17beta-estradiol. progesterone and 4-pregnen-20beta-ol-3-one under similar conditions showed an additive bacteriostatic effect when they were incorporated into the culture medium containing norethindrone. in vivo studies indicated that  female, adult new zealand rabbits, injected subcutaneously with two injections of 10 to 20 mug of norethindrone, 24 hr apart, and challenged intradermally with s.  aureus 4 hr after the second injection, had fewer lesions with smaller areas of swelling and erythema as compared to control, nontreated rabbits. the protective  effect of norethindrone on the development of staphylococcal lesion seemed related to hormone concentration. thus, it was demonstrated with doses of 20, 15, and 10 mug, but not with doses of 1 and 5 mug. when the lesions were excised 48 to 92 hr after infection and when viable cell counts were made, rabbits treated with norethindrone showed significantly lower staphylococcal counts than the control rabbits. during the 1st day after infection with s. aureus, leukocytic counts of the norethindrone-treated rabbits remained normal, whereas control animals showed elevated leukocytic counts.

TI  == gramicidin, valinomycin, and cation permeability of streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == gramicidin and valinomycin in concentrations of 10(-7) and 10(-6)m, respectively, inhibited the growth of streptococcus faecalis. inhibition of growth was associated with loss of rb(+) and k(+) from the cells, and could be reversed by addition of excess k(+). cells treated with these antibiotics exhibited greatly increased permeability to certain cations; no effect was observed on the penetration of other small molecules. unlike normal cells, cells treated with gramicidin rapidly lost internal rb(+) by passive exchange with external cations, including h(+), all monovalent alkali metals, nh(4) (+), mg(++), and tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane. exchange was rapid even at 0 c and was independent of energy metabolism. the effect of valinomycin was more selective. cellular rb(+) was rapidly displaced by external h(+), k(+), rb(+), and cs(+); other cations were less effective. the exchange was independent of metabolism but strongly affected by temperature. under certain conditions, polyvalent cations inhibited exchange between (86)rb and rb(+) induced by valinomycin. the antibiotic apparently neither stimulates nor inhibits the energy-dependent k(+) pump of s. faecalis, but exerts its effect on the passive permeability of the membrane to cations. the increased permeability to specific cations induced by gramicidin and valinomycin is a sufficient explanation for the inhibition of growth, glycolysis, and other processes.

AB  == techniques for culturing, harvesting, and testing bacteria to evaluate bactericidal chemicals for swimming pools are described. concentrations of 25, 50, and 100 mg of the chlorine stabilizer cyanuric acid per liter increased the time required for a 99% kill of streptococcus faecalis by 0.5 mg of chlorine per  liter at ph 7.4 and 20 c from less than 0.25 min without cyanuric acid to 4, 6, and 12 min, respectively. the effect of concentrations of ammonia nitrogen in the range found in swimming pools on the rate of kill of 0.5 mg of chlorine per liter and of chlorine plus cyanuric acid was tested. at concentrations of ammonia nitrogen greater than 0.05 mg per liter, faster rates of kill of s. faecalis were obtained with 100 mg of cyanuric acid per liter plus 0.5 mg of chlorine per liter than with 0.5 mg of chlorine per liter alone. when water samples from four swimming pools with low ammonia levels were used as test media, 0.5 mg of added chlorine per liter killed 99.9% of the added s. faecalis in less than 2 min, but  water from a pool with a large number of children required 60 to 180 min of treatment.

AB  == in cell-free extracts derived from streptococcus faecalis, protein synthesis directed by endogenous messenger rna increases as the culture ages. the increased activity is accompanied by an increase in the percentage of membranebound ribosomes and by a decrease in ribosomal monomers and subunits. these changes progress against a background of structural and compositional modifications in the membrane. membrane modifications possibly related to endogenously directed protein synthesis in cell-free extracts include: (i) decreased specific activity  of a membrane-associated polynucleotide phosphorylase capable of polysome degradation, and (ii) increased concentrations of certain phospholipids.

AB  == forrest, w. w. (university of adelaide, adelaide, south australia). adenosine triphosphate pool during the growth cycle in streptococcus faecalis. j. bacteriol. 90:1013-1018. 1965.-the adenosine triphosphate (atp) pool has been studied throughout the growth cycle of streptococcus faecalis. normally, the pool is quantitatively related to the concentration of organisms and the growth rate,  but deviations from these relationships can occur without affecting the growth rate of the organisms. a critical concentration of atp seems necessary for exponential growth, and, at lower levels, only linear growth can occur. if no growth can take place, catabolism of added energy source gives rise to a large increase in the pool level. the pool level represents the balance between the demands of the organisms for energy and the supply of energy derived from catabolism of the substrate.

(cornell university, ithaca, n.y.), and e. a. delwiche. distribution and characteristics of the catalases of lactobacillaceae. j. bacteriol. 90:347-351. 1965.-certain strains of lactobacilli and pediococci incorporated hematin during growth, with the concomitant formation of cyanide- and azide-sensitive catalase. three of five strains of lactobacilli and five of 25 strains of pediococci were capable of this biosynthesis. the pediococci required the heme component of blood, whereas the lactobacilli could incorporate  the heme component in the form of purified and solubilized hemin or from blood. in all cases where inhibitor-sensitive enzyme was produced, it was accompanied by the production of inhibitor-insensitive enzyme. in the absence of hematin, only insensitive enzyme was obtained. two catalase-positive strains of streptococcus faecalis were found incapable of the synthesis of a heme-type enzyme, as was one  member of the genus leuconostoc. iron and manganese in the growth medium stimulated the production of the insensitive catalase, but significant quantities of these metals could not be found in a purified enzyme preparation obtained from lactobacillus plantarum. aeration had little or no effect on growth, but it consistently doubled the amount of cyanide- and azide-resistant catalase. by means of conventional enzyme fractionation techniques, it was possible to separate the two different enzymes present in the cell-free extract of a strain of pediococcus homari which had been grown in the presence of blood.

(michigan state university, east lansing), and ralph n. costilow. electron transport in bacillus popilliae. j. bacteriol. 89:271-276. 1965.-bacillus popilliae was found to be unique among aerobic microorganisms in that it was deficient in a hydrogen peroxide-scavenging system. neither catalase  nor peroxidase was found. at the same time, a system for producing hydrogen peroxide during oxidation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nadh(2))  was consistently present in the soluble fraction of extracts of cells from older  cultures. cells harvested from 9-hr cultures did not produce a significant amount of peroxide. the soluble nadh(2) oxidase was apparently a flavoprotein, since it  was stimulated by flavin nucleotides, insensitive to cyanide and azide, and inhibited by atabrine. also, difference spectra demonstrated the presence of a reducible flavin in the soluble fraction of cell extracts. the particulate fraction of cell extracts was shown by difference spectra to contain cytochrome b(1); the strong inhibition of nadh(2) oxidation by cyanide, azide, and carbon monoxide indicated that a terminal cytochrome oxidase was also present. this system was also flavin-dependent, since it was strongly inhibited by atabrine. the specific activity of the nadh(2) oxidase in the particulate fraction was lower in extracts of cells from older cultures than in those from exponentially growing cultures. cytochrome c was not found in extracts of these cells. it is believed that the increased participation of the hydrogen peroxide-generating nadh(2) oxidase in cells of older cultures may be responsible for the rapid loss  in cell viability noted in stationary-phase cultures.

AB  == harold, f. m. (national jewish hospital, denver, colo.). stabilization of streptococcus faecalis protoplasts by spermine. j. bacteriol. 88:1416-1420. 1964.-lysis of protoplasts of streptococcus faecalis subjected to osmotic shock was prevented by the presence of 10(-3)m spermine and other divalent cations. protein and nucleic acids were largely retained, but compounds of low molecular weight were discharged into the medium and the capacity for glycolysis was lost.  under these conditions, spermine was bound to the protoplasts. it could not be removed by washing with water or nonelectrolytes, but was displaced by salts, polyanions, and polycations. removal of the spermine restored the osmotic fragility of the protoplasts, which could once again be protected from lysis by impermeant solutes. protoplasts were also stabilized, in the absence of osmotic shock, by prolonged incubation with cations in 0.5 m sucrose. by either procedure, the protoplasts became resistant not only to osmotic lysis but also to sonic oscillation. it is concluded that the stabilization of protoplasts resulted from ionic binding of the cation to acidic sites on the external surface of the plasma membrane. this conferred upon the membrane additional mechanical strength, perhaps by the cross-linking of subunits, but did not alter its permeability to extracellular solutes.

(the marker is stable through at least five transfers.) the transfer mechanism is not inhibited by deoxyribonuclease, nor is it phage-mediated; genetic transfer is apparently dependent upon cell contact. although kinetic studies have yet to be completed, preliminary data indicate a high efficiency (2.2 per donor cell in some experiments) of transmission. two levels of drug resistance, 7 and 50 mug, were transferred; in each case, recipient cells expressed the donor's degree of resistance.

AB  == a bioassay for tyrothricin, based on a procedure used by szybalski in bacterial resistance studies, was developed. replacement of the tube dilution assay with this procedure represented economy in time and equipment, with a resultant increase in productivity. the procedure involved preparation of special agar plates which provided graded concentrations of tyrothricin along a horizontal axis. a culture dish was inclined, and a base layer of agar, without antibiotic,  was poured to cover the bottom of the dish and allowed to harden. a second layer  of agar, containing 1 ppm of tyrothricin, was poured and allowed to harden with the dish in a level position. diffusion of the antibiotic from the top layer into the bottom layer yielded a concentration gradient. a third thin layer of agar seeded with streptococcus faecalis was poured on the surface. after incubation, a bacterial growth front, representing the minimal effective concentration (mec), developed. the mec is expressed as distance (in millimeters) from the edge of the plate. unknowns were directly related to a standard preparation for calculation of tyrothricin concentration.

(merck sharp & dohme research laboratories, rahway, n.j.) and david hendlin. oxidation of glycerol by streptococcus faecalis. j. bacteriol. 84:1181-1186. 1962.-the nature of the factors in yeast autolysate essential for the oxidation of glycerol by streptococcus faecalis f24 was examined. two factors appear to be involved in the oxidation of glycerol. one factor was shown to be an inducer of the enzyme system required for glycerol oxidation; the other was shown to be alpha-lipoic acid. minute quantities of glucose will "spark" growth of s. faecalis in a medium containing glycerol and acetate as carbon sources, probably  by supplying sufficient energy for induction of the glycerol-oxidation system.

(university of north carolina, chapel hill) and w. r. straughn.  formation of protoplasts from streptococcus faecalis by lysozyme. j. bacteriol. 84:1094-1098. 1962.-incubation of whole cells of streptococcus faecalis f24 in the presence of the crystalline egg-white lysozyme and appropriate sucrose concentration resulted in the formation of discrete spherical structures. on dilution, these osmotically fragile structures lysed immediately. methyl pentose  determinations on isolated cell walls and protoplast membranes verified the presence of rhamnose in the cell walls and its essentially complete absence in protoplast membranes. cell walls were rendered soluble by lysozyme. after lysozyme treatment of cell walls, 96% of the rhamnose present was not sedimented  by centrifugation at 12,500 x g for 30 min. no cell-wall structures were recognized by phasecontrast or electron microscopy. after direct lysis of whole cells of s. faecalis f24 by lysozyme, protoplast membranes were isolated. it is concluded that, in the strain of group d streptococcus studied, lysozyme effectively removes the cell wall.

TI  == growth of streptococcus faecalis var. liquefaciens on plants.
AB  == the proliferation of streptococcus faecalis var. liquefaciens on two varieties of beans, and on corn, rye, and cabbage was investigated. comparisons were made with growth patterns on these same plants exhibited by s. lactis and lactobacillus plantarum. the ability of each of the bacteria to multiply and to spread to new plant parts as they developed from seed was studied under several environmental conditions. plants were grown aseptically in glass culture and in sterilized and  non-sterilized soil in the greenhouse. quantitative estimations of increase in bacterial numbers were made. s. faecalis established commensal growth on each of  five plants, although selectivity was noted for some plant parts. the organism increased in numbers on the plants equally as well as did the control bacteria, both alone, and in competition with the control bacteria and the microflora of the soil.

(university of texas, houston). microbiological assay for thymine using a mutant of streptococcus faecalis. j. bacteriol. 84:17-22. 1962.-a rapid microbiological assay procedure for the determination of thymine was devised. the test organism, streptococcus faecalis akt, a mutant of s. faecalis atcc 8043, gives one-half the maximal growth response to 1.6 mug of thymine (assay range 0.5 to 2.5 mug) or to a molar equivalent (3.2 mug) of thymidine. under these experimental conditions, 80 mug of 5-methylcytosine or 150 mug of thymidylic acid replace the thymine or thymidine requirement of the test organism. addition of a  mixture of adenine, guanine, and xanthine at a level of 40 mug/ml of each or higher to the basal medium, or addition of a mixture of deoxyadenosine and deoxyguanosine at a level of 80 mug/ml of each or higher to the basal medium, inhibited the thymine or thymidine growth response of the organism. thymine activities of rat and chick tissues were determined by this procedure. the data on the recovery of added thymine to tissues gave 84 to 103% recovery. thymus, spleen, small intestine, and ventral prostate were higher in thymine activities as compared with other tissues.

(ii) the addition of a cytoplasmic extract prepared from exponentially growing cells resulted in changes similar to those resulting from the partial withdrawal from the medium of certain nutrients. (iii) the effect of  the cytoplasmic extract could be counteracted by the addition of tryptophan. (iv) a limited survey, including the effects of the rate of exponential growth, mechanical agitation, the presence of indoleacetic acid, indole, kinetin, lysozyme, or ascorbate, disclosed no additional factor which significantly influenced the particle size distribution.
