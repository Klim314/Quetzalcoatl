TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from brazilian water buffalo mozzarella cheese.
AB  == the water buffalo mozzarella cheese is a typical italian cheese which has been introduced in the thriving brazilian market in the last 10 y, with good acceptance by its consumers. lactic acid bacteria (lab) play an important role in the technological and sensory quality of mozzarella cheese. in this study, the aim was to evaluate the diversity of the autochthones viable lab isolated from water buffalo mozzarella cheese under storage. samples were collected in 3 independent trials in a dairy industry located in the southeast region of brazil, on the 28th day of storage, at 4 masculinec. the lab were characterized by gram staining, catalase test, capacity to assimilate citrate, and production of co2 from glucose. the diversity of lab was evaluated by rapd-pcr (randomly amplified  polymorphic dna-polymerase chain reaction), 16s rrna gene sequencing, and by vitek 2 system. twenty lab strains were isolated and clustered into 12 different  clusters, and identified as streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and lactobacillus helveticus. enterococcus species were dominant and  citrate-positive. only the strains of l. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and l. fermentum produced co2 from glucose and were citrate-positive, while l. casei  was only citrate positive. this is the first report which elucidates the lab diversity involved in brazilian water buffalo mozzarella cheese. furthermore, the results show that despite the absence of natural whey cultures as starters in production, the lab species identified are the ones typically found in mozzarella cheese.

TI  == effect of adjuncts on microbiological and chemical properties of scamorza cheese.
AB  == scamorza is a semi-hard, pasta filata cheese resembling low-moisture mozzarella cheese, with a short ripening time (<30d). scamorza has a bland flavor and, to provide diversification from similar cheeses, it was manufactured using 2 types of milk in the current study: 100% italian friesian milk (f) or 90% f and 10% jersey cow milk (mixed, m), and 2 types of starter: streptococcus thermophilus or s. thermophilus with peptidolytic lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus helveticus, and lactobacillus paracasei strains as adjuncts). the cheeses were ripened for 30d. the adjunct did not significantly affect acid production or growth of the primary starter; 2 of the species used in the adjunct (lb. paracasei and lb. helveticus) rapidly colonized the cheese and persisted until the end of ripening, whereas the counts of nonstarter lactic acid bacteria in the control cheese were  low until the end of ripening. the use of adjuncts affected ph, microbial composition (as assessed by both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods), total free amino acid content, and volatile profile (measured using an  electronic nose), whereas milk type had only a minor effect. although differences in primary proteolysis were found, they were probably indirect and related to the effects on ph and moisture. we conclude that, even with a short ripening time (30d), use of a peptidolytic adjunct may significantly affect important features  of scamorza and may be used to create a product that is measurably different from competing products.

TI  == effect of carbon dioxide on sensory attributes, physico-chemical parameters and viability of probiotic l. helveticus mtcc 5463 in fermented milk.
AB  == a carbonated probiotic fermented milk using india's first fully sequenced potential probiotic strain lactobacillus helveticus mtcc 5463 in a combination with streptococcus thermophilus mtcc 5460 was prepared and standardized with respect to carbon dioxide pressure, sugar and salt concentrations based on sensory, physico-chemical and microbial parameters. final optimized product was prepared with 15 % sugar, 0.8 % salt concentration and carbonated at 15 kg cm(-2) pressure which was subsequently subjected to shelf life evaluation for 28 days at 5 +/- 1 degrees c. even though a significant decrease was observed for overall acceptability, the product was acceptable on 28th day of storage. the titratable  acidity, ph and tyrosine value has increased gradually while free fatty acids remained unchanged. the viable lactobaciili and streptococci count decreased from 7.84 to 7.54 and 8.94 to 8.87 log cfu ml(-1) during 28 days of storage, respectively.

TI  == effect of adjuncts on sensory properties and consumer liking of scamorza cheese.
AB  == the present study aimed to evaluate the effect of a peptidolytic adjunct (lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus helveticus, and lactobacillus paracasei), as a tool to accelerate ripening, on sensory properties and acceptability of scamorza  cheese obtained using 2 types of milk (friesian and friesian+jersey) and streptococcus thermophilus as primary starter. a 10-member panel was trained using a specific frame of references and used a specific vocabulary to assess cheese sensory properties through quantitative descriptive analysis (qda), whereas 87 consumers were used to evaluate product acceptability. analysis of variance showed that milk type did not markedly alter cheese sensory properties.  conversely, panelists perceived higher intensities of butter, saltiness, and sweetness flavors in cheese without adjunct culture (st), whereas the addition of the adjunct culture (st+a) induced higher and sourness flavors, oiliness and grainy textures, and lower adhesiveness, moisture, springiness, and tenderness. principal component analysis showed positive relationships between ph and tenderness, sweetness and saltiness and a negative correlation between ph and grainy, oiliness, color and structure uniformity, sourness, and milk. most of the differences observed in qda and most of the relationships observed in the principal component analysis were linked to the higher microbial activity induced by the adjunct culture. independently of milk and starter types, consumers perceived scamorza cheese as characterized by a good eating quality (mean liking  scores were all above the neutral point of the hedonic scale). although st cheeses showed higher values for overall liking, 2 homogeneous groups of consumers were identified using partial least squares regression analysis. one group preferred st cheeses with higher levels of tenderness, adhesiveness, springiness, and moisture in terms of texture, butter in terms of flavor, and sweetness in terms of taste, whereas a second group preferred st+a products characterized by specific attributes of texture (cohesiveness and oiliness), flavor (milk), taste (sourness), and appearance (structure and color uniformity). we conclude that further studies for the development of short-ripened products based on the use of adjunct cultures should be conducted to promote product differentiation and meet the sensory requirements of particular segments of consumers.

TI  == use of probiotics to reduce faecal shedding of shiga toxin-producing escherichia  coli in sheep.
AB  == shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) are zoonotic, foodborne pathogens of humans. ruminants, including sheep, are the primary reservoirs of stec and there is a need to develop intervention strategies to reduce the entry of stec into the food chain. the initiation of the majority of bacterial, enteric infections involves colonisation of the gut mucosal surface by the pathogen. however, probiotic bacteria can serve to decrease the severity of infection via a number of mechanisms including competition for receptors and nutrients, and/or the synthesis of organic acids and bacteriocins that create an environment unfavourable for pathogen development. the aim of the current study was to determine whether the administration of a probiotic mixture to sheep experimentally infected with a non-o157 stec strain, carrying stx1, stx2 and eae  genes, was able to decrease faecal shedding of the pathogen. the probiotic mixture contained lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus and enterococcus faecium. the numbers of non-o157 stec in faecal samples collected from sheep receiving daily doses of the probiotic mixture were significantly lower at the 3rd, 5th and 6th week post-inoculation when compared to the levels recorded in untreated animals. it was concluded that administration of the probiotic mixture reduced faecal shedding of non-o157 stec in sheep, and holds potential as a pre-harvest intervention method to reduce transmission to humans.

TI  == functional screening of antibiotic resistance genes from a representative metagenomic library of food fermenting microbiota.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) represent the predominant microbiota in fermented foods. foodborne lab have received increasing attention as potential reservoir of antibiotic resistance (ar) determinants, which may be horizontally transferred to opportunistic pathogens. we have previously reported isolation of ar lab from the raw ingredients of a fermented cheese, while ar genes could be detected in the final, marketed product only by pcr amplification, thus pointing at the need for  more sensitive microbial isolation techniques. we turned therefore to construction of a metagenomic library containing microbial dna extracted directly from the food matrix. to maximize yield and purity and to ensure that genomic complexity of the library was representative of the original bacterial population, we defined a suitable protocol for total dna extraction from cheese which can also be applied to other lipid-rich foods. functional library screening on different antibiotics allowed recovery of ampicillin and kanamycin resistant clones originating from streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactobacillus helveticus genomes. we report molecular characterization of the cloned inserts, which were fully sequenced and shown to confer ar phenotype to recipient bacteria. we also show that metagenomics can be applied to food microbiota to identify underrepresented species carrying specific genes of interest.

TI  == cell growth and proteolytic activity of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus  helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and streptococcus thermophilus in milk as affected by supplementation with peptide fractions.
AB  == the present investigation examined the effects of supplementation of milk peptide fractions produced by enzymatic hydrolysis on the fermentation of reconstituted skim milk (rsm). changes in ph, cell growth, proteolytic activity, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace)-inhibitory activity were monitored during fermentation of rsm by pure cultures of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus  helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and streptococcus thermophilus. the study showed that supplementation with peptide fractions of different molecular weights did not significantly affect the bacterial growth in  rsm. all bacteria showed an increased proteolytic activity in rsm supplemented with large peptides (>10 kda), and l. helveticus in general exhibited the highest proteolytic activity among the bacteria studied. the ace-inhibitory activity was  observed to be the maximum in rsm supplemented with larger peptides (>10 kda) for all bacteria. the results suggest that proteolysis by bacteria leads to increased production of ace-inhibitory peptides compared to the supplemented peptides produced by enzymatic hydrolysis.

TI  == pyrosequencing analysis of the microbial diversity of airag, khoormog and tarag,  traditional fermented dairy products of mongolia.
AB  == here, we used pyrosequencing to obtain a detailed analysis of the microbial diversities of traditional fermented dairy products of mongolia. from 22 airag (fermented mare's milk), 5 khoormog (fermented camel's milk) and 26 tarag (fermented milk of cows, goats and yaks) samples collected in the mongolian provinces of arhangai, bulgan, dundgobi, tov, uburhangai and umnugobi, we obtained a total of 81 operational taxonomic units, which were assigned to 15 families, 21 genera and 41 species in 3 phyla. the genus lactobacillus is a core  bacterial component of mongolian fermented milks, and lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus kefiranofaciens and lactobacillus delbrueckii were the predominant  species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in the airag, khoormog and tarag samples, respectively. by using this pyrosequencing approach, we successfully detected most lab species that have been isolated as well as seven lab species that have not been found in our previous culture-based study. a subsequent analysis of the  principal components of the samples revealed that l. delbrueckii, l. helveticus,  l. kefiranofaciens and streptococcus thermophilus were the main factors influencing the microbial diversity of these mongolian traditional fermented dairy products and that this diversity correlated with the animal species from which the milk was sourced.

TI  == the naturally competent strain streptococcus thermophilus lmd-9 as a new tool to  anchor heterologous proteins on the cell surface.
AB  == background: from fundamental studies to industrial processes, synthesis of heterologous protein by micro-organisms is widely employed. the secretion of soluble heterologous proteins in the extracellular medium facilitates their recovery, while their attachment to the cell surface permits the use of the recombinant host cells as protein or peptide supports. one of the key points to carry out heterologous expression is to choose the appropriate host. we propose to enlarge the panel of heterologous secretion hosts by using streptococcus thermophilus lmd-9. this lactic acid bacterium has a generally recognised as safe status, is widely used in the manufacture of yogurts, fermented milks and cheeses, and is easy to transform by natural competence. this study demonstrates  the feasibility of secretion of a heterologous protein anchored to the cell surface by s. thermophilus. for this, we used the cell envelope proteinase (cep)  prth of lactobacillus helveticus cnrz32 cirm-bia 103. results: using s. thermophilus lmd-9 as the background host, three recombinant strains were constructed: i) a negative control corresponding to s. thermophilus prts- mutant  where the prts gene encoding its cep was partially deleted; ii) a prth+ mutant expressing the l. helveticus prth pro-protein with its own motif (s-layer type) of cell-wall attachment and iii) a prth+wans mutant expressing prth pro-protein with the lpxtg anchoring motif from prts. the prth+ and prth+wans genes expression levels were measured by rt-qpcr in the corresponding mutants and compared to that of prts gene in the strain lmd-9. the expression levels of both  fused prth ceps genes, regardless of the anchoring motif, reached up-to more than 76% of the wild-type prts expression level. ceps were sought and identified on the cell surface of lmd-9 wild-type strain, prth+ and prth+wans mutants using shaving technique followed by peptide identification with tandem mass spectrometry, demonstrating that the heterologous secretion and anchoring of a protein of more than 200 kda was efficient. the anchoring to the cell-wall seems  to be more efficient when the lpxtg motif of prts was used instead of the s-layer motif of prth. conclusions: we demonstrated s. thermophilus lmd-9 could heterologously secrete a high molecular weight protein and probably covalently anchor it to the cell-wall.

TI  == characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from artisanal travnik young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks over four seasons.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the composition of lactic acid bacteria  (lab) in autochthonous young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks produced in  the vlasic mountain region of central bosnia and herzegovina near the town of travnik over a four season period. these three products were made from cow's milk by a traditional method without the addition of a starter culture. preliminary characterization with phenotype-based assays and identification using rep-pcr with a (gtg)5 primer and 16s rdna sequence analysis were undertaken for 460 lab isolates obtained from all the examined samples. fifteen species were identified  as follows: lactococcus lactis, lactococcus raffinolactis, lactococcus garviae, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus helveticus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus italicus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, leuconostoc lactis, streptococcus thermophilus and streptococcus mitis. a wide genotypic and  phenotypic heterogeneity of the species was observed, particularly within the lc. lactis strains. in all of the tested dairy products across four seasons, a significantly positive correlation (r = 0.690) between the presence of lactococci and enterococci and a negative correlation (r = 0.722) between the presence of lactococci and leuconostocs were recorded. forty-five percent of the lactobacilli and 54.4% of the lactococci exhibited proteolytic activity, whereas 18.7% of the  total lab isolates exhibited antimicrobial activity.

TI  == microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of may bryndza cheese.
AB  == diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of may bryndza cheese, a traditional slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, e. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16s rdna and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. the culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese,  lactobacilli, lactococci and geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) cfu/g, 10(9) cfu/g and 10(5) cfu/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. the diversity of bacteria encompassed acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter guillouiae, acinetobacter sp., acinetobacter johnsonii, citrobacter braakii, clostridium bartlettii, corynebacterium callunae, corynebacterium maris, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter asburiae, enterobacter hormaechei, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus pallens, escherichia  coli, haemophilus haemolyticus, hafnia alvei, kluyvera cryocrescens, lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus garvieae, lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "leuconostoc garlicum", mannheimia glucosida, mannheimia haemolytica, pseudomonas sp., ps. fluorescens, "ps. reactans", raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, "rothia arfidiae", staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis, staph. felis, staph. pasteuri, staph. sciuri, staph. xylosus, streptococcus parauberis, str. thermophilus and variovorax paradoxus. the diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed alternaria alternata, "ascomycete sp.", aspergillus fumigatus, beauveria brongniartii, candida xylopsoci, c. inconspicua, cladosporium cladosporioides, debaromyces hansenii, fomes fomentarius, galactomyces candidus, gymnoascus reesii, chaetomium globosum, kluyveromyces marxianus, metarhizium anisopliae, penicillium aurantiogriseum, p. camemberti, p. freii, p. polonicum, p. viridicatum, pichia kudriavzevii, sordaria alcina, trichosporon lactis and yarrowia lipolytica.

TI  == microbiological, physico-chemical, nutritional and sensory characterization of traditional matsoni: selection and use of autochthonous multiple strain cultures  to extend its shelf-life.
AB  == matsoni, a traditional georgian fermented milk, has variable quality and stability besides a short shelf-life (72-120 h at 6 degrees c) due to inadequate  production and storage conditions. to individuate its typical traits as well as select and exploit autochthonous starter cultures to standardize its overall quality without altering its typicality, we carried out a thorough physico-chemical, sensorial and microbial characterization of traditional matsoni. a polyphasic approach, including a culture-independent (pcr-dgge) and two pcr culture-dependent methods, was employed to study the ecology of matsoni.  overall, the microbial ecosystem of matsoni resulted largely dominated by streptococcus (s.) thermophilus and lactobacillus (lb.) delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. high loads of other lactic acid bacteria species, including lb. helveticus, lb. paracasei and leuconostoc (leuc.) lactis were found to occur as well. a selected autochthonous multiple strain culture (amsc) composed of one lb. bulgaricus, one lb. paracasei and one s. thermophilus strain, applied for the pilot-scale production of traditional matsoni, resulted the best in terms of enhanced shelf-life (one month), sensorial and nutritional quality without altering its overall typical quality. this amsc is at disposal of smes who need to exploit and standardize the overall quality of this traditional fermented milk, preserving its typicality.

TI  == diversity of thermophilic bacteria in raw, pasteurized and selectively-cultured milk, as assessed by culturing, pcr-dgge and pyrosequencing.
AB  == thermophilic lactic acid bacteria (lab) species, such as streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii and lactobacillus helveticus, enjoy worldwide economic importance as dairy starters. to assess the diversity of thermophilic bacteria in milk, milk samples were enriched in thermophilic organisms through a stepwise procedure which included pasteurization of milk at 63 degrees c for 30 min (pm samples) and pasteurization followed by incubation at 42 degrees c for 24 h (ipm samples). the microbial composition of these samples was analyzed by culture-dependent (at 42 degrees c) and culture-independent (pcr-dgge and pyrosequencing of 16s rrna gene amplicons) microbial techniques. the results were then compared to those obtained for their corresponding starting raw milk counterparts (rm samples). twenty different species were scored by culturing among 352 isolates purified from the counting plates and identified by  molecular methods. mesophilic lab species (lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garvieae) were dominant (87% of the isolates) among the rm samples. however, s. thermophilus and lb. delbrueckii were found to be the dominant recoverable organisms in both pm and ipm samples. the dgge profiles of rm and pm samples were found to be very similar; the most prominent bands belonging to lactococcus, leuconostoc and streptococcus species. in contrast, just three dgge bands were obtained for ipm samples, two of which were assigned to s. thermophilus. the pyrosequencing results scored 95 operational taxonomic units (otus) at 3% sequence divergence in an rm sample, while only 13 were encountered in two ipm samples. this technique identified leuconostoc citreum as the dominant microorganism in the rm sample, while s. thermophilus constituted more than 98% of the reads in the ipm samples. the procedure followed in this study allowed to  estimate the bacterial diversity in milk and afford a suitable strategy for the isolation of new thermophilic lab strains, among which adequate starters might be selected.

TI  == development of a multiplex real time pcr to detect thermophilic lactic acid bacteria in natural whey starters.
AB  == a multiplex real time pcr (mrealt-pcr) useful to rapidly screen microbial composition of thermophilic starter cultures for hard cooked cheeses and to compare samples with potentially different technological properties was developed. novel primers directed toward phes gene were designed and optimized for multiple detection of lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus fermentum. the assay was based on sybr green chemistry followed by melting curves analysis. the method was then evaluated for applications in the specific detection of the 4 lactic acid bacteria (lab) in 29 different natural whey starters for parmigiano reggiano cheese production. the results obtained by mrealt-pcr were also compared with those obtained on the same samples by fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) and length-heterogeneity pcr (lh-pcr). the mrealt-pcr developed in this study, was found to be effective for analyzing species present in the samples with an average sensitivity down to less than 600 copies of dna and therefore sensitive enough to detect even minor lab community members of thermophilic starter cultures. the assay was able to describe the microbial population of all the different natural whey starter samples analyzed, despite their natural variability. a higher number of whey starter samples with s. thermophilus and l.  fermentum present in their microbial community were revealed, suggesting that these species could be more frequent in parmigiano reggiano natural whey starter  samples than previously shown. the method was more effective than lh-pcr and fish and, considering that these two techniques have to be used in combination to detect the less abundant species, the mrealt-pcr was also faster. providing a single step sensitive detection of l. helveticus, l. delbrueckii, s. thermophilus and l. fermentum, the developed mrealt-pcr could be used for screening thermophilic starter cultures and to follow the presence of those species during  ripening of derived dairy products. a major increase in understanding the starter culture contribution to cheese ecosystem could be harnessed to control cheese ripening and flavor formation.

TI  == isolation and identification of cultivable lactic acid bacteria in traditional yak milk products of gansu province in china.
AB  == various traditional fermented yak milk and raw milk foods could be considered as  an abundant resource for obtaining novel lactic acid bacteria (lab) with unique properties. eighty-eight samples of yak milk products were collected from gansu province in china. three hundred and nineteen strains of lab isolated from these  samples were identified by phenotypic methods, 16s rrna gene sequence analysis and pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) technology. among the  isolates, one hundred and sixty-four isolates (51.41% of the total) were classified under lactobacilli, and one hundred and fifty-five (48.59%) belonged to cocci. all the isolates were classified to six genera (lactobacillus, lactococcus, leuconostoc, streptococcus, enterococcus and weissella) and twenty-one species. lactobacillus helveticus (87 strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (49 strains), streptococcus thermophilus (39 strains), lactobacillus casei (31 strains) and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (19 strains) were considered as the predominant populations in the yak milk products. the results showed that there were abundant genus and species lab existing in yak milk products in gansu province in china. the obtained lab pure cultures may be a valuable source for further starter selection.

TI  == a survey of the bacterial composition of kurut from tibet using a culture-independent approach.
AB  == kurut (fermented yak milk) made by natural fermentation is a very important dairy food for the local people in tibet (china). it is important to fully understand the bacterial composition of kurut for quality improvement and industrial production. because more than 99% of prokaryotes cannot be cultured and identified by methods currently used in taxonomy, we applied a culture-independent approach to explore the microbial biodiversity of this traditional food. in this study, a bacterial 16s rrna gene clone library, including 460 clones, was constructed using total dna extracted from 30 samples of kurut. after screening by restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analysis, 56 operational taxonomic units (otu) with unique rflp patterns were obtained. then, 1 representative sequence of every otu was sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed. the representative phylotypes were affiliated with 5 groups, including lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, lactobacillus helveticus, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and acetobacter. in addition, nearly one-third of the representative clones (132 clones) had low similarity to species in genbank (<97%), and these phylotypes were regarded as unknown bacteria. the characteristics of kurut are determined not only by lactic acid bacteria well known by the culture-dependent approach but also by bacteria that have not yet been identified.

TI  == quantitative proteomic analysis of bacterial enzymes released in cheese during ripening.
AB  == due to increasingly available bacterial genomes in databases, proteomic tools have recently been used to screen proteins expressed by micro-organisms in food in order to better understand their metabolism in situ. while the main objective  is the systematic identification of proteins, the next step will be to bridge the gap between identification and quantification of these proteins. for that purpose, a new mass spectrometry-based approach was applied, using isobaric tagging reagent for quantitative proteomic analysis (itraq), which are amine specific and yield labelled peptides identical in mass. experimental swiss-type cheeses were manufactured from microfiltered milk using streptococcus thermophilus itg st20 and lactobacillus helveticus itg lh1 as lactic acid starters. at three ripening times (7, 20 and 69 days), cheese aqueous phases were extracted and enriched in bacterial proteins by fractionation. each sample, standardised in protein amount prior to proteomic analyses, was: i) analysed by 2d-electrophoresis for qualitative analysis and ii) submitted to trypsinolysis, and labelled with specific itraq tag, one per ripening time. the three labelled samples were mixed together and analysed by nano-lc coupled on-line with esi-qtof mass spectrometer. thirty proteins, both from bacterial or bovine origin, were identified and efficiently quantified. the free bacterial proteins detected were  enzymes from the central carbon metabolism as well as stress proteins. depending  on the protein considered, the quantity of these proteins in the cheese aqueous extract increased from 2.5 to 20 fold in concentration from day 7 to day 69 of ripening.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of different lactic acid bacteria strains.
AB  == five lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains belonging to species lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and streptococcus thermophilus were tested for their susceptibility to 27 antibiotics. the minimum  inhibitory concentrations of each antimicrobial were determined using a microdilution test. among the strains a high susceptibility was detected for most of the cell-wall synthesis inhibitors (penicillins, cefoxitin and vancomycin) and resistance toward inhibitors of dna synthesis (trimethoprim/sulfonamides and fluoroquinolones). generally, the lactobacillus strains were inhibited by antibiotics such as chloramphenicol, erythromycin and tetracycline at breakpoint  levels lower or equal to the levels defined by the european food safety authority. despite the very similar profile of s. thermophilus lc201 to lactobacilli, the detection of resistance toward erythromycin necessitates the performance of additional tests in order to prove the absence of transferable resistance genes.

TI  == reverse transcription quantitative pcr revealed persistency of thermophilic lactic acid bacteria metabolic activity until the end of the ripening of emmental cheese.
AB  == for emmental manufacture two kinds of adjunct culture are added: (i) thermophilic lactic acid bacteria (starters) such as lactobacillus helveticus (lh), and streptococcus thermophilus (st) growing the first day of the manufacture and (ii) ripening culture. st and lh have a key role in curd acidification and proteolysis at the beginning of the manufacture but are considered to be lyzed for a great part of them at the ripening step. the aim of this work was to assess the metabolic activity of these bacteria throughout manufacture and ripening. during  emmental cheesemaking, lh and st were subjected to i) population quantification by numerations and by quantitative pcr (qpcr) ii) reverse transcription (rt) temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (ttge) iii) transcript quantification by rt-qpcr targeting 16s rrna, tuf and grol mrnas to evaluate bacterial metabolic activity. during ripening, st and lh numerations showed a 2.5 log(10) loss of culturability whereas qpcr on pelleted cells revealed only one log(10) of decrease for both of these species. 10(9) st and 10(8) lh cells/g of cheese still remained. they contained a stable number of 16s transcript and at least 10(6) copies of mrnas per 10(9) cells until the end of ripening. these results prove the unexpected persistency of thermophilic lactic acid bacteria starters (st and  lh) metabolic activity until the end of ripening and open new perspectives in term of their involvement in the quality of cheeses during ripening.

AB  == the up- and downstream regions of ctl1 and ctl2 that encode a cystathionine lyase were analyzed in various lactobacillus casei strains. ctl1 and ctl2 were found to be part of a gene cluster encoding two other open reading frames. one of the two  open reading frames precedes ctl1 and encodes a putative cysteine synthase. the other open reading frame lies downstream of ctl1 and encodes a putative serine acetyltransferase. the gene cluster is not present in the publicly available genome sequences of l. casei atcc 334, bl23 and zhang. apparently, the gene cluster was acquired by a horizontal gene transfer event and can also be found in other lactic acid bacteria such as lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus. rt-pcr was used to  analyze the expression of the gene cluster. additionally, an mass spectrometry-based selected reaction monitoring method was developed for quantifying ctl1 in a cell-free extract of lactic acid bacteria. the gene cluster cysk2-ctl1-cyse2 was expressed as single transcript, and expression was down-regulated by cysteine. in addition, cystathionine lyase activity present in  cell-free extracts disappeared when l. casei was grown in the presence of cysteine. whereas the transcript and the gene product of ctl1 protein were found  in all studied ctl1(+)l. casei strains, only the transcript but not the protein or cystathionine lyase activity was detected in l. helveticus fam2888, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus atcc 11842 and s. thermophilus fam17014, which actually possess a homolog of the cysk2-ctl1-cyse2 gene cluster.

TI  == bioconversion of ovine scotta into lactic acid with pure and mixed cultures of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == scotta is the main by-product in the making of ricotta cheese. it is widely produced in southern europe and particularly in italy where it represents a serious environmental pollutant due to its high lactose content. with the aim of  evaluating whether scotta bioconversion into lactic acid can be considered as an  alternative to its disposal, besides providing it with an added value, here the growth, fermentative performances, and lactic acid productions of pure and mixed  cultures of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus were evaluated on ovine scotta-based media, without and with the addition of nutritional supplements. the outcomes indicate that ovine scotta can  be utilized for the biotechnological production of lactic acid with yields up to  92%, comparable to those obtained on cheese-whey. indeed, the addition of nutritional supplements generally improves the fermentative performances of lactic acid bacteria leading to about 2 g l(-1) h(-1) of lactic acid. moreover, the use of mixed cultures for scotta bioconversion reduces the need for nutritional supplements, with no detrimental effects on the productive parameters compared to pure cultures. finally, by using l. casei and s. thermophilus in pure and mixed cultures, up to 99% optically pure l: -lactic acid can be obtained.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in mongolia.
AB  == spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. the objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in mongolia. the lab counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/ml. fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of lab, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. in total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de man, rogosa, and sharpe agar and m17 agar. each isolate was considered to be presumptive lab based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16s rrna gene sequencing,  multiplex pcr assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. all isolates from mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), enterococcus durans (3 strains), lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), lactobacillus casei (16 strains), lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and weissella cibaria (1 strain). the predominant lab were strep. thermophilus and lb. helveticus, which were isolated  from all sampling sites. the results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of mongolia have complex compositions of lab species. such diversity of lab provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.

AB  == a pentaplex pcr assay for the rapid, selective and simultaneous detection of lactobacillus helveticus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus, and l. fermentum, was developed. the target sequences were a group of genes coding for beta-galactosidase production (s. thermophilus and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), for cell-enveloped associated proteinase synthesis (l. helveticus), for dipeptide transport system production (l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis) and for arginine-ornithine antiporter protein production (l. fermentum). the analytical specificity of the assay was evaluated with 5 reference strains and 140 lactic acid bacterial strains derived  from raw milk cheeses and belonging to the lactobacillus, streptococcus, lactococcus and enterococcus genera. the identification limit for each target strain was 10(3)cfu/ml. this new molecular assay was used to investigate the lab  population by direct extraction of dna from the 12 whey cultures for grana padano. the pentaplex pcr assay revealed a good correspondence with microbiological analyses and allowed to identify even minor lab community members which, can be out-competed in vitro by numerically more abundant microbial species.

TI  == microbial diversity, dynamics and activity throughout manufacturing and ripening  of castelmagno pdo cheese.
AB  == the diversity, dynamics and activity of castelmagno pdo cheese microbiota were studied in three batches produced in a floor valley farm, in the grana valley (northwest italy), during the wintertime. samples of milk, curd and cheese (core  and subsurface) at different ripening time were submitted to both culture-dependent and -independent analysis. in particular, dna and rna directly  extracted from the matrices were studied by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and reverse transcription (rt)-pcr-dgge. culture-dependent methods highlighted the initial dominance of a thermophilic streptococcal population with the species streptococcus thermophilus and s. agalactiae. then, mesophilic lactococci occurred among isolates during manufacturing, with lactococcus lactis which was also well represented in the first month of castelmagno pdo ripening. at this point and throughout the ripening, lactobacilli prevailed in cheese samples, represented from lactobacillus plantarum and lb. casei. culture-independent analysis underlined the undoubted role of l. lactis, actively involved in both castelmagno pdo manufacturing and ripening. despite lb. helveticus was never isolated on selective media, a dgge band referred to this microorganism was detected, at rna level, in samples from ripened cheeses. on the other hand, lb. plantarum was widely isolated from the plates, among lactobacilli, but never detected by direct analysis. due to the importance of microbiota in the sensory richness and properties of traditional cheeses, new information have been added, in this work, on microbial diversity of castelmagno  pdo cheese.

TI  == effect of fermentation by pure and mixed cultures of streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus helveticus on isoflavone and b-vitamin content of a fermented soy beverage.
AB  == enhancement of nutritional or vitamin content of foods is commonly touted as a major benefit of probiotics. in this paper, we examined the ability of three probiotic bacteria either alone or in combination to enhance nutritional content. pure and mixed cultures of streptococcus thermophilus st5 and lactobacillus helveticus r0052 or bifidobacterium longum r0175 were used to prepare fermented soy beverages. the effects of strain, acidification and mixed cultures on the deconjugation of soy isoflavones were examined. acidification to ph 4.7 alone resulted in a 7% drop in isoflavone levels. deconjugation levels varied between the different glucosides. fermentation by l. helveticus r0052 resulted in the 50% reduction in total glucosides with o-malonyl glucosides being reduced 64%. fermentation by s. thermophilus st5 or b. longum r0175 had no significant effect  on isoflavone levels. combining a s. thermophilus strain with a l. helveticus culture reduced the effectiveness of the latter. fermentation did not significantly modify vitamin b1 or b6 levels.

TI  == specific metabolic activity of ripening bacteria quantified by real-time reverse  transcription pcr throughout emmental cheese manufacture.
AB  == bacterial communities of fermented foods are usually investigated by culture-dependent methods. real-time quantitative pcr (qpcr) and reverse transcription (rt)-qpcr offer new possibilities to quantify the populations present and their metabolic activity. the aim of this work was to develop qpcr and rt-qpcr methods to assess the metabolic activity and the stress level of the  two species used as ripening cultures in emmental cheese manufacture, propionibacterium freudenreichii and lactobacillus paracasei. three small scale (1/100) microbiologically controlled emmental cheeses batches were manufactured and inoculated with lactobacillus helveticus, streptococcus thermophilus, p. freudenreichii and l. paracasei. at 12 steps of cheese manufacture and ripening,  the populations of p. freudenreichii and l. paracasei were quantified by numerations on agar media and by qpcr. 16s, tuf and grol transcript levels were quantified by rt-qpcr. sampling was carried out in triplicate. qpcr and rt-qpcr assessments were specific, efficient and linear. the quantification limit was 10(3) copies of cells or cdna/g of cheese. cell quantifications obtained by qpcr  gave similar results than plate count for p. freudenreichii growth and 0.5 to 1 log lower in the stationary phase. bacterial counts and qpcr quantifications showed that l. paracasei began to grow during the pressing step while p. freudenreichii began to grow from the beginning of ripening (in the cold room). tuf cdna quantification results suggested that metabolic activity of l. paracasei reached a maximum during the first part of the ripening (in cold room) and decreased progressively during ripening (in the warm room). metabolic activity of p. freudenreichii was maximum at the end of cold ripening room and was stable during the first two weeks in warm room. after lactate exhaustion (after two weeks of warm room), the number of tuf cdna decreased reflecting reduced metabolic activity. for l. paracasei, grol cdna were stable during ripening. for  p. freudenreichii, grol1 gene was highly-expressed during acidification, while grol2 gene highly expression was only observed at the end of the ripening stage after lactate (carbon substrate of p. freudenreichii) exhaustion. the potential use of 16s and tuf genes for the normalization of cdna quantification throughout  an emmental cheese manufacture is discussed. for the first time, specific gene expression was performed by rt-qpcr yielding metabolic activity and stress response evaluation for l. paracasei and p. freudenreichii in cheese.

TI  == effects of fermentation by lactic acid bacteria on the antigenicity of bovine whey proteins.
AB  == background: the main whey proteins alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-la) and beta-lactoglobulin (beta-lg) are considered as the major allergens in cow's milk. microbial fermentation can produce some proteolytic enzymes, which can induce the degradation of milk protein allergens. in this study, the effects of fermentation by lactic acid bacteria on the antigenicity of alpha-la and beta-lg were investigated using indirect competitive elisa. meanwhile, the proteolysis of milk proteins was detected by tnbs assay and sds-page electrophoresis. results: fermentation by lactic acid bacteria could significantly reduce the antigenicity  of alpha-la and beta-lg in skim milk. combined strains of lactobacillus helveticus and streptococcus thermophilus were the most effective in reducing the antigenicity of both whey proteins. in addition, alpha-la and beta-lg antigenicity decreased to a lower value at 6 h of fermentation and at 0.5 d of cold storage by fermentation with the combined strains. the results of tnbs assay and sds-page electrophoresis showed that lactic acid bacteria strains used in this study hydrolysed whey proteins only to a limited extent. conclusion: the fermentation with lactic acid bacteria is an effective way to reduce whey proteins antigenicity.

AB  == background: in this work the proteolysis profiles of argentinean sheep cheeses made by two different production methods were studied in order to develop products with typical and defined features. cheeses with a starter of streptococcus thermophilus, curd cut to corn grain size, washed and heated to 43  degrees c (s cheeses) and cheeses with a mixed starter of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus helveticus and lactobacillus bulgaricus, curd cut to  rice grain size, unwashed and heated to 47 degrees c (l cheeses) were manufactured. the cheeses were ripened at 12 degrees c and 80% relative humidity  for 180 days and samples were taken throughout this period. results: gross composition and primary proteolysis were similar for both types of cheeses. streptococci counts diminished from 10(9) to 10(7) colony-forming units g(-1) during ripening in both s and l cheeses. lactobacilli counts in l cheeses decreased during ripening and disappeared at 180 days. l cheeses had significantly lower ph values and showed higher peptidolysis than s cheeses. triangle sensory evaluation indicated important differences between the two types of cheeses. conclusion: s cheeses had a low proteolysis level and a soft flavour, making them appropriate for consumption after a short ripening time. l cheeses had a higher proteolysis level and more intense sensory characteristics, making them appropriate for consumption after a longer ripening time.

TI  == characterization of a novel lysm domain from lactobacillus fermentum bacteriophage endolysin and its use as an anchor to display heterologous proteins on the surfaces of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the endolysin lyb5, from lactobacillus fermentum temperate bacteriophage phipyb5, showed a broad lytic spectrum against gram-positive as well as gram-negative bacteria. sequence analysis revealed that the c terminus of the endolysin lyb5 (ly5c) contained three putative lysin motif (lysm) repeat regions, implying that  ly5c was involved in bacterial cell wall binding. to investigate the potential of ly5c for surface display, green fluorescent protein (gfp) was fused to ly5c at its n or c terminus and the resulting fusion proteins were expressed in escherichia coli. after being mixed with various cells in vitro, gfp was successfully displayed on the surfaces of lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus casei, lb. brevis, lb. plantarum, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, lb. helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus cells. increases in the fluorescence intensities of chemically pretreated l. lactis and lb. casei cells compared to those of nonpretreated cells suggested that the peptidoglycan was the binding ligand for ly5c. moreover, the ph and concentration of sodium chloride were optimized to enhance the binding capacity of gfp-ly5c, and high-intensity fluorescence of cells was observed under optimal conditions. all results suggested that ly5c was  a novel anchor for constructing a surface display system for lactic acid bacteria (lab). to demonstrate the applicability of the ly5c-mediated surface display system, beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) from paenibacillus sp. strain k1, replacing gfp, was functionally displayed on the surfaces of lab cells via ly5c. the success in surface display of gfp and beta-gal opened up the feasibility of employing the cell wall anchor of bacteriophage endolysin for surface display in  lab.

AB  == fermented soy and dairy milk preparations provide a means for delivering lactic acid bacteria and their fermentation products into the diet. our aims were to test immunomodulatory bioactivity of fermented soy beverage (sb) and dairy milk blend (mb) preparations on human intestinal epithelial cells (iec) and to determine the impact of freezing medium on culture survival prior to bioactivity  analyses. fermented sb and mb were prepared using pure or mixed cultures of streptococcus thermophilus st5, bifidobacterium longum r0175, and lactobacillus helveticus r0052. immunomodulatory bioactivity was assessed by testing selected sb and mb ferments on tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnfalpha)-treated iec and measuring effects on interleukin-8 (il-8) production. impact of timing of ferment administration relative to this pro-inflammatory challenge was investigated. the  most pronounced reductions in iec il-8 production were observed when iec were treated with either sb or mb ferment preparations prior to tnfalpha challenge. these results indicate that freezing-stable mb and sb ferments prepared with selected strains can modulate iec il-8 production in vitro, and suggest that yogurt-like fermented soy formulations could provide a functional food alternative to milk-based fermented products.

TI  == identification and characterization of a strain-dependent cystathionine beta/gamma-lyase in lactobacillus casei potentially involved in cysteine biosynthesis.
AB  == the trans-sulfuration pathways allow the interconversion of cysteine and methionine with the intermediary formation of cystathionine and homocysteine. the genome database of lactobacillus casei atcc 334 provides evidence that this species cannot synthesize cysteine from methionine via the trans-sulfuration pathway. however, several l. casei strains use methionine as the sole sulfur source, which implies that these strains can convert methionine to cysteine. cystathionine synthases and lyases play a crucial role in the trans-sulfuration pathway. by applying proteomic techniques, we have identified a protein in cell-free extracts of l. casei, which showed high homology to a gene product encoded in the genome of lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus helveticus but not in the genome of l. casei atcc  334. the presence of the gene was only found in strains able to grow on methionine as the sole sulfur source. moreover, two gene variants were identified. both gene variants were cloned and expressed heterologously in escherichia coli. the recombinant enzymes exhibited cystathionine lyase activity  in vitro and also cleaved cysteine, homocysteine and methionine releasing volatile sulfur compounds.

TI  == in silico prediction of horizontal gene transfer events in lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus reveals protocooperation in yogurt manufacturing.
AB  == lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus, used in yogurt starter cultures, are well known for their stability and protocooperation during their coexistence in milk. in this study, we show that a close interaction between the  two species also takes place at the genetic level. we performed an in silico analysis, combining gene composition and gene transfer mechanism-associated features, and predicted horizontally transferred genes in both l. bulgaricus and  s. thermophilus. putative horizontal gene transfer (hgt) events that have occurred between the two bacterial species include the transfer of exopolysaccharide (eps) biosynthesis genes, transferred from s. thermophilus to l. bulgaricus, and the gene cluster cbs-cblb(cglb)-cyse for the metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids, transferred from l. bulgaricus or lactobacillus helveticus to s. thermophilus. the hgt event for the cbs-cblb(cglb)-cyse gene cluster was analyzed in detail, with respect to both evolutionary and functional  aspects. it can be concluded that during the coexistence of both yogurt starter species in a milk environment, agonistic coevolution at the genetic level has probably been involved in the optimization of their combined growth and interactions.

TI  == multiple interactions between streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus helveticus and lactobacillus delbrueckii strongly affect their growth kinetics during the making of hard cooked cheeses.
AB  == in hard cooked cheeses, any interactions between the thermophilic starters as they grow during the cheese-making are critical, since they modify bacterial growth kinetics and acidification kinetics, so affecting the ripening process and the final characteristics of the cheese. twenty-four experimental hard cooked cheeses were made under controlled conditions, the milk being inoculated with various combinations of thermophilic strains of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus helveticus and lactobacillus delbrueckii. over the first day of manufacturing we recorded a wide range of different growth kinetics for each starter species used, and a wide range of ph kinetics, depending on the starter combination. most of the bacterial variability could be statistically explained by the nature, quantity, and/or presence or absence of the different strains inoculated. four main interactions between the three species were evidenced during cheese-making. there was antagonism between l. helveticus and l. delbrueckii. the lactobacilli had a positive effect on s. thermophilus, which was reciprocal for l. helveticus. l. helveticus had a negative effect on s. thermophilus cultivability. and the combination of s. thermophilus inoculated in  large quantities and l. helveticus strain h2 had a negative effect on the growth  of the l. delbrueckii strain d2. while the positive effect of l. delbrueckii on s. thermophilus probably corresponds to interactions in milk that have already been described and published, the other interactions were hitherto unknown. these interactions are of major importance for the growth kinetics of streptococci and  thermophilic lactobacilli during cheese-making.

TI  == grana padano cheese whey starters: microbial composition and strain distribution.
AB  == the aim of this work was to evaluate the species composition and the genotypic strain heterogeneity of dominant lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from whey starter cultures used to manufacture grana padano cheese. twenty-four grana padano cheese whey starters collected from dairies located over a wide geographic production area in the north of italy were analyzed. total thermophilic lab streptococci and lactobacilli were quantified by agar plate counting. population  structure of the dominant and metabolically active lab species present in the starters was profiled by reverse transcriptase, length heterogeneity-pcr (rt-lh-pcr), a culture-independent technique successfully applied to study whey starter ecosystems. the dominant bacterial species were lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, and lactobacillus fermentum. diversity in the species composition allowed the whey cultures to be grouped into four main typologies, the one containing l. helveticus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, and s. thermophilus being the most frequent one (45% of the cultures analyzed), followed by that containing only the two lactobacilli (40%). only a minor fraction of the cultures contained l. helveticus alone (4%) or all the four lab species (11%). five hundred and twelve  strains were isolated from the 24 cultures and identified by m13-pcr fingerprinting coupled with 16s rrna gene sequencing. most of the strains were l. helveticus (190 strains; 37% of the total), l delbrueckii subsp. lactis (90 strains; 18%) and s. thermophilus (215 strains; 42%). this result was in good agreement with the qualitative whey starter composition observed by rt-lh-pcr. m13-pcr fingerprinting indicated a markedly low infra-species diversity, i.e. the same biotypes were often found in more than one culture. the distribution of the  biotypes into the different cultures was mainly dairy plant-specific rather than  correlated with the different production areas.

TI  == molecular methods for identification of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus using methionine biosynthesis and 16s rrna genes.
AB  == yoghurt and starter culture producers are still searching strains of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus to produce healthier yogurt with longer shelf life, better texture, taste and quality. however, selective identification of lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and strep. thermophilus from a mixed population using microbiological and biochemical methods is difficult, time consuming and may not be accurate. in this study, a quick, sensitive and accurate method is proposed to identify both lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and strep. thermophilus using pcr. the method is comprised of two parts. in the first part, methionine biosynthesis genes, known to be present in both species were partially amplified by designed primers (cysmet2f and cysmet2r). partial amplification of the methionine biosynthesis gene which gives 700 bp fragment resulted in selective identification of lb. bulgaricus and strep. thermophilus. all 16 lb. bulgaricus and 6 strep. thermophilus isolates assessed by this method gave the expected amplification. on the other hand, further analysis of other closely related species with the same primers have indicated that the same product was also amplified in two more lactobacilli namely, lb. delbrueckii subsp. lactis and lb. helveticus species. thus, in the second part of the method, further differentiation of lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and strep. thermophilus from each other and these species was achieved using restriction analysis of 16s rrna gene with ecori.

TI  == microbial diversity in natural whey cultures used for the production of caciocavallo silano pdo cheese.
AB  == the microbial diversity of sixty-three natural whey cultures (nwcs) for the manufacture of caciocavallo silano cheese pdo was studied. the nwcs were collected from different dairies covering the whole territory of pdo production including five different regions of southern italy. the microbial species diversity was determined by direct dna extraction from nwcs and polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) amplification of variable regions of the 16s rrna gene followed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (dhplc). dgge and dhplc fingerprinting yielded the same results in terms of number of bands/peaks and specific migration/retention time of the amplicons. the dhplc technique was used in this study for the first time to assess a food-related mixed microbial community by a culture-independent approach and proved to be at least as effective as dgge in profiling species diversity in nwcs. cluster analysis of dgge and dhplc data revealed that the species-related groups of similarity were not dependent on the geographical origin of the nwcs. the presence of three groups of 10-14 nwcs at 100% of species similarity indicated that some species associations are very commonly occurring in the nwcs for caciocavallo silano cheese pdo. a rapd-pcr analysis of the nwcs was also performed for the members of the above groups and it showed that, though characterized by the same species diversity, most of the identical nwcs included  different biotypes. the sequences of dgge bands and dhplc peaks revealed the occurrence of mainly thermophilic lactic acid bacteria such as lactobacillus delbrueckii, l. helveticus and streptococcus thermophilus even though the mesophilic lactococcus lactis also occurred in some nwcs. in conclusion, the results of this study indicate that the microbial diversity of nwcs used for the  caciocavallo silano pdo cheese is not high, it is not dependent on the geographical origin and the same microbial species occur within the territory examined. the microbiota of fermented pdo products and its possible link with territory should be studied case by case in order to have useful evidences for the assessment of product quality and authenticity.

TI  == whey starter for grana padano cheese: effect of technological parameters on viability and composition of the microbial community.
AB  == this work aimed to investigate the effects of thermal treatments and yeast extract addition on the composition of the microbial community of natural whey starters for grana padano cheese. different natural whey starter samples were held at 4 degrees c for 24 h (cooling treatment), or at -20 degrees c for 24 h (freezing treatment) to evaluate the possibility of conservation, or at 54 degrees c for 1 h (heat treatment) to evaluate the effect of the temperature commonly used during curd cooking. separately, another set of samples was enriched with 0.3, 0.5, and 1.0% (wt/vol) of yeast extract to study its effect on the growth of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in the starter. the new approach in this study is the use of 2 culture-independent methods: length heterogeneity (lh)-reverse transcription (rt)-pcr and fluorescence microscopy. these techniques allowed us to easily, quickly, and reproducibly assess metabolically active lab in the control and treated samples. the lh-rt-pcr technique distinguished microorganisms based on natural variations in the length of 16s rrna amplified by rt-pcr, as analyzed by using an automatic gene sequencer. fluorescence microscopy counts were performed by using a live/dead baclight bacterial viability kit. the  repeatability of lh-rt-pcr showed that this technique has great potential to reveal changes in the microbial community of natural whey starters for grana padano cheese. all species showed low sensitivity to cold (4 degrees c). however, after the freezing (-20 degrees c) and heating (54 degrees c) treatments, different behaviors of the species were reported, with significant changes in their viability and relative composition. heating treatment during curd cooking profoundly affected the viability and composition of the community that remained  in the cheese and that consequently modified the microbial population. at the same time, this treatment produced the selection of lab in whey and could be considered as the first step in natural whey starter production. addition of yeast extract stimulated the growth of streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. lactis to the detriment of lactobacillus helveticus species. because the yeast extract altered the microflora balance, whey starter conservation at -20 degrees c and yeast extract addition cannot be suggested as technological innovations.

TI  == redox potential to discriminate among species of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == aims: to verify to what degree reducing capacity is a characterizing parameter of a species, and of the strains themselves within a given species, of lactic acid bacteria. methods and results: eighty-eight strains belonging to 10 species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from traditional italian cheeses were studied for their reduction activity: enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis,  lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus helveticus and pediococcus pentosaceus. it was observed that the lactococci reached minimum redox potential  before the lactobacilli. the reduction rate of enterococcus spp. and l. lactis ssp. lactis was higher than that of the streptococci and lactobacillus spp. all the p. pentosaceus strains had poor reduction activity compared with the other species. conclusions: the evolution of the redox potential in milk over a time span of 24 h has been found to be a parameter that characterizes a species: the different courses corresponding to the species in question are clearly evident, and interesting differences can also be noted within the same species. significance and impact of the study: the reduction aptitude of strains might be  used to select and adapt appropriate strains for use as starters for dairy products.

TI  == rapid restoration of colonic goblet cells induced by a hydrolyzed diet containing probiotics in experimental malnutrition.
AB  == purpose: to investigate the effects of the addition of probiotic bacteria to a hydrolyzed diet on the recovery of goblet cells during renutrition in an animal model of malnutrition. methods: twenty-six male wistar rats (200-250g) were included in the study. six were kept under normal conditions (sham group) while twenty received an aproteic diet for 15 days, and were randomized thereafter to receive a hydrolyzed diet containing (n=6; probiotic group) or not (n=6; hydrolyzed group) probiotics (10(6) cfu/g of streptococcus thermophilus e lactobacillus helveticus); or immediately killed (n=8; aproteic group). histological slides containing cecal and sigmoid biopsies were used to counting the number of goblet cells and the goblet cells/colonocytes ratio. results: malnutrition diminished the population of goblet cells in all sites. goblet cells/colonocytes ratio of the probiotic group was significantly greater than hydrolyzed group at the ceccum (0.39 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.34 +/-0.02; p=0.02). only rats fed with probiotics showed complete restoration of the normal goblet cells/colonocytes ratio at the sigmoid (0.37 +/- 0,02 vs. 0.22 +/- 0,03; p<0,001). conclusion: streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus helveticus added to a renutrition diet enhance the recovery of mucosal atrophy induced by malnutrition and especially induce a rapid restoration of goblet cells population in the malnourished colonic mucosa.

TI  == amino acid profiles of lactic acid bacteria, isolated from kefir grains and kefir starter made from them.
AB  == the characteristics of cell growth, lactic acid production, amino acid release and consumption by single-strain cultures of lactic acid bacteria (isolated from  kefir grains), and by a multiple-strain kefir starter prepared from them, were studied. the change in the levels of free amino acids was followed throughout the kefir process: single-strain kefir bacteria and the kefir starter (lactococcus lactis c15-1%+lactobacillus helveticus mp12-3%+(streptococcus thermophilus t15+lactobacillus bulgaricus hp1 = 1:1)-3%) were cultivated in pasteurized (92 degrees c for 20 min) cow's milk (3% fat content) at 28 degrees c for 5 h (the kefir starter reached ph 4.7) and subsequently grown at 20 degrees c for 16 h; storage was at 4 degrees c for 168 h. the strain l. helveticus mp12 was unrivaled with respect to free amino acid production (53.38 mg (100 g)(-1)) and cell growth (17.8 x 10(8) cfu ml(-1)); however, it manifested the lowest acidification activity. l. bulgaricus hp1 released approximately 3.7 times less amino acids, nearly 5 times lower cell growth, and produced about 1.2 times more lactic acid.  s. thermophilus t15 demonstrated dramatically complex amino acid necessities for  growth and metabolism. with l. lactis c15, the highest levels of growth and lactic acid synthesis were recorded (18.3 x 10(8) cfu ml(-1) and 7.8 g l(-1) lactic acid at the 21st hour), and as for free amino acid production, it approximated l. bulgaricus hp1 (17.03 mg (100 g)(-1) maximum concentration). in the l. lactis c15 culture, the amino acids were used more actively throughout the first exponential growth phase (by the 10th hour) than during the second growth phase. the unique properties of the l. helveticus mp12 strain to produce amino acids were employed to create a symbiotic bioconsortium kefir culture, which, under conditions of kefir formation, enhanced lactic acid production and shortened the time required to reach ph 4.7; intensified cell growth activity, resulting in a respective 90- and 60-fold increase in the concentration of lactobacilli and cocci in the mixed culture compared to individual cultures; and  accumulated free amino acids in the final kefir with higher total concentrations  (56.88 mg (100 g)(-1)) and an individual concentration of essential amino acids (1.5 times) greater than that of yogurt.

TI  == effects of yeasts and bacteria on the levels of folates in rye sourdoughs.
AB  == fermentation of rye dough is often accompanied with an increase in folate content. in this study, three sourdough yeasts, candida milleri cbs 8195, saccharomyces cerevisiae ts 146, and torulaspora delbrueckii ts 207; a control, baker's yeast s. cerevisiae alko 743; and four lactobacillus spp., l. acidophilus tsb 262, l. brevis tsb 307, l. plantarum tsb 304, and l. sanfranciscensis tsb 299 originally isolated from rye sourdough were examined for their abilities to produce or consume folates. the microorganisms were grown in yeast extract-peptone-d-glucose medium as well as in small-scale fermentations that modelled the sourdough fermentation step used in rye baking. total folate contents were determined using lactobacillus rhamnosus (atcc 7469) as the growth  indicator organism. the microorganisms studied did not excrete folates into the media in significant amounts. yeasts increased the folate contents of sterilised  rye flour-water mixtures from 6.5 microg/100 g to between 15 and 23 microg/100 g  after 19-h fermentation, whereas lactic acid bacteria decreased it to between 2.9 and 4.2 microg/100 g. strains of lactobacillus bulgaricus, l. casei, l. curvatus, l. fermentum, l. helveticus, pediococcus spp., and streptococcus thermophilus that were also tested gave folate contents after fermentation that varied between 2 and 10.4 microg/100 g. although the four lactobacillus spp. from sourdough consumed folates their effect on folate contents in co-cultivations was minimal.  it was concluded that the increase of folate content during fermentation was mainly due to folate synthesis by yeasts. fermentation of non-sterilised flour-water mixtures as such resulted in three-fold increases in the folate contents. two folate producing bacteria were isolated from the non-sterilised flour and identified as enterobacter cowanii and pantoea agglomerans.

AB  == about a thousand lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific pcr and rapd-pcr, respectively. rapd-pcr profiles, which were obtained by using the m13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by bionumerics software. cluster analysis of the combined rapd-pcr fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library,  which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. a library unit, in this case, can be considered  to be a definable taxon. the strains belonged to 11 main rapd-pcr fingerprinting  library units identified as lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus lactis. the possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. the proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful lab strain collection. the same approach could also be applied to identify lab strains isolated from other food ecosystems.

TI  == influence of starter culture ratios and warm room treatment on free fatty acid and amino acid in swiss cheese.
AB  == quantification of water-soluble volatile free fatty acids (ffa) and free amino acids (faa) was performed as a ripening index and an indirect measure of flavor development in swiss-type cheeses. the objective of this research was to assess the effect of warm room treatment (wrt) and usage ratio of starter cultures, streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus helveticus vs. propionibacteria, on  the concentration of ffa and faa in pilot plant-scale swiss cheese. a capillary gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector was used for the analysis of ffa in swiss cheese. free amino acids were analyzed by the cd-ninhydrin method. starter culture ratios did not affect development of faa during the cheese ripening. however, duration of wrt had an effect on the concentration of faa in the swiss cheese. free amino acids increased considerably during wrt. a continuous increase in faa was shown during 70-d ripening time after wrt. the concentrations of c2:0 and c3:0 fatty acids were affected by starter culture ratios after 2-wk wrt, but these differences had mostly disappeared after 3-wk wrt. similar concentrations of ffa and faa reported in previous studies were developed in swiss cheese with a 3-wk wrt and a 0.33:1 ratio of streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus helveticus to propionibacteria.

TI  == ability of thermophilic lactic acid bacteria to produce aroma compounds from amino acids.
AB  == although a large number of key odorants of swiss-type cheese result from amino acid catabolism, the amino acid catabolic pathways in the bacteria present in these cheeses are not well known. in this study, we compared the in vitro abilities of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lactobacillus helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus to produce aroma compounds from three amino acids, leucine, phenylalanine, and methionine, under mid-ph conditions of cheese ripening (ph 5.5), and we investigated the catabolic pathways used by these bacteria. in the three lactic acid bacterial species, amino acid catabolism was initiated by a transamination step, which requires the presence of an alpha-keto  acid such as alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-kg) as the amino group acceptor, and produced alpha-keto acids. only s. thermophilus exhibited glutamate dehydrogenase activity, which produces alpha-kg from glutamate, and consequently only s. thermophilus was capable of catabolizing amino acids in the reaction medium without alpha-kg addition. in the presence of alpha-kg, lactobacilli produced much more varied aroma compounds such as acids, aldehydes, and alcohols than s. thermophilus, which mainly produced alpha-keto acids and a small amount of hydroxy acids and acids. l. helveticus mainly produced acids from phenylalanine and leucine, while l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis produced larger amounts of alcohols and/or aldehydes. formation of aldehydes, alcohols, and acids from alpha-keto acids by l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis mainly results from the action of an alpha-keto acid decarboxylase, which produces aldehydes that are then oxidized or reduced to acids or alcohols. in contrast, the enzyme involved in the alpha-keto acid conversion to acids in l. helveticus and s. thermophilus is an alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase that produces acyl coenzymes a.

TI  == survey of bacterial proteins released in cheese: a proteomic approach.
AB  == during the ripening of emmental cheese, the bacterial ecosystem confers its organoleptic characteristics to the evolving curd both by the action of the living cells, and through the release of numerous proteins, including various types of enzymes into the cheese when the cells lyse. in emmental cheese these proteins can be released from thermophilic lactic acid bacteria used as starters  like lactobacillus helveticus, lb delbruecki subsp. lactis and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and ripening bacteria such as propionibacterium freudenreichii. the aim of this study was to obtain a proteomic view of the different groups of proteins within the cheese using proteomic tools to create a  reference map. a methodology was therefore developed to reduce the complexity of  cheese matrix prior to 2d-page analysis. the aqueous phase of cheese was prefractionated by size exclusion chromatography, bacterial and milk proteins were separated and subsequently characterised by mass spectrometry, prior to peptide mass fingerprint and sequence homology database search. five functional groups of proteins were identified involved in: (i) proteolysis, (ii) glycolysis, (iii) stress response, (iv) dna and rna repair and (v) oxidoreduction. the results revealed stress responses triggered by thermophilic lactic acid bacteria  and propionibacterium strains at the end of ripening. information was also obtained regarding the origin and nature of the peptidases released into the cheese, thus providing a greater understanding of casein degradation mechanisms during ripening. different peptidases arose from st thermophilus and lb helveticus, suggesting that streptococci are involved in peptide degradation in addition to the proteolytic activity of lactobacilli.

TI  == changes in galactose and lactic acid content of sweet whey during storage.
AB  == whey is often stored or transported for a period of time prior to processing. during this time period, galactose and lactic acid concentrations may accumulate, reducing the quality of spray-dried whey powders in regard to stickiness and agglomeration. this study surveyed industry samples of cheddar and mozzarella cheese whey streams to determine how galactose and lactic acid concentrations changed with storage at appropriate (4 degrees c) and abuse (37.8 degrees c) temperatures. samples stored at 4 degrees c did not exhibit significant increases in levels of lactic acid or galactose. mozzarella whey accumulated the greatest amount of galactose and lactic acid with storage at 37.8 degrees c. whey samples  derived from cheese made from single strains of starter culture were also evaluated to determine each culture's contribution to galactose and lactic acid production. starter cultures evaluated included streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris, and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. whey derived from l. helveticus accumulated a significantly greater amount of lactic acid upon storage at 37.8 degrees c as compared with the other cultures. galactose accumulation was significantly decreased in whey from l. lactis ssp. lactis stored at 37.8 degrees c in comparison with the other cultures. results from this study indicate that proper storage conditions (4 degrees c) for whey prevent accumulation of galactose and lactic acid while the extent of accumulation during storage at 37.8 degrees c varies depending on the culture(s)  used in cheese production.

TI  == growth and morphology of thermophilic dairy starters in alginate beads.
AB  == the aim of this research was to produce concentrated biomasses of thermophilic lactic starters using immobilized cell technology (ict). fermentations were carried out in milk using ph control with cells microentrapped in alginate beads. in the ict fermentations, beads represented 17% of the weight. some assays were carried out with free cells without ph control, in order to compare the ict populations with those of classical starters. with streptococcus thermophilus, overall populations in the fermentor were similar, but maximum bead population for (8.2 x 10(9) cfu/g beads) was 13 times higher than that obtained in a traditional starter (4.9 x 10(8) cfu/ml). for both lactobacillus helveticus strains studied, immobilized-cell populations were about 3 x 10(9) cfu/g beads. production of immobilized lb. bulgaricus 210r strain was not possible, since no increases in viable counts occurred in beads. therefore, production of concentrated cell suspension in alginate beads was more effective for s. thermophilus. photomicrographs of cells in alginate beads demonstrated that, while the morphology of s. thermophilus remained unchanged during the ict fermentation, immobilized cells of lb. helveticus appeared wider. in addition, cells of lb. bulgaricus were curved and elongated. these morphological changes would also impair the growth of immobilized lactobacilli.

AB  == pyroglutamic acid is present in high amounts (0.5g/ 100g) in many cheese varieties-and particularly in extensively ripened italian cheeses such as grana padano and parmigiano reggiano. an in vivo model system for cooked mini-cheese production and ripening acceleration was set up to demonstrate the ability of thermophilic lactic acid bacteria, used as a starter, to produce pyroglutamic acid (pglu). in mini-cheeses stored at 38 and 30 degrees c for up to 45 d, all starters tested produced different amounts of pglu. in descending order of pglu production, the bacteria analyzed were: lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus, and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis. evidence for the presence of glutamine to pglu cyclase activity in lactic acid bacteria was provided. cell lysates obtained from cultures of l. helveticus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, and s. thermophilus showed the ability to cyclize glutamine to pglu, resulting in processing yields from 1.4 to 30.3%, depending on the subspecies. formation of pglu from free glutamine appeared to be similar to that  observed using a glutamine-glutamine dipeptide substrate. under the experimental  conditions applied, pglu aminopeptidase activity was only detected in l. helveticus. thus, pglu formation in long-ripened cooked cheese may depend on the  activity of thermophilic lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == genetic diversity in swiss cheese starter cultures assessed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis and arbitrarily primed pcr.
AB  == aims: to assess intraspecific genetic heterogeneity among commercial swiss cheese starter culture strains of lactobacillus helveticus, streptococcus thermophilus and propionibacterium freudenreichii and to compare the efficacy of two genetic typing methods. methods and results: two genetic typing methods, pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and arbitrarily primed pcr (ap-pcr), were used. nine strep. thermophilus strains revealed eight pfge and five ap-pcr genotypes. seventeen lactobacillus strains yielded 16 and five genotypes by pfge and ap-pcr, respectively. eleven propionibacterium strains yielded 10 pfge genotypes. cluster analysis of pfge profiles generated similarity coefficients for strep. thermophilus, lact. helveticus and prop. freudenreichii strains of 29.5%, 60.3%,  and 30.5%, respectively. milk acidification rates for strep. thermophilus and lact. helveticus were determined. conclusions: pulsed field gel electrophoresis is more discriminatory than ap-pcr. the lact. helveticus group is more homogeneous than the other species examined. strains with > 87% similarity by pfge consistently had the same acidification rate and ap-pcr profile. significance and impact of the study: bacterial strains sold for swiss cheese manufacture in the united states are genetically diverse. clustering of genetically related bacteria may be useful in identifying new strains with industrially relevant traits.

TI  == autolytic phenotype of lactococcus lactis strains isolated from traditional tunisian dairy products.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the autolytic properties of lactococcus lactis strains isolated from artisan tunisian dairy products, their peptidoglycan hydrolase content and their activity spectrum. methods and results: the autolytic phenotype of lactococcus strains was evaluated under starvation conditions in potassium phosphate buffer. the results obtained highlighted a high degree of diversity among the strains analysed, allowing the identification of high and low autolytic lactococcus lactis strains. peptidoglycan hydrolase content was evaluated by renaturing sds-page using cells of micrococcus lysodeikticus as a target for the  enzymatic activity. a major activity band migrating at about 45 kda was observed. the lytic activity, evaluated in the presence of different chemicals, was retained in 8% nacl, 15 mmol l(-1) cacl2, and in a ph range between 5 and 9.5. the substrate specificity of peptidoglycan hydrolase from lactococcus strains was evaluated in renaturing sds-page incorporating cells of different bacterial species. the major autolysin of lactococcus lactis was active against cells of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus helveticus and listeria monocytogenes. conclusions: autolytic activity is widely distributed in lactococcus lactis and the rate of autolysis is strain-dependent. the major peptidoglycan hydrolase showed a wide spectrum of activity against several lactic acid bacteria and bacterial species involved in food-related infection. significance and impact of the study: the autolytic phenotype of lactococcus lactis strains isolated from tunisian artisan dairy products has been determined, and the data obtained should allow the selection of strains of technological interest in the cheese-ripening process.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in kefir grains and kefir made from them.
AB  == in an investigation of the changes in the microflora along the pathway: kefir grains (a)-->kefir made from kefir grains (b)-->kefir made from kefir as inoculum (c), the following species of lactic acid bacteria (83-90%) of the microbial count in the grains) were identified: lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus casei subsp. pseudoplantarum and lactobacillus brevis. yeasts (10-17%) identified were kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, saccharomyces cerevisiae, candida inconspicua and candida maris. in  the microbial population of kefir grains and kefir made from them the homofermentative lactic streptococci (52-65% and 79-86%, respectively) predominated. within the group of lactobacilli, the homofermentative thermophilic species l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and l. helveticus (70-87% of the isolated bacilli) predominated. along the pathway a-->b-->c, the streptococcal proportion in the total kefir microflora increased by 26-30% whereas the lactobacilli decreased by 13-23%. k. marxianus var. lactis was permanently present in kefir grains and kefirs, whereas the dominant lactose-negative yeast in the total yeast flora of the kefir grains dramatically decreased in kefir c.

TI  == characterization by molecular cloning and sequencing of the gene encoding an aminopeptidase from listeria monocytogenes.
AB  == the pepc gene of listeria monocytogenes encodes aminopeptidase c that is predicted to share 72% amino acid sequence similarity and 53% sequence identity with the cysteine aminopeptidase pepc from lactococcus lactis. the gene product also shows strong similarity to aminopeptidase c from streptococcus thermophilus  and lactobacillus helveticus, and to a cysteine proteinase/bleomycin hydrolase from saccharomyces cerevisiae. the enzyme from l. monocytogenes displayed broad n-terminal hydrolytic activity, with a similar substrate specificity to its lactic acid bacterial counterpart. the inhibition spectrum shows a great deal of  similarity with enzymes from the family of lactic acid bacteria. in addition, one of the clones studied contained dna sequences that could encode a regulatory protein of the deor helix-turn-helix dna binding protein family. the organization of the locus, designated pep, is presented along with the characterization of the gene products of the pep locus.

TI  == hydrolysis of sequenced beta-casein peptides provides new insight into peptidase  activity from thermophilic lactic acid bacteria and highlights intrinsic resistance of phosphopeptides.
AB  == the peptidases of thermophilic lactic acid bacteria have a key role in the proteolysis of swiss cheeses during warm room ripening. to compare their peptidase activities toward a dairy substrate, a tryptic/chymotryptic hydrolysate of purified beta-casein was used. thirty-four peptides from 3 to 35 amino acids,  including three phosphorylated peptides, constitute the beta-casein hydrolysate,  as shown by tandem mass spectrometry. cell extracts prepared from lactobacillus helveticus itg lh1, itg lh77, and cnrz 32, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis itg ll14 and itg ll51, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus cnrz 397 and ncdo  1489, and streptococcus thermophilus cnrz 385, cip 102303, and ta 060 were standardized in protein. the peptidase activities were assessed with the beta-casein hydrolysate as the substrate at ph 5.5 and 24 degrees c (conditions of warm room ripening) by (i) free amino acid release, (ii) reverse-phase chromatography, and (iii) identification of undigested peptides by mass spectrometry. regardless of strain, l. helveticus was the most efficient in hydrolyzing beta-casein peptides. interestingly, cell extracts of s. thermophilus were not able to release a significant level of free proline from the beta-casein hydrolysate, which was consistent with the identification of numerous dipeptides  containing proline. with the three lactic acid bacteria tested, the phosphorylated peptides remained undigested or weakly hydrolyzed indicating their high intrinsic resistance to peptidase activities. finally, several sets of peptides differing by a single amino acid in a c-terminal position revealed the presence of at least one carboxypeptidase in the cell extracts of these species.

TI  == biodegradability of food-associated extracellular polysaccharides.
AB  == exopolysaccharides (epss) produced by lactic acid bacteria, which are common in fermented foods, are claimed to have various beneficial physiological effects on  humans. although the biodegradability of epss is important in relation to the bioactive properties, knowledge on this topic is limited. therefore, the biodegradability of eight epss, six of which were produced by lactic acid bacteria, was compared with microorganisms from human feces or soil. eps-degradation was determined from the decrease in polysaccharide-sugar concentration and by high-performance size exclusion chromatography (hpsec). xanthan, clavan, and the epss produced by streptococcus thermophilus sfi 39 and sfi 12 were readily degraded, in contrast to the epss produced by lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris b40, lactobacillus sakei 0-1, s. thermophilus sfi20, and lactobacillus helveticus lh59. clearly, the susceptibility of exopolysaccharides  to biological breakdown can differ greatly, implying that the physiological effects of these compounds may also vary a lot.

TI  == influence of capsular and ropy exopolysaccharide-producing streptococcus thermophilus on mozzarella cheese and cheese whey.
AB  == we investigated the effect of capsular and ropy exopolysaccharide-producing streptococcus thermophilus starter bacteria on mozzarella cheese functionality and whey viscosity. mozzarella cheeses were manufactured with lactobacillus helveticus lh100 paired with one of four s. thermophilus strains: mr-1c, a bacterium that produces a capsular exopolysaccharide; mtc360, a strain that secretes a ropy exopolysaccharide; tao61, a nonexopolysaccharide-producing commercial cheese starter; and dm10, a nonencapsulated, exopolysaccharide-negative mutant of strain mr-1c. as expected, cheese moisture levels were significantly higher in mozzarella cheeses made with exopolysaccharide-positive versus exopolysaccharide-negative streptococci, and melt properties were better in the higher moisture cheeses. whey viscosity measurements showed that unconcentrated and ultrafiltered, fivefold concentrated  whey from cheeses made with s. thermophilus mtc360 were significantly more viscous than whey from cheeses made with mr-1c, tao61, or dm10. no significant differences were noted between the viscosity of unconcentrated or concentrated whey from cheeses made with s. thermophilus mr-1c versus the industrial cheese starter tao61. these data indicate that encapsulated, but not ropy, exopolysaccharide-producing s. thermophilus strains can be utilized to increase the moisture level of cheese and to improve the melt properties of mozzarella cheese without adversely affecting whey viscosity.

TI  == autolysis and related proteolysis in swiss cheese for two lactobacillus helveticus strains.
AB  == intracellular peptidases of lactobacillus helveticus may play a major role in the proteolysis of swiss cheeses, provided that they are released through bacterial lysis. experimental swiss cheeses were manufactured on a small scale from thermized and microfiltered milk using as starters (in addition to streptococcus  thermophilus and propionibacterium freudenreichii) one of two lb. helveticus strains, itglh1 and itglh77, which undergo lysis to different extents in vitro. all the cheeses were biochemically identical after pressing. the viability of lb. helveticus itglh1 and itglh77 decreased to a similar extent (96-98%) while in the cold room, but the concomitant release of intracellular lactate dehydrogenase in  cheeses made with strain itglh1 was 5-7-fold that in cheeses made with itglh77. protein profiles and immunoblot detection of the dipeptidase pepd confirmed a greater degree of lysis of the itglh1 strain. free active peptidases were detected in aqueous extracts of cheese for both strains, and proteolysis occurred principally in the warm room. reversed-phase hplc revealed a more extensive peptide hydrolysis for itglh1, which was confirmed by the greater release of free nh2 groups (+33%) and free amino acids (+75%) compared with itglh77. as the intracellular peptidase activities of itglh1 and itglh77 have previously been shown to be similar, our results indicated that the extent of lysis of lb. helveticus could have a direct impact on the degree of proteolysis in swiss cheeses.

TI  == proinflammatory cytokine and nitric oxide induction in murine macrophages by cell wall and cytoplasmic extracts of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == cells from a number of bacterial genera have been shown to possess mitogenic and  polyclonal activating properties when cultured with cells of the immune system. based on previously reported health immune-enhancing effects of fermented dairy products, we tested the potentiating effects of representative lactic acid bacteria and their extracts on leukocyte function. specifically, the effects of in vitro exposure to heat-killed cells of bifidobacterium, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei, l. gasseri, l. helveticus, l. reuteri, and  streptococcus thermophilus, their cell walls, and their cytoplasmic extracts on proliferation as well as cytokine and nitric oxide (no) production were examined  in the raw 264.7 macrophage cell line. a similar strategy was applied to murine cultures composed of peritoneal, spleen, and peyer's patch cells. both the cell wall and cytoplasmic fractions of lactic acid bacteria were able to stimulate cloned macrophages to produce significant amounts of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, (interleukin) il-6, and no. pronounced enhancement of il-6 production by peritoneal cells was observed when cultured with those extracts, whereas, effects were not noted in spleen and peyer's patch cell cultures from mice. based on the  results, it appears that, as a group, the lactic acid bacteria were capable of stimulating macrophages and possibly other immune cells to produce cytokines and  no, and both their cell walls and cytoplasm contributed to these capacities.

TI  == conservation of the major cold shock protein in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == primers designed from consensus regions of the major cold shock gene of different bacterial species were used in pcr amplification of lactic acid bacteria (lab). an appropriately-sized pcr product was obtained from lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ll43-1 and mg1363; lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris lc10-1, lc11-1, and  lc12-1; streptococcus thermophilus st1-1; enterococcus faecalis ef1-1; lactobacillus acidophilus la1-1; lactobacillus helveticus lh1-1; pediococcus pentosaceus pp1-1; and bifidobacterium animalis ba1-1. the pcr products were cloned and sequenced. the deduced amino acid sequences displayed high sequence similarity with the major cold shock proteins of escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis and the human y-box factor. the amino acid residues of the cold shock domain implicated in nucleic acid binding in several unrelated species were also  highly conserved in the lab strains. it is possible, therefore, that this protein in lab may also act as a transcriptional enhancer to other cold shock genes and/or act as an rna chaperone unwinding tightly folded rna molecules.

TI  == characterization of bacteriocins produced by strains from traditional bulgarian dairy products.

TI  == preliminary characterization of microflora of comte cheese.
AB  == the evolution of the microflora of three comte cheeses made in duplicate with raw milk from three different sources was followed during ripening. the same starter  was used with each type of milk. the comparison of the cheeses did not reveal any significant difference in the development of the microflora. starter lactic acid  bacteria (streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus helveticus), which are added at the beginning of manufacture, decreased quickly in the first stages of ripening supporting the hypothesis of cell autolysis. other microorganisms, i.e.  homofermentative and heterofermentative lactobacilli (lact. delbrueckii ssp. lactis, lact. paracasei ssp. paracasei, lact. rhamnosus and lact. fermentum), pediococci, enterococci and propionibacteria grew in cheese from small numbers in fresh curd. the characterization of strep. thermophilus by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed that wild strains were also able to grow in the curd. the  values for the genome size of 11 strep. thermophilus strains determined in this investigation were in the range of 1.8-2.3 mbp. the potential role of starter and raw milk microflora in cheese flavour development was considered.

TI  == role of streptococcus thermophilus mr-1c capsular exopolysaccharide in cheese moisture retention.
AB  == recent work by our group has shown that an exopolysaccharide (eps)-producing starter pair, streptococcus thermophilus mr-1c and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus mr-1r, can significantly increase moisture retention in low-fat mozzarella (d. b. perry, d. j. mcmahon, and c. j. oberg, j. dairy sci. 80:799-805, 1997). the objectives of this study were to determine whether mr-1c,  mr-1r, or both of these strains are required for enhanced moisture retention and  to establish the role of eps in this phenomenon. analysis of low-fat mozzarella made with different combinations of mr-1c, mr-1r, and the non-eps-producing starter culture strains s. thermophilus ta061 and lactobacillus helveticus lh100  showed that s. thermophilus mr-1c was responsible for the increased cheese moisture level. to investigate the role of the s. thermophilus mr-1c eps in cheese moisture retention, the epse gene in this bacterium was inactivated by gene replacement. low-fat mozzarella made with l. helveticus lh100 plus the non-eps-producing mutant s. thermophilus dm10 had a significantly lower moisture  content than did cheese made with strains lh100 and mr-1c, which confirmed that the mr-1c capsular eps was responsible for the water-binding properties of this bacterium in cheese. chemical analysis of the s. thermophilus mr-1c eps indicated that the polymer has a novel basic repeating unit composed of d-galactose, l-rhamnose, and l-fucose in a ratio of 5:2:1.

TI  == identification of a cold shock gene in lactic acid bacteria and the effect of cold shock on cryotolerance.
AB  == when lactic acid bacterial cultures were frozen at -20 degrees c for 24 h, the cell viability decreased drastically, but when they were cold shocked at 10 degrees c for 2 h prior to freezing, viability improved significantly for the lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis strains (25-37%) and pediococcus pentosaceus po2 (18%), but not for the lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris strains tested or for one strain of lactobacillus helveticus lb1 and streptococcus thermophilus ts2. when the period for cold shock was extended to 5 h, the viability increased even  further for those strains that displayed cold shock cryotolerance. use of degenerate pcr primers based on the major cold shock protein (csp) of both escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis resulted in pcr products from all strains  tested. the pcr product from lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis m474 was cloned and sequenced, and the deduced amino acid sequence displayed a high sequence similarity to other csp's. use of pcr primers based on the m474 sequence resulted in pcr products being produced only from the lactococcal strains studied and not  from the lactobacillus helveticus, streptococcus thermophilus, or pediococcus pentosaceus strains tested.

TI  == development and characterization of lactose-positive pediococcus species for milk fermentation.
AB  == bacteriophages against streptococcus thermophilus are a growing problem in the italian cheese industry. one possible control method involves replacing s. thermophilus in mozzarella starter blends with lactic acid bacteria from a different genus or species. in this study, we evaluated lactose-positive pediococci for this application. because we could not identify any commercially available pediococci with fast acid-producing ability in milk, we transformed pediococcus pentosaceus atcc 25744, p. pentosaceus atcc 25745, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 12697 by electroporation with ppn-1, a 35-kb lactococcus lactis lactose plasmid. transformants of p. pentosaceus atcc 25745 and p. acidilactici atcc 12697 were then used to examine lactose-positive pediococci for properties related to milk fermentation. both transformants rapidly produced acid and efficiently retained ppn-1 in lactose broth, and neither bacterium was attacked by bacteriophages in whey collected from commercial cheese facilities. paired starter combinations of pediococcus spp. and lactobacillus helveticus lh100 exhibited synergistic ph reduction in milk, and small-scale cheese trials showed  that these cultures could be used to manufacture part-skim mozzarella cheese. results demonstrate that lactose-positive pediococci have potential as replacement cocci for s. thermophilus in italian cheese starter blends and may facilitate development of new strain rotation schemes to combat s. thermophilus bacteriophage problems in mozzarella cheese plants.

AB  == epidemiological and in vivo and in vitro experimental studies have suggested that fermented milks may interfere with the emergence and/or the development of colon  cancer. the results, however, remain inconclusive. this prompted us to develop a  new approach based on the use of ht-29, a cultured human colon cancer cell line,  to study at the cellular level the effect of fermented milks on colon cancer cell growth and differentiation characteristics. undifferentiated ht-29 cells have been grown in the continuous presence of milks fermented by one of the following  bacterial populations: lactobacillus helveticus, bifidobacterium, l.acidophilus or a mix of streptococcus thermophilus and l. bulgaricus. penicillin g was added  to the cell culture medium, resulting in a complete blockade of bacterial growth  without significant effect on bacterial viability. one out of the four bacteria species studied, namely l.acidophilus, was without effect on both cell growth and differentiation. the three other bacterial strains induced a significant, although variable, reduction in the growth rate of ht-29 cells, which resulted in a 10-50% decrease in the cell number at steady-state (i.e. at cell confluency). the most efficient strains in lowering the ht-29 growth rate were l. helveticus and bifidobacterium. concomitantly, the specific activities of dipeptidyl peptidase iv (dpp iv), a sensitive and specific marker of ht-29 cell differentiation, and that of three other brush border enzymes (sucrase, aminopeptidase n and alkaline phosphatase) were significantly increased, thus suggesting that these cells may have entered a differentiation process. altogether, these results indicate that the use of cultured colon cancer cells may be a useful tool to further study the effect of fermented milks on colon cancer and that bacterial strains may exert a different and specific effect on cancer cell growth and differentiation when used in fermented milk products.

AB  == an internal fragment of the reca gene from eight gram-positive organisms has been amplified by using degenerate primers in a polymerase chain reaction. the internal 348- or 360-bp reca dna segments from bacillus subtilis, clostridium acetobutylicum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus helveticus, leuconostoc mesanteroides, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus salivarus subsp. thermophilus were amplified, cloned, and sequenced. the g + c contents of the dna from these species range from 28 to 52%. the sequences of the bacterial reca genes show strong relatedness. this method is particularly useful  for the recovery of the reca genes of gram-positive bacteria and avoids the difficulties of using a genetic complementation test for cloning.

TI  == galactose utilization in lactobacillus helveticus: isolation and characterization of the galactokinase (galk) and galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (galt) genes.
AB  == by complementing appropriate gal lesions in escherichia coli k802, we were able to isolate the galactokinase (galk) and galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase  (galt) genes of lactobacillus helveticus. tn10 transposon mutagenesis, together with in vivo complementation analysis and in vitro enzyme activity measurements,  allowed us to map these two genes. the dna sequences of the genes and the flanking regions were determined. these revealed that the two genes are organized in the order galk-galt in an operonlike structure. in an in vitro transcription-translation assay, the galk and galt gene products were identified  as 44- and 53-kda proteins, respectively, data which corresponded well with the dna sequencing data. the deduced amino acid sequence of the galk gene product showed significant homologies to other prokaryotic and eukaryotic galactokinase sequences, whereas galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase did not show any sequence similarities to other known proteins. this observation, together with a  comparison of known gal operon structures, suggested that the l. helveticus operon developed independently to a translational expression unit having a different gene order than that in e. coli, streptococcus lividans, or saccharomyces cerevisiae. dna sequencing of the flanking regions revealed an open reading frame downstream of the galkt operon. it was tentatively identified as galm (mutarotase) on the basis of the significant amino acid sequence homology with the corresponding streptococcus thermophilus gene.

TI  == inhibition of clostridium tyrobutyricum by bacteriocin-like substances produced by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria were selected for their inhibitory activity against clostridium tyrobutyricum under conditions that eliminate the effects of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide. four strains were isolated belonging to the species lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. the sensitivity of the inhibitory substances to pronase and trypsine indicates that they are proteins or peptides different from  nisin. their resistance to phospholipase d indicates that they are also different from lactostrepcin. the inhibitory substances are produced during the exponential phase of growth. their activity is bactericidal and directed toward some strains  of clostridium tyrobutyricum, lactobacillus helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus, but strains used as dairy starters, lactobacillus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, and propionibacterium shermanii, are not all affected by the inhibition.

TI  == evidence for the conjugal transfer of the broad host range plasmid pip501 into strains of lactobacillus helveticus.
AB  == the conjugative broad host range plasmid pip501 was transferred from streptococcus faecalis to a series of strains of lactic streptococci used commercially as dairy starter cultures. with these transconjugants as donors the  plasmid was exconjugated to two strains of lactobacillus helveticus and a commercially used strain of strep. thermophilus. there was evidence that the plasmid could transfer between isogenic derivatives of one of the strains of lact. helveticus. transfer from lact. helveticus to strep. faecalis was also detected but at a low frequency. there was no evidence for the conjugal transfer  of plasmid pip501 into a strain of lact. bulgaricus by exconjugation from either  lactic streptococci or lactobacillus sp.

TI  == fermentation of aqueous plant seed extracts by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the effects of lactic acid bacterial fermentation on chemical and physical changes in aqueous extracts of cowpea (vigna unguiculata), peanut (arachis hypogea), soybean (glycine max), and sorghum (sorghum vulgare) were studied. the  bacteria investigated were lactobacillus helveticus, l. delbrueckii, l. casei, l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, and streptococcus thermophilus. organisms were inoculated individually into all of the seed extracts; l. bulgaricus and s. thermophilus were also evaluated together as inocula for fermenting the legume extracts. during fermentation, bacterial population and changes in titratable acidity, ph, viscosity, and color were measured over a 72-h period at 37 degrees  c. maximum bacterial populations, titratable acidity, ph, and viscosity varied depending upon the type of extract and bacterial strain. the maximum population of each organism was influenced by fermentable carbohydrates, which, in turn, influenced acid production and change in ph. change in viscosity was correlated with the amount of protein and titratable acidity of products. color was affected by pasteurization treatment and fermentation as well as the source of extract. in the extracts inoculated simultaneously with l. bulgaricus and s. thermophilus, a  synergistic effect resulted in increased bacterial populations, titratable acidity, and viscosity, and decreased ph in all the legume extracts when compared to the extracts fermented with either of these organisms individually. fermented  extracts offer potential as substitutes for cultured dairy products.

TI  == effect of the addition of extracts of thermophilic lactobacilli on acid production by streptococcus thermophilus in milk.
AB  == soluble extracts of 20 strains of thermophilic lactobacilli (lactobacillus helveticus, l. lactis and l. bulgaricus) were prepared and added to milk for the  culture of 10 strains of streptococcus thermophilus. acid production was stimulated in 64.5% of cases for 9 of these 10 strains. the l. helveticus extracts were the most stimulatory, but the same extracts did not always strongly stimulate each strain of str. thermophilus. the stimulatory effects observed varied with the volume of extract and the strain of str. thermophilus. the exception was str. thermophilus 385, which was never stimulated. the stimulatory  effects observed were due to aminopeptidases present in the lactobacillus extracts and were not related to a general caseinolytic activity. the possible addition of such extracts to milk for cooked hard cheese is discussed.
