TI  == effects of lactobacillus salivarius ren on cancer prevention and intestinal microbiota in 1, 2-dimethylhydrazine-induced rat model.
AB  == probiotics have been suggested as a prophylactic measure in colon cancer. the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of lactobacillus salivarius ren (ren) in modulating colonic microbiota structure and colon cancer incidence in a rat model after injection with 1,2-dimethyl hydrazine (dmh). the results indicated that oral administration of ren could effectively suppress dmh-induced colonic carcinogenesis. a significant decrease in cancer incidence (87.5% to 25%) was detected in rats fed with a dose of 5 x 1010 cfu/kg bodyweight per day. using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and real-time pcr combined with multivariate statistical methods, we demonstrated that injection with dmh significantly altered the rat gut microbiota, while ren counteracted these dmh-induced adverse effects and promoted reversion of the gut microbiota close to the healthy state. tvalue biplots followed by band sequencing identified 21 bacterial strains as critical variables affected by dmh and ren. injection of dmh significantly increased the amount of ruminococcus species (sp.) and clostridiales bacteria, as well as decreasing the prevotella sp. administration of ren reduced the amount of ruminococcus sp., clostridiales bacteria, and bacteroides dorei, and increased the amount of prevotella. real-time pcr results  were consistent with the results derived by t-value biplots. these findings suggested that ren is a potential agent for colon cancer prevention. in conclusion, the results in the present study suggest a potential therapeutic approach based on the modulation of intestinal microflora by probiotics may be beneficial in the prevention of colorectal carcinogenesis.

TI  == the inhibitory effect of polyphenols on human gut microbiota.
AB  == the intestinal microbiota (im) is responsible for metabolism of many compounds provided in the diet, such as polyphenols, increasing their bioavailability. however, there are remarkably few studies investigating the influence of polyphenols on the composition and activity of the gut microbial community. this  study evaluated the influence of the polyphenols naringenin (n), naringin (nr), hesperetin (h), hesperidin (hr), quercetin (q), rutin (qr), and catechin (cat) on the growth of human im representatives (bacteroides galacturonicus, lactobacillus sp., enterococcus caccae, bifidobacterium catenulatum, ruminococcus gauvreauii, escherichia coli). polyphenols were added to liquid medium at a final concentration of 20, 100 or 250 mug/ml (for q concentrations were 4, 20 or 50 mug/ml) and their impact on the im was assessed by measurement of the turbidity after 24-h culture. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) for polyphenols that inhibited bacteria was estimated. cat had no impact on the tested im. q had  the strongest impact on r. gauvreauii, b. galacturonicus and lactobacillus sp. (mic 20-50 mug/ml) growth, whilst its rutinoside had no impact. nr and hr had no  impact, but their aglycones n and h inhibited growth of almost all analyzed bacteria (mic >/=250 mug/ml). we conclude that flavonoid aglycones, but not their glycosides, may inhibit growth of some intestinal bacteria. this means that polyphenols probably can modulate the im and indirectly interfere with their own  bioavailability.

TI  == dysbiosis of fecal microbiota in crohn's disease patients as revealed by a custom phylogenetic microarray.
AB  == background: a custom phylogenetic microarray composed of small subunit ribosomal  rna probes, representing approximately 500 bacterial species from the human and animal gut, was developed and evaluated for analysis of gut microbial diversity using fecal samples from healthy subjects and crohn's disease (cd) patients. methods: oligonucleotide probes ( approximately 40 mer) used on the microarray were selected from published articles or designed with the "goarray" microarray probe design program using selected bacterial 16s rrna sequences. fecal 16s rdna  from individual samples of six healthy subjects and six cd patients were used as  template to generate fluorescently labeled crna that was hybridized to the microarray. differences revealed by the microarray in relative abundance of microbial populations between healthy and diseased patients were verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with species-specific primer sets. results: the microarray analyses showed that eubacterium rectale, bacteroides fragilis group, b. vulgatus, ruminococcus albus, r. callidus, r. bromii, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii were 5-10-fold more abundant in the healthy subjects than in the cd patients, while enterococcus sp., clostridium difficile, escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, and listeria sp. were more abundant in the cd group. conclusions: the microarray detected differences in abundance of bacterial populations within the phylum firmicutes that had been reported previously for the same samples based on phylogenetic analysis of metagenomic clone libraries. in addition, the microarray showed that enterococcus sp. was in higher abundance in the cd patients. this microarray should be another useful tool to examine the diversity and abundance of human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == detection and identification of rumen bacteria constituting a fibrolytic consortium dominated by fibrobacter succinogenes.
AB  == a fibrolytic consortium, dominated by the rumen cellulolytic bacterium fibrobacter succinogenes, was artificially constructed on hay stems to detect and identify rumen bacteria that can potentially interact with f. succinogenes. consortium-bacterial members were determined by dgge and sequencing analysis targeted bacterial 16s rdna. an artificial consortium was formed in a 2-step incubation of hay stems; the first step with group 1, 2 or 3 f. succinogenes strains, the second step with rumen fluid. after consortium formation, morphologically different bacteria were observed in association with f. succinogenes. dgge exhibited more than 30 bands, the pattern of which depended on the f. succinogenes group. sequencing suggested that butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, clostridium sp., f. succinogenes group 2, prevotella  ruminicola and unclassified bacteroides were prominent in the group 1 consortium  and that treponema bryantii, b. fibrisolvens, acinetobacter sp, and wolinella succinogenes were prominent in the group 2 consortium. however, in the group 3 consortium, f. succinogenes-like bacteria were microscopically undetectable, whereas cellulolytic ruminococcus albus and f. succinogenes group 1 were prominent, suggesting that the group 3 cannot be a core member of this consortium. this study is the first attempt to identify bacterial members of a fibrolytic consortium dominated by a specific bacterium.

TI  == mode of delivery affects the bacterial community in the newborn gut.
AB  == the first colonisation of the intestine is one of the most profound immunological exposures faced by the newborn and it is influenced by external and internal factors. the early composition of human microbiota could have long-lasting metabolic effects and the initial composition of human intestinal bacteria is also known to affect postnatal immune system development, as we are already aware that reduced microbial stimulation during infancy would result in slower postnatal maturation of the immune system and development of an optimal balance between th1 and th2-like immunity. mode of delivery has a major role on the composition of intestinal microbiota in early infancy, as it has been shown that  infants born by caesarean section (cs) have lower numbers of bifidobacteria and bacteroides compared with vaginally born infants. we designed a study to investigate the influence of mode of delivery (cs vs. vaginal delivery) on intestinal microbial composition on day 3 of life using pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and pcr-temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (tgge). both dgge and tgge analyses have been used, together with the specific amplifications for 10 bifidobacterium sp., 3 ruminococcus sp., and bacteroides that all have a highly relevant physiological role in the intestinal ecosystem of the newborn. a total of 46 term infants were enrolled in the study, consecutively recruiting all the cs-delivered babies (n=23; 8 males and 15 females) and the immediately following spontaneously delivered babies (n=23; 11 males and 12 females). dgge analysis carried out with bifidobacterium-specific primers revealed the presence of this genus in 13 of 23 (56.5%) samples derived from vaginally delivered newborns but in none of the samples obtained from newborns delivered by cs. pcr analysis with bifidobacterium-species-specific primers showed that naturally delivered infants had a large number of bifidobacterial species, whereas in cs-delivered babies only two samples (8.7%) gave positive results, one for b. longum and another for b. gallicum. in all babies enrolled, micro-organisms belonging to ruminococcus species were absent and bacteroides was found in 8.7% of spontaneously delivered babies only. based on our findings, it seems that newborn's intestinal bacteria during the first 3days of life are strongly influenced by mode of delivery. the intestinal flora of cs and vaginally delivered infants appears to be very different; the former being altered and characterised by a substantial absence of bifidobacteria sp., the latter characterised by subject-specific microbial profiles, although predominant groups such as b. longum and b. catenulatum could be identified. in summary, mode of delivery does affect the early stage of intestinal bacterial colonisation, which  is altered in cs-delivered infants compared with vaginally delivered infants, with only a minor influence of the type of feeding. in addition, the importance of methodological aspects for determining intestinal microbiota in clinical trials requires emphasis if intestinal microbiota composition is to be considered a measure of postnatal adaptation.

TI  == effects of long-term ingestion of difructose anhydride iii (dfa iii) on intestinal bacteria and bile acid metabolism in humans.
AB  == changes in the intestinal microbiota of 10 human subjects with long-term ingestion of 3 g/d difructose anhydride iii (dfa iii; 4 persons, 2 months; 3 persons, 6 months; and 3 persons, 12 months) were examined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). according to the answers to questionnaires, the subjects were divided into two groups (constipated and normal). the dgge profile  was different for every individual and each subject had unique profiles of intestinal microbiota. in the dgge profiles of constipated subjects, the intensities of bands related to bacteroides spp. increased. moreover, the dfa iii-assimilating bacteria, ruminococcus sp. were isolated from subjects who ingested dfa iii for 12 months. these strains showed 95% similarity of their 16s  rdna sequences with that of ruminococcus obeum atcc 29174(t) (x85101) and produced large amounts of acetic acid. dfa iii ingestion for 2 months tended to increase total organic acids in feces, and tended to decrease fecal ph and the secondary bile acid (sba) ratio in total bile acids. the sba ratio in total bile  acids corresponded to fecal ph. the production of sba was decreased by low ph in  vitro. these results indicated that dfa iii ingestion in humans tended to lower intestinal ph, inhibited bile acid 7alpha-dehydroxylation activities and also tended to decrease the sba ratios in total bile acids. moreover, as another cause for the decrease in the sba ratio in total bile acids, it was suggested that the  number of bile acid 7alpha-dehydroxylating bacteria were decreased by dfa iii ingestion.

TI  == effects of difructose anhydride iii (dfa iii) administration on rat intestinal microbiota.
AB  == the effects of difructose anhydride iii (di-d-fructofuranose-1,2':2,3'-dianhydride; dfa iii) administration (3% dfa iii for 4 weeks) on rat intestinal microbiota were examined using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). according to dgge profiles, the number of bacteria related to bacteroides acidofaciens and uncultured bacteria within the clostridium lituseburense group decreased, while that of bacteria related to bacteroides vulgatus, bacteroides uniformis and ruminococcus productus increased  in dfa iii-fed rat cecum. in the cecal contents of dfa iii-fed rats, a lowering of ph and an increase in short chain fatty acids (scfas), especially acetic acid, were observed. the dfa iii-assimilating bacterium, ruminococcus sp. m-1, was isolated from the cecal contents of dfa iii-fed rats. the strain had 98% similarity with r. productus atcc 27340t (l76595), and mainly produced acetic acid. these results confirmed that the bacteria harmful to host health were not increased by dfa iii administration. moreover, dfa iii stimulated the growth of ruminococcus sp. m-1 producing acetic acid, which may alter the intestinal microbiota towards a healthier composition. it is expected that dfa iii would be  a new candidate as a prebiotic.

TI  == interaction between h2-producing and non-h2-producing cellulolytic bacteria from  the human colon.
AB  == the cellulose-degrading species recently isolated from the human colon showed diverse ability to degrade and ferment cellulose. in the present study, the nature of the inter-relation existing between one h(2)-producing cellulolytic isolate (ruminococcus sp. nov.) and one non-h(2)-producing cellulose-degrading species (bacteroides sp. nov.) was investigated in vitro. coculture experiments revealed synergism in cellulose degradation between these two cellulolytic species. an increase in total bacterial population was measured in the coculture, bacteroides sp. being the predominant organism. as a result, a large decrease in  h(2) production from cellulose fermentation was observed. predominance of bacteroides sp. might thus contribute to limit gas produced from fibre fermentation in the gut.

TI  == effects of alternative dietary substrates on competition between human colonic bacteria in an anaerobic fermentor system.
AB  == duplicate anaerobic fermentor systems were used to examine changes in a community of human fecal bacteria supplied with different carbohydrate energy sources. a panel of group-specific fluorescent in situ hybridization probes targeting 16s rrna sequences revealed that the fermentors supported growth of a greater proportion of bacteroides and a lower proportion of gram-positive anaerobes related to faecalibacterium prausnitzii, ruminococcus flavefaciens-ruminococcus bromii, eubacterium rectale-clostridium coccoides, and eubacterium cylindroides than the proportions in the starting fecal inoculum. nevertheless, certain substrates, such as dahlia inulin, caused a pronounced increase in the number of  bacteria related to r. flavefaciens-r. bromii and e. cylindroides. the ability of three strictly anaerobic, gram-positive bacteria to compete with the complete human fecal flora was tested in the same experiment by using selective plating to enumerate the introduced strains. the roseburia-related strain a2-183(f) was able to grow on all substrates despite the fact that it was unable to utilize complex  carbohydrates in pure culture, and it was assumed that this organism survived by  cross-feeding. in contrast, roseburia intestinalis l1-82(r) and eubacterium sp. strain a2-194(r) survived less well despite the fact that they were able to utilize polysaccharides in pure culture, except that a2-194(r) was stimulated 100-fold by inulin. these results suggest that many low-g+c-content gram-positive obligate anaerobes may be selected against during in vitro incubation, although several groups were stimulated by inulin. thus, considerable caution is necessary when workers attempt to predict the in vivo effects of probiotics and prebiotics  from their effects in vitro.

TI  == seasonal changes in the adherent microflora of the rumen in high-arctic svalbard  reindeer.
AB  == seasonal changes in bacterial colonization of the epithelial tissue were examined in the rumen of high-arctic svalbard reindeer. samples of tissue were collected from eight sites in the rumen of reindeer during summer and winter and bacterial  colonization was examined using scanning and transmission electron microscopy. at two of these sites, colonization by adherent bacteria was estimated to cover approximately 30% of the ruminal epithelium in specimens collected from reindeer  during summer. bacteria at these sites resembled ruminococcus sp. and were surrounded by large amounts of glycocalyx. in winter specimens, less than 10% of  the epithelial surface was covered by adherent bacteria. those bacteria that did  colonize the epithelial surface were smaller and had virtually no glycocalyx on their surface. bacteria attached to plant cell wall material in summer samples of reindeer ingesta contained large intracellular glycogen deposits, whereas feed particle-associated bacteria in ingesta collected in winter contained no intracellular glycogen. these data demonstrate that the ruminal bacterial population responds to seasonal changes in feed intake and quality. it is yet to  be determined if these bacterial changes enhance the ability of svalbard reindeer to survive in the hostile environment of the high arctic.

TI  == ruminal cellulolytic bacteria and protozoa from bison, cattle-bison hybrids, and  cattle fed three alfalfa-corn diets.
AB  == ruminal cellulolytic bacteria and protozoa and in vitro digestibility of alfalfa  fiber fractions were compared among bison, bison hybrids, and crossbed cattle (five each) when they were fed alfalfa and corn in a ratio of 100:0, 75:25, and 50:50, respectively. the total number of viable bacteria (2.16 x 10(9) to 5.44 x  10(9)/ml of ruminal fluid) and the number of cellulolytic bacteria (3.74 x 10(7)  to 10.9 x 10(7)/ml) were not different among groups of animals fed each diet. the genera of protozoa in all of the animal groups were similar; however, when either the 100:0 or 50:50 diet was used the percentage of entodinium sp. was lower and the percentage of diplodiniinae was higher (p less than 0.05) in bison than in bison hybrids or cattle. bacteroides succinogenes made up the largest number of cellulolytic isolates from bison (58 and 36%, respectively, on the 100:0 and 75:25 diets), which were more numerous (p less than 0.05) than those from bison hybrids (36 and 12%) and cattle (33 and 18%). this was offset by a lower number of cellulolytic butyrivibrio isolates. the numbers of ruminococcus albus and r. flavefaciens isolates, in general, were similar among the bovid species, although r. flavefaciens generally made up less than 10% of the cellulolytic isolates. in  vitro digestibility coefficients were greater (p less than 0.05) for the bison when the 75:25 diet was used and similar for the other two diets. the concentration of ruminal volatile fatty acids was larger (p less than 0.05) in bison than in bison hybrids and cattle when the 50:50 diet was used.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == enumeration and isolation of cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic bacteria from human feces.
AB  == the fibrolytic microbiota of the human large intestine was examined to determine  the numbers and types of cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic bacteria present. fecal samples from each of five individuals contained bacteria capable of degrading the hydrated cellulose in spinach and in wheat straw pretreated with alkaline hydrogen peroxide (ahp-ws), whereas degradation of the relatively crystalline cellulose in whatman no. 1 filter paper (pmc) was detected for only one of the five samples. the mean concentration of cellulolytic bacteria, estimated with ahp-ws as a substrate, was 1.2 x 10(8)/ml of feces. pure cultures  of bacteria isolated on ahp-ws were able to degrade pmc, indicating that interactions with other microbes were primarily responsible for previous low success rates in detecting fecal cellulolytic bacteria with pmc as a substrate. the cellulolytic bacteria included ruminococcus spp., clostridium sp., and two unidentified strains. the mean concentration of hemicellulolytic bacteria, estimated with larchwood xylan as a substrate, was 1.8 x 10(10)/ml of feces. the  hemicellulose-degrading bacteria included butyrivibrio sp., clostridium sp., bacteroides sp., and two unidentified strains, as well as four of the five cellulolytic strains. this work demonstrates that many humans harbor intestinal cellulolytic bacteria and that a hydrated cellulose source such as ahp-ws is necessary for their consistent detection and isolation.

TI  == isolation and presumptive identification of adherent epithelial bacteria ("epimural" bacteria) from the ovine rumen wall.
AB  == one hundred sixty-one strains of adherent bacteria were isolated under anaerobic  conditions from four sites on the rumen epithelial surface of sheep fed hay or a  hay-grain ration. before isolation of bacteria, rumen tissue was washed six times in an anaerobic dilution solution, and viable bacteria suspended in the washings  were counted. calculation indicated that unattached bacteria would have been removed from the tissue by this procedure, but a slow and progressive release of  attached bacteria also occurred. nevertheless, a wide range of characteristic morphological types remained associated with the epithelium as demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy. most of these types were represented among the isolates. characterization and presumptive identification of the isolates showed  that 95.0% belonged to previously described genera of functionally significant rumen bacteria, including butyrivibrio sp. (31.1%), bacteroides sp. (22.4%), selenomonas ruminantium (9.9%), succinivibrio dextrinosolvens (8.7%), streptococcus bovis (8.1%), propionibacterium sp. (4.3%), treponema sp. (3.1%), and eubacterium sp., lachnospira multiparus, and ruminococcus flavefaciens (2.5%  each). eight isolates (5.0%) were not identified. l. multiparus was recovered only from hay-fed animals; all other genera were obtained from animals fed either ration. all s. bovis strains and two strains each of bacteroides sp. and butyrivibrio sp. were aerotolerant; all other strains were strictly anaerobic. bacteria representing the gram-positive, facultatively anaerobic flora associated with rumen wall tissue (r. j. wallace, k.-j. cheng, d. dinsdale, and e. r. orskov, nature (london) 279:424-426, 1979) were therefore not recovered by the techniques used; instead a different fraction of the adherent population was isolated. the term "epimural" is proposed to describe the flora associated with the rumen epithelium.

TI  == urease assay and urease-producing species of anaerobes in the bovine rumen and human feces.
AB  == a growth medium and test were developed for rapid detection of urease in fermentative anaerobic bacteria. using nonselective rumen fluid roll-tube agar medium and the new test, it was confirmed that peptostreptococcus productus is often the most numerous urease-forming species in human feces. also, some fecal strains of ruminococcus albus, clostridium innocuum, and clostridium beijerinckii produced urease. single strains of fusobacterium prausnitzii, coprococcus catus,  and streptococcus mitis that were strongly ureolytic on isolation later lost this ability. urease activity was also detected in many strains of nonselectively isolated rumen species. they include succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, treponema sp., ruminococcus bromii (not previously known to be present in the rumen), butyrivibrio sp., bifidobacterium sp., bacteroides ruminicola, and p. productus.  most p. productus strains contain urease; however, the uniformity of this feature in the other species noted above is not known. the urease in many of these species was not detected if the growth medium contained 0.2% or more (each) yeast extract and trypticase.

TI  == fermentation of isolated pectin and pectin from intact forages by pure cultures of rumen bacteria.
AB  == studies on the rate and extent of galacturonic acid and isolated pectin digestion were carried out with nine strains of rumen bacteria (butyrivibrio fibrisolvens h10b and d16f, bacteroides ruminicola 23 and d31d, lachnospira multiparus d15d, peptostreptococcus sp. d43e, b. succinogenes a3c, ruminococcus flavefaciens b34b, and r. albus 7). only three strains, 23, d16f, and d31d, utilized galacturonic acid as a sole energy source, whereas all strains except a3c and h10b degraded (solubilized) and utilized purified pectin. nutrient composition of the basal medium and separate sterilization of the substrate affected the rate and extent of fermentation for both substrates. pectin degradation and utilization were measured with two maturity stages each of intact bromegrass and alfalfa. for bromegrass i, all strains tested (b34b, 23, d16f, d31d, d15d, and d43e) degraded  a considerable amount of pectin and, with the exception of b34b, utilized most of what was degraded. similar, but lower, results were obtained with bromegrass ii,  except for the two strains of b. ruminicola, 23 and d31d, which were unable to degrade and utilize pectin from this forage. all strains were able to degrade and utilize pectin from both maturity stages of alfalfa; however, values were considerably lower for strains 23 and d31d. synergism studies, in which a limited utilizing strain, b34b, was combined with the limited degrading strain, d31d, resulted in a slight increase in degradation and a very marked increase in utilization of the pectin in all four forages. similar results were obtained on both alfalfa substrates with a combination of strains b34b and d16f; however, no  increases were observed with this combination on bromegrass.
