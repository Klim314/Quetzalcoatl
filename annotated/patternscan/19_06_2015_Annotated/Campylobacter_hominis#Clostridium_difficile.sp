TI  == case-control comparison of bacterial and protozoan microorganisms associated with gastroenteritis: application of molecular detection.
AB  == the introduction of molecular detection of infectious organisms has led to increased numbers of positive findings, as observed for pathogens causing gastroenteritis (ge). however, because little is known about the prevalence of these pathogens in the healthy asymptomatic population, the clinical value of these additional findings is unclear. a case-control study was carried out in a population of patients served by general practitioners in the netherlands. a total of 2710 fecal samples from case and matched control subjects were subjected to multiplex real-time pcr for the 11 most common bacterial and four protozoal causes of ge. of 1515 case samples, 818 (54%) were positive for one or more target organisms. a total of 49% of the controls were positive. higher positivity rates in cases compared to controls were observed for campylobacter spp., salmonella spp., clostridium difficile, enteroinvasive escherichia coli/shigella  spp., enterotoxigenic e. coli, enteroaggregative e. coli, atypical enteropathogenic e. coli (epec), cryptosporidium parvum/hominis, and giardia lamblia. however, dientamoeba fragilis and shiga-like toxigenic e. coli were detected significantly less frequent in cases than in controls, while no difference in prevalence was found for typical epec and enterohemorrhagic e. coli. the association between the presence of microorganisms and ge was the weakest in children aged 0 to 5 years. higher relative loads in cases further support causality. this was seen for campylobacter spp., salmonella spp., enterotoxigenic e. coli, and c. parvum/hominis, and for certain age categories of those infected with c. difficile, enteroaggregative e. coli, and atypical epec. for d. fragilis and shiga-like toxigenic e. coli/enterohemorrhagic e. coli, pathogen loads were lower in cases. application of molecular diagnostics in ge is rapid, sensitive and specific, but results should be interpreted with care, using clinical and additional background information.

TI  == etiologic agents of diarrhea in solid organ recipients.
AB  == after transplantation, diarrhea may be caused by infectious agents, drug-specific effects, metabolic conditions, or mechanical complications of surgery. determining the cause helps to determine whether to initiate antimicrobial therapy and the duration of treatment. in this study we aimed to determine the causes of diarrhea in kidney or liver recipients. fifty-two diarrhea episodes among 43 solid organ recipients were evaluated. the cause of diarrhea was detected in 43 patients (82.6%). infectious etiologies accounted for 33 out of the 43 episodes (76.7%) in which a specific cause was determined: giardia lamblia in 9, cryptosporidium parvum in 7, cytomegalovirus (cmv) in 6, clostridium difficile in 3, campylobacter jejuni in 2, shigella sonnei in 2, salmonella enteritidis in 1, rotavirus in 1, entamoeba histolytica in 1, and blastocystis hominis in 1. non-infectious etiologies were found for 10 episodes (23.3%): mycophenolate mofetil-associated diarrhea in 5, antibiotic-associated diarrhea in 2, colchicine-associated diarrhea in 2, and laxative drug-associated in 1. non-infectious etiologies seem to be relatively common causes of diarrhea among transplant recipients. therapy was adjusted in 5 patients because of mycophenolate mofetil-associated diarrhea. cmv and c. parvum, which are seldom seen in the normal population, were frequent causes of diarrhea in this group. evaluating the transplant recipients for non-infectious causes of diarrhea is important in prompt diagnosis and treatment.

TI  == etiology of diarrhea in pediatric outpatient settings.
AB  == background: the frequency with which bacteria cause diarrhea evaluated in ambulatory settings is often unknown. we attempted to determine the microbiologic etiology of diarrhea in a private pediatric practice (site a) and a clinic serving largely immigrant children (site b) and to establish guidelines for bacterial culture. methods: children with diarrhea were prospectively enrolled, and their stools were examined for diarrheagenic bacteria, viruses and parasites. results: a total of 123 and 103 children were enrolled at sites a and b, respectively. stools from all (100%), 126 (55.8%), 104 (46.0%) and 75 (33.2%) were tested for bacterial enteric pathogens, parasites, clostridium difficile toxin and viruses, respectively. of the 75 patients whose stool underwent complete testing, 36 (48%) contained at least 1 definitive or plausible pathogen. twelve stools (5.3%) tested positive for bacteria [campylobacter jejuni (n = 7),  yersinia enterocolitica, shigella flexneri, shigella sonnei, salmonella serogroup d and salmonella braenderup (n = 1 each)]. one contained blastocystis hominis, 8  contained c. difficile toxin and 16 contained viruses (9 rotavirus, 5 adenovirus  and 2 astrovirus). visible fecal blood (p = 0.029), increased stool frequency (p  = 0.035), abdominal tenderness (p = 0.011) and fecal white (p < 0.001) or red blood cells (p = 0.002) were associated with bacterial infection. all children with stool yielding diarrheagenic bacteria or c. difficile toxin had at least 1 of these factors, but so did 75% of children without these agents (positive predictive value, 11%; negative predictive value, 100%; sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 25%). conclusions: the bacterial diarrhea prevalence is similar to that in other ambulatory studies, although the spectrum differs. exclusion criteria for stool testing in diarrhea remain elusive. studies to determine the etiology of unexplained diarrhea and cost-effective algorithms for diarrhea diagnosis, are needed.

TI  == enteric infection in relapse of inflammatory bowel disease: importance of microbiological examination of stool.
AB  == objective: previous reports have suggested that diarrhoeal relapses of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) may be associated or confused with enteric infection, and that treatment of such infections with appropriate antibiotics may be beneficial. to re-evaluate the suggestion that enteric infection is rare and microbiological testing of stool not routinely necessary in patients presenting with relapse of ibd, we have reviewed the incidence of concurrent infection in patients presenting in relapse over a recent 5-year period. methods: stool microbiology results relating to relapses of ibd during the period 1997-2001 were obtained retrospectively. relapse was confirmed by standard clinical, sigmoidoscopic and laboratory criteria. results: during the period 1997-2001 there were 237 relapses in 213 patients. enteric infection was found in 25 (10.5%) relapses in 24 patients; in seven patients, infection was associated with the initial presentation of their ibd. clostridium difficile toxin was detected in 13 (5.5%) instances; the 12 other infections (5% relapses) were campylobacter  spp. (five), entamoeba histolytica (three), salmonella spp. (one), plesiomonas shigelloides (one), strongyloides stercoralis (one) and blastocystis hominis (one). there was a significant association between infection and the need for hospital admission. of the 13 relapses associated with c. difficile, ten were in  outpatients, seven patients had undergone previous antibiotic treatment, and four patients were presenting with ibd for the first time. all relapses resolved satisfactorily after treatment with antibiotics with or without corticosteroids.  conclusions: the high prevalence of enteric infections, of which c. difficile was the most common, indicates that all patients presenting with relapse of ibd should have stool examined microbiologically.

TI  == enteropathogens associated with acute diarrhea in community and hospital patients in jakarta, indonesia.
AB  == the prevalence of bacteria, parasite and viral pathogens in 3875 patients with diarrhea in community and hospital settings from march 1997 through august 1999 in jakarta, indonesia was determined using routine bacteriology and molecular assay techniques. bacterial pathogens isolated from hospital patients were, in decreasing frequency, vibrio cholerae o1, shigella flexneri, salmonella spp. and  campylobacter jejuni, while s. flexneri, v. cholerae o1, salmonella spp. and c. jejuni were isolated from the community patients. v. cholerae o1 was isolated more frequently (p<0.005) from the hospital patients than the community patients. overall, bacterial pathogens were isolated from 538 of 3875 (14%) enrolled cases  of diarrhea. enterotoxigenic escherichia coli were detected in 218 (18%) of 1244  rectal swabs. a small percentage of enterohemorrhagic e. coli (1%) and of clostridium difficile (1.3%) was detected. parasitic examination of 389 samples resulted in 43 (11%) positives comprising ascaris lumbricoides (1.5%), blastocystis hominis (5.7%), giardia lamblia (0.8%), trichuris trichiura (2.1%) and endolimax nana (0.5%). rotavirus (37.5%), adenovirus (3.3%) and norwalk-like  virus (17.6%) were also detected. antimicrobial resistance was observed among some isolates. bacterial isolates were susceptible to quinolones, with the exception of some isolates of c. jejuni which were resistant to ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid and norfloxacin. data obtained from this community- and hospital-based study will enable the indonesian ministry of health to plan relevant studies on diarrheal diseases in the archipelago.

TI  == enteropathogens in adult patients with diarrhea and healthy control subjects: a 1-year prospective study in a swedish clinic for infectious diseases.
AB  == a 1-year prospective study was conducted to identify enteropathogens in adults with diarrhea (n=851) and in healthy control subjects (n=203) by use of conventional laboratory methods. virulence factor genes for diarrheagenic escherichia coli were detected by polymerase chain reaction. enteropathogens were identified in 56% of patients and 16% of control subjects. the isolation rate was 65% for patients with symptoms for <1 week and for travelers; >1 pathogen was found in 11% of patients. the most frequent enteropathogens were campylobacter (13% of patients), clostridium difficile (13%), enterotoxigenic escherichia coli  (8%), salmonella (7%), shigella (4%), blastocystis hominis (4%), calicivirus (3%), rotavirus (3%), enteroaggregative e. coli (2%), aeromonas (2%), giardia intestinalis (2%), cryptosporidium (2%), and astrovirus (2%). less frequently isolated (< or =1% of patients) were verotoxigenic e. coli, enteropathogenic e. coli, enteroinvasive e. coli, entamoeba histolytica/entamoeba dispar, microsporidia, and adenovirus. fifty percent of the patients were hospitalized, and 43% needed intravenous fluids. the median duration of diarrhea was 14 days. clinical features were not helpful for predicting the etiology of diarrhea.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a difluoro-quinolone.
AB  == lomefloxacin is a new difluoro-quinolone. in this study, we have determined the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared it with that of other fluoro-quinolones and some unrelated  antimicrobials. lomefloxacin was very active against enterobacteriaceae (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) with activity comparable to that of ofloxacin (mic90, 0.25 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was moderately active against isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), and again the activity was comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml) but was eightfold less than ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was also active against isolates of staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 1 micrograms/ml), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, and this activity was most comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was fourfold less active than either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin against isolates of enterococcus faecalis (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml) and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). in common with ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin was very active against isolates of neisseria spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), haemophilus spp. (mic90, less  than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), legionella spp. (mic90, less than or equal  to 0.06 micrograms/ml), vibrio spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), and campylobacter jejuni (mic90, 1 microgram/ml). lomefloxacin showed poor activity against isolates of bacteroides spp. (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml) or clostridium difficile mic90, 32 micrograms/ml) and was only moderately active against isolates of clostridium perfringens (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), peptostreptococcus spp. (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), chlamydia trachomatis (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), mycoplasma hominis (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), and urea-plasma urealyticum (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was found to be bactericidal at concentrations generally close to the mic with greater than 3 log10 reduction in viability of exponentially dividing cultures of escherichia coli and s. aureus within 5 hr of exposure to concentrations at eight times the mic. these results indicate a potential clinical role for lomefloxacin in the treatment of genitourinary tract infections caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respiratory tract infections  caused by susceptible organisms, and soft tissue infections caused by s. aureus.
