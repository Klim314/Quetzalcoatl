TI  == salivary pellicle composition and multispecies biofilm developed on titanium nitrided by cold plasma.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the salivary  pellicle (sp) and multispecies biofilm developed on titanium nitrided by cold plasma. methods: titanium discs were allocated into a control group (ti) and an experimental group (tin - titanium-nitrided by cold plasma). the disc surface topography was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (sem) and atomic force microscopy (afm). the chemical composition of the disc surface was determined by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (xps). stimulated, clarified, and  filtered saliva was used to form pellicles on the discs. proteome analysis of the adsorbed sp proteins was performed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (lc-ms). the surface free energy (sfe) was evaluated before and after sp formation. a multispecies biofilm composed of actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans, fusobacterium nucleatum, veillonella  dispar, and candida albicans was developed on the sp-coated discs. viable microorganism counts were determined. the biomass and average thickness of biofilms were analyzed by confocal laser-scanning microscopy (clsm) with comstat  software. the biofilm organization was visualized by sem. results: the surface topography was similar in both groups. the sfe of the tin group did not differ from that of the ti group (p>0.05), although the adsorption of pellicle proteins  increased the sfe in both pellicle-coated groups (p<0.001). different proteins were identified on the ti and tin surfaces. the amount of biofilm was similar for both groups (p=0.416), but the counts of f. nucleatum and s. oralis were higher in the tin group (p<0.001). similar biofilms were characterized by the comstat data, clsm images, and sem images. conclusion: the titanium nitrided by cold plasma exhibited differences in sp composition and multispecies microbial biofilm population compared to the control titanium surface.

TI  == microbiological diversity of peri-implantitis biofilm by sanger sequencing.
AB  == background and objective: to examine the microbial diversity associated with implants with or without peri-implantitis and to identify differences between the bacterial communities in these clinical conditions. material and methods: twenty  subjects were assigned to a control group consisting of subjects with healthy implants and a test group consisting of subjects with peri-implantitis sites, as  well as a healthy implant site (n = 10/group). in the test group, subgingival biofilm samples were taken from the deepest sites of the diseased implant. in both groups, samples were collected from one site around a healthy implant. dna was extracted and the 16s rrna gene was amplified and sequenced, and the phylotypes were identified by comparison with known 16s rrna sequences. results:  the phylogenetic identity of 1387 16s rrna gene clones was determined. healthy implants demonstrated higher proportions of actinomyces, atopobium, gemella, kingella and rothia and lower levels of campylobacter, desulfobulbus, dialister,  eubacterium, filifactor, mitsukella, porphyromonas and pseudoramibacter (mann-whitney u-test; p < 0.05). fusobacterium nucleatum, dialister invisus, streptococcus sp. human oral taxon (hot) 064, filifactor alocis and mitsuokella sp. hot 131 presented a higher mean proportion, while veillonella dispar, actinomyces meyeri, granulicatella adiacens showed lower mean proportions in the  peri-implantitis sites when compared with healthy implants in both the control and test groups (mann-whitney u-test; p < 0.05). conclusion: marked differences were observed in the composition of the subgingival biofilm between healthy and diseased implants. the biofilm associated with peri-implantitis harbored more pathogenic bacterial species from the orange complex and other "unusual" putative pathogens, such as f. alocis, d. invisus and mitsuokella sp. hot 131.

TI  == identification of veillonella tobetsuensis in tongue biofilm by using a species-specific primer pair.
AB  == veillonella atypica, veillonella denticariosi, veillonella dispar, veillonella parvula, and veillonella rogosae have been reported to be isolated from human oral cavities. the recently detected veillonellatobetsuensis in human tongue biofilms was proposed as a novel veillonella sp. in this study, to determine the  distribution and frequency of v. tobetsuensis, we established a method for the detection and identification of v. tobetsuensis by using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using a species-specific primer pair. the primer pair for v. tobetsuensis was designed on the basis of the nucleotide sequence of the 70-kda heat shock protein (dnak) gene of v. tobetsuensis jcm 17976(t) (=atcc baa-2400(t)). the primer pair generated a specific pcr product for v. tobetsuensis but not for other oral veillonella spp. with the pcr procedure using the primer pair, we could detect less than 10 ng of genomic dna extracted from v. tobetsuensis. thus, the pcr method using this primer pair is suitable for the specific detection and identification of v. tobetsuensis. the distribution and frequency of v. tobetsuensis were investigated by pcr using this species-specific primer pair. v. tobetsuensis was detected in 5 of 27 subjects. v. tobetsuensis was recovered from 19% (5/27) of subjects with other veillonella species. and, prevalence of v. tobetsuensis ranged from 7.6% to 20.0% in these subjects. v. tobetsuensis is likely to coexist with other veillonella spp. in tongue biofilm.  in this study, the species-specific pcr primer pair for v. tobetsuensis was designed using partial sequences of the dnak gene. this is the first report using a species-specific primer pair for pcr to determine the distribution and frequency of v. tobetsuensis in tongue biofilm.

TI  == molecular analysis of bacteria in asymptomatic and symptomatic endodontic infections.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to use terminal restriction fragment length  polymorphism analysis and the 16s rrna gene clone library to investigate the diversity of the microbiota associated with asymptomatic and symptomatic endodontic infections and to compare the bacterial community structure in these two clinical conditions. samples were taken from asymptomatic endodontic infections associated with chronic periradicular lesions and from symptomatic infections clinically diagnosed as acute abscesses. 16s rrna genes from dna isolated from clinical samples were used to construct clone libraries or were subjected to terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. sequence analysis of 186 clones revealed 42 taxa; 23 (55%) were uncultivated phylotypes, of which seven were unique to endodontic infections. clone sequencing and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis revealed that the most commonly detected taxa were fusobacterium nucleatum (including terminal restriction fragment types 1 and 2), peptostreptococcus micros/peptostreptococcus sp. oral clone aj062/bs044/fg014, prevotella species, dialister species, mogibacterium species, lachnospiraceae oral clone 55a-34, filifactor alocis, megasphaera sp. oral clone cs025/bs073, and veillonella sp. oral clone bp1-85/veillonella dispar/v. parvula. bacteroides-like sp. oral clone x083/bacteroidales oral clone mce7_20 and dialister sp. oral clone bs016/mce7_134 were detected only in asymptomatic teeth. on the other hand, f. nucleatum terminal restriction fragment type 2, prevotella intermedia, dialister pneumosintes, and some phylotypes were exclusively detected in symptomatic samples. bacterial profiles of symptomatic endodontic infections generated by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis were clearly different from those of asymptomatic infections. overall, the average number of terminal restriction fragments in symptomatic samples was significantly larger than in asymptomatic samples. molecular analysis of the microbiota associated with symptomatic or asymptomatic endodontic infections indicates that the endodontic bacterial diversity is greater than previously described by culture methods and that the structure of the microbiota differ significantly between asymptomatic and symptomatic infections.

TI  == molecular identification of the first human isolate belonging to the veillonella  ratti-veillonella criceti group based on 16s rdna and dnak gene sequencing.
AB  == anaerobic gram-negative cocci belonging to the genus veillonella are currently subdivided into eight species. among them, four have been isolated either from human flora or from clinical samples during infectious processes: veillonella atypica, v. dispar, v. parvula and v. montpellierensis. to date, the four other species have only been found in animals. in particular, v. ratti and v. criceti,  since their characterization, have been exclusively reported from mouth and intestine of rodents. we report here for the first time a human isolate belonging to the v. ratti-v. criceti group recovered in mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora from  a semen sample in a 24-year-old man attending the urology unit of our hospital for infertility. identification of the isolate was based on 16s ribosomal dna and dnak gene sequencing. since then, two strains of veillonella sp. recovered from semen samples remained unidentified to the species level, and 16s rdna-based phylogenetic analysis revealed that they might represent novel taxa within the genus veillonella. taken together, these observations suggest that host restriction may not exist in the genus veillonella and that bacterial diversity remains underestimated both within this genus and in human semen.

TI  == effects of a chlorhexidine gluconate-containing mouthwash on the vitality and antimicrobial susceptibility of in vitro oral bacterial ecosystems.
AB  == oral bacterial microcosms, established using saliva inocula from three individuals, were maintained under a feast-famine regime within constant-depth film fermenters. steady-state communities were exposed four times daily, postfeeding, to a chlorhexidine (chx) gluconate-containing mouthwash (chxm) diluted to 0.06% (wt/vol) antimicrobial content. the microcosms were characterized by heterotrophic plate counts and pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). chxm caused significant decreases in both total anaerobe  and total aerobe/facultative anaerobe counts (p < 0.05), together with lesser decreases in gram-negative anaerobes. the degree of streptococcal and actinomycete inhibition varied considerably among individuals. dgge showed that chxm exposure caused considerable decreases in microbial diversity, including marked reductions in prevotella sp. and selenomonas infelix. pure-culture studies of 10 oral bacteria (eight genera) showed that actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella dispar, prevotella nigrescens, and the streptococci were highly susceptible to chx, while lactobacillus rhamnosus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and neisseria subflava were the least susceptible. determination of the mics of triclosan, chx, erythromycin, penicillin v, vancomycin, and metronidazole for microcosm isolates, before and after 5 days of chxm exposure, showed that chxm exposure altered the distribution of isolates toward those that were less susceptible to chx (p < 0.05). changes in susceptibility distributions for the other test agents were not statistically significant. in conclusion, population changes in plaque microcosms following repeated exposure to chxm represented an inhibition of the most susceptible flora with a clonal expansion of less susceptible species.

TI  == intra-chromosomal heterogeneity between the four 16s rrna gene copies in the genus veillonella: implications for phylogeny and taxonomy.
AB  == among the seven species characterized within the genus veillonella, three (veillonella dispar, veillonella parvula and veillonella atypica) have so far been isolated from human flora and during infectious processes. sequencing and analysis of 16s rdna (rrs) has been described as the best method for identification of veillonella strains at the species level since phenotypic characteristics are unable to differentiate between species. rrs sequencing for the three species isolated from humans showed more than 98 % identity between them. four rrs copies were found in the reference strains and in all the clinical isolates studied. the sequences of each rrs were determined for the clinical strain adv 360.1, and they showed a relatively high level of heterogeneity (1.43  %). in the majority of cases, polymorphic positions corresponded to nucleotides allowing differentiation between the three species isolated from humans. moreover, variability observed between rrs copies was higher than that between 16s rdna sequences of v. parvula and v. dispar. phylogenetic analysis showed that polymorphism between rrs copies affected the position of strain adv 360.1 in the  tree. variable positions occurred in stems and loops belonging to variable and hypervariable regions of the 16s rrna secondary structure but did not change the  overall structure of the 16s rrna. pcr-rflp experiments performed on 27 clinical  isolates of veillonella sp. suggested that inter-rrs heterogeneity occurs widely  among the members of the genus veillonella: these results, together with the lack of phenotypic criteria for species differentiation, give preliminary arguments for unification of v. dispar and v. parvula.
