TI  == kinetic-dependent killing of oral pathogens with nitric oxide.
AB  == nitric oxide (no)-releasing silica nanoparticles were synthesized via the co-condensation of tetramethyl orthosilicate with aminosilanes and subsequent conversion of secondary amines to n-diazeniumdiolate no donors. a series of ~150  nm no-releasing particles with different no totals and release kinetics (i.e., half-lives) were achieved by altering both the identity and mol% composition of the aminosilane precursors. independent of identical 2 h no-release totals, enhanced antibacterial action was observed against the periodontopathogens aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis with extended  no-release kinetics at ph 7.4. negligible bactericidal effect was observed against cariogenic streptococcus mutans at ph 7.4, even when using no-releasing silica particles with greater no-release totals. however, antibacterial activity  was observed against s. mutans at lower ph (6.4). this result was attributed to more rapid proton-initiated decomposition of the n-diazeniumdiolate no donors and greater no-release payloads. the data suggest a differential sensitivity to no between cariogenic and periodontopathogenic bacteria with implications for the future development of no-releasing oral care therapeutics.

TI  == essential oil from berries of lebanese juniperus excelsa m. bieb displays similar antibacterial activity to chlorhexidine but higher cytocompatibility with human oral primary cells.
AB  == chlorhexidine (chx), one of the most effective drugs administered for periodontal treatment, presents collateral effects including toxicity when used for prolonged periods; here, we have evaluated the bactericidal potency and the cytocompatibility of juniperus excelsa m. bieb essential oil (eo) in comparison with 0.05% chx. the eo was extracted from berries by hydrodistillation and components identified by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. bacterial inhibition halo analysis, quantitative cell viability 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulphophenyl)-5-[(phenyl amino) carbonyl]-2h-tetrazolium hydroxide assay (xtt), and colony forming unit (cfu) count were evaluated against the two biofilm formers aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans. finally, cytocompatibility was assessed with human primary gingival fibroblasts (hgf) and mucosal keratinocytes  (hk). the resulting eo was mainly composed of monoterpene hydrocarbons and oxygenated monoterpenes. an inhibition halo test demonstrated that both bacteria  were sensitive to the eo; xtt analysis and cfu counts confirmed that 10-fold-diluted eo determined a statistically significant (p < 0.05) reduction in bacteria count and viability towards both biofilm and planktonic forms in a comparable manner to those obtained with chx. moreover, eo displayed higher cytocompatibility than chx (p < 0.05). in conclusion, eo exhibited bactericidal activity similar to chx, but a superior cytocompatibility, making it a promising  antiseptic alternative to chx.

TI  == synthesis of new carolacton derivatives and their activity against biofilms of oral bacteria.
AB  == carolacton, a secondary metabolite isolated from the extracts of sorangium cellulosum, causes membrane damage and cell death in biofilms of the caries- and  endocarditis-associated bacterium streptococcus mutans. here, we report the total synthesis of several derivatives of carolacton. all new structural modifications  introduced abolished its biological activity, including subtle ones, such as inversion of configuration at c9. however, a bicyclic bislactone derivative as well as the methyl ester of carolacton resulted in compounds with prodrug properties. their inhibitory activity on s. mutans was proven to be based on enzymatic hydrolysis by s. mutans which provided native carolacton resulting in biofilm damage in vivo. moreover, we demonstrate that carolacton acts also on s.  gordonii, s. oralis and the periodontitis pathogen aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, causing elongated cells and growth inhibition.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of chemokine cxcl10 for dermal and oral microorganisms.
AB  == cxcl10 (ip-10) is a small 10 kda chemokine with antimicrobial activity. it is induced by ifn-gamma, chemoattracts mononuclear cells, and promotes adhesion of t cells. recently, we detected cxcl10 on the surface of the skin and in the oral cavity. in the current study, we used broth microdilution and radial diffusion assays to show that cxcl10 inhibits the growth of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, corynebacterium jeikeium, corynebacterium striatum, and candida albicans hmv4c, but not corynebacterium bovis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, poryphromonas gingivalis, or c. albicans atcc 64124. the reason for the selective antimicrobial activity is not yet known. however, antimicrobial activity of cxcl10 may be related to its composition and structure, as a cationic 98 amino acid residue molecule with 10 lysine residues,  7 arginine residues, a total net charge of +11, and a theoretical pi of 9.93. modeling studies revealed that cxcl10 contains an alpha-helix at the n-terminal,  three anti-parallel beta-strands in the middle, and an alpha-helix at the c-terminal. thus, cxcl10, when produced on the surface of the skin or in the oral cavity, likely has antimicrobial activity and may enhance innate antimicrobial and cellular responses to the presence of select commensal or opportunistic microorganisms.

TI  == anaerobic culture to detect periodontal and caries pathogens.
AB  == background: anaerobic culture has been critical in our understanding of the oral  microbiotas. highlight: studies in advanced periodontitis in the 1970's revealed  microbial complexes that associated with different clinical presentations. taxonomy studies identified species newly-observed in periodontitis as aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter (wolinella) rectus and other campylobacter species, and tannerella (bacteroides) forsythia. anaerobic culture of initial periodontitis showed overlap in the microbiota with  gingivitis, and added selenomonas noxia and filifactor alocis as putative periodontal pathogens. porphyromonas gingivalis and t. forsythia were found to be associated with initial periodontitis in adults. the dominant microbiota of dental caries differs from that of periodontitis. the major cariogenic species are acidogenic and acid tolerant species particularly streptococcus mutans, and lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species. anaerobic culture of severe early childhood caries revealed a widely diverse microbiota, comparable to that observed using cloning and sequencing. the pcr-based cloning approach, however, underestimated actinobacteria compared with culture. only a subset of the caries-associated microbiota was acid tolerant, with different segments of the microbiota cultured on blood agar compared to a low ph acid agar. while the major caries-associated species was s. mutans, a new species, scardovia wiggsiae, was significantly associated with early childhood caries. higher counts of s. wiggsiae were also observed in initial white spot carious lesions in adolescents. conclusion: in periodontitis and dental caries, anaerobic culture studies of advanced disease provided a comprehensive analysis of the microbiota of these infections. anaerobic culture highlighted the limitation of pcr with standard primers that underestimate detection of actinobacteria.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of synthetic antimicrobial decapeptide against oral bacteria].
AB  == objective: this study aims to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of decapeptide, a novel antimicrobial peptide, against several major cariogenic and periodontopathogenic bacteria in vitro. methods in this study, we investigated the antimicrobial activity of decapeptide against streptococcus mutans (s. mutans), streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and saccharomyces albicans in vitro using the agar diffusion method and broth dilution method. furthermore, a time-kill kinetic study of decapeptide against s. mutans was performed. results: the results showed that decapeptide exhibited antimicrobial activity against various  oral bacteria and fungi. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of main cariogenic bacteria ranged from 62.5 mug . ml(-1) to 125 mug . ml(-1), and the mic of periodontopathogenic bacteria tested ranged from 250 mug . ml(-1) to 1,000 mug . ml(-1). among the bacteria tested, decapeptide had a strong inhibitory effect on cariogenic s. mutans. results of the time-kill kinetic studies showed that decapeptide reduced the viable counts of s. mutans by more than one order of magnitude after 20 min of incubation, and thoroughly killed s. mutans after 30 min. no viable cells could be detected after 24 h of incubation. conclusion: this study suggest that decapeptide might have potential clinical application in treating dental caries by killing s. mutans within dental plaque.

TI  == bactericidal activity and mechanism of photoirradiated polyphenols against gram-positive and -negative bacteria.
AB  == the bactericidal effect of various types of photoirradiated polyphenols against gram-positive and -negative bacteria was evaluated in relation to the mode of action. gram-positive bacteria (enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus mutans) and gram-negative bacteria (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) suspended in a 1 mg/ml polyphenol aqueous solution (caffeic acid, gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin gallate, and proanthocyanidin) were exposed to led light (wavelength, 400 nm; irradiance, 260 mw/cm2) for 5 or 10 min. caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid exerted the highest bactericidal activity  followed by gallic acid and proanthocyanidin against both gram-positive and -negative bacteria. it was also demonstrated that the disinfection treatment induced oxidative damage of bacterial dna, which suggests that polyphenols are incorporated into bacterial cells. the present study suggests that blue light irradiation of polyphenols could be a novel disinfection treatment.

TI  == effects of adjunctive daily phototherapy on chronic periodontitis: a randomized single-blind controlled trial.
AB  == purpose: the purpose of this randomized single-blind controlled trial was to elucidate the clinical and antimicrobial effects of daily phototherapy (pt) as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (srp) in patients with chronic periodontitis. methods: the study was conducted from december 2013 to may 2014 at ewha womans university mokdong hospital, seoul, korea. forty-one patients with mild to moderate chronic periodontitis were randomly divided into two therapeutic groups  in a 1:1 ratio: srp+pt and srp (control) groups. all participants underwent full-mouth srp. pt was performed thrice a day for a month by using electric toothbrushes with embedded light-emitting diodes. plaque index, gingival index, probing pocket depth (ppd), clinical attachment level (cal), and bleeding on probing were assessed before (baseline) and four weeks after (follow-up) the treatment. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sobrinus levels were detected by a real-time polymerase chain reaction at the same points in time. results: the clinical parameters improved in both the groups. at the follow-up assessment, ppd was significantly decreased in the srp+pt group (p=0.00). further, ppd and cal showed significantly greater changes in the srp+pt group than in the srp group (ppd, p=0.03; cal, p=0.04). p. gingivalis and t. forsythia levels decreased in this group, but no significant intergroup differences were noted. conclusions: adjunctive pt seems to have clinical benefits, but evidence of its antimicrobial  effects is not sufficient. long-term studies are necessary to develop the most effective pt protocol and compare the effectiveness of pt with and without exogenous photosensitizers.

TI  == integration of non-oral bacteria into in vitro oral biofilms.
AB  == biofilms are polymicrobial communities that grow on surfaces in nature. oral bacteria can spontaneously form biofilms on the surface of teeth, which may compromise the health of the teeth, or their surrounding (periodontal) tissues. while the oral bacteria exhibit high tropism for their specialized ecological niche, it is not clear if bacteria that are not part of the normal oral microbiota can efficiently colonize and grow within oral biofilms. by using an in vitro "supragingival" biofilm model of 6 oral species, this study aimed to investigate if 3 individual bacterial species that are not part of the normal oral microbiota (eschericia coli, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecails) and one not previously tested oral species (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) can be incorporated into this established supragingival biofilm model. staphylococcus aureus and a. actinomycetemcomitans were able to grow efficiently in the biofilm, without disrupting the growth of the remaining species. they localized in sparse small aggregates within the biofilm mass. enterococcus faecalis and e. coli were both able to populate the biofilm at high  numbers, and suppressed the growth of a. oris and s. mutants. enterococcus faecalis was arranged in a chain-like conformation, whereas e. coli was densely and evenly spread throughout the biofilm mass. in conclusion, it is possible for  selected species that are not part of the normal oral microbiota to be introduced into an oral biofilm, under the given experimental micro-environmental conditions. moreover, the equilibrated incorporation of a. actinomycetemcomitans  and s. aureus in this oral biofilm model could be a useful tool in the study of aggressive periodontitis and peri-implantitis, in which these organisms are involved, respectively.

TI  == low levels of caries in aggressive periodontitis: a literature review.
AB  == this article is a traditional literature review on caries levels in aggressive periodontitis. aggressive periodontitis generally affects systemically healthy individuals aged <30 years (older individuals can also be affected) and is characterized by a young age of onset, rapid rate of disease progression, and familial aggregation of cases. dental caries is caused by the dissolution of enamel by acid-producing bacteria present in the plaque biofilm, especially when  the biofilm reaches critical mass due to improper oral hygiene. the association between caries level and aggressive periodontitis has long been debated. initial  research indicated that caries levels were high in patients with aggressive periodontitis, but high-quality studies have consistently shown that caries and aggressive periodontitis are inversely related. a recent in vitro study showed that streptococcus mutans was killed more readily in the saliva of patients with  aggressive periodontitis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans positivity than in patients with a. actinomycetemcomitans negativity. other mechanisms possibly explaining the inverse relationship between caries and aggressive periodontitis in cases of down's syndrome are also discussed in this literature review. the usefulness of caries level in the diagnosis of aggressive periodontitis in developing countries such as india, where the disease is diagnosed primarily on the basis of clinical and radiographic features and familial history is also discussed.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of antibacterial efficacy of pineapple extract (bromelain) on periodontal pathogens.
AB  == background: periodontitis is an inflammatory disease resulting in the destruction of periodontal tissues. various treatment modalities have been tried in the form  of mechanical therapy and surgical therapy. antimicrobial agents have been used as a monotherapy and as an adjunct with mechanical debridement. various plant extracts have been used as antibacterial agents. pineapple extract (bromelian) is one such agent. hence this study was conducted to assess the antibacterial efficacy of bromelain on both aerobic and anaerobic periodontal microorganisms. the aim was to assess the antibacterial efficacy of bromelain on both aerobic and anaerobic periodontal microorganisms. materials and methods: minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of bromelain was tested on isolated strains of streptococcus  mutans, enterococcus fecalis aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), and porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) using serial dilution broth method. results: s. mutans showed sensitivity at the lowest concentration of 2 mg/ml as compared to e fecalis (31.25 mg/ml) while pgingivalis showed sensitivity at the lowest concentration of 4.15 mg/ml as compared to aa (16.6 mg/ml). conclusion: bromelain exerts an antibacterial effect against potent periodontal pathogens; hence, it may be used as an antibacterial agent. however, further trial has to be conducted to validate this result.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of lemongrass oil against oral malodour micro-organisms and  the pilot study of safety and efficacy of lemongrass mouthrinse on oral malodour.
AB  == aims: lemongrass oil (lg) has been reported as being effective against bacteria embedded within the biofilm. the aims of this study were to investigate antimicrobial activity against common odourigenic micro-organisms, the safety and efficacy of lg mouthrinse on oral malodour in healthy volunteers. methods and results: antimicrobial activity of lg mouthrinse was examined against common odourigenic micro-organisms using broth microdilution assay and the disc diffusion method. a randomised double-blind clinical study was performed in 20 healthy volunteers. volatile sulphur compounds (vscs) level was measured using a  halimeter on day 0 and day 8 in each volunteer. the results showed that lg mouthrinse was effective against aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans atcc43718  and porphyromonas gingivalis w50 but less effective against streptococcus mutans  atcc 25175. in addition, the mouthrinse significantly reduced vscs on day 8. conclusions: lg mouthrinse was able to reduce oral malodour and appeared to be safe. the overall satisfaction of the mouthrinse was acceptable. however, the spiciness and taste of the mouthrinse need to be improved. significance and impact of the study: this study demonstrated that the lg mouthrinse significantly reduced oral malodour. this mouthrinse would be another alternative mouthrinse choice for prevention of malodour, plaque and gingivitis.

TI  == the presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavity of one-year-old infants delivered pre-term with very low birthweights: a case control study.
AB  == background: recently, the dental literature has focused mainly on the microbial colonization of healthy full-term infants and their mothers or caretakers. however, oral microbial acquisition by premature infants has not been adequately  investigated, and the correlation between pre-term birth and the presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens has not been determined. the aim of this study was to identify the presence and quantities of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavities of 12-month-old infants and compare the occurrence of these microbes between a cohort of pre-term infants with very low birthweights and a control cohort comprising full-term infants. methods: the research cohort was composed of 69 one-year-old infants, of whom 24  were born prematurely with very low birthweights and 45 of whom were carried to full term. information regarding the infants' gestational age, mode of delivery,  general health status, birthweight and antibiotic use were obtained from hospital records and through oral interviews. at 12 months of age, both groups of infants  were examined, and unstimulated saliva samples from the dorsum of the tongue and  dental plaque samples were collected. the microorganisms (streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus spp., actinomyces spp., aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum) were identified and their quantities were evaluated using a pcr-based method. the chi-squared and fisher's factorial tests were used for the statistical evaluations. results: the infants had a high prevalence of cariogenic microbes and of fusosbacterium nucleatum and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. cariogenic microbes were detected in 91.7% of the very low birthweight infants and in all full-term infants. periodontal pathogens were present in 83% of the pre-term infants and in 96% of the full-term infants. a significant difference was found between the cohorts in terms of the presence of s. mutans. most of the  very low birthweight infants had negative values of this microbe, while the full-term infants had positive values. conclusions: this study confirms the early transmission of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens to the oral cavity of one-year-old infants and a higher prevalence of s. mutans in full-term  infants than in premature infants.

TI  == nanoparticle-encapsulated chlorhexidine against oral bacterial biofilms.
AB  == background: chlorhexidine (chx) is a widely used antimicrobial agent in dentistry. herein, we report the synthesis of a novel mesoporous silica nanoparticle-encapsulated pure chx (nano-chx), and its mechanical profile and antimicrobial properties against oral biofilms. methodology/principal findings: the release of chx from the nano-chx was characterized by uv/visible absorption spectroscopy. the antimicrobial properties of nano-chx were evaluated in both planktonic and biofilm modes of representative oral pathogenic bacteria. the nano-chx demonstrated potent antibacterial effects on planktonic bacteria and mono-species biofilms at the concentrations of 50-200 microg/ml against streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and enterococccus faecalis. moreover, nano-chx effectively suppressed multi-species biofilms such as s. mutans, f. nucleatum, a. actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis up to 72 h. conclusions/significance: this pioneering study demonstrates the potent antibacterial effects of the nano-chx on oral biofilms, and it may be developed as a novel and promising anti-biofilm agent for clinical use.

TI  == antibacterial efficacy of exogenous nitric oxide on periodontal pathogens.
AB  == current treatments for periodontitis (e.g., scaling/root planing and chlorhexidine) have limited efficacy since they fail to suppress microbial biofilms satisfactorily over time, and the use of adjunctive antimicrobials can promote the emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms. herein, we report the novel application of nitric oxide (no)-releasing scaffolds (i.e., dendrimers and  silica particles) as anti-periodontopathogenic agents. the effectiveness of macromolecular no release was demonstrated by a 3-log reduction in periodontopathogenic aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis viability. in contrast, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguinis, caries-associated organisms, were substantially less sensitive to no treatment. both dendrimer- and silica-based no release exhibited substantially less toxicity to human gingival fibroblasts at concentrations necessary to eradicate periodontopathogens than did clinical concentrations of chlorhexidine.  these results suggest the potential utility of macromolecular no-release scaffolds as a novel platform for the development of periodontal disease therapeutics.

TI  == evaluation of a new oral health scale of infectious potential based on the salivary microbiota.
AB  == objectives: the objective of this study is to analyse the correlation of our own  design of oral health scale (grades 0 and 1-better oral health vs. grades 2 and 3-poorer oral health) with the salivary microbiota. patients and methods: the oral health scale we elaborated was evaluated in 100 adults (25 patients from each global oral health grade). saliva samples collected from these patients were analysed using microbiological culture techniques, determining the presence/absence and the concentrations of some odontopathogens and periodontopathogens. results: in comparison with the global oral health grades 0-1, the grades 2-3 presented significantly higher values for the presence of odontopathogens (78 vs. 38 %; streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus spp. and actinomyces spp.) and periodontopathogens (100 vs. 90 %; aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter spp., fusobacterium spp. and prevotella gingivalis). in comparison with the grades 0-1, the grades 2-3 presented significantly higher values for the concentrations (cfu/ml log10) of facultative  anaerobes, strict anaerobes, odontopathogens (s. mutans, lactobacillus spp. and actinomyces spp.) and periodontopathogens (a. actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga spp., campylobacter spp. and fusobacterium spp.). conclusion: our  new global oral health scale shows a positive correlation with the detection and  quantification of certain odontopathogens and periodontopathogens present in the  saliva, confirming their possible infectious potential. clinical relevance: our own design of oral health scale could be particularly useful for the epidemiological study of different populations, the evaluation of the influence of oral health on the development of certain systemic diseases as well as the analysis of inter- and intra-individual variability of the oral microbiota in relation to the different grades of the oral health scale.

TI  == inhibitory activity of myrtus communis oil on some clinically isolated oral pathogens.
AB  == objectives: to determine the antimicrobial activities of myrtus communis oil (mco) on some oral pathogens. material and methods: thirty strains of streptococcus mutans, aggregatibacteractinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and 20 strains of streptococcus pyogenes and candida albicans isolated from patients with dental caries, periodontal diseases, pharyngitis and oral lesions associated with artificial dentures were used for the antimicrobial activity of mco. the oil was prepared by hydrodistillation procedures using a clevenger apparatus. agar disk diffusion and broth microdilution methods were performed on various concentrations of mco (3.9-1,000 microg/ml) using all the pathogens isolated. results: all isolates were sensitive to mco at 125-1,000 microg/ml by agar disk diffusion producing inhibition zones of 8.1-41.25 mm in diameter. all of the s. pyogenes, s. mutans and c. albicans strains were sensitive to 62.5 microg/ml while 70% (21/30) of a. actinomycetemcomitans and 66.6% (20/30) of p. gingivalis were resistant to these concentrations. all s. pyogenes and s. mutans strains were sensitive to 31.25 microg/ml. all s. pyogenes strains were sensitive to 15.6 and 7.8 microg/ml of mco. none of the clinical isolates in this study were sensitive to 3.9 microg/ml or to a lower concentration of oil. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of mco for s. pyogenes, s. mutans, c. albicans, a.actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were  29.68 +/- 4.8, 31.25 +/- 0, 46.9 +/- 16, 62.5 +/- 0 and 62.5 +/- 0 microg/ml, respectively. conclusions: data obtained in this study revealed a strong antimicrobial activity of mco on the tested oral pathogens, and mco could therefore be useful in the prevention of the related oral infections.

TI  == improving photodynamic inactivation of bacteria in dentistry: highly effective and fast killing of oral key pathogens with novel tooth-colored type-ii photosensitizers.
AB  == increasing antibiotic resistances in microorganisms create serious problems in public health. this demands alternative approaches for killing pathogens to supplement standard treatment methods. photodynamic inactivation of bacteria (pib) uses light activated photosensitizers (ps) to generate reactive oxygen species immediately upon illumination, inducing lethal phototoxicity. positively  charged phenalen-1-one derivatives are a new generation of ps for light-mediated  killing of pathogens with outstanding singlet oxygen quantum yield phidelta of >97%. upon irradiation with a standard photopolymerizer light (bluephase c8, 1260 +/- 50 mw/cm(2)) the ps showed high activity against the oral key pathogens enterococcus faecalis, actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus mutans, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. at a concentration of 10 mum, a maximum efficacy of more than 6 log10 steps (>/= 99.9999%) of bacteria killing is reached in less than 1 min (light dose 50 j/cm(2)) after one single treatment. the pyridinium substituent as positively charged moiety is especially advantageous for antimicrobial action.

TI  == antibacterial action of chlorhexidine/thymol containing varnishes in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == objectives: the antibacterial activity of two different formulations of a chlorhexidine/thymol varnish should be elucidated in vitro and in vivo. methods:  the agar diffusion assay with cervitec((r)) and cervitecplus((r)) and three reference strains each of streptococci, lactobacilli, actinomyces and periodontal pathogens was performed. in a split-mouth study, 40 volunteers applied the test (cervitecplus((r)), solvent water and ethanol) and control (cervitec((r)), solvent ethyl acetate) varnish at buccal recessions of premolar teeth at baseline as well as after two, four and seven days. supra- and subgingival plaques were collected 2 weeks before baseline and at the screening appointments. supragingival plaque was analysed for mutans streptococci and lactobacilli and subgingival samples for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis and porphyromonas intermedia. friedman/wilcoxon tests and u-test were used for statistical analysis (p < 0.05). results: most reference strains were susceptible with inhibition zones (mm) as follows: cervitec((r))/cervitecplus((r)) streptococci 27 +/- 1.7/21.3 +/- 2.5, lactobacilli 26 +/- 9.2/23.7 +/- 4.9, actinomyces 36.3 +/- 6.6/27.3 +/- 1.5, periodontal pathogens 18.7 +/- 7.6/18 +/- 1.7. both varnishes reduced significantly the counts of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in the patients. however, no significant differences were found between test and control sides at  any time. the total counts of periodontal pathogens were low. a tendency to higher counts of a. actinomycetemcomitans at the control side could be shown; the test side did not harbour significantly higher counts. conclusion: both varnishes may influence the plaque formation and reduce mutans streptococci in supragingival plaque.

TI  == cyclodextrin modulates the cytotoxic effects of chlorhexidine on microrganisms and cells in vitro.
AB  == although several studies have shown that chlorhexidine (cx) has bactericidal activity and exerts toxic effects on periodontal tissues a few studies evaluated  mechanisms to reduce its adverse effects maintaining the antimicrobial properties. therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the in vitro antimicrobial activity and cellular cytotoxicity of cx included on cyclodextrins (cd), alpha, beta or hp-beta-cyclodextrins (hp-beta-cd). the influence of cds was determined by increasing its molar rate 1:1 to 1:4 in relation with free cx. the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) for candida albicans, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans actinomycemcomitans and streptococcus mutans were determined. an ergosterol solubilization assay was carried out using the c. albicans model and osteoblasts, fibroblasts and tumoral  caco-2 cells for cytotoxicity assay. the antimicrobial activity results in a significant growth inhibition of c. albicans when it was treated with cx:alpha-cd complexes, whereas cx:beta-cd was more effective for a. actinomycetemcomitans, and cx:hp-beta-cd complexes was for s. mutans when compared to the other complexes. the cytotoxicity for fibroblasts and osteoblasts decreased in relation with each kind of cd been beta-cd </= hp-beta-cd </= alpha-cd. although the hp-beta-cd inclusion complexes had more severe effects on caco-2 cells, all complexes exhibited less cytotoxicity than free cx. the alpha-cd, beta-cd and hp-beta-cd increase the antimicrobial activity of cx, but decrease its cytotoxic  effects on mammalian cells. taken together these findings suggest that cyclodextrins are a tool for modulation of effects of cx. it could be useful to design cx/cd delivery systems with high efficacy and minimum cytotoxic effects.

AB  == background and objective: the increasing resistance of oral pathogens against antibiotic measures urgently requires new therapeutic strategies. in this context, antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (apdt) may play a crucial part in the future. the aim of the present study was to compare the antibacterial efficiency  of apdt using the photosensitizer safranine o with that of chlorhexidine (0.2% chx) on an ex vivo biofilm. methods: first the antibacterial activity of both measures against planktonic cultures of streptococcus gordonii atcc 33399, streptococcus mutans atcc 25175, fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 10953, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans atcc 33384 and porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277 was observed. then a patient specific ex vivo biofilm was established  from plaque and saliva samples of patients (n = 19) with chronic periodontitis. the antibacterial effects of apdt and of 0.2% chx were determined on the ex vivo  biofilms cultivated for 24 and 72 hours. after cultivation of the treated samples on blood agar (2 days) the results were quantified by counting the colony forming units (cfu/ml). results: photodynamic treatment with safranine o showed a distinct antibacterial effect on f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis. whereas s. gordonii was suppressed completely by apdt, treatment with 0.2% chx caused only a partial reduction. in the ex vivo biofilm model (24-hour biofilm), apdt caused a  significantly higher bacterial killing than treatment with 0.2% chx. compared to  the untreated control, there was no significant difference on the 72-hour biofilm for both methods. conclusions: the results show that oral-pathogenic species in planktonic solution can be suppressed significantly by apdt with safranine o. especially for bacteria in a 24-hour ex vivo biofilm, this method is more effective than treatment with 0.2% chx. both antibacterial treatments did not show any significant effect on the biofilm cultivated for 72 hours.

TI  == comparison of the penetration and passage of streptococcus mutans and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans through membranes loaded with tetracycline, amoxicillin, and chlorhexidine: an in vitro study.
AB  == background: this study aimed at comparing the colonization and passage of streptococcus mutans and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) through polytetrafluoroethylene (ptfe) and acellular dermal matrix (adm) membranes loaded with tetracycline, amoxicillin, and chlorhexidine. methods: in this in vitro study, ptfe and adm membranes were loaded with tetracycline, amoxicillin, and chlorhexidine. the colonization and crossing of s. mutans and aa through these membranes were evaluated using vials containing culture medium. three-way analysis of variance and tukey's honestly significant difference test were used for the statistical analyses (p<0.05). results: the membranes loaded with antimicrobial agents significantly decreased bacterial passage compared with the  control membranes (not loaded with antimicrobial agents). significant differences were also detected between membranes in their inhibitory properties (p=0.011). ptfe membrane had higher barrier effect than adm. tetracycline had greater antibacterial activity against both species compared with amoxicillin (p=0.021) but had no significant difference with chlorhexidine in this respect (p=0.068). the antimicrobial efficacy of chlorhexidine was in between those of tetracycline  and amoxicillin, but the difference between amoxicillin and chlorhexidine in this respect was not statistically significant (p=0.992). aa had better penetration into the membranes compared with s. mutans. conclusions: the study results demonstrated that the penetration of s. mutans and aa decreased into the membranes loaded with tetracycline, amoxicillin, and chlorhexidine and ptfe membrane had a greater barrier effect than adm. loading membranes with antimicrobial agents can effectively reduce membrane-associated infections during regenerative procedures.

TI  == dental caries and microbiota in children with black stain and non-discoloured dental plaque.
AB  == aim: we aimed to assess caries experience and microbiota in systemically healthy  children with black stain (bs) and non-discoloured plaque. methods: forty-six children with bs and 47 counterparts with non-discoloured plaque aged 7.9 +/- 1.3 years were clinically examined. dental caries was scored using who criteria. samples of bs and non-discoloured dental plaque were collected from tooth surfaces. the dna of the samples was extracted and real-time pcr was performed to determine the total number of bacteria and the species streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, lactobacillus sp., actinomyces naeslundii, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum. results: children with bs had lower dmft (p = 0.013), lower dt values (p = 0.005) and a tendency to lower caries prevalence (p = 0.061) than children with non-discoloured plaque. plaque samples of the bs group contained higher numbers of a. naeslundii (p = 0.005) and lower numbers of f. nucleatum (p = 0.001) and lactobacillus sp. (p = 0.001) compared to the non-discoloured plaque samples of the control group. comparing the children with  bs and non-discoloured plaque, higher counts for a. naeslundii (p = 0.013) were observed in caries-free children with bs while in caries-affected children with bs, lower counts of f. nucleatum (p = 0.007) were found. counts of lactobacillus  sp. were higher in non-discoloured plaque samples than in bs of caries-free and caries-affected children. conclusion: results suggest that the different microbial composition of bs might be associated with the lower caries experience  in affected subjects. the role of black-pigmented bacteria associated with periodontitis needs further studies.

TI  == antibiogram pattern of oral microflora in periodontic children of age group 6 to  12 years: a clinicomicrobiological study.
AB  == aim: the study was carried out to see the diversity of oral microflora and its antibiotic sensitivity test in children of age group 6 to 12 years was carried. materials and methods: total 50 patients of age group 6 to 12 years were analyzed for their oral microflora and then checked for the antibiotic susceptibility test. the samples that were collected were incubated at 37 degrees c for 48 hours. once dispersed samples were taken and gram staining was done, also they were spread on to a number of freshly prepared agar plates and incubated to allow cells to form microbial colony. results: the result showed microflora common in all types, gram-positive facultative anaerobic rods and cocci. in normal children gram-positive facultative anaerobic and fermenting cocci were predominant where as in children with caries growth of microbiota that were gram-negative and positive, capnophilic, motile and anaerobic rods and cocci belonging to members of genera s. mutans and a. actinomycetemcomitans was seen. conclusion: by the present study it has been concluded that the number of bacteria determined by microscopic counts was twice as high in caries patients as in healthy sites, and  also recommended that amoxicillin, ampicillin and amikacin are the most effective antibacterial drugs for the treatment of dental caries.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection  treatment with photolysis of hydrogen peroxide.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection treatment with photolysis of h2o2 and comparing this with existing antibacterial agents. we tested seven antibacterial agents, including amoxicillin, cefepime hydrochloride, erythromycin, ofloxacin, clindamycin hydrochloride, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, and minocycline hydrochloride, as positive controls for validation of the assay protocol. for all of the agents tested, at least one of the four bacterial species (staphylococcus  aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and streptococcus salivarius) was resistant to these agents by repeated exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of the agents up to 10 times. in contrast, antibacterial activity  against any of the bacterial species tested (s. aureus, e. faecalis, e. coli, s.  salivarius, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus mutans, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) was not affected by repeated exposure to the disinfection  treatment up to 40 times. this finding suggested that the risk of inducing bacterial resistance by disinfection treatment was low. the active ingredient of  this disinfection treatment is hydroxyl radicals generated by photolysis of h2o2. therefore, hydroxyl radicals interact with several cell structures and different  metabolic pathways in microbial cells, probably resulting in a lack of development of bacterial resistance. in conclusion, disinfection treatment with photolysis of h2o2 appears to be a potential alternative for existing antimicrobial agents in terms of a low risk of inducing bacterial resistance.

TI  == does photodynamic therapy enhance standard antibacterial therapy in dentistry?
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to assess whether or not photodynamic therapy enhanced standard antibacterial therapy in dentistry. background data: photodynamic therapy when used as an adjunct to conventional periodontal therapy  kills more bacteria than when conventional periodontal therapy is used alone. materials and methods: to address the focused question, "does photodynamic therapy enhance killing of oral bacteria?" pubmed/medline((r)) and google scholar databases were explored. original human and experimental studies and studies using photodynamic therapy for killing oral bacteria were included. letters to the editor, historic reviews, and unpublished data were excluded. results: photodynamic therapy significantly reduces periodontopathogenic bacteria including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, and porphyromonas gingivalis. photodynamic therapy kills cariogenic bacteria (such as streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis), bacteria associated with infected root canals, and those associated with periimplantitis. conclusions: photodynamic therapy, when used as an adjunct to conventional oral disinfection protocols, enhances standard antibacterial therapy in dentistry.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of isothiocyanates (itcs) extracted from horseradish (armoracia rusticana) root against oral microorganisms.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of isothiocyanates (itcs) extracted from horseradish root was investigated against oral microorganisms: 6 strains of facultative anaerobic bacteria, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus casei, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans; one strain of yeast, candida albicans, and 3 strains of anaerobic bacteria, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella nigrescens, and clostridium perfringens. the itcs extracted from horseradish root showed antimicrobial activity against all oral microorganisms by the paper disk method.  the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of the itcs extracted from horseradish root ranged from 1.25 to 5.00 mg/ml against 6 strains of facultative  anaerobic bacteria and one strain of yeast, and 4.17 to 16.67 mg/ml against 3 strains of anaerobic bacteria. the itcs extracted from horseradish root showed the strongest antimicrobial activity, with a mbc of 1.25 mg/ml, against c. albicans among facultative microorganisms, and 4.17 mg/ml against f. nucleatum among anaerobic bacteria. these results suggest that the itcs extracted from horseradish root may be a candidate for use as an antimicrobial agent against oral microorganisms.

TI  == bacterial adhesion to antibiotic-loaded guided tissue regeneration membranes - a  scanning electron microscopy study.
AB  == background/purpose: bacterial contamination of sites undergoing guided tissue regeneration (gtr) therapy may reduce the efficiency of periodontal regeneration. this study compared bacterial adhesion onto various gtr membranes incorporated with antibiotics. methods: three barrier membranes, including expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (eptfe) membrane, collagen membrane, and glycolide fiber  membrane, were loaded with tetracycline or amoxicillin. the adhesion of streptococcus mutans and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans onto the gtr membranes with or without antibiotics was analyzed using the scanning electron microscopy (sem) analysis. results: the sem analysis showed no apparent alteration in the physical structure of the membranes loaded with antibiotics. both s. mutans and a. actinomycetemcomitans attached best on the collagen membranes, followed by the eptfe membranes, and then the glycolide fiber membranes without antibiotics. moreover, higher numbers of bacteria were observed on the fibril areas than on the laminar areas of the eptfe membranes. the amounts of attached bacteria on the gtr membranes increased after longer incubation. incorporation of tetracycline or amoxicillin greatly reduced the adhesion of s. mutans and a. actinomycetemcomitans onto all of the gtr membranes examined. conclusion: incorporation of tetracycline or amoxicillin greatly reduced adhesion of s. mutans or a. actinomycetemcomitans on the eptfe, glycolide fiber, or collagen membranes. this finding indicates that it is valuable and effective to use the antibiotic-loaded gtr membranes for periodontal regeneration therapy.

TI  == no evidence of triclosan-resistant bacteria following long-term use of triclosan-containing toothpaste.
AB  == background and objective: there is a paucity of data in relation to the possible  emergence of triclosan (tcs)-resistant bacteria following long-term exposure to tcs toothpaste. therefore, this study investigated whether long-term continuous exposure to tcs in toothpaste selects for tcs-resistant bacteria within the oral  biofilm. material and methods: dental plaque samples were collected from 40 individuals during year 5 of a randomised controlled trial. participants had been randomly assigned to use tcs (3000 mug/ml tcs) (n = 18) or placebo toothpaste (n  = 22). diluted plaque samples were plated on to wilkins-chalgren agar plates containing 5% (v/v) laked sheep red blood cells and tcs (concentrations ranging from 25 to 150 mug/ml) and incubated at 37 degrees c under microaerophilic and anaerobic conditions for 2-10 d. selected bacterial isolates were identified by partial 16s rdna sequencing and tcs minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) determined for each isolate. results: at 3000 mug/ml tcs no growth was observed under microaerophilic or anaerobic conditions in either group. the mics of tcs for all isolates ranged from 125 to 1000 mug/ml in both groups. species common to both groups had similar mics. veillonella parvula and campylobacter gracilis were the most frequent isolates from both groups, with similar mics in both groups. conclusion: the use of tcs-containing toothpaste did not appear to lead to an increase in mic of tcs of oral bacterial isolates.

TI  == effect of metalloporphyrins on red autofluorescence from oral bacteria.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess the red autofluorescence from bacterial species related to dental caries and periodontitis in the presence of different nutrients in the growth medium. bacteria were grown anaerobically on tryptic soy  agar (tsa) supplemented with nutrients, including magnesium-porphyrins from spinach and iron-porphyrins from heme. the autofluorescence was then assessed at  405 nm excitation. on the tsa without additives, no autofluorescence was observed from any of the species tested. on the tsa containing sheep blood, red autofluorescence was observed only from parvimonas micra. when the tsa was supplemented with blood, hemin, and vitamin k, red autofluorescence was observed  from actinomyces naeslundii, bifidobacterium dentium, and streptococcus mutans. finally, on the tsa supplemented with spinach extract, red autofluorescence was observed from aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, a. naeslundii, enterococcus  faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus salivarius, s. mutans, and veillonella parvula. we conclude that the bacteria related to dental caries and periodontal disease exhibit red autofluorescence. the autofluorescence characteristics of the tested strains depended on the nutrients present, such as  metalloporphyrins, suggesting that the metabolic products of the oral biofilm could be responsible for red autofluorescence.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial and anticancer potential of hinokitiol against oral pathogens and oral cancer cell lines.
AB  == hinokitiol is a natural component isolated from chamacyparis taiwanensis. it has  anti-microbial activity, and has been used in oral care products. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimal microbicidal concentration (mmc) of hinokitiol against mrsa, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, streptococcus mutans, and candida albicans were determined by the agar and broth dilution method (mic: 40-110mum; mmc: 50-130mum); the paradoxical inhibition phenomenon (pip) was observed in a. actinomycetemcomitans and s. mutans. the pip can be described as microbial growth occurring in the presence of both high and low concentrations of a compound, between which microbial growth is inhibited. the pip was confirmed using a kinetic microplate and inhibition zone methods. the pip was also observed in mrsa. the low autolysin activity somehow correlated to the pip positive. the cell diameter was increased in all the pathogens, and the transition was inhibited in c. albicans following hinokitiol treatment. hinokitiol is also a potential anticancer drug. the 200mum of hinokitiol has significant antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities against oral pathogens and oral squamous cell carcinoma cell lines, respectively, and lower cytotoxic effects for normal human oral keratinocytes, indicating that hinokitiol displays  a high potential for safe and effective applications in oral health care.

AB  == objective: while aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) is highly associated  with localised aggressive periodontitis (lap) many aa-carriers do not develop lap. this study was designed to determine whether specific salivary factors could distinguish between subjects who have aa initially and remain healthy (h/aa) as compared to those who develop lap (lap/aa). design: h/aa subjects and healthy controls with no aa (h) were enrolled in a longitudinal cohort study to investigate initiation of bone loss (lap) over 3 years. after detection of lap, stored saliva from 10 h, 10 h/aa, and 10 lap/aa subjects was thawed, processed, and tested for (1) lactoferrin (lf) concentration and iron levels; (2) agglutination of aa; (3) killing of gram-positive bacteria. results: lap/aa saliva levels of lf iron were low prior to and after bone loss (3.6+1.7ngfe/mug)  (lap/aa vs. h and h/aa p</=0.01). saliva from h/aa subjects caused aa to agglutinate significantly more than h or lap/aa saliva (p</=0.01). lap/aa saliva  killed streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis and lactobacillus in vitro by  >83%. saliva from h individuals killed these bacteria by <3.3% (lap/aa vs. h; p</=0.01). h/aa killing was intermediate. conclusion: lap/aa saliva showed: low levels of lf iron, minimal aa agglutinating activity, and high killing activity against gram-positive bacteria. aa-positive healthy saliva (h/aa) showed: higher  levels of lf iron, maximal aa agglutinating activity, and moderate killing of gram-positive bacteria. a salivary activity profile can distinguish between subjects who are aa-positive and remain healthy from those who develop lap.

TI  == antibacterial effects of blackberry extract target periodontopathogens.
AB  == background and objective: antimicrobial agents provide valuable adjunctive therapy for the prevention and the control of oral diseases. limitations in their prolonged use have stimulated the search for new, naturally occurring agents with more specific activity and fewer adverse effects. here we sought to determine the antibacterial properties of blackberry extract (bbe) in vitro against oral bacterial commensals and periodontopathogens. material and methods: the effects of whole and fractionated bbe on the metabolism of 10 different oral bacteria were evaluated using the colorimetric water-soluble tetrazolium-1 assay. the bactericidal effects of whole bbe against fusobacterium nucleatum were determined by quantitating the numbers of colony-forming units (cfus). cytotoxicity was determined in oral epithelial (okf6) cells. results: bbe at 350-1400 mug/ml reduced the metabolic activity of porphyromonas gingivalis, f. nucleatum and streptococcus mutans. the reduced metabolic activity observed for f. nucleatum corresponded to a reduction in the numbers of cfus following exposure to bbe for  as little as 1 h, indicative of its bactericidal properties. an anthocyanin-enriched fraction of bbe reduced the metabolic activity of f. nucleatum, but not of p. gingivalis or s. mutans, suggesting the contribution of  species-specific agents in the whole bbe. oral epithelial cell viability was not  reduced following exposure to whole bbe (2.24-1400 mug/ml) for </= 6 h. conclusion: bbe alters the metabolic activity of oral periodontopathogens while demonstrating a minimal effect on commensals. the specific antibacterial properties of bbe shown in this study, along with its previously demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties, make this natural extract a promising target as an adjunct for prevention and/or complementary therapy of periodontal infections.

TI  == peripheral arterial disease associated with caries and periodontal disease.
AB  == background: peripheral arterial disease (pad) is an important cardiovascular disorder of the peripheral arteries. chronic infections, such as periodontitis, may play an important role in the etiology and pathophysiology of pad and other cardiovascular conditions. recently, streptococcus mutans has been found with high frequency in atheromatous plaques. the aim of this study is to evaluate the  possible clinical and microbiologic association between pad and periodontitis and dental caries. methods: thirty patients with pad and 30 control individuals were  selected. pad and its severity were established by the use of the ankle-brachial  index (abi). clinical attachment loss (al); probing depth; decayed, missing, and  filled teeth (dmft) index; and c-reactive protein (crp) levels were evaluated. the presence of bacterial dna from streptococcus mutans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was identified by polymerase chain reaction in subgingival biofilm and serum. results: patients with >/=30% al >/= 4 mm had six-fold increased risk of having pad (odds ratio = 8.18; 95% confidence interval = 1.21 to 35.23; p = 0.031). there was statistical difference in the crp (p = 0.0413) and dmft index (p = 0.0002), with elevated number of missing teeth (p = 0.0459) in the pad group compared with the control group. there were no significant differences in the frequency of bacteria in serum and subgingival plaque. conclusion: there was a positive relationship between periodontitis based on al and pad determined by the abi (odds ratio = 8.18).

TI  == inhibitory activity of aloe vera gel on some clinically isolated cariogenic and periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == aloe vera is a medicinal plant with anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antidiabetic and immune-boosting properties. in the present study we investigated the inhibitory activities of aloe vera gel on some cariogenic (streptococcus mutans), periodontopathic (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis) and an opportunistic periodontopathogen (bacteroides fragilis) isolated from patients with dental caries and periodontal diseases. twenty isolates of each of these bacteria were investigated for their sensitivity to aloe vera gel using the disk diffusion and microdilution methods. s. mutans was the species most sensitive to aloe vera gel with a mic of 12.5 microg/ml, while a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and b. fragilis were less sensitive, with a mic of 25-50 microg/ml (p < 0.01). based on our present findings it is concluded that aloe vera gel at optimum concentration could be used as an antiseptic for prevention of dental caries and periodontal diseases.

TI  == oral microbiota in swiss adolescents.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of the study was to determine the prevalence of different oral microbes in gingival plaque samples and in samples from the dorsum of the tongue in a swiss adolescent population. materials and methods: ninety-nine adolescents between 15 and 18 years were enrolled. plaque index, bleeding on probing (bop), the periodontal screening index, and decayed missed filled tooth (dmft) index were recorded. samples from subgingival plaque and swabs from the tongue were analyzed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. additionally, counts of streptococus mutans and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were determined by real-time pcr. results: periodontitis was  not diagnosed in any of the subjects but all of them presented signs of gingival  inflammation displaying a mean bop of 28%. ten (10.1%) subjects were tested positive for p. gingivalis, each 22 (22.2%) for a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. forsythia, (47.5%) for t. denticola. t. denticola and s. mutans showed a high affinity to the gingival plaque, whereas t. forsythia was often detected from the dorsum of the tongue. dmft was associated with s. mutans counts, and bop correlated with counts of p. gingivalis and t. denticola. conclusions: the present data indicate that: (a) gingivitis but not periodontitis is a common finding among swiss adolescents, and (b) bacteria associated with periodontitis were frequently detected in the subgingival dental plaque and on the dorsum of the tongue in swiss adolescents with gingivitis. clinical relevance: although gingivitis was a frequent finding in swiss adolescents, periodontitis was not detected in this population. the dorsum of the tongue appears to represent an important reservoir for periodontopathic bacteria.

TI  == a comparative evaluation of the antibacterial efficacy of honey in vitro and antiplaque efficacy in a 4-day plaque regrowth model in vivo: preliminary results.
AB  == background: honey has a potent broad-spectrum antibacterial action that may make  it suitable for "anti-infective" treatment of periodontal disease. the aims of this study are as follows: 1) to evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of honey against oral bacteria and compare the same with 0.2% chlorhexidine; and 2) to compare antiplaque efficacy in vivo with chlorhexidine. methods: the study was conducted in two parts. in the in vitro part, the inhibitory effects of three test agents, 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate, honey mouthwash, and saline, against six oral bacteria at concentrations of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, and 512  mug/ml were tested in duplicate. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was set as the lowest concentration of the agent that completely inhibited the growth of the test species. the in vivo part consisted of a double-masked parallel clinical trial based on a 4-day plaque regrowth model. sixty-six volunteers, 20 to 24 years of age, participated in the study, and the plaque scores were compared at baseline and at the end of 4 days. the kruskal-wallis test was used for significance, and the mann-whitney u test was used for pairwise comparison of the groups. the mean plaque scores were 1.77 +/- 0.86, 1.64 +/- 0.90, and 3.27 +/- 0.83 for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. results: the honey mouthrinse effectively inhibited the six tested microorganisms. the chlorhexidine gluconate  rinse had the lowest mics compared with honey and saline rinses for all test species examined. the in vivo results revealed that plaque formation was inhibited/reduced by chlorhexidine and honey rinses. conclusion: honey has antibacterial action against tested oral microorganisms and also has antiplaque action.

TI  == a five-species transcriptome array for oral mixed-biofilm studies.
AB  == background: oral polymicrobial interactions and biofilm formation are associated  with initiation and progression of caries, gingivitis, and periodontitis. transcriptome studies of such interactions, allowing a first mechanistic insight, are hampered by current single-species array designs. methodology/principal findings: in this study we used 385 k nimblegene technology for design and evaluation of an array covering the full genomes of 5 important physiological-, cariogenic-, and periodontitis-associated microorganisms (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and porphyromonas gingivalis). array hybridization was done with cdna from cultures grown for 24 h anaerobically. single species experiments identified cross-species hybridizing array probes. these probes could be neglected in a mixed-species experimental setting without the need to exclude  the whole genes from the analysis. between 69% and almost 99% of the genomes were actively transcribed under the mono-species planktonic, monolayer, and biofilm conditions. the influence of streptococcus mitis (not represented on the array) on s. mutans gene transcription was determined as a test for a dual-species mixed biofilm setup. phenotypically, under the influence of s. mitis an increase in s.  mutans biofilm mass and a decrease in media ph-value were noticed, thereby confirming previously published data. employing a stringent cut-off (2-fold, p<0.05), 19 s. mutans transcripts were identified with increased abundance, and 11 with decreased abundance compared to a s. mutans mono-species biofilm. several of these genes have previously been found differentially regulated under general  and acid stress, thereby confirming the value of this array. conclusions/significance: this new array allows transcriptome studies on multi-species oral biofilm interactions. it may become an important asset in future oral biofilm and inhibitor/therapy studies.

TI  == comparative evaluation of two structurally related flavonoids, isoliquiritigenin  and liquiritigenin, for their oral infection therapeutic potential.
AB  == isoliquiritigenin (1) and liquiritigenin (2) are structurally related flavonoids  found in a variety of plants. the purpose of this study was to perform a comparative analysis of biological properties of these compounds in regard to their therapeutic potential for oral infections. compound 1 demonstrated significant antibacterial activity against three major periodontopathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia. in  contrast, 2 exerted less pronounced effects on the above bacterial species. neither compound was effective against cariogenic bacteria (streptococcus mutans  and streptococcus sobrinus). furthermore, 1 exhibited a stronger inhibitory activity than 2 toward p. gingivalis collagenase and human matrix metalloproteinase 9. finally, the capacity of 1 to attenuate the inflammatory response of macrophages induced by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide (lps) was much higher when compared to 2. the activation of transcriptional factors nuclear factor-kappab (nf-kappab) p65 and activator protein-1 (ap-1) associated with the lps-induced inflammatory response in macrophages was inhibited strongly by 1, but less affected by 2.

TI  == live/dead real-time polymerase chain reaction to assess new therapies against dental plaque-related pathologies.
AB  == dna-based methodology for the identification and detection of specific bacteria in dental plaque offers advantages over culturing techniques. one drawback of current molecular techniques like real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (rt-qpcr) is that they are not able to distinguish between live or dead  bacteria. to overcome this problem an assay was assessed to discriminate between  viable or dead bacteria using dna intercalating substances, propidium monoazide (pma) and ethidium monoazide (ema) in combination with rt-qpcr. the assay was tested on oral pathogens: streptococcus mutans, prevotella intermedia and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. to determine the effectiveness of ema and  pma, different concentrations (from 5 to 100 mug ml(-1)) of the substances were added to viable or heat-killed suspensions of both organisms (ranging from 10(8)  to 10(4) colony-forming units ml(-1)). afterwards, pma was tested on mixtures of  varying ratios of viable and dead cells. after dna extraction, rt-qpcr was performed using species-specific primers. both compounds inhibited pcr amplification from dead cells. the ema treatment resulted in the largest signal decrease but ema also inhibited dna amplification from viable cells. for this reason, pma was selected for use in further experiments. it was shown to be efficient in allowing selective pcr detection of only viable cells in mixtures containing both viable and dead cells. the amount of amplified dna corresponded to the percentage of viable cells in the sample. the developed assay will potentially be useful for assessing bacterial loads remaining after disinfection  protocols without interference by non-viable bacteria.

TI  == [analysis of the inhibitory capacity against bacterial growth of several materials of dental use. preliminar].
AB  == dental plaque is one of the reasons for odontogenic infection. although multiple  bacteria are involved in these processes, a.actinomycetemcomitans and s.mutans are considered directly responsible for localized aggressive periodontitis and caries respectively. on the other hand, it seems clear that the oral flora utilizes especially not well polished surfaces or without bacteriastatic capacity in order to obtain better adhesion. based on those facts we expect to prove the inhibitory capacity "in vitro" of some materials used for teeth restoration and for the cementation of accessories against one common bacterium in the human flora and two pathogenic bacteria of the oral cavity. we prepared, following the  manufacturer's instructions, 18 discs for each one of the materials used in the study (2 composites and 2 ionomeros of glass). 6 discs of each material are incubated with a. actinomycetemcomitans, s. mutans and e. coli. 3 of them are incubated directly on the discs and the other 3 are incubated previously in an artificial saliva for 24 days. from the results, should be highlighted that only  one of the materials demonstrated inhibitory capacity against a. actinomycetemcomitans and e. coli. none of them demonstrated inhibitory capacity  against s. mutans.

TI  == garlic allicin as a potential agent for controlling oral pathogens.
AB  == garlic has been used medicinally throughout human history. allicin is considered  the most therapeutic constituent of garlic. this study tested the antimicrobial activity of garlic allicin on oral pathogens associated with dental caries and periodontitis. allicin was found effective against all the tested bacteria. the broth dilution method revealed that planktonic growth of the cariogenic, gram-positive species streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, and actinomyces oris was inhibited by an allicin concentration of 600 mug/ml or higher. planktonic growth  of the tested gram-negative periopathogenic species aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum was inhibited by a minimum allicin concentration of 300 mug/ml. porphyromonas gingivalis, an anaerobic, gram-negative pathogen and the bacterium most associated with chronic periodontitis, demonstrated the lowest sensitivity to allicin (2,400 mug/ml). gel zymography and the synthetic chromogenic substrate n(alpha)-benzoyl-l-arginine 4-nitroanilide hydrochloride demonstrated that allicin inhibits the proteases of  p. gingivalis, including the arginine and lysine gingipains known as major virulence factors of this organism. a gingipain-inactivated mutant demonstrated high sensitivity to allicin (<300 mug/ml), revealing that gingipains confer resistance to allicin. live/dead staining followed by analysis with confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that allicin was bactericidal to s. mutans grown in mature biofilms. however, this bactericidal effect was reduced as biofilm depth increased. in conclusion, these results support the traditional medicinal use of garlic and suggest the use of allicin for alleviating dental diseases.

TI  == clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  == it has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. it is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. to investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the dna-dna hybridization technique. actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for t. forsythia, campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, parvimonas micra, and treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of a. oris, capnocytophaga ochracea, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus intermedius, selenomonas noxia, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, and veillonella parvula. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while fusobacterium  nucleatum loaded on both. these findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of  subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.

TI  == short- and medium-chain fatty acids exhibit antimicrobial activity for oral microorganisms.
AB  == objectives: this study assessed the antibacterial activity of short-, medium-, and long-chain fatty acids against various oral microorganisms. methods: the short-chain fatty acids [formic acid (c1), acetic acid (c2), propionic acid (c3), butyric acid (c4), isobutyric acid (c4), isovaleric acid (c5), hexanoic acid (c6)], medium-chain fatty acids [octanoic acid (c8), capric acid (c10), lauric acid (12)], and long-chain fatty acids [myristic acid (c14), palmitic acid (c16)], were investigated for antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus sanguis, candida albicans, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis. results: the data demonstrated that the fatty acids exhibited patterns of inhibition against oral bacteria with some specificity that appeared  related more to the bacterial species that the general structural characteristics of the microorganism. as a group the fatty acids were much less effective against c. albicans than the oral bacteria, with effectiveness limited to hexanoic, octanoic, and lauric acids. formic acid, capric, and lauric acids were broadly inhibitory for the bacteria. interestingly, fatty acids that are produced at metabolic end-products by a number of these bacteria, were specifically inactive  against the producing species, whilst substantially inhibiting the growth of other oral microorganisms. conclusions: the results indicate that the antimicrobial activity of short-chain fatty acids (scfas), medium-chain fatty acids (mcfas), long-chain fatty acids (lcfas) could influence the microbial ecology in the oral cavity via at least 2 potential pathways. first, the agents delivered exogenously as therapeutic adjuncts could be packaged to enhance a microbial-regulatory environment in the subgingival sulcus. second, it would be the intrinsic nature of these fatty acid inhibitors in contributing to the characteristics of the microbial biofilms, their evolution, and emergence of species within the biofilms. further studies on these functions are required to better understand the nature of these potential microbial interactions in the biofilms.

TI  == setup of an in vitro test system for basic studies on biofilm behavior of mixed-species cultures with dental and periodontal pathogens.
AB  == background: caries and periodontitis are important human diseases associated with formation of multi-species biofilms. the involved bacteria are intensively studied to understand the molecular basis of the interactions in such biofilms. this study established a basic in vitro single and mixed-species culture model for oral bacteria combining three complimentary methods. the setup allows a rapid screening for effects in the mutual species interaction. furthermore, it is easy  to handle, inexpensive, and reproducible. methods: streptococcus mitis, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, typical inhabitants of the healthy oral cavity, s. mutans as main carriogenic species, and porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, s. intermedius and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans as periodontitis-associated bacteria, were investigated for their biofilm forming ability. different liquid growth media were evaluated. safranin-staining allowed monitoring of biofilm formation under the chosen conditions. viable counts and microscopy permitted investigation of biofilm behavior in mixed-species and transwell setups. findings: s. mitis, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis and p. micra failed to form biofilm structures. s. mutans, s. sanguinis, s. intermedius and s. salivarius established abundant biofilm masses in cdm/sucrose. a. actinomycetemcomitans formed patchy monolayers. for in depth analysis s. mitis, s. mutans and a. actinomycetemcomitans were chosen, because i) they are representatives of the physiological-, cariogenic and periodontitis-associated bacterial flora, respectively and ii) their difference in their biofilm forming ability. microscopic analysis confirmed the results of safranin staining. investigation of two species combinations of s. mitis with either s. mutans or a. actinomycetemcomitans revealed bacterial interactions influencing biofilm mass, biofilm structure and cell viability. conclusions: this setup shows safranin staining, microscopic analysis and viable counts together are crucial for basic examination and evaluation of biofilms. our experiment generated meaningful results, exemplified by the noted s. mitis influence, and allows a fast decision about the most important bacterial interactions which should be investigated in depth.

TI  == photolysis of hydrogen peroxide, an effective disinfection system via hydroxyl radical formation.
AB  == the relationship between the amount of hydroxyl radicals generated by photolysis  of h(2)o(2) and bactericidal activity was examined. h(2)o(2) (1 m) was irradiated with laser light at a wavelength of 405 nm to generate hydroxyl radicals. electron spin resonance spin trapping analysis showed that the amount of hydroxyl radicals produced increased with the irradiation time. four species of pathogenic oral bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, streptococcus mutans, and enterococcus faecalis, were used in the bactericidal assay. s. mutans in a model biofilm was also examined. laser irradiation of suspensions in 1 m h(2)o(2) resulted in a >99.99% reduction of the viable counts  of each of the test species within 3 min of treatment. treatment of s. mutans in  a biofilm resulted in a >99.999% reduction of viable counts within 3 min. other results demonstrated that the bactericidal activity was dependent on the amount of hydroxyl radicals generated. treatment of bacteria with 200 to 300 mum hydroxyl radicals would result in reductions of viable counts of >99.99%.

TI  == effects of a composition containing lactoferrin and lactoperoxidase on oral malodor and salivary bacteria: a randomized, double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled clinical trial.
AB  == we report a clinical trial of the effects of test tablets containing bovine lactoferrin and lactoperoxidase on oral malodor and salivary bacteria. fifteen subjects with volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) in mouth air above the olfactory threshold (h(2)s >1.5 or ch(3)sh >0.5 ng/10 ml) as detected by gas chromatography were enrolled in the trial. either a test or a placebo tablet was ingested twice  at 1-h intervals in two crossover phases. mouth air was monitored for vsc levels  at the baseline before ingestion of a tablet, 10 min after the first ingestion, 1 h (just before the second ingestion), and 2 h after the first ingestion. whole saliva was analyzed at the baseline and at 2 h for bacterial numbers. at 10 min,  the level of ch(3)sh was significantly lower in the test group (median [interquartile range] = 0.28 [0.00-0.68] ng/10 ml) compared to that in the placebo group (0.73 [0.47-1.00] ng/10 ml; p = 0.011). the median concentration of ch(3)sh in the test group was below the olfactory threshold after 10 min until 2  h, whereas the level in the placebo group was above the threshold during the experimental period. no difference in the numbers of salivary bacteria was detected by culturing or quantitative pcr, but terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism detected one fragment with a significantly lower copy number  at 2 h in the test group (mean +/- standard error, 4.89 +/- 0.11 log(10) copies/10 microl) compared to that in the placebo group (5.38 +/- 0.15 log(10) copies/10 microl; p = 0.033). these results indicate a suppressive effect of the  test composition on oral malodor and suggest an influence on oral bacteria.

TI  == aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans accelerates atherosclerosis with an increase in atherogenic factors in spontaneously hyperlipidemic mice.
AB  == cariogenic and periodontal pathogens are thought to be etiological factors in the development of cardiovascular disease. we assessed the involvement of the periodontal pathogen aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and cariogenic pathogen streptococcus mutans in the development of atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein e-deficient spontaneously hyperlipidemic (apoe(shl)) mice. the mice were treated intravenously with a. actinomycetemcomitans hk1651, s. mutans gs-5, or phosphate-buffered saline three times a week for 3 weeks and killed at 15 weeks of age. the areas of the aortic sinus that were covered with atherosclerotic plaque were significantly larger in apoe(shl) mice challenged with a. actinomycetemcomitans compared with s. mutans- or vehicle-challenged mice. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans challenge increased serum high-sensitive c-reactive protein and lipopolysaccharide levels. bacterial dna was detected in the blood, heart, and spleen, but not in the liver. furthermore,  serum interleukin-6 (il-6), il-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and mcp-1 levels and toll-like receptor (tlr)2, tlr4, icam-1, e-selectin, p-selectin, lox-1, hsp60, ccl19, ccl21, ccr7, and mcp-1 expressions in the aorta were significantly  increased in mice challenged with a. actinomycetemcomitans. these results suggest that systemic infection with a. actinomycetemcomitans accelerates atherosclerosis in apoe(shl) mice by exposing the whole microorganisms or their products, followed by initiating inflammation. increases in proatherogenic factors may explain the aggravation of atherosclerosis by a. actinomycetemcomitans infection.

TI  == pcr detection of streptococcus mutans and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in dental plaque samples from haitian adolescents.
AB  == streptococcus mutans and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans are oral pathogens associated with dental caries and periodontitis, respectively. the aim of this study was to determine the colonization of these two microorganisms in the dental plaque of a group of haitian adolescents using two different polymerase chain reaction (pcr) methods, standard pcr, and quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) assays. fifty-four pooled supra-gingival plaque samples and 98 pooled sub-gingival plaque samples were obtained from 104 12- to19-year-old rural-dwelling haitians. the total genomic dna of bacteria was isolated from these samples, and all participants also received caries and periodontal examinations. caries prevalence was 42.2%, and the mean decayed, missing, and filled surface (dmfs) was 2.67 +/- 5.3. more than half of the adolescents (53.3%) experienced periodontal pockets (community periodontal index score >/=3). s. mutans was detected in 67.3% by qpcr and 38.8% by pcr of the supra-gingival plaque samples (p < 0.01), and 36.6% by qpcr and 8.1% by pcr of the sub-gingival  samples (p < 0.01). a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in 85.1% by qpcr and 44.0% by pcr of the sub-gingival samples (p < 0.01), but the prevalence was similar, 67.3% by qpcr and 59.2% by pcr, in the supra-gingival plaque samples. neither age nor gender was significantly correlated to the bacterial colonization. the results demonstrated a moderate-to-high prevalence of s. mutans and a. actinomycetemcomitans in the haitian adolescent population, and qpcr is more sensitive than standard pcr in field conditions. these findings suggest that qpcr should be considered for field oral epidemiologic studies and may be necessary in investigations having major logistic challenges.

TI  == a novel bioactivity of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and their ester derivatives.
AB  == fish oil, enriched in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 pufa), is widely used as a dietary or nutritional supplement with numerous benefits, including as  an anti-inflammatory particularly linked to atherosclerosis. while n-3 pufa have  been suggested to be able to improve oral health through a reduction in inflammation through elevations in these fatty acids in serum and cellular membranes, information is lacking for the possibility that these fatty acids could directly impact the survival and growth of the oral bacteria that trigger the chronic inflammatory responses. the n-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (epa), docosahexaenoic acid (dha) and alpha-linolenic acid (ala), and their fatty acid ethyl esters, alaee, epaee, dhaee were analysed for antibacterial activity against oral pathogens. this study demonstrated a novel bioactivity of the three  major n-3 pufa, epa, dha, and ala, and their ester derivatives. our experimental  data indicated that n-3 pufa and their ester derivatives exhibited strong antibacterial activity against various oral pathogens, including streptococcus mutans, candida albicans, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis. this study suggested that n-3 pufa could have a positive therapeutic effect for improving oral health via their antibacterial activities, besides their anti-inflammatory effects.

TI  == periodontitis, periodontopathic bacteria and lactoferrin.
AB  == lactoferrin (lf) is a component of saliva and is suspected to be a defense factor against oral pathogens including streptococcus mutans and candida albicans. periodontitis is a very common oral disease caused by periodontopathic bacteria.  antimicrobial activities and other biological effects of lf against representative periodontopathic bacteria, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans,  porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia, have been widely studied. association of polymorphisms in lf with incidence of aggressive periodontitis and the role of lf in the gingival crevicular fluid as a marker of periodontitis severity have also been reported. periodontopathic bacteria reside as a biofilm in supragingival and subgingival plaque. our recent study indicated that lf exhibits antibacterial activity against planktonic forms of p. gingivalis and p.  intermedia at higher concentrations, and furthermore, lf effectively inhibits biofilm formation and reduces the established biofilm of these bacteria at physiological concentrations. a small-scale clinical study indicated that oral administration of bovine lf reduces p. gingivalis and p. intermedia in the subgingival plaque of chronic periodontitis patients. lf seems to be a biofilm inhibitor of periodontopathic bacteria in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == clinical status and detection of periodontopathogens and streptococcus mutans in  children with high levels of supragingival biofilm.
AB  == knowledge about the presence of some important oral pathogens is an important step in better identifying children at risk for periodontal and/or caries diseases in later life. the purpose of this study was to detect the presence of streptococcus mutans (sm), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), campylobacter rectus (cr), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), and tannerella forsythia (tf) in gingival biofilm samples from 196 children, and to assess whether any of these pathogens are more associated with gingival inflammation extension and the decayed/missing/filled teeth (dmft/dmft)  index. the subjects presented plaque index greater than 80% and were divided in 3 groups according to the bleeding index (bi): i) low bleeding (< 30%), ii) medium  bleeding (31 - 59%) and iii) high bleeding (> 60%). the presence of each pathogen was determined by pcr. the prevalence of sm was 71.9% and the mean dmft/dmft was  6.68. the prevalence in low, medium and high bleeding groups was 43.5%, 34.5% and 46.7% for aa; 43.5%, 37.9%, and 36.7% for cr; 99.1%, 100%, and 96.7% for pg; 56.5%, 56.9%, and 66.7% for pi; and 58.3%, 60.3%, and 56.7% for tf, respectively. pg (99.0%) was the most prevalent periodontal pathogen detected followed by tf (58.7%), pi (58.2%), aa (41.3%) and cr (40.8%). our study indicated that in this  high plaque index population studied, a high prevalence of sm and high mean dmft  were observed. in addition, the presence of pi was associated with the presence of inflammation (p < 0.05) whereas cr was associated with periodontal health (p < 0.05).

TI  == micro-organism and cell viability on antimicrobially modified titanium.
AB  == when titanium is anodized by discharge in nacl solution, both antimicrobial activity and osteoconductivity are conferred. the viability of adherent micro-organisms and cells on antimicrobial titanium remains uncertain. we hypothesized that a thin peroxidation barrier would efficiently destroy adherent  bacteria, whereas adherent osteoblastic cells would be viable, since these cells  adhere to the surface indirectly though serum proteins. the efficacy of antimicrobial titanium appears to be based on peroxidation, since peroxidation products were detected in parallel with the destruction of bacterial cell-surface structures. the peroxidation effect of antimicrobial titanium was confined to the surface within narrow limits. the viability of osteoblastic cells on the surface  was strongly dependent on the presence of serum protein, whereas that of adherent streptococcus mutans was not affected by the presence of serum proteins. therefore, differences in the adherent systems used by bacteria and osteoblastic  cells are important determinants of their viability on antimicrobial titanium.

TI  == bacterial penetration through antibiotic-loaded guided tissue regeneration membranes.
AB  == background: this study compared bacterial penetration through guided tissue regeneration (gtr) membranes impregnated with antibiotics. methods: three barrier membranes, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (eptfe) membrane, collagen membrane,  and glycolide fiber composite membrane, were loaded with amoxicillin or tetracycline. the penetration of streptococcus mutans and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) through the gtr membranes was achieved using a device consisting of an inner tube and an  outer bottle filled with culture media. results: the penetration of s. mutans or  a. actinomycetemcomitans into the inner tubes significantly decreased with all of the antibiotic-loaded membranes compared to membranes without antibiotics. however, differences were found in the behavior of the three membranes. the antibiotic-loaded eptfe membranes showed the best barrier effect. moreover, the inhibitory effect of tetracycline on s. mutans was greater than that of amoxicillin for all gtr membranes. furthermore, the inhibitory effect of tetracycline on a. actinomycetemcomitans was lower than that of amoxicillin with  the glycolide fiber membrane. conclusions: the results showed that penetration of s. mutans and a. actinomycetemcomitans through amoxicillin- or tetracycline-loaded eptfe membrane, glycolide fiber membrane, and collagen membrane was delayed and/or reduced. thus, incorporation of an antibiotic into the membrane may be of value when controlling membrane-associated infection during gtr therapy.

TI  == oral bacteria induce a differential activation of human immunodeficiency virus-1  promoter in t cells, macrophages and dendritic cells.
AB  == introduction: the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) can integrate into t cells,  macrophages and dendritic cells resulting in a latent infection. reports have also demonstrated that various microbial and host cell factors can trigger hiv reactivation leading to hiv recrudescence, potentially undermining highly active  antiretroviral therapies. methods: this study evaluated the capacity of oral bacteria associated with chronic periodontal infections to stimulate hiv promoter activation in various cell models of hiv latency. results: t cells (1g5) challenged with oral bacteria demonstrated a dose-response of hiv promoter activation with a subset of the bacteria, as well as kinetics that were generally similar irrespective of the stimuli. direct bacterial challenge of the t cells resulted in increased activation of approximately 1.5- to 7-fold over controls. challenge of macrophages (bf24) indicated different kinetics for individual bacteria and resulted in consistent increases in promoter activation of five fold to six fold over basal levels for all bacteria except streptococcus mutans. dendritic cells showed increases in hiv reactivation of 7- to 34-fold specific for individual species of bacteria. conclusion: these results suggested that oral bacteria have the capability to reactivate hiv from latently infected cells, showing a relationship of mature dendritic cells > immature dendritic cells > macrophages > or = t cells. expression of various pattern recognition receptors on these various cell types may provide insight into the primary receptors/signaling pathways used for reactivation by the bacteria.

TI  == combination of 10% edta, photosan, and a blue light hand-held photopolymerizer to inactivate leading oral bacteria in dentistry in vitro.
AB  == aims: the goal of this study was to investigate the phototoxicity of photosan in  combination with edta and a hand-held photopolymerizer used in dentistry for light-curing resins against leading key pathogens in caries, endodontic treatment failures, and periodontitis respectively. methods and results: cellular uptake of photosan was detected by fluorescence spectroscopy for streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis but not for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. addition of 10% edta enabled the uptake of photosan by a. actinomycetemcomitans. killing of s. mutans and e. faecalis mediated by photosan and blue light was concentration and light dose dependent, achieving a >or=99.9% (>or=3 log(10) reduction) efficacy of bacteria killing. in the presence of 10% edta, photosan induced a reduction of >or=4 log(10) in the viability of a. actinomycetemcomitans at a concentration of 50 microg ml(-1), upon activation at a dose of 9.65 j cm(-2) for 60 s. edta alone, light alone, and photosan alone were not able to kill bacteria. conclusions: ten per cent edta and photosan cause a potent phototoxicity against oral bacteria upon illumination with a photopolymerizer. significance and impact of the study: increasing antibiotic resistance and insufficient drug concentrations within the sulcus fluid are responsible for lacking antimicrobial efficacy. this study provides useful information that combination of photosan, edta, and a photopolymerizer may be a potentially powerful tool for the efficient destroying of key oral bacteria.

AB  == background/aims: oral bacteria, including cariogenic and periodontal pathogens, are thought to be etiological factors in the development of cardiovascular diseases. to define this relationship, we analyzed the distribution of oral bacterial species in cardiovascular specimens. method: following acceptance into  the study, 203 consecutive patients were analyzed, from whom 82 aortic valve specimens, 35 mitral valve specimens, and 86 aortic aneurysmal wall specimens, of which 16 contained aneurysmal thrombus tissues, were obtained. in addition, a total of 58 dental plaque specimens were collected from the same group of patients who underwent heart valve replacement or removal of aortic aneurysms. bacterial dna was extracted from both cardiovascular tissues and dental plaque in those cases and then species-specific polymerase chain reaction assays were used  to analyze the occurrences of six oral streptococcal and six periodontal bacterial species. results: streptococcus mutans was the most frequently detected species in the cardiovascular specimens, followed by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. as for dental plaque specimens from patients who underwent cardiovascular operations, most of the tested periodontitis-related species as well as oral streptococci were detected at high frequencies. furthermore, the positive rate of s. mutans in cardiovascular specimens from patients whose dental plaque specimens were also positive for s. mutans was 78%, which was significantly higher than any other tested species when the same analysis was performed. conclusion: our results suggest that specific oral bacterial species,  such as s. mutans and a. actinomycetemcomitans, are related to bacteremia and may be etiologic factors for the development of cardiovascular diseases.

TI  == streptococcus cristatus attenuates fusobacterium nucleatum-induced interleukin-8  expression in oral epithelial cells.
AB  == background and objective: oral epithelial cells may be invaded by a polymicrobial intracellular flora, including pathogens together with commensals. various oral pathogens can induce the production of interleukin-8, a potent neutrophil chemotractant, in oral epithelial cells. evidence from the gut suggests that commensal species may modulate inflammatory responses to pathogens. the aim of this study was to examine the interleukin-8 responses of oral epithelial cells to an oral pro-inflammatory species, fusobacterium nucleatum, in combination with an oral commensal, streptococcus cristatus. material and methods: kb, tert-2, tr146  and scc15 cells were cocultured with f. nucleatum and s. cristatus, either alone  or in combination, at 37 degrees c in 5% co2 under various conditions. the mrna expression of interleukin-8 was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and protein secretion was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay. results: f. nucleatum alone evoked a potent interleukin-8 response, whereas s. cristatus alone did not induce significant interleukin-8 expression in oral epithelial cells. when present together, s. cristatus attenuated the f. nucleatum-induced interleukin-8 production in the four oral epithelial cell lines to varying degrees. the inhibitory effect of s. cristatus was independent of its  viability and its co-aggregation with f. nucleatum, was not related to soluble bacterial products and appeared to require bacterial contact with epithelial cells. similar effects were seen with several other species of oral streptococci. conclusion: our data suggest that s. cristatus may exert immunomodulatory effects on the interleukin-8 response of oral epithelial cells to f. nucleatum challenge.

TI  == strong antibacterial effect of miswak against oral microorganisms associated with periodontitis and caries.
AB  == background: the chewing stick (miswak) is used for oral hygiene in many parts of  the world. in addition to the mechanical removal of plaque, an antibacterial effect has been postulated; however, tests of miswak extract from salvadora persica (arak) disclosed only low to moderate antibacterial effects. this may be  attributable to the extraction process. our aim was to test in vitro the antibacterial effect of miswak pieces, without extraction, on bacteria implicated in the etiology of periodontitis and caries. methods: miswak pieces were standardized by size and weight (0.07 and 0.14 g) and tested against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, and, as a reference, haemophilus influenzae. the miswak pieces were tested in two ways: embedded in the agar plate or suspended above the agar plate. results: the inhibitory effect was most pronounced on p. gingivalis,  a. actinomycetemcomitans, and h. influenzae, less on s. mutans, and least on l. acidophilus. suspended miswak had comparable or stronger effects than miswak embedded in agar. the 0.14-g suspended miswak exhibited significantly greater inhibition on a. actinomycetemcomitans and h. influenzae than the 0.14-g miswak embedded in agar (p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively). conclusions: miswak embedded in agar or suspended above the agar plate had strong antibacterial effects against all bacteria tested. the antibacterial effect of suspended miswak pieces  suggests the presence of volatile active antibacterial compounds.

TI  == treatment outcomes of dental flossing in twins: molecular analysis of the interproximal microflora.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to assess the effects of dental flossing on the microbial composition of interproximal plaque samples in matched  twins. methods: the study was a two-treatment, examiner-masked, randomized, parallel-group, controlled study. fifty-one twin pairs between 12 and 21 years of age were randomized to a 2-week supervised and unsupervised treatment regimen consisting of tongue brushing and toothbrushing or tongue brushing and toothbrushing plus flossing. the reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay was used to assess levels (abundance) of 26 microbial species in interproximal plaque samples collected from six sites per subject. an integrative computational predictive model estimated average changes in microbial abundance patterns of selected bacterial species from baseline to 2 weeks by comparing treatment groups. results: after the 2-week study period, putative periodontal pathogens and cariogenic bacteria were overabundant in the group that did not floss compared to the group that performed flossing. those included treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), prevotella intermedia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), and streptococcus mutans. microbial species that are not consistent with the development of periodontal disease or dental caries were overabundant in the group that did floss compared to the non-flossing group. conclusion: in a well-matched twin cohort, tooth and tongue brushing plus flossing significantly decreased the abundance of microbial  species associated with periodontal disease and dental caries after a 2-week program.

TI  == analysis of the activity to induce toll-like receptor (tlr)2- and tlr4-mediated stimulation of supragingival plaque.
AB  == background: the deleterious effects of the accumulation of supragingival plaque are well known, but the role of the proinflammatory property of supragingival plaque in periodontal diseases has not been completely elucidated. the aim of this study was to determine the relevance of toll-like receptor (tlr)2- and tlr4-stimulating activity of supragingival plaque to periodontal parameters. methods: we isolated 144 supragingival plaque samples and analyzed tlr2- and tlr4-stimulating activity using genetically engineered chinese hamster ovary reporter cells that express a reporter molecule upon activation of nuclear factor-kappa b through tlr2 or tlr4. the numbers of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), and streptococcus mutans cells in each plaque sample were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: the activity to induce tlr4-mediated stimulation, but not tlr2-mediated stimulation, was positively associated with the plaque score and bleeding on probing score of the  teeth from which the plaque samples were taken. the activity to induce tlr2-mediated stimulation, but not tlr4-mediated stimulation, was negatively associated with probing depth and clinical attachment level. the ratio of tlr4-/tlr2-mediated stimulation was positively associated with all of those parameters. the number of p. gingivalis cells in each plaque sample was associated with the plaque score and clinical attachment level, but no strong association was observed between the ratio of examined bacteria in each plaque sample and the activity to induce tlr2- or tlr4-mediated stimulation, except for  a weak correlation between the ratio of a. actinomycetemcomitans cells and the activity to induce tlr4-mediated stimulation. conclusion: the tlr2- and tlr4-stimulating activity of supragingival plaque is associated with clinical parameters for gingivitis and periodontitis.

TI  == characterization of oral lactobacilli as potential probiotics for oral health.
AB  == introduction: intestinal lactobacilli have been successfully used as probiotics to treat gastrointestinal disorders, but only limited data are available for the  probiotic properties of oral lactobacilli to combat oral diseases. we aimed to characterize oral lactobacilli for their potential probiotic properties according to the international guidelines for the evaluation of probiotics, and to select potential probiotic strains for oral health. methods: the study included 67 salivary and subgingival lactobacilli of 10 species, isolated from healthy humans. all strains were identified using amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis, tested for antimicrobial activity against oral pathogens, tolerance of  low ph and bile content. thereafter, the lysozyme tolerance and antibiotic susceptibility of 22 potential probiotic strains were assessed. results: the majority of strains suppressed the growth of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and streptococcus mutans, but none inhibited candida albicans. the lowest ph tolerated by lactobacilli following 4 h of incubation was ph 2.5, but none of the strains grew at this ph. all strains tolerated a high concentration of lysozyme (10 mg/ml) and half of the strains tolerated a high concentration of human bile [5% volume/volume (v/v)]. four lactobacillus plantarum and two lactobacillus oris strains expressed resistance to tetracycline and/or doxycycline. conclusions: strains of l. plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus rhamnosus expressed both high antimicrobial activity and high tolerance of environmental stress. the absence of transferable antibiotic-resistance genes in l. plantarum strains remains to be confirmed. these results suggest a potential for oral lactobacilli to be used as probiotics  for oral health.

TI  == smap29 congeners demonstrate activity against oral bacteria and reduced toxicity  against oral keratinocytes.
AB  == introduction: cathelicidins are antimicrobial peptides found in epithelial and mucosal tissues as well as the secondary granules of neutrophils. smap29, a sheep cathelicidin, has differential antimicrobial properties against various pathogens, including periodontal organisms. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties and cytotoxicity of smap29, smap28, and three congeners (smap18a, smap18d, and smap14a). methods: the peptides at concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 250 microg/ml were tested for their activity  against multiple strains of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and porphyromonas gingivalis using a radial diffusion assay. cytotoxicity of keratinocytes was evaluated by measuring lactate dehydrogenase release after incubation with the individual peptides. results: smap28, thought to be the biologically active peptide, was the most potent antimicrobial (range of minimum  inhibitory concentrations 0.06-7.03 microg/ml, p < 0.05); however, the activity of smap28 and smap29 was strongly associated (r = 0.933). the congeners also demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the bacteria tested (range of minimum inhibitory concnetrations 0.21-79 microg/ml). overall, f. nucleatum was the most  susceptible organism, while p. gingivalis was the least susceptible. keratinocyte cytotoxicity was dependent on peptide length and dose. smap28 was the most cytotoxic, while smap14a was the least cytotoxic. conclusion: the antimicrobial activities against oral microorganisms and the minimal toxicity seen in this study suggest that the congeners of smap29 may serve as an alternative to traditional antibiotics in the prevention and treatment of periodontal and other  oral diseases.

TI  == eugenol inhibited the antimicrobial functions of neutrophils.
AB  == eugenol-containing restorative materials are commonly used for vital pulp therapy. a well-regulated host defense response is pivotal for the success of vital pulp therapy. the present study was to assess the effects of eugenol on the antimicrobial functions of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (neutrophils). treatment  with eugenol (< or = 1.25 mmol/l) for 30 minutes did not significantly affect the viability of neutrophils. however, preincubation of neutrophils with eugenol (1.25 mmol/l and 2.5 mmol/l) abolished their bactericidal activity against oral pathogens streptococcus mutans and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. in addition, through the suppression of the extracellular release of myeloperoxidase and the intracellular production of reactive oxygen species, eugenol at sufficient concentrations impaired the activation of neutrophils by cytochalasin  b and fmet-leu-phe (cb/fmlp). these results suggested that the antimicrobial functions of neutrophils were interfered by eugenol, and the inhibitory effects of eugenol (< or = 1.25 mmol/l) were not due to direct killing of neutrophils.

TI  == antibacterial activity of chitosan-based matrices on oral pathogens.
AB  == chitosan is a well sought-after polysaccharide in biomedical applications due to  its biocompatibility, biodegradability to non-toxic substances, and ease of fabrication into various configurations. however, alterations in the anti-bacterial properties of chitosan in various forms is not completely understood. the objective of this study was to evaluate the anti-bacterial properties of chitosan matrices in different configurations against two pathogens-gram-positive streptococcus mutans and gram-negative actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. two-dimensional (2-d) membranes and three-dimensional (3-d) porous scaffolds were synthesized by air drying and controlled-rate freeze  drying. matrices were suspended in bacterial broths with or without lysozyme (enzyme that degrades chitosan). influences of pore size, blending with polycaprolactone (pcl, a synthetic polymer), and neutralization process on bacterial proliferation were studied. transient changes in optical density of the broth, adhesion characteristics, viability, and contact-dependent bacterial activity were assessed. 3-d porous scaffolds were more effective in reducing the  proliferation of s. mutans in suspension than 2-d membranes. however, no significant differences were observed on the proliferation of a. actinomycetemcomitans. presence of lysozyme significantly increased the antibacterial activity of chitosan against a. actinomycetemcomitans. pore size did not affect the proliferation kinetics of either species, with or without lysozyme. naoh neutralization of chitosan increased bacterial adhesion whereas ethanol neutralization inhibited adhesion without lowering proliferation. mat culture tests indicated that chitosan does not allow proliferation on its surface and it loses antibacterial activity upon blending with pcl. results suggest that  the chemical and structural characteristics of chitosan-based matrices can be manipulated to influence the interaction of different bacterial species.

TI  == age-dependent deficiency in saliva and salivary antibodies secretion in down's syndrome.
AB  == objective: down's syndrome (ds) individuals suffer from an increased susceptibility to infections. here, we assessed age-related changes in the salivary-specific humoral immunity of ds subjects. design: parotid and whole saliva were collected from a young group of ds (yds, n=30, 23.3+/-4 years), an older group of ds individuals (ods, n=10, 51.9+/-8 years) and compared to two age-matched groups of healthy volunteers--a young group (yc, n=29, 22.8+/-5 years) and an older group (oc, n=10, 48.4+/-9 years). the levels of total iga, and specific antibodies to three common oral pathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus (aggregatibacter) actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans)  were analysed. results: the limited increases in iga concentrations could not compensate the dramatic reduction in the salivary flow rate observed in ds individuals. therefore, the median secretion rates of the specific antibodies in  whole and parotid saliva were 70-77% and 34-60% (respectively) lower in yds individuals as compared to yc and farther 77-100% and 75-88% (respectively) lower in ods compared to yds. in contrast, the antibody secretion rates were similar for parotid saliva, or even increased for whole saliva of oc, compared with yc. consequently, a dramatic cumulative extreme reduction (>92%) in the bacterial specific salivary antibodies differentiated the adult ds individuals from to their age-matched controls. conclusions: our results indicate a severe immunodeficiency in the secretion rate of the specific salivary iga response of in ds individuals which intensifies with age.

AB  == the paper describes an optimized technique for dna isolation from the streptococcus mutans cultures and from the clinical samples including proteinase  k treatment and detergent lysis, followed by sorbent-based enrichment. this technique was employed for isolating dna from the periodontal bacteria porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and bacteroides forsythus. a multiplex pcr technique was adapted for large-scale studies of clinical samples. an original pcr method was developed for the semiquantitative detection of str. mutans, showing the sensitivity of 100 genome copies per reaction. extensive studies of approximately 2,000 individuals have demonstrated  that these methods are applicable to the study of the dental and gingival microflora in the biological sample from the oral cavity of persons with dental diseases from various age groups.

TI  == saliva from subjects harboring actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans kills streptococcus mutans in vitro.
AB  == background: previous research indicated that patients with localized aggressive periodontitis (lagp) had minimal proximal decay. we speculated that differences in these two proximal dental diseases (lagp and proximal decay) in lagp could be  due to the effect of saliva on the growth of key microorganisms related to these  two infections. carbon dioxide (co(2)) is required for growth of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), the reputed cause of lagp. bicarbonate, a source of co(2), buffers acid production by streptococcus mutans (sm), a key organism associated with caries. the purpose of this study was to determine whether the saliva of lagp patients and subjects with aa had higher levels of bicarbonate, or an elevated ph, and/or reduced survival of sm. methods: eleven aa-positive subjects (seven with lagp) were matched with 11 aa-negative controls. a total of  5 ml saliva obtained from each subject was tested for co(2) levels, ph, and effects on survival of aa and sm. saliva from 22 additional subjects was used for confirmatory data. results: co(2) levels in the test group (aa-positive subjects) and controls (aa-negatives) were similar. no clinically relevant differences were found in salivary ph. however, saliva from the test group killed sm by more than  two logs (p <0.05). no effect was seen on aa. the saliva from the aa-negative group killed aa by two logs (p <0.05). no effect was seen on sm. conclusion: aa-positive subjects had a salivary factor that significantly reduced survival of sm, which may help to explain the fact that this group typically has minimal proximal decay.

TI  == caries-related plaque microcosm biofilms developed in microplates.
AB  == in vivo dental plaque biofilms consist of complex communities of oral bacteria that are a challenge to replicate in vitro. the aim of this investigation was to  establish human dental plaque microcosms in microplates to reflect conditions that are relevant to dental caries. microcosm plaque biofilms were initiated from the saliva of two different donors, grown for up to 10 days in 24-welled microplates on thermanox coverslips in various types of artificial saliva with and without sucrose, which were replaced daily. microbiota composition of 40 species associated with oral health and dental caries was monitored in the plaques using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization analysis. ph was measured as an  indicator of cariogenic potential. the composition of the saliva inocula was different, and yielded plaque microcosms with different composition and growth responses to sucrose. artificial saliva type and presence of sucrose, and the resulting growth and ph conditions, modified the growth of individual species and hence the ecological profile of the microplate plaques during development. complex population shifts were observed during development, and older plaques comprised predominantly facultative anaerobic species. sucrose supplementation limited the decline of streptococci over time but did not increase the abundance  of mutans streptococci. sucrose at 0.15% increased levels of caries-associated species including lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus acidophilus and actinomyces gerensceriae; these were further increased with sucrose at 0.5%, in addition to actinomyces israelii, rothia dentocariosa and capnocytophaga gingivalis. the microplate plaques demonstrated complex community dynamics that appeared to reflect the maturation of natural plaques, and sucrose induced a cariogenic plaque composition and ph.

TI  == expression of the short fimbriae of porphyromonas gingivalis is regulated in oral bacterial consortia.
AB  == the mfa1 protein of porphyromonas gingivalis is the structural subunit of the short fimbriae and mediates coadhesion between p. gingivalis and streptococcus gordonii. we utilized a promoter-lacz reporter construct to examine the regulation of mfa1 expression in consortia with common oral plaque bacteria. promoter activity of mfa1 was inhibited by s. gordonii, streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus mitis. in contrast, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus cristatus, actinomyces naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum did not affect mfa1 expression. expression of sspa/b, the streptococcal receptor for mfa1, was not required for regulation of mfa1 promoter activity. proteinaceous molecule(s) in oral streptococci may be responsible for regulation of mfa1 expression. porphyromonas gingivalis is capable of detecting heterologous organisms, and responds to selected organisms by specific gene regulation.

TI  == oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health: species composition and antimicrobial activity.
AB  == background/aims: lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. however, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. we aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative  oral pathogens. methods: a total of 238 lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. in all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia was assessed. results: lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. the most prevalent strains in healthy persons were lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, lactobacillus plantarum. obligately homofermentatives, particularly l. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for l. gasseri, p < 0.01). sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited s. mutans, 88% a. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% p. gingivalis and 65% p. intermedia. the strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with lactobacillus paracasei, l. plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus salivarius. the strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against s. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. conclusion: the composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly l. gasseri, in the latter group. both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.

TI  == a searchable database for proteomes of oral microorganisms.
AB  == an online database of proteomes for two-dimensional electrophoresis (2de) gel data was constructed and it is now freely accessible through a web-based interface. proteins from three oral bacteria, streptococcus mutans ua159, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans hk1651, and porphyromonas gingivalis w83, whose genome databases are freely available, were separated by 2de, and protein spots were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (maldi-tof) and identified. about 1000 spots from the gels of p. gingivalis w83 were extracted and analyzed by maldi-tof, and 330 proteins were identified. in addition, 160 of 240 spots of a. actinomycetemcomitans and 158 of 356 spots of s. mutans were identified. information such as spot coordinates on the gels, protein names (predicted functions), molecular weights, isoelectroric points, and links to online databases, including oral pathogen sequence databases of the los alamos national laboratory bioscience division (oralgen) and national center for biotechnology information (ncbi) or the institute genomic research (tigr), were stored in tables accessible through the relational database management system mysql on an apache web server. to test for functionality of this database system, responses of s. mutans to environmental changes were analyzed using the database  and 21 spots on the gel were identified as proteins whose expression had been increased or decreased by environmental ph change without in-gel trypsin digestion, protein extraction, or maldi-tof/tof-ms (mass spectrometer) analysis.  the identified proteins are agreement with those reported in previous papers on acid tolerance of s. mutans, demonstrating the usefulness of the system. this database is available at http://www.myamagu.dent.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~bioinformatics/index.html or http://www.bipos.mascat.nihon-u.ac.jp/index.html.

TI  == attachment of periodontal ligament cells onto various antibiotics-loaded gtr membranes.
AB  == this study compared the natures of various guided tissue regeneration (gtr) membranes impregnated with amoxicillin or tetracycline. whether the antibiotics-loaded membranes enhance the attachment of the periodontal ligament cells in the presence of oral pathogens was further analyzed. s mutans and a actinomycetemcomitans diminished the attachment of periodontal ligament cells onto the membranes as evaluated by sem analysis. these bacterial effects on cellular attachment could be reversed using the antibiotics-loaded membranes. the information obtained in this study is valuable for the future application of antibiotics-loaded membranes during gtr therapy.

TI  == effectiveness of a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice on microbiological and inflammatory parameters.
AB  == according to the us surgeon general's report, "oral health in america," published in 2000, most adults in the united states show some degree of periodontal pathology, with severe periodontal diseases affecting about 14% of middle-aged adults. periodontal diseases are polymicrobial-induced inflammatory diseases, and they vary from mild gingival inflammation to severe deterioration of the periodontium, ie, loss of periodontal supportive tissues and, ultimately, tooth loss. new evidence shows that periodontal diseases may impact systemic health. for this reason, the maintenance of a healthy mouth is becoming increasingly important for the overall health of the body. this article summarizes laboratory  research conducted during the development of a novel, multibenefit, oral-care technology based on triclosan--a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent--and a polyvinylmethylether/maleic acid copolymer. this unique combination of agents is  found in colgate total, a clinically proven efficacious dentifrice for control of dental plaque and gingivitis. data are presented that demonstrate the unique antibacterial properties of this dentifrice: (1) a broad-spectrum antimicrobial profile; (2) the long-lasting retention of triclosan on hydroxyapatite and epithelial cells; and (3) molecular evidence of antibacterial activity against specific pathogens in clinical dental plaque. in addition, data are presented that demonstrate the anti-inflammatory effects of triclosan on specific cytokines, the interruption of inflammatory pathways, and the inhibition of bone  resorption. overall, these data support the multibenefit clinical effects of colgate total and suggest a plurality of mechanisms of action.

TI  == efficacy of ozone on survival and permeability of oral microorganisms.
AB  == in the present study, we examined the effect of ozonated water on oral microorganisms and dental plaque. almost no microorganisms were detected after being treated with ozonated water (4 mg/l) for 10 s. to estimate the ozonated water-treated streptococcus mutans, bacterial cells were stained with live/dead baclight bacterial viability kit. fluorescence microscopic analysis revealed that s. mutans cells were killed instantaneously in ozonated water. some breakage of ozonated water-treated s. mutans was found by electron microscopy. when the experimental dental plaque was exposed to ozonated water, the number of viable s. mutans remarkably decreased. ozonated water strongly inhibited the accumulation of experimental dental plaque in vitro. after the dental plaque samples from human subjects were exposed to ozonated water in vitro, almost no viable bacterial cells were detected. these results suggest that ozonated water should be useful in reducing the infections caused by oral microorganisms in dental plaque.

TI  == a comparison of the antibacterial efficacies of essential oils against oral pathogens.
AB  == cariogenic bacteria and periodontopathic bacteria are present in dental plaque as biofilms. in this study, we investigated the antibacterial effects of essential oils on the following oral bacteria: porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sobrinus. we tested manuka oil, tea tree oil, eucalyptus oil, lavandula oil, and romarinus oil and determined their minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration. the essential oils inhibited the growth of the bacteria tested, manuka oil being the most effective. minimum bactericidal concentration values showed that lavandula oil acts bacteriostatically, and the remaining oils, bactericidally. periodontopathic bacterial strains tested were killed completely by exposure for 30 s to 0.2% manuka oil, tea tree oil or eucalyptus oil. tea tree oil and manuka oil showed significant adhesion-inhibiting activity against p. gingivalis. all the essential oils tested inhibited the adhesion of s. mutans. this study showed that, among the essential oils tested, manuka oil and tea tree oil in particular had strong antibacterial activity against periodontopathic and cariogenic bacteria. from the viewpoint of safety, we also examined the effects of these essential oils on cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells and found that, at a concentration of 0.2%, they had little effect on cultured cells.

TI  == a rapid procedure to ascertain the antimicrobial efficacy of oral care formulations.
AB  == a rapid method examining the antimicrobial efficacy of oral care formulations with alamar blue, an oxidation-reduction dye with fluorescent end-points, is described. significant correlations between increasing viable plate counts of the oral bacteria actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and increased alamar fluorescence were noted. metabolically active bacteria reduced alamar with the reduced dye found in the cell-free filtrate. insignificant alamar reductions were noted in the absence of bacteria or by spent culture supernatants. the efficacy of mouthrinses with clinically proven antiplaque agents such as chlorhexidine or cetylpyridinium chloride were determined by alamar blue. in a model system with a. viscosus, triclosan dentifrices demonstrate a dose-dependent effect on bacteria. human salivary bacteria demonstrate increasing alamar fluorescence with increasing plate counts. a clinical study examined the effects of rinsing with chlorhexidine or cetylpyridinium chloride mouthrinses in comparison with a placebo mouthrinse and water on salivary bacteria. rinsing with chlorhexidine resulted in the least  number of bacteria by alamar and plate count methods. in summary, the current study demonstrates the utility of alamar blue to examine the antimicrobial effects of oral care formulations in laboratory and clinical studies.

TI  == susceptibility of oral bacteria to an antimicrobial decapeptide.
AB  == naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides have emerged as alternative classes of antimicrobials. in general, these antimicrobial peptides exhibit selectivity for  prokaryotes and minimize the problems of engendering microbial resistance. as an  alternative method to search for more effective broad-spectrum peptide antimicrobials, investigators have developed peptide libraries by using synthetic combinatorial technology. a novel decapeptide, kkvvfkvkfk (ksl), has been identified that shows a broad range of antibacterial activity. the purpose of this study was to test the efficacy of this antimicrobial peptide in killing selected strains of oral pathogens and resident saliva bacteria collected from human subjects. cytotoxic activity of ksl against mammalian cells and the structural features of this decapeptide were also investigated, the latter by using two-dimensional nmr in aqueous and dmso solutions. mics of ksl for the majority of oral bacteria tested in vitro ranged from 3 to 100 microg ml(-1). minimal bactericidal concentrations of ksl were, in general, within one to two dilutions of the mics. ksl exhibited an ed(99) (the dose at which 99 % killing was observed after 15 min at 37 degrees c) of 6.25 microg ml(-1) against selected strains of lactobacillus salivarius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus gordonii and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. in addition, ksl damaged bacterial cell membranes and caused 1.05 log units reduction of viability counts of saliva bacteria. in vitro toxicity studies showed that ksl, at concentrations up to 1 mg ml(-1), did not induce cell death or compromise the membrane integrity of human gingival fibroblasts. nmr studies suggest that ksl adopts an alpha-helical structure in dmso solution, which mimics the polar aprotic membrane environment,  whereas it remains unstructured in aqueous medium. this study shows that ksl may  be a useful antimicrobial agent for inhibiting the growth of oral bacteria that are associated with caries development and early plaque formation.

TI  == one of two human lactoferrin variants exhibits increased antibacterial and transcriptional activation activities and is associated with localized juvenile periodontitis.
AB  == the iron-binding protein lactoferrin is a ubiquitous and abundant constituent of  human exocrine secretions. lactoferrin inhibits bacterial growth by sequestering  essential iron and also exhibits non-iron-dependent antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and immunoregulatory activities. all of  these non-iron-dependent activities are mediated by the highly charged n terminus of lactoferrin. in this study we characterized a lys/arg polymorphism at position 29 in the n-terminal region of human lactoferrin that results from a single nucleotide polymorphism in exon 1 of the human lactoferrin gene. we expressed cdnas encoding both lactoferrin variants in insect cells and purified the two proteins by ion exchange chromatography. the two lactoferrin variants exhibited nearly identical iron-binding and iron-releasing activities and equivalent bactericidal activities against a strain of the gram-negative bacterium actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. when tested against the gram-positive species streptococcus mutans and streptococcus mitis, however, lactoferrin containing lys at position 29 exhibited significantly greater bactericidal activity than did lactoferrin containing arg. in addition, the lys-containing lactoferrin stimulated bovine tracheal epithelial cells to synthesize much higher levels of tracheal antimicrobial peptide mrna than did the arg-containing variant. a genotyping assay that distinguished between the two alleles based on a polymorphic eari restriction site showed that the lys and arg alleles had frequencies of 24% and 76%, respectively, among 17 healthy human subjects, and 72% and 28%, respectively, among nine patients with localized juvenile periodontitis. our findings suggest that these two lactoferrin variants are functionally different and that these differences may contribute to the pathogenesis of localized juvenile periodontitis.

TI  == antibacterial activity of synthetic human b defensin-2 against periodontal bacteria.
AB  == the oral epithelium is continuously exposed to a variety of microbial challenges  that can cause infectious diseases such as periodontal disease. human b defensin-2 (hbd-2) is a cationic antimicrobial peptide with low molecular weight, which is inducible from oral epithelial cells upon either bacterial infection or  stimulation with inflammatory cytokines. this peptide has a broad antimicrobial spectrum that includes gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and fungi. therefore, it is thought that hbd-2 plays an important role as one of natural immunities to bacterial infection. however, its activity is inhibited by body fluids such as serum. the aim of this study was to assess the antibacterial activity of synthetic hbd-2 against oral bacteria in the presence of saliva or serum. the antibacterial activity of synthetic hbd-2 was tested against actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus mutans, and escherichia coli. antibacterial broth assay and diffusion assay were  performed in vitro. the antibacterial activity of hbd-2 was approximately equal to that of minocycline at equimolar concentrations. furthermore, the activity of  hbd-2 remained at 60% in the presence of 80% saliva, whereas no activity remained in the presence of 20% serum. our results suggest the possibility that synthetic  hbd-2 could be useful to prevent infection by periodontal bacteria.

AB  == the effects of safrole on the defensive functions of human neutrophils were examined. at the concentrations employed in this study, safrole did not significantly affect the viability of peripheral blood neutrophils as verified by their ability to exclude trypan blue dye. however, exposure of neutrophils to safrole inhibited their bactericidal activity against oral pathogens, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans, in a dose dependent manner. in addition, safrole inhibited the production of bactericidal superoxide anion by neutrophils as measured by cytochrome c reduction. in conclusion, the results demonstrated that safrole reduced the antibacterial activity and the superoxide anion production of neutrophils. inhibition of the defensive functions of neutrophils may be one possible mechanism by which safrole compromises the oral health.

TI  == permeability of streptococcus mutans and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans through guided tissue regeneration membranes and their effects on attachment of periodontal ligament cells.
AB  == background: microbial colonization on barrier materials used in guided tissue regeneration (gtr) may adversely affect treatment outcomes. the purposes of this  study were: 1) to compare the invasion of streptococcus mutans and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans through 3 gtr membranes, composed of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (eptfe; non-resorbable), a glycolide fiber composite, and type i collagen (both bioabsorbable), and 2) to explore the effects of bacteria on the attachment of periodontal ligament (pdl) fibroblasts onto these membranes. methods: bacterial permeability was analyzed using a tube capped with a gtr membrane as a septum and filled with media. the tube was then placed in a bigger  tube inoculated with s. mutans or a. actinomycetemcomitans. the passage of bacteria through the membranes into the inner tube was monitored. for cellular attachment experiments, primary human pdl cells were placed onto the gtr membranes with or without bacteria. attached cells were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (sem) analysis. results: the eptfe membrane had the best barrier effects followed by the collagen membrane and then the glycolide fiber composite membrane. moreover, s. mutans passed through these membranes faster than a. actinomycetemcomitans. the attachment of pdl cells on the 3 membranes was also varied. the eptfe membrane was the worst substrate for pdl fibroblast attachment. moreover, both bacteria influenced the cellular attachment on the gtr membranes. conclusions: differences in the behavior of 3 gtr membranes penetrated by s. mutans and a. actinomycetemcomitans were demonstrated. the results suggest  that attachment of pdl cells was affected on bacterial-contaminated gtr membranes, which may alter healing following membrane exposure.

TI  == microbial profile on metallic and ceramic bracket materials.
AB  == the placement of orthodontic appliances creates a favorable environment for the accumulation of a microbiota and food residues, which, in time, may cause caries  or exacerbate any pre-existing periodontal disease. the purpose of the present study was to compare the total bacterial counts present on metallic and ceramic orthodontic brackets in order to clarify which bracket type has a higher plaque retaining capacity and to determine the levels of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus spp on both types of brackets. thirty-two metallic brackets and 24  ceramic brackets were collected from orthodontic patients at the day of debonding. two brackets were collected from each patient; one from a maxillary central incisor and another from a maxillary second premolar. sixteen patients who used metallic brackets and 12 patients who used ceramic brackets were sampled. bacterial populations were studied using "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization, which uses dna probes to identify species in complex microbial samples. the significance of differences between groups was determined using the  mann-whitney u-test. results showed no significant differences between metallic and ceramic brackets with respect to the caries-inducing s mutans and l acidophilus spp counts. mean counts of 8 of 35 additional species differed significantly between metallic and ceramic brackets with no obvious pattern favoring one bracket type over the other. this study showed higher mean counts of treponema denticola, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii, streptococcus anginosus, and eubacterium nodatum on metallic brackets while higher counts of eikenella corrodens, campylobacter showae, and selenomonas noxia were found on ceramic brackets.

TI  == simultaneous measurement of the viability, aggregation, and live and dead adherence of streptococcus crista, streptococcus mutans and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in human saliva in relation to indices of caries, dental plaque and periodontal disease.
AB  == salivary proteins have multiple functions and many share similar functions, which may be why it has been difficult to relate variations in their concentrations to  oral health and ecology. an alternative is to focus on variations in the major functions of saliva. an hydroxyapatite-coated microplate model has been developed that simultaneously measures saliva-promoted bacterial viability, bacterial aggregation, and live and dead bacterial adherence, while simulating oral temperature and shearing forces from swallowing. that model was applied to resting whole and stimulated parotid saliva from 149 individuals, using representative strains of streptococcus crista, s. mutans, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. two major factors were defined by multivariate analysis (this was successful only for whole-saliva). one factor was correlated with aggregation, live adherence and dead adherence for all three strains; the other was correlated with total viability of all three strains. participants were grouped <25th percentile and >75th percentile for each factor. those groups were  compared for clinical indices of oral health. caries scores were significantly lower in those with high scores for aggregation-adherence, regardless of whether  total viability scores were low or high. live bacteria always predominated on surfaces when live and dead adherence scores were expressed as ratios. however, participants with high scores for aggregation-adherence showed significantly more dead adherent bacteria than those with low scores (these ratios were uncorrelated with total viability). this finding may indicate that extreme differences in the  ability to kill bacteria on surfaces can influence caries risk.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the in vitro antibacterial activity of  a chitooligosaccharide mixture (mw 2000-30000 da) with a deacetylation degree of  91.5% against two representative oral pathogens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans. a 0.1% concentration of the chitooligosaccharides (derived from the exoskeletons of marine crustaceans) was used to estimate antibacterial activity. approximately 2 logcolony forming units  (cfu)/ml of a. actinomycetemcomitans were inactivated by 0.1% chitosan after 30 min, while 120 min exposure inactivated about 4.5 logcfu/ml of this organism. in  contrast, the level of inactivation against s. mutans was less than 0.5 logcfu/ml after an exposure of up to 120 min. electron microscopy showed that the exposure  of a. actinomycetemcomitans to the chitooligosaccharides resulted in the disruption of cell membranes and that it could be considered for the treatment of periodontal diseases associated with a. actinomycetemcomitans.

TI  == efficacy of manual and powered toothbrushes (ii). effect on microbiological parameters.
AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (crest  complete) or power (braun 3d plaque remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. methods: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. at baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their  content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. after random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush  (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the mann-whitney test. results: mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. major reductions occurred in both groups for a. naeslundii, a. israelii/gerencseriae, peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis and s. constellatus/intermedius. all taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. the reductions in prevalence were greater for a. naeslundii, s. constellatus/intermedius, v. parvula, a. israelii/gerencseriae, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis, p. micros, streptococcus mutans and p. intermedia/nigrescens. mean prevalence was decreased more for porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus/showae, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. conclusions: the major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the  subgingival microbiota. counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. this reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.

TI  == mutans streptococci in subgingival plaque of treated and untreated patients with  periodontitis.
AB  == background: the etiology of root caries is thought to be identical to coronal caries, though root caries seem to be more complicated because of the higher susceptibility of exposed roots (dentin) by periodontal therapy to demineralization than intact enamel. this implies that mutans streptococci are the most likely pathogens in the development of root caries. although it is known that both the numbers of mutans streptococci and the frequency of isolation in root caries lesions are negatively correlated with the distance from the gingival margin, the subgingival sulcus has not been considered a possible habitat for mutans streptococci. however, subgingival occurrence of mutans streptococci in both untreated and treated periodontal patients has not been documented well in the literature. objective: to investigate the presence and levels of mutans streptococci in the subgingival plaque of patients (n=154) in different stages of periodontal therapy. the subgingival sulcus may be a possible habitat for mutans  streptococci. this localisation of mutans streptococci may be of importance in the development of root caries after periodontal surgery. materials and methods:  in this cross-sectional study, subgingival plaque samples from 154 consecutive adult periodontitis patients were tested for presence and levels of mutans streptococci and putative periodontal pathogens by anaerobic cultures. these patients were divided into 4 groups based on their stage of periodontal treatment: (1) untreated patients; (2) patients after initial periodontal therapy only; (3) patients in the maintenance phase who not underwent periodontal surgery; (4) patients after periodontal surgery. results: the prevalence of mutans streptococci in the 4 study groups varied from 82% in untreated patients to 94% in maintenance patients. the mean proportion of mutans streptococci was 6.65% in maintenance patients versus 1.86% in untreated patients (p=0.005) and 2.51% in patients after scaling and root planing (p=0.041). conclusions: the subgingival area is a microbial habitat for mutans streptococci that may be of importance in the development of root caries in periodontitis patients.

TI  == move of adults with mental retardation from institutions to community-based living: changes in the oral microbiological flora.
AB  == in the western world, the policy of deinstitutionalization and integration of individuals with mental retardation is generally accepted. we tested the hypothesis that de-institutionalization may lead to changes of habits with a potential to influence oral health. when 57 adults with mental retardation moved  from an institution to community-based living, their oral hygiene habits, gingival bleeding, and a three-day food record were registered one month before and 9 and 21 months after the move. mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in saliva, p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, p. gingivalis, and a. actinomycetemcomitans  in supragingival plaque, and c. albicans on mucous membranes were analyzed. after 21 months of community-based living, fewer persons showed high classes of mutans  streptococci, growth of p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, and high frequency of sucrose intake, and more subjects showed growth of c. albicans. in a short perspective, the indicators of oral diseases suggest an unchanged or lower risk of oral diseases after the de-institutionalization of individuals with moderate or severe mental retardation.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of silver nitrate against periodontal pathogens.
AB  == metal ions were evaluated as potential antimicrobial agents suitable for local delivery in the oral cavity for the treatment of periodontitis. silver nitrate, copper chloride, and zinc chloride were tested for antimicrobial activity in in vitro killing assays conducted in phosphate buffered saline with a series of oral bacteria including gram-negative periodontal pathogens and gram-positive streptococci. copper and zinc salts failed to exhibit strong and consistent activity against periodontal pathogens. in contrast, silver at a concentration of 0.5 microg/ml produced a 3 log10 reduction in colony forming units (cfu)/ml or greater against all periodontal pathogens tested including porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella denticola, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum vincentii, campylobacter gracilis, campylobacter rectus,  eikenella corrodens, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. in comparison, substantially higher concentrations of silver nitrate failed to kill oral streptococci. a silver nitrate concentration of 25 microg/ml produced log10 reductions in cfu/ml of 3.5-5 in killing assays performed in human serum against  p. gingivalis, demonstrating the ability of silver to retain activity in a biological medium similar to that encountered in vivo in the periodontal pocket.  these results identify silver nitrate, an antimicrobial that may possess advantages over traditional antibiotics, as a potential agent for controlled release local delivery in the oral cavity for the treatment of periodontitis.

TI  == studies on oral health in mentally retarded adults.
AB  == during the last decades, a new policy involving normalisation, integration, equality and deinstitutionalisation of mentally retarded (mr) individuals has been accepted in sweden. consequently, many institutions have been closed and an  increased number of people with mr are now integrated into the swedish community. the general aim of this thesis was to investigate if a greater degree of independence for mr adults influenced the prevalence of oral diseases. material and methods: the caries incidence and prevalence, number of remaining teeth, incidence of tooth mortality and interproximal bone loss were investigated in a group of mr adults, aged 21-40 years, all with protracted, regular preventive dental care. the studied variables were related to living arrangements and degree of mr, and were followed during 8.5 years (papers i, ii and vi). incidence and reasons for tooth mortality were studied during 10 years in institutionalised mr  individuals (paper iii). in connection with the closing-down of an institution for mr adults, the changes of oral hygiene habits, sucrose intake and oral microbiological flora were studied in the new integrated living (papers iv and v). results: less restrictive living arrangements and mild forms of mr were correlated to a high caries prevalence in persons with mr. after 8.5 years, the caries incidence had decreased in all subjects, but persons with mild mr and those who lived integrated still had a higher caries prevalence than other mr adults. with the exception of subjects with down syndrome, the interproximal bone loss during 8.5 years was similar or lower compared to normal swedish populations. institutionalised mr subjects had lost an average of 3.72 teeth during 10 years. periodontitis was the main reason for tooth mortality. persons who cooperated well with dental treatment and those who used neuroleptics lost fewer teeth during the 10-year period compared to other mr individuals. the proportion of subjects with high levels of mutans streptococci and subjects who showed growth of p. intermedia/p. nigrescens decreased after deinstitutionalisation, and less subjects consumed sucrose frequently. the oral hygiene routines, and the levels of lactobacilli, p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans were not influenced by the change in living arrangements. a simplified saliva sampling method, involving licking directly on the bacteria culture, was developed to count lactobacilli in saliva when delivering whole saliva was impossible. conclusions: less restrictive living and a mild degree of  mr were correlated to a high caries prevalence. subjects with poor ability to cooperate with dental treatment and those with down syndrome have an obvious risk of deteriorated oral health. however, compared to normal swedish populations, the mr subjects studied in this thesis had, after several years of regular dental care, satisfactory oral health.

TI  == effects of areca nut extracts on the functions of human neutrophils in vitro.
AB  == aqueous extracts of ripe areca nut without husk (ripe ane) and fresh and tender areca nut with husk (tender ane) were examined for their effects on the defensive functions of human neutrophils. exposure of peripheral blood neutrophils to ripe  ane and tender ane inhibited their bactericidal activity against oral pathogens,  including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans, in a dose-dependent manner. at the concentrations tested, ripe and tender anes did not significantly affect the viability of neutrophils as verified by their ability to exclude trypan blue dye. however, both anes inhibited the production of bactericidal superoxide anion by neutrophils as measured by cytochrome c reduction. moreover, the ripe ane inhibited neutrophils more effectively than did tender ane. arecoline, a major alkaloid of areca nut, only exhibited an inhibitory effect on the functions of neutrophils when high concentrations were used. therefore, arecoline could not be used to explain the inhibitory effects observed for anes. in conclusion, our results demonstrated that ripe and tender anes reduced the antibacterial activity and the superoxide anion production of neutrophils. this effect may contribute to a less efficient elimination of bacteria from the periodontal environment. inhibition of the antimicrobial functions of neutrophils may alter the microbial ecology of the oral cavity, and  this may be one possible mechanism by which areca nut compromises the oral health of users of areca nut products.

TI  == large-scale synthesis and functional elements for the antimicrobial activity of defensins.
AB  == human neutrophil defensins, and their analogues incorporating anionic, hydrophobic or cationic residues at the n- and c-termini, were synthesized by solid-phase procedures. the synthetic defensins were examined for their microbicidal activity against candida albicans, two gram-negative bacteria (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis) and two gram-positive bacteria (streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mutans). the human neutrophil peptide 1 (hnp1) and hnp2 were found to be potent candidacidal agents. hnp3, which differs by one amino acid at the n-terminus of its sequence,  was totally inactive. the gram-negative bacteria a. actinomycetemcomitans and p.  gingivalis and the gram-positive bacteria s. gordonii and s. mutans were insensitive to human defensins. however, the insertion of two basic residues, such as arginine, at both the n-terminus and the c-terminus of hnp2 significantly enhanced antifungal and antibacterial activity. the addition of anionic residues, such as aspartic acid, at the n- and c-termini rendered the molecule totally inactive. the presence of two hydrophobic amino acids, such as valine, at the n-terminus of hnp2 and of two basic arginine residues at its c-terminus resulted  in molecules that were optimally active against these oral pathogens. the results suggest that the n- and c-terminal residues in defensin peptides are the crucial  functional elements that determine their microbicidal potency. the three-dimensional structure of all defensins constitutes the same amphiphilic beta-sheet structure, with the polar face formed by the n- and c-terminal residues playing an important role in defining microbicidal potency and the antimicrobial spectrum. the enhanced microbicidal activity observed for defensin  peptides with two basic residues at both the n- and c-termini could be due to optimization of the amphiphilicity of the structure, which could facilitate specific interactions with the microbial membranes.

TI  == synthesis, microbicidal activity, and solution structure of the dodecapeptide from bovine neutrophils.
AB  == the dodecapepetide sequence r-l-c-r-i-v-v-i-r-v-c-r with a disulfide bridge between the cysteine residues found in bovine neutrophils was synthesized by solid-phase procedures. its antimicrobial activity against oral microorganisms such as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus gordonii was examined, and its structural features were examined by cd and determined by two-dimensional (2d) nmr. the strains p. gingivalis (w50 and 381), a. actinomycetemcomitans (y4 and 67), s. gordonii (dl1), and s. mutans (gs5) are found to be highly sensitive to this peptide at 2-2.5 microm concentrations, suggesting that the dodecapeptide is a potent antibiotic for oral pathogens. the weak negative n-sigma* band observed at approximately 265-270 nm in the cd spectra of this peptide provides evidence for  the presence of a disulfide bridge. the negative n-pi* band at approximately 200  nm and the positive pi-pi* band at 185 nm suggest a folded structure for this peptide. the negative n-pi* shifts from 200 to 206 nm with an increase in intensity in dipalmitoylphosphotidylcholine vesicles, suggesting that the peptide might associate to form higher order aggregates in lipid medium. the assignment of backbone and side-chain proton resonances has been accomplished by the combined analysis of 2d total correlated and nuclear overhauser effect spectroscopy. the temperature dependence of amide nh chemical shifts and (1)h-(2)h exchange effect on amide nh resonances indicate the involvement of amide nh groups of cys3, ile5, ile8, val10, and arg12 in intramolecular hydrogen  bonding. the coupling constant (j(nh-c(alpha)h)) values, the set of medium-, short-, and long-range nuclear overhauser effects, and the results of restrained  structure calculation using the distance geometry algorithm for nmr applications  provide evidence for a folded, loop-like structure with a type i (iii) beta-turn  involving ile5, val6, val7, and ile8, and two antiparallel beta-strands involving the n-terminal arg1, leu2, cys3, and val4 and the c-terminal arg9, val10, cys11,  and arg12 residues. the structure of the dodecapeptide mimics the amphiphilic structure of large 30-35 residue defensins and the peptide appears to exhibit similar antimicrobial potency.

TI  == periodontal findings and systemic antibody responses to oral microorganisms in behcet's disease.
AB  == background: behcet's disease is a multisystem disorder of unknown etiology, affecting predominantly the oral mucosa, skin, and eyes. recurrent and painful episodes of oral ulcerations interfere with regular oral hygiene leading to rapid bacterial plaque accumulation. the aims of this study were to evaluate the periodontal status of patients with behcet's disease and determine serum antibody responses to selected oral microorganisms, including major periodontopathogens in these patients. methods: thirty-three patients with behcet's disease and 15 healthy subjects were included in the study. plaque, sulcular bleeding, periodontal index scores, probing depths, and total number of teeth were recorded. serum igg antibody levels to a panel of 13 oral microorganisms were determined. results: significantly higher values for each of the clinical measures were observed in patients with behcet's disease compared to healthy subjects (p <0.0001). antibody levels to selected members of plaque, including actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus  oralis, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus, and prevotella intermedia were significantly lower in patients with behcet's disease than in controls (p <0.001-0.05). in contrast, these patients exhibited significantly elevated antibody levels to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4 compared to controls (p <0.01). conclusions: our data indicate that the patients with behcet's disease generally exhibit clinical findings of established periodontal disease. decreased antibody responses to early colonizers of both supra- and subgingival plaque were observed along with the elevation in antibody levels to a. actinomycetemcomitans. these results suggest that the bacterial plaque ecology and/or immune responses to these microorganisms may be affected in behcet's disease which could lead to changes in the expression of periodontal disease.

TI  == bacteriostatic effects of hyaluronic acid.
AB  == background: this investigation is one of a series of projects seeking to ascertain whether hyaluronic acid (ha) is therapeutically effective in tissue regeneration procedures. the rationale for these investigations is to test the hypothesis that ha can serve as a bioabsorbable carrier for other substrates as well as itself actively promote the regeneration of tissue. methods: in this paper, we report on the bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties of 3 molecular weight formulations of recombinant ha (low, 141 kd; medium, 757 kd; and high, 1,300 kd) on selected oral and non-oral microorganisms in the planktonic phase. three concentrations of each ha formulation were screened, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/ml, using a standard broth culture assay. results: recombinant ha exerted varied bacteriostatic effects on all the bacterial strains tested depending on its molecular weight (mw) and concentration. the high concentrations of the medium mw ha had the greatest bacteriostatic effect, particularly on the actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella oris, staphylococcus aureus, and propionibacterium acnes strains. the 1.0 mg/ml concentration of high mw ha had the greatest overall bacteriostatic effect, inhibiting the growth of all 6 bacterial strains tested. among the bacterial strains studied, ha was found to have no bactericidal effects, regardless of concentration or molecular weight. conclusions: the results of this study suggest that ha in the mw range of 1,300 kd may prove beneficial in minimizing bacterial contamination of surgical wounds  when used in guided tissue regeneration surgery.

TI  == antibacterial effects of a bioactive glass paste on oral microorganisms.
AB  == bioactive glasses contain oxides of calcium, sodium, phosphorus, and silicon in a proportion that provides the material with surface activity and concomitantly with the property of forming a strong bond with bone. bioactive glasses have been tested as bone substitutes in different clinical situations. in an aqueous environment, ca2+, na+, po4(3-) , and si4+ are released from the glass, resulting in a rise in ph and in osmotic pressure in its vicinity. since these are factors  that potentially influence the viability of oral microorganisms at the dentogingival margin, we studied the effects of bioactive glass s53p4 on the oral microorganisms actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sanguis. this was done by incubating each microbe in a suspension, in the presence of bioactive glass s53p4 in powder form. a. naeslundii was found to lose its viability within  10 min under the experimental conditions. a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and s. mutans lost their viability within 60 min. also for s. sanguis a significant loss of viability was seen within 60 min, but it was the only microbe that had any viable cells left after 60 min. thus, in aqueous solutions the powdered bioactive glass s53p4 appears to have a broad antimicrobial effect on microorganisms of both supra- and subgingival plaque. consequently, it could be useful as an ingredient in tooth-care products that may have beneficial effects on oral health both from a cariologic and a periodontal point of view.

AB  == levels of total iga and specific iga reactive with streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and fusobacterium nucleatum were measured by elisa in parotid saliva from hiv+ and hiv- persons with healthy gingiva (hg), chronic gingivitis, chronic marginal periodontitis (cmp), or necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis (nup). when the hiv+ group was compared with the hiv- group regardless of periodontal status, total salivary iga concentration was higher in hiv+ patients, but no such difference was observed for total iga output. hiv+ cmp displayed higher total iga concentration as compared with hiv- cmp. no significant differences in specific iga outputs and ratios were detected  between hiv+ and hiv- subgroups with similar periodontal status. hiv+ nup displayed increased specific iga output towards s. mutans and increased specific  iga ratio values towards s. mutans, p. gingivalis and p. nigrescens as compared with hiv+ cmp, and increased specific iga ratio values towards s. mutans and p. nigrescens as compared with hiv+ hg. no such differences were observed between the hiv- subgroups. in sum, salivary iga responses to bacteria in dental plaque seem not to be related to chronic periodontal disease and hiv infection, but are  possibly influenced by acute periodontal infection.

AB  == the present study compared the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization methodology with culture techniques for the analysis of the composition of the subgingival microbiota. 70 subjects, presenting with a variety of periodontal conditions, contributed with a total of 283 subgingival plaque samples analyzed with respect  to the following species: porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus,  eikenella corrodens, bacteroides forsythus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mutans. species identification and quantification was performed by (i) the checkerboard method, using whole genomic, digoxigenin labeled dna probes; and (ii) culture, including non-selective and selective media in combination with routine biochemical testing using commercial  test panels. we found that the checkerboard technology resulted in higher prevalence figures for half of the species tested when compared to culture data.  if the latter were used as the reference, checkerboard detection sensitivities ranged from 0.17 to 0.86, specificities from 0.17 to 1.0, and diagnostic accuracies from 0.51 to 0.81, depending on bacterial species. the use of the checkerboard data as the reference resulted in detection sensitivities for the culture procedures between 0.24 and 1.0 and specificities between 0.21 and 0.87.  the checkerboard methodology resulted in statistically significant higher bacterial counts for the majority of the species. it was further observed that, for most species, the higher the total number colony-forming units in the sample, the higher the discrepancy between the results obtained by the two techniques.

TI  == bacterial adherence to guided tissue regeneration barrier membranes exposed to the oral environment.
AB  == microbial colonization of barrier materials used in guided tissue regeneration (gtr) is known to adversely affect treatment outcomes. the purpose of this study  was to compare the rate at which 11 commonly-occurring oral bacteria species colonize three different barrier materials (collagen, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, and polylactic acid). the study group consisted of 10 systemically healthy individuals with no history of periodontal disease and absence of antimicrobial therapy within the previous 3 months. in each patient, 4 teeth per quadrant (p1, p2, m1, m2) were selected and 3 teeth were randomly assigned as test teeth while the remaining tooth acted as a control site (i.e., natural colonization of the tooth surface). these teeth were then randomly assigned to receive one of the three barrier types (i.e., each patient received 4 barriers of each type, 1 per quadrant). a 2 x 5 mm piece of barrier material was  positioned over the oral surface of the buccal marginal gingiva and secured with  an external sling suture. with oral hygiene procedures suspended, one barrier of  each type was collected at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. slot immunoblot assay demonstrated that all species types (a. actinomycetemcomitans, a. viscosus, b. melaninogenicus, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, s. mutans, s. sanguis, selenomonas sputigena, t. denticola, and t. vincentii) were present. semi-quantitative scoring (scale 0 to 3) of slot blot results and analysis by chi-square ratio and pearson correlation test indicated that while total bacteria adherence increased over time (p < 0.05), the 3 barrier types and the control sites did not differ in numbers or species of colonizing bacteria detected per time point. these results suggest that under these experimental conditions the barrier materials tested do not differ in bacteria adherence or antimicrobial properties.

TI  == effect of antibodies on the chain length and growth of streptococcus sobrinus.
AB  == passive immunization has been suggested as a method to prevent colonization of teeth by mutans streptococci. however, the mechanism of action of antibodies, both polyclonal and monoclonal, is not clear. in this study we investigated the effect of polyclonal antibodies (pabs) and a monoclonal antibody (omvu10) on the  chain length and growth of streptococcus sobrinus. during growth in broth s. sobrinus formed significantly longer chains in the presence of pabs in comparison to pre-immune serum (p < 0.01), but pabs did not influence the growth rate of s.  sobrinus in broth. omvu10 did not influence the growth rate nor the chain length. in order to study the effect of the antibodies on adhesion and growth on a surface, s. sobrinus was grown on hydroxyapatite discs in the presence of two other bacteria, streptococcus oralis and actinomyces viscosus. no effect of the antibodies was found on the total cultivable count of the three bacteria after growth on hydroxyapatite discs. however, the morphology of the s. sobrinus microcolonies was different after growth in the presence of both pabs and omvu10. the colonies were less dense and chains of s. sobrinus could be seen using a confocal laser microscope. after growth in the presence of the control antibodies, the colonies were dense and no long chains could be observed. it was  concluded that pabs influenced the chain length, in broth and on hydroxyapatite discs, and the colony morphology of s. sobrinus on hydroxyapatite discs, whereas  omvu10 influenced the colony morphology of s. sobrinus on hydroxyapatite discs.

AB  == salifluor (5-n-octanoyl-3'-trifluoromethyl-salicylanilide), a broad spectrum antimicrobial agent, was investigated for its ability to inhibit dental plaque formation. a combination of salifluor with pvm/ma copolymer and naf was optimized for its antiplaque effect in mouthrinse and dentifrice formulations based on a series of both laboratory and clinical studies. it was found that salifluor, a highly hydrophobic compound, could not be adequately solubilized with the conventional amount of sodium lauryl sulfate (sls), the most commonly used anionic surfactant in oral hygiene products. however, it was possible to prepare  stable mouthrinse formulations using a mixed surfactant system containing both anionic and nonionic surfactants. the most suitable mixture was found to be a combination of sls, pluronic and tauranol in a proportion of 1:1:1. this combination provided adequate stability and high antimicrobial activity as determined by in vitro microbiological tests. addition of a pvm/ma copolymer to the formulation improved the adsorption and retention of salifluor on stimulated  tooth surfaces in vitro (saliva coated hydroxyapatite disks) by almost two-fold and also increased the antiplaque efficacy in both laboratory and human clinical  studies. it was also found that a non fluoride dentifrice containing a combination of salifluor and pvm/ma copolymer with a dicalcium phosphate dihydrate abrasive, was highly effective in reducing smooth surface and fissure caries in rats. the results of the present studies demonstrated that salifluor is an effective antiplaque agent in mouthrinse and dentifrice when carefully formulated to maximize its delivery and bioavailability on oral surfaces. they also illustrated the difficulties encountered in exploiting the antimicrobial efficacy of highly hydrophobic, nonionic antimicrobial agents such as salifluor in commonly used oral hygiene vehicles.

TI  == monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and interleukin-8 production in mononuclear cells stimulated by oral microorganisms.
AB  == chemokines are a family of low-molecular-weight proinflammatory cytokines that stimulate recruitment of leukocytes. the chemokines interleukin-8 (il-8) and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (mcp-1) are relatively specific chemoattractants for neutrophils and monocytes, respectively. chemokine expression contributes to the presence of different leukocyte populations observed in normal and pathologic states. in the present studies, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) were stimulated by microbes (candida albicans, streptococcus mutans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) selected based upon their importance as oral pathogens. il-8 and mcp-1 gene expression and protein release were determined by northern blot (rna blot) analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. c. albicans, p. gingivalis, and a. actinomycetemcomitans induced high levels of production of both mcp-1 and il-8. s. mutans was a strong inducer of mcp-1, but it did not stimulate significant production of il-8. c. albicans, s. mutans, and a. actinomycetemcomitans were 500 to 5,000 times more potent than p. gingivalis in terms of mcp-1 production. in general, the microbe-to-pbmc ratios required for maximum gene expression of mcp-1 were lower than those for il-8. however, for actual protein release of mcp-1 versus il-8, differences in the effects of various microbe concentrations were observed only for a. actinomycetemcomitans. these results demonstrate that different oral pathogens induce specific dose-dependent patterns of chemokine gene expression and release. such patterns may help explain the immunopathology of oral infections, particularly with regard to inflammatory leukocyte recruitment.

TI  == effects of sublethal exposure to an antiseptic mouthrinse on representative plaque bacteria.
AB  == although the mechanism responsible for the clinical antiplaque efficacy of oral antiseptics is generally considered to be primarily one of bactericidal activity, it has been suggested that oral antiseptics may have additional effects on bacteria exposed to sublethal levels. studies reported herein, investigated the effects of sublethal levels of an essential oil-containing antiseptic mouthrinse  (listerine antiseptic, warner-lambert co., morris plains, nj) on selected activities of representative plaque microorganisms using in vitro models. these studies demonstrated that sublethal exposure to the tested oral antiseptic can have significant effects in reducing intergeneric coaggregation, increasing bacterial generation time, and extracting endotoxin from gram-negative bacteria.  these in vitro activities can be correlated with features of plaque formation and pathogenicity seen in vivo; however, additional studies will be necessary to confirm that these mechanisms are, in fact, operative clinically.

TI  == delmopinol interactions with cell walls of gram-negative and gram-positive oral bacteria.
AB  == the main purpose of the present study was to investigate the influence of delmopinol hydrochloride on the cell surface morphology of gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial cells by using transmission electron microscopy. a second purpose was to evaluate the extraction of cell wall material caused by delmopinol and the binding of radiolabelled delmopinol to the various strains. fresh isolates and type strains of gram-negative rods associated with periodontal disease, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and strains of the gram-positive streptococci streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus salivarius, were exposed to 3.2 mm (0.1%) or 6.4 mm (0.2%) delmopinol hydrochloride from 1 to 90 min. for electron microscopy the cells were fixed and negatively contrast-stained. treatment with 6.4 mm delmopinol for 1 min resulted in marked ultrastructural changes of cell wall components and the outer cell membrane of the 3 gram-negative species compared with control cells, whereas the gram-positive streptococci treated with delmopinol showed little or no morphologic alteration as compared with untreated cells. the result from the electron microscopy was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of proteins released from bacterial cells treated as for electron microscopy. more material was extracted from the gram-negative rods than from the gram-positive cocci. significantly more delmopinol bound to the gram-negative rods than to the streptococci. it appears that the amphiphilic properties of delmopinol make gram-negative rods more vulnerable to delmopinol than gram-positive streptococci.

TI  == adherence of microorganisms to rat salivary pellicles.
AB  == numerous studies, using models to mimic the formation of the acquired pellicle, have concentrated on human saliva-coated hydroxyapatite; in contrast, although the rat is frequently used as an animal model, the information concerning the formation of pellicles from rat saliva is sparse. we compared the ability of streptococcus and actinomyces species to adhere to hydroxyapatite coated by rat saliva (rsha) and human saliva (sha). we also explored the influence of glucan synthesized in situ on the adherence of organisms. we show that each strain of organism has a distinct binding pattern, which was essentially the same with surfaces coated with either rat or human saliva. dissolved rsha beads revealed a  major protein band (35-49 kd), identified as glutamine/glutamic-acid-rich protein; acidic proline-rich protein (31-45 kd and alpha-amylase (66 kd) were also identified. overall, these in vitro data strongly suggest that the principles of bacterial adhesion to rsha are similar to those observed with sha.

TI  == adherence of oral microorganisms to guided tissue membranes: an in vitro study.
AB  == microorganisms can adhere and colonize on an exposed guided tissue regeneration (gtr) membrane thus developing a nidus of infection. the purpose of this study was to compare early bacterial adhesion to three different gtr membranes. expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, polyglactin 910, and collagen were used as the  test membranes. in part i of this study 15 different oral microbes were used to compare their relative ability to adhere to the membranes. six of the most strongly adherent bacteria (actinomyces viscosus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus mutans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and selenomonas sputigena) were selected for part ii of  this study. the membranes were placed in tubes containing broth cultures containing identical concentrations (1 x 10(8) cells/ml) of these bacteria at 37  degrees c. membranes were placed in tubes of media without bacteria as controls.  at 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours, the bacterial cultures were decanted and the membranes in the tubes were agitated gently in reduced transfer fluid (rtf) 4 times to remove non-adherent bacteria. each tube was then sonicated for 30 seconds in 10 ml rtf to detach adherent bacteria. the detached adherent bacteria were counted using a petroff-hausser chamber. data were analyzed by using the sas program. analysis of variance was used to test for differences between multiple means. results showed s. mutans had the strongest attachment to the collagen membrane at 4 and 6 hours. selenomonas sputigena had the lowest adherence capability to all test membranes. polyglactin 910 had significantly (p < 0.05) lower s. mutants adherence than either the eptfe or the collagen membrane at 4 and 6 hours.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == a comparison of two transport media for saliva and subgingival samples.
AB  == this study has shown that microorganisms associated with caries (mutans streptococci, lactobacilli) and marginal periodontitis (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) in pure culture can be stored in vmga or reduced transport fluid and be recovered sufficiently after 24 h. sufficient recovery after 24 h of mail transport was also obtained in 37 saliva samples obtained from adults and 80 subgingival samples from a group of patients before and 3, 6 and 15 months after periodontal treatment. the samples transported in vmga iii showed in comparison to the samples transported in reduced transport fluid a higher recovery rate as well as a higher percentage of  the total viable count for investigated anaerobic species. this was explained by  the different composition of the two media and also by the gel consistency of vmga iii, which maintains a low redox-potential even during transport after transferring a sample into the medium. in a few samples aerobic bacteria increased in both media.

TI  == the binding of delmopinol and chlorhexidine to streptococcus mutans and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans strains with varying degrees of surface hydrophobicity.
AB  == this study evaluated the binding of chlorhexidine and the new surface-active anti-plaque agent delmopinol hydrochloride to streptococcus mutans and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans cells with various cell surface hydrophobicities. the influence of saliva concentration on the binding of these compounds was also investigated. the radiolabeled compounds were incubated with bacteria and the cells were recovered using a centrifugal filtering technique. delmopinol had higher binding to the hydrophilic variant strains than to the hydrophobic parent strains; chlorhexidine had higher binding to hydrophobic than  to hydrophilic a. actinomycetemcomitans strains and higher binding to hydrophilic than to hydrophobic s. mutans strains. the presence of salivary films decreased the binding of both compounds. both delmopinol and chlorhexidine had stronger affinity to a. actinomycetemcomitans cells than to s. mutans cells. at equimolar  concentrations, delmopinol had a lower binding to all strains tested than chlorhexidine. the high reversibility of the delmopinol binding might be related  to a higher diffusion rate and solubility compared with that of chlorhexidine. the amphiphilicity of both molecules is an important feature in their retention to s. mutans and a. actinomycetemcomitans strains of varying hydrophobicities and could play an important role in the substantivity of delmopinol or chlorhexidine  in the oral cavity.

TI  == transmission of oral bacterial species between spouses.
AB  == the transmission of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and mutans streptococci was studied between 4 married couples who suffered from advanced periodontitis. of the 20 couples investigated, the 4 in which both spouses harbored a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were chosen for the transmission study. three of these couples also harbored mutans streptococci. a. actinomycetemcomitans isolates (8-24 per subject) and mutans streptococcal isolates (5-23 per subject) were serotyped by immunodiffusion technique. for ribotyping, chromosomal dna from a. actinomycetemcomitans isolates (4-5 per subject) and mutans streptococcal isolates (4-11 per subject) was digested with restriction endonucleases clai or bgli and hindiii or smai, respectively. p. gingivalis isolates (2-15 per subject) were ribotyped by using clai, bgli and smai. the blotted restriction fragments were hybridized to the plasmid pkk3535, which contains the rrna operon of the e. coli chromosome. the spouses in 2 couples shared the same sero- and ribotypes of a. actinomycetemcomitans and s. mutans. p. gingivalis ribotypes were identical in 2  couples. the result suggests transmission of oral bacteria between spouses.

TI  == bacteriology of dental infections.
AB  == the most common dental diseases, periodontal disease and dental caries, are chronic infections caused by bacteria of normal oral flora. when these bacteria increase in number and irritation exceeds the host defence threshold, disease arises. the human oral flora comprises more than 300 different bacteria. during the last decade approximately 10 species, mainly gram-negative anaerobes, have been noted as putative pathogens in periodontal disease. the gram-positive and facultatively anaerobic mutans streptococci are aetiologically the most important bacteria in dental caries. data have rapidly increased on the association of these bacteria with certain periodontal diseases or caries, on phenotypic and genotypic characteristics, pathogenic mechanisms, antibiotic susceptibility patterns and transmission among family members. chronic dental infections have been the focus of renewed interest because of recent advances in oral microbiology as well as in medicine. we now know that in addition to oral streptococci, recently classified, fastidious periodontal anaerobes can be detected from various extra-oral infections. oral bacteria may spread into the blood stream through ulcerated epithelium in diseased periodontal pockets and cause transient bacteraemias, which are regarded as increased risk, especially for immunocompromised patients or persons with endoprotheses. in these patients,  routine antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for invasive dental care procedures. also the new association between dental infections and myocardial/cerebral infarction have offered new challenges for cooperation between dental and medical researchers.

TI  == the antimicrobial activity of prevention mouthrinse.
AB  == prevention mouthrinse was designed to serve as a vital supplement to normal oral  hygiene procedures. to determine the antimicrobial potency of this mouthrinse, minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics), bactericidal kinetics, and short-term exposure studies were conducted. a spectrum of oral microorganisms was employed in this investigation: streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, serratia  marcescens and candida albicans. microorganisms were cultured in standard enriched media and under appropriate atmospheric conditions. inhibition assays were conducted in tubes, with each mouthrinse dilution assayed in triplicate. mic determinations revealed that all of the microorganisms studied were highly susceptible to prevention mouthrinse, with mics ranging from 16-fold to 128-fold  dilutions. bactericidal kinetics assays showed rapid killing of the test organisms in the presence of the mouthrinse. brief (5-minute) exposure of s. mutans to 8-fold diluted mouthrinse resulted in a substantial delay in growth. under the constraints of this type of study, prevention mouthrinse exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against all of the microorganisms studied. we support the notion that prevention mouthrinse may be a valuable supplement to normal oral hygiene procedures. a 6-month clinical trial assessing the in vivo efficacy of prevention mouthrinse is currently being conducted.

TI  == levels of salivary iga antibodies reactive with bacteria from dental plaque are associated with susceptibility to experimental gingivitis.
AB  == serum igg, iga and igm and salivary iga antibody levels reactive with extracts from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, eubacterium  saburreum and streptococcus mutans, were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay in samples from 12 persons before, during and after experimental gingivitis. the participants refrained from cleaning their teeth until 50% of their gingival units showed bleeding after gentle probing, but not longer than 15 days. samples were taken from serum and saliva, before and during the period of experimental gingivitis, and up to 8 weeks after the start of the experiment. a pattern with minor fluctuations in specific serum and salivary antibody activities was consistently found in all patients. this indicates that immunoregulatory mechanisms succeed in maintaining unchanged antibody levels when plaque load increases. a subgroup of participants with low mean numbers of bleeding gingival units after plaque accumulation, showed significantly higher salivary iga antibody levels reactive with s. mutans, a. actinomycetemcomitans and e. saburreum, as compared with the subgroup reaching high bleeding after probing scores (p < 0.05). when 1 person with outlying values (p < 0.05) for p. gingivalis was excluded from the tests, the former group also showed statistically significant higher salivary antibody levels to this bacterial species. high levels of salivary iga directed against bacteria in dental plaque might thus protect against the development of gingivitis.

TI  == agglutination of streptococcus mutans serotype c cells but inhibition of porphyromonas gingivalis autoaggregation by human lactoferrin.

AB  == mutans streptococci have been strongly implicated in the initiation of dental caries on coronal surfaces. their role in development of root-surface caries is less clear. the etiologic agents of both types of dental caries are likely to elicit systemic immune responses. the objective of the present study, therefore,  was to study the association of clinical variables of disease with humoral igg antibodies to nine oral micro-organisms in 314 adult subjects, aged 45-65 years,  who were at risk for root-surface caries. antibody activity to streptococcus mutans strain ingbritt, s. mutans/s. sobrinus gtfs, s. faecalis strain 19433, actinomyces viscosus strain wvu 626, actinomyces naeslundii strain 12, lactobacillus casei, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans strain y4, porphyromonas gingivalis strain 381, eikenella corrodens strain 1073, and wolinella recta strain 371 was measured by elisa. pearson correlation coefficients among log10 antibody levels within subjects revealed marked positive correlations among subgingival bacteria, generally weak positive correlations among supragingival micro-organisms, and no correlations between elements of the  supragingival battery with the subgingival battery. igg antibody levels to mutans streptococcal antigens were significantly correlated with subject dmf scores (r = 0.23; p less than 0.0001). no significant correlation was seen between dmf scores and antibody to any other supragingival micro-organism tested. further relationships between levels of s. mutans antibody and individual clinical variables were analyzed by step-wise multiple linear regression, resulting in a model that was highly significant (p = 0.0001), with an r2 = 0.14. numbers of missing teeth, coronal caries, root-surface caries, and root-surface restorations were each positively associated with antibody levels to mutans streptococci.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
