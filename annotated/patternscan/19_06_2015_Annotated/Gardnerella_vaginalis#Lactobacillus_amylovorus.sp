TI  == the natural antimicrobial subtilosin a synergizes with lauramide arginine ethyl ester (lae), epsilon-poly-l-lysine (polylysine), clindamycin phosphate and metronidazole, against the vaginal pathogen gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a common, recurrent vaginal infection linked to increased chances of preterm delivery, incidence of sexually transmitted infections and fertility problems. bv is caused by a shift of the vaginal ecosystem from predominately lactobacillus to a multispecies actinomyces biofilm  with the most common representatives identified as gardnerella vaginalis and prevotella spp. current treatments have been associated with increased resistance as well as negative effects on healthy microbiota. the objective of this study was to evaluate the synergistic potential of ten two-antimicrobial combinations against g. vaginalis and four representative lactobacilli. the four tested antimicrobials were lauramide arginine ethyl ester, epsilon-poly-l-lysine, clindamycin phosphate, metronidazole and the bacteriocin subtilosin a. the use of bacteriocins as either synergist or alternative treatment positions bacteriocins  as an excellent alternative to current antibiotics. the microdilution method was  used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of each of the antimicrobials individually, and the checkerboard assay was used to evaluate these mics in combination. clindamycin and subtilosin (cs), and metronidazole and subtilosin were synergistic against g. vaginalis in terms of fractional inhibitory concentration index (fici). all tested combinations were found to have bliss synergy. the combination of clindamycin and polylysine (cp) was identified  as antagonistic against l. acidophilus in terms of both fici and bliss synergy. the combination of clindamycin and metronidazole (cm) was antagonistic against l. vaginalis for both fici and bliss synergy. the combinations of cp, clindamycin and lae, cs, and lae and polylysine were identified as bliss antagonistic against l. vaginalis but did not indicate fici antagonism.

TI  == polyethylene glycol-based hydrogels for controlled release of the antimicrobial subtilosin for prophylaxis of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == current treatment options for bacterial vaginosis (bv) have been shown to be inadequate at preventing recurrence and do not provide protection against associated infections, such as that with hiv. this study examines the feasibility of incorporating the antimicrobial peptide subtilosin within covalently cross-linked polyethylene glycol (peg)-based hydrogels for vaginal administration. the peg-based hydrogels (4% and 6% [wt/vol]) provided a two-phase release of subtilosin, with an initial rapid release rate of 4.0 mug/h (0 to 12 h) followed by a slow, sustained release rate of 0.26 mug/h (12 to 120 h). the subtilosin-containing hydrogels inhibited the growth of the major bv-associated pathogen gardnerella vaginalis with a reduction of 8 log10 cfu/ml with hydrogels  containing >/=15 mug entrapped subtilosin. in addition, the growth of four common species of vaginal lactobacilli was not significantly inhibited in the presence of the subtilosin-containing hydrogels. the above findings demonstrate the potential application of vaginal subtilosin-containing hydrogels for prophylaxis  of bv.

TI  == benzoyl peroxide formulated polycarbophil/carbopol 934p hydrogel with selective antimicrobial activity, potentially beneficial for treatment and prevention of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == the human vagina is colonized by a variety of indigenous microflora; in healthy individuals the predominant bacterial genus is lactobacillus while those with bacterial vaginosis (bv) carry a variety of anaerobic representatives of the phylum actinobacteria. in this study, we evaluated the antimicrobial activity of  benzoyl peroxide (bpo) encapsulated in a hydrogel against gardnerella vaginalis,  one of the causative agents of bv, as well as indicating its safety for healthy human lactobacilli. herein, it is shown that in well diffusion assays g. vaginalis is inhibited at 0.01% hydrogel-encapsulated bpo and that the tested lactobacillus spp. can tolerate concentrations of bpo up to 2.5%. in direct contact assays (cells grown in a liquid culture containing hydrogel with 1% bpo or bpo particles), we demonstrated that hydrogels loaded with 1% bpo caused 6-log reduction of g. vaginalis. conversely, three of the tested lactobacillus spp. were not inhibited while l. acidophilus growth was slightly delayed. the rheological properties of the hydrogel formulation were probed using oscillation  frequency sweep, oscillation shear stress sweep, and shear rate sweep. this shows the gel to be suitable for vaginal application and that the encapsulation of bpo  did not alter rheological properties.

TI  == evidence for gardnerella vaginalis uptake and internalization by squamous vaginal epithelial cells: implications for the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv), a common condition seen in premenopausal women, is associated with preterm labor, pelvic inflammatory disease, and delivery of low birth weight infants. gardnerella vaginalis is the predominant bacterial species  associated with bv, although its exact role in the pathology of bv is unknown. using immunofluorescence, confocal and transmission electron microscopy, we found that vk2 vaginal epithelial cells take up g. vaginalis after exposure to the bacteria. confocal microscopy also indicated the presence of internalized g. vaginalis within vaginal epithelial cells obtained from a subject with bv. using  vk2 cells and (35)s labeled bacteria in an invasion assay, we found that a 1 h uptake of g. vaginalis was 21.8-fold higher than heat-killed g. vaginalis, 84-fold compared to lactobacillus acidophilus and 6.6-fold compared to lactobacillus crispatus. internalization was inhibited by pre-exposure of cells to cytochalasin-d. in addition, the cytoskeletal protein vimentin was upregulated in vk2 cells exposed to g. vaginalis, but there was no change in actin cytoskeletal polymerization/rearrangements or vimentin subcellular relocalization post exposure. cytoskeletal protein modifications could represent a potential mechanism for g. vaginalis mediated internalization by vaginal epithelial cells.  finally, understanding vaginal bacteria/host interactions will allow us to better understand the underlying mechanisms of bv pathogenesis.

TI  == efficacy of vaginal probiotic capsules for recurrent bacterial vaginosis: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.
AB  == objective: we assessed the effectiveness of vaginal probiotic capsules for recurrent bacterial vaginosis (bv) prevention. study design: one hundred twenty healthy chinese women with a history of recurrent bv were assigned randomly to daily vaginal prophylaxis with 1 capsule (probaclac vaginal; nicar laboratories,  inc, blainville, quebec, canada) that contained 8 billion colony-forming units of lactobacillus rhamnosus, l acidophilus, and streptococcus thermophilus (n = 58 women) or 1 placebo capsule (n = 62 women) for 7 days on, 7 days off, and 7 days  on. results: probiotic prophylaxis resulted in lower recurrence rates for bv (15.8% [9/57 women] vs 45.0% [27/60 women]; p < .001) and gardnerella vaginalis incidence through 2 months (3.5% [2/57 women] vs 18.3% [11/60 women]; p = .02). between the 2- and 11-month follow-up period, women who received probiotics reported a lower incidence of bv and g vaginalis. aside from vaginal discharge and malodor, no adverse events were reported in either study group. conclusion: short-term probiotic prophylaxis is well tolerated and reduces bv recurrence and  g vaginalis risk through 11 months after treatment.

TI  == gardnerella vaginalis and lactobacillus sp in liquid-based cervical samples in healthy and disturbed vaginal flora using cultivation-independent methods.
AB  == our objective was to determine the morphotype of the adherent bacteria in liquid-based cytology (lbc) in smears with healthy and disturbed vaginal flora. and to use pcr technology on the same fixed cell sample to establish dna patterns of the 16s rna genes of the bacteria in the sample. thirty samples were randomly  selected from a large group of cervical cell samples suspended in a commercial coagulant fixative "(boonfix)." pcr was used to amplify dna of five bacterial species: lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus jensenii, gardnerella vaginalis, and mycoplasma hominis. the lbc slides were then analyzed by light microscopy to estimate bacterial adhesion. dna of lactobacilli  was detected in all cell samples. seventeen smears showed colonization with gardnerella vaginalis (range 2.6 x 10(2)-3.0 x 10(5) bacteria/mul boonfix sample). two cases were identified as dysbacteriotic with high dna values for gardnerella vaginalis and low values for lactobacillus crispatus. the sample with the highest concentration for gardnerella vaginalis showed an unequivocal gardnerella infection. this study indicates that the adherence pattern of a disturbed flora in liquid-based cervical samples can be identified unequivocally, and that these samples are suitable for quantitative pcr analysis. this cultivation independent method reveals a strong inverse relationship between gardnerella vaginalis and lactobacillus crispatus in dysbacteriosis and unequivocal gardnerella infection.

TI  == probiotics for the treatment of women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == this review considers whether probiotics are effective agents for the treatment and/or prevention of bacterial vaginosis (bv). there seems to be an association between the absence of, or low concentrations of, vaginal lactobacilli and the development of bv. many studies have suggested that the presence of h2o2-producing vaginal lactobacilli may protect against bv, although some studies do not support this hypothesis. in-vitro studies have suggested that certain specific strains of lactobacilli are able to inhibit the adherence of gardnerella vaginalis to the vaginal epithelium and/or produce h2o2, lactic acid and/or bacteriocins, which inhibit the growth of bacteria causing bv. clinical trials showed that intra-vaginal administration of lactobacillus acidophilus for 6-12 days, or oral administration of l. acidophilus or lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus fermentum rc-14 for 2 months, resulted in the cure of bv (defined as a 0-1 positive score according to amsel's criteria), and/or reduced the recurrences of bv, and/or caused an increase in vaginal lactobacilli and restoration of a normal vaginal microbiota, significantly more frequently than did a placebo, acetic acid or no treatment. however, several trials have found no significant difference in the cure rate of bv and in the number of vaginal lactobacilli after intra-vaginal instillation of lactobacilli when compared with  the effect of a placebo or oestrogen. thus, although the available results concerning the effectiveness of the administration of lactobacilli for the treatment of bv are mostly positive, it cannot yet be concluded definitively that probiotics are useful for this purpose.

TI  == lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginal microbiota of healthy women inhibit prevotella bivia and gardnerella vaginalis in coculture and cell culture.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate how human vaginal isolates of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus crispatus inhibit the vaginosis-associated pathogens gardnerella vaginalis and prevotella bivia. results show that all the strains in coculture condition reduced the viability of g. vaginalis and p. bivia, but with differing  degrees of efficacy. the treatment of g. vaginalis- and p. bivia-infected cultured human cervix epithelial hela cells with l. gasseri strain ks120.1 culture or cell-free culture supernatant (cfcs) results in the killing of the pathogens that are adhering to the cells. the mechanism of the killing activity is not attributable to low ph and the presence of lactic acid alone, but rather to the presence of hydrogen peroxide and proteolytic enzyme-resistant compound(s) present in the cfcss. in addition, coculture of g. vaginalis or p. bivia with l.  gasseri ks120.1 culture or ks120.1 bacteria results in inhibition of the adhesion of the pathogens onto hela cells.

TI  == effectiveness of current therapy of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == the study was conducted in order to evaluate effectiveness of the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (bv) with different therapeutic regimes according to recommendations of the world health organization (who). during a one-year period  (february 2000-february 2001) the sexually transmitted diseases (std) center was  visited by 482 women aged 14-51. the diagnosis of bv was established by standard  methods: amsel's clinical criteria and gram stain of vaginal discharge. the first-line treatment was oral metronidazole 2 g single dose. second line was metronidazole 500 mg twice daily orally for 7 days or oral clindamycin 300 mg twice daily for seven days. bv was confirmed in 74 women (15.4%). most often it was observed in women aged 17-30 years of age. thirty-three (44.6% of total) were young women 14-21 years of age. thirty-one (42%) women received a follow-up examination and of those, 11 (38.7%) needed a repeat treatment for bv due to unsatisfactory results of this treatment. it is concluded that treatment of bv with standard methods was not always effective with no significant difference between women under 21 years and older women found in regards to response to treatment. besides antibiotic treatment, the so-called probiotics (lactobacillus  acidophilus) can be taken into consideration as an alternative treatment. additional research about the therapeutic effect of this type of drugs is needed.

TI  == bacteriocin susceptibility of gardnerella vaginalis and its relationship to biotype, genotype, and metronidazole susceptibility.
AB  == objective: our purpose was to investigate the bacteriocin susceptibility of gardnerella vaginalis and its relationship to biotype, genotype, and resistance to metronidazole. study design: bacteriocin susceptibility of 36 g vaginalis clinical isolates was tested against a vaginal strain of lactobacillus acidophilus by a growth-inhibition method. the relationship to biotype, genotype, and resistance to metronidazole were analyzed by the chi2 test and fisher exact test. results: eight g vaginalis strains (22%) were bacteriocin-resistant. biotypes 5 and 7 were found to be the most frequent among these resistant strains. eight (42%) of the 19 isolates classified as biotype 5, 6, or 7 were bacteriocin-resistant compared with none of the isolates that were classified as  other biotypes (p <.01). biotype 5 was found in higher prevalence among the isolates resistant to bacteriocin (62%) than among the susceptible isolates (14%) (p =.01). genotype b was found more frequently among the bacteriocin-resistant strains, but this finding was not statistically significant (p =.71). seven (88%) bacteriocin-resistant strains were also resistant to metronidazole. conclusion: an association between biotype and an increased resistance to bacteriocin was found. the ability of g vaginalis to resist the antibacterial activity of lactobacillus bacteriocin may be a pivotal factor in understanding bacterial vaginosis.

TI  == antimicrobial protein produced by vaginal lactobacillus acidophilus that inhibits gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  == objective: to isolate bacteriocin from a vaginal strain of lactobacillus acidophilus. methods: l. acidophilus 160 was grown on two media. the first was mrs broth for 18 hours; the cells were harvested, washed, and placed into a chemically defined medium. the second medium resembled vaginal fluid minus protein. bacteriocin was precipitated from both media using ammonium sulfate. the growth-inhibiting activity of bacteriocin was determined by a bioassay using nine different isolates of gardnerella vaginalis. results: mrs broth is not a suitable medium for extracting bacteriocin, because it binds with tween 80. bacteriocin was isolated, without contaminating constituents, from chemically defined medium  and identified as a single band by electrophoresis. bacteriocin has a molecular weight of 3.8 kda. all nine isolates of gardnerella were inhibited by the bacteriocin isolated from l. acidophilus 160. conclusions: bacteriocin produced by l. acidophilus 160 was isolated from the chemically defined medium (starvation medium) in a partially pure form. l. acidophilus 160 bacteriocin inhibited growth of all nine isolates of gardnerella vaginalis.

TI  == [the range of antagonistic effects of lactobacillus bacterial strains on etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is caused by uncontrolled sequential overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia, bacteroides spp., peptostreptococcus spp., mobiluncus sp. usually occurring in stable numbers in the bacterial flora of healthy women. on the other hand, different species of bacteria belonging to the genus lactobacillus, most frequently l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus and l. acidophilus, form a group of aerobic bacteria dominating in the  same environment. the diversity and density of their populations depend on the age and health conditions. thanks to their antagonistic and adherence properties  bacteria of the genus lactobacillus can maintain a positive balance role in this  ecosystem. the aim of this study was to assess the antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vagina of healthy women against most common agents of bacterial vaginosis. it was found that nearly all of the tested  lactobacillus strains exerted distinct antagonistic activity against anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia and peptostreptococcus anaerobius and quite a number also against gram-negative rods, while only some of them were able to inhibit gram-positive aerobic cocci as enterococcus faecalis or staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == characterisation and selection of a lactobacillus species to re-colonise the vagina of women with recurrent bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == this paper reports the results of characterising and selecting a strain of lactobacillus for potential use as a probiotic in regenerating the vaginal flora  of women with recurrent episodes of bacterial vaginosis (bv). bv is a condition characterised by a depletion of vaginal lactobacilli accompanied by an overgrowth of a mixed vaginal flora of aerobic, anaerobic and micro-aerophilic species in very large numbers. bv has been associated with various gynaecological and obstetric complications and has an extremely high recurrence rate, due in part to the failure to establish a normal vaginal flora after antimicrobial therapy. a total of 60 vaginal isolates of lactobacilli was assessed for characteristics considered important for vaginal re-colonisation. the characteristics studied were the in-vitro inhibitory activity of the lactobacilli against bacterial species isolated from women with recurrent bv, acid production after growth of the lactobacilli in liquid culture, production of hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) and adhesiveness of the lactobacilli to exfoliated vaginal epithelial cells (vec). four strains of lactobacilli, l. acidophilus (61701 and 61880), l. crispatus (55730) and l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii (65407), demonstrated the greatest  inhibitory activity against the bv-associated bacterial species. two of these isolates (55730 and 61880) produced h2o2. all four isolates produced a highly acidic environment after growth in liquid medium (ph <4). only one of these (strain 61701) was strongly adherent to vec (>100 bacteria/vec). a further isolate (l. acidophilus 48101) did not demonstrate maximum inhibitory activity against bv-associated bacteria, but was found to be a strong producer of h2o2 and was also highly adherent to vec. isolates 61701 and 48101 could be candidates for use as probiotics for vaginal re-colonisation.

TI  == the growth of gardnerella vaginalis and lactobacillus acidophilus in sorbarod biofilms.
AB  == sorbarod biofilms were investigated for their suitability in establishing continuous culture biofilms for the study of bacterial vaginosis. two important organisms in the condition, gardnerella vaginalis and lactobacillus acidophilus,  were studied. in contrast to growth in broth culture, both organisms were maintained for at least 96 h in a steady state on the biofilms. with g. vaginalis, the haemolytic activity was consistently maintained in the biofilms in contrast to short-term activity in broth culture which matched the bacterial titre. the simple sorbarod system appears to be suitable for studying the growth  conditions of bacteria in continuous culture and has potential for investigating  interactions between micro-organisms.

TI  == use of a continuous-culture biofilm system to study the antimicrobial susceptibilities of gardnerella vaginalis and lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  == gardnerella vaginalis and lactobacillus acidophilus have been shown to grow to high titers in a simple biofilm system. this system was used in the present investigation to compare the biofilm-eradicating concentrations (becs) of amoxicillin, clindamycin, erythromycin, and metronidazole to standard tube mic and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) results. with the lactobacillus, the bec/tube mbc ratio was at least 16:1, while for g. vaginalis the ratio varied from 2:1 to 512:1. the simple continuous-culture system used in the present investigation is ideal for investigating the bec for bacteria involved in complex ecological situations such as bacterial vaginosis and may be useful for the identification of the most effective and selective antibiotic therapy.

TI  == composition of the lactobacillus acidophilus complex isolated from vaginal flora.
AB  == one hundred and fifty human vaginal samples containing a diversity of pathogens or nonpathogens (gardnerella vaginalis, streptococcus sp., staphylococcus sp., candida albicans. mycoplasma sp.) were examined for their content in lactobacilli of the lactobacillus acidophilus complex. although all samples contained lactobacilli, strains of the l. acidophilus complex were present in only twenty-nine cases. isolates were further characterized and compared with type strains or reference strains in an attempt to differentiate by phenotypic means the genospecies of the l. acidophilus complex. data regarding specific activities of beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) and of phospho-beta-galactosidase (p-beta-gal) provided no specific information at the species level within the l. acidophilus complex. dna-relatedness differentiates this genospecies. most lactobacilli isolated from the vaginal flora of symptomatic women were genotypically close to  l. gasseri cip 102991t by the technique of dna/dna hybridization.

TI  == effects of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate on the adherence of gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii, and lactobacillus acidophilus to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  == background and objectives: a decreased concentration or total disappearance of lactobacillus acidophilus in the vagina constitutes a frequent observation in bacterial vaginosis. goal of the study: cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate has been evaluated in vitro to detect antiadhesive properties at subinhibitory concentrations for gardnerella vaginalis and mobiluncus curtisii to vaginal epithelial cells (vec). study design: bacterial strains 14c- and or 3h-labeled were tested for adherence and competition to binding sites in vecs before and after treatment at sub-mic with cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate. results: in control tests of adherence, g. vaginalis and m. curtisii had their maximal adhesion at ph 5.4, l. acidophilus at ph 4.4. preincubation of g. vaginalis and m. curtisii with cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate 2.5 mg/ml (subinhibitory concentration) at ph 5.4 reduced adherence to vecs respectively by 48.3% and 34.1%. the same treatment of l. acidophilus showed no statistically significant difference. treatment of vecs alone did not modify adherence. competition tests between l. acidophilus and g. vaginalis and between l. acidophilus and m. curtisii showed that, in small quantities, l. acidophilus could compete with g. vaginalis and m. curtisii for binding sites in vecs at ph 4.4, when pretreated with cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate. at a higher ph (4.8 and 5.4), l. acidophilus in higher quantities did not compete for binding sites occupied by g. vaginalis and m. curtisii. conclusions: cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate at subinhibitory concentrations modifies the adhesiveness of g. vaginalis and m. curtisii to vecs, reducing it by 48.3% and 34.1%, respectively. adhesion of l. acidophilus to vecs is not impaired by pretreatment with cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate at ph 4.4, even if they are in low number and compete for binding sites against pathogens. at higher ph levels, l. acidophilus did not compete for  binding sites occupied by g. vaginalis and m. curtisii.

TI  == the vagina as an ecologic system. current understanding and clinical applications.
AB  == recent advances in understanding the mechanisms of dominance of the healthful microecology by lactobacillus acidophilus through microbicidal enzyme systems has led to renewed interest in ecologic approaches to vaginal health maintenance and  treatment of vaginosis and vaginitis. review of pertinent research suggests that  due to inadequate adherence of lactobacilli from dairy sources, contaminants in commercial sources, and lack of evidence of effectiveness in sparse clinical trials, intravaginal applications of l. acidophilus cannot be recommended. bacterial vaginosis is described in this article as a microecologic shift in the  dominant organism of the microecology from l. acidophilus to gardnerella vaginalis. this results in conditions favorable to vaginal establishment of many  anaerobic organisms. the ability to identify and nurture healthful lactobacilli in the vaginal microflora is suggested as a future direction for health-enhancement-oriented research, practice, and screening.

TI  == bacterial vaginosis is not a simple ecological disorder.
AB  == eighty-four patients with bacterial vaginosis were examined in an open randomized trial, the aim of which was to define clinical results and the microbiological panorama after topical treatment for 1 week with either an acetic acid jelly (a), an estrogen cream (b), a fermented milk product (c) or metronidazole (d). after exclusion because of chlamydia infection (15 cases) or for other reasons, 61 cases remained for complete evaluation 4 weeks after the start of treatment. clinical cure was obtained in 3 cases out of 17 on regimen a, in 1 out of 16 on regimen b, in 1 of 14 on regimen c, and in 13 out of 14 on regimen d. the patients were conclusively either symptomless or symptomatic when examined on 113 occasions. statistically significant reduction after treatment resulting in relief of symptoms was observed in the numbers of corynebacteria and anaerobic cocci, whereas lactobacilli increased in numbers. the instillation of high numbers of lactobacillus acidophilus (c) into the vagina cured only 1 patient and did not influence the predominance of lactobacilli in the vagina at the follow-up examination. the difference in microbiological profile of women in symptomatic and asymptomatic conditions becomes still more apparent when the results of the present and previously published studies on the subject by the present group of investigators are combined. the symptomatic woman is significantly more often harboring corynebacteria, gardnerella vaginalis, peptostreptococci, peptococci, eubacteria and bacteroides species. lactobacilli are significantly reduced in numbers. however, only 51% of our previously symptomatic, but now symptomless women show predominant growth of lactobacilli, which is less than expected for healthy women.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == in vitro adherence of lactobacillus species to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  == because of the reported use of yogurt douches for the treatment of vaginitis, the adherence of lactobacillus species to normal human vaginal epithelial cells was tested by in vitro methods. l. acidophilus and l. bulgaricus isolated from three  commercial yogurts were compared to l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. cellobiosus, and l. casei isolated from clinical specimens and from american type culture collection cultures. l. acidophilus isolated from lactinex tablets was also tested. no significant difference was found among the 19 clinical isolates, the american type culture collection cultures, and the lactinex isolate, but all showed significantly higher (p less than 0.01) adherence than any lactobacillus isolated from yogurt. the presence of gardnerella vaginalis, which adheres strongly to vaginal epithelial cells, was found to interfere with the adherence of lactobacilli from all sources studied.
