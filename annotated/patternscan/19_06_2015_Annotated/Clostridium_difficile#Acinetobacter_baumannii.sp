TI  == pathogen transfer and high variability in pathogen removal by detergent wipes.
AB  == background: the rise in health care-associated infections has placed a greater emphasis on cleaning and disinfection practices. the majority of policies advocate using detergent-based products for routine cleaning, with detergent wipes increasingly being used; however, there is no information about their ability to remove and subsequently transfer pathogens in practice. methods: seven detergent wipes were tested for their ability to remove and transfer staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter baumannii, and clostridium difficile spores  using the 3-stage wipe protocol. results: the ability of the detergent wipes to remove s aureus, a baumannii, and c difficile spores from a stainless steel surface ranged from 1.50 log10 (range, 0.24-3.25), 3.51 log10 (range, 3.01-3.81), and 0.96 log10 (range, 0.26-1.44), respectively, following a 10-second wiping time. all wipes repeatedly transferred significant amounts of bacteria/spores over 3 consecutive surfaces, although the percentage of total microorganisms transferred from the wipes after wiping was low for a number of products. conclusions: detergent-based wipe products have 2 major drawbacks: their variability in removing microbial bioburden from inanimate surfaces and a propensity to transfer pathogens between surfaces. the use of additional complementary measures such as combined detergent/disinfectant-based products and/or antimicrobial surfaces need to be considered for appropriate infection control and prevention.

TI  == kibdelomycin is a bactericidal broad-spectrum aerobic antibacterial agent.
AB  == bacterial resistance to antibiotics continues to grow and pose serious challenges, while the discovery rate for new antibiotics declines. kibdelomycin is a recently discovered natural-product antibiotic that inhibits bacterial growth by inhibiting the bacterial dna replication enzymes dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv. it was reported to be a broad-spectrum aerobic gram-positive agent with selective inhibition of the anaerobic bacterium clostridium difficile. we have extended the profiling of kibdelomycin by using over 196 strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic pathogens recovered from worldwide patient populations. we report the mic50s, mic90s, and bactericidal activities of kibdelomycin. we confirm the gram-positive spectrum and report for the first time that kibdelomycin shows strong activity (mic90, 0.125 mug/ml) against clinical strains of the gram-negative nonfermenter acinetobacter baumannii but only weak activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa. we confirm that well-characterized resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae show no cross-resistance to kibdelomycin and quinolones and coumarin antibiotics. we also show that kibdelomycin is not subject to efflux in pseudomonas, though it is in escherichia coli, and it is generally affected by the outer membrane permeability entry barrier in the nonfermenters p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii, which may be addressable by structure-based chemical modification.

TI  == bloodstream infections among carriers of carbapenem-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae: etiology, incidence and predictors.
AB  == carriers of carbapenem-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae (crkp) are increasingly recognised through active surveillance in much of the world. we studied incidence, aetiology and predictors of bloodstream infections (bsi) among such carriers. via a retrospective cohort study conducted in a tertiary care teaching  hospital, we examined occurrence of bsi within 45 days of crkp carrier detection. three nested case-control studies were conducted to analyse parameters associated with all-cause (all), gram-negative rod (gnr) and crkp bsi. cases and controls were compared with respect to demographics, clinical parameters and recent receipt of antibiotics. a total of 431 patients were identified as crkp carriers  (28% by clinical culture, 72% by rectal surveillance), mean age was 75.2 years. twenty percent of the patients (n = 85) developed bsi, of them 80% (n = 68) with  gnr. of 83 gnr isolates, 58 (70%) were enterobacteriaceae, of which 19 were crkp  and 20 were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers (23% and 24% of total gnr, respectively); 29% of the gnr isolates were nonfermenters (14.5% pseudomonas aeruginosa, 14.5% acinetobacter baumannii). mechanical ventilation predicted all bsi (p = 0.04), whereas clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea  predicted gnr bsi (p = 0.04). receipt of broad-spectrum antibiotics (piperacillin-tazobactam, amikacin, imipenem) was significantly associated with all bsi or gnr bsi. no exposure independently predicted crkp bsi. we conclude that patients detected as crkp carriers are at high risk for bsi within 45 days of detection, primarily with multidrug-resistant gnr. lack of predictive factors  differentiating between pathogens and associated high mortality raises once more  the dilemma regarding the appropriate empiric therapy for crkp carriers who develop severe sepsis.

TI  == evaluation of hydrogen peroxide vapor for the inactivation of nosocomial pathogens on porous and nonporous surfaces.
AB  == background: clostridium difficile spores and multidrug-resistant (mdr) organisms, such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant  enterococcus (vre), and mdr acinetobacter baumannii, are important nosocomial pathogens that are difficult to eliminate from the hospital environment. we evaluated the efficacy of hydrogen peroxide vapor (hpv), a no-touch automated room decontamination system, for the inactivation of a range of pathogens dried onto hard nonporous and porous surfaces in an operating room (or). methods: stainless steel and cotton carriers containing >4 log10 viable mrsa, vre, or mdr  a baumannii were placed at 4 locations in the or along with 7 pouched 6 log10geobacillus stearothermophilus spore biologic indicators (bis). hpv was then used to decontaminate the or. the experiment was repeated 3 times. results: hpv inactivated all spore bis (>6 log10 reduction), and no mrsa, vre, or mdr a baumannii were recovered from the stainless steel and cotton carriers (>4-5 log10 reduction, depending on the starting inoculum). hpv was equally effective at all  carrier locations. we did not identify any difference in efficacy for microbes dried onto stainless steel or cotton surfaces, indicating that hpv may have a role in the decontamination of both porous and nonporous surfaces. conclusion: hpv is an effective way to decontaminate clinical areas where contamination with  bacterial spores and mdr organisms is suspected.

TI  == differential impact of infection control strategies on rates of resistant hospital-acquired pathogens in critically ill surgical patients.
AB  == background: there were two major outbreaks of multi-drug resistant acinetobacter  baumannii (mdra) in our general surgery and trauma intensive care units (icus) in 2004 and 2011. both required aggressive multi-faceted interventions to control. we hypothesized that the infection control response may have had a secondary benefit of reducing rates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa),  vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre), and clostridium difficile (c. diff). methods: we analyzed data retrospectively from a prospective infection control database at a major university hospital and calculated the incidence rates of nosocomial mrsa, vre, and c. diff before and after the two mdra outbreaks (2004 and 2011) in the general surgery and trauma icus, and two unaffected control icus: thoracic surgery icu and medical icu. we tracked incidence rates in 6 mos segments for 24 mos per outbreak and created a composite variable of "any resistant pathogen" for comparison. results: the incidence rates of "any resistant pathogen" were significantly lower in the general surgery icu after both outbreaks (24 to 11 cases per 1000 patient days in 2004, p=0.045 and 7.7 ->4.0 cases per 1000 patient days in 2011, p=0.04). this did not persist after 6  mos. the trauma icu's rate of "any resistant pathogen" did not change after either outbreak (16 ->16.5 cases per 1000 patient days in 2004, p=0.44 and 4.6 ->1.9 cases per 1000 patient days in 2011, p=0.41). the rates in the control icus were unchanged during the study periods. conclusions: rates of resistant pathogens were lower in the general surgery icu after response to mdra outbreaks  in both 2004 and 2011 although the rates increased again with time. there were no changes in rates of resistant pathogens in the trauma icu after mdra outbreaks in 2004 and 2011. outbreak responses may have a differential impact in general surgery icu versus trauma icus.

TI  == safety and clinical outcomes of carbapenem de-escalation as part of an antimicrobial stewardship programme in an esbl-endemic setting.
AB  == objectives: to evaluate the safety and clinical outcomes of patients who received carbapenem de-escalation as guided by an antimicrobial stewardship programme (asp) in a setting where esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae are endemic. methods:  patients receiving meropenem or imipenem underwent a prospective asp review for eligibility for de-escalation according to defined institutional guidelines. patients in whom carbapenem was de-escalated or not de-escalated, representing the acceptance and rejection of the asp recommendation, respectively, were compared. the primary outcome was the clinical success rate; secondary outcomes included the 30 day readmission and mortality rates, the duration of carbapenem therapy, the incidence of adverse drug reactions due to antimicrobials, the acquisition of carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria and the occurrence of  clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea (cdad). results: the de-escalation recommendations for 300 patients were evaluated; 204 (68.0%) were accepted. the patient demographics and disease severity were similar. the clinical success rates were similar [de-escalated versus not de-escalated, 183/204 (89.7%) versus  85/96 (88.5%), p=0.84], as was the survival at hospital discharge [173/204 (84.8%) versus 79/96 (82.3%), p=0.58]. in the de-escalated group, the duration of carbapenem therapy was shorter (6 versus 8 days, p<0.001), the rate of adverse drug reactions was lower [11/204 (5.4%) versus 12/96 (12.5%), p=0.037], there was less diarrhoea [9/204 (4.4%) versus 12/96 (12.5%), p=0.015], there was a lower incidence of carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii acquisition [4/204 (2.0%) versus 7/96 (7.3%), p=0.042] and there was a lower incidence of cdad [2/204 (1.0%) versus 4/96 (4.2%), p=0.081]. conclusions: this study suggests that the asp-guided de-escalation of carbapenems led to comparable clinical success, fewer adverse effects and a lower incidence of the development of resistance. this approach is safe and practicable, and should be a key component of an asp.

TI  == inhaled colistin for treatment of pneumonia due to colistin-only-susceptible acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == purpose: colistin is used for the treatment of pneumonia associated with multidrug- resistant acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa. however, the best route of administration and dosage is not known. we report our experience with aerosolized colistin in twelve patients with pneumonia caused by  colistin-only-susceptible (cos) a. baumannii. materials and methods: we retrospectively reviewed patients' medical records who were treated with aerosolized colistin for the treatment of pneumonia. results: ten patients were treated only with aerosolized colistin inhalation and two patients received a 3-day course intravenous colistin, and then switched to colistin inhalation therapy. the median duration of aerosolized colistin therapy was 17 days (5-31 days). four patients were treated only with aerosolized colistin, whereas 4 patients received concomitant glycopeptides, and 4 received concomitant levofloxacin or cefoperazone/sulbactam. at the end of the therapy, the clinical response rate and bacteriological clearance rate was 83% and 50%, respectively. colistin-resistant strains were isolated from 3 patients after aerosolized colistin therapy; however, all of them showed favorable clinical response. the median interval between inhalation therapy and resistance was 7 days (range 5-19  days). acute kidney injury developed in 3 patients. two patients experienced clostridium difficile associated diarrhea. one patient developed fever and skin rash after aerosolized colistin therapy. no patient developed neurotoxicity or bronchospasm. conclusion: colistin inhalation therapy is deemed tolerable and safe, and could be beneficial as an adjuctive therapy for the management of pneumonia due to cos a. baumannii. however, the potential development of colistin resistance cannot be overlooked.

TI  == impact of electronic surveillance on isolation practices.
AB  == objective: to assess the impact of an electronic surveillance system on isolation practices and rates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). design: a pre-post test intervention. setting: inpatient units (except psychiatry and labor and delivery) in 4 new york city hospitals. patients: all patients for  whom isolation precautions were indicated, may 2009-december 2011. methods: trained observers assessed isolation sign postings, availability of isolation carts, and staff use of personal protective equipment (ppe). infection rates were obtained from the infection control department. regression analyses were used to  examine the association between the surveillance system, infection prevention practices, and mrsa infection rates. results: a total of 54,159 isolation days and 7,628 staff opportunities for donning ppe were observed over a 31-month period. odds of having an appropriate sign posted were significantly higher after intervention than before intervention (odds ratio [or], 1.10 [95% confidence interval {ci}, 1.01-1.20]). relative to baseline, postintervention sign posting improved significantly for airborne and droplet precautions but not for contact precautions. sign posting improved for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (or, 1.51 [95% ci, 1.23-1.86]; [formula: see text]), clostridium difficile (or, 1.59 [95% ci, 1.27-2.02]; [formula: see text]), and acinetobacter baumannii (or, 1.41 [95%  ci, 1.21-1.64]; [formula: see text]) precautions but not for mrsa precautions (or, 1.11 [95% ci, 0.89-1.39]; [formula: see text]). staff and visitor adherence  to ppe remained low throughout the study but improved from 29.1% to 37.0% after the intervention (or, 1.14 [95% ci, 1.01-1.29]). mrsa infection rates were not significantly different after the intervention. conclusions: an electronic surveillance system resulted in small but statistically significant improvements  in isolation practices but no reductions in infection rates over the short term.  such innovations likely require considerable uptake time.

TI  == comparative analysis of fecal microflora of healthy full-term indian infants born with different methods of delivery (vaginal vs cesarean): acinetobacter sp. prevalence in vaginally born infants.
AB  == in this study fecal microflora of human infants born through vaginal delivery (vb) and through cesarean section (cb) were investigated using culture-independent 16s rdna cloning and sequencing approach. the results obtained clearly revealed that fecal microbiota of vb infants distinctly differ from those in their counterpart cb infants. the intestinal microbiota of infants  delivered by cesarean section appears to be more diverse, in terms of bacteria species, than the microbiota of vaginally delivered infants. the most abundant bacterial species present in vb infants were acinetobacter sp., bifidobacterium sp. and staphylococcus sp. however, cb infant's fecal microbiota was dominated with citrobacter sp., escherichia coli and clostridium difficile. the intestinal  microbiota of cesarean section delivered infants in this study was also characterized by an absence of bifidobacteria species. an interesting finding of  our study was recovery of large number of acinetobacter sp. consisting of acinetobacter pittii (former acinetobacter genomic species 3), acinetobacter junii and acinetobacter baumannii in the vb infants clone library. among these, acinetobacter baumannii is a known nosocomial pathogen and acinetobacter pittii (genomic species 3) is recently recognized as clinically important taxa within the acinetobacter calcoaceticus-acinetobacter baumannii (acb) complex. although none of the infants had shown any sign of clinical symptoms of disease, this observation warrants a closer look.

TI  == biocidal activity of metalloacid-coated surfaces against multidrug-resistant microorganisms.
AB  == background: the antimicrobial effects of a coating of molybdenum trioxide (moo3)  has been recently described. the metalloacid material produces oxonium ions (h3o+), which creates an acidic ph that is an effective, non specific antimicrobial. we determined the in vitro antimicrobial activity of molybdenum trioxide metalloacid-coated surfaces. methods: metalloacid-coated and non-coated  (control) surfaces were contaminated by exposing them for 15 minutes to microbial suspensions containing 105 cfu/ml. eleven microorganisms responsible for nosocomial infections were tested: two staphylococcus aureus strains (the hetero-vancomycin intermediate mrsa mu50 strain and a st80-pvl-producing mrsa strain); a vancomycin-resistant vana enterococcus faecium strain; three extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae strains; a mbl-producing pseudomonas aeruginosa strain; a multidrug-resistant acinetobacter  baumannii strain; a toxin-producing clostridium difficile strain; and two fungi (candida albicans and aspergillus fumigatus). the assay tested the ability of the coated surfaces to kill microorganisms. results: against all non-sporulating microorganisms tested, metalloacid-coated surfaces exhibited significant antimicrobial activity relative to that of the control surfaces within two to six hours after contact with the microorganisms (p < 0.001). microorganism survival on the coated surfaces was greatly impaired, whereas microorganism survival on control surfaces remained substantial. conclusions: we suggest that, facing the continuing shedding of microorganisms in the vicinity of colonized or infected patients, the continuous biocidal effect of hydroxonium oxides against multidrug-resistant microorganisms may help limit environmental contamination between consecutive cleaning procedures.

TI  == national institute of allergy and infectious disease (niaid) funding for studies  of hospital-associated bacterial pathogens: are funds proportionate to burden of  disease?
AB  == background: hospital-associated infections (hais) are associated with a considerable burden of disease and direct costs greater than $17 billion. the pathogens that cause the majority of serious hais are enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, clostridium difficile, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species, referred as esckape. we aimed to determine the amount of funding the national institute of health (nih) national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid) allocates to research on antimicrobial resistant pathogens, particularly  esckape pathogens. methods: the nih research portfolio online reporting tools (report) database was used to identify niaid antimicrobial resistance research grants funded in 2007-2009 using the terms "antibiotic resistance," "antimicrobial resistance," and "hospital-associated infection." results: funding for antimicrobial resistance grants has increased from 2007-2009. antimicrobial resistance funding for bacterial pathogens has seen a smaller increase than non-bacterial pathogens. the total funding for all eskcape pathogens was $ 22,005,943 in 2007, $ 30,810,153 in 2008 and $ 49,801,227 in 2009. s. aureus grants received $ 29,193,264 in fy2009, the highest funding amount of all the esckape pathogens. based on 2009 funding data, approximately $1,565 of research money was spent per s. aureus related death and $750 of was spent per c. difficile related death. conclusions: although the funding for esckape pathogens  has increased from 2007 to 2009, funding levels for antimicrobial resistant bacteria-related grants is still lower than funding for antimicrobial resistant non-bacterial pathogens. efforts may be needed to improve research funding for resistant-bacterial pathogens, particularly as their clinical burden increases.

TI  == the rise of carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == acinetobacter spp. are gram-negative bacteria that have become one of the most difficult pathogens to treat. the species a. baumannii, largely unknown 30 years  ago, has risen to prominence particularly because of its ability to cause infections in immunocompromised patients. it is now a predominant pathogen in many hospitals as it has acquired resistance genes to virtually all antibiotics capable of treating gram-negative bacteria, including the fluoroquinolones and the cephalosporins. some members of the species have accumulated these resistance genes in large resistance islands, located in a "hot-spot" within the bacterial chromosome. the only conventional remaining treatment options were the carbapenems. however, a. baumannii possesses an inherent class d beta-lactamase gene (blaoxa-51-like) that can have the ability to confer carbapenem resistance.  additionally, mechanisms of carbapenem resistance have emerged that derive from the importation of the distantly related class d beta-lactamase genes blaoxa-23 and blaoxa-58. although not inducible, the expression of these genes is controlled by mobile promoters carried on isaba elements. it has also been found  that other resistance genes including the chromosomal class c beta-lactamase genes conferring cephalosporin resistance are controlled in the same manner. colistin is now considered to be the final drug capable of treating infections caused by carbapenem-resistant a. baumannii; however, strains are now being isolated that are resistant to this antibiotic as well. the increasing inability  to treat infections caused by a. baumannii ensures that this pathogen more than ranks with mrsa or clostridium difficile as a threat to modern medicine.

TI  == multidrug-resistant organisms, wounds and topical antimicrobial protection.
AB  == multidrug-resistant organisms (mdros) are increasingly implicated in both acute and chronic wound infections. the limited therapeutic options are further compromised by the fact that wound bacteria often co-exist within a biofilm community which enhances bacterial tolerance to antibiotics. as a consequence, topical antiseptics may be an important consideration for minimising the opportunity for wound infections involving mdros. the objective of this research  was to investigate the antimicrobial activity of a silver-containing gelling fibre dressing against a variety of mdros in free-living and biofilm states, using stringent in vitro models designed to simulate a variety of wound conditions. mdros included acinetobacter baumannii, community-associated methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. clostridium difficile was also included in the study because it carries many of the characteristics seen in mdros and evidence of multidrug resistance is emerging. sustained in vitro antimicrobial activity of the silver-containing dressing was shown against 10 mdros in a simulated wound fluid over 7 days, and inhibitory and bactericidal effects against both free-living and biofilm phenotypes were also consistently shown in simulated colonised wound surface models. the in vitro data support consideration of the silver-containing gelling fibre dressing as part of a protocol of care in the management of wounds colonised or infected with mdros.

TI  == efficacy, efficiency and safety aspects of hydrogen peroxide vapour and aerosolized hydrogen peroxide room disinfection systems.
AB  == background: this was a head-to-head comparison of two hydrogen-peroxide-based room decontamination systems. aim: to compare the efficacy, efficiency and safety of hydrogen peroxide vapour (hpv; clarus r, bioquell, andover, u.k.) and aerosolized hydrogen peroxide (ahp; sr2, sterinis, now supplied as glosair, advanced sterilization products (asp), johnson & johnson medical ltd, wokingham,  u.k.) room disinfection systems. method: efficacy was tested using 4- and 6-log geobacillus stearothermophilus biological indicators (bis) and in-house prepared  test discs containing approximately 10(6) meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), clostridium difficile and acinetobacter baumannii. safety was assessed by detecting leakage of hydrogen peroxide using a hand-held detector. efficiency was assessed by measuring the level of hydrogen peroxide using a hand-held sensor at three locations inside the room, 2 h after the start of the cycles. findings: hpv generally achieved a 6-log reduction, whereas ahp generally achieved less than a 4-log reduction on the bis and in-house prepared test discs. uneven distribution was evident for the ahp system but not the hpv system. hydrogen peroxide leakage during ahp cycles with the door unsealed, as per the manufacturer's operating manual, exceeded the short-term exposure limit (2 ppm) for more than 2 h. when the door was sealed with tape, as per the hpv system, hydrogen peroxide leakage was <1 ppm for both systems. the mean concentration of  hydrogen peroxide in the room 2 h after the cycle started was 1.3 [standard deviation (sd) 0.4] ppm and 2.8 (sd 0.8) ppm for the four hpv and ahp cycles, respectively. none of the readings were <2 ppm for the ahp cycles. conclusion: the hpv system was safer, faster and more effective for biological inactivation.

TI  == the role played by contaminated surfaces in the transmission of nosocomial pathogens.
AB  == studies in the 1970s and 1980s suggested that environmental surface contamination played a negligible role in the endemic transmission of healthcare-associated infections. however, recent studies have demonstrated that several major nosocomial pathogens are shed by patients and contaminate hospital surfaces at concentrations sufficient for transmission, survive for extended periods, persist despite attempts to disinfect or remove them, and can be transferred to the hands of healthcare workers. evidence is accumulating that contaminated surfaces make an important contribution to the epidemic and endemic transmission of clostridium difficile, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and norovirus and that improved environmental decontamination contributes to the control of outbreaks. efforts to improve environmental hygiene should include enhancing the efficacy of cleaning and disinfection and reducing the shedding of pathogens. further high-quality studies are needed to clarify the role played by surfaces in nosocomial transmission and to determine the effectiveness of different interventions in reducing associated infection rates.

AB  == the main objective of this study is to identify, in the literature, articles about the occurrence of contamination from inanimate surfaces and a possible dissemination of resistant bacteria in the hospital environment. a bibliographic  survey was performed with articles published in the databases lilacs, medline, science direct, scopus and isi web of knowledge, between 2000 and 2008. twenty-one articles were selected and analyzed. the analyzed studies highlighted  the presence of bacteria on monitors, bed grids, tables, faucets, telephones, keyboards and other objects. there was a prevalence of staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin, clostridium difficile, acinetobacter baumannii and enterococcus resistant to vancomycin, being the predictive factor the previous occupation of patients colonized by these microorganisms. there was a similarity  observed among the isolated strains of colonized and/or infected patients and the strains of the environment by molecular typification. these evidences reinforce the need for knowledge and control of the sources of pathogens in the hospital environment.

TI  == the impact of enhanced cleaning within the intensive care unit on contamination of the near-patient environment with hospital pathogens: a randomized crossover study in critical care units in two hospitals.
AB  == objectives: to determine the effect of enhanced cleaning of the near-patient environment on the isolation of hospital pathogens from the bed area and staff hands. design: prospective randomized crossover study over the course of 1 yr. setting: intensive care units at two teaching hospitals. patients: there were 1252 patients staying during enhanced cleaning and 1331 staying during standard cleaning. interventions: in each of six 2-month periods, one unit was randomly selected for additional twice-daily enhanced cleaning of hand contact surfaces. measurements and main results: agar contact samples were taken at five sites around randomly selected bed areas, from staff hands, and from communal sites three times daily for 12 bed days per week. patients admitted in the year commencing april 2007 were analyzed for hospital-acquired colonization and infection. over the course of 1152 bed days, 20,736 samples were collected. detection of environmental methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus per bed-area day was reduced during enhanced cleaning phases from 82 of 561 (14.6%) to 51 of 559 (9.1%) (adjusted odds ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.40-0.86; p = .006). other targeted pathogens (acinetobacter baumannii, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and clostridium difficile) were rarely detected. subgroup analyses showed reduced methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus contamination on doctors' hands during enhanced cleaning (3 of 425; 0.7% vs. 11 of 423; 2.6%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.26; 95% confidence interval, 0.07-0.95; p = .025) and a trend to reduction on nurses' hands (16 of 1647; 1.0%  vs. 28 of 1694; 1.7%; adjusted odds ratio 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.29-1.08; p = .077). all 1252 critical care patients staying during enhanced and 1,331 during standard cleaning were included, but no significant effect on patient methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus acquisition was observed (adjusted odds ratio, 0.98; 95% confidence interval, 0.58-1.65; p = .93). conclusions: enhanced cleaning reduced environmental contamination and hand carriage, but no significant effect was observed on patient acquisition of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. trial registry: isrctn. identifier:  06298448. http://www.controlled-trials.com/isrctn/.

AB  == objective: to determine the effectiveness of a uv-c-emitting device to eliminate  clinically important nosocomial pathogens in a contaminated hospital room. methods: this study was carried out in a standard but empty hospital room (phase  1) and in a room previously occupied by a patient with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) or vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) infection (phase 2) in an acute care tertiary hospital in north carolina from january 21 through september 21, 2009. during phase 1, 8 x 8 cm formica sheets contaminated  with approximately 10(4)-10(5) organisms of mrsa, vre, multidrug-resistant (mdr)  acinetobacter baumannii, or clostridium difficile spores were placed in a hospital room, both in direct line of sight of the uv-c device and behind objects. after timed exposure, the presence of the microbes was assessed. during  phase 2, specific sites in rooms that had housed patients with mrsa or vre infection were sampled before and after uv-c irradiation. after timed exposure, the presence of mrsa and vre and total colony counts were assessed. results: in our test room, the effectiveness of uv-c radiation in reducing the counts of vegetative bacteria on surfaces was more than 99.9% within 15 minutes, and the reduction in c. difficile spores was 99.8% within 50 minutes. in rooms occupied by patients with mrsa, uv-c irradiation of approximately 15 minutes duration resulted in a decrease in total cfus per plate (mean, 384 cfus vs 19 cfus; p < .001), in the number of samples positive for mrsa (81 [20.3%] of 400 plates vs 2  [0.5%] of 400 plates; p < .001), and in mrsa counts per mrsa-positive plate (mean, 37 cfus vs 2 cfus; p < .001). conclusions: this uv-c device was effective  in eliminating vegetative bacteria on contaminated surfaces both in the line of sight and behind objects within approximately 15 minutes and in eliminating c. difficile spores within 50 minutes.

TI  == failure of tigecycline to treat severe clostridium difficile infection.
AB  == clostridium difficile infection is an emerging and often difficult-to-treat iatrogenic complication. recent data suggest that tigecycline, a novel antibiotic with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, can be used successfully to treat patients with severe clostridium difficile infection. we report a 70-year-old man who developed severe clostridium difficile infection, was admitted to the intensive care unit and eventually succumbed to complications of his illness despite receiving tigecycline for approximately three weeks in combination with vancomycin, metronidazole and intravenous immunoglobulin. additionally, we discuss the unique challenges that emerged during tigecycline treatment, such as  the development of proteus mirabilis bacteraemia and of colonisation with acinetobacter baumannii resistant to tigecycline. finally, we review data on other cases reported in the medical literature. even though tigecycline looks promising for the treatment of clostridium difficile infection, we urge caution against its indiscriminate use for off label indications.

TI  == [recent trend and research issues related to antimicrobial-resistant bacteria].
AB  == the discovery of penicillin in 1928 was followed by the discovery and synthesis of various kinds of antimicrobial agents such as quinolone, aminogycoside, macrolide, tetracyclone, and oxazolidinone. these discoveries dramatically decreased the mortality rate due to infectious diseases. however, bacteria have also acquired antimicrobial-resistance genes or changed their own genes to oppose these antimicrobial agents, and now drug-resistant bacteria are becoming a serious clinical concern. today, contagious diseases must be treated with the limited number of effective antimicrobial agents available. infection control measures are required to prevent the spread of resistant bacteria in the clinical environment, and we must also increase our understanding of the drug-resistant mechanisms of bacteria. in this issue we wish to introduce the recent worldwide trend in antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, especially multidrug-resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, and multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa, along with recently-discovered antimicrobial-resistant systems.

TI  == ozone gas is an effective and practical antibacterial agent.
AB  == background: bacterial infections continue to pose a threat to health in many institutional and communal settings, and epidemics are frequent. current control  measures are clearly inadequate; thus, there is a need for a simple, effective, and safe way to decontaminate surfaces. methods: we evaluated the efficacy of a portable ozone-generating machine, equipped with a catalytic converter and an accessory humidifier, to inactivate 15 different species of medically important bacteria. results: an ozone dosage of 25 ppm for 20 minutes, with a short burst of humidity in excess of 90% relative humidity, was able to inactivate more than  3 log(10) colony-forming units of most of the bacteria, including acinetobacter baumannii, clostridium difficile, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, in both in a laboratory test system and simulated field conditions. in many cases, complete eradication was achieved. dried and wet samples were equally vulnerable to the ozone. inactivation of bacterial samples dried onto soft surfaces (eg, fabric, cotton, filter paper) were comparable with that observed for samples on plastic. conclusions: the ozone generator can provide a valuable decontamination tool for the removal of bacteria in many institutional and communal settings, including hospitals and other health care institutions.

TI  == the maxwell finland lecture: for the duration-rational antibiotic administration  in an era of antimicrobial resistance and clostridium difficile.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance is frequently associated with clinical use of antibiotics. this close association suggests that efforts to manage our use of these potent agents can have an impact on the prevalence of resistance. unfortunately, one size does not fit all when considering the response of bacterial pathogens to antimicrobial exposure. measures that may prevent resistance in some species (such as using multiple antibiotics to treat tuberculosis) may exacerbate the problem of resistance in others (such as pseudomonas aeruginosa or acinetobacter baumannii). the simplest approach is to use fewer antibiotics and thereby apply less selective pressure to the prevalent  flora. among available strategies to reduce use, reductions in length of antimicrobial regimens are the safest and are likely to be the most palatable to  practicing clinicians. studies are urgently needed to define minimal lengths of therapy to ensure that efforts at reduced use are safe and effective.

TI  == three novel highly charged copper-based biocides: safety and efficacy against healthcare-associated organisms.
AB  == objectives: we investigated three novel highly charged copper-based inorganic biocidal formulations for their activity against organisms highly relevant to healthcare-associated infection. methods: the three copper-based formulations were tested: (i) against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), legionella pneumophila, acinetobacter calcoaceticus/baumannii (accb), glycopeptide-resistant enterococcus and spores of clostridium difficile in time-kill assays; (ii) for their ability to decontaminate ultramicrofibre (umf) cloths; and (iii) for their cytotoxicity to human skin and intestinal epithelial cells. results: all three copper-based formulations were potently biocidal down to concentrations of 1 ppm for both stationary- and log-phase organisms, and they were all active against c. difficile spores. at 150 ppm, they achieved a complete (>6 log10) kill of mrsa and accb mostly within 1 h. this biocidal activity was not achieved by copper sulphate or the inorganic binders used in the formulations. all three copper-based formulations completely decontaminated umf cloths containing mrsa, accb or c. difficile spores, suggesting that any of these copper-based formulations would be highly beneficial in the healthcare environment. all three  copper-based formulations and copper sulphate were not cytotoxic to human epithelial cells up to concentrations of 100-200 ppm. conclusions: all three of the novel copper-based biocidal formulations, but not their components (copper sulphate and inorganic binders), have potent activity against organisms highly relevant to healthcare-associated infections.

TI  == prediction of specific pathogens in patients with sepsis: evaluation of treat, a  computerized decision support system.
AB  == background: prediction of bacterial infections and their pathogens allows for early, directed investigation and treatment. we assessed the ability of treat, a  computerized decision support system, to predict specific pathogens. methods: treat uses data available within the first few hours of infection presentation in a causal probabilistic network to predict sites of infection and specific pathogens. we included 3529 patients (920 with microbiologically documented infections) participating in the observational and interventional trials of the treat system in israel, germany and italy. discriminatory performance of treat to predict individual pathogens was expressed by the auc with 95% confidence intervals. calibration was assessed using the hosmer-lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistic. results: the aucs for gram-negative bacteria, including pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella spp. and escherichia coli, ranged between 0.70 and 0.80 (all significant). adequate calibration was demonstrated for any gram-negative infection and individual bacteria, except for e. coli. discrimination and calibration were acceptable for enterococcus spp. (auc 0.71, 0.65-0.78), but not for staphylococcus aureus (auc 0.63, 0.55-0.71). the few infections caused by candida spp. and clostridium difficile were well predicted (aucs 0.74, 0.54-0.95; and 0.94, 0.88-1.00, respectively). the coverage with treat's recommendation exceeded that observed with physicians' treatment for all  pathogens, except candida spp. conclusions: treat predicted individual pathogens  causing infection well. prediction of s. aureus was inferior to that observed with other pathogens. treat can be used to triage patients by the risk for specific pathogens. the system's predictions enable it to prescribe appropriate antibiotic treatment prior to pathogen identification.

TI  == a comparison of available and investigational antibiotics for complicated skin infections and treatment-resistant staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus.
AB  == this article compares vancomycin, teicoplanin, quinupristin-dalfopristin, linezolid, daptomycin, tigecyline, dalbavancin, telavancin, ceftobiprole, oritavancin, and ramoplanin for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssi), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), enterococcus, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus. vancomycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, is administered intravenously, and is the mainstay of treatment for mrsa and csssi. while not available in the u.s., teicoplanin, another glycopeptide antibiotic, can be administered intramuscularly and has simpler dosing and monitoring requirements than vancomycin. quinupristin/dalfopristin treats vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref) infections but inhibits cytochrome p450 a3p4, and has only modest activity against mrsa pneumonia. daptomycin effectively treats csssi but not pneumonia caused by mrsa, and is effective against all strains of staphylococcus. linezolid, available orally and  intravenously, is approved to treat community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonia,  csssi, and infections caused by mrsa and vancomycin-resistant enterococci including infections with concurrent bacteraemia and vree tigecycline, a glycylcycline derived from minocycline, has been approved by the fda to treat csssi and complicated intraabdominal infections, and might be effective against acinetobacter baumannii; its primary side effect is digestive upset. dalbavancin, effective against mrsa and administered intravenously once weekly, possesses coverage similar to vancomycin. telavancin deploys multiple mechanisms of action  and is effective against mrsa and gram-positive bacteria resistant to vancomycin. ceftobiprole, a cephalosporin effective against mrsa, has few side effects. oritavancin demonstrates similar activity to vancomycin but possesses extended activity against vancomycin-resistant staphylococcus and enterococci. ramoplanin, a macrocyclic depsipeptide, is unstable in the bloodstream but can be taken orally to treat clostridium difficile colitis.
