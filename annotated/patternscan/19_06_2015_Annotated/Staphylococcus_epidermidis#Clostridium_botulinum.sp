TI  == [microbiological contamination and antimicrobial activity of cristalised cane sugar on some medically important microorganisms in costa rica].
AB  == microbiological contamination and antimicrobial activity of cristalised cane sugar on some medically important microorganisms in costa rica. unrefined cristalised cane sugar, obtained after the filtration and evaporation of sugar cane juice, is a nutritional product of traditional consumption in costa rica and other neotropical countries. it has been used in the topic treatment of infected  wounds, with satisfactory results even with some antibiotic-ressistant bacteria.  we studied the microbiological quality of 50 commercial samples. the analyses included total aerobic and anaerobic bacteria plate count; aerobic and anaerobic  spore count; mold and yeast count; total and fecal coliforms; and presence of clostridium botulinum. the antimicrobial effect was tested for staphylococcus aureus (atcc 25923), s. epidermidis (ucr 2902), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 9027), escherichia coli (atcc 25922), salmonella enteritidis (atcc 13076), listeria monocytogenes (atcc 19116) and aspergillus niger (asni 06). most of the  samples (76%) presented counts lower than 100 cfu/g especially for sporulated forms (90% lower than 20 cfu/g), the mold and yeast count was higher (38% higher  than 10(2) cfu/g), demonstrating the importance of these microorganisms in the spoilage of the product; 76% of the samples presented fecal contamination; c. botulinum was not isolated with the methodology employed. no inhibitory effect was observed for a. niger, but all samples han an inhibitory effect over the other species, especially for p. aeruginosa and s. aureus.

TI  == [evaluation of the antimicrobial action of honey against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, salmonella  enteritidis, listeria monocytogenes and aspergillus niger. evaluation of its microbiological charge].
AB  == the evaluation of the microbiological charge present in costa rican samples as the evaluation of its antimicrobial activity over different microorganisms, including those associated to wound infections, will allow to emit criteria referred to its use in therapeutic treatments, specially as alternative therapy for cases involving antibiotic resistant bacteria. the microbiological charge of  25 honey samples, acquired in costa rican markets was evaluated through several indicators including total plate aerobic count, total plate anaerobic count, total aerobic spore count, total anaerobic spore count and molds and yeast count. also, samples were inoculated in tubes with chopped meat media and plated in egg  yolk agar in order to determine the presence of clostridium botulinum. for the antimicrobial activity evaluation, the diffusion method in muller hinton agar was performed, testing different honey concentrations (100, 75, 50, 25, 12,5 and 6,25 % v/v) against staphylococcus aureus (atcc 25923), staphylococcus epidermidis (ucr 2902), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 9027), escherichia coli (atcc25922), salmonella enteritidis (atcc 13076), listeria monocytogenes (atcc 19116) and aspergillus niger. the results obtained for the microbiological characterization  of honey show that 91% of samples had counts equal or lower than 1,0 x 10(1) cfu/g. no positive result was obtained for the isolation of c. botulinum. 24 of the samples analyzed inhibited the growth of s. aureus even in a 25% v/v concentration, nevertheless, a. niger was no inhibited by any of the samples tested.

TI  == an investigation into the microflora of heroin.
AB  == in 2000, an unusual increase of morbidity and mortality among illegal injecting drug users in the uk and ireland was reported and clostridium novyi was identified as the likely source of the serious infection, although infections due to c. botulinum and bacillus cereus were also reported. because heroin was a possibile source of infection, this study investigated the microflora of heroin samples seized in england during 2000 and 2002. two methods were developed for the examination of the microflora of heroin. the first consisted of suspension of the drug in maximum recovery diluent (mrd) which was inoculated directly into clostridium botulinum isolation cooked meat broth (cbi). the second method rendered the heroin soluble in citric acid, concentrated particulate material (and bacterial cells) by filtration and removed heroin residues by washing with citric acid and phosphate-buffered saline before placing the filter in cbi broth. duplicate cbi broths from both methods were incubated without heating and after heating at 60 degrees c for 30 min. subcultures were made after incubation for 7  and 14 days on to eight different solid media. the methods were evaluated with heroin samples spiked with either c. botulinum or c. novyi spore suspensions; recovery of 10 spores in the original sample was demonstrated. fifty-eight heroin samples were tested by citric acid solubilisation and 34 by the mrd suspension technique. fifteen different gram-positive species of four genera were recognised. no fungi were isolated. aerobic endospore-forming bacteria (bacillus  spp. and paenibacillus macerans) were the predominant microflora isolated and at  least one species was isolated from each sample. b. cereus was the most common species and was isolated from 95% of all samples, with b. licheniformis isolated  from 40%. between one and five samples yielded cultures of b. coagulans, b. laterosporus, b. pumilus, b. subtilis and p. macerans. staphylococcus spp. were isolated from 23 (40%) samples; s. warneri and s. epidermidis were the most common and were cultured from 13 (22%) and 6 (10%) samples respectively. one or two samples yielded cultures of s. aureus, s. capitis and s. haemolyticus. the remainder of the flora detected comprised two samples contaminated with c. perfringens and two samples with either c. sordellii or c. tertium. multiple bacterial species were isolated from 43 (74%) samples, a single species from the  remaining 15. in 13 samples b. cereus alone was isolated, in one b. subtilis alone and in one sample b. pumilus alone. c. botulinum and c. novyi were not isolated from any of the heroin samples. recommendations for the optimal examination of the microflora of heroin are given.
