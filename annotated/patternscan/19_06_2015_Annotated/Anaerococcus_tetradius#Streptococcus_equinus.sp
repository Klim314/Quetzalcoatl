TI  == antimicrobial activity of brazilian propolis extracts against rumen bacteria in vitro.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of three brazilian propolis extracts was evaluated on  bacterial strains representing major rumen functional groups. the extracts were prepared using different concentrations of propolis and alcohol, resulting in different phenolic compositions. the propolis extracts inhibited the growth of fibrobacter succinogenes s85, ruminococcus flavefaciens fd-1, ruminococcus albus  7, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens d1, prevotella albensis m384, peptostreptococcus sp. d1, clostridium aminophilum f and streptococcus bovis pearl11, while r. albus 20, prevotella bryantii b(1)4 and ruminobacter amylophilus h18 were resistant to all  the extracts. the inhibited strains showed also different sensitivity to propolis; the hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria (c. aminophilum f and peptostreptococcus sp. d1) being the most sensitive. inhibition of hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria by propolis would be beneficial to the animal. the extract containing the lowest amount of phenolic compounds (llos c3) showed the lowest antimicrobial activity against all the bacteria. the major phenolic compounds identified in the propolis extracts (naringenin, chrysin, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid and artepillin c) were also evaluated on four sensitive strains.  only naringenin showed inhibitory effect against all strains, suggesting that naringenin is one of the components participating to the antibacterial activity of propolis.

TI  == effects of adding polyclonal antibody preparations on ruminal fermentation patterns and digestibility of cows fed different energy sources.
AB  == nine ruminally cannulated cows fed different energy sources were used to evaluate an avian-derived polyclonal antibody preparation (pap-mv) against the specific ruminal bacteria streptococcus bovis, fusobacterium necrophorum, clostridium aminophilum, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and clostridium sticklandii and monensin (mon) on ruminal fermentation patterns and in vivo digestibility. the experimental design was three 3 x 3 latin squares distinguished by the main energy source in the diet [dry-ground corn grain (cg), high-moisture corn silage  (hmcs), or citrus pulp (cipu)]. inside each latin square, animals received one of the feed additives per period [none (con), mon, or pap-mv]. dry matter intake and ruminal fermentation variables such as ph, total short-chain fatty acids (tscfa), which included acetate, propionate, and butyrate, as well as lactic acid and nh(3)-n concentration were analyzed in this trial. total tract dm apparent digestibility and its fractions were estimated using chromic oxide as an external marker. each experimental period lasted 21 d. ruminal fluid sampling was carried  out on the last day of the period at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 h after the morning meal. ruminal ph was higher (p = 0.006) 4 h postfeeding in mon and pap-mv groups when compared with con. acetate:propionate ratio was greater in pap-mv compared with mon across sampling times. polyclonal antibodies did not alter (p > 0.05) tscfa, molar proportion of acetate and butyrate, or lactic acid and nh(3)-n concentration. ruminal ph was higher (p = 0.01), 4 h postfeeding in cipu diets compared with cg and hmcs. there was no interaction between feed additive and energy source (p > 0.05) for any of the digestibility coefficients analyzed. starch digestibility was less (p = 0.008) in pap-mv when compared with con and mon. in relation to energy sources, ndf digestibility was greater (p = 0.007) in  cg and cipu vs. the hmcs diet. the digestibility of adf was greater (p = 0.002) in cipu diets followed by cg and hmcs. feeding pap-mv or monensin altered ruminal fermentation patterns and digestive function in cows; however, those changes were independent of the main energy source of the diet.

TI  == the ability of non-bacteriocin producing streptococcus bovis strains to bind and  transfer bovicin hc5 to other sensitive bacteria.
AB  == streptococcus bovis hc5 produces a broad spectrum lantibiotic (bovicin hc5), but  s. bovis jb1 does not have antimicrobial activity. preliminary experiments revealed an anomaly. when s. bovis jb1 cells were washed in stationary phase s. bovis hc5 cell-free culture supernatant, the s. bovis jb1 cells were subsequently able to inhibit hyper-ammonia producing ruminal bacteria (clostridium sticklandii, clostridium aminophilum and peptostreptococcus anaerobius). other non-bacteriocin producing s. bovis strains also had the ability to bind and transfer semi-purified bovicin hc5. bovicin hc5 that was bound to s. bovis jb1 was much more resistant to pronase e than cell-free bovicin hc5, but it could be  inactivated if the incubation period was 24 h. acidic nacl treatment (100 mm, ph  2.0) liberates half of the bovicin hc5 from s. bovis hc5, but it did not prevent  bovicin hc5 from binding to s. bovis jb1. acidic nacl liberated some bovicin hc5  from s. bovis jb1, but the decrease in activity was only 2-fold. bovicin hc5 is a positively charged peptide, and the ability of s. bovis jb1 to bind bovicin hc5 could be inhibited by either calcium or magnesium (100 mm). acidic nacl-treated s. bovis jb1 cells were unable to accumulate potassium, but they were still able  to bind bovicin hc5 and prevent potassium accumulation by untreated s. bovis jb1  cells. based on these results, bovicin hc5 bound to s. bovis jb1 cells still acts as a pore-forming lantibiotic.

TI  == coaggregation profiles of the microflora from root surface caries lesions.
AB  == bacterial coaggregation reactions between different species and the auto aggregation of the same species are associated with the initiation and development of dental plaque and biofilms. as no such data is available on isolates from root caries lesions, we evaluated, by a visual, semi-quantitative scoring system and a spectrophotometric, quantitative assay, the coaggregation of 22 different wild-type microbial species comprising ten bacterial genera and a single candida spp. the quantitative coaggregation assay we used proved to be a more sensitive method than the semi-quantitative, visual evaluation as the results yielded the percent coaggregation. fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus bovis ii/2 and gemella morbillorum were observed having higher degrees of autoaggregation than the other examined strains. significant levels of inter-species coaggregation was seen between: (1) actinomyces spp. and veillonella spp.; (2) actinomyces israelii and peptostreptococcus prevotii; (3) campylobacter gracilis and actinomyces spp.; (4) prevotella intermedia and nine different species; and (5) fusobacterium nucleatum and six other species. the single candida albicans isolate did not coaggregate to a significant extent with any of the 21 bacterial isolates studied. scanning electron microscopy observation of the coaggregation interactions between bacterial pairs having strong coaggregation reactions revealed varying adhesive patterns. our findings on coaggregation amongst these isolates imply existence of multiple interactions between the coaggregation-inducing bacterial species in root caries. in particular, actinomyces spp., veillonella spp., prevotella spp. and fusobacterium spp. appear to play a significant role in this context.

TI  == the use of pcr for the identification and characterisation of bacteriocin genes from bacterial strains isolated from rumen or caecal contents of cattle and sheep.
AB  == pcr primers were designed to amplify the gene that encodes bovicin 255 from streptococcus gallolyticus lrc0255 and the bacteriocin genes from butyrivibrio fibrisolvens strains ar10 and or79a (bvid and bvi79a) in order to screen for their incidence in rumen and caecal b. fibrisolvens and streptococcus bovis-like  isolates from new zealand and north american ruminants. none of the b. fibrisolvens-like strains (n=34) isolated from new zealand or north america had the genes encoding for butyrivibriocins ar10 (bvid) or or79 (bvi79a). however, seven s. bovis isolates from new zealand ruminants and three from north american  animals had the bovicin 255 gene. sequence comparison of cloned bovicin 255 pcr products indicated a 92.9-95.7% similarity to that of the corresponding bovicin 255 gene sequence of s. gallolyticus. four of the new zealand bovicin 255 positive s. bovis isolates were from the caecal contents of the same sheep and had identical pfge profiles. two other s. bovis isolates sharing the same pfge profile were isolated from a separate animal from the same flock. pfge analysis of the north american strains indicated that all three were closely related as two of three had identical pfge profiles with the remaining isolate differing only by a single band position. the 16s rrna gene sequences of the 10 isolates were at least 99.8% identical to s. bovis. all 10 s. bovis isolates having the gene for bovicin 255 produced bacteriocin activity that inhibited the growth of peptostreptococcus anaerobius d1 in a deferred antagonism plating (dap) assay. certain s. bovis isolates obtained from ruminants have bacteriocin activity associated with a distinct bovicin 255 gene sequence but it appears that bacteriocin production by the rumen anaerobe b. fibrisolvens may be uncommon in strains isolated from cattle and sheep in new zealand.

TI  == phenotypic and phylogenetic characterization of ruminal tannin-tolerant bacteria.
AB  == the 16s rrna sequences and selected phenotypic characteristics were determined for six recently isolated bacteria that can tolerate high levels of hydrolyzable  and condensed tannins. bacteria were isolated from the ruminal contents of animals in different geographic locations, including sardinian sheep (ovis aries), honduran and colombian goats (capra hircus), white-tail deer (odocoileus  virginianus) from upstate new york, and rocky mountain elk (cervus elaphus nelsoni) from oregon. nearly complete sequences of the small-subunit rrna genes,  which were obtained by pcr amplification, cloning, and sequencing, were used for  phylogenetic characterization. comparisons of the 16s rrna of the six isolates showed that four of the isolates were members of the genus streptococcus and were most closely related to ruminal strains of streptococcus bovis and the recently described organism streptococcus gallolyticus. one of the other isolates, a gram-positive rod, clustered with the clostridia in the low-g+c-content group of  gram-positive bacteria. the sixth isolate, a gram-negative rod, was a member of the family enterobacteriaceae in the gamma subdivision of the class proteobacteria. none of the 16s rrna sequences of the tannin-tolerant bacteria examined was identical to the sequence of any previously described microorganism  or to the sequence of any of the other organisms examined in this study. three phylogenetically distinct groups of ruminal bacteria were isolated from four species of ruminants in europe, north america, and south america. the presence of tannin-tolerant bacteria is not restricted by climate, geography, or host animal, although attempts to isolate tannin-tolerant bacteria from cows on low-tannin diets failed.

TI  == polymicrobial brain abscess in a patient infected with human immunodeficiency virus.
AB  == although intracranial mass lesions that occur as a result of infection have commonly been reported in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus, polymicrobial pyogenic brain abscess has not been described in this setting. we report the first case of a patient with a polymicrobial brain abscess involving streptococcus bovis, fusobacterium necrophorum, peptostreptococcus, and group g streptococcus, and we review the relevant world literature.

TI  == in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500) against a large collection of infrequently isolated or tested species.
AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500, synercid) is a parenteral streptogramin combination antimicrobial that possesses a synergistic and often bactericidal action against many grampositive species. in this study, a collection of 1270 uncommonly isolated or tested strains were evaluated for susceptibility to quinupristin/dalfopristin using agar dilution minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) methods described in the national committe for clinical laboratory standards. the greatest antimicrobial activity observed for quinupristin/dalfopristin was against staphylococci, streptococci, the pathogenic neisseria, legionella spp., lactobacillus spp., and peptostreptococcus spp. (mic90 range, 0.5-2 micrograms/ml). marginal activity (mic90s, 4 to 8 micrograms/ml) was identified for the rarer enterococci, leuconostoc spp., pediococcus spp., and streptococcus bovis. against haemophilus parainfluenzae, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, fusobacterium spp., and prevotella spp., the streptogramin was inactive. although no susceptible breakpoint has been approved  for quinupristin/dalfopristin, three possible breakpoints (< or = 1, < or = 2, or < or = 4 micrograms/ml) were evaluated. acceptance of the lower breakpoints (< or = 1 or < or = 2 micrograms/ml) would limit quinupristin/dalfopristin use to staphylococci, streptococci, gonococci, meningococci, and legionella spp. these results markedly expand the understanding of the usable spectrum of quinupristin/dalfopristin.

TI  == fermentation of peptides and amino acids by a monensin-sensitive ruminal peptostreptococcus.
AB  == a monensin-sensitive ruminal peptostreptococcus was able to grow rapidly (growth  rate of 0.5/h) on an enzymatic hydrolysate of casein, but less than 23% of the amino acid nitrogen was ever utilized. when an acid hydrolysate was substituted for the enzymatic digest, more than 31% of the nitrogen was converted to ammonia  and cell protein. coculture experiments and synergisms with peptide-degrading strains of bacteroides ruminicola and streptococcus bovis indicated that the peptostreptococcus was unable to transport certain peptides or hydrolyze them extracellularly. leucine, serine, phenylalanine, threonine, and glutamine were deaminated at rates of 349, 258, 102, 95, and 91 nmol/mg of protein per min, respectively. deamination rates for some other amino acids were increased when the amino acids were provided as pairs of oxidized and reduced amino acids (stickland reactions), but these rates were still less than 80 nmol/mg of protein per min. in continuous culture (dilution rate of 0.1/h), bacterial dry matter and ammonia production decreased dramatically at a ph of less than 6.0. when dilution rates were increased from 0.08 to 0.32/h (ph 7.0), ammonia production increased while production of bacterial dry matter and protein decreased. these rather peculiar kinetics resulted in a slightly negative estimate of maintenance energy  and could not be explained by a change in fermentation products. approximately 80% of the cell dry matter was protein. when corrections were made for cell composition, the yield of atp was higher than the theoretical maximum value. it is possible that mechanisms other than substrate-level phosphorylation contributed to the energetics of growth.

TI  == in vitro activity of flurithromycin, a novel macrolide antibiotic.
AB  == flurithromycin is an (8,s)-8-fluoroerythromycin isolated from the fermentation broth of streptomyces erythraeus atcc 31772, a blocked mutant of a strain producer of erythromycin. its in vitro antibacterial activity has been determined on recent clinical isolates of respiratory pathogens. the range of mic for streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus beta-haemolyticus group a is from 0.0015 to 0.006 microgram/ml, for haemophilus influenzae from 0.012 to 0.4 microgram/ml, for staphylococcus aureus from 0.1 to 3.1 micrograms/ml. its action is bacteriostatic and increases at alkaline ph. among anaerobes clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, other species of bacteroides and peptostreptococcus are particularly susceptible. flurithromycin also showed some  activity on mycobacterium bovis, m. scrofulaceum and m. phley. the determination  of killing curves indicated that in most cases a killing effect was obtained at 4 x mic. a combination of flurithromycin with ampicillin or doxycycline sometimes was synergic, but more often additive and never antagonistic. the possible interference of flurithromycin on some parameters of the natural system of defense was determined. at concentrations equal to therapeutic levels in blood and tissues, flurithromycin did not influence chemotaxis, phagocytosis, metabolic activation and the killing activity of neutrophils.

TI  == circulating antibodies after experimental chronic infection in the root canal of  teeth in monkeys.
AB  == root canals of 49 teeth with necrotic pulp tissue in five monkeys were infected with streptococcus faecalis ss liquefaciens, actinomyces bovis, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and bacteroides oralis in various combinations. after 6 months the root canals and the periapical tissues were subjected to radiographic, bacteriologic, and histologic examinations. signs of periapical inflammation were radiographically registered in 41 teeth, most frequently in teeth inoculated with a mixed flora. in 11 out of 16 teeth infected separately with strep. faecalis ss liquefaciens, apical periodontitis was observed. sera from the monkeys prior to and after the experimental inoculation were analyzed by means of gel diffusion, hemagglutination (ha), and complement binding test for antibodies against different antigen preparations of the homologous bacterial strains used for the inoculation. detectable antibodies were seen with antigens of b. oralis in all five monkeys. agglutinating antibodies were demonstrated with lipopolysaccharide-antigen of b. oralis in titers between  1:40 and 1:320. a marked reduction of the antibody level against lipopolysaccharide (lps) antigen after mercaptoethanol treatment indicated that a main part of the antibodies registered was of igm-class. the study shows that certain antigens of bacterial origin from infected root canals, while affecting the periapical tissues, also stimulate the production of circulating antibodies.

TI  == enzymatic studies of pure cultures of rumen microorganisms.
AB  == joyner, a. e., jr. (university of california, davis), and r. l. baldwin. enzymatic studies of pure cultures of rumen microorganisms. j. bacteriol. 92:1321-1330. 1966.-the activities of enzymes representing the major pathways of  carbohydrate metabolism and anaerobic electron transport in cell-free extracts of whole rumen contents have been reported. the effects of diet upon the activities  of several enzymes suggested that enzymatic measurements might prove useful for the study of rumen metabolism. in the present study, the distribution and characteristics of aldolase, succinate dehydrogenase, glutamate dehydrogenase, lactyl-coenzyme a dehydrase, lactate dehydrogenase, and other enzymes were measured in cell-free extracts of pure cultures of ruminococcus flavefaciens, r.  albus, bacteroides succinogenes, b. ruminicola, b. amylophilus, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, peptostreptococcus elsdenii, streptococcus bovis, and selenomonas ruminantium. some enzymes were widely distributed (aldolase, glutamate dehydrogenase), whereas others were observed in one or two species (lactyl-coenzyme a dehydrase). the cofactor requirements and kinetic characteristics of enzymes varied considerably with species. enzymes that vary with species might be employed as indices for estimating the activities of various groups of microorganisms in whole rumen contents.
