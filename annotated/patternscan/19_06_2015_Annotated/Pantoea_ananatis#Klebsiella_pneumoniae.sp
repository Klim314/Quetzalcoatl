TI  == identification of pantoea ananatis gene encoding membrane pyrroloquinoline quinone (pqq)-dependent glucose dehydrogenase and pqqabcdef operon essential for  pqq biosynthesis.
AB  == pantoea ananatis accumulates gluconate during aerobic growth in the presence of glucose. computer analysis of the p. ananatis sc17(0) sequenced genome revealed an orf encoding a homologue (named gcd) of the mgdh (ec 1.1.99.17) apoenzyme from escherichia coli and a putative pyrroloquinoline quinone (pqq) biosynthetic operon homologous to pqqabcdef from klebsiella pneumoniae. construction of deltagcd and deltapqq mutants of p. ananatis confirmed the proposed functions of  these genetic elements. the p. ananatis pqqabcdef was cloned in vivo and integrated into the chromosomes of p. ananatis and e. coli according to the dual  in/out strategy. introduction of a second copy of pqqabcdef to p. ananatis sc17(0) doubled the accumulation of pqq. integration of the operon into e. coli mg1655deltaptsgdeltamanxy restored the growth of bacteria on glucose. the obtained data show the essential role of pqqabcdef in pqq biosynthesis in p. ananatis and e. coli. we propose that the cloned operon could be useful for an efficient phosphoenolpyruvate-independent glucose consumption pathway due to glucose oxidation and construction of e. coli strains with the advantage of phosphoenolpyruvate-derived metabolite production.

TI  == potential for nezara viridula (hemiptera: pentatomidae) to transmit bacterial and fungal pathogens into cotton bolls.
AB  == recently, we showed that the southern green stink bug (sgsb), nezara viridula (l.), can transmit pantoea agglomerans (ewing and fife), an opportunistic bacterium, into green cotton bolls resulting in plant disease. here, we hypothesized that our established model could be used to determine if the sgsb was a general, non-discriminate vector by using two other opportunistic bacterial pathogens of bolls (pantoea ananatis [serano] and klebsiella pneumoniae [schroeter]) and the known fungal pathogen nematospora coryli (peglion). variants of p. ananatis (strain pa-1r) and k. pneumoniae (strain kp 5-1r) selected for rifampicin (rif) resistance were used as bacterial opportunists. n. coryli was detected only from laboratory-reared sgsb directly exposed to the fungus. both pa-1r and kp 5-1r were recovered from sgsb previously provided a contaminated food source (2 days), sterile food (5 days), and then harvested after being caged on bolls (2 days) at levels reaching 10(3) and 10(4) colony forming units (cfus)  per insect, respectively. however, bolls caged with insects infected with pa-1r or kp 5-1r and with evidence of feeding did not become diseased nor were either opportunists detected from boll tissues. insects infected with n. coryli transmitted the pathogen, which resulted in diseased bolls and fungi concentrations reached 10(6) cfus/g locule tissue at 2 weeks following the caging period. notably, each of the three pathogens independently caused boll disease when mechanically inoculated using a needle puncture. generally, these results suggest that cotton pathogen acquisition by the sgsb was not sufficient to determine whether the insects were disease vectors of the opportunists.
