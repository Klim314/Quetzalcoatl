TI  == haemophilus species
AB  == the genus haemophilus includes a number of species that cause a wide variety of infections but share a common morphology and a requirement for blood-derived factors during growth that has given the genus its name. haemophilus influenzae,  the major pathogen, can be separated into encapsulated or typable strains, of which there are seven types (a through f including e') based on the antigenic structure of the capsular polysaccharide, and unencapsulated or nontypable strains. type b h influenzae is by far the most virulent organism in this group,  commonly causing bloodstream invasion and meningitis in children younger than 2 years. nontypable strains are frequent causes of respiratory tract disease in infants, children, and adults. other haemophilus species cause disease less frequently. haemophilus parainfluenzae sometimes causes pneumonia or bacterial endocarditis. haemophilus ducreyi causes chancroid. haemophilus aphrophilus is a  member of the normal flora of the mouth and occasionally causes bacterial endocarditis. haemophilus aegyptius, which causes conjunctivitis and brazilian purpuric fever, and haemophilus haemolyticus used to be separated on the basis of their ability to agglutinate or lyse red blood cells, but both are now included among the nontypable h influenzae strains.

TI  == phylogeny of 54 representative strains of species in the family pasteurellaceae as determined by comparison of 16s rrna sequences.
AB  == virtually complete 16s rrna sequences were determined for 54 representative strains of species in the family pasteurellaceae. of these strains, 15 were pasteurella, 16 were actinobacillus, and 23 were haemophilus. a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on sequence similarity, using the neighbor-joining method.  fifty-three of the strains fell within four large clusters. the first cluster included the type strains of haemophilus influenzae, h. aegyptius, h. aphrophilus, h. haemolyticus, h. paraphrophilus, h. segnis, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. this cluster also contained a. actinomycetemcomitans fdc y4, atcc 29522, atcc 29523, and atcc 29524 and h. aphrophilus nctc 7901. the second cluster included the type strains of a. seminis and pasteurella aerogenes  and h. somnus ovcg 43826. the third cluster was composed of the type strains of pasteurella multocida, p. anatis, p. avium, p. canis, p. dagmatis, p. gallinarum, p. langaa, p. stomatis, p. volantium, h. haemoglobinophilus, h. parasuis, h. paracuniculus, h. paragallinarum, and a. capsulatus. this cluster also contained  pasteurella species a ccug 18782, pasteurella species b ccug 19974, haemophilus taxon c capm 5111, h. parasuis type 5 nagasaki, p. volantium (h. parainfluenzae)  nctc 4101, and p. trehalosi nctc 10624. the fourth cluster included the type strains of actinobacillus lignieresii, a. equuli, a. pleuropneumoniae, a. suis, a. ureae, h. parahaemolyticus, h. parainfluenzae, h. paraphrohaemolyticus, h. ducreyi, and p. haemolytica. this cluster also contained actinobacillus species strain ccug 19799 (bisgaard taxon 11), a. suis atcc 15557, h. ducreyi atcc 27722  and hd 35000, haemophilus minor group strain 202, and h. parainfluenzae atcc 29242. the type strain of p. pneumotropica branched alone to form a fifth group.  the branching of the pasteurellaceae family tree was quite complex. the four major clusters contained multiple subclusters. the clusters contained both rapidly and slowly evolving strains (indicated by differing numbers of base changes incorporated into the 16s rrna sequence relative to outgroup organisms).  while the results presented a clear picture of the phylogenetic relationships, the complexity of the branching will make division of the family into genera a difficult and somewhat subjective task. we do not suggest any taxonomic changes at this time.

TI  == distribution of protein d, an immunoglobulin d-binding protein, in haemophilus strains.
AB  == protein d, a novel surface protein of the bacterial species haemophilus influenzae with specific affinity for human immunoglobulin (ig) d was detected in all 127 h. influenzae strains studied. all strains representing different serotypes of encapsulated strains and different biotypes of nonencapsulated strains bound 125i-labeled igd to a high degree (38 to 74%). sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blot (immunoblot) analysis showed that protein d from all h. influenzae strains had the same apparent molecular weight (i.e., 42,000) and reacted with all three different anti-protein d monoclonal antibodies. by scatchard analysis, the number of protein d residues  on a nontypeable h. influenzae strain was estimated to be approximately 2,800 per organism. the equilibrium constant for the reaction between a human igd myeloma protein and igd was found to be 5.8 x 10(8) m-1. also, all strains of h. haemolyticus and h. aegypticus strains tested bound igd, 21 to 28% and 41 to 48%, respectively. in extracts of those bacteria, a 42,000-molecular-weight protein reactive with igd and all three anti-protein d monoclonal antibodies was found. in h. parainfluenzae, h. aphrophilus, h. paraphrophilus, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, a 42,000-molecular-weight protein that was reactive with one to three of three anti-protein d monoclonal antibodies but not reactive with  human igd was detected with western blot analysis. other haemophilus species (h.  ducreyi, h. parasuis, h. parahaemolyticus, h. segnis, and h. haemoglobinophilus)  did not react with human monoclonal igd or anti-protein d antibodies. on the basis of the wide distribution of protein d among h. influenzae strains, we suggest that protein d could be a vaccine candidate.

TI  == cellular fatty acid composition of haemophilus species, pasteurella multocida, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and haemophilus vaginalis (corynebacterium vaginale).
AB  == the fatty acid composition of 35 haemophilus influenzae strains was found to be grossly similar and characterized by relatively large amounts of 14:0, 3-oh-14:0, 16:1 and 16:0. the three c18 fatty acids 18:2, 18:1 and 18:0 were also present, but in much lower concentrations. this general pattern was also found for most of the other species of haemophilus examined (h. aegyptius, h. aphrophilus, h. canis, h. gallinarum, h. haemolyticus, and h. parainfluenzae). small but distinct quantitative discrepancies were detected for h. ducreyi and the haemin-independent species h. paraphrohaemolyticus, h. paraphrophilus and h. suis. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was found to be indistinguishable from h. influenzae. pasteurella multocida also exhibited a fatty acid pattern closely  related to that of haemophilus, but could be distinguished by its higher concentration levels of the c18 fatty acids. the fatty acid pattern of h. vaginalis was considerably different from those of the other species examined. this species lacked 3-oh-14:0 and 18:2 and contained small amounts of 14:0 and 16:0, whereas 18:1 and 18:0 were the major constituents.
