TI  - Mucin2 is required for probiotic agents-mediated blocking effects on meningitic E. coli-induced pathogenicities.
AB  - Mucin2 (MUC2), an important regulatory factor in the immune system, plays an important role in the host defense system against bacterial translocation. Probiotics known to regulate MUC2 gene expression has been widely studied, but the interactions among probiotic, pathogens, and mucin gene are still not fully understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of MUC2 in blocking effects of probiotics on Meningitic E. coli-induced pathogenicities. In this study, live combined probiotic tablets containing living Bifidobacterium, lactobacillus bulgaricus, and streptococcus thermophilus were used. MUC2 expression was knocked down in Caco-2 cells by RNAi (RNA interference). 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR), which enhances mucin-promoted probiotic effects through inducing production of S- adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe), was used to up-regulate of MUC2 expression in Caco-2 cells. The adhesion to and invasion of meningitic E. coli were detected by competition assays. Our studies showed that probiotic agents could block E. coli- caused intestinal colonization, bacteremia and meningitis in a neonatal sepsis and meningitis (NSM) rat model. MUC2 gene expression in the neonatal rats given probiotic agents was obviously higher than that of the infected and uninfected control groups without probiotic treatment. The prohibitive effects of probiotic agents on MUC2 knockdown Caco-2 cells infected with E44 were significantly reduced compared to nontransfected Caco-2 cells. Moreover, the results also showed that 5- Aza-CdR, a drug enhancing production of SAMe which is a protective agent of probioticswas able to significantly suppress adhesion and invasion of E44 to Caco- 2 cells by up-regulation of MUC2 expression. Taken together, our data suggest that probiotic agents can efficiently block Meningitic E. coli-induced pathogenicities in a manner dependent on MUC2.
TI  - Enhanced Heavy Metal Tolerance and Accumulation by Transgenic Sugar Beets Expressing Streptococcus thermophilus StGCS-GS in the Presence of Cd, Zn and Cu Alone or in Combination.
AB  - Phytoremediation is a promising means of ameliorating heavy metal pollution through the use of transgenic plants as artificial hyperaccumulators. A novel Streptococcus thermophilus gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase-glutathione synthetase (StGCS-GS) that synthesizes glutathione (GSH) with limited feedback inhibition was overexpressed in sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.), yielding three transgenic lines (s2, s4 and s5) with enhanced tolerance to different concentrations of cadmium, zinc and copper, as indicated by their increased biomass, root length and relative growth compared with wild-type plants. Transgenic sugar beets accumulated more Cd, Zn and Cu ions in shoots than wild-type, as well as higher GSH and phytochelatin (PC) levels under different heavy metal stresses. This enhanced heavy metal tolerance and increased accumulation were likely due to the increased expression of StGCS-GS and consequent overproduction of both GSH and PC. Furthermore, when multiple heavy metal ions were present at the same time, transgenic sugar beets overexpressing StGCS-GS resisted two or three of the metal combinations (50 muM Cd-Zn, Cd-Cu, Zn-Cu and Cd-Zn-Cu), with greater absorption in shoots. Additionally, there was no obvious competition between metals. Overall, the results demonstrate the explicit role of StGCS-GS in enhancing Cd, Zn and Cu tolerance and accumulation in transgenic sugar beet, which may represent a highly promising new tool for phytoremediation.
TI  - Impact of Cell-free Supernatant of Lactic Acid Bacteria on Putrescine and Other Polyamine Formation by Foodborne Pathogens in Ornithine Decarboxylase Broth.
AB  - Conversion of ornithine to putrescine by Salmonella Paratyphi A, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli was investigated in ornithine decarboxylase broth (ODB) using cell-free supernatants (CFSs) obtained from Leuconostoc mesenterodies subsp. cremoris, Pediococcus acidilactici, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus. Two groups of cell-free supernatants (25 or 50%) and control (only ODB) were prepared to investigate putrescine (PUT) and other polyamine formation by foodborne pathogens (FBPs). Significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed among the species for each amine. All of the CFSs reduced the formation of PUT by >/=65%. The production of cadaverine (CAD) was scarcely affected by the presence of CFSs, with the exception of the samples inoculated with L. monocytogenes. The variation in polyamine was found with respect to the control samples. Spermidine (SPD) was produced in lower amount in many samples, especially in Gram-negative FBPs, whereas spermine (SPN) increased drastically in the major part of the samples concerning the control. Histamine (HIS) was characterized by a marked concentration decrease in all of the samples, and tyramine (TYR) was accumulated in very low concentrations in the controls. Therefore, the ability of bacteria to produce certain biogenic amines such as HIS, TYR, PUT, and CAD has been studied to assess their risk and prevent their formation in food products. The results obtained from this study concluded that the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains with non-decarboxylase activity are capable of avoiding or limiting biogenic amine formation by FBP.
TI  - Streptococcus thermophilus Biofilm Formation: A Remnant Trait of Ancestral Commensal Life?
AB  - Microorganisms have a long history of use in food production and preservation. Their adaptation to food environments has profoundly modified their features, mainly through genomic flux. Streptococcus thermophilus, one of the most frequent starter culture organisms consumed daily by humans emerged recently from a commensal ancestor. As such, it is a useful model for genomic studies of bacterial domestication processes. Many streptococcal species form biofilms, a key feature of the major lifestyle of these bacteria in nature. However, few descriptions of S. thermophilus biofilms have been reported. An analysis of the ability of a representative collection of natural isolates to form biofilms revealed that S. thermophilus was a poor biofilm producer and that this characteristic was associated with an inability to attach firmly to surfaces. The identification of three biofilm-associated genes in the strain producing the most biofilms shed light on the reasons for the rarity of this trait in this species. These genes encode proteins involved in crucial stages of biofilm formation and are heterogeneously distributed between strains. One of the biofilm genes appears to have been acquired by horizontal transfer. The other two are located in loci presenting features of reductive evolution, and are absent from most of the strains analyzed. Their orthologs in commensal bacteria are involved in adhesion to host cells, suggesting that they are remnants of ancestral functions. The biofilm phenotype appears to be a commensal trait that has been lost during the genetic domestication of S. thermophilus, consistent with its adaptation to the milk environment and the selection of starter strains for dairy fermentations.
TI  - Proteolytic and antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria grown in goat milk.
AB  - We examined 62 strains and 21 trade starter cultures from the collection of LB Bulgaricum PLC for proteolytic and antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) grown in goat milk. The aim of this study was to investigate the fermentation of caseins, alpha-lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin by LAB, using the o-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) spectrophotometric assay and sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The proteolysis targeted mainly caseins, especially beta-casein. Whey proteins were proteolyzed, essentially beta-lactoglobulin. The proteolytic activity of Lactococcus lactis l598, Streptococcus thermophilus t3D1, Dt1, Lactobacillus lactis 1043 and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus b38, b122 and b24 was notably high. The proteolysis process gave rise to medium-sized peptide populations. Most of the examined strains showed antimicrobial activity against some food pathogens, such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella cholere enteridis, Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria innocua and Enterobacter aerogenes. The most active producers of antimicrobial-active peptides were strains of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus, which are of practical importance. The starter cultures containing the examined species showed high proteolytic and antimicrobial activity in skimmed goat milk. The greatest antimicrobial activity of the cultures was detected against E. aerogenes. The obtained results demonstrated the significant proteolytic potential of the examined strains in goat milk and their potential for application in the production of dairy products from goat's milk. The present results could be considered as the first data on the proteolytic capacity of strains and starter cultures in goat milk for the purposes of trade interest of LB Bulgaricum PLC.
TI  - Selection and characterization of naturally occurring high acidification rate strains.
AB  - Among Streptococcus thermophilus cultures, the principle component of yoghurt and cheese starters, a minority of strains forms the group of 'H'-strains which show an unusually high acidification rate, grow faster and coagulate milk 3-5 hours earlier than the typical S. thermophilus cultures. A large-scale screening study was performed to select 'H'-strains of S. thermophilus from more than 100 samples of home-made yoghurt, industrial yoghurt starters and single cultures, maintained in the LBB culture collection. Only four strains - LBB.TN1, LBB.M23, LBB.M34 and LBB.M60 - were isolated/selected due to their ability to form large yellowish colonies on milk agar, supplemented with beta-glycerophosphate and bromocresol purple. While in general S. thermophilus is described as a species with limited proteolytic capacity and in contrast to all other tested S. thermophilus cultures, the four selected strains invariably gave positive amplification product with the polymerase chain reaction when primers, specific for the membrane proteinase-coding gene prtS were used. The macrorestriction profiles of the genomic DNA of the four strains confirmed that they are non-isogenic and not related to each other. When grown in milk and compared to the control industrial strain LBB.A, the four strains showed a dramatically faster acidification, coagulating milk within four hours. The application of strain TN1 or M23 as adjunct culture to industrial yoghurt starter LBB.BY5-12 resulted in shortening the fermentation time with more than 30 min.
TI  - Fermented Infant Formula Increases Ileal Protein Digestibility and Reduces Ileal  Proteolytic Activity Compared with Standard and Hydrolyzed Infant Formula in Piglets.
AB  - BACKGROUND: An infant formula that contained milk fermented by the bacteria Bifidobacterium breve and Streptococcus thermophilus (Lactofidus) was reported to alleviate functional digestive symptoms in infants. It was hypothesized that improved protein digestibility of the fermented infant formula could contribute to this effect. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the protein digestibility of a specific fermented (FF), standard (SF), and an extensively hydrolyzed protein (HF) formula. METHODS: Four-week-old piglets (n = 7) were fitted with a T-cannula at the terminal ileum and received each formula in a Latin square design. FF, SF, and HF contained 11.7%, 9.3%, and 11.9% (w/w) crude protein; 1.5%, 5.4%, and 5.6% (w/w) fiber; and had a casein/whey ratio of 60:40, 50:50, and 0:100 per kilogram of powder, respectively. Ileal digesta were collected and analyzed for amino acids and proteolytic activity. RESULTS: FF had a significantly higher apparent ileal crude protein digestibility (92.1% +/- 1.0%) than SF and HF (84.4% +/- 1.0% and 83.9% +/- 0.9%, respectively). FF also had a significantly higher dry matter digestibility than SF and HF. The ileal crude protein flow of FF was significantly lower than that of SF and HF. The ileal flow of FF of total proteolytic activity was significantly lower than that of SF but not significantly different from that of HF (412 +/- 163 kU/8 h vs. 1530 +/- 163 and 703 +/- 156 kU/8 h, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The FF in piglets had a significantly higher apparent ileal crude protein digestibility than the SF and the HF and displayed lower ileal proteolytic activity than SF. Both effects may contribute to the alleviation of functional gastrointestinal symptoms reported in infants fed fermented infant milk formula.
TI  - Study on Streptococcus thermophilus isolated from Qula and associated characteristic of acetaldehyde and diacetyl in their fermented milk.
AB  - In this study, the lactic acid bacterial population of Qula cheese from the Gansu and Sichuan provinces of China were isolated and identified. Eight strains of Streptococcus thermophilus were isolated, of which five strains were selected for further characterization based on their fermentation properties. The changes in a number of parameters, including titration acidity, pH, viable counts, PrtS protease activity and the production of acetaldehyde, diacetyl and organic acid, were monitored during fermentation and the storage of fermented milks produced by the respective strain. All of the strains displaying acidifying capacity and all five fermented milks maintained high viable counts of S. thermophilus from fermentation to storage. Our study found that the changes in the monitored parameters were strain-specific and varied considerably among the five tested strains. Fermented milks produced by strain IMAU80809 had the highest concentration of acetaldehyde and were most favorable in the sensory evaluation. This study confirms that Qula cheese is a good source for isolating novel lactic acid bacterial strains with different fermentation properties, which will be very useful for further development and industrialization of traditionally fermented dairy products.
TI  - Complete Genome Sequence of Streptococcus thermophilus SMQ-301, a Model Strain for Phage-Host Interactions.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus is used by the dairy industry to manufacture yogurt and several cheeses. Using PacBio and Illumina platforms, we sequenced the genome of S. thermophilus SMQ-301, the host of several virulent phages. The genome is composed of 1,861,792 bp and contains 2,037 genes, 67 tRNAs, and 18 rRNAs.
TI  - Cas3 nuclease-helicase activity assays.
AB  - Cas3 is a signature protein of the type I CRISPR-Cas systems and typically contains HD phosphohydrolase and Superfamily 2 (SF2) helicase domains. In the type I CRISPR-Cas systems Cas3 functions as a slicer that provides foreign DNA degradation. Biochemical analysis indicate that Cas3 of the Streptococcus thermophilus DGCC7710 (St-Cas3) CRISPR4 system is a single-stranded DNA nuclease which also possesses a single-stranded DNA-stimulated ATPase activity, which is coupled to unwinding of DNA/DNA and RNA/DNA duplexes in 3' to 5' direction. The interplay between the nuclease and ATPase/helicase activities of St-Cas3 results in DNA degradation. Here, we describe assays for monitoring of St-Cas3 nuclease, ATPase and helicase activities in a stand-alone form and in the presence of the Cascade ribonucleoprotein complex. These assays can be easily adapted for biochemical analysis of Cas3 proteins from different microorganisms.
TI  - Procedures for Generating CRISPR Mutants with Novel Spacers Acquired from Viruses or Plasmids.
AB  - CRISPR-Cas systems provide immunity in bacteria and archaea against nucleic acids in the form of viral genomes and plasmids, and influence their coevolution. The first main step of CRISPR-Cas activity is the immune adaptation through spacer(s) acquisition into an active CRISPR locus. This step is also mandatory for the final stage of CRISPR-Cas activity, namely interference. This chapter describes general procedures for studying the CRISPR adaptation step, accomplished by producing bacteriophage-insensitive mutants (BIMs) or plasmid-interfering mutants (PIMs) using various spacer acquisition analyses and experiments. Since each bacterial or archaeal species (and even strain) needs specific conditions to optimize the acquisition process, the protocols described below should be thought of as general guidelines and may not be applicable universally, without modification.Because Streptococcus thermophilus was used as the model system in the first published study on novel spacer acquisition and in many studies ever since, the protocols in this chapter describe specific conditions, media, and buffers that have been used with this microorganism. Details for other species will be given when possible, but readers should first evaluate the best growth and storage conditions for each bacterium-foreign element pair (named the procedure settings) and bear in mind the specificity and variability of CRISPR-Cas types and subtypes. Also, we suggest to be mindful of the fact that some CRISPR-Cas systems are not "naturally" active in terms of the ability to acquire novel CRISPR spacers, and that some systems may require specific conditions to induce the CRISPR-Cas activity for spacer acquisition.
TI  - CRISPR immunity drives rapid phage genome evolution in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Many bacteria rely on CRISPR-Cas systems to provide adaptive immunity against phages, predation by which can shape the ecology and functioning of microbial communities. To characterize the impact of CRISPR immunization on phage genome evolution, we performed long-term bacterium-phage (Streptococcus thermophilus-phage 2972) coevolution experiments. We found that in this species, CRISPR immunity drives fixation of single nucleotide polymorphisms that accumulate exclusively in phage genome regions targeted by CRISPR. Mutation rates in phage genomes highly exceed those of the host. The presence of multiple phages increased phage persistence by enabling recombination-based formation of chimeric phage genomes in which sequences heavily targeted by CRISPR were replaced. Collectively, our results establish CRISPR-Cas adaptive immunity as a key driver of phage genome evolution under the conditions studied and highlight the importance of multiple coexisting phages for persistence in natural systems. IMPORTANCE: Phages remain an enigmatic part of the biosphere. As predators, they challenge the survival of host bacteria and archaea and set off an "arms race" involving host immunization countered by phage mutation. The CRISPR-Cas system is adaptive: by capturing fragments of a phage genome upon exposure, the host is positioned to counteract future infections. To investigate this process, we initiated massive deep-sequencing experiments with a host and infective phage and tracked the coevolution of both populations over hundreds of days. In the present study, we found that CRISPR immunity drives the accumulation of phage genome rearrangements (which enable longer phage survival) and escape mutations, establishing CRISPR as one of the fundamental drivers of phage evolution.
TI  - Standardization of the method for utilization of paneer whey in cultured buttermilk.
AB  - Whey is a liquid by-product obtained during manufacture of coagulated milk products like paneer, cheese etc. Its disposal as waste leads to heavy load in dairy effluent and loss of valuable milk solids. For efficient and economic utilization of whey, a method was standardized for the preparation of cultured butter milk using paneer whey as one of the ingredient. It involved fermentation of paneer whey and double toned milk separately using starter culture containing Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. The paneeer whey can be successfully incorporated up to 50 % by following the standardized method. The proximate chemical composition of cultured buttermilk was 8.31 % total solids, 2.26 % protein, 1.12 % fat, 4.42 % lactose and 0.56 % ash. The cultured buttermilk has acceptable sensory qualities and shelf life of 5 days under refrigerated condition.
TI  - Lactobacillus gasseri SBT2055 suppresses fatty acid release through enlargement of fat emulsion size in vitro and promotes fecal fat excretion in healthy Japanese subjects.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactobacillus gasseri SBT2055 (LG2055) has been shown to prevent abdominal adiposity, and suppression of lipid absorption is considered a possible mechanism, detail of which, however, are poorly understood. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of LG2055 on fat hydrolysis by determining pancreatic lipase activity and fat emulsion properties in vitro. We also examined whether LG2055 influences fecal fat excretion in humans. METHODS: Pancreatic lipase activity was investigated in vitro using an artificially prepared fat emulsion and 4-methylumbelliferyl oleate (4-MUO) as substrates. The concentrations of free fatty acids and 4-methylumbelliferone were quantified. Fat emulsion droplet size was measured using a particle size analyzer. The clinical study was performed as a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Subjects consumed 100 g of fermented milk (FM)/d, either with or without LG2055 supplementation, for seven days. Fecal samples were collected during three-day pre-observational and FM intake periods and fecal fat levels were determined. RESULTS: LG2055 dose-dependently suppressed lipase activity in the fat emulsion assay but not in the 4-MUO assay. LG2055 dose-dependently increased fat emulsion droplet size. The effects of LG2055 on lipase activity and fat emulsion properties were increased compared with four other tested strains (Lactobacillus gasseri SBT0317, Lactobacillus gasseri JCM1131T, Lactobacillus. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus JCM1002T and Streptococcus thermophilus ATCC19258T). In our clinical study, fecal fat level after FM intake was significantly increased compared with that observed before FM intake in the LG2055-containing active FM group but not the control FM group lacking LG2055. CONCLUSIONS: LG2055 increased fat emulsion droplet size, resulting in the suppression of lipase-mediated fat hydrolysis. The influence of LG2055 on the physicochemical properties of fat emulsion provides a mechanism for the probiotic-mediated suppression of lipid absorption and promotion of fecal fat excretion in humans.

TI  - A combination of probiotics and whey proteins enhances anti-obesity effects of calcium and dairy products during nutritional energy restriction in aP2-agouti transgenic mice.
AB  - Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus paracasei TMC0409, Streptococcus thermophilus TMC1543 and whey proteins were used to prepare fermented milk. For the experiment aP2- agouti transgenic mice were pre-treated with a high-sucrose/high-fat diet for 6 weeks to induce obesity. The obese mice were fed a diet containing 1.2 % Ca and either non-fat dried milk (NFDM) or probiotic-fermented milk (PFM) with nutritional energy restriction for 6 weeks. The animals were examined after the treatment for changes in body weight, fat pad weight, fatty acid synthase (FAS) activity, lypolysis, the expression levels of genes related to lipid metabolism, insulin sensitivity in adipocytes and skeletal muscle and the presence of biomarkers for oxidative and inflammatory stress in plasma. It was found that the PFM diet significantly reduced body weight, fat accumulation, and adipocyte FAS activity, and increased adipocyte lipolysis as compared with the effects of the NFDM diet (P< 0.05). The adipose tissue gene expression of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (11beta-HSD1) was significantly suppressed in mice that were fed PFM as compared with those that were fed NFDM (P< 0.05). PFM caused a greater up-regulation of skeletal muscle PPARalpha, PPARdelta, uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) and GLUT4 expression and a significant decrease in the plasma concentration of insulin, malondialdehyde, TNF-alpha, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and C-reactive protein as compared with the effects of NFDM (P< 0.05). Fermentation of milk with selected probiotics and supplementation of milk with whey proteins may thus enhance anti-obesity effects of Ca and dairy products by the suppression of adipose tissue lipogenesis, activation of fat oxidation in skeletal muscle and reduction of oxidative and inflammatory stress.
TI  - Bacteria and yeast microbiota in milk kefir grains from different Italian regions.
AB  - Kefir grains are a unique symbiotic association of different microrganisms, mainly lactic acid bacteria, yeasts and occasionally acetic acid bacteria, cohabiting in a natural polysaccharide and a protein matrix. The microbial composition of kefir grains can be considered as extremely variable since it is strongly influenced by the geographical origin of the grains and by the sub-culturing method used. The aim of this study was to elucidate the bacteria and yeast species occurring in milk kefir grains collected in some Italian regions by combining the results of scanning electron microscopy analysis, viable counts on selective culture media, PCR-DGGE and pyrosequencing. The main bacterial species found was Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens while Dekkera anomala was the predominant yeast. The presence of sub-dominant species ascribed to Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis and Acetobacter genera was also highlighted. In addition, Lc. lactis, Enterococcus sp., Bacillus sp., Acetobacter fabarum, Acetobacter lovaniensis and Acetobacter orientalis were identified as part of the cultivable community. This work further confirms both the importance of combining culture-independent and culture-dependent approaches to study microbial diversity in food and how the combination of multiple 16S rRNA gene targets strengthens taxonomic identification using sequence-based identification approaches.
TI  - Nisin-induced expression of a recombinant antihypertensive peptide in dairy lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To improve the process for the production of milk-derived antihypertensive peptides, including a 12-residue peptide (FFVAPFPECVGK) from alphaS1-casein. RESULTS: A synthetic gene encoding this peptide was cloned within the pediocin operon, replacing the nucleic acid sequence encoding the mature pediocin peptide (papA) and resulting in a translational fusion between the pediocin leader peptide and the 12-residue hypotensive (C-12) peptide. The recombinant operon was subsequently cloned immediately downstream of the nisA promoter to allow for inducible gene expression within Streptococcus thermophilus ST128, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ML3 and Lactobacillus casei C2. RT-PCR was used to confirm recombinant gene expression in complex medium; and SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the pediocin secretion machinery, encoded by papC and papD, allowed for secretion of the recombinant peptide from both L. lactis ML3 and L. casei C2 in a chemically defined medium. CONCLUSION: The use of a nisin as a "food-grade" inducer molecule, and generally-regarded-as-safe LAB species suggests that this system could be used for the production of functional food ingredients.
TI  - Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of synbiotic yogurt effect on  the health of children.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of daily consumption of a synbiotic yogurt drink on the health, growth, and quality of life of healthy children 12-48 months of age in out-of-home child care. STUDY DESIGN: Healthy children attending child care centers were enrolled in a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. The intervention was a yogurt drink containing Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, and Bifidobacterium animalis subspecies lactis (BB-12) (5 x 10(9) cfu/100 mL serving), and 1 g of inulin (synbiotic group) vs a similar nonsynbiotic-containing acidified milk drink (placebo group) once daily for 16 weeks. The end points were days of diarrhea, fever, vomiting, symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection, use of antibiotics, physician visits, child care absenteeism, parental work absenteeism, and quality of life (PedsQL 4.0; Mapi Research Trust, Lyon, France). RESULTS: Compared with placebo (n = 73), children receiving synbiotic (n = 76) had significantly fewer days of reported fever (1.85 vs 1.95, P < .05), significant improvement in social functioning (P < .035; pre-to-end intervention), and school functioning (P < .045; pre-to-mid intervention). More days with >/=3 loose/watery stools were reported in the synbiotic group (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Daily supplementation of children's diet with yogurt containing probiotic bacteria BB-12 and inulin significantly reduced days of fever and improved social and school functioning. The increased frequency of bowel movements may be explained by an accelerating effect of BB-12 and inulin on intestinal transit. Further research on the possible benefits of synbiotics on children's health is advised. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00653705.
TI  - Anoxic Conditions Promote Species-Specific Mutualism between Gut Microbes In Silico.
AB  - The human gut is inhabited by thousands of microbial species, most of which are still uncharacterized. Gut microbes have adapted to each other's presence as well as to the host and engage in complex cross feeding. Constraint-based modeling has been successfully applied to predicting microbe-microbe interactions, such as commensalism, mutualism, and competition. Here, we apply a constraint-based approach to model pairwise interactions between 11 representative gut microbes. Microbe-microbe interactions were computationally modeled in conjunction with human small intestinal enterocytes, and the microbe pairs were subjected to three diets with various levels of carbohydrate, fat, and protein in normoxic or anoxic environments. Each microbe engaged in species-specific commensal, parasitic, mutualistic, or competitive interactions. For instance, Streptococcus thermophilus efficiently outcompeted microbes with which it was paired, in agreement with the domination of streptococci in the small intestinal microbiota. Under anoxic conditions, the probiotic organism Lactobacillus plantarum displayed mutualistic behavior toward six other species, which, surprisingly, were almost entirely abolished under normoxic conditions. This finding suggests that the anoxic conditions in the large intestine drive mutualistic cross feeding, leading to the evolvement of an ecosystem more complex than that of the small intestinal microbiota. Moreover, we predict that the presence of the small intestinal enterocyte induces competition over host-derived nutrients. The presented framework can readily be expanded to a larger gut microbial community. This modeling approach will be of great value for subsequent studies aiming to predict conditions favoring desirable microbes or suppressing pathogens.
TI  - Proteolytic and ACE-inhibitory activities of probiotic yogurt containing non-viable bacteria as affected by different levels of fat, inulin and starter culture.
AB  - In this study, the effects of fat (0.5 %, 3.2 % and 5.0 %), inulin (0.0 and 1.0 %) and starter culture (0.0 %, 0.5 %, 1.0 % and 1.5 %) on the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity of probiotic yogurt containing non-viable bacteria were assessed. Proteolytic activities of bacteria were also investigated. Yogurts were prepared either using a sole yogurt commercial culture including Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subs. bulgaricus or bifidobacterium animalis BB-12 and Lactobacillus acidophilus La5 in addition to yogurt culture. Relative degrees of proteolysis were found to be considerably higher in yogurt samples than UHT milk as the control. Both regular and probiotic yogurts showed considerable ACE-inhibitory activities. Results showed that degree of proteolysis was not influenced by different fat contents, while was increased by high concentration of starter culture (1.5 % w/w) and reduced by inulin (1 % w/w). ACE-inhibitory activities of yogurt were also negatively affected by the presence of inulin and high levels of fat (5 % w/w). Moreover, yogurt containing probiotic bacteria showed higher inhibitory against ACE in comparison to the yogurt prepared with non-probiotic strains.
TI  - Targeted gene editing by transfection of in vitro reconstituted Streptococcus thermophilus Cas9 nuclease complex.

TI  - Biodiversity and gamma-aminobutyric acid production by lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional alpine raw cow's milk cheeses.
AB  - "Nostrano-cheeses" are traditional alpine cheeses made from raw cow's milk in Trentino-Alto Adige, Italy. This study identified lactic acid bacteria (LAB) developing during maturation of "Nostrano-cheeses" and evaluated their potential to produce gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an immunologically active compound and neurotransmitter. Cheese samples were collected on six cheese-making days, in three dairy factories located in different areas of Trentino and at different stages of cheese ripening (24 h, 15 days, and 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 months). A total of 1,059 LAB isolates were screened using Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA-PCR (RAPD-PCR) and differentiated into 583 clusters. LAB strains from dominant clusters (n = 97) were genetically identified to species level by partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. LAB species most frequently isolated were Lactobacillus paracasei, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides. The 97 dominant clusters were also characterized for their ability in producing GABA by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). About 71% of the dominant bacteria clusters evolving during cheeses ripening were able to produce GABA. Most GABA producers were Lactobacillus paracasei but other GABA producing species included Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Pediococcus pentosaceus, and Streptococcus thermophilus. No Enterococcus faecalis or Sc. macedonicus isolates produced GABA. The isolate producing the highest amount of GABA (80.0+/-2.7 mg/kg) was a Sc. thermophilus.
TI  - Evaluation of a Streptococcus thermophilus strain with innate anti-inflammatory properties as a vehicle for IL-10 cDNA delivery in an acute colitis model.
AB  - The aim of this work was to develop a Streptococcus (S.) thermophilus strain with improved anti-inflammatory properties due to the incorporation of the therapeutic cDNA delivery plasmid pValac::il-10. To achieve this purpose, cells of S. thermophilus CRL807, previously selected as being an important anti-inflammatory strain, were electroporated with pValac::il-10 plasmid. In order to confirm the functionality of the developed strain, it was co-cultured with human epithelial cells Caco-2 and the production of IL-10 was evaluated by ELISA. Bacterial suspensions of S. thermophilus CRL807 containing pValac::il-10 plasmid or of the wild-type (WT) strain were administered in vivo using a murine model of intestinal inflammation. The animals treated with S. thermophilus CRL807 pValac::il-10 showed a lower body weight loss, microbial translocation to liver and damage scores in their intestines at macroscopical and microscopic levels. Furthermore, a significant increase was observed in the concentration of IL-10 in the intestinal contents of these mice compared to the rest of the experimental groups, accompanied by decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The insertion of the therapeutic pValac::il-10 plasmid increased the intrinsic anti-inflammatory activity (synergetic effect) of S. thermophilus CRL807 which could be included in novel treatment protocols for inflammatory bowel diseases.
TI  - Assembling the Streptococcus thermophilus clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) array for multiplex DNA targeting.
AB  - In addition to the advantages of scalable, affordable, and easy to engineer, the  clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) technology is superior for multiplex targeting, which is laborious and inconvenient when achieved by cloning multiple gRNA expressing cassettes. Here, we report a simple CRISPR array assembling method which will facilitate multiplex targeting usage. First, the Streptococcus thermophilus CRISPR3/Cas locus was cloned. Second, different CRISPR arrays were assembled with different crRNA spacers. Transformation assays using different Escherichia coli strains demonstrated efficient plasmid DNA targeting, and we achieved targeting efficiency up to 95% with an assembled CRISPR array with three crRNA spacers.
TI  - Effects of Pleurotus eryngii polysaccharides on bacterial growth, texture properties, proteolytic capacity, and angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory activities of fermented milk.
AB  - Pleurotus eryngii is one of the most favored oyster mushrooms and contains various beneficial bioactive compounds. Polysaccharide extracted from P. eryngii (PEPS) was added as a natural-source ingredient to milk before fermentation, and the effects of additional PEPS on fermented milk were investigated in this study. The PEPS were extracted and added to reconstituted skim milk (12%, wt/vol) at 0.5, 0.25, and 0.125% (wt/vol) and fermented by a non-exopolysaccharide-producing strain, Streptococcus thermophilus Australian Starter Culture Collection (ASCC) 1303 (ST 1303), or an exopolysaccharide-producing Strep. thermophilus ASCC 1275 (ST 1275). Bacterial growth, texture properties, microstructure, proteolytic capacity, and angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory activities of fermented milk (FM) were determined during refrigerated storage at 4 degrees C for 21d. Viable counts of starter bacteria in FM with 0.5% PEPS added were the highest. Changes in pH were consistent with changes in titratable acidities for all samples. The FM samples with added PEPS showed denser protein aggregates containing larger serum pores in confocal micrographs compared with those without PEPS at d 0 and 21during refrigerated storage. The values for spontaneous whey separation of FM with added PEPS were significantly higher than those of FM fermented by ST 1303 or ST 1275 without PEPS. The proteolytic activities of ST 1303 of FM with added PEPS were higher than those of FM fermented by ST 1303 without PEPS. The FM with added 0.125% PEPS had similar angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory activity to that fermented by ST 1303 without PEPS; both were higher than those of other samples during refrigerated storage. Firmness and gumminess values of FM with added PEPS were higher than those of FM fermented by ST 1303 or ST 1275 without PEPS.
TI  - Excess of threonine compared with serine promotes threonine aldolase activity in  Lactococcus lactis IL1403.
AB  - Lactococcus lactis is an important lactic acid starter for food production as well as a cell factory for production of food grade additives, among which natural flavour production is one of the main interests of food producers. Flavour production is associated with the degradation of amino acids and comprehensive studies are required to elucidate mechanisms behind these pathways. In this study using chemically defined medium, labelled substrate and steady-state cultivation, new data for the catabolism of threonine in Lc. lactis have been obtained. The biosynthesis of glycine in this organism is associated with the catabolic pathways of glucose and serine. Nevertheless, if threonine concentration in the growth environment exceeds that of serine, threonine becomes the main source for glycine biosynthesis and the utilization of serine decreases. Also, the conversion of threonine to glycine was initiated by a threonine aldolase and this was the principal pathway used for threonine degradation. As in Streptococcus thermophilus, serine hydroxymethyltransferase in Lc. lactis may possess a secondary activity as threonine aldolase. Other catabolic pathways of threonine (e.g. threonine dehydrogenase and threonine dehydratase) were not detected.
TI  - Short communication: Evaluation of amino acid consumption and necessary profiles  of Streptococcus thermophilus T1C2 in controlled pH batch fermentations.
AB  - The objective of the present study was to elucidate the relationship between amino acid consumption and necessary profiles of Streptococcus thermophilus T1C2 to guide the design of media for high-cell-density culture. The amino acid consumption and necessary patterns of S. thermophilus T1C2 were investigated in the complete chemically defined medium. For amino acid consumption profiles throughout the growth of S. thermophilus T1C2, the most abundantly consumed amino acids were Gln and Arg, which accounted for 19 and 20% of total amino acids consumed, respectively. Asparagine, Thr, Ser, Ala, Val, Met, Leu, and Lys, consumptions of which ranged from 3 to 10% of total amino acids consumed, were the second most intensively consumed amino acids. For necessary amino acid patterns, the amount of Cys, which counted for 11% of total amino acids needed, was significantly higher than the amounts required for other amino acids in growth of S. thermophilus T1C2. The necessary amounts of Asp, Asn, Glu, Gln, Arg, Ala, Met, and Tyr ranked second, ranging from 5 to 8% of total amino acids needed. Compared with necessary amounts, the consumption of Asn, Thr, Ser, Gln, Arg, Ala, Val, Leu, Lys, His, and Phe exceeded the necessary amounts for growth of S. thermophilus T1C2 remarkably. Consumption of Gly, Met, Ile, Trp, and Pro was slightly higher than the necessary amounts. Consumption of Asp, Glu, Tyr, and Cys was lower than the necessary amounts. The overall consumption of amino acids exceeded the required amount for growth of S. thermophilus T1C2 almost 2.43 times, which implied a significant nitrogen wasting.
TI  - Microcalorimetric study of the growth of Streptococcus thermophilus in renneted milk.
AB  - The growth of Streptococcus thermophilus ST12 (ST12) in liquid milk, reconstituted from low-heat skim milk powder reconstituted skim milk (RSM) and in RSM with rennet addition (r-RSM) at 40 degrees C was monitored by microcalorimetry. It was shown that the growth rate of bacteria decreased in renneted samples in comparison with liquid RSM starting from certain sizes of the colonies ("deviation moments"), which depended on the inoculation rates. The hydrolysis of lactose was delayed for about 1 h in the r-RSM in comparison with RSM but otherwise the metabolism of carbohydrates in the renneted and non-renneted milks was similar. The total free amino acids (TFAA) content by the end of fermentations was higher in r-RSM than in RSM presumably due to the enzymatic hydrolytic activity of rennet. The quantitatively dominating amino acids were remarkably different in the r-RSM and RSM indicating that the hydrolysis cascade of caseins and/or metabolism of amino acids by the bacteria functioned differently in the two cases. The data obtained showed potential of microcalorimetry to characterize quantitative differences of growth and metabolism of the bacteria in renneted and liquid samples of milk.
TI  - Optimization of seabuckthorn fruit yogurt formulation using response surface methodology.
AB  - The response surface methodology was used to optimize the formulation of seabuckthorn fruit yogurt. The independent variables were proportions of seabuckthorn fruit syrup and skimmed milk powder. The responses were counts of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus, taste and viscosity of the product. Statistical analysis revealed that fruit syrup and skimmed milk powder significantly affected all the responses. Contour plots for each response were used to generate an optimum area by superimposition. Optimum formulation conditions of fruit syrup (15 %) and skimmed milk powder (12.5 %) are recommended for the blend formulation yielding an acceptable and good quality seabuckthorn fruit yogurt. Model validation was conducted using separate experiments at optimum conditions. The experimental values were found to be in close agreement to the predicted values and were within the acceptable limits indicating the suitability of the model in predicting quality attributes of seabuckthorn fruit yogurt. The resultant product also exhibited more amounts of fat, protein, carbohydrate and antioxidants viz., vitamin C, E, carotenoids, phenols and anthocyanins when compared to a commercial one.
TI  - Cas9 function and host genome sampling in Type II-A CRISPR-Cas adaptation.
AB  - To acquire the ability to recognize and destroy virus and plasmid invaders, prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas systems capture fragments of DNA within the host CRISPR locus. Our results indicate that the process of adaptation by a Type II-A CRISPR-Cas system in Streptococcus thermophilus requires Cas1, Cas2, and Csn2. Surprisingly, we found that Cas9, previously identified as the nuclease responsible for ultimate invader destruction, is also essential for adaptation. Cas9 nuclease activity is dispensable for adaptation. In addition, our studies revealed extensive, unbiased acquisition of the self-targeting host genome sequence by the CRISPR-Cas system that is masked in the presence of active target destruction.
TI  - Suicin 3908, a new lantibiotic produced by a strain of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 isolated from a healthy carrier pig.
AB  - While Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is known to cause severe infections in pigs,  it can also be isolated from the tonsils of healthy animals that do not develop infections. We hypothesized that S. suis strains in healthy carrier pigs may have the ability to produce bacteriocins, which may contribute to preventing infections by pathogenic S. suis strains. Two of ten S. suis serotype 2 strains isolated from healthy carrier pigs exhibited antibacterial activity against pathogenic S. suis isolates. The bacteriocin produced by S. suis 3908 was purified to homogeneity using a three-step procedure: ammonium sulfate precipitation, cationic exchange HPLC, and reversed-phase HPLC. The bacteriocin, called suicin 3908, had a low molecular mass; was resistant to heat, pH, and protease treatments; and possessed membrane permeabilization activity. Additive effects were obtained when suicin 3908 was used in combination with penicillin G or amoxicillin. The amino acid sequence of suicin 3908 suggested that it is lantibiotic-related and made it possible to identify a bacteriocin locus in the genome of S. suis D12. The putative gene cluster involved in suicin production by S. suis 3908 was amplified by PCR, and the sequence analysis revealed the presence of nine open reading frames (ORFs), including the structural gene and those required for the modification of amino acids, export, regulation, and immunity. Suicin 3908, which is encoded by the suiA gene, exhibited approximately 50% identity with bovicin HJ50 (Streptococcus bovis), thermophilin 1277 (Streptococcus thermophilus), and macedovicin (Streptococcus macedonicus). Given that S. suis 3908 cannot cause infections in animal models, that it is susceptible to conventional antibiotics, and that it produces a bacteriocin with antibacterial activity against all pathogenic S. suis strains tested, it could potentially be used to prevent infections and to reduce antibiotic use by the swine industry.
TI  - The effects of probiotics and prebiotics on the fatty acid profile and conjugated linoleic acid content of fermented cow milk.
AB  - The ability of probiotic bacteria (Lactobacillus acidophilus La5 and Bifidobacterium animalis Bb12), to produce conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) in association with Streptococcus thermophilus and Lb. bulgaricus during milk fermentation has been evaluated in this study. Pasteurized cow milk and infant formula were used. Infant formula was selected for its high linoleic acid content, for being a source of CLA and for its prebiotic compounds, e.g. galacto-oligosaccharides. The microorganisms were not able to increase the CLA content of the fermented products under the given experimental conditions. No statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) occurred between the CLA content in milk and the fermented samples. The CLA contents of 10 commercial fermented milk products were determined. The highest CLA content was observed in fermented milk containing only Str. thermophilus and Lb. bulgaricus.
TI  - Plant extract enhances the viability of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Lactobacillus acidophilus in probiotic nonfat yogurt.
AB  - A commercial plant extract (prepared from olive, garlic, onion and citrus extracts with sodium acetate (SA) as a carrier) was evaluated to extend the viability of yogurt starter and probiotic bacteria as a means to enhance the shelf life of live and active culture, probiotic nonfat yogurt. Yogurts prepared from three different formulas (0.5* plant extract, 0.25* SA, or no supplement) and cultures (yogurt starter plus Bifidobacterium animalis,Lactobacillus acidophilus, or both probiotics) were assessed weekly during 29 days of storage at 5 degrees C. Supplemented yogurt mixes had greater buffering capacities than non-supplemented yogurt mixes. At the end of storage, Lactobacillus bulgaricus and L. acidophilus counts in supplemented yogurts were greater compared with non-supplemented yogurts. Supplementation did not affect Streptococcus thermophilus and B. animalis counts. Hence the greater buffering capacity of yogurt containing plant extract could enhance the longevity of the probiotics, L. bulgaricus and L. acidophilus, during storage.
TI  - Physico-chemical properties and hypoglycaemic activity of fermented milks prepared with Anemarrhena asphodeloides water extracts.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In this research, water extract solutions of Anemarrhena asphodeloides (AA) rhizomes were added to reconstituted milk at 5%, 10% and 15% (v/v) to prepare AA fermented milk (AAFM5 , AAFM10 and AAFM15 ). The AAFM10 was selected for investigation of hypoglycaemic activity. RESULTS: Compared with the control fermented milk, titratable acidity values and water-holding capacities of AA fermented milk were increased to different extents, but syneresis values were reduced. The viable counts of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Bifidobacterium adolescentis were significantly increased, respectively. The blood sugar level of streptozotocin diabetic mice taking AAFM10 was reduced by 14.4%, and the food intake was decreased. The contents of malondialdehyde, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were reduced by different degrees, and insulin and total superoxide dismutase were significantly increased. CONCLUSION: AAFM10 had a significant hypoglycaemic effect and improvement in the complications (such as kidney disease and hyperlipemia) in the mouse model of diabetes.

TI  - An efficient method for multiple site-directed mutagenesis using type IIs restriction enzymes.
AB  - Site-directed mutagenesis (SDM) methods are very important in modern molecular biology, biochemistry, and protein engineering. Here, we present a novel SDM method that can be used for multiple mutation generation using type IIs restriction enzymes. This approach is faster and more convenient than the overlap polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method due to its having fewer reaction steps and being cheaper than, but as convenient as, enzymatic assembly. We illustrate the usefulness of our method by introducing three mutations into the bacterial Streptococcus thermophilus Cas9 (bStCas9) gene, converting the humanized S. thermophilus Cas9 (hStCas9) gene into nuclease dead or H847A nickase mutants and generating sunnyTALEN mutagenesis from a wild-type TALEN backbone.
TI  - Biophysical analysis of the molecular interactions between polysaccharides and mucin.
AB  - Mucoadhesive materials adhere persistently to mucosal surfaces. A mucoadhesive delivery system could therefore facilitate the controlled release of drugs and optimize their bioavailability in mucosal tissues. Polysaccharides are the most versatile class of natural polymers for transmucosal drug delivery. We used microviscosimetry to explore the mucoadhesion of a library of polysaccharide families with diverse structural characteristics as a first step toward the rational design of mucoadhesive polysaccharide-based nanoformulations. Here we show that the magnitude of deviation between the viscosity of mixed polysaccharide-mucin solutions and the corresponding individual stock solutions can indicate underlying molecular interactions. We found that nonlinear monotonic curves predicted a correlation between the magnitude of interaction and the ability of polysaccharide coils to contract in the presence of salt (i.e., chain flexibility). Charge-neutral polysaccharides such as dextran and Streptococcus thermophilus exopolysaccharide did not interact with mucin. Synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data supported the previously described structural features of mucin. Furthermore, high-q scattering data (i.e., sensitive to smaller scales) revealed that when mucin is in dilute solution (presumably in an extended conformation) in the presence of low-Mw alginate, its structure resembles that observed at higher concentrations in the absence of alginate. This effect was less pronounced in the case of high-Mw alginate, but the latter influenced the bulk properties of mucin-alginate mixtures (e.g., hydrodynamic radius and relative viscosity) more prominently than its low-Mw counterpart.
TI  - Whey protein isolate improves acid and bile tolerances of Streptococcus thermophilus ST-M5 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus LB-12.
AB  - Acid tolerance and bile tolerance are important probiotic characteristics. Whey proteins contain branched-chain amino acids, which play a role in muscle building and are popular among athletes. Increasing emphasis is being placed on diets containing less carbohydrate, less fat, and more protein. The effect of incremental additions of whey protein isolate (WPI) on probiotic characteristics of pure cultures is not known. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of added WPI on acid tolerance and bile tolerance of pure cultures of Streptococcus thermophilus ST-M5 and Lactobacillus bulgaricus LB-12. The WPI was used at 0 (control), 1, 2 and 3% (wt/vol). Assessment of acid tolerance was conducted on pure cultures at 30-min intervals for 2h of acid exposure and bile tolerance at 1-h intervals for 5h of bile exposure. Use of 1, 2, and 3% WPI improved acid tolerance of Strep. thermophilus ST-M5 and Lb. bulgaricus LB-12. The highest counts for acid tolerance of Strep. thermophilus ST-M5 and Lb. bulgaricus LB-12 were obtained when 3% WPI was used. Use of 2 and 3% WPI improved bile tolerance of Strep. thermophilus ST-M5 and Lb. bulgaricus LB-12 over 5h of bile exposure. The use of WPI is recommended to improve acid and bile tolerance of the yogurt culture bacteria Strep. thermophilus ST-M5 and Lb. bulgaricus LB-12.
TI  - The global regulator CodY in Streptococcus thermophilus controls the metabolic network for escalating growth in the milk environment.
AB  - CodY is a transcriptional regulator conserved in the low-GC group of Gram-positive bacteria. In this work, we demonstrated the presence in Streptococcus thermophilus ST2017 of a functional member of the CodY family of global regulatory proteins, S. thermophilus CodY (CodYSt). The CodYSt regulon was identified by transcriptome analysis; it consisted predominantly of genes involved in amino acid metabolism but also included genes involved in several other cellular processes, including carbon metabolism, nutrient transport, and stress response. It was revealed that CodYSt repressed the transformation of the central metabolic pathway to amino acid metabolism and improved lactose utilization. Furthermore, the glutamate dehydrogenase gene (gdhA), repressed by CodYSt, was suggested to coordinate the interconversion between carbon metabolism and amino acid metabolism and to play an important role on the optimal growth of S. thermophilus ST2017 in milk. A conserved CodYSt box [AA(T/A)(A/T)TTCTGA(A/C)AATT] was indeed required for in vitro binding of CodYSt to the target regions of DNA. These results provided evidence for the function of CodYSt, by which this strain coordinately regulates its various metabolic pathways so as to adapt to the milk environment.
TI  - Engineered L-serine hydroxymethyltransferase from Streptococcus thermophilus for  the synthesis of alpha,alpha-dialkyl-alpha-amino acids.
AB  - alpha,alpha-Disubstituted alpha-amino acids are central to biotechnological and biomedical chemical processes for their own sake and as substructures of biologically active molecules for diverse biomedical applications. Structurally, these compounds contain a quaternary stereocenter, which is particularly challenging for stereoselective synthesis. The pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent L-serine hydroxymethyltransferase from Streptococcus thermophilus (SHMT(Sth); EC 2.1.2.1) was engineered to achieve the stereoselective synthesis of a broad structural variety of alpha,alpha-dialkyl-alpha-amino acids. This was accomplished by the formation of quaternary stereocenters through aldol addition of the amino acids D-Ala and D-Ser to a wide acceptor scope catalyzed by the minimalist SHMT(Sth) Y55T variant overcoming the limitation of the native enzyme for Gly. The SHMT(Sth) Y55T variant tolerates aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes as well as hydroxy- and nitrogen-containing aldehydes as acceptors.
TI  - Diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Brazilian water buffalo mozzarella cheese.
AB  - The water buffalo mozzarella cheese is a typical Italian cheese which has been introduced in the thriving Brazilian market in the last 10 y, with good acceptance by its consumers. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) play an important role in the technological and sensory quality of mozzarella cheese. In this study, the aim was to evaluate the diversity of the autochthones viable LAB isolated from water buffalo mozzarella cheese under storage. Samples were collected in 3 independent trials in a dairy industry located in the southeast region of Brazil, on the 28th day of storage, at 4 masculineC. The LAB were characterized by Gram staining, catalase test, capacity to assimilate citrate, and production of CO2 from glucose. The diversity of LAB was evaluated by RAPD-PCR (randomly amplified polymorphic DNA-polymerase chain reaction), 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and by Vitek 2 system. Twenty LAB strains were isolated and clustered into 12 different clusters, and identified as Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and Lactobacillus helveticus. Enterococcus species were dominant and citrate-positive. Only the strains of L. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and L. fermentum produced CO2 from glucose and were citrate-positive, while L. casei was only citrate positive. This is the first report which elucidates the LAB diversity involved in Brazilian water buffalo mozzarella cheese. Furthermore, the results show that despite the absence of natural whey cultures as starters in production, the LAB species identified are the ones typically found in mozzarella cheese.
TI  - A sensitive assay for measuring aspartate-specific amino acid racemase activity.
AB  - d-Aspartate (d-Asp), a free d-amino acid found in mammals, plays crucial roles in the central nervous, neuroendocrine, and endocrine systems. In mammalian tissues, d-Asp oxidase (DDO) is a degradative enzyme that stereospecifically acts on d-Asp. Asp racemase, a synthetic enzyme that produces d-Asp from l-Asp, has been identified in several lower organisms; however, the biosynthetic pathway of d-Asp in mammals remains to be fully clarified. The aim of this study was to establish a simple, accurate, and sensitive enzymatic method for the determination of Asp racemase activity. Using recombinant Streptococcus thermophilus Asp racemase as a model enzyme, two enzymatic methods for the determination of Asp racemase activity were optimized. In these methods, recombinant human DDO was used to degrade d-Asp formed from l-Asp by the Asp racemase reaction to 2-oxo acid, the amounts of which were then determined using a colorimetric assay. In one method, designated the coupling method, DDO was concomitantly included in the Asp racemase reaction mixture, and the Asp racemase reaction was readily coupled to the d-Asp degradative reaction by DDO during the incubation. In the other method, designated the separating method, an aliquot of the Asp racemase reaction mixture was mixed with DDO after the reaction to determine the amounts of d-Asp produced by Asp racemase. Under optimized conditions, the accuracy and sensitivity of these two methods were examined and compared, both to one another and conventional high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results presented here suggest that the coupling method is more accurate and sensitive than the other two methods and can be used for the determination of Asp racemase activity. The coupling method may help to advance our current understanding of the biosynthetic pathway of d-Asp in mammals.
TI  - Sequences spanning the leader-repeat junction mediate CRISPR adaptation to phage  in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - CRISPR-Cas systems are RNA-based immune systems that protect prokaryotes from invaders such as phages and plasmids. In adaptation, the initial phase of the immune response, short foreign DNA fragments are captured and integrated into host CRISPR loci to provide heritable defense against encountered foreign nucleic acids. Each CRISPR contains a approximately 100-500 bp leader element that typically includes a transcription promoter, followed by an array of captured approximately 35 bp sequences (spacers) sandwiched between copies of an identical approximately 35 bp direct repeat sequence. New spacers are added immediately downstream of the leader. Here, we have analyzed adaptation to phage infection in Streptococcus thermophilus at the CRISPR1 locus to identify cis-acting elements essential for the process. We show that the leader and a single repeat of the CRISPR locus are sufficient for adaptation in this system. Moreover, we identified a leader sequence element capable of stimulating adaptation at a dormant repeat. We found that sequences within 10 bp of the site of integration, in both the leader and repeat of the CRISPR, are required for the process. Our results indicate that information at the CRISPR leader-repeat junction is critical for adaptation in this Type II-A system and likely other CRISPR-Cas systems.
TI  - Acquisition through horizontal gene transfer of plasmid pSMA198 by Streptococcus  macedonicus ACA-DC 198 points towards the dairy origin of the species.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus macedonicus is an intriguing streptococcal species whose most frequent source of isolation is fermented foods similarly to Streptococcus thermophilus. However, S. macedonicus is closely related to commensal opportunistic pathogens of the Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We analyzed the pSMA198 plasmid isolated from the dairy strain Streptococcus macedonicus ACA-DC 198 in order to provide novel clues about the main ecological niche of this bacterium. pSMA198 belongs to the narrow host range pCI305/pWV02 family found primarily in lactococci and to the best of our knowledge it is the first such plasmid to be reported in streptococci. Comparative analysis of the pSMA198 sequence revealed a high degree of similarity with plasmids isolated from Lactococcus lactis strains deriving from milk or its products. Phylogenetic analysis of the pSMA198 Rep showed that the vast majority of closely related proteins derive from lactococcal dairy isolates. Additionally, cloning of the pSMA198 ori in L. lactis revealed a 100% stability of replication over 100 generations. Both pSMA198 and the chromosome of S. macedonicus exhibit a high percentage of potential pseudogenes, indicating that they have co-evolved under the same gene decay processes. We identified chromosomal regions in S. macedonicus that may have originated from pSMA198, also supporting a long co-existence of the two replicons. pSMA198 was also found in divergent biotypes of S. macedonicus and in strains isolated from dispersed geographic locations (e.g. Greece and Switzerland) showing that pSMA198's acquisition is not a recent event. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Here we propose that S. macedonicus acquired plasmid pSMA198 from L. lactis via an ancestral genetic exchange event that took place most probably in milk or dairy products. We provide important evidence that point towards the dairy origin of this species.
TI  - Effect of adjuncts on microbiological and chemical properties of Scamorza cheese.
AB  - Scamorza is a semi-hard, pasta filata cheese resembling low-moisture Mozzarella cheese, with a short ripening time (<30d). Scamorza has a bland flavor and, to provide diversification from similar cheeses, it was manufactured using 2 types of milk in the current study: 100% Italian Friesian milk (F) or 90% F and 10% Jersey cow milk (mixed, M), and 2 types of starter: Streptococcus thermophilus or S. thermophilus with peptidolytic Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus helveticus, and Lactobacillus paracasei strains as adjuncts). The cheeses were ripened for 30d. The adjunct did not significantly affect acid production or growth of the primary starter; 2 of the species used in the adjunct (Lb. paracasei and Lb. helveticus) rapidly colonized the cheese and persisted until the end of ripening, whereas the counts of nonstarter lactic acid bacteria in the control cheese were low until the end of ripening. The use of adjuncts affected pH, microbial composition (as assessed by both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods), total free amino acid content, and volatile profile (measured using an electronic nose), whereas milk type had only a minor effect. Although differences in primary proteolysis were found, they were probably indirect and related to the effects on pH and moisture. We conclude that, even with a short ripening time (30d), use of a peptidolytic adjunct may significantly affect important features of Scamorza and may be used to create a product that is measurably different from competing products.
TI  - Quantitative analysis of the lactic acid and acetaldehyde produced by Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus strains isolated from traditional Turkish yogurts using HPLC.
AB  - The present study was conducted to evaluate the lactic acid- and acetaldehyde-producing abilities of lactic acid bacterial species isolated from traditionally manufactured Turkish yogurts using HPLC. The lactic acid bacterial species purified from the yogurts were the 2 most widely used species in industrial yogurt production: Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus. These bacteria have the ability to ferment hexose sugars homofermentatively to generate lactic acid and some carbonyl compounds, such as acetaldehyde through pyruvate metabolism. The levels of the compounds produced during fermentation influence the texture and the flavor of the yogurt and are themselves influenced by the chemical composition of the milk, processing conditions, and the metabolic activity of the starter culture. In the study, morphological, biochemical, and molecular characteristics were employed to identify the bacteria obtained from homemade yogurts produced in different regions of Turkey. A collection of 91 Strep. thermophilus and 35 L. bulgaricus strains were investigated for their lactic acid- and acetaldehyde-formation capabilities in various media such as cow milk, LM17 agar, and aerobic-anaerobic SM17 agar or de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe agar. The amounts of the metabolites generated by each strain in all conditions were quantified by HPLC. The levels were found to vary depending on the species, the strain, and the growth conditions used. Whereas lactic acid production ranged between 0 and 77.9 mg/kg for Strep. thermophilus strains, it ranged from 0 to 103.5 mg/kg for L. bulgaricus. Correspondingly, the ability to generate acetaldehyde ranged from 0 to 105.9 mg/kg in Strep. thermophilus and from 0 to 126.9 mg/kg in L. bulgaricus. Our study constitutes the first attempt to determine characteristics of the wild strains isolated from traditional Turkish yogurts, and the approach presented here, which reveals the differences in metabolite production abilities of the wild lactic acid bacteria strains, holds the potential for the selection of the most desirable strains to be used as starters in commercial yogurt manufacture in the future.
TI  - Effect of in situ exopolysaccharide production on physicochemical, rheological, sensory, and microstructural properties of the yogurt drink ayran: an optimization study based on fermentation kinetics.
AB  - Exopolysaccharide (EPS)-producing starter cultures are preferred for the manufacture of fermented milk products to improve rheological and technological properties. However, no clear correlation exists between EPS production and the rheological and technological properties of fermented milk products such as the yogurt drink ayran. In this study, 4 different strain conditions (EPS- and EPS+ Streptococcus thermophilus strains) were tested as a function of incubation temperature (32, 37, or 42 degrees C) and time (2, 3, or 4 h) to determine the effect of culture type and in situ EPS production on physicochemical, rheological, sensory, and microstructural properties of ayran. Furthermore, we assessed the effect of fermentation conditions on amounts of EPS production by different EPS-producing strains during ayran production. A multifactorial design of response surface methodology was used to model linear, interaction, and quadratic effects of these variables on steady shear rheological properties of ayran samples and in situ EPS production levels. The physicochemical and microbiological characteristics of ayran samples altered depending on incubation conditions and strain selection. Steady shear tests showed that ayran samples inoculated with EPS+ strains exhibited pseudoplastic flow behavior. Production of ayran with EPS- strain (control sample) resulted in the lowest apparent viscosity values (eta50), whereas those produced with the combination of 2 EPS+ strains yielded ayran with notably increased eta50 values. We concluded that incubation time was the variable with the greatest effect on eta50, consistency coefficient (K), and flow behavior index (n) values. In situ EPS production was also affected by these conditions during ayran fermentation in which strain-specific metabolism conditions were found to be the most important factor for EPS production. In addition, these findings correlated the amount of in situ EPS produced with the rheological properties of ayran. Scanning electron microscopy images of the samples showed differences in structural features, revealing a prominent network strand structure in the ayran samples inoculated with the admixture of 2 EPS-producing strains incubated at 37 degrees C for 3 h. These results provide useful information for large-scale production of ayran by the dairy industry.
TI  - Effect of a multispecies probiotic on inflammatory markers in critically ill patients: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Impairment of intestinal barrier function and increased translocation of bacteria to the systemic blood flow contribute to the emergence of sepsis. Probiotics might be of beneficial effects on critically ill-patients, modulating intestinal barrier function and reducing inflammation. The aim of this trial was to determine the effect of probiotics on inflammatory markers in critically ill-patients in Intensive Care Unit (ICU). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This trial was conducted on 40 critically ill-patients admitted to the ICU. Patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo or probiotic containing Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and Streptococcus thermophilus (VSL#3) for 7 days. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and systemic concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6), procalcitonin (PCT) and protein C were measured before initiation of the study and on days 4 and 7. RESULTS: A significant difference in IL-6 (P = 0.003), PCT (P = 0.014) and protein C (P < 0.001) levels, and also APACHE II and SOFA scores (P < 0.001) was seen over the treatment period between two groups. Moreover, there was a significant decrease in serum IL-6 levels (from 211.85 +/- 112.76 to 71.80 +/- 28.41) (P < 0.001) and PCT levels (from 1.67 +/- 1.27 to 0.47 +/- 0.41) (P < 0.001) and a significant increase in serum protein C levels (from 7.47 +/- 3.61 to 12.87 +/- 3.63) (P < 0.001) in probiotic group during the study. CONCLUSION: Probiotics could reduce inflammation in critically ill-patients and might be considered as an adjunctive therapy in the treatment of critically ill-patients.
TI  - Construction and validation of a mCherry protein vector for promoter analysis in  Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Lactobacilli are widespread in natural environments and are increasingly being investigated as potential health modulators. In this study, we have adapted the broad-host-range vector pNZ8048 to express the mCherry protein (pRCR) to expand the usage of the mCherry protein for analysis of gene expression in Lactobacillus. This vector is also able to replicate in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. The usage of pRCR as a promoter probe was validated in Lactobacillus acidophilus by characterizing the regulation of lactacin B expression. The results show that the regulation is exerted at the transcriptional level, with lbaB gene expression being specifically induced by co-culture of the L. acidophilus bacteriocin producer and the S. thermophilus STY-31 inducer bacterium.
TI  - Effect of carbon dioxide on sensory attributes, physico-chemical parameters and viability of Probiotic L. helveticus MTCC 5463 in fermented milk.
AB  - A carbonated probiotic fermented milk using India's first fully sequenced potential probiotic strain Lactobacillus helveticus MTCC 5463 in a combination with Streptococcus thermophilus MTCC 5460 was prepared and standardized with respect to carbon dioxide pressure, sugar and salt concentrations based on sensory, physico-chemical and microbial parameters. Final optimized product was prepared with 15 % sugar, 0.8 % salt concentration and carbonated at 15 kg cm(-2) pressure which was subsequently subjected to shelf life evaluation for 28 days at 5 +/- 1 degrees C. Even though a significant decrease was observed for overall acceptability, the product was acceptable on 28th day of storage. The titratable acidity, pH and tyrosine value has increased gradually while free fatty acids remained unchanged. The viable lactobaciili and streptococci count decreased from 7.84 to 7.54 and 8.94 to 8.87 log cfu mL(-1) during 28 days of storage, respectively.
TI  - The influence of the cell free solution of lactic acid bacteria on tyramine production by food borne-pathogens in tyrosine decarboxylase broth.
AB  - The function of cell-free solutions (CFSs) of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) on tyramine and other biogenic amine production by different food borne-pathogens (FBPs) was investigated in tyrosine decarboxylase broth (TDB) using HPLC. Cell free solutions were prepared from four LAB strains. Two different concentrations which were 50% (5 ml CFS+5 ml medium/1:1) and 25% (2.5 ml CFS+7.5 ml medium/1:3) CFS and the control without CFS were prepared. Both concentration of CFS of Streptococcus thermophilus and 50% CFS of Pediococcus acidophilus inhibited tyramine production up to 98% by Salmonella paratyphi A. Tyramine production by Escherichia coli was also inhibited by 50% CFS of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and 25% CFS of Leuconostoc lactis. subsp. cremoris. The inhibitor effect of 50% CFS of P. acidophilus was the highest on tyramine production (55%) by Listeria monocytogenes, following Lc. lactis subsp. lactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris (20%) whilst 25% CFS of Leu. mes. subsp. cremoris and Lc. lactis subsp. lactis showed stimulator effects (160%). The stimulation effects of 50% CFS of S. thermophilus and Lc. lactis subsp. lactis were more than 70% by Staphylococcus aureus comparing to the control. CFS of LAB strains showed statistically inhibitor effect since lactic acid inhibited microbial growth, decreased pH quickly and reduced the formation of AMN and BAs. Consequently, in order to avoid the formation of high concentrations of biogenic amines in fermented food by bacteria, it is advisable to use CFS for food and food products.
TI  - Effect of adjuncts on sensory properties and consumer liking of Scamorza cheese.
AB  - The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of a peptidolytic adjunct (Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus helveticus, and Lactobacillus paracasei), as a tool to accelerate ripening, on sensory properties and acceptability of Scamorza cheese obtained using 2 types of milk (Friesian and Friesian+Jersey) and Streptococcus thermophilus as primary starter. A 10-member panel was trained using a specific frame of references and used a specific vocabulary to assess cheese sensory properties through quantitative descriptive analysis (QDA), whereas 87 consumers were used to evaluate product acceptability. Analysis of variance showed that milk type did not markedly alter cheese sensory properties. Conversely, panelists perceived higher intensities of butter, saltiness, and sweetness flavors in cheese without adjunct culture (ST), whereas the addition of the adjunct culture (ST+A) induced higher and sourness flavors, oiliness and grainy textures, and lower adhesiveness, moisture, springiness, and tenderness. Principal component analysis showed positive relationships between pH and tenderness, sweetness and saltiness and a negative correlation between pH and grainy, oiliness, color and structure uniformity, sourness, and milk. Most of the differences observed in QDA and most of the relationships observed in the principal component analysis were linked to the higher microbial activity induced by the adjunct culture. Independently of milk and starter types, consumers perceived Scamorza cheese as characterized by a good eating quality (mean liking scores were all above the neutral point of the hedonic scale). Although ST cheeses showed higher values for overall liking, 2 homogeneous groups of consumers were identified using partial least squares regression analysis. One group preferred ST cheeses with higher levels of tenderness, adhesiveness, springiness, and moisture in terms of texture, butter in terms of flavor, and sweetness in terms of taste, whereas a second group preferred ST+A products characterized by specific attributes of texture (cohesiveness and oiliness), flavor (milk), taste (sourness), and appearance (structure and color uniformity). We conclude that further studies for the development of short-ripened products based on the use of adjunct cultures should be conducted to promote product differentiation and meet the sensory requirements of particular segments of consumers.
TI  - The probiotic VSL#3 has anti-inflammatory effects and could reduce endoscopic recurrence after surgery for Crohn's disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Probiotic formulations of single species of bacteria have not  been effective in preventing the recurrence of Crohn's disease after surgery. We investigated the ability of VSL#3, a mixture of 8 different bacterial probiotic species, to prevent Crohn's disease recurrence after surgery in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. METHODS: Within 30 days of ileocolonic resection and re-anastomosis, patients with Crohn's disease were randomly assigned to groups given 1 sachet of VSL#3 (900 billion viable bacteria, comprising 4 strains of Lactobacillus, 3 strains of Bifidobacterium, and 1 strain of Streptococcus salivarius subspecies thermophilus) (n = 59) or matching placebo (n = 60). Colonoscopy was performed at days 90 and 365 to evaluate the neoterminal ileum for disease recurrence and obtain mucosal biopsies for cytokine analysis. Patients from both groups with either no or mild endoscopic recurrence at day 90 received VSL#3 until day 365. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with severe endoscopic recurrence at day 90. RESULTS: At day 90, the proportion of patients with severe endoscopic lesions did not differ significantly between VSL#3 (9.3%) and placebo (15.7%, P = .19). The proportions of patients with non-severe lesions at day 90 who had severe endoscopic recurrence at day 365 were 10.0% in the early VSL#3 group (given VSL#3 for the entire 365 days) and 26.7% in the late VSL#3 group (given VSL#3 from days 90 through 365) (P = .09). Aggregate rates of severe recurrence (on days 90 and 365) were not statistically different, 20.5% of subjects in the early VSL#3 group and 42.1% in the late VSL#3 group. Patients receiving VSL#3 had reduced mucosal inflammatory cytokine levels compared with placebo at day 90 (P < .05). Crohn's disease activity index and inflammatory bowel disease quality of life scores were similar in the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: There were no statistical differences in endoscopic recurrence rates at day 90 between patients who received VSL#3 and patients who received placebo. Lower mucosal levels of inflammatory cytokines and a lower rate of recurrence among patients who received early VSL#3 (for the entire 365 days) indicate that this probiotic should be further investigated for prevention of Crohn's disease recurrence. Clinical trials.gov number: NCT00175292.
TI  - Programmable RNA shredding by the type III-A CRISPR-Cas system of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Immunity against viruses and plasmids provided by CRISPR-Cas systems relies on a  ribonucleoprotein effector complex that triggers the degradation of invasive nucleic acids (NA). Effector complexes of type I (Cascade) and II (Cas9-dual RNA) target foreign DNA. Intriguingly, the genetic evidence suggests that the type III-A Csm complex targets DNA, whereas biochemical data show that the type III-B Cmr complex cleaves RNA. Here we aimed to investigate NA specificity and mechanism of CRISPR interference for the Streptococcus thermophilus Csm (III-A) complex (StCsm). When expressed in Escherichia coli, two complexes of different stoichiometry copurified with 40 and 72 nt crRNA species, respectively. Both complexes targeted RNA and generated multiple cuts at 6 nt intervals. The Csm3 protein, present in multiple copies in both Csm complexes, acts as endoribonuclease. In the heterologous E. coli host, StCsm restricts MS2 RNA phage in a Csm3 nuclease-dependent manner. Thus, our results demonstrate that the type III-A StCsm complex guided by crRNA targets RNA and not DNA.
TI  - New supramolecular metallo-terpyridine carboxymethyl cellulose derivatives with antimicrobial properties.
AB  - Preparation of a new water-soluble, cellulose derivative via a supramolecular route is presented. In a one-step procedure, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) was reacted with the Cu(BF4)2 complex of 4'-chloro[2,2':6',2'']terpyridine to generate the desired CMC-Cu(II)-terpyridine derivative. This polymeric salt was characterized by elemental analysis, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-visible), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), rheological properties measurements, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA), and tensile strength properties testing. In addition, antimicrobial properties were demonstrated against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus thermophilus), Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli), and yeast (Saccharomyces cervisiae). The minimum inhibitory concentration of the prepared metallo-terpyridine CMC derivative against the studied microorganisms ranged from 6 to 8 mg/L to achieve >/=90% of microbial growth inhibition.
TI  - Thermodynamic evidence for a dual transport mechanism in a POT peptide transporter.
AB  - Peptide transport plays an important role in cellular homeostasis as a key route  for nitrogen acquisition in mammalian cells. PepT1 and PepT2, the mammalian proton coupled peptide transporters (POTs), function to assimilate and retain diet-derived peptides and play important roles in drug pharmacokinetics. A key characteristic of the POT family is the mechanism of peptide selectivity, with members able to recognise and transport >8000 different peptides. In this study, we present thermodynamic evidence that in the bacterial POT family transporter PepTSt, from Streptococcus thermophilus, at least two alternative transport mechanisms operate to move peptides into the cell. Whilst tri-peptides are transported with a proton:peptide stoichiometry of 3:1, di-peptides are co-transported with either 4 or 5 protons. This is the first thermodynamic study of proton:peptide stoichiometry in the POT family and reveals that secondary active transporters can evolve different coupling mechanisms to accommodate and transport chemically and physically diverse ligands across the membrane.
TI  - Molecular characterization of Lactobacillus plantarum DMDL 9010, a strain with efficient nitrite degradation capacity.
AB  - Nitrites commonly found in food, especially in fermented vegetables, are potential carcinogens. Therefore, limiting nitrites in food is critically important for food safety. A Lactobacillus strain (Lactobacillus sp. DMDL 9010) was previously isolated from fermented vegetables by our group, and is not yet fully characterized. A number of phenotypical and genotypical approaches were employed to characterize Lactobacillus sp. DMDL 9010. Its nitrite degradation capacity was compared with four other Lactobacillus strains, including Lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus 719, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricu 1.83, Streptococcus thermophilus 1.204, and lactobacillus plantarum 8140, on MRS medium. Compared to these four Lactobacillus strains, Lactobacillus sp. DMDL 9010 had a significantly higher nitrite degradation capacity (P<0.001). Based on 16S rDNA sequencing and sequence comparison, Lactobacillus sp. DMDL 9010 was identified as either Lactobacillus plantarum or Lactobacillus pentosus. To further identify this strain, the flanking regions (922 bp and 806 bp upstream and downstream, respectively) of the L-lactate dehydrogenase 1 (L-ldh1) gene were amplified and sequenced. Lactobacillus sp. DMDL 9010 had 98.92 and 76.98% sequence identity in the upstream region with L. plantarum WCFS1 and L. pentosus IG1, respectively, suggesting that Lactobacillu sp. DMDL 9010 is an L. plantarum strain. It was therefore named L. plantarum DMDL 9010. Our study provides a platform for genetic engineering of L. plantarum DMDL 9010, in order to further improve its nitrite degradation capacity.
TI  - Immunoreactivity of lactic acid-treated mare's milk after simulated digestion.
AB  - The similarity of mare's milk to breast milk makes it an interesting substrate for the creation of dairy beverages. The aim of this study was to determine the immunoreactivity of the digested mare's milk products carried out by lactic acid fermentation with Lactobacillus casei LCY, Streptococcus thermophilus MK10 and Bifidobacterium animalis Bi30. Simulation of digestion with saliva, pepsin and pancreatin/bile salts was carried out. The immunoreactivity of the milk proteins was assessed by competitive ELISA. The separation of proteins was studied using a tricine SDS-PAGE method. It has been demonstrated that lactic acid fermentation significantly decreases the immunoreactivity of beta-lactoglobulin, beta-casein, kappa-casein and bovine serum albumin. The level of reduction was connected to the type of bacterial strain. The simulated digestion processes caused the decline of immunoreactivity, and the decreases obtained in the experiment were as follows: lactoferrin: 95%, beta-lactoglobulin: 94%, beta-casein: 93%, alpha-lactalbumin: 82%, alpha-casein: 82%, bovine serum albumin: 76% and kappa-casein: 37%. The results of the study indicated that microbial fermentation with tested strains is a valuable method for reducing the immunoreactivity of mare's milk proteins. However, further studies with other bacterial strains are needed to gain a higher level of elimination or total reduction of mare's milk immunoreactivity to possibly introduce fermented mare's milk into the diet of patients with immune-mediated digestive problems.
TI  - Effects of lactic acid bacteria on low-density lipoprotein susceptibility to oxidation and aortic fatty lesion formation in hyperlipidemic hamsters.
AB  - We investigated the effects of Streptococcus thermophilus YIT 2001, a strain of lactic acid bacteria, on the susceptibility of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) to oxidation and the formation of aortic fatty lesions in hyperlipidemic hamsters. S. thermophilus YIT 2001 had the highest in vitro antioxidative activity against LDL oxidation among the 79 strains of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria tested, which was about twice that of S. thermophilus YIT 2084. The lag time of LDL oxidation in the YIT 2001 feeding group was significantly longer than in controls, but was unchanged in the YIT 2084 group. After the feeding of YIT 2001, lag times were prolonged and areas of aortic fatty lesions were dose-dependently attenuated, although there were no effects on plasma lipid levels. These results suggest that YIT 2001 has the potential to prevent the formation of aortic fatty lesions by inhibiting LDL oxidation.
TI  - Use of probiotics to reduce faecal shedding of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia  coli in sheep.
AB  - Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) are zoonotic, foodborne pathogens of humans. Ruminants, including sheep, are the primary reservoirs of STEC and there is a need to develop intervention strategies to reduce the entry of STEC into the food chain. The initiation of the majority of bacterial, enteric infections involves colonisation of the gut mucosal surface by the pathogen. However, probiotic bacteria can serve to decrease the severity of infection via a number of mechanisms including competition for receptors and nutrients, and/or the synthesis of organic acids and bacteriocins that create an environment unfavourable for pathogen development. The aim of the current study was to determine whether the administration of a probiotic mixture to sheep experimentally infected with a non-O157 STEC strain, carrying stx1, stx2 and eae genes, was able to decrease faecal shedding of the pathogen. The probiotic mixture contained Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus and Enterococcus faecium. The numbers of non-O157 STEC in faecal samples collected from sheep receiving daily doses of the probiotic mixture were significantly lower at the 3rd, 5th and 6th week post-inoculation when compared to the levels recorded in untreated animals. It was concluded that administration of the probiotic mixture reduced faecal shedding of non-O157 STEC in sheep, and holds potential as a pre-harvest intervention method to reduce transmission to humans.
TI  - Local Probiotic Therapy for Vaginal Candida albicans Infections.
AB  - The high rate of vaginal Candida albicans recurrence is attributed to azole resistance rates as high as 15 %. The aim of this study was to determine the clinical and microbiological efficacy of standard azole therapy for treatment of vaginal C. albicans infection alone and in combination with local probiotic as well as the effects on vaginal microbiota. This study included 436 women with vaginal candidiasis randomly assigned to two treatment groups. The first group, with 207 patients (12 dropouts), was administered 150 mg fluconazole and a single vaginal globule of fenticonazole (600 mg) on the same day. The second group of 209 patients (8 dropouts) followed the same treatment schedule; however, ten applications of a vaginal probiotic containing Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. rhamnosus, Streptococcus thermophilus, and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus were also administered beginning the fifth day after azole treatment. Microbiological analysis of the therapy efficacy in the first treatment group showed C. albicans resistance in over 30 % of patients. Clinical complaints persisted after treatment administration in 79.7 % (n = 165) of women in this group. Clinical complaints in the second group decreased to 31.1 % (n = 65) and microbiological efficacy also improved among investigated parameters, from 93.7 % (n = 193) to 95.2 % (n = 198). The local application of probiotics after administration of combined azoles for treatment of vaginal C. albicans infections increases therapy efficacy and could prevent relapse.
TI  - Anti-wrinkle effects of fermented and non-fermented Cyclopia intermedia in hairless mice.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The fermented leaves and stems of Cyclopia intermedia are used to brew honeybush tea, an herbal tea indigenous to South Africa with reported anti-wrinkle effects. Wrinkle formation caused by photoaging clearly involves changes in extracellular matrix components and mechanical properties of the skin. METHODS: The inhibitory effects of honeybush extract and fermented honeybush on wrinkle formation were determined by analyzing skin replicas, histologically examining epidermal thickness, and identifying damage to collagen fibers. RESULTS: Honeybush extract and fermented honeybush reduced the length and depth of skin winkles caused by UV irradiation and inhibited thickening of the epidermal layer, in addition to suppressing collagen tissue breakdown reactions, indicating its potential use as a skin wrinkle prevention agent. CONCLUSIONS: This in vivo study demonstrates that honeybush produces significant anti-wrinkle effects and is therefore of interest in anti-aging skin care products.
TI  - Probiotics for preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is common in intensive care units (ICUs). Some evidence indicates that probiotics may reduce the incidence of VAP. Several additional published studies have demonstrated that probiotics are safe and efficacious in preventing VAP in ICUs. We aimed to systematically summarise the results of all available data to generate the best evidence for the prevention of VAP. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of probiotics for preventing VAP. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 8), MEDLINE (1948 to September week 1, 2014) and EMBASE (2010 to September 2014). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing probiotics with placebo or another control (excluding RCTs that use probiotics in both study groups) to prevent VAP. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed eligibility and the quality of trials, and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: We included eight RCTs, with 1083 participants. All studies compared a form of probiotic (Lactobacillus casei rhamnosus; Lactobacillus plantarum; Synbiotic 2000FORTE; Ergyphilus; combination Bifidobacterium longum + Lactobacillus bulgaricus + Streptococcus thermophilus) versus a control group (placebo; glutamine; fermentable fibre; peptide; chlorhexidine). The analysis of all RCTs showed that the use of probiotics decreased the incidence of VAP (odds ratio (OR) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52 to 0.95, low quality evidence). However, the aggregated results were uncertain for ICU mortality (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.22 very low quality evidence), in-hospital mortality (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.14, very low quality evidence), incidence of diarrhoea (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.09, very low quality evidence), length of ICU stay (mean difference (MD) -1.60, 95% CI -6.53 to 3.33, very low quality evidence), duration of mechanical ventilation (MD -6.15, 95% CI -18.77 to 6.47, very low quality evidence) and antibiotic use (OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.96, low quality evidence). Antibiotics for VAP were used for a shorter duration (in days) when participants received probiotics in one small study (MD -3.00, 95% CI -6.04 to 0.04). However, the CI of the estimated effect was too wide to exclude no difference with probiotics. There were no reported events of nosocomial probiotic infections in any included study.The overall methodological quality of the included studies, based on our 'Risk of bias' assessments, was moderate with half of the included studies rated as a 'low' risk of bias; however, we rated four included studies as a 'high' risk of bias across one or more of the domains. The study limitations, differences in probiotics administered and participants, and small sample sizes across the included studies mean that the power to detect a trend of overall effect may be limited and chance findings cannot be excluded.To explore the influence of some potential confounding factors in the studies, we conducted an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, which did not change the inference of per-protocol analysis. However, our sensitivity analysis did not indicate a significant difference between groups for instances of VAP. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Evidence suggests that use of probiotics is associated with a reduction in the incidence of VAP. However, the quality of the evidence is low and the exclusion of the one study that did not provide a robust definition of VAP increased the uncertainty in this finding. The available evidence is not clear regarding a decrease in ICU or hospital mortality with probiotic use. Three trials reported on the incidence of diarrhoea and the pooled results indicate no clear evidence of a difference. The results of this meta-analysis do not provide sufficient evidence to draw conclusions on the efficacy and safety of probiotics for the prevention of VAP in ICU patients.
TI  - Genomics of Streptococcus salivarius, a major human commensal.
AB  - The salivarius group of streptococci is of particular importance for humans. This group consists of three genetically similar species, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus vestibularis and Streptococcus thermophilus. S. salivarius and S. vestibularis are commensal organisms that may occasionally cause opportunistic infections in humans, whereas S. thermophilus is a food bacterium widely used in dairy production. We developed Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and comparative genomic analysis to confirm the clear separation of these three species. These analyses also identified a subgroup of four strains, with a core genome diverging by about 10%, in terms of its nucleotide sequence, from that of S. salivarius sensu stricto. S. thermophilus species displays a low level of nucleotide variability, due to its recent emergence with the development of agriculture. By contrast, nucleotide variability is high in the other two species of the salivarius group, reflecting their long-standing association with humans. The species of the salivarius group have genome sizes ranging from the smallest ( approximately 1.7Mb for S. thermophilus) to the largest ( approximately 2.3Mb for S. salivarius) among streptococci, reflecting genome reduction linked to a narrow, nutritionally rich environment for S. thermophilus, and natural, more competitive niches for the other two species. Analyses of genomic content have indicated that the core genes of S. salivarius account for about two thirds of the genome, indicating considerable variability of gene content and differences in potential adaptive features. Furthermore, we showed that the genome of this species is exceptionally rich in genes encoding surface factors, glycosyltransferases and response regulators. Evidence of widespread genetic exchanges was obtained, probably involving a natural competence system and the presence of diverse mobile elements. However, although the S. salivarius strains studied were isolated from several human body-related sites (all levels of the digestive tract, skin, breast milk, and body fluids) and included clinical strains, no genetic or genomic niche-specific features could be identified to discriminate specific group.
TI  - Natamycin content and quality evaluation of yoghurt from small- and large-scale brands in Turkey.
AB  - In this study, the presence of natamycin and quality parameters of yoghurt samples manufactured by small- and large-scale dairy firms in Turkey were investigated. Physicochemical and microbiological results revealed that, except Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus counts, the majority of the yoghurts manufactured by small-scale dairy firms were found to be out of the limits. Natamycin was detected in 31 and 2 yoghurt samples from small- and large-scale brands, respectively. The levels of natamycin in small-scale brand yoghurts were higher than those in large-scale brand yoghurts. Of the analysed samples, 42.3% did not comply with the Turkish Food Codex.
TI  - Effectiveness of an association of a cranberry dry extract, D-mannose, and the two microorganisms Lactobacillus plantarum LP01 and Lactobacillus paracasei LPC09 in women affected by cystitis: a pilot study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common bacterial infection in women. Most UTIs are acute uncomplicated cystitis caused by Escherichia coli (86%). This study was undertaken to assess the effectiveness of an association of a cranberry dry extract, D-mannose, a gelling complex composed of the exopolysaccharides produced by Streptococcus thermophilus ST10 (DSM 25246) and tara gum, as well as the 2 microorganisms Lactobacillus plantarum LP01 (LMG P-21021) and Lactobacillus paracasei LPC09 (DSM 24243) in women affected by acute uncomplicated cystitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-three premenopausal, nonpregnant women diagnosed with acute uncomplicated cystitis were enrolled in a pilot prospective study and completed the treatment protocol. Subjects were instructed to take 2 doses per day during the first month, and then to continue with 1 sachet per day until the sixtieth day. Nitrites and leukocyte esterase on urine dipstick testing were used as indicators of cystitis, with analysis performed at enrollment, after 30 and 60 days, and after 1 month of follow-up. Typical UTI symptoms, namely dysuria, frequent voiding of small volumes, urinary urgency, suprapubic pain, and gross hematuria were scored 0 to 3 and evaluated at each visit. RESULTS: Positive results for the presence of nitrites and leukocyte esterase were found in 14 and 20 subjects after 30 days and in 9 and 14 women after 60 days, respectively (P<0.001). At the end of the follow-up period, positive results for nitrites and leukocyte esterase were recorded in only 4 and 3 of 24 and 19 subjects (16.7%, P=0.103; 15.8%, P=0.325, respectively), with negative results after 60 days. Typical symptoms of cystitis, specifically dysuria, frequent voiding, urgency, and suprapubic pain were significantly improved as well. No significant differences were recorded in the incidence and severity of hematuria at any visit. CONCLUSION: The long-term ability of an association of cranberry, D-mannose, an innovative gelling complex, and the 2 microorganisms tested to significantly improve the uncomfortable symptoms reported by women with acute cystitis has been suggested.
TI  - Assessment of the capability of a gelling complex made of tara gum and the exopolysaccharides produced by the microorganism Streptococcus thermophilus ST10 to prospectively restore the gut physiological barrier: a pilot study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Leaky gut, or intestinal permeability, is the phenomenon of the gut wall exhibiting increased absorbency. It is pretty well recognised that an altered or damaged bowel lining or gut wall may result from unbalanced diet, parasites, infection, or medications and that this allows substances such as toxins, microbes, undigested food, or waste to leak through. As a natural consequence, this prompts the body to initiate an immune reaction leading to potentially severe health conditions. Different strategies may be used to improve, at least temporarily, the physiological intestinal barrier. The use of specific beneficial microorganisms, such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, has been suggested as an innovative tool to counteract an improper level of intestinal permeability. The association of bacteria with specific gelling agents, such as gums, may represent an improvement since these molecules are able to form hydrophilic gels that distribute uniformly over the inner intestinal surface. This pilot study was undertaken to evaluate intestinal permeability in subjects treated with a gelling complex, an association of tara gum and the microorganism Streptococcus thermophilus ST10 (DSM 25246), which has a well-demonstrated in vitro ability to synthesise and secrete exopolysaccharides (EPSs). METHODS: Twenty-five healthy subjects were enrolled in this human intervention, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot trial (age between 21 and 57 y, mean 37.7+/-11.2). Subjects were then randomised into 2 groups: group A (13 subjects) was given an active formulation containing 250 mg of tara gum and 1 billion viable cells of S. thermophilus ST10, whereas group B (12 subjects) was given a placebo formulation. All the subjects participating in the study were directed to take 1 dose per day for 30 consecutive days. The presence and concentration of exopolysaccharides (EPSs) in the faeces was determined at time 0 (d0), after 30 days of treatment (d30), and at the end of the 2-week follow-up period (d45). The monosaccharide composition of EPSs was used to quantify the possible contribution of tara gum to the amount of polysaccharides detected in the faecal material. Intestinal permeability was evaluated at the same time by means of the lactitol/mannitol ratio (small intestine permeability) and sucralose concentration (colonic permeability) in urine specimens sampled after specified times. A statistical comparison was made between the concentration of EPSs, the lactulose/mannitol ratio, and the amount of excreted sucralose in the 2 groups at d0, d30, and d45. RESULTS: In the active group, supplementation with S. thermophilus ST10 and tara gum was able to significantly increase the faecal EPSs concentration compared with placebo (from 0.169 mg/g to 0.633 mg/g after 30 d, P<0.001). An interesting decrease in intestinal permeability, both of the small bowel and in the colon, was also recorded. The L/M ratio diminished from 0.021 in the active group to 0.014 and 0.015 after 30 and 45 days, respectively (P=0.045 and P=0.033 compared with placebo). The sucralose concentration decreased from 35.8 mg to 27.9 mg and 29.1 mg (P=0.038 and P=0.026 compared with placebo) at the end of the supplementation period and after the follow-up, respectively. No significant differences were recorded in the placebo after 30 days or at the end of the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The association of the EPSs produced by S. thermophilus ST10 and tara gum seems capable of significantly improving the intestinal functional barrier in healthy subjects. A wider study in subjects presenting impaired gut permeability would be useful in the future to confirm the positive results from this pilot trial. In any case, our findings are consistent with the parallel increase in exopolysaccharide concentration in the faecal material, thus suggesting the effective ability of the strain used to secrete EPSs in the gut lumen. An innovative approach of this type may be useful in helping to restore the physiological barrier by means of a merely natural and mechanical action.
TI  - Treatment of atopic dermatitis eczema with a high concentration of Lactobacillus  salivarius LS01 associated with an innovative gelling complex: a pilot study on adults.
AB  - GOALS: To evaluate the efficacy of a highly concentrated Lactobacillus salivarius preparation containing a gelling complex formed by Streptococcus thermophilus ST10 and tara gum in the treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD). BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated an improvement in AD symptoms after administration of the probiotic strain L. salivarius LS01. S. thermophilus ST10 and tara gum create a gelling complex that adheres to intestinal mucus and improves barrier function. STUDY: A prospective, controlled pilot trial was carried out to evaluate how the association of S. thermophilus ST10 and tara gum could improve the activity of L. salivarius LS01 administered at high doses to adults with AD. Twenty-five patients were included into the study: 13 were treated for 1 month with the active formulation, whereas 12 represented the placebo group. Scoring Atopic Dermatitis index was determined before and at the end of probiotic administration. Fecal samples were also collected to evaluate changes in bacterial counts of Staphylococcus aureus and clostridia. RESULTS: A significant improvement in SCORAD index was observed in the probiotic group after 1 month of treatment, whereas no significant changes occurred in placebo patients. A slight decrease in fecal S. aureus count was observed in probiotic-treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Data obtained in this study suggest a potential role for L. salivarius LS01 in the treatment of AD. The addition of tara gum and S. thermophilus ST10 seems to improve the overall efficacy of the probiotic strain, in particular shortening the time required for the onset of the positive effects. Further studies to investigate the activity of this preparation are advisable.
TI  - Short-term probiotic therapy alleviates small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, but does not improve intestinal permeability in chronic liver disease.
AB  - AIM: : Although numerous animal studies suggest that probiotic therapy has beneficial effects in various liver diseases, the evidence for beneficial effects in human liver disease is controversial. This study was carried out to investigate the efficacy of probiotic therapy in alleviating small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and permeability in chronic liver disease. METHODS: Fifty-three patients with chronic liver disease were randomized to either probiotic therapy or placebo. Six bacterial species were used: Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium lactis, Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Streptococcus thermophilus. After 4 weeks, changes in the composition of fecal bacteria, SIBO, intestinal permeability, and clinical symptoms were examined. RESULTS: Three of the six probiotic species, B. lactis, L. rhamnosus, and L. acidophilus, increased in the feces of the probiotic therapy group (P<0.001), whereas there was no change in fecal microbiota in the placebo group. SIBO disappeared in many individuals of the probiotic therapy group, but none in the placebo (24 vs. 0%, P<0.05). General gastrointestinal symptoms also improved more in the probiotic group and improvement in intestinal permeability was slightly but not significantly more frequent in the probiotic arm than the placebo arm (50 vs. 31.3%, P=0.248). Numbers of lactobacilli in stool were correlated negatively with intestinal permeability (P for trend<0.05). Liver chemistry did not improve significantly in either group. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that short-term probiotic administration in chronic liver disease is effective in alleviating SIBO and clinical symptoms, but ineffective in improving intestinal permeability and liver function.
TI  - Functional screening of antibiotic resistance genes from a representative metagenomic library of food fermenting microbiota.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) represent the predominant microbiota in fermented foods. Foodborne LAB have received increasing attention as potential reservoir of antibiotic resistance (AR) determinants, which may be horizontally transferred to opportunistic pathogens. We have previously reported isolation of AR LAB from the raw ingredients of a fermented cheese, while AR genes could be detected in the final, marketed product only by PCR amplification, thus pointing at the need for more sensitive microbial isolation techniques. We turned therefore to construction of a metagenomic library containing microbial DNA extracted directly from the food matrix. To maximize yield and purity and to ensure that genomic complexity of the library was representative of the original bacterial population, we defined a suitable protocol for total DNA extraction from cheese which can also be applied to other lipid-rich foods. Functional library screening on different antibiotics allowed recovery of ampicillin and kanamycin resistant clones originating from Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus helveticus genomes. We report molecular characterization of the cloned inserts, which were fully sequenced and shown to confer AR phenotype to recipient bacteria. We also show that metagenomics can be applied to food microbiota to identify underrepresented species carrying specific genes of interest.
TI  - Applicability of a Lactobacillus amylovorus strain as co-culture for natural folate bio-enrichment of fermented milk.
AB  - The ability of 55 strains from different Lactobacillus species to produce folate  was investigated. In order to evaluate folic acid productivity, lactobacilli were cultivated in the folate-free culture medium (FACM). Most of the tested strains needed folate for growth. The production and the extent of vitamin accumulation were distinctive features of individual strains. Lactobacillus amylovorus CRL887 was selected for further studies because of its ability to produce significantly higher concentrations of vitamin (81.2 +/- 5.4 mug/L). The safety of this newly identified folate producing strain was evaluated through healthy experimental mice. No bacterial translocation was detected in liver and spleen after consumption of CRL887 during 7 days and no undesirable side effects were observed in the animals that received this strain. This strain in co-culture with previously selected folate producing starter cultures (Lactobacillus bulgaricus CRL871, and Streptococcus thermophilus CRL803 and CRL415) yielded a yogurt containing high folate concentrations (263.1 +/- 2.4 mug/L); a single portion of which would provide 15% of the recommended dietary allowance. This is the first report where a Lactobacillus amylovorus strain was successfully used as co-culture for natural folate bio-enrichment of fermented milk.
TI  - Experimental study on the optimization of general conditions for a free-flow electrophoresis device with a thermoelectric cooler.
AB  - With a given free-flow electrophoresis device, reasonable conditions (electric field strength, carrier buffer conductivity, and flow rate) are crucial for an optimized separation. However, there has been no experimental study on how to choose reasonable general conditions for a free-flow electrophoresis device with a thermoelectric cooler in view of Joule heat generation. Herein, comparative experiments were carried out to propose the selection procedure of general conditions in this study. The experimental results demonstrated that appropriate conditions were (i) <67 V/cm electric field strength; (ii) lower than 1.3 mS/cm carrier buffer conductivity (Tris-HCl: 20 mM Tris was titrated by HCl to pH 8.0); and (iii) higher than 3.6 mL/min carrier buffer flow rate. Furthermore, under inappropriate conditions (e.g. 400 V voltage and 40 mM Tris-HCl carrier buffer), the free-flow electrophoresis separation would be destroyed by bubbles caused by more Joule heating. Additionally, a series of applications under the appropriate conditions were performed with samples of model dyes, proteins (bovine serum albumin, myoglobin, and cytochrome c), and cells (Escherichia coli, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The separation results showed that under the appropriate conditions, separation efficiency was obviously better than that in the previous experiments with randomly or empirically selected conditions.
TI  - Preparation of low galactose yogurt using cultures of Gal(+) Streptococcus thermophilus in combination with Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus is an important lactic starter used in the production  of yogurt. Most strains of S. thermophilus are galactose negative (Gal(-)) and are able to metabolize only glucose portion of lactose and expel galactose into the medium. This metabolic defect leads to the accumulation of free galactose in yogurt, resulting in galactosemia among consumers. Hence there is an absolute need to develop low galactose yogurt. Therefore, in this study, three galactose positive (Gal(+)) S. thermophilus strains from National Collection of Dairy Cultures (NCDC) viz. NCDC 659 (AJM), NCDC 660 (JM1), NCDC 661 (KM3) and a reference galactose negative (Gal(-)) S. thermophilus NCDC 218 were used for preparation of low galactose yogurt. In milk fermented using S. thermophilus isolates alone, NCDC 659 released less galactose (0.27 %) followed by NCDC 661 (0.3 %) and NCDC 660 (0.45 %) after 10 h at 42 degrees C. Milk was fermented in combination with Gal(-) L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus NCDC 04, in which NCDC 659 released least galactose upto 0.49 % followed by NCDC 661 (0.51 %) and NCDC 660 (0.60 %) than reference Gal(-) NCDC 218(0.79 %). Low galactose yogurt was prepared following standard procedure using Gal(+) S. thermophilus isolates and Gal(-) L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus NCDC 04 in 1:1 ratio. Among which low galactose yogurt by NCDC 659 combination contained less galactose 0.37 % followed by NCDC 661 (0.51 %), NCDC 660 (0.65 %) and reference Gal(-) NCDC 218 (0.98 %) after 4 h of fermentation. This study clearly reveals that Gal(+) S. thermophilus isolates can be paired with Gal(-) L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus for developing low galactose yogurt.
TI  - Effect of thermosonication on physicochemical, microbiological and sensorial characteristics of ayran during storage.
AB  - The aim of the study was to determine whether thermosonication extends the shelf  life of ayran, an acidic milk drink. The effect of thermosonication at different temperatures (60, 70 and 80 degrees C) and times (1, 3 and 5 min) on the physicochemical and microbiological characteristics, and sensorial properties of ayran during storage were investigated. According to the results, thermosonication applied at 60 degrees C decreased lower the bacteria counts, although the Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus counts decreased as the temperature and time increased. The yeast and mold levels in samples treated with thermosonication were <1 log CFU mL(-1) during storage period. The ayran samples had non-Newtonian behavior, and the consistency coefficients of the thermosonicated samples were significantly higher than that of the heat-treated samples. Regarding serum separation, the most effective thermosonication treatment was applied at 70 degrees C for 3 min. The sensory properties of the thermosonicated samples were better than the thermal-treated samples after storage.
TI  - Control of tyramine and histamine accumulation by lactic acid bacteria using bacteriocin forming lactococci.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the competitive effects of three bacteriocin producing strains of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis against two aminobiogenic lactic acid bacteria, i.e. the tyramine producing strain Enterococcus faecalis EF37 and the histamine producing strain Streptococcus thermophilus PRI60, inoculated at different initial concentrations (from 2 to 6 log cfu/ml). The results showed that the three L. lactis subsp. lactis strains were able to produce bacteriocins: in particular, L. lactis subsp. lactis VR84 and EG46 produced, respectively, nisin Z and lacticin 481, while for the strains CG27 the bacteriocin has not been yet identified, even if its peptidic nature has been demonstrated. The co-culture of E. faecalis EF37 in combination with lactococci significantly reduced the growth potential of this aminobiogenic strain, both in terms of growth rate and maximum cell concentration, depending on the initial inoculum level of E. faecalis. Tyramine accumulation was strongly reduced when E. faecalis EF37 was inoculated at 2 log cfu/ml and, to a lesser extent, at 3 log cfu/ml, as a result of a lower cell load of the aminobiogenic strain. All the lactococci were more efficient in inhibiting streptococci in comparison with E. faecalis EF37; in particular, L. lactis subsp. lactis VR84 induced the death of S. thermophilus PRI60 and allowed the detection of histamine traces only at higher streptococci inoculum levels (5-6 log cfu/ml). The other two lactococcal strains did not show a lethal action against S. thermophilus PRI60, but were able to reduce its growth extent and histamine accumulation, even if L. lactis subsp. lactis EG46 was less effective when the initial streptococci concentration was 5 and 6 log cfu/ml. This preliminary study has clarified some aspects regarding the ratio between bacteriocinogenic strains and aminobiogenic strains with respect to the possibility to accumulate BA and has also showed that different bacteriocins can have different effects on BA production on the same strain. This knowledge is essentially aimed to use bacteriocinogenic lactococci as a predictable strategy against aminobiogenic bacteria present in cheese or other fermented foods.
TI  - Functional implications and ubiquitin-dependent degradation of the peptide transporter Ptr2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
AB  - The peptide transporter Ptr2 plays a central role in di- or tripeptide import in  Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Although PTR2 transcription has been extensively analyzed in terms of upregulation by the Ubr1-Cup9 circuit, the structural and functional information for this transporter is limited. Here we identified 14 amino acid residues required for peptide import through Ptr2 based on the crystallographic information of Streptococcus thermophilus peptide transporter PepTst and based on the conservation of primary sequences among the proton-dependent oligopeptide transporters (POTs). Expression of Ptr2 carrying one of the 14 mutations of which the corresponding residues of PepTst are involved in peptide recognition, salt bridge interaction, or peptide translocation failed to enable ptr2Deltatrp1 cell growth in alanyl-tryptophan (Ala-Trp) medium. We observed that Ptr2 underwent rapid degradation after cycloheximide treatment (half-life, approximately 1 h), and this degradation depended on Rsp5 ubiquitin ligase. The ubiquitination of Ptr2 most likely occurs at the N-terminal lysines 16, 27, and 34. Simultaneous substitution of arginine for the three lysines fully prevented Ptr2 degradation. Ptr2 mutants of the presumed peptide-binding site (E92Q, R93K, K205R, W362L, and E480D) exhibited severe defects in peptide import and were subjected to Rsp5-dependent degradation when cells were moved to Ala-Trp medium, whereas, similar to what occurs in the wild-type Ptr2, mutant proteins of the intracellular gate were upregulated. These results suggest that Ptr2 undergoes quality control and the defects in peptide binding and the concomitant conformational change render Ptr2 subject to efficient ubiquitination and subsequent degradation.
TI  - Reconstituted yogurt from yogurt cultured milk powder mix has better overall characteristics than reconstituted yogurt from commercial yogurt powder.
AB  - For manufacture of commercial yogurt powder, yogurt has to go through a drying process, which substantially lowers the yogurt culture counts, so the potential health benefits of the yogurt culture bacteria are reduced. Also, upon reconstitution, commercial yogurt powder does not taste like yogurt and has an off-flavor. The objective was to study the microbial, physicochemical, and sensory characteristics of reconstituted yogurt from yogurt cultured milk powder (YCMP) mix and reconstituted yogurt from commercial yogurt powder (CYP). The CYP reconstituted yogurt was the control and YCMP mix reconstituted yogurt was the treatment. Microbial and physicochemical characteristics of the CYP reconstituted yogurt and YCMP mix reconstituted yogurt were analyzed daily for the first week and then weekly for a period of 8 wk. Sensory consumer testing of CYP reconstituted yogurt and YCMP mix reconstituted yogurt was conducted with 100 consumers. At 56 d, YCMP mix reconstituted yogurt had 5 log cfu/mL higher counts of Streptococcus thermophilus than the control (CYP reconstituted yogurt). Also, Lactobacillus bulgaricus counts of YCMP mix reconstituted yogurt were 6.55 log cfu/mL at 28 d and were 5.35 log cfu/mL at 56 d, whereas the CYP reconstituted yogurt from 28 d onwards had a count of <10 cfu/mL. The YCMP mix reconstituted yogurt also had significantly higher apparent viscosity and sensory scores for appearance, color, aroma, taste, thickness, overall liking, consumer acceptability, and purchase intent than CYP reconstituted yogurt. Overall, YCMP mix reconstituted yogurt had more desirable characteristics than CYP reconstituted yogurt.
TI  - Short communication: Viability of culture organisms in honey-enriched acidophilus-bifidus-thermophilus (ABT)-type fermented camel milk.
AB  - The aim of this research was to monitor the survival during refrigerated storage  of Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5 (A), Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis BB-12 (B), and Streptococcus thermophilus CHCC 742/2130 (T) in cultured dairy foods made from camel and, for comparison, cow milks supplemented with black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) honey and fermented by an acidophilus-bifidus-thermophilus (ABT)-type culture. Two liters of dromedary camel milk and 2 L of cow milk were heated to 90 degrees C and held for 10 min, then cooled to 40 degrees C. One half of both types of milk was fortified with black locust honey at the rate of 5.0% (wt/vol), whereas the other half was devoid of honey and served as a control. The camel and cow milks with and without honey were subsequently inoculated with ABT-5 culture and were fermented at 37 degrees C until a pH value of 4.6 was reached. Thereafter, the probiotic fermented milks were cooled to 15 degrees C in ice water and were each separated into 18 fractions that were transferred in sterile, tightly capped centrifuge tubes. After 24 h of cooling at 8 degrees C (d 0), the samples were stored at refrigeration temperature (4 degrees C). Three tubes of all 4 products (i.e., fermented camel and cow milks with and without honey) were taken at each sampling time (i.e., following 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 d of storage), and the counts of characteristic microorganisms and those of certain spoilage microbes (yeasts, molds, coliforms, Escherichia coli) were enumerated. The entire experimental program was repeated twice. The results showed that addition of black locust honey at 5% to heat-treated camel and cow milks did not influence the growth and survival of starter streptococci during production and subsequent refrigerated storage of fermented ABT milks. In contrast, honey improved retention of viability of B. animalis ssp. lactis BB-12 in the camel milk-based product during storage at 4 degrees C up to 5 wk. No spoilage organisms were detected in any of the samples tested in this study. In conclusion, supplementation of cultured dairy foods, especially those made from camel milk, with honey is recommended because honey is a healthy natural sweetener with a variety of beneficial microbiological, nutritional, and sensory properties.
TI  - Survival of Escherichia coli O157:H7 during manufacture and storage of white brined cheese.
AB  - Escherichia coli O157:H7 is a major foodborne pathogen that causes severe disease in humans. Survival of E. coli O157:H7 during processing and storage of white brined cheese was investigated. Cheeses were prepared using pasteurized milk inoculated with a 4 strain E. coli O157:H7 cocktail (7 log(10) CFU/g) with or without yogurt starter culture (Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus) and stored in 10% or 15% NaCl brine at 10 and 21 masculineC for 28 d. NaCl concentration, water activity (a(w)), pH, and numbers of E. coli O157:H7 and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were determined in cheese and brine. E. coli O157:H7 was able to survive in cheese stored in both brines at 10 and 21 masculineC regardless of the presence of starter LAB, although the latter significantly enhanced E. coli O157:H7 reduction in cheese or its brine at 10 masculineC. E. coli O157:H7 numbers were reduced by 2.6 and 3.4 log(10) CFU/g in cheese stored in 10% and 15% NaCl brine, respectively, in the presence of starter LAB and by 1.4 and 2.3 log(10) CFU/g, respectively, in the absence of starter LAB at 10 masculineC. The pathogen survived, but at lower numbers in the brines. The salt concentration of cheese stored in 10% brine remained about 5% during ripening, but in 15% brine, the NaCl level increased 1.6% to 8.1% (w/w) by 28 d. Values of pH and a(w) slightly decreased 1 d after exposure to brine and reached 5.5 to 6.6 and 0.88 to 0.94, respectively, in all treatments.
TI  - Effects of Streptococcus thermophilus on volatile sulfur compounds produced by Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Halitosis as oral malodour is an unpleasant odour caused by volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs). VSCs are produced primarily by anaerobic bacteria that abundantly produce proteinase as trypsin-like enzyme. General therapies, such as mouthwash and plaque control, do not provide a continuous effect on oral halitosis. Streptococcus thermophilus is a probiotic bacterium that is beneficial for human health. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of S. thermophilus on Porphyromonas gingivalis-producing VSCs and to analyze the inhibitory mechanism of halitosis. P. gingivalis was cultured with or without S. thermophilus, and the emission of VSCs from the spent culture medium was measured by gas chromatography. In order to analyze the inhibitory effect, the antibacterial activity of S. thermophilus against P. gingivalis was assessed. After the spent culture medium or whole bacterial of S. thermophilus was mixed with the spent culture medium of P. gingivalis, VSCs were again measured by gas chromatograph. When S. thermophilus and P. gingivalis were co-cultivated, VSCs were present at a lower level than those of single-cultured P. gingivalis. S. thermophilus inhibited growth of P. gingivalis, and the whole bacteria and the spent culture medium of S. thermophilus reduced emission of VSCs gas. S. thermophilus may reduce oral malodour by inhibition of P. gingivalis growth and neutralizing VSCs with their metabolites or themselves.
TI  - Cell growth and proteolytic activity of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus  helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and Streptococcus thermophilus in milk as affected by supplementation with peptide fractions.
AB  - The present investigation examined the effects of supplementation of milk peptide fractions produced by enzymatic hydrolysis on the fermentation of reconstituted skim milk (RSM). Changes in pH, cell growth, proteolytic activity, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity were monitored during fermentation of RSM by pure cultures of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and Streptococcus thermophilus. The study showed that supplementation with peptide fractions of different molecular weights did not significantly affect the bacterial growth in RSM. All bacteria showed an increased proteolytic activity in RSM supplemented with large peptides (>10 kDa), and L. helveticus in general exhibited the highest proteolytic activity among the bacteria studied. The ACE-inhibitory activity was observed to be the maximum in RSM supplemented with larger peptides (>10 kDa) for all bacteria. The results suggest that proteolysis by bacteria leads to increased production of ACE-inhibitory peptides compared to the supplemented peptides produced by enzymatic hydrolysis.
TI  - Microbial ecology dynamics reveal a succession in the core microbiota involved in the ripening of pasta filata caciocavallo pugliese cheese.
AB  - Pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA targeting RNA, community-level physiological profiles made with Biolog EcoPlates, proteolysis, and volatile component (VOC) analyses were mainly used to characterize the manufacture and ripening of the pasta filata cheese Caciocavallo Pugliese. Plate counts revealed that cheese manufacture affected the microbial ecology. The results agreed with those from culture-independent approaches. As shown by urea-PAGE, reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), and free-amino-acid (FAA) analyses, the extent of secondary proteolysis mainly increased after 30 to 45 days of ripening. VOCs and volatile free fatty acids (VFFA) were identified by a purge-and-trap method (PT) and solid-phase microextraction (SPME) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), respectively. Except for aldehydes, the levels of most of VOCs and VFFA mainly increased from 30 to 45 days onwards. As shown through pyrosequencing analysis, raw cows' milk was contaminated by Firmicutes (53%), Proteobacteria (39%), Bacteroidetes (7.8%), Actinobacteria (0.06%), and Fusobacteria (0.03%), with heterogeneity at the genus level. The primary starter Streptococcus thermophilus dominated the curd population. Other genera occurred at low incidence or sporadically. The microbial dynamics reflected on the overall physiological diversity. At 30 days, a microbial succession was clearly highlighted. The relative abundance of Streptococcus sp. and especially St. thermophilus decreased, while that of Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus sp., and especially Lactobacillus paracasei increased consistently. Despite the lower relative abundance compared to St. thermophilus, mesophilic lactobacilli were the only organisms positively correlated with the concentration of FAAs, area of hydrophilic peptide peaks, and several VOCs (e.g., alcohols, ketones, esters and all furans). This study showed that a core microbiota was naturally selected during middle ripening, which seemed to be the main factor responsible for cheese ripening.
TI  - High-throughput sequencing of microbial communities in Poro cheese, an artisanal  Mexican cheese.
AB  - The bacterial diversity and structure of Poro cheese, an artisanal food, was analysed by high-throughput sequencing (454 pyrosequencing) in order to gain insight about changes in bacterial communities associated with the cheese-making process. Dairy samples consisting of milk, fermented whey, curd and ripened cheese (during 7 and 60 d) were collected from three manufacturers located in the state of Tabasco, Mexico during dry (March-June) and rainy (August-November) seasons. Independently of producer and season, raw milk samples displayed the highest diversity in bacterial communities. In raw milk, genera found were Macrococcus, Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Lactobacillus and Enhydrobacter. Diversity in whey, curd and cheese was lower, principally containing Streptococcus and Lactobacillus; however, bacteria such as Staphylococcus, Acinetobacter, Chryseobacterium, Bacillus, Sediminibacter, Lactococcus and Enterococcus were occasionally present. After curdling step, the most dominant and abundant species were Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii.
TI  - CRISPR-Cas: an efficient tool for genome engineering of virulent bacteriophages.
AB  - Bacteriophages are now widely recognized as major players in a wide variety of ecosystems. Novel genes are often identified in newly isolated phages as well as in environmental metavirome studies. Most of these novel viral genes have unknown functions but appear to be coding for small, non-structural proteins. To understand their biological role, very efficient genetic tools are required to modify them, especially in the genome of virulent phages. We first show that specific point mutations and large deletions can be engineered in the genome of the virulent phage 2972 using the Streptococcus thermophilus CRISPR-Cas Type II-A system as a selective pressure to increase recombination efficiencies. Of significance, all the plaques tested contained recombinant phages with the desired mutation. Furthermore, we show that the CRISPR-Cas engineering system can be used to efficiently introduce a functional methyltransferase gene into a virulent phage genome. Finally, synthetic CRISPR bacteriophage insensitive mutants were constructed by cloning a spacer-repeat unit in a low-copy vector illustrating the possibility to target multiple regions of the phage genome. Taken together, this data shows that the CRISPR-Cas system is an efficient and adaptable tool for editing the otherwise intractable genomes of virulent phages and to better understand phage-host interactions.
TI  - The cation diffusion facilitator protein EmfA of Rhizobium etli belongs to a novel subfamily of Mn(2+)/Fe(2+) transporters conserved in alpha-proteobacteria.
AB  - Manganese (Mn(2+)) plays a key role in important cellular functions such as oxidative stress response and bacterial virulence. The mechanisms of Mn(2+) homeostasis are not fully understood, there are few data regarding the functional and taxonomic diversity of Mn(2+) exporters. Our recent phylogeny of the cation diffusion facilitator (CDF) family of transporters classified the bacterial Mn(2+)-CDF transporters characterized to date, Streptococcus pneumoniae MntE and Deinococcus radiodurans DR1236, into two monophyletic groups. DR1236 was shown to belong to the highly-diverse metal specificity clade VI, together with TtCzrB, a Zn(2+)/Cd(2+) transporter from Thermus thermophilus, the Fe(2+) transporter Sll1263 from Synechocystis sp and eight uncharacterized homologs whose potential Mn(2+)/Zn(2+)/Cd(2+)/Fe(2+) specificities could not be accurately inferred because only eleven proteins were grouped in this clade. A new phylogeny inferred from the alignment of 197 clade VI homologs revealed three novel subfamilies of uncharacterized proteins. Remarkably, one of them contained 91 uncharacterized alpha-proteobacteria transporters (46% of the protein data set) grouped into a single subfamily. The Mn(2+)/Fe(2+) specificity of this subfamily was proposed through the functional characterization of the Rhizobium etli RHE_CH03072 gene. This gene was upregulated by Mn(2+), Zn(2+), Cd(2+) and Fe(2+) but conferred only Mn(2+) resistance to R. etli. The expression of the RHE_CH03072 gene in an E. coli mntP/zitB/zntA mutant did not relieve either Zn(2+) or Mn(2+) stress but slightly increased its Fe(2+) resistance. These results indicate that the RHE_CH03072 gene, now designated as emfA, encodes for a bacterial Mn(2+)/Fe(2+) resistance CDF protein, having orthologs in more than 60 alpha-proteobacterial species.
TI  - Energy and ileal digestible amino Acid concentrations for growing pigs and performance of weanling pigs fed fermented or conventional soybean meal.
AB  - A new strategy of co-inoculating Bacillus subtilis MA139 with Streptococcus thermophilus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used to produce fermented soybean meal (FSBM). Three experiments were conducted to determine the concentration of digestible energy (DE) and metabolizable energy (ME) (Exp. 1), apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of amino acids (AA) (Exp. 2), and feeding value (Exp. 3) of FSBM produced by this new strategy (NFSB) compared with soybean meal (SBM) and conventionally available FSBM (Suprotein). In Exp. 1, twenty-four barrows (initial body weight [BW] of 32.2 +/-1.7 kg) were randomly allotted to 1 of 4 diets with 6 replicates per diet. A corn basal diet and 3 diets based on a mixture of corn and 1 of 3 soybean products listed above were formulated and the DE and ME contents were determined by the difference method. The results showed that there were no differences in DE and ME between SBM and either FSBM product (p>0.05). In Exp. 2, eight barrows (initial BW of 26.8+/-1.5 kg) were fitted with ileal T-cannulaes and used in a replicated 4x4 Latin square design. Three corn-starch-based diets were formulated using each of the 3 soybean products as the sole source of AA. A nitrogen-free diet was also formulated to measure endogenous losses of AA. The results showed that the SID of all AA except arginine and histidine was similar for NFSB and SBM (p>0.05), but Suprotein had greater (p<0.05) SID of most AA except lysine, aspartate, glycine and proline than NFSB. In Exp. 3, a total of 144 piglets (initial BW of 8.8+/-1.2 kg) were blocked by weight and fed 1 of 4 diets including a control diet with 24% SBM as well as diets containing 6% and 12% NFSB or 12% Suprotein added at the expense of SBM. During d 15 to 28, replacing SBM with 6% NFSB significantly improved average daily gain (ADG) and average daily feed intake (ADFI) (p<0.05) for nursery piglets. During the overall experiment, ADG of piglets fed diets containing 6% NFSB was significantly greater (p<0.05) than that of piglets fed SBM. In conclusion, fermentation with the new strategy did not affect the energy content or the AID and the SID of AA in SBM. However, inclusion of 6% NFSB in diets fed to nursery piglets improved performance after weaning likely as a result of better nutritional status and reduced immunological challenge.
TI  - Characterization of an Ebosin derivative produced by heterologous gene replacement in Streptomyces sp. 139.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ebosin is a novel exopolysaccharide (EPS) produced by Streptomyces sp. 139 and evidenced to possess an anti-rheumatic arthritis activity in vivo. The Ebosin biosynthesis gene cluster (ste) consists of 27 ORFs and ste7 has previously been demonstrated to code for a fucosyltransferase, which plays an essential role in the formation of repeating sugar units during Ebosin production. Aiming to generate derivatives of Ebosin for better activity, we replaced ste7 with a gene encoding for a glucosyltransferase (gtf) from Streptococcus thermophilus. RESULTS: This alteration resulted in a novel Ebosin derivative (EPS-7 g) with its monosaccharide composition dramatically changed, especially in the proportion of glucose which increased from 1.1% (Ebosin) to 84.01% (EPS-7 g). In an ELISA analysis, EPS-7 g exhibited a higher binding activity for IL-1R, as a competitor of interleukin-1, than that of Ebosin. It also exhibited a higher inhibitory effect on the activity of IL-1beta-converting enzyme and production of IL-1beta in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS). In addition, experiments with acute inflamed mice induced by croton oil showed a significantly higher anti-inflammatory activity of EPS-7 g compared with Ebosin. CONCLUSIONS: The new Ebosin derivative EPS-7 g is more bioactive than Ebosin evaluated by a series of experiments. This is the first report demonstrating a modification of EPS structure via heterologous gene replacement in Streptomyces.
TI  - Efficient genome engineering in eukaryotes using Cas9 from Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The Streptococcus thermophilus CRISPR3-Cas (StCas9) system has been shown to mediate DNA cleavage in its original host and in E. coli as well as in vitro. Here, we have reconstituted the StCas9 system in yeast and conducted a systematic optimization of the sgRNA structure, including the minimal length of tracrRNA, loop structure, Match II region, Bulge motif, the minimal length of guide sequence within the crRNA, tolerance of mismatches and target sequence preference. The optimal sgRNA design for the StCas9 system achieved up to 12 and 40 % targeting efficiencies in yeast and human cells, respectively. This study provides important insight into the sequence and structural requirements necessary to develop a targeted and highly efficient eukaryotic gene editing platform using CRISPR-Cas systems.
TI  - Antioxidant and antibacterial activities of sulphated polysaccharides from Pleurotus eryngii and Streptococcus thermophilus ASCC 1275.
AB  - Polysaccharides from Pleurotus eryngii (PEPS) and exopolysaccharides from Streptococcus thermophilus ASCC 1275 (ST1275 EPS) were sulphated, and antioxidant and antibacterial activities of sulphated and crude polysaccharides were determined. Degree of sulphonation of PEPS and ST1275 EPS was 0.69 and 0.31, respectively. Characteristic bands in FT-IR spectra indicated that the sulphate group was at the C6 position of the galactose skeleton. Antioxidant activities of PEPS and ST1275 EPS were significantly (P<0.05) improved after sulphonation. For tested crude and sulphated polysaccharides, sulphated PEPS had the largest inhibition zone against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Staphylococcus aureus CMCC 26003 while sulphated ST1275 EPS had the largest inhibition zone against Listeria monocytogenes CMCC 54001. Furthermore, sulphated PEPS had the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for E. coli ATCC 25922, and both sulphated PEPS and sulphated ST1275 EPS had the lowest MICs on S. aureus CMCC 26003 and L. monocytogenes CMCC 54001.
TI  - Development of a non-dairy probiotic fermented product based on almond milk and inulin.
AB  - A new fermented almond "milk" that combined the properties of both almonds and probiotics was considered to cover the current versatile health-promoting foods' demand. Almond milk fermentation with probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri and Streptococcus thermophilus was studied by using a Central Composite design with response surface methodology, and different factors (glucose, fructose, inulin and starters) were optimised to assure high probiotic survivals in the final product. The optimal formulation was physicochemically characterised throughout cold storage (28 days) and both probiotic survivals to in vitro digestion and proteolysis were quantified. Results showed that a high probiotic population (>107 cfu/mL) was obtained in the previously optimised almond milk throughout storage time, which correspond to the addition of 0.75 g of glucose/100 mL, 0.75 g of fructose/100 mL, 2 g/100 mL inulin and 6 mL/100 mL inoculum. Glucose was used as the main nutrient and the production of mannitol by L. reuteri was detected. The fermentation process increased the viscosity values, forming a weak gel structure, whose physical properties hardly changed. Probiotic bacteria notably survived (51%) to the in vitro digestion, surely related to the inulin presence, which would add value to the developed product by enhancing the potential health benefits of its consumption.
TI  - Effects of ingesting milk fermented by Lactococcus lactis H61 on skin health in young women: a randomized double-blind study.
AB  - We conducted a randomized double-blind trial to evaluate the effects of fermented milk produced using only Lactococcus lactis strain H61 as a starter bacterium (H61-fermented milk) on the general health and various skin properties of young women. Healthy female volunteers (n=23; age=19-21r) received H61-fermented milk (10(10) cfu of strain H61/d) or conventional yogurt (10(10) cfu of both Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus per day), as a reference food, daily for 4 wk. Before and at the end of 4 wk, blood samples were taken, and skin hydration (inner forearms and cheek) and melanin content, elasticity, and sebum content (cheek only) were measured. Skin hydration at the inner forearm was higher at wk 4 than at wk 0 in both groups. Sebum content in cheek rose significantly after intervention in the H61-fermented milk group, but not the conventional yogurt group. Other skin parameters did not differ in either group. Serum analysis showed that total protein concentration and platelet count were elevated and reactive oxygen species decreased in both groups after the intervention. Although H61-fermented milk and conventional yogurt had similar effects on skin status and some blood characteristics of participants, an increase of sebum content in cheek is preferable to H61-fermented milk. As skin lipids contribute to maintaining the skin barrier, H61-fermented milk would provide beneficial effects on skin for young women.
TI  - Pyrosequencing analysis of the microbial diversity of airag, khoormog and tarag,  traditional fermented dairy products of mongolia.
AB  - Here, we used pyrosequencing to obtain a detailed analysis of the microbial diversities of traditional fermented dairy products of Mongolia. From 22 Airag (fermented mare's milk), 5 Khoormog (fermented camel's milk) and 26 Tarag (fermented milk of cows, goats and yaks) samples collected in the Mongolian provinces of Arhangai, Bulgan, Dundgobi, Tov, Uburhangai and Umnugobi, we obtained a total of 81 operational taxonomic units, which were assigned to 15 families, 21 genera and 41 species in 3 phyla. The genus Lactobacillus is a core bacterial component of Mongolian fermented milks, and Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens and Lactobacillus delbrueckii were the predominant species of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in the Airag, Khoormog and Tarag samples, respectively. By using this pyrosequencing approach, we successfully detected most LAB species that have been isolated as well as seven LAB species that have not been found in our previous culture-based study. A subsequent analysis of the principal components of the samples revealed that L. delbrueckii, L. helveticus, L. kefiranofaciens and Streptococcus thermophilus were the main factors influencing the microbial diversity of these Mongolian traditional fermented dairy products and that this diversity correlated with the animal species from which the milk was sourced.
TI  - CRISPR-induced distributed immunity in microbial populations.
AB  - In bacteria and archaea, viruses are the primary infectious agents, acting as virulent, often deadly pathogens. A form of adaptive immune defense known as CRISPR-Cas enables microbial cells to acquire immunity to viral pathogens by recognizing specific sequences encoded in viral genomes. The unique biology of this system results in evolutionary dynamics of host and viral diversity that cannot be fully explained by the traditional models used to describe microbe-virus coevolutionary dynamics. Here, we show how the CRISPR-mediated adaptive immune response of hosts to invading viruses facilitates the emergence of an evolutionary mode we call distributed immunity - the coexistence of multiple, equally-fit immune alleles among individuals in a microbial population. We use an eco-evolutionary modeling framework to quantify distributed immunity and demonstrate how it emerges and fluctuates in multi-strain communities of hosts and viruses as a consequence of CRISPR-induced coevolution under conditions of low viral mutation and high relative numbers of viral protospacers. We demonstrate that distributed immunity promotes sustained diversity and stability in host communities and decreased viral population density that can lead to viral extinction. We analyze sequence diversity of experimentally coevolving populations of Streptococcus thermophilus and their viruses where CRISPR-Cas is active, and find the rapid emergence of distributed immunity in the host population, demonstrating the importance of this emergent phenomenon in evolving microbial communities.
TI  - The yogurt amino acid profile's variation during the shelf-life.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the yogurt amino acid profile starting from marketing through the whole shelf-life. The evaluation of the proteolytic activity of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, allows to deduce their vitality during the shelf-life period and within 45 days. METHODS: Three types of full fats yogurts have been analyzed (a) natural white (b) sweet white and (c) whole fruit - in two stages: t0 (first day of shelf-life) and t1 (end of shelf-life). The proteins have been analyzed by the Kjeldahl method and the amino acid profile by HPLC. RESULTS: In natural yogurt a significant increase of the amount of free amino acids has been observed during the period of shelf-life (97%). In the sweetened full fats and fruit yogurt, instead, there is a lower increase of respectively 33% and 39% CONCLUSIONS: In whole milk natural yogurt, based on our data, the proteolytic activity seems to persist during the entire period of the shelf-life and this can be considered an index of bacterial survival, especially of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus during the marketing process.
TI  - Synbiotic in the management of infantile colic: a randomised controlled trial.
AB  - AIM: Infant colic is a frequent problem affecting up to 10-30% of infants in first 3 months of life. Results from previous trials have shown that manipulation of gut microbiota can lead to symptomatic improvements. In a randomised clinical trial, we aimed to determine efficacy of synbiotic in reducing average infant crying time at day 7 and day 30 after starting intervention. METHODS: Fifty breastfed infants aged 15-120 days with infantile colic randomly assigned to receive either the synbiotic sachet containing 1 billion CFU of: Lactobacillus casei, L. rhamnosus, Streptococcus thermophilus, Bifidobacterium breve, L. acidophilus, B. infantis, L. bulgaricus and fructooligosacharide (Protexin Healthcare, Somerset, UK), or placebo daily for 30 days. Parents were asked to record details of crying times in a symptoms diary. The primary outcome measure was the treatment success (reduction in the daily crying time >50%) and the secondary outcome measure was symptom resolution (reduction in the daily crying time >90%). RESULTS: The treatment success was significantly higher in synbiotic group (82.6%) compared with placebo (35.7%) at day 7 (P < 0.005). At day30, treatment success was 87% and 46% in synbiotic and placebo group, respectively (P < 0.01). Symptom resolution was also higher in synbiotic group (39%) compared with placebo (7%) at day 7 (P < 0.03) but not at day 30 (56% vs.36%, P = 0.24). We encountered no complication related to synbiotic use. CONCLUSION: This synbiotic (a mixture of seven probiotic strains plus FOS) significantly improved colic symptoms in comparison with placebo.
TI  - NADH Oxidase of Streptococcus thermophilus 1131 is Required for the Effective Yogurt Fermentation with Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 2038.
AB  - We previously reported that dissolved oxygen (DO) suppresses yogurt fermentation  with an industrial starter culture composed of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (L. bulgaricus) 2038 and Streptococcus thermophilus 1131, and also found that reducing the DO in the medium prior to fermentation (deoxygenated fermentation) shortens the fermentation time. In this study, we found that deoxygenated fermentation primarily increased the cell number of S. thermophilus 1131 rather than that of L. bulgaricus 2038, resulting in earlier l-lactate and formate accumulation. Measurement of the DO concentration and hydrogen peroxide generation in the milk medium suggested that DO is mainly removed by S. thermophilus 1131. The results using an H2O-forming NADH oxidase (Nox)-defective mutant of S. thermophilus 1131 revealed that Nox is the major oxygen-consuming enzyme of the bacterium. Yogurt fermentation with the S. thermophilus Deltanox mutant and L. bulgaricus 2038 was significantly slower than with S. thermophilus 1131 and L. bulgaricus 2038, and the DO concentrations of the mixed culture did not decrease to less than 2 mg/kg within 3 hr. These observations suggest that Nox of S. thermophilus 1131 contributes greatly to yogurt fermentation, presumably by removing the DO in milk.
TI  - Structural basis for polyspecificity in the POT family of proton-coupled oligopeptide transporters.
AB  - An enigma in the field of peptide transport is the structural basis for ligand promiscuity, as exemplified by PepT1, the mammalian plasma membrane peptide transporter. Here, we present crystal structures of di- and tripeptide-bound complexes of a bacterial homologue of PepT1, which reveal at least two mechanisms for peptide recognition that operate within a single, centrally located binding site. The dipeptide was orientated laterally in the binding site, whereas the tripeptide revealed an alternative vertical binding mode. The co-crystal structures combined with functional studies reveal that biochemically distinct peptide-binding sites likely operate within the POT/PTR family of proton-coupled symporters and suggest that transport promiscuity has arisen in part through the ability of the binding site to accommodate peptides in multiple orientations for transport.
TI  - Production of folate in oat bran fermentation by yeasts isolated from barley and  diverse foods.
AB  - AIMS: The focus of the research was to identify yeasts from barley kernels in order to study their folate production capability while maintaining high viscosity caused by soluble fibres in oat bran fermentation. METHODS AND RESULTS: The 65 isolated yeasts were characterized by API carbohydrate utilization tests, and assays for extracellular enzyme activities were the following: amylase, beta-glucanase, cellulase or CMCase, lipase, protease and xylanase. Yeasts were identified by partial DNA sequencing of the 25S D1/D2 and ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 regions. They belonged to the genera Aureobasidium, Cryptococcus, Pseudozyma and Rhodotorula. Folate production was determined from supernatant and cells grown in a rich laboratory medium or directly from oat bran solution inoculated with the appropriate yeast. Food yeasts, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida milleri, Kluyveromyces marxianus and Galactomyces geotrichum, were used for comparison. Most of the yeasts isolated from barley destroyed the solid, viscous structure of the oat bran solution, indicating that they degraded the viscosity-generating soluble fibres, considered to be nutritionally advantageous. The best folate producers were S. cerevisiae, followed by Pseudozyma sp., Rhodotorula glutinis and K. marxianus. The yeasts maintaining high viscosity were used together with lactic acid bacteria (LAB) Streptococcus thermophilus or Lactobacillus rhamnosus to ferment oat bran solution. None of the yeasts isolated from barley, contrary to S. cerevisiae and C. milleri, produced together with LAB significant amounts of folate. CONCLUSIONS: Fermentative yeasts together with LAB are potential for use in developing novel high folate content healthy foods and snacks from oat bran. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: High soluble fibre content and high natural folate content but low energy content food and snack products with pleasant fermentation aroma provide possibilities for new developments in the food industry.
TI  - Combination of heterogeneous catalase and superoxide dismutase protects Bifidobacterium longum strain NCC2705 from oxidative stress.
AB  - Bifidobacteria are generally sensitive to oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS). To improve oxidative-stress tolerance, the superoxide dismutase (SOD) gene from Streptococcus thermophilus (StSodA) and the heme-dependent catalase (KAT) gene from Lactobacillus plantarum (LpKatL) were heterologously expressed in Bifidobacterium longum strain NCC2705. Three types of strain NCC2705 transformants were obtained: with transgenic SOD expression, with transgenic KAT expression, and with coexpression of the two genes. Intracellular expression of the genes and their functional role in oxidative-stress resistance were evaluated. In response to oxidative stress, B. longum NCC2705/pDP401-LpKatL (expressing LpKatL) and NCC2705/pDP-Kat-Sod (coexpressing LpKatL and StSodA) rapidly degraded exogenous H2O2 and the peroxides generated as a byproduct of aerobic cultivation, preventing oxidative damage to DNA and RNA. Individual expression of StSodA or LpKatL both improved B. longum NCC2705 cell viability. Survival rate of strain NCC2705 was further improved by combining SOD and KAT expression. The two enzymes played complementary roles in ROS-scavenging pathways, and coexpression led to a synergistic beneficial effect under conditions of intensified oxidative stress. Our results illustrate that heterogeneous expression of heme-dependent KAT and Mn(2+)-dependent SOD is functional in the B. longum oxidative-stress response, and synergistic protection is achieved when their expressions are combined.
TI  - The naturally competent strain Streptococcus thermophilus LMD-9 as a new tool to  anchor heterologous proteins on the cell surface.
AB  - BACKGROUND: From fundamental studies to industrial processes, synthesis of heterologous protein by micro-organisms is widely employed. The secretion of soluble heterologous proteins in the extracellular medium facilitates their recovery, while their attachment to the cell surface permits the use of the recombinant host cells as protein or peptide supports. One of the key points to carry out heterologous expression is to choose the appropriate host. We propose to enlarge the panel of heterologous secretion hosts by using Streptococcus thermophilus LMD-9. This lactic acid bacterium has a generally recognised as safe status, is widely used in the manufacture of yogurts, fermented milks and cheeses, and is easy to transform by natural competence. This study demonstrates the feasibility of secretion of a heterologous protein anchored to the cell surface by S. thermophilus. For this, we used the cell envelope proteinase (CEP) PrtH of Lactobacillus helveticus CNRZ32 CIRM-BIA 103. RESULTS: Using S. thermophilus LMD-9 as the background host, three recombinant strains were constructed: i) a negative control corresponding to S. thermophilus PrtS- mutant where the prtS gene encoding its CEP was partially deleted; ii) a PrtH+ mutant expressing the L. helveticus PrtH pro-protein with its own motif (S-layer type) of cell-wall attachment and iii) a PrtH+WANS mutant expressing PrtH pro-protein with the LPXTG anchoring motif from PrtS. The PrtH+ and PrtH+WANS genes expression levels were measured by RT-qPCR in the corresponding mutants and compared to that of prtS gene in the strain LMD-9. The expression levels of both fused prtH CEPs genes, regardless of the anchoring motif, reached up-to more than 76% of the wild-type prtS expression level. CEPs were sought and identified on the cell surface of LMD-9 wild-type strain, PrtH+ and PrtH+WANS mutants using shaving technique followed by peptide identification with tandem mass spectrometry, demonstrating that the heterologous secretion and anchoring of a protein of more than 200 kDa was efficient. The anchoring to the cell-wall seems to be more efficient when the LPXTG motif of PrtS was used instead of the S-layer motif of PrtH. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated S. thermophilus LMD-9 could heterologously secrete a high molecular weight protein and probably covalently anchor it to the cell-wall.
TI  - Effect of green tea supplementation on the microbiological, antioxidant, and sensory properties of probiotic milks.
AB  - Green tea and its constituents are known for a wide range of health-promoting properties. They may exert antimicrobial action but without altering lactic acid bacteria. The aim of the present study was to estimate the effect of green tea addition on the selected properties of probiotic milks. Bioyogurts (fermented with ABT-1 coculture of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12) and acidophilus milks (fermented with pure L. acidophilus LA-5 culture) with addition of 0, 5, 10, or 15% (v/v) green tea infusion (GTI) were produced and analyzed for the antioxidant capacity by the "diphenyl picrylhydrazyl" (DPPH) and "ferric-reducing antioxidant power" (FRAP) methods, acidity, the count of starter bacteria, and sensory properties at the 1st, 7th, 14th, and 21st day of cold storage. The 15% addition of GTI to the acidophilus milk significantly reduced the lactic acid production during the whole study. The GTI had no impact on the level of S. thermophilus and B. lactis BB-12 in bioyogurts, and its effect on the count of L. acidophilus LA-5 depended on the concentration and probiotic milk type. GTI similarly and in a dose-dependent manner enhanced the antioxidant capacity of both milk types. There were no significant differences between the sensory notes received for bioyogurts, whereas acidophilus milks with tea were less appreciated by the panelists. In conclusion, green tea could be successfully used as a functional additive for selected probiotic milks enhancing their health benefits, but the proper selection of tea additive and starter culture is recommended.
TI  - Group A streptococcus inhibitors by high-throughput virtual screening.
AB  - Group A streptococcus (GAS) is a Gram-positive bacterium, which can cause multiple types of disease from mild infections of skin and throat to invasive and life-threatening infections. Recently RNase J1 and J2 were found to be essential for the growth of GAS. In order to identify inhibitors against RNase J1/J2, homology models of both the ligand-free apo-form and the ligand-bound holo-form complexes were constructed as templates for high-throughput virtual screening (HTVS). A focused small molecule library and the commercially available Maybridge database were employed as sources for potential inhibitors. A cell-based biological assay identified two compounds with 10 muM MIC activity.
TI  - Control of natural transformation in salivarius Streptococci through specific degradation of sigmaX by the MecA-ClpCP protease complex.
AB  - Competence for natural DNA transformation is a tightly controlled developmental process in streptococci. In mutans and salivarius species, the abundance of the central competence regulator sigma(X) is regulated at two levels: transcriptional, by the ComRS signaling system via the sigma(X)/ComX/SigX-inducing peptide (XIP), and posttranscriptional, by the adaptor protein MecA and its associated Clp ATPase, ClpC. In this study, we further investigated the mechanism and function of the MecA-ClpC control system in the salivarius species Streptococcus thermophilus. Using in vitro approaches, we showed that MecA specifically interacts with both sigma(X) and ClpC, suggesting the formation of a ternary sigma(X)-MecA-ClpC complex. Moreover, we demonstrated that MecA ultimately targets sigma(X) for its degradation by the ClpCP protease in an ATP-dependent manner. We also identify a short sequence (18 amino acids) in the N-terminal domain of sigma(X) as essential for the interaction with MecA and subsequent sigma(X) degradation. Finally, increased transformability of a MecA-deficient strain in the presence of subinducing XIP concentrations suggests that the MecA-ClpCP proteolytic complex acts as an additional locking device to prevent competence under inappropriate conditions. A model of the interplay between ComRS and MecA-ClpCP in the control of sigma(X) activity is proposed.
TI  - Bacteriophage-insensitive mutants for high quality Crescenza manufacture.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus is a thermophilic lactic acid bacterium used as starter culture for the manufacture of fermented dairy products. For the production of Crescenza and other soft cheeses, Sacco has developed and provides dairies with three different defined blends of S. thermophilus strains. Each blend contains two different S. thermophilus strains. The strains were selected based on their unique technological properties as well as different phage profiles. Analysis of 133 whey samples collected in 2009-2010 from Italian dairies showed a high prevalence (about 50%) of bacteriophage attacks on the blend ST020. More specifically, the strain S. thermophilus ST1A was found to be the preferred target of the bacteriophages. A bacteriophage insensitive mutant (BIM5) of the phage-sensitive strain ST1A was successfully developed and used to substitute strain ST1A in the Crescenza starter culture ST020. The strain BIM5 showed identical technological and industrial traits as those of the phage-sensitive strain ST1A. The improved resistance of the modified Crescenza starter culture ST020R was confirmed at Italian dairies, and its effectiveness monitored on 122 whey samples collected in 2011-2012. Compared to the previous values (2009-2010), the use of the phage-hardened blend ST020R allowed reducing of frequency of phage attacks from about 50 to less than 5% of the whey samples investigated.
TI  - Genomic insights into high exopolysaccharide-producing dairy starter bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus ASCC 1275.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus ASCC 1275 (ST 1275), a typical dairy starter bacterium, yields the highest known amount (~1,000 mg/L) of exopolysaccharide (EPS) in milk among the species of S. thermophilus. The addition of this starter in milk fermentation exhibited texture modifying properties for fermented dairy foods such as yogurt and cheese in the presence of EPS as its important metabolite. In this genomic study, a novel eps gene cluster for EPS assembly of repeating unit has been reported. It contains two-pair epsC-epsD genes which are assigned to determine the chain length of EPS. This also suggests this organism produces two types of EPSs - capsular and ropy EPS, as observed in our previous studies. Additionally, ST 1275 appears to exhibit effective proteolysis system and sophisticated stress response systems to stressful conditions, and has the highest number of four separate CRISPR/Cas loci. These features may be conducive to milk adaptation of this starter and against undesirable bacteriophage infections which leads to failure of milk fermentation. Insights into the genome of ST 1275 suggest that this strain may be a model high EPS-producing dairy starter.
TI  - The three major types of CRISPR-Cas systems function independently in CRISPR RNA  biogenesis in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - CRISPR-Cas systems are small RNA-based immune systems that protect prokaryotes from invaders such as viruses and plasmids. We have investigated the features and biogenesis of the CRISPR (cr)RNAs in Streptococcus thermophilus (Sth) strain DGCC7710, which possesses four different CRISPR-Cas systems including representatives from the three major types of CRISPR-Cas systems. Our results indicate that the crRNAs from each CRISPR locus are specifically processed into divergent crRNA species by Cas proteins (and non-coding RNAs) associated with the respective locus. We find that the Csm Type III-A and Cse Type I-E crRNAs are specifically processed by Cas6 and Cse3 (Cas6e), respectively, and retain an 8-nucleotide CRISPR repeat sequence tag 5' of the invader-targeting sequence. The Cse Type I-E crRNAs also retain a 21-nucleotide 3' repeat tag. The crRNAs from the two Csn Type II-A systems in Sth consist of a 5'-truncated targeting sequence and a 3' tag; however, these are distinct in size between the two. Moreover, the Csn1 (Cas9) protein associated with one Csn locus functions specifically in the production of crRNAs from that locus. Our findings indicate that multiple CRISPR-Cas systems can function independently in crRNA biogenesis within a given organism - an important consideration in engineering coexisting CRISPR-Cas pathways.
TI  - Enzymatic synthesis of bioinformatically predicted microcin C-like compounds encoded by diverse bacteria.
AB  - ABSTRACT The Trojan horse Escherichia coli antibiotic microcin C (McC) consists of a heptapeptide attached to adenosine through a phosphoramidate linkage. McC is synthesized by the MccB enzyme, which terminally adenylates the ribosomally synthesized heptapeptide precursor MccA. The peptide part is responsible for McC uptake; it is degraded inside the cell to release a toxic nonhydrolyzable aspartyl-adenylate. Bionformatic analysis reveals that diverse bacterial genomes encoding mccB homologues also contain adjacent short open reading frames that may encode MccA-like adenylation substrates. Using chemically synthesized predicted peptide substrates and recombinant cognate MccB protein homologs, adenylated products were obtained in vitro for predicted MccA peptide-MccB enzyme pairs from Helicobacter pylori, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus johnsonii, Bartonella washoensis, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and Synechococcus sp. Some adenylated products were shown to inhibit the growth of E. coli by targeting aspartyl-tRNA synthetase, the target of McC. IMPORTANCE Our results prove that McC-like adenylated peptides are widespread and are encoded by both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and by cyanobacteria, opening ways for analyses of physiological functions of these compounds and for creation of microcin C-like antibiotics targeting various bacteria.
TI  - A Probiotic Preparation Duolac-Gold Ameliorates Dextran Sulphate Sodium-induced Mouse Colitis by Downregulating the Expression of IL-6.
AB  - Probiotics are live microorganisms that confer a health benefit on the host. Duolac-Gold is a mixture of six probiotic bacteria containing three species of Bifidobacteria, two species of Lactobacillus, and Streptococcus thermophilus [corrected]. The aim of this study was to assess the anti-inflammatory effects of Duolac-Gold in an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) mouse model. IBD was induced by administering 1.5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for 10 days. After induction of DSS-induced colitis, Duolac-Gold was orally administered at three different concentrations. Interestingly, Duolac-Gold treatment accelerated IBD healing, and anti-inflammatory activity was assessed by weight loss, length of the colon, and a microscopic damage score by histology. The expression of inflammatory related cytokines was measured in colon tissues and serum. Of these cytokines, the expression of interleukin-6 decreased remarkably after Duolac-Gold treatment. Taken together, these results suggest that Duolac-Gold treatment is effective in IBD healing by regulating IL-6.
TI  - Characterization of tetA-like gene encoding for a major facilitator superfamily efflux pump in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Efflux pumps are membrane proteins involved in the active extrusion of a wide range of structurally dissimilar substrates from cells. A multidrug efflux pump named TetA belonging to the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of transporters was identified in the Streptococcus thermophilus DSM 20617(T) genome. The tetA-like gene was found in the genomes of a number of S. thermophilus strains sequenced to date and in Streptococcus macedonicus ACA-DC 198, suggesting a possible horizontal gene transfer event between these two Streptococcus species, which are both adapted to the milk environment. Flow cytometry (single-cell) analysis revealed bistable TetA activity in the S. thermophilus population, and tetA-like gene over-expression resulted in a reduced susceptibility to ethidium bromide, tetracycline, and other toxic compounds even when the efflux pump was over-expressed in a strain naturally lacking tetA-like gene.
TI  - Evaluation of the effects of a probiotic supplementation with respect to placebo  on intestinal microflora and secretory IgA production, during antibiotic therapy, in children affected by recurrent airway infections and skin symptoms.
AB  - Antibiotic therapy, especially in pediatric patients, is often associated with significant modifications of the gut microflora, which can lead to intestinal dysbiosis and influence intestinal physiology and immune system functionality. Herein we report the results from a double blind controlled clinical trial in 77 pediatric patients affected by recurrent airway infections, receiving antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid. A group was treated with an oral probiotic preparation composed of Lactobacillus paracasei ssp.paracasei CRL-431, Bifidobacterium BB-12, Streptococcus thermophilus TH-4 and a fructooligosaccharide (FOS) during and after antibiotic therapy for seven days, while the other group received placebo. The study revealed a reduction in the Clostridia population, with a contemporary increase in Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli in fecal samples in the probiotic group and an increase in the Enterobacteria population in the placebo group. Moreover, there was a decreasing trend in secretory IgA production in the probiotic group. Some relevant, but not statistically significant probiotic supplementation effects were identified.
TI  - Probiotic viability and storage stability of yogurts and fermented milks prepared with several mixtures of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Currently, the food industry wants to expand the range of probiotic yogurts but each probiotic bacteria offers different and specific health benefits. Little information exists on the influence of probiotic strains on physicochemical properties and sensory characteristics of yogurts and fermented milks. Six probiotic yogurts or fermented milks and 1 control yogurt were prepared, and we evaluated several physicochemical properties (pH, titratable acidity, texture, color, and syneresis), microbial viability of starter cultures (Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus) and probiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus reuteri) during fermentation and storage (35 d at 5 degrees C), as well as sensory preference among them. Decreases in pH (0.17 to 0.50 units) and increases in titratable acidity (0.09 to 0.29%) were observed during storage. Only the yogurt with S. thermophilus, L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and L. reuteri differed in firmness. No differences in adhesiveness were determined among the tested yogurts, fermented milks, and the control. Syneresis was in the range of 45 to 58%. No changes in color during storage were observed and no color differences were detected among the evaluated fermented milk products. Counts of S. thermophilus decreased from 1.8 to 3.5 log during storage. Counts of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus also decreased in probiotic yogurts and varied from 30 to 50% of initial population. Probiotic bacteria also lost viability throughout storage, although the 3 probiotic fermented milks maintained counts >/= 10(7)cfu/mL for 3 wk. Probiotic bacteria had variable viability in yogurts, maintaining counts of L. acidophilus >/= 10(7) cfu/mL for 35 d, of L. casei for 7d, and of L. reuteri for 14 d. We found no significant sensory preference among the 6 probiotic yogurts and fermented milks or the control. However, the yogurt and fermented milk made with L. casei were better accepted. This study presents relevant information on physicochemical, sensory, and microbial properties of probiotic yogurts and fermented milks, which could guide the dairy industry in developing new probiotic products.
TI  - Antiradical and tea polyphenol-stabilizing ability of functional fermented soymilk-tea beverage.
AB  - This study examined the potential of two-step fermentation to preserve TPs in functional soy-tea beverage. Fermented soymilk-tea (FST) was produced by culturing Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Bifidobacterium longum in soymilk supplemented with tea extract (TE). Total phenolic content (TPC) and anti-radical activities were determined for FSTs and fermented soymilk (FS). A HPLC method was employed to quantify nine major tea phenolics in FST products. TPC was significantly higher (p<0.05) in FST than FS, in the order of green tea>oolong tea>black tea>soymilk. The FSTs were effective at scavenging DPPH-radical rather than hydroxyl radical. Optimal pH to stabilize TPs in SMT was ca. 5.7, which reduced total TP loss by ca. 40% compared with that obtained from products with TE supplemented at the beginning of fermentation. A gradual decrease in TPs was observed during storage (4 degrees C), with more than half of total TPs remained in FST after 8 weeks.
TI  - Comparative genomics of the dairy isolate Streptococcus macedonicus ACA-DC 198 against related members of the Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Within the genus Streptococcus, only Streptococcus thermophilus is used as a starter culture in food fermentations. Streptococcus macedonicus though, which belongs to the Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex (SBSEC), is also frequently isolated from fermented foods mainly of dairy origin. Members of the SBSEC have been implicated in human endocarditis and colon cancer. Here we compare the genome sequence of the dairy isolate S. macedonicus ACA-DC 198 to the other SBSEC genomes in order to assess in silico its potential adaptation to milk and its pathogenicity status. RESULTS: Despite the fact that the SBSEC species were found tightly related based on whole genome phylogeny of streptococci, two distinct patterns of evolution were identified among them. Streptococcus macedonicus, Streptococcus infantarius CJ18 and Streptococcus pasteurianus ATCC 43144 seem to have undergone reductive evolution resulting in significantly diminished genome sizes and increased percentages of potential pseudogenes when compared to Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus. In addition, the three species seem to have lost genes for catabolizing complex plant carbohydrates and for detoxifying toxic substances previously linked to the ability of S. gallolyticus to survive in the rumen. Analysis of the S. macedonicus genome revealed features that could support adaptation to milk, including an extra gene cluster for lactose and galactose metabolism, a proteolytic system for casein hydrolysis, auxotrophy for several vitamins, an increased ability to resist bacteriophages and horizontal gene transfer events with the dairy Lactococcus lactis and S. thermophilus as potential donors. In addition, S. macedonicus lacks several pathogenicity-related genes found in S. gallolyticus. For example, S. macedonicus has retained only one (i.e. the pil3) of the three pilus gene clusters which may mediate the binding of S. gallolyticus to the extracellular matrix. Unexpectedly, similar findings were obtained not only for the dairy S. infantarius CJ18, but also for the blood isolate S. pasteurianus ATCC 43144. CONCLUSIONS: Our whole genome analyses suggest traits of adaptation of S. macedonicus to the nutrient-rich dairy environment. During this process the bacterium gained genes presumably important for this new ecological niche. Finally, S. macedonicus carries a reduced number of putative SBSEC virulence factors, which suggests a diminished pathogenic potential.
TI  - Surface display of a bifunctional glutathione synthetase on Saccharomyces cerevisiae for converting chicken feather hydrolysate into glutathione.
AB  - The low economic profits of feather recycling lead that the large amount of feathers is currently discarded in China. To convert feather hydrolysates into GSH with high values, surface display of the bifunctional glutathione synthetase encoded by gcsgs from Streptococcus thermophilus on Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the potential in glutathione (GSH) production from feather hydrolysates were studied. The surface-displayed GCSGS could be used to convert feather hydrolysates into GSH. Results showed that 10 g/l of feather was converted into 321.8 mg/l GSH by the Trichoderma atroviride F6 and surface-displayed GCSGS in the study. Compared with production of intracellular GSH by S. cerevisiae from amino acids or feather hydrolysate, the concentration of GSH in the study was higher, and purification of GSH was more feasible. Due to the glycolytic pathway, the S. cerevisiae was used to generate ATP and cheap feather hydrolysate as precursors, the process for GSH production based on surface-displayed GCSGS is cheap and feasible. The process showed the potential to convert feather hydrolysates into GSH on an industrial scale.
TI  - Lactose digestion from yogurt: mechanism and relevance.
AB  - Yogurt is traditionally consumed throughout the world among populations who are seemingly unable to digest lactose. This review provides a historical overview of the studies that show lactose digestion and tolerance from yogurt by lactose-intolerant people. The lactose in yogurt is digested more efficiently than other dairy sources of lactose because the bacteria inherent in yogurt assist with its digestion. The bacterial lactase survives the acidic conditions of the stomach, apparently being physically protected within the bacterial cells and facilitated by the buffering capacity of yogurt. The increasing pH as the yogurt enters the small intestine and a slower gastrointestinal transit time allow the bacterial lactase to be active, digesting lactose from yogurt sufficiently to prevent symptoms in lactose-intolerant people. There is little difference in the lactase capability of different commercial yogurts, because they apparently contain Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus in sufficient quantities (10(8) bacteria/mL). However, Lactobacillus acidophilus appears to require cell membrane disruption to physically release the lactase. Compared with unflavored yogurts, flavored yogurts appear to exhibit somewhat reduced lactase activity but are still well tolerated.
TI  - Temperate Streptococcus thermophilus phages expressing superinfection exclusion proteins of the Ltp type.
AB  - Lipoprotein Ltp encoded by temperate Streptococcus thermophilus phage TP-J34 is the prototype of the wide-spread family of host cell surface-exposed lipoproteins involved in superinfection exclusion (sie). When screening for other S. thermophilus phages expressing this type of lipoprotein, three temperate phages-TP-EW, TP-DSM20617, and TP-778-were isolated. In this communication we present the total nucleotide sequences of TP-J34 and TP-778L. For TP-EW, a phage almost identical to TP-J34, besides the ltp gene only the two regions of deviation from TP-J34 DNA were analyzed: the gene encoding the tail protein causing an assembly defect in TP-J34 and the gene encoding the lysin, which in TP-EW contains an intron. For TP-DSM20617 only the sequence of the lysogeny module containing the ltp gene was determined. The region showed high homology to the same region of TP-778. For TP-778 we could show that absence of the attR region resulted in aberrant excision of phage DNA. The amino acid sequence of mature LtpTP-EW was shown to be identical to that of mature LtpTP-J34, whereas the amino acid sequence of mature LtpTP-778 was shown to differ from mature LtpTP-J34 in eight amino acid positions. LtpTP-DSM20617 was shown to differ from LtpTP-778 in just one amino acid position. In contrast to LtpTP-J34, LtpTP-778 did not affect infection of lactococcal phage P008 instead increased activity against phage P001 was noticed.
TI  - Salivary microbiota and metabolome associated with celiac disease.
AB  - This study aimed to investigate the salivary microbiota and metabolome of 13 children with celiac disease (CD) under a gluten-free diet (treated celiac disease [T-CD]). The same number of healthy children (HC) was used as controls. The salivary microbiota was analyzed by an integrated approach using culture-dependent and -independent methods. Metabolome analysis was carried out by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-solid-phase microextraction. Compared to HC, the number of some cultivable bacterial groups (e.g., total anaerobes) significantly (P < 0.05) differed in the saliva samples of the T-CD children. As shown by community-level catabolic profiles, the highest Shannon's diversity and substrate richness were found in HC. Pyrosequencing data showed the highest richness estimator and diversity index values for HC. Levels of Lachnospiraceae, Gemellaceae, and Streptococcus sanguinis were highest for the T-CD children. Streptococcus thermophilus levels were markedly decreased in T-CD children. The saliva of T-CD children showed the largest amount of Bacteroidetes (e.g., Porphyromonas sp., Porphyromonas endodontalis, and Prevotella nanceiensis), together with the smallest amount of Actinobacteria. T-CD children were also characterized by decreased levels of some Actinomyces species, Atopobium species, and Corynebacterium durum. Rothia mucilaginosa was the only Actinobacteria species found at the highest level in T-CD children. As shown by multivariate statistical analyses, the levels of organic volatile compounds markedly differentiated T-CD children. Some compounds (e.g., ethyl-acetate, nonanal, and 2-hexanone) were found to be associated with T-CD children. Correlations (false discovery rate [FDR], <0.05) were found between the relative abundances of bacteria and some volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The findings of this study indicated that CD is associated with oral dysbiosis that could affect the oral metabolome.
TI  - Structural and functional analysis of a FeoB A143S G5 loop mutant explains the accelerated GDP release rate.
AB  - GTPases (G proteins) hydrolyze the conversion of GTP to GDP and free phosphate, comprising an integral part of prokaryotic and eukaryotic signaling, protein biosynthesis and cell division, as well as membrane transport processes. The G protein cycle is brought to a halt after GTP hydrolysis, and requires the release of GDP before a new cycle can be initiated. For eukaryotic heterotrimeric Galphabetagamma proteins, the interaction with a membrane-bound G protein-coupled receptor catalyzes the release of GDP from the Galpha subunit. Structural and functional studies have implicated one of the nucleotide binding sequence motifs, the G5 motif, as playing an integral part in this release mechanism. Indeed, a Galphas G5 mutant (A366S) was shown to have an accelerated GDP release rate, mimicking a G protein-coupled receptor catalyzed release state. In the present study, we investigate the role of the equivalent residue in the G5 motif (residue A143) in the prokaryotic membrane protein FeoB from Streptococcus thermophilus, which includes an N-terminal soluble G protein domain. The structure of this domain has previously been determined in the apo and GDP-bound states and in the presence of a transition state analogue, revealing conformational changes in the G5 motif. The A143 residue was mutated to a serine and analyzed with respect to changes in GTPase activity, nucleotide release rate, GDP affinity and structural alterations. We conclude that the identity of the residue at this position in the G5 loop plays a key role in the nucleotide release rate by allowing the correct positioning and hydrogen bonding of the nucleotide base.
TI  - Cut site selection by the two nuclease domains of the Cas9 RNA-guided endonuclease.
AB  - Cas9, the RNA-guided DNA endonuclease from the CRISPR-Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-CRISPR-associated) system, has been adapted for genome editing and gene regulation in multiple model organisms. Here we characterize a Cas9 ortholog from Streptococcus thermophilus LMG18311 (LMG18311 Cas9). In vitro reconstitution of this system confirms that LMG18311 Cas9 together with a trans-activating RNA (tracrRNA) and a CRISPR RNA (crRNA) cleaves double-stranded DNA with a specificity dictated by the sequence of the crRNA. Cleavage requires not only complementarity between crRNA and target but also the presence of a short motif called the PAM. Here we determine the sequence requirements of the PAM for LMG18311 Cas9. We also show that both the efficiency of DNA target cleavage and the location of the cleavage sites vary based on the position of the PAM sequence.
TI  - Genome Sequences of Four Italian Streptococcus thermophilus Strains of Dairy Origin.
AB  - This report describes the genome sequences of four Streptococcus thermophilus strains, namely, TH982, TH985, TH1477, and 1F8CT, isolated from different dairy environments from the Campania and the Veneto regions in Italy. These data are aimed at increasing the genomic information available on this species, which is of paramount importance for the dairy industry.
TI  - Response of S. thermophilus LMD-9 to bacitracin: involvement of a BceRS/AB-like module and of the rhamnose-glucose polysaccharide synthesis pathway.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus is a lactic acid bacterium of major importance to the  dairy industry as it is found in numerous cheeses and is one of the two bacterial species involved in the fermentation of yogurt. Bacterial two-component signal transduction systems (TCSs) play important roles in the process of bacterial environmental adaptation. S. thermophilus LMD-9 possesses eight such TCS systems; however, their functions have thus far been only poorly investigated. Here, we focused on two of the TCSs in LMD-9, TCS06 and TCS07, whose encoding genes are located close to each other on the chromosome, and are associated with those of ABC transporters. TCS06 homologs are frequently found in Lactobacillales, but their function has not yet been determined, while TCS07 and its upstream potential ABC transporter are homologous to the BceRS/AB system, which is involved in bacitracin resistance in Bacillus and Streptococcus species. To investigate the function(s) of TCS06 and TCS07, we constructed and characterized deletion mutants and performed transcriptional analysis in the presence and absence of bacitracin. We show here that both TCS06 and TCS07 regulate the genes in their close vicinity, in particular those encoding ABC transporters. We propose that the response of S. thermophilus to bacitracin includes i) a bacitracin export system, regulated by TCS07 and constituting a BceRS/AB-like detoxification module, and ii) the modification of cell-envelope properties via modulation of rhamnose-glucose polysaccharide synthesis, at least partially regulated by TCS06.
TI  - rBet v 1 immunotherapy of sensitized mice with Streptococcus thermophilus as vehicle and adjuvant.
AB  - Lactobacilli are able to induce upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules in DCs with Th1 cytokines production and increase in Treg activity. This could explain the observed effectiveness of the prolonged administration of lactobacilli in the prevention of allergic disorders in infants and envisage the possible use of bacteria expressing the allergen for the specific immunotherapy of allergic diseases. Hence, we evaluated Streptococcus thermophilus (ST) expressing rBet v 1 as allergen delivery tool and adjuvant factor for immunotherapy in Betv1-sensitized mice. rBet v 1 gene was introduced and expressed in ST (ST[rBet v 1]). BALB/c mice were sensitized with rBet v 1 and then treated with either ST alone, ST[rBet v 1], or the combination of ST and rBet v 1, for 20 days. After 2 aerosol challenges, Treg frequency, in vitro allergen-induced cytokines, rBet v 1-specific IgE and IgG2a, and bronchial histology were made in harvested spleen, sera, and lung. Results were compared with those obtained from not-treated/sensitized mice. ST[rBet v 1] induced immunological and histological changes typical of successful SIT: increased frequency of Tregs and expression of Foxp3; decreased allergen-specific IgE/IgG2a ratio; decrease of in vitro rBet v 1-induced IL-4 from spleen cells; increased allergen-induced IL-10 and IFN-gamma; drop of bronchial eosinophilia. ST and ST+rBet v 1 combination, even though induced a slight increase in the frequency of Tregs and moderate allergen-induced IL-10, were ineffective in reducing bronchial eosinophilia, allergen induced IL-4 and rBet v 1-specific IgE/IgG2a ratio. ST[rBet v 1] has tolerogenic and Th-1 skewing properties and efficiently delivers the allergen to the gut immune-system restraining and readdressing the established specific Th2 response toward the allergen in mice.
TI  - In vivo application and dynamics of lactic acid bacteria for the four-season production of Vastedda-like cheese.
AB  - Twelve lactic acid bacteria (LAB), previously selected in vitro (Gaglio et al., 2014), were evaluated in situ for their potential to act as starter cultures for the continuous four-season production of Vastedda-like cheese, made with raw ewes' milk. The strains belonged to Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and Streptococcus thermophilus. LAB were first inoculated in multiple-strain combinations on the basis of their optimal growth temperatures in three process conditions which differed for milk treatment and medium for strain development: process 1, growth of strains in the optimal synthetic media and pasteurised milk; process 2, growth of strains in whey based medium (WBM) and pasteurised milk; and process 3, growth of strains in WBM and raw milk. The strains that acidified the curds in short time, as shown by a pH drop, were all mesophilic and were then tested in a single inoculum through process 3. Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR analysis applied to the colonies isolated from the highest dilutions of samples confirmed the dominance of the added strains after curd acidification, stretching and storage. After 15days of refrigerated storage, the decrease in pH values showed an activity of the mesophilic strains at low temperatures, but only Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris PON153, Ln. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides PON259 and PON559 increased their number during the 15days at 7 degrees C. A sensory evaluation indicated that the cheeses obtained by applying protocol 3 and by inoculation with lactococci are the most similar to the protected denomination of origin (PDO) cheese and received the best scores by the judges. Thus, the experimental cheeses obtained with raw milk and inoculated with single and multiple combinations of lactococci were subjected to the analysis of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) carried out by a headspace solid phase microextraction (SPME) technique coupled with gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (GC/MS). The dominance of lactococci over thermophilic LAB of raw milk was verified during summer production and, based on the combination of VOC profiles and sensory evaluation of the final cheeses, the multi-strain Lactococcus culture resulted in the most suitable starter preparation for the full-year production of Vastedda-like cheese.
TI  - Influence of different proteolytic strains of Streptococcus thermophilus in co-culture with Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus on the metabolite profile of set-yoghurt.
AB  - Proto-cooperation between Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus is one of the key factors that determine the fermentation process and final quality of yoghurt. In this study, the interaction between different proteolytic strains of S. thermophilus and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus was investigated in terms of microbial growth, acidification and changes in the biochemical composition of milk during set-yoghurt fermentation. A complementary metabolomics approach was applied for global characterization of volatile and non-volatile polar metabolite profiles of yoghurt associated with proteolytic activity of the individual strains in the starter cultures. The results demonstrated that only non-proteolytic S. thermophilus (Prt-) strain performed proto-cooperation with L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. The proto-cooperation resulted in significant higher populations of the two species, faster milk acidification, significant abundance of aroma volatiles and non-volatile metabolites desirable for a good organoleptic quality of yoghurt. Headspace SPME-GC/MS and (1)H NMR resulted in the identification of 35 volatiles and 43 non-volatile polar metabolites, respectively. Furthermore, multivariate statistical analysis allows discriminating set-yoghurts fermented by different types of starter cultures according to their metabolite profiles. Our finding underlines that selection of suitable strain combinations in yoghurt starters is important for achieving the best technological performance regarding the quality of product.
TI  - In situ enrichment of folate by microorganisms in beta-glucan rich oat and barley matrices.
AB  - The objective was to study folate production of yeast strains, bacteria isolated  from oat bran, and selected lactic acid bacteria as well as one propionibacterium in oat and barley based models. Simultaneously, we aimed at sustaining the stability of viscosity, representing the physicochemical state of beta-glucan. Total folate contents were determined microbiologically and vitamers for selected samples by UHPLC. Folate in yeast cells comprised mainly 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and tetrahydrofolate. Folate production by microbes in YPD medium was different to that in cereal fermentations where vitamers included 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate and formylated derivatives. Microbes producing significant amounts of folate without affecting viscosity were Saccharomyces cerevisiae ALKO743 and Candida milleri ABM4949 among yeasts and Pseudomonas sp. ON8 and Janthinobacterium sp. RB4 among bacteria. Net folate production was up to 120 ng/g after 24 h fermentation and could increase during 2-week storage. Glucose addition increased the proportion of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. Streptococcus thermophilus ABM5097, Lactobacillus reuteri, and Propionibacterium sp. ABM5378 produced folate but in lower concentrations. Both endogenous and added microbes contribute to folate enhancement. Selection of microbes with folate producing capability and limited hydrolytic activity will enable the development of products rich in folate and beta-glucan.
TI  - [The influence of symbiotics in multi-organ failure: randomised trial].
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the administration of symbiotic preparations in patients with multi-organ failure (MOF) diminishes the evolution of the failure, the inflammatory response generated, the colonization pattern and the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) infectious illness. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Randomized and controlled trial. All patients with MOF were included. Neutropenia and acute pancreatitis patients were excluded. A symbiotic (Simbiotic Drink) was administered via enteral feeding during the first 7 days. Variables of interest were: Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score evolution, systemic concentrations of lactate, fibrinogen and D-dimer; skin and mucosa colonization and infectious disease register. RESULTS: Eighty-nine patients were included; 46 in the symbiotic group (SG) and 43 in the control group (CG). There were 68.5% males, with a median age of 69 years. There were no significant differences in the patients' fundamental characteristics (medical history, age, reason for admission, severity scores), nor in the length of ICU stay or in mortality. Comparing the SG with the CG, there were lower lactate levels on the second day, more fibrinogen levels on the days 5 and 7, and lower D-dimer levels on the day 7. Eight hundred and ninety-five cultures were performed for colonization assessment, with isolation of 528 microorganisms. No differences in microbiological resistance were found; there were more colonization in the SG by Candida in mucous membranes after the third day; this situation resolved after stopping symbiotic administration. Twenty-two patients suffered an infectious disease in ICU, 14 in SG (42.4%) and 19 in CG (57.6%). Although no differences were found in the microbiological pattern, there was a predominance of Candida spp. over other microorganisms (4 vs. 0 cases). CONCLUSIONS: The symbiotic preparation Simbiotic Drink, administered in MOF, results in differences to improve the early lactate levels and late fibrinogen/D-dimer levels as well as mucosa colonization by Candida. There were no differences in the ICU evolution.
TI  - Genome Sequences of Streptococcus thermophilus Strains MTH17CL396 and M17PTZA496  from Fontina, an Italian PDO Cheese.
AB  - Here is presented the whole-genome sequences of Streptococcus thermophilus strains MTH17CL396 and M17PTZA496, isolated from fontina protected designation of origin (PDO) cheese in the Valle d'Aosta Region (Italy). S. thermophilus is a lactic acid bacterium widely present in dairy products, and these are the first publicly available genome sequences of S. thermophilus strains isolated from cheese.
TI  - Reduction of the off-flavor volatile generated by the yogurt starter culture including Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus in soymilk.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus establish a symbiotic relationship in milk; however, S. thermophilus predominantly grows in soymilk. This study determined that excess diacetyl was notably generated mainly by S. thermophilus in soymilk, and this flavor compound created an unpleasant odor in fermented soymilk. The addition of l-valine to soymilk reduced the amount of diacetyl and increased the levels of acetoin during fermentation by S. thermophilus . In addition, it was found that the expression of the ilvC gene was repressed and that of the als and aldB genes was stimulated in S. thermophilus by l-valine. Sensory evaluations with the triangle difference test and a preference test showed that the soymilk fermented with l-valine was significantly preferred compared with that without l-valine. In this study, we successfully controlled the metabolic flux of S. thermophilus in soymilk and produced more favorable fermented soymilk without the use of genetically modified lactic acid bacteria strains.
TI  - Short communication: survival of the characteristic microbiota in probiotic fermented camel, cow, goat, and sheep milks during refrigerated storage.
AB  - The objective of this study was to monitor the viability during storage of Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5 (A), Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis BB-12 (B), and Streptococcus thermophilus CHCC 742/2130 (T) in probiotic cultured dairy foods made from pasteurized camel, cow, goat, and sheep milks fermented by an ABT-type culture. The products manufactured were stored at 4 degrees C for 42d. Microbiological analyses were performed at weekly intervals. Streptococcus thermophilus CHCC 742/2130 was the most numerous culture component in all 4 products both at the beginning and at the end of storage. The viable counts of streptococci showed no significant decline in fermented camel milk throughout the entire storage period. The initial numbers of Lb. acidophilus LA-5 were over 2 orders of magnitude lower than those of Strep. thermophilus CHCC 742/2130. With the progress of time, a slow and constant decrease was observed in lactobacilli counts; however, the final viability percentages of this organism did not differ significantly in the probiotic fermented milks tested. The cultured dairy foods made from cow, sheep, and goat milks had comparable B. animalis ssp. lactis BB-12 counts on d 0, exceeding by approximately 0.5 log10 cycle those in the camel milk-based product. No significant losses occurred in viability of bifidobacteria in fermented camel, cow, and sheep milks during 6wk of refrigerated storage. In conclusion, all 4 varieties of milk proved to be suitable raw materials for the manufacture of ABT-type fermented dairy products that were microbiologically safe and beneficial for human consumption. It was suggested that milk from small ruminants be increasingly used to produce probiotic fermented dairy foods. The development of camel milk-based probiotic cultured milks appears to be even more promising because new markets could thus be conquered. It must be emphasized, however, that further microbiological and sensory studies, technology development activities, and market research are needed before such food products can be successfully commercialized.
TI  - Current taxonomy of phages infecting lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Phages infecting lactic acid bacteria have been the focus of significant research attention over the past three decades. Through the isolation and characterization of hundreds of phage isolates, it has been possible to classify phages of the dairy starter and adjunct bacteria Lactococus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Leuconostoc spp., and Lactobacillus spp. Among these, phages of L. lactis have been most thoroughly scrutinized and serve as an excellent model system to address issues that arise when attempting taxonomic classification of phages infecting other LAB species. Here, we present an overview of the current taxonomy of phages infecting LAB genera of industrial significance, the methods employed in these taxonomic efforts and how these may be employed for the taxonomy of phages of currently underrepresented and emerging phage species.
TI  - Petit suisse from black soybean: bioactive compounds and antioxidant properties during development process.
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the antioxidant properties, bioactive compounds and  other physico-chemical parameters from black soybean and its derivatives over 30 days under refrigeration at 4 degrees C and develop a probiotic petit suisse produced from black soybean. The soymilk showed the highest levels of isoflavones (109 mg/100 g), total phenolics (600 mg/100 g) and total anthocyanins (388 mg/100 g) with the highest response in the tests with DPPH* and ABTS+* on a dry basis. There was a significant increase (p </= 0.05) in antioxidant activity during storage due to the hydrolysis of isoflavone glycosides to aglycones in soymilk sample, having a strong linear correlation between the concentration of isoflavone aglycones and the antioxidant activity for ABTS+* (R = 0.9437, 0.9624 and 0.9992) and DPPH* (R = 0.9865, 0.9978 and 0.9911), respectively, for soymilk, quark and petit suisse. The conversion of isoflavone was influenced directly by the characteristics of each sample, inhibiting or promoting the action of the enzyme. The petit suisse developed is an alternative for consumers, providing isoflavones and anthocyanins, possessing probiotic average counts (10(8) CFU g(-)(1)) during storage.
TI  - Optimisation of oat milk formulation to obtain fermented derivatives by using probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri microorganisms.
AB  - Functional advantages of probiotics combined with interesting composition of oat  were considered as an alternative to dairy products. In this study, fermentation of oat milk with Lactobacillus reuteri and Streptococcus thermophilus was analysed to develop a new probiotic product. Central composite design with response surface methodology was used to analyse the effect of different factors (glucose, fructose, inulin and starters) on the probiotic population in the product. Optimised formulation was characterised throughout storage time at 4 in terms of pH, acidity, beta-glucan and oligosaccharides contents, colour and rheological behaviour. All formulations studied were adequate to produce fermented foods and minimum dose of each factor was considered as optimum. The selected formulation allowed starters survival above 10(7)/cfu ml to be considered as a functional food and was maintained during the 28 days controlled. beta-glucans remained in the final product with a positive effect on viscosity. Therefore, a new probiotic non-dairy milk was successfully developed in which high probiotic survivals were assured throughout the typical yoghurt-like shelf life.
TI  - Microbial biodiversity in cheese consortia and comparative Listeria growth on surfaces of uncooked pressed cheeses.
AB  - The study set out to determine how changes in the microbial diversity of a complex antilisterial consortium from the surface of St-Nectaire cheese modify its antilisterial activities. On the basis of the microbial composition of a natural complex consortium named TR15 (Truefood consortium 15), three new consortia of different species and strain compositions were defined: TR15-SC (58 isolates from TR15 collection), TR15-M (pools of isolates from selective counting media) and TR15-BHI (pools of isolates from BHI medium). Their antilisterial activities on the surfaces of uncooked pressed cheese made with pasteurised milk were compared with the activity of complex consortium TR15 and a control cheese inoculated only with starter culture (Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii). The natural consortium TR15 was the most inhibitory, followed by reconstituted consortium TR15-BHI. The dynamics of the cheese rind microbial flora were monitored by counting on media and by isolate identification using 16S rDNA sequencing and direct 16S rDNA Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism analysis. The combination of these methods showed that rind with natural consortium TR15 had greater microbial diversity and different microbial dynamics than cheese rinds with reconstituted consortia. Cheese rind with the natural consortium showed higher citrate consumption and the highest concentrations of lactic and acetic acids, connected with high levels of lactic acid bacteria such as Carnobacterium maltaromaticum, Vagococcus fluvialis, Enterococcus gilvus, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Brochothrix thermosphacta and Lactococcus lactis, ripening bacteria such as Arthrobacter nicotianae/arilaitensis, and Gram negative bacteria (Pseudomonas psychrophila and Enterobacter spp.). The highest L. monocytogenes count was on rind with TR15-M and was positively associated with the highest pH value, high succinic and citric acid contents, and the highest levels of Marinilactibacillus psychrotolerans and Gram positive catalase positive bacteria represented by Staphylococcus vitulinus, Brevibacterium linens, Microbacterium gubbeenense and Brachybacterium tyrofermentans. The results show that the species composition of consortium is more important than the number of species. It is likely that inhibition mechanisms differ from one consortium to another; investigating gene expression will be an effective way to elucidate microbial interactions in cheese.
TI  - Animal rennets as sources of dairy lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The microbial composition of artisan and industrial animal rennet pastes was studied by using both culture-dependent and -independent approaches. Pyrosequencing targeting the 16S rRNA gene allowed to identify 361 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) to the genus/species level. Among lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Streptococcus thermophilus and some lactobacilli, mainly Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus reuteri, were the most abundant species, with differences among the samples. Twelve groups of microorganisms were targeted by viable plate counts revealing a dominance of mesophilic cocci. All rennets were able to acidify ultrahigh-temperature-processed (UHT) milk as shown by pH and total titratable acidity (TTA). Presumptive LAB isolated at the highest dilutions of acidified milks were phenotypically characterized, grouped, differentiated at the strain level by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR analysis, and subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Only 18 strains were clearly identified at the species level, as Enterococcus casseliflavus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus lactis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, and Streptococcus thermophilus, while the other strains, all belonging to the genus Enterococcus, could not be allotted into any previously described species. The phylogenetic analysis showed that these strains might represent different unknown species. All strains were evaluated for their dairy technological performances. All isolates produced diacetyl, and 10 of them produced a rapid pH drop in milk, but only 3 isolates were also autolytic. This work showed that animal rennet pastes can be sources of LAB, mainly enterococci, that might contribute to the microbial diversity associated with dairy productions.
TI  - Whole-Genome Sequences of Streptococcus thermophilus Strains TH1435 and TH1436, Isolated from Raw Goat Milk.
AB  - We report the genome sequences of two Streptococcus thermophilus strains, TH1435  and TH1436, isolated from raw goat milk devoted to the production of artisanal cheese in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region in Italy. The genome sequences of these two quickly acidifying strains are the first available genome sequences of S. thermophilus strains isolated in Italy.
TI  - Studies on changes in microstructure and proteolysis in cow and soy milk curd during fermentation using lactic cultures for improving protein bioavailability.
AB  - Cow milk curd was prepared using 2% v/v of Streptococcus thermophilus DG1 and a mixed culture (0.5:1.5 v/v) of S. thermophilus DG1 and Lactobacillus plantarum and incubating at 37 degrees C for 16 h. Soy milk curd was prepared using different ratios of lactic cultures as stated earlier and also a mixed culture containing S. thermophilus DG1, L. plantarum and Leuconostoc mesenteroides sub spp. mesenteroides in the ratio 1:1:1 v/v along with beet pulp (2% w/w) and incubating at 37 degrees C for 18 h. This improved functional and probiotic properties of curd. Structural changes in curd samples during fermentation were observed by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). Soy milk curd showed loosened structure. The degradation of proteins into peptides and amino acids were evaluated by SDS PAGE and amino acid analysis. Maximum production of amino acids i.e. cystine, histidine and asparagine were observed in both the cow and soymilk after fermentation.
TI  - Effect of bacterial cell-free supernatants on infectivity of norovirus surrogates.
AB  - Bacterial metabolic products were evaluated for inhibitory effects on viral propagation in cell culture. Cell-free supernatants (CFS) were prepared from growth of Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 19433, Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 13525, Escherichia coli 08, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Bacillus subtilis 168, Bacillus coagulans 185A, B. coagulans 7050, Clostridium sporogenes PA3679, and a commercial probiotic mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Streptococcus thermophilus in microbiological medium or milk. The inhibitory effects of CFS on the propagation of murine norovirus 1 and Tulane virus in RAW 264.7 and LLCMK2 cells, respectively, were evaluated in the continuous presence of CFS or after exposure of host cells to CFS. Slight inhibition of viral propagation was observed for murine norovirus and Tulane virus in the continuous presence of CFS of B. subtilis 168 and E. faecalis 19433, respectively. CFS cytotoxicity was also determined by microscopic examination. Virus persisted in the CFS that demonstrated cytotoxic effects, suggesting a lack of direct effect of CFS on virions. The viral propagation indicates a general lack of competitive inhibition by bacterial extracellular products and bears significance in understanding the persistence of virus in food and human systems shared by bacteria that are recognized for their colonization and competitive capabilities.
TI  - Development of a selective culture medium for bifidobacteria, Raffinose-Propionate Lithium Mupirocin (RP-MUP) and assessment of its usage with Petrifilm Aerobic Count plates.
AB  - This study aimed to develop a selective culture media to enumerate bifidobacteria in fermented milk and to assess this medium when used with Petrifilm AC plates. For this purpose, Bifidobacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp. and Streptococcus thermophilus strains were tested to verify their fermentation patterns for different carbohydrates. All bifidobacteria strains were able to use raffinose. Based on these characteristic, a selective culture medium was proposed (Raffinose-Propionate Lithium Mupirocin, RP-MUP), used with Petrifilm AC plates, and was used to enumerate bifidobacteria in fermented milk. RP-MUP performance was assessed by comparing the results with this medium to reference protocols and culture media for bifidobacteria enumeration. RP-MUP, whether used or not with Petrifilm AC, presented similar performance to TOS-MUP (ISO 29981), with no significant differences between the mean bifidobacteria counts (p < 0.05) and with high correlation indices (r = 0.99, p < 0.05). As an advantage, reliable results were obtained after just 48 h of incubation when RP-MUP was used with Petrifilm AC, instead of the 72 h described in the ISO 29981 protocol.
TI  - Characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from artisanal Travnik young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks over four seasons.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the composition of lactic acid bacteria  (LAB) in autochthonous young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks produced in the Vlasic mountain region of central Bosnia and Herzegovina near the town of Travnik over a four season period. These three products were made from cow's milk by a traditional method without the addition of a starter culture. Preliminary characterization with phenotype-based assays and identification using rep-PCR with a (GTG)5 primer and 16S rDNA sequence analysis were undertaken for 460 LAB isolates obtained from all the examined samples. Fifteen species were identified as follows: Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus raffinolactis, Lactococcus garviae, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus helveticus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus italicus, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Leuconostoc lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus and Streptococcus mitis. A wide genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity of the species was observed, particularly within the Lc. lactis strains. In all of the tested dairy products across four seasons, a significantly positive correlation (r = 0.690) between the presence of lactococci and enterococci and a negative correlation (r = 0.722) between the presence of lactococci and leuconostocs were recorded. Forty-five percent of the lactobacilli and 54.4% of the lactococci exhibited proteolytic activity, whereas 18.7% of the total LAB isolates exhibited antimicrobial activity.
TI  - [Identification of lactic acid bacteria in commercial yogurt and their antibiotic resistance].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in commercial yogurts and investigate their antibiotic resistance. METHODS: LABs were cultured from 5 yogurt brands and the isolates were identified at the species level by 16S rRNA sequence. Genotyping was performed by repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR (rep-PCR). The sensitivity to 7 antibiotics was tested for all LAB isolates by Kirby-Bauer paper diffusion (K-B method). Meanwhile, 9 antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), including erythromycin resistance genes (ermA and ermB) and tetracycline resistance genes (tetM, tetK, tetS, tetQ, tetO, tetL and tetW), were detected by PCR amplification in the identified LAB isolates. The PCR products were confirmed by sequencing. RESULTS: Total 100 LABs were isolated, including 23 Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, 26 Lactobacillus casei, 30 Streptococcus thermophilus, 5 Lactobacillus acidophilus, 6 Lactobacillus plantarum, and 10 Lactobacillus paracasei. The drug susceptibility test shows that all 100 isolates were resistant to gentamicin and streptomycin, 42 isolates were resistant to vancomycin, and on the contrary all were sensitive to cefalexin, erythromycin, tetracycline and oxytetracycline. Moreover, 5 ARGs were found in the 28 sequencing confirmed isolates, ermB gene was detected in 8 isolates, tet K in 4 isolates, tetL in 2 isolates, tetM in 4 isolates, tetO in 2 isolates. erm A, tet S, tet Q and tet W genes were not detected in the isolates. Antibiotic resistance genes were found in 53.57% (15/28) sequenced isolates, 2 -3 antibiotic resistance genes were detected in 4 isolates of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus. CONCLUSIONS: Some LABs were not labeled in commercial yogurt products. Antibiotic resistance genes tend to be found in the starter culture of L. delbrueckii ssp. Bulgaricus and S. thermophilus. All the LAB isolates were sensitive to erythromycin and tetracycline, even though some carried erythromycin and/or tetracycline resistance genes. We proved again that LAB could carry antibiotic resistance gene(s) though it is sensitive to antibiotics.
TI  - Inactivation of dairy bacteriophages by commercial sanitizers and disinfectants.
AB  - Many commercial sanitizers and disinfectants have been used over the years to control microbial contamination but their efficacy on phages is often unknown. Here, 23 commercial chemical products, including 21 food-grade sanitizers were tested against virulent dairy phages. These food-grade chemicals included oxidizing agents, halogenated agents, alcohols, quaternary ammonium compounds, anionic acids, iodine-based acids, and an amphoteric chemical. Phage P008 was first exposed to each sanitizer for 2 and 15min at room temperature and at two different concentrations, namely the lowest and highest no-rinse sanitizing concentrations. Organic matter (whey or milk) was also added to the testing solutions. At the end of the exposure period, the test solution was neutralized and the number of infectious phages was determined by plaque assays. The five most efficient sanitizers against phage P008 (<4 log of inactivation) were then tested against virulent lactococcal phages P008, CB13, AF6, P1532 of the 936 group, P001 (c2), Q54, and 1358 as well as Lactobacillus plantarum phage B1 and Streptococcus thermophilus phage 2972 using the same protocol. The oxidizing agents and the quaternary ammonium compounds were the most efficient against all phages although phages CB13 and P1532 were less sensitive to these chemicals than the other phages. This study may help in the selection of appropriate chemicals for controlling phage contamination in industrial factories and research laboratories.
TI  - Food environments select microorganisms based on selfish energetic behavior.
AB  - Nutrient richness, and specifically the abundance of mono- and disaccharides that characterize several food matrixes, such as milk and grape juice, has allowed the speciation of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts with a high fermentation capacity instead of energetically favorable respiratory metabolism. In these environmental contexts, rapid sugar consumption and lactic acid or ethanol production, accumulation, and tolerance, together with the ability to propagate in the absence of oxygen, are several of the "winning" traits that have apparently evolved and become specialized to perfection in these fermenting microorganisms. Here, we summarize and discuss the evolutionary context that has driven energetic metabolism in food-associated microorganisms, using the dairy species Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus among prokaryotes and the bakers' yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae among eukaryotes as model organisms.
TI  - Influence of fructooligosaccharides on the fermentation profile and viable counts in a symbiotic low fat milk.
AB  - This study evaluated the effects of prebiotics on fermentation profile and growth of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Bifidobacterium lactis in co-cultures with Streptococcus thermophilus. Acidification rate and viability were positively influenced by the co-culture with B. lactis and by both inulin or oligofructose in low fat milk.
TI  - Microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of May bryndza cheese.
AB  - Diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of May bryndza cheese, a traditional Slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. Quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, E. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and Geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. Diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. The culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese, lactobacilli, lactococci and Geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) CFU/g, 10(9) CFU/g and 10(5) CFU/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. The diversity of bacteria encompassed Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter guillouiae, Acinetobacter sp., Acinetobacter johnsonii, Citrobacter braakii, Clostridium bartlettii, Corynebacterium callunae, Corynebacterium maris, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter asburiae, Enterobacter hormaechei, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus pallens, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus haemolyticus, Hafnia alvei, Kluyvera cryocrescens, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactococcus garvieae, Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, Lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "Leuconostoc garlicum", Mannheimia glucosida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pseudomonas sp., Ps. fluorescens, "Ps. reactans", Raoultella ornithinolytica, R. terrigena, "Rothia arfidiae", Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Staph. felis, Staph. pasteuri, Staph. sciuri, Staph. xylosus, Streptococcus parauberis, Str. thermophilus and Variovorax paradoxus. The diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed Alternaria alternata, "Ascomycete sp.", Aspergillus fumigatus, Beauveria brongniartii, Candida xylopsoci, C. inconspicua, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Debaromyces hansenii, Fomes fomentarius, Galactomyces candidus, Gymnoascus reesii, Chaetomium globosum, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Metarhizium anisopliae, Penicillium aurantiogriseum, P. camemberti, P. freii, P. polonicum, P. viridicatum, Pichia kudriavzevii, Sordaria alcina, Trichosporon lactis and Yarrowia lipolytica.
TI  - Microbiological, physico-chemical, nutritional and sensory characterization of traditional Matsoni: selection and use of autochthonous multiple strain cultures to extend its shelf-life.
AB  - Matsoni, a traditional Georgian fermented milk, has variable quality and stability besides a short shelf-life (72-120 h at 6 degrees C) due to inadequate production and storage conditions. To individuate its typical traits as well as select and exploit autochthonous starter cultures to standardize its overall quality without altering its typicality, we carried out a thorough physico-chemical, sensorial and microbial characterization of traditional Matsoni. A polyphasic approach, including a culture-independent (PCR-DGGE) and two PCR culture-dependent methods, was employed to study the ecology of Matsoni. Overall, the microbial ecosystem of Matsoni resulted largely dominated by Streptococcus (S.) thermophilus and Lactobacillus (Lb.) delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. High loads of other lactic acid bacteria species, including Lb. helveticus, Lb. paracasei and Leuconostoc (Leuc.) lactis were found to occur as well. A selected autochthonous multiple strain culture (AMSC) composed of one Lb. bulgaricus, one Lb. paracasei and one S. thermophilus strain, applied for the pilot-scale production of traditional Matsoni, resulted the best in terms of enhanced shelf-life (one month), sensorial and nutritional quality without altering its overall typical quality. This AMSC is at disposal of SMEs who need to exploit and standardize the overall quality of this traditional fermented milk, preserving its typicality.
TI  - Development of the recombinase-based in vivo expression technology in Streptococcus thermophilus and validation using the lactose operon promoter.
AB  - AIMS: To construct and validate the recombinase-based in vivo expression technology (R-IVET) tool in Streptococcus thermophilus (ST). METHODS AND RESULTS: The R-IVET system we constructed in the LMD-9 strain includes the plasmid pULNcreB allowing transcriptional fusion with the gene of the site-specific recombinase Cre and the chromosomal cassette containing a spectinomycin resistance gene flanked by two loxP sites. When tested in M17 medium, promoters of the genes encoding the protease PrtS, the heat-shock protein Hsp16 and of the lactose operon triggered deletion of the cassette, indicating promoter activity in these conditions. The lactose operon promoter was also found to be activated during the transit in the murine gastrointestinal tract. CONCLUSIONS: The R-IVET system developed in ST is relatively stable, functional, very sensitive and can be used to assay activity of promoters, which are specifically active in in vivo conditions. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This first adaptation of R-IVET to ST provides a highly valuable tool allowing an exploration of the physiological state of ST in the GIT of mammals, fermentation processes or dairy products.
TI  - Adaptation of the Haloarcula hispanica CRISPR-Cas system to a purified virus strictly requires a priming process.
AB  - The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas system  mediates adaptive immunity against foreign nucleic acids in prokaryotes. However, efficient adaptation of a native CRISPR to purified viruses has only been observed for the type II-A system from a Streptococcus thermophilus industry strain, and rarely reported for laboratory strains. Here, we provide a second native system showing efficient adaptation. Infected by a newly isolated virus HHPV-2, Haloarcula hispanica type I-B CRISPR system acquired spacers discriminatively from viral sequences. Unexpectedly, in addition to Cas1, Cas2 and Cas4, this process also requires Cas3 and at least partial Cascade proteins, which are involved in interference and/or CRISPR RNA maturation. Intriguingly, a preexisting spacer partially matching a viral sequence is also required, and spacer acquisition from upstream and downstream sequences of its target sequence (i.e. priming protospacer) shows different strand bias. These evidences strongly indicate that adaptation in this system strictly requires a priming process. This requirement, if validated also true for other CRISPR systems as implied by our bioinformatic analysis, may help to explain failures to observe efficient adaptation to purified viruses in many laboratory strains, and the discrimination mechanism at the adaptation level that has confused scientists for years.
TI  - Programmable DNA cleavage in vitro by Cas9.
AB  - The ternary Cas9-crRNA-tracrRNA complex (Cas9t) of the Type II CRISPR (clustered  regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-Cas (CRISPR-associated) system functions as an Mg2+-dependent RNA-directed DNA endonuclease that locates its DNA target guided by the crRNA (CRISPR RNA) in the tracrRNA-crRNA structure and introduces a double-strand break at a specific site in DNA. The simple modular organization of Cas9t, where specificity for the DNA target is encoded by a small crRNA and the cleavage reaction is executed by the Cas9 endonuclease, provides a versatile platform for the engineering of universal RNA-directed DNA endonucleases. By altering the crRNA sequence within the Cas9t complex, programmable endonucleases can be designed for both in vitro and in vivo applications. Cas9t has been recently employed as a gene-editing tool in various eukaryotic cell types. Using Streptococcus thermophilus Cas9t as a model system, we demonstrate the feasibility of Cas9t as a programmable molecular tool for in vitro DNA manipulations.
TI  - Genomic impact of CRISPR immunization against bacteriophages.
AB  - CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) together with  CAS (RISPR-associated) genes form the CRISPR-Cas immune system, which provides sequence-specific adaptive immunity against foreign genetic elements in bacteria and archaea. Immunity is acquired by the integration of short stretches of invasive DNA as novel 'spacers' into CRISPR loci. Subsequently, these immune markers are transcribed and generate small non-coding interfering RNAs that specifically guide nucleases for sequence-specific cleavage of complementary sequences. Among the four CRISPR-Cas systems present in Streptococcus thermophilus, CRISPR1 and CRISPR3 have the ability to readily acquire new spacers following bacteriophage or plasmid exposure. In order to investigate the impact of building CRISPR-encoded immunity on the host chromosome, we determined the genome sequence of a BIM (bacteriophage-insensitive mutant) derived from the DGCC7710 model organism, after four consecutive rounds of bacteriophage challenge. As expected, active CRISPR loci evolved via polarized addition of several novel spacers following exposure to bacteriophages. Although analysis of the draft genome sequence revealed a variety of SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) and INDELs (insertions/deletions), most of the in silico differences were not validated by Sanger re-sequencing. In addition, two SNPs and two small INDELs were identified and tracked in the intermediate variants. Overall, building CRISPR-encoded immunity does not significantly affect the genome, which allows the maintenance of important functional properties in isogenic CRISPR mutants. This is critical for the development and formulation of sustainable and robust next-generation starter cultures with increased industrial lifespans.
TI  - Evaluation of probiotic survivability in yogurt exposed to cold chain interruption.
AB  - In this research, the survival of probiotic microorganisms in yogurts stored at room temperature (cold chain interruption conditions) was studied. Milk inoculated with yogurt bacteria (mixed culture of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus) and a single probiotic culture (L. acidophilus LA-5 or Bifidobacterium lactis Bb- 12 or L. rhamnosus HN001 or L. paracasei Lpc-37) were incubated till pH of 4.5 was reached. Probiotic yogurts were stored at two different temperatures including cold (control) and room temperatures (5 and 20 degrees C, respectively). Changes in pH decrease, titratable acidity increase and redox potential increase as well as the viability of probiotics per 6 h intervals during an assumptive interrupted cold storage (24 h) were monitored. The survival of probiotics was strongly dependent on the storage temperature and remarkable viability loss occurred in room temperature compared to refrigerated storage. In addition, the survivability was dependent on probiotic strain. Among our experimental strains, B. lactis Bb-12 showed the less resistance to be stored at 20 degrees C (24 h) and referring to the recommended minimum numbers of 10(7) cfu mL(-) (1), L. rhamnosus HN001 was the most suitable probiotic strain to be used in probiotic yogurts especially in countries having high possibility of cold chain interruption during storage.
TI  - Probiotic effects on late-onset sepsis in very preterm infants: a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Late-onset sepsis frequently complicates prematurity, contributing to morbidity and mortality. Probiotics may reduce mortality and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in preterm infants, with unclear effect on late-onset sepsis. This study aimed to determine the effect of administering a specific combination of probiotics to very preterm infants on culture-proven late-onset sepsis. METHODS: A prospective multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized trial compared daily administration of a probiotic combination (Bifidobacterium infantis, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Bifidobacterium lactis, containing 1 x 10(9) total organisms) with placebo (maltodextrin) in infants born before 32 completed weeks' gestation weighing <1500 g. The primary outcome was at least 1 episode of definite late-onset sepsis. RESULTS: Between October 2007 and November 2011, 1099 very preterm infants from Australia and New Zealand were randomized. Rates of definite late-onset sepsis (16.2%), NEC of Bell stage 2 or more (4.4%), and mortality (5.1%) were low in controls, with high breast milk feeding rates (96.9%). No significant difference in definite late-onset sepsis or all-cause mortality was found, but this probiotic combination reduced NEC of Bell stage 2 or more (2.0% versus 4.4%; relative risk 0.46, 95% confidence interval 0.23 to 0.93, P = .03; number needed to treat 43, 95% confidence interval 23 to 333). CONCLUSIONS: The probiotics B infantis, S thermophilus, and B lactis significantly reduced NEC of Bell stage 2 or more in very preterm infants, but not definite late-onset sepsis or mortality. Treatment with this combination of probiotics appears to be safe.
TI  - Genetically engineered immunomodulatory Streptococcus thermophilus strains producing antioxidant enzymes exhibit enhanced anti-inflammatory activities.
AB  - The aims of this study were to develop strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) having both immunomodulatory and antioxidant properties and to evaluate their anti-inflammatory effects both in vitro, in different cellular models, and in vivo, in a mouse model of colitis. Different Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus strains were cocultured with primary cultures of mononuclear cells. Analysis of the pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines secreted by these cells after coincubation with candidate bacteria revealed that L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CRL 864 and S. thermophilus CRL 807 display the highest anti-inflammatory profiles in vitro. Moreover, these results were confirmed in vivo by the determination of the cytokine profiles in large intestine samples of mice fed with these strains. S. thermophilus CRL 807 was then transformed with two different plasmids harboring the genes encoding catalase (CAT) or superoxide dismutase (SOD) antioxidant enzymes, and the anti-inflammatory effects of recombinant streptococci were evaluated in a mouse model of colitis induced by trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS). Our results showed a decrease in weight loss, lower liver microbial translocation, lower macroscopic and microscopic damage scores, and modulation of the cytokine production in the large intestines of mice treated with either CAT- or SOD-producing streptococci compared to those in mice treated with the wild-type strain or control mice without any treatment. Furthermore, the greatest anti-inflammatory activity was observed in mice receiving a mixture of both CAT- and SOD-producing streptococci. The addition of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CRL 864 to this mixture did not improve their beneficial effects. These findings show that genetically engineering a candidate bacterium (e.g., S. thermophilus CRL 807) with intrinsic immunomodulatory properties by introducing a gene expressing an antioxidant enzyme enhances its anti-inflammatory activities.
TI  - Use of microparticulated whey protein concentrate, exopolysaccharide-producing Streptococcus thermophilus, and adjunct cultures for making low-fat Italian Caciotta-type cheese.
AB  - Low-fat Caciotta-type cheeses were manufactured with partially skim milk (fat content of ~0.3%) alone (LFC); with the supplementation of 0.5% (wt/vol) microparticulated whey protein concentrate (MWPC) (LFC-MWPC); with MWPC and exopolysaccharides (EPS)-producing Streptococcus thermophilus ST446 (LFC-MWPC-EPS); and with MWPC, EPS-producing strain ST446, and Lactobacillus plantarum LP and Lactobacillus rhamnosus LRA as adjunct cultures (LFC-MWPC-EPS-A). The non-EPS-producing isogenic variant Streptococcus thermophilus ST042 was used for making full-fat Caciotta-type cheese (FFC), LFC, and LFC-MWPC. Cheeses were characterized based on compositional, microbiological, biochemical, texture, volatile components (purge and trap, and solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry), and sensory analyses. Compared with FFC and LFC (51.6 +/- 0.7 to 53.0 +/- 0.9%), the other cheese variants retained higher levels of moisture (60.5 +/- 1.1 to 67.5 +/- 0.5%). The MWPC mainly contributed to moisture retention. Overall, all LFC had approximately one-fourth (22.6 +/- 0.8%) of the fat of FFC. Hardness of cheeses slightly varied over 7d of ripening. Microbial EPS positively affected cheese texture, and the texture of LFC without MWPC or microbial EPS was excessively firm. Free amino acids were at the highest levels in LFC treatments (2,705.8 +/- 122 to 3,070.4 +/- 123 mg/kg) due to the addition of MWPC and the peptidase activity of adjunct cultures. Aldehydes, alcohols, ketones, sulfur compounds, and short- to medium-chain carboxylic acids differentiated LFC variants and FFC. The sensory attributes pleasant to taste, intensity of flavor, overall acceptability, and pleasant to chew variously described LFC-MWPC-EPS and LFC-MWPC-EPS-A. Based on the technology options used, low-fat Caciotta-type cheese (especially ripened for 14 d) has promising features to be further exploited as a suitable alternative to the full-fat variant.
TI  - Viability of probiotic Lactobacillus casei in yoghurt: defining the best processing step to its addition.
AB  - Probiotics are live microorganisms capable of producing beneficial effects on its host when consumed in adequate amounts. To exert these effects, foods must contain probiotic microorganisms in populations above 10(6) CFU/g or mL throughout its shelf life. One of the strategies to ensure high population of probiotics in fermented milk is to add them during or after the fermentation process separately from the starter cultures. The objective of this study was to investigate the behavior of the probiotic microorganism Lactobacillus casei added to yoghurt in different stages of production. Yoghurts with L. casei were produced at different stages: before addition of starter (Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), added together with this culture and at the end of fermentation. Yoghurt without probiotic added was produced as a control. The products were stored at 4 degrees C and analyzed after 1, 7, 14 and 21 days of storage. In these periods, the populations ofprobiotic and starter cultures were enumerated and the parameters pH and acidity were analyzed. The results were evaluated using analysis of variance and Tukey's test, both at 5% significance level. L. casei remained viable in populations of more than 10(8) CFU / g during 21 days of storage, which is suitable to define the formulations as probiotics. When the different stages of the addition of probiotics in yoghurts were evaluated there was no statistical difference between the formulations (p < 0.05) for populations of L. casei except for the first day of storage.
TI  - The protective effect of VSL#3 on intestinal permeability in a rat model of alcoholic intestinal injury.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of the probiotic VSL#3  in acute alcoholic intestinal injury, and evaluate the effect of VSL#3, glutamine,VSL#3+glutamine and heat-killed VSL#3 therapy in a rat model. METHODS: Six- to eight-week-old male wild-type rats were divided into seven groups. To establish the acute alcohol liver disease model, rats received three doses of corn starch dissolved in PBS/40% alcohol administered intra-gastrically every 12 hours. Treatment groups received an intra-gastric dose of VSL#3, Glutamine, heat-killed VSL#3, or VSL#3+Glutamine 30 minutes prior to alcohol administration. The placebo group was treated with PBS prior to alcohol administration. TNFalpha and endotoxin in plasma was measured by ELISA and Tachypleus Ameboctye Lysate assays, and electron microscopy, Western blotting, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were used to identify the mechanisms of VSL#3 in the regulation of epithelial permeability. RESULTS: First, compared with control group, endotoxin and TNFalpha in alcohol group was obviously high. At the same time, in VSL#3 group,the expression of endotoxin and TNFalpha obviously lower than the alcohol group. And the trends of the expression of tight junction proteins in these groups were reversed with the change of endotoxin and TNFalpha. Second, compared the groups of VSL#3 with glutamine,VSL#3+glutamine and heat-killed VSL#3,we found that both VSL#3 and heat-killed VSL#3, glutamine were as effective as VSL#3+glutamine in the treatment of acute alcohol liver disease, the expression of endotoxin and TNFalpha were lower than the alcohol group, and tight junction proteins were higher than the alcohol group whereas the expression of tight junction proteins were higher in VSL#3 + glutamine group than either agent alone, but have no significant difference. CONCLUSION: We conclude that VSL#3 treatment can regulate the ecological balance of the gut microflora, preventing passage of endotoxin and other bacterial products from the gut lumen into the portal circulation and down-regulating the expression of TNFalpha, which could otherwise down-regulate the expression of tight junction proteins and increase epithelial permeability.
TI  - Prevalence and comparison of Streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius and Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus in raw and fermented dairy products from East and West Africa.
AB  - Streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius (Sii) and Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus are members of the Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex (SBSEC) associated with human infections. SBSEC-related endocarditis was furthermore associated with rural residency in Southern Europe. SBSEC members are increasingly isolated as predominant species from fermented dairy products in Europe, Asia and Africa. African variants of Sii displayed dairy adaptations to lactose metabolism paralleling those of Streptococcus thermophilus including genome decay. In this study, the aim was to assess the prevalence of Sii and possibly other SBSEC members in dairy products of East and West Africa in order to identify their habitat, estimate their importance in dairy fermentation processes and determine geographic areas affected by this potential health risk. Presumptive SBSEC members were isolated on semi-selective M17 and SM agar media. Subsequent genotypic identification of isolates was based on rep-PCR fingerprinting and SBSEC-specific16S rRNA gene PCR assay. Detailed identification was achieved through application of novel primers enhancing the binding stringency in partial groES/groEL gene amplification and subsequent DNA sequencing. The presence of S. thermophilus-like lacS and lacZ genes in the SBSEC isolates was determined to elucidate the prevalence of this dairy adaptation. Isolates (n = 754) were obtained from 72 raw and 95 fermented milk samples from Cote d'Ivoire and Kenya on semi-selective agar media. Colonies of Sii were not detected from raw milk despite high microbial titers of approximately 10(6)CFU/mL on M17 agar medium. However, after spontaneous milk fermentation Sii was genotypically identified in 94.1% of Kenyan samples and 60.8% of Kenyan isolates. Sii prevalence in Cote d'Ivoire displayed seasonal variations in samples from 32.3% (June) to 40.0% (Dec/Jan) and isolates from 20.5% (June) to 27.7% (Dec/Jan) present at titers of 10(6)-10(8)CFU/mL. lacS and lacZ genes were detected in all Kenyan and 25.8% (June) to 65.4% (Dec/Jan) of Ivorian Sii isolates. Regional differences in prevalence of Sii and dairy adaptations were observed, but no clear effect of dairy animal, fermentation procedure and climate was revealed. Conclusively, the high prevalence of Sii in Kenya, Cote d'Ivoire in addition to Somalia, Sudan and Mali strongly indicates a pivotal role of Sii in traditional African dairy fermentations potentially paralleling that of typical western dairy species S. thermophilus. Putative health risks associated with the consumption of high amounts of live Sii and potential different degrees of evolutionary adaptation or ecological colonization require further epidemiologic and genomic investigations, particularly in Africa.
TI  - Influence of casein hydrolysates on exopolysaccharide synthesis by Streptococcus  thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A lot of interesting research has been undertaken to enhance the yield of exopolysaccharides (EPS) produced by lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The objective of this study was to determine the influence of casein hydrolysates (CH) with molecular weight less than 3 kDa on cell viability, EPS synthesis and the enzyme activity involved in EPS synthesis during the co-culturing of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus in MRS broth for 72 h at 37 +/- 0.1 degrees C. RESULTS: The highest EPS yield (150.1 mg L(-)(1)) was obtained on CH prepared with papain (CHP) at 48 h. At 24 h, EPS were composed of galactose, glucose and rhamnose in a molar ratio of 1.0:2.4:1.5. The monosaccharide composition changed with extension of the fermentation time. The activities of alpha-phosphoglucomutase, uridine 5'-diphosphate (UDP)-glucose pyrophosphorylase and UDP-galactose 4-epimerase were associated with EPS synthesis. Moreover, the activities of beta-phosphoglucomutase and deoxythymadine 5'-diphosphate (dTDP)-glucose pyrophosphorylase involved in rhamnose synthesis were very low at the exponential growth phase and could not be detected during other given periods. CONCLUSION: The influence of different CH (<3 kDa) on LAB viability, EPS production, EPS monomeric composition and activity levels of key metabolic enzymes was distinct. Besides, their influence was related to the distribution of amino acids.
TI  - Genetic engineering techniques for lactic acid bacteria: construction of a stable shuttle vector and expression vector for beta-glucuronidase.
AB  - The shuttle vector, pUL6erm, was constructed by using a replicon from pL2, a multiple cloning site, colE1 ori, the ori of Gram-negative bacteria from vector pUC19, and the erythromycin resistance gene from pVA838 as a selection marker. pUL6erm could be transformed easily and maintained stably in Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus casei. Transformation assays of pUL6erm indicated that it had a narrow host range. beta-Glucuronidase was induced in the presence of 0.3 M NaCl and 50 mM glutamate and expressed at 2.4 U mg(-1) with the expression vector (pUL6erm-gadR-GUS) constructed based on pUL6erm carrying beta-glucuronidase gene wuth a chloride-inducible (gadR) expression cassette using Pgad as promoter. Therefore, pUL6erm and pUL6erm-gadR-GUS might be a safe and useful genetic tool for the improvement of lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Hydrolysis of milk-derived bioactive peptides by cell-associated extracellular peptidases of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The trend to confer new functional properties to fermented dairy products by supplementation with bioactive peptides is growing in order to encounter the challenge of health-promoting foods. But these functional ingredients have not to be hydrolysed by proteases of bacteria used in the manufacture of these products. One of the two yoghurt bacteria, Streptococcus thermophilus, has long been considered as weakly proteolytic since its only cell wall-associated subtilisin-like protease, called PrtS, is not always present. Nevertheless, a recent study pointed out a possible peptidase activity in certain strains. In this present study, the stability of milk-derived bioactive peptides, e.g. the anxiolytic peptide, alphas1-CN-(f91-97), in the presence of two different S. thermophilus strains with PrtS+ or PrtS- phenotype was studied. Both strains appeared to be capable of hydrolysing the alphas1-CN-(f91-97) and other bioactive peptides by recurrent removal of N-terminal residues. The hydrolysis was neither due to intracellular peptidases nor to HtrA protease. Results obtained showed that the observed activity originates from the presence at the surface of both strains of an extracellular aminopeptidase activity. Moreover, a cell wall-associated X-prolyl dipeptidyl peptidase activity was also highlighted when beta-casomorphin-7 was used as substrate. All of these findings suggest that, in order to use fermented milks as vector of bioactive peptides, the stability of these bioactive peptides in this kind of products implies to carefully characterize the potential action of the surface proteolytic enzymes of S. thermophilus.
TI  - Mono-dimensional blue native-PAGE and bi-dimensional blue native/urea-PAGE or/SDS-PAGE combined with nLC-ESI-LIT-MS/MS unveil membrane protein heteromeric and homomeric complexes in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Protein interactions are essential elements for the biological machineries underlying biochemical and physiological mechanisms indispensable for microorganism life. By using mono-dimensional blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (1D-BN-PAGE), two-dimensional blue native/urea-PAGE (2D-BN/urea-PAGE) and two-dimensional blue native/SDS-PAGE (2D-BN/SDS-PAGE), membrane protein complexes of Streptococcus thermophilus were resolved and visualized. Protein complex and oligomer constituents were then identified by nLC-ESI-LIT-MS/MS. In total, 65 heteromeric and 30 homomeric complexes were observed, which were then associated with 110 non-redundant bacterial proteins. Protein machineries involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis, molecular uptake, energy metabolism, cell division, protein secretion, folding and chaperone activities were highly represented in electrophoretic profiles; a number of homomeric moonlighting proteins were also identified. Information on hypothetical proteins was also derived. Parallel genome sequencing unveiled that the genes coding for the enzymes involved in exopolysaccharide biosynthesis derive from two separate clusters, generally showing high variability between bacterial strains, which contribute to a unique, synchronized and active synthetic module. The approach reported here paves the way for a further functional characterization of these protein complexes and will facilitate future studies on their assembly and composition during various growth conditions and in different mutant backgrounds, with important consequences for biotechnological applications of this bacterium in dairy productions. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Combined proteomic procedures have been applied to the characterization of heteromultimeric and homomeric protein complexes from the membrane fraction of S. thermophilus. Protein machineries involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis, molecular uptake, energy metabolism, cell division, protein secretion, folding and chaperone activities were identified; information on hypothetical and moonlighting proteins were also derived. This study is original in the lactic bacteria context and may be considered as preliminary to a deeper functional characterization of the corresponding protein complexes. Due to the large use of S. thermophilus as a starter for dairy productions, the data reported here may facilitate future investigations on protein complex assembly and composition under different experimental conditions or for bacterial strains having specific biotechnological applications.
TI  - Concentration dependent effects of dextran on the physical properties of acid milk gels.
AB  - The effect of dextran from Leuconostoc mesenteroides (DEX500), added to milk prior to acidification with glucono-delta-lactone (GDL) or Streptococcus thermophilus DSM20259, was studied with respect to polysaccharide concentration. The incorporation of 5-30 g/kg DEX500 significantly affected gelation behavior. Increasing DEX500 concentrations resulted in a linear increase of gel stiffness (GDL gels: R(2)=0.96; microbial acidification: R(2)=0.94; P<0.05) and 30 g/kg DEX500 resulted in a 2-fold higher stiffness compared to gels without polysaccharide. The respective stirred gels depicted a significant reduction in syneresis, which decreased from 30.4% (0 g/kg DEX500) to 22.0% (30 g/kg DEX500) for chemically acidified gels after 1 d of storage. Physical characteristics of DEX500 in aqueous solution were helpful to explain its behavior in the complex system milk.
TI  - Effect of prebiotic carbohydrates on growth, bile survival and cholesterol uptake abilities of dairy-related bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Three strains of lactic acid bacteria and one probiotic Bifidobacterium strain sourced from milk origin were considered to select for the best synbiotic-like combination for cholesterol uptake ability. For that purpose, fermentative characteristics, bile salt hydrolase activity, bile survival and cholesterol removal were assessed in the presence of different carbohydrates. RESULTS: Carbohydrate fermentability was highly variable among the different strains, and lactulose was the only prebiotic to favour growth of all strains, whereas pectin led to low population regardless of the strain. Bile survival of bacteria could be improved by the preferred carbon source and was related to their bile salt hydrolase activities. All together, our results showed that the most advantageous synbiotic-like combinations to achieve cholesterol uptake abilities were Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus LB 340 with raffinose, Streptococcus thermophilus TA040 or Lactobacillus rhamnosus LBRE-LSAS with lactulose, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bb12 with mannitol. CONCLUSION: The suggested synbiotics may represent new promising functional dairy additives.
TI  - [Particular behavior of different Lactobacillus acidophilus strains in petit-suisse cheese].
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the physico-chemical and microbiological characteristics of petit-suisse cheeses manufactured with the addition of two Lactobacillus acidophilus strains: LA-14 (potentially probiotic) and La-5 (probiotic culture), using Streptococcus thermophilus TA040 as starter culture. Three cheese-making trials were prepared: Q1 (control: with TA040), Q2 (with TA040 + LA-14), and Q3 (with TA040 + La-5). Parameters analyzed included microbial counts of probiotic, potentially probiotic and starter microorganisms, and physico-chemical parameters (pH and moisture) after 1, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days of storage of the product at 4 +/- 1 degree C. Viable counts of L. acidophilus remained between 7.46 and 7.62 log CFU g(-1) for La-5, and between 6.39 and 6.83 log CFU g(-1) for LA-14. As for the starter, higher populations were observed for Q2 (9.58-9.68 log CFU g(-1)) and Q3 (9.42-9.79 log CFU g(-1)), when compared to Q1, which suggests synergism between L. acidophilus and the starter culture. Moisture and pH values remained stable for cheeses Q1, Q2, and Q3, and no significant differences were detected between cheeses after the first day of storage (p > 0.05). Particular features of both L. acidophilus strains determined different behavior in petit-suisse cheese, and the better adaptation of the La-5 to the product environment was perceptible, since higher populations were observed when compared to LA-14.
TI  - Utilization of major fucosylated and sialylated human milk oligosaccharides by isolated human gut microbes.
AB  - Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOS) are not digested in the proximal intestine. In distal intestine, HMOS collectively modify the microbiota, but the response of individual bacteria to individual components of the HMOS is not well defined. Here, each of 25 major isolates of the human intestinal microbiota was fed individual major fucosylated and sialylated HMOS in anaerobic culture. This allowed for an assessment of the influence of specific HMOS on the growth and metabolic products of individual microbiota bacteria. Most Bifidobacteria spp. and Bacteroides spp. grew, induced alpha-L-fucosidase activity, and produced abundant lactate or short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) when fed 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-FL), 3-FL, and lactodifucotetraose (LDFT). Lactobacillus delbrueckii ATCC7830, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC19433, and Streptococcus thermophilus ATCC19258 exhibited slight growth, pH reduction, and lactate production when supplemented with 2'-FL or 3-FL, but not LDFT. Supplementation with 3'-sialyllactose (3'-SL) and 6'-SL promoted moderate growth of Bifidobacterium longum JCM7007, 7009, 7010, 7011, 1272, 11347, ATCC15708, Bacteroides vulgatus ATCC8482, and B. thetaiotaomicron ATCC29148; accordingly, these bacteria exhibited greater neuraminidase activity and produced copious lactate, SCFA, or both. Lactobacillus delbrueckii ATCC7830 also consumed 6'-SL. In contrast, Clostridium spp., L. rhamnosus ATCC53103, E. faecalis ATCC29200, Staphylococcus spp., Enterobacter spp., and Escherichia coli K12 did not consume milk oligosaccharides nor produce appreciable acidic fermentation products. Specific Bifidobacteria and Bacteroides differentially digest specific individual HMOS, with the major fucosylated milk oligosaccharides most strongly stimulating key species of mutualist symbionts. This suggests strategies for treating dysbiosis of the microbiota and associated inflammatory disorders.
TI  - Characterization of Carnobacterium maltaromaticum LMA 28 for its positive technological role in soft cheese making.
AB  - Carnobacterium maltaromaticum is a lactic acid bacterium isolated from soft cheese. The objective of this work was to study its potential positive impact when used in cheese technology. Phenotypic and genotypic characterization of six strains of C. maltaromaticum showed that they belong to different phylogenetic groups. Although these strains lacked the ability to coagulate milk quickly, they were acidotolerant. They did not affect the coagulation capacity of starter lactic acid bacteria, Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus, used in dairy industry. The impact of C. maltaromaticum LMA 28 on bacterial flora of cheese revealed a significant decrease of Psychrobacter sp. concentration, which might be responsible for cheese aging phenomena. An experimental plan was carried out to unravel the mechanism of inhibition of Psychrobacter sp. and Listeria monocytogenes and possible interaction between various factors (cell concentration, NaCl, pH and incubation time). Cellular concentration of C. maltaromaticum LMA 28 was found to be the main factor involved in the inhibition of Psychrobacter sp. and L. monocytogenes.
TI  - Effects of polysaccharide isolated from Streptococcus thermophilus CRL1190 on human gastric epithelial cells.
AB  - EPS1190 was isolated from skim milk fermented with Stretococcus thermophilus CRL1190. The polysaccharide consisted of 33% glucose and 66% galactose with 1,4- and 1,4,6-galactose residues as main building blocks beside a high amount of 1,4-linked glucose. The polymer was characterized additionally concerning viscosity and zeta potential. EPS1190 stimulated cellular vitality and proliferation of human stomach AGS cells and human buccal KB cells significantly. EPS1190 stimulated phagocytosis rate of murine macrophages RAW264.7 significantly. NO-release or anti-inflammatory effects by inhibition of LPS-induced NO release were not observed. Confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that EPS1190 is partially internalized into AGS cells via endosomes. The bioadhesive absorption of FITC-labeled EPS1190 into the mucus layer on the apical side of the epithelium using histological tissue sections from human stomach was observed. Specific interaction of EPS1190 with mucin can be excluded as shown by microviscosimetry studies. EPS1190 increased the adhesion of H. pylori to AGS cells, which resulted in increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines TNFa, IL-6 and IL-8. Summarizing, EPS1190 seems to stimulate epithelial cell regeneration and immunological innate defense mechanisms, which again can rationalized the use of this polysaccharide as cytoprotective compound in probiotioc preparations.

TI  - Probiotic use and prevalence of candidemia and candiduria in a PICU.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the prevalence of candidemia and candiduria before and after the introduction of routine use of probiotics in children who received broad-spectrum antibiotics in a PICU. DESIGN: Retrospective "before and after" study. SETTING: A 12-bed PICU of a teaching hospital in India. PATIENTS: Children 3 months to 12 years old, admitted to the PICU over two 9 months' time periods, who received broad-spectrum antibiotics for more than 48 hours. INTERVENTIONS: Three hundred forty-four patients enrolled between November 2008 and July 2009 after the introduction of routine use of probiotics served as the "probiotic group"; they had received one sachet twice a day of a probiotic mix (EUGI [Wallace Pharma, Goa, India] containing Lactobacillus acidophillus, Lactobacillus rhamnosum, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Saccharomyces boulardii, and Streptococcus thermophilus) for 7 days. Three hundred seventy-six children enrolled between February 2007 and October 2007 served as "controls." Blood was sent for bacterial and fungal cultures if clinically indicated and urine catheter/bag specimen was submitted for bacterial and fungal culture twice a week as per unit's protocol. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Primary outcome was growth of Candida in blood (candidemia), and secondary outcomes were growth of Candida in urine (candiduria), nosocomial bloodstream infections, and urinary tract infections. Data were retrieved from the case records. Candidemia was seen in four of 344 patients (1.2%) in the probiotic group and in 14 of 376 (3.7%) in the control group (relative risk, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.10-0.94; p = 0.03). Candiduria was noted in 37 of 344 patients (10.7%) in the probiotic group and 83 of 376 (22%) in the control group (relative risk, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.34-0.7; p = 0.0001). The prevalence of nosocomial bloodstream infection and urinary tract infection in the probiotic and control groups was 20.3% and 26% (p = 0.07) and 14.2% and 19.1% (p = 0.08), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Routine use of a mix of probiotics in patients who receive broad-spectrum antibiotics could be a useful strategy to reduce the prevalence of candidemia and candiduria in the PICU.
TI  - The thioredoxin system in the dental caries pathogen Streptococcus mutans and the food-industry bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The Streptococcus genus includes the pathogenic species Streptococcus mutans, the main responsible of dental caries, and the safe microorganism Streptococcus thermophilus, used for the manufacture of dairy products. These facultative anaerobes control the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and indeed, both S. mutans and S. thermophilus possess a cambialistic superoxide dismutase, the key enzyme for a preventive action against ROS. To evaluate the properties of a crucial mechanism for repairing ROS damages, the molecular and functional characterization of the thioredoxin system in these streptococci was investigated. The putative genes encoding its protein components in S. mutans and S. thermophilus were analysed and the corresponding recombinant proteins were purified. A single thioredoxin reductase was obtained from either S. mutans (SmTrxB) or S. thermophilus (StTrxB1), whereas two thioredoxins were prepared from either S. mutans (SmTrxA and SmTrxH1) or S. thermophilus (StTrxA1 and StTrxA2). Both SmTrxB and StTrxB1 reduced the synthetic substrate DTNB in the presence of NADPH, whereas only SmTrxA and StTrxA1 accelerated the insulin reduction in the presence of DTT. To reconstitute an in vitro streptococcal thioredoxin system, the combined activity of the thioredoxin components was tested through the insulin precipitation in the absence of DTT. The assay functions with a combination of SmTrxB or StTrxB1 with either SmTrxA or StTrxA1. These results suggest that the streptococcal members of the thioredoxin system display a direct functional interaction between them and that these protein components are interchangeable within the Streptococcus genus. In conclusion, our data prove the existence of a functioning thioredoxin system even in these microaerophiles.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of probiotics in the treatment of Candida-associated stomatitis.
AB  - This study aimed at evaluating the short-term efficacy and safety of probiotics as an aid in the treatment of Candida-associated stomatitis in a randomised controlled trial. A total of 65 patients were randomly assigned to receive oral local antifungal agents alone (gargle 2% sodium bicarbonate solution for 30 s, wait 10 min and then apply 2% nystatin paste) or these agents plus local probiotics (the mixture of Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus) three times per day for 4 weeks. Parameters related to hyperaemia, visual analogue scale scores, culture of resting saliva and a lingual dorsum swab and adverse reactions were assessed or recorded in the beginning, middle and end of treatment. Although the baseline characteristics of the participants were similar, both groups showed a significant reduction in pain level and hyperaemia on the tongue mucosa (P = 0.000) after 4-week application. However, despite the reduction in hyperaemia in the probiotic group, these improvements did not display statistically significant differences. The detection rate of Candida spp. was 100% before treatment and 8.21% in the experimental group and 34.6% in the control group after treatment. The detection rate of Candida spp. decreased (P = 0.000) in both groups and was significantly lower in the probiotic group than the control group (P = 0.038). Other analysed micro-organisms, including the decreased detection rate for Lactobacillus spp. (P = 0.049) and the increased detection rate for Staphylococcus epidermidis (P = 0.019), did not display consistent change trends in the probiotics group. Compared with conventional antifungal therapies for oral candidiasis, the inclusion of locally administered probiotics helped improve certain clinical conditions and reduced the prevalence of Candida spp., although the impact of probiotics on oral bacterial species remains to be further studied.
TI  - Efficient genome engineering in human pluripotent stem cells using Cas9 from Neisseria meningitidis.
AB  - Genome engineering in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) holds great promise for biomedical research and regenerative medicine. Recently, an RNA-guided, DNA-cleaving interference pathway from bacteria [the type II clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated (Cas) pathway] has been adapted for use in eukaryotic cells, greatly facilitating genome editing. Only two CRISPR-Cas systems (from Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus thermophilus), each with their own distinct targeting requirements and limitations, have been developed for genome editing thus far. Furthermore, limited information exists about homology-directed repair (HDR)-mediated gene targeting using long donor DNA templates in hPSCs with these systems. Here, using a distinct CRISPR-Cas system from Neisseria meningitidis, we demonstrate efficient targeting of an endogenous gene in three hPSC lines using HDR. The Cas9 RNA-guided endonuclease from N. meningitidis (NmCas9) recognizes a 5'-NNNNGATT-3' protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) different from those recognized by Cas9 proteins from S. pyogenes and S. thermophilus (SpCas9 and StCas9, respectively). Similar to SpCas9, NmCas9 is able to use a single-guide RNA (sgRNA) to direct its activity. Because of its distinct protospacer adjacent motif, the N. meningitidis CRISPR-Cas machinery increases the sequence contexts amenable to RNA-directed genome editing.
TI  - Evaluation of anti-bacterial and anti-oxidant potential of andrographolide and echiodinin isolated from callus culture of Andrographis paniculata Nees.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the anti-bacterial and anti-oxidant activity of andrographolide (AND) and echiodinin (ECH) of Andrographis paniculata. METHODS: In this study, an attempt has been made to demonstrate the anti-microbial and anti-oxidant activity of isolated AND and ECH by broth micro-dilution method and 2,2-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) assay, respectively. Structure elucidation was determined by electro-spray ionization-MSD, NMR ((1)H and (13)C) and IR spectra. RESULTS: AND was effective against most of the strains tested including Mycobacterium smegmatis, showing broad spectrum of growth inhibition activity with Minimum inhibitory concentration values against Staphylococcus aureus (100 microg/mL), Streptococcus thermophilus (350 microg/mL) Bacillus subtilis (100 microg/mL), Escherichia coli (50 microg/mL), Mycobacterium smegmatis (200 microg/mL), Klebsiella pneumonia (100 microg/mL), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (200 microg/mL). ECH showed specific anti-bacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at a concentration higher than 225 microg/mL. Both AND and ECH were not effective against the two yeast strains, Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae tested in this study. CONCLUSION: This preliminary study showed promising anti-bacterial activity and moderate free radical scavenging activity of AND and ECH, and it may provide the scientific rationale for its popular folklore medicines.
TI  - Effect of multispecies probiotic supplements on metabolic profiles, hs-CRP, and oxidative stress in patients with type 2 diabetes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We are aware of no study that has indicated the effects of daily consumption of multispecies probiotic supplements on metabolic profiles, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and oxidative stress in diabetic patients. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to determine the effects of multispecies probiotic supplements on metabolic profiles, hs-CRP, and oxidative stress in diabetic patients. METHODS: This randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed on 54 diabetic patients aged 35-70 years. Subjects were randomly assigned to take either a multispecies probiotic supplement (n = 27) or placebo (n = 27) for 8 weeks. The multispecies probiotic supplement consisted of 7 viable and freeze-dried strains: Lactobacillus acidophilus (2 x 10(9) CFU), L. casei (7 x 10(9) CFU), L. rhamnosus (1.5 x 10(9) CFU), L. bulgaricus (2 x 10(8) CFU), Bifidobacterium breve (2 x 10(10) CFU), B. longum (7 x 10(9) CFU), Streptococcus thermophilus (1.5 x 10(9) CFU), and 100 mg fructo-oligosaccharide. Fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and after intervention to measure metabolic profiles, hs-CRP, and biomarkers of oxidative stress including plasma total antioxidant capacity and total glutathione (GSH). RESULTS: Between-group comparisons of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) revealed that consumption of probiotic supplements prevented a rise in FPG (+28.8 +/- 8.5 for placebo vs. +1.6 +/- 6 mg/dl for probiotic group, p = 0.01). Although a significant within-group increase in serum insulin and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels was found in both the probiotic group and the placebo group, the changes were similar between the two groups. We observed a significant increase in HOMA-IR (homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance) in both the probiotic group (p = 0.02) and the placebo group (p = 0.001); however, the increase in the placebo group was significantly higher than that in the probiotic group (+2.38 vs. +0.78, p = 0.03). Mean changes in serum hs-CRP were significantly different between the two groups (-777.57 for the probiotic group vs. +878.72 ng/ml for the placebo group, p = 0.02). Probiotic supplementation led to a significant increase in plasma GSH levels compared to placebo (240.63 vs. -33.46 micromol/l, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, multispecies probiotic supplementation, compared with placebo, for 8 weeks in diabetic patients prevented a rise in FPG and resulted in a decrease in serum hs-CRP and an increase in plasma total GSH.
TI  - Acid induced gelation of soymilk, comparison between gels prepared with lactic acid bacteria and glucono-delta-lactone.
AB  - The objective of this work was to compare the gelation of soymilk particles induced by the acidification of a commercial starter culture with that resulting by addition of glucono-delta-lactone (GDL). Structure formation was followed using rheology, and the microstructure was observed by confocal microscopy. Acidification of lactic acid bacteria resulted in a higher gelation pH (pH 6.29+/-0.05) compared to that of a gel induced by GDL (pH 5.9+/-0.04). This difference was attributed to the longer time available for rearrangements of the soymilk particles in soymilk with starter cultures compared to the fast acidification by GDL. In spite of the earlier gelation pH, there were no observed differences in the final gel stiffness measured at pH 5.1, the value of tan delta, the frequency dependence and the linear viscoelastic range of the gels measured at the final pH. Microstructural observations also showed a similar protein network structure.
TI  - Probiotics for the prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis in neonates: an 8-year retrospective cohort study.
AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Probiotic therapy has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in premature infants in several international studies using various probiotic agents. The purpose of this study(*) is to describe our experience of using probiotic therapy in preventing NEC in infants with very low birth weight (VLBW) in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and to evaluate whether our records provide evidence of effectiveness for probiotic therapy. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study, the efficacy of probiotic therapy in preventing NEC in VLBW infants was investigated via chart review. A probiotic administration protocol using a three-strain (Streptococcus thermophilus, Bifidobacterium infantis and Bifidobacterium bifidum) supplement was implemented in August 2007. Patients admitted to the NICU from August 2003 through July 2011 were screened. Primary outcomes are the morbidity and mortality of NEC. The secondary outcomes were severity of NEC and incidence of where infant feeds were stopped but NEC was not diagnosed (NEC scare). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: There was a significant increased baseline risk of NEC development in the probiotics group, including younger gestational age, higher incidence of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and use of indomethacin. The incidence of NEC is similar between the control group (2.8%) and probiotics group (2.4%) (hazard ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.42, 3.12). Mortality of NEC is also not statistically different. Incidence of NEC scare was decreased from 2.8% in control group to 1.4% in probiotics group, although the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.38). WHAT IS KNOWN AND CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that probiotics are safe in NEC prevention in VLBW infants. We had no cases of infection related to the strains of bacteria used in our product. With the low incidence of NEC (2.8%) and NEC scare (2.8%) in our cohort, we do not have enough power to detect any change in outcome, particularly as our study was observational. However, it is hoped that our data give useful information for others on probiotic prophylactic therapy in the routine clinical management of VLBW infants.
TI  - Effects of Streptococcus thermophilus TH-4 in a rat model of doxorubicin-induced  mucositis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mucositis is a debilitating intestinal side effect of chemotherapeutic regimens. Probiotics have been considered a possible preventative treatment for mucositis. Streptococcus thermophilus TH-4 (TH-4), a newly identified probiotic, has been shown to partially alleviate mucositis induced by administration of the antimetabolite chemotherapy drug, methotrexate in rats; likely mediated through a mechanism of folate production. However, its effects against other classes of chemotherapy drug have yet to be determined. AIMS: The authors investigated the effects of TH-4 in a rat model of mucositis induced by the anthracycline chemotherapy drug, doxorubicin. METHODS: Gastrointestinal damage was induced in female Dark Agouti rats (148.3 +/- 1.5 g) by intraperitoneal injection of doxorubicin (20 mg/kg). Animals recieved a daily oral gavage of TH-4 at 10(9) cfu/ml or skim milk (vehicle) from days 0 to 8. At day 6, rats were injected with either saline or doxorubicin. At kill, small intestinal tissues were collected for determination of sucrase and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activities and histological assessment. RESULTS: Body weight was significantly decreased by doxorubicin compared with normal controls (p < 0.05). Histological parameters, such as crypt depth and villus height, were also significantly decreased by doxorubicin. TH-4 partially prevented the loss of body weight induced by doxorubicin (2.3% compared with 4%), but provided no further therapeutic benefit. CONCLUSIONS: The minimal amelioration of doxorubicin-induced mucositis by TH-4 further supports folate production as a likely mechanism of TH-4 action against methotrexate-induced mucositis. Further studies into TH-4 are required to confirm its applicability to other conventional chemotherapy regimens.
TI  - [Effect of probiotics on the dynamics of gastrointestinal symptoms of food allergy to cow's milk protein in infants].
AB  - The problem of food allergy to cow's milk protein in children is highly important. The aim of this study was to estimate the effect of Bifidobacterium lactis BB-12 (1small ha, Cyrillic109 CFU) and Streptococcus thermophilus TH-4 (1small ha, Cyrillic108 CFU) administration on gastrointestinal symptoms of cow's milk allergy in infants. We conducted an open randomized prospective clinical study. 60 infants aged of 3-12 months with the diagnosis of atopic dermatitis and allergy to cow's milk protein were enrolled. Children were divided into 2 groups, one of which received probiotics during 4 weeks. Results were estimated after 4 and 8 weeks of study. We found significant impact on reducing the frequency of constipation in infants who received the probiotics in complex treatment. After 4 weeks of treatment constipation was absent in 85.71% infants who received probiotics as compared to 48.15% in the control group (small er, Cyrillic=0.02), after 8 weeks the same numbers were 92.86% vs. 62.96% accordingly (p=0.04). Significant differences between the groups were also determined by the incidences of infantile colic through 4 and 8 weeks and on diarrhea through 8 weeks of studies. It is possible to draw a conclusion that administration of probiotics in addition to elimination diet and base treatment to infants with atopic dermatitis and cow's milk allergy improves clinical symptoms of the disease and decreases gastrointestinal clinical manifestations of cow's milk allergy.
TI  - Bacterial lysates in food allergy prevention.
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In the concept of food allergy prevention, no successful strategy could be identified until now. Although interventional trials using probiotics, prebiotics, hydrolyzed formula and bacterial lysates early in infancy were found to reduce the incidence of atopic dermatitis, no effect on food sensitization and allergy could be shown. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies in a farming environment showed that early contact to livestock, bacteria and moulds may upregulate the immune responses regulated via Toll-like receptors and thus prevent allergy. There is increasing evidence that the unbalanced composition of the human microbiome on human skin and mucosal surfaces may be a key player in the development of inflammatory diseases like allergy and asthma. However, during the last 5 years, this concept could not yet be verified in the interventional trials. There are few studies using bacterial lysates, for example, Escherichia coli plus Enterococcus faecalis in ProSymbioflor and heat-killed Bifidobacterium breve and Streptococcus thermophilus; however, food allergy prevalence could not be reduced by these interventions. SUMMARY: During the last 5 years, new interventional trials addressed the use of bacterial lysates. There was only an effect on eczema in the ProSymbioflor trial, whereas the trial using B. breve and S. thermophilus in a cow's milk formula showed a slight reduction of food sensitization at the age of 12 months. However, these strategies need further investigation and success seems to be restricted to certain subpopulations.
TI  - Probiotics improve survival of septic rats by suppressing conditioned pathogens in ascites.
AB  - AIM: To investigate the benefits of probiotics treatment in septic rats. METHODS: The septic rats were induced by cecal ligation and puncture. The animals of control, septic model and probiotics treated groups were treated with vehicle and mixed probiotics, respectively. The mixture of probiotics included Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus. We observed the survival of septic rats using different amounts of mixed probiotics. We also detected the bacterial population in ascites and blood of experimental sepsis using cultivation and real-time polymerase chain reaction. The severity of mucosal inflammation in colonic tissues was determined. RESULTS: Probiotics treatment improved survival of the rats significantly and this effect was dose dependent. The survival rate was 30% for vehicle-treated septic model group. However, 1 and 1/4 doses of probiotics treatment increased survival rate significantly compared with septic model group (80% and 55% vs 30%, P < 0.05). The total viable counts of bacteria in ascites decreased significantly in probiotics treated group compared with septic model group (5.20 +/- 0.57 vs 9.81 +/- 0.67, P < 0.05). The total positive rate of hemoculture decreased significantly in probiotics treated group compared with septic model group (33.3% vs 100.0%, P < 0.05). The population of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus in ascites of probiotics treated group were decreased significantly compared with that of septic model group (3.93 +/- 0.73 vs 8.80 +/- 0.83, P < 0.05; 2.80 +/- 1.04 vs 5.39 +/- 1.21, P < 0.05). With probiotics treatment, there was a decrease in the scores of inflammatory cell infiltration into the intestinal mucosa in septic animals (1.50 +/- 0.25 vs 2.88 +/- 0.14, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus may be primary pathogens in septic rats. Probiotics improve survival of septic rats by suppressing these conditioned pathogens.
TI  - Rapid assay to assess colonization patterns following in-vivo probiotic ingestion.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Colonization of the intestine with some microorganisms has been shown to have beneficial health effects. The association of bacteria with its human host starts soon after birth; however in infants born prematurely establishment of normal intestinal flora is interrupted with colonization with potential pathogenic organisms Probiotic supplementation may therefore be beneficial to the health of preterm infants. As most probiotic organisms are difficult to culture, confirmation of their colonization after supplementation is difficult. In this study, rapid qPCR assays for detection of presence of probiotic species in the intestine by faecal sampling is described in both preterm infant and adult participants. FINDINGS: Probiotic colonization was determined using qPCR directed at amplification of organisms present in the ingested probiotic Streptococcus thermophilus, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis and B. longum subsp. infantis. Overall, differential detection of probiotic strains in faeces were found between adult and preterm infants, with 50% of infants continuing to shed at least two probiotic strains three weeks after probiotic ingestion had ceased. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated rapid assessment of the preterm infant gut for colonization with probiotic strains using real-time PCR. This method would be of great importance in studies of probiotics in prevention of diseases and adverse clinical outcomes.
TI  - Effect of multispecies probiotics on irritable bowel syndrome: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: The efficacy of treatment with multispecies probiotics on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms and the alterations of gut microbiota in patients who have taken probiotics were investigated. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involved 49 IBS patients (probiotics: 25, placebo: 24) diagnosed according to the Rome III criteria. Patients were randomly assigned to two groups: either to receive multispecies probiotics (a mixture of Bifidobacterium longum, B. bifidum, B. lactis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. rhamnosus, and Streptococcus thermophilus) twice a day for 4 weeks or to receive a placebo twice a day for 4 weeks. The primary efficacy end-point was the proportion of participants whose IBS symptoms were substantially relieved at week 4. Secondary end-points were the intensity of abdominal pain/discomfort, bloating, stool frequency/consistency, alterations in fecal microflora over the 4 weeks. Fecal microflora were analyzed in 34 patients (probiotics: 17, placebo: 17) by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays. RESULTS: The proportion of patients whose IBS symptoms were substantially relieved at week 4 was significantly higher in the probiotics group than in the placebo group: 68.0% (17/25) versus 37.5% (9/24) (P < 0.05). Secondary end-points such as improvement in abdominal pain/discomfort and bloating occurred in the probiotics group but not in the placebo group. Fecal analysis revealed that B. lactis, L. rhamnosus, and S. thermophilus had increased significantly in the probiotics group after 4 weeks and that B. lactis had increased in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Multispecies probiotics are effective in IBS patients and induce the alterations in the composition of intestinal microbiota.
TI  - CRISPR-Cas and restriction-modification systems are compatible and increase phage resistance.
AB  - Bacteria have developed a set of barriers to protect themselves against invaders  such as phage and plasmid nucleic acids. Different prokaryotic defence systems exist and at least two of them directly target the incoming DNA: restriction-modification (R-M) and CRISPR-Cas systems. On their own, they are imperfect barriers to invasion by foreign DNA. Here, we show that R-M and CRISPR-Cas systems are compatible and act together to increase the overall phage resistance of a bacterial cell by cleaving their respective target sites. Furthermore, we show that the specific methylation of phage DNA does not impair CRISPR-Cas acquisition or interference activities. Taken altogether, both mechanisms can be leveraged to decrease phage contaminations in processes relying on bacterial growth and/or fermentation.
TI  - The influence of sweeteners in probiotic Petit Suisse cheese in concentrations equivalent to that of sucrose.
AB  - As in the case of probiotic functional foods in recent years, demand has increased notably for light or diet foods with added sweeteners. However, little is known about the effect of different sweeteners on the microorganisms present. Thus, the objective of the current study was to establish the ideal sucrose concentration and equivalent concentrations of different sweeteners and to determine, by microbiological analyses, the influence of these compounds on the viability of the starter and probiotic cultures used in the production of strawberry-flavored Petit Suisse cheese during its shelf life. The ideal sucrose concentration was determined using the just-about-right (JAR) scale, and the equivalent concentrations of the sweeteners were subsequently determined by the magnitude estimation method. Microbiological analyses were also carried out to check the viability of the cultures during the product's shelf life. The results showed that the compounds Neotame (NutraSweet, Chicago, IL) and stevia presented, respectively, the greatest and least sweetening power of the sweeteners tested. None of the sweeteners used in this study exerted a negative effect on the viability of the starter or probiotic cultures, and thus we were able to obtain a probiotic, functional food with reduced calorie content.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis reveals the coexistence of interfamily and interspecies horizontal gene transfer in Streptococcus thermophilus strains isolated from the same yoghurt.
AB  - Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is an important evolutionary mechanism that has shaped prokaryotic genomes. For Streptococcus thermophilus, there is no direct evidence that the bacteria might acquire a second paralog from a different origin in the same niche. In this study, we found that four isolates of S. thermophilus (B, C, E and F) from the same yoghurt contained two putative homologs of the eno genes (eno-1 and eno-2) and two putative homologs of the guaB genes (guaB-1 and guaB-2). Both eno-1 and guaB-1 shared 100% nucleotide identity among the four isolates, and with isolate A and S. thermophilus ND03. Phylogenetic and nucleotide divergence analyses indicated that guaB-2 of these isolates may have been acquired from species in the genus Streptococcus, while eno-2 of isolates B and C may have been acquired from a donor in the genus Streptococcus. The eno-2 genes of isolates E and F may have been acquired from a donor in the Enterococcus genera. Relative synonymous codon usage analysis confirmed the eno-2 genes of isolates E and F as being acquired from a donor in genus Enterococcus. This study provides evidence that interfamily and interspecies HGT occur in S. thermophilus strains isolated from the same niche.
TI  - Diversity of thermophilic bacteria in raw, pasteurized and selectively-cultured milk, as assessed by culturing, PCR-DGGE and pyrosequencing.
AB  - Thermophilic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) species, such as Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii and Lactobacillus helveticus, enjoy worldwide economic importance as dairy starters. To assess the diversity of thermophilic bacteria in milk, milk samples were enriched in thermophilic organisms through a stepwise procedure which included pasteurization of milk at 63 degrees C for 30 min (PM samples) and pasteurization followed by incubation at 42 degrees C for 24 h (IPM samples). The microbial composition of these samples was analyzed by culture-dependent (at 42 degrees C) and culture-independent (PCR-DGGE and pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons) microbial techniques. The results were then compared to those obtained for their corresponding starting raw milk counterparts (RM samples). Twenty different species were scored by culturing among 352 isolates purified from the counting plates and identified by molecular methods. Mesophilic LAB species (Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus garvieae) were dominant (87% of the isolates) among the RM samples. However, S. thermophilus and Lb. delbrueckii were found to be the dominant recoverable organisms in both PM and IPM samples. The DGGE profiles of RM and PM samples were found to be very similar; the most prominent bands belonging to Lactococcus, Leuconostoc and Streptococcus species. In contrast, just three DGGE bands were obtained for IPM samples, two of which were assigned to S. thermophilus. The pyrosequencing results scored 95 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 3% sequence divergence in an RM sample, while only 13 were encountered in two IPM samples. This technique identified Leuconostoc citreum as the dominant microorganism in the RM sample, while S. thermophilus constituted more than 98% of the reads in the IPM samples. The procedure followed in this study allowed to estimate the bacterial diversity in milk and afford a suitable strategy for the isolation of new thermophilic LAB strains, among which adequate starters might be selected.
TI  - Characterization of thermophilic streptococci isolated from rustic white cheese.
AB  - The thermophilic streptococci are dominant members of the microflora of several types of cheese produced with a natural starter. A total of 205 isolates of thermophilic streptococci were obtained from 70 samples of white cheese which had been collected from producing areas of different regions of Syria during 2009 and 2010. The isolates were cocci gram positive and catalase negative. From these isolates, 120 were identified as Enterococcus spp. including: 72 isolates of E. faecium, 35 isolates of E. fecalis and 13 isolates of E. durans. In addition, 70 isolates were identified as Streptococcus including: 50 isolates of S. thermophilus, and 20 isolates of S. equines. Fifteen isolates of cocci grew at 45 degrees C with spherical morphology, gram positive and catalase negative. The PCR technique could be efficiently used for identifying and typing the thermophilic streptococci.
TI  - The Streptococcus thermophilus protein Wzh functions as a phosphotyrosine phosphatase.
AB  - Amino acid residues that are important for metal binding and catalysis in Gram-positive phosphotyrosine phosphatases were identified in the Wzh protein of Streptococcus thermophilus MR-1C by using sequence comparisons. A His-tagged fusion Wzh protein was purified from Escherichia coli cultures and tested for phosphatase activity against synthetic phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine-threonine peptides. Purified Wzh released 2316.5 +/- 138.7 pmol PO4.min(-1).mug(-1) from phosphotyrosine peptide-1 and 2345.7 +/- 135.2 pmol PO4.min(-1).mug(-1) from phosphotyrosine peptide-2. The presence of the phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor sodium vanadate decreased purified Wzh activity by 45%-50% at 1 mmol.L(-1), 74%-84% at 5 mmol.L(-1), and by at least 88% at 10 mmol.L(-1). Purified Wzh had no detectable activity against the phosphoserine-threonine peptide. These results clearly establish that S. thermophilus MR-1C Wzh functions as a phosphotyrosine phosphatase that could function to remove phosphate groups from proteins involved in exopolysaccharide biosynthesis, including the protein tyrosine kinase Wze and priming glycosyltransferase.
TI  - X-ray structure of a superinfection exclusion lipoprotein from phage TP-J34 and identification of the tape measure protein as its target.
AB  - Lipoproteins of temperate phage are a broad family of membrane proteins encoded in the lysogeny module of temperate phages. Expression of the ltp(TP-J34) gene of temperate Streptococcus thermophilus phage TP-J34 interferes with phage infection at the stage of triggering DNA release and injection into the cell. Here, we report the first structure of a superinfection exclusion protein. We have expressed and determined the X-ray structure of Ltp(TP-J34). The soluble domain of Ltp(TP-J34) is composed of a tandem of three-helix helix-turn-helix (HTH) domains exhibiting a highly negatively charged surface. By isolating mutants of lactococcal phage P008wt with reduced sensitivities to Ltp(TP-J34) and by genome sequencing of such mutants we obtained evidence supporting the notion that Ltp(TP-J34) targets the phage's tape measure protein (TMP) and blocks its insertion into the cytoplasmic membrane.
TI  - Characterization of new exopolysaccharides produced by coculturing of L. kefiranofaciens with yoghurt strains.
AB  - This project was designed to study the coculturing affect of exopolysaccharide (EPS) producing strains Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens (L.k) ZW3, with non EPS producing strains L. bulgaricus (L.b) and Streptococcus thermophilus (S.t) in three different combinations: L.k+L.b, L.k+S.t, and L.k+L.b+S.t. FTIR analysis revealed presence of strong stretch in regions of 3400, 2900 and 1647cm(-1) which is characteristic of a typical polysaccharide. Co-cultured EPSs were composed of glucose, galactose, arabinose and xylose; and their sugar compositions were different from ZW3 polysaccharide that was mainly composed of gluco-galactan. Peak temperature for L.k+L.b, L.k+S.t, L.k+S.t+L.b and ZW3 polymers were 90.59, 87.61, 95.18 and 97.38 degrees C, respectively. Thermal analysis revealed degradation temperature of 326.44, 294.6, 296.7 and 299.62 degrees C for L.k+L.b, L.k+S.t, L.k+S.t+L.b and ZW3 polymers, respectively. SEM and AFM analysis divulged that three cocultured EPSs had different surface morphology than ZW3 polymer. Since co-cultured polymers have different structure than the polymer produced exclusively by EPS producing strain, it can be safely concluded from the study that co-culturing can be one way to change the structure of polymers. Coculturing of L. kefiranofaciens with non-EPS producing strains resulted in yoghurt with increased viscosity and delayed syneresis.
TI  - Incorporation of soybean by-product okara and inulin in a probiotic soy yoghurt:  texture profile and sensory acceptance.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the effect of inulin and okara flour on textural and sensory properties of probiotic soy yoghurt (SY) throughout 28 days of storage at 4 degrees C. Employing a 2(2) design, four formulations of SY produced from soymilk and fermented with an ABT-4 culture (Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5, Bifidobacterium animalis Bb-12 and Streptococcus thermophilus) were studied: SY-C (control); SY-I (with inulin); SY-O (with okara); SY-IO (with inulin + okara). RESULTS: The addition of okara and the refrigerated storage led to significant differences in the instrumental texture parameters of SY (P < 0.05). Inulin and okara did not affect SY sensory acceptability (P > 0.05), but there was a tendency for higher scores in the presence of inulin. On the other hand, the storage period, particularly at 21 days, was unfavourable regarding the acceptance of the different SY. CONCLUSION: The results showed that the addition of okara flour and the storage were significant factors to increase firmness of the soy yoghurts. SY acceptability was not affected by the incorporation of inulin or okara. These results suggest that okara, discarded as industrial waste, may be used in probiotic soy yoghurt, helping to increase the nutritional and functional properties without altering its acceptability.
TI  - Diversity of Streptococcus thermophilus in bacteriocin production; inhibitory spectrum and occurrence of thermophilin genes.
AB  - The bacteriocin-producing Streptococcus thermophilus strains that can dominate in natural dairy ecosystems, may also enhance safety in products obtained from natural cultures. In this study, we sought to identify bacteriocin production and bacteriocin genes in 75 strains of dairy and plant origin. The strains were tested for antimicrobial activity against pathogens or pathogen models, spoiling bacteria, and lactic acid bacteria associated with dairy products. All strains moderately inhibited Staphylococcus aureus P310, none inhibited Listeria innocua LMG 11387(T) or Clostridium tyrobutyricum LMG 1285(T). In addition, 14 were active against one or more indicators in addition to S. aureus P310. Inhibition of other starter bacteria was more common than the inhibition of unwanted microorganisms. The involvement of a proteinaceous compound was ascertained in all cases. Results suggested that the selection of bacteriocinogenic S. thermophilus strains for use in biopreservation must take into account the effects exerted on other lactic acid bacteria. PCR detection of thermophilin genes proved unreliable in predicting antimicrobial activity. For S. thermophilus PRI36 and PRI45, with relevant inhibitory features, the identity of the bacteriocin genes present in the thermophilin 9 cluster was defined, thus revealing novel variants for this genome region.
TI  - High-throughput analysis of type I-E CRISPR/Cas spacer acquisition in E. coli.
AB  - In Escherichia coli, the acquisition of new CRISPR spacers is strongly stimulated by a priming interaction between a spacer in CRISPR RNA and a protospacer in foreign DNA. Priming also leads to a pronounced bias in DNA strand from which new spacers are selected. Here, ca. 200,000 spacers acquired during E. coli type I-E CRISPR/Cas-driven plasmid elimination were analyzed. Analysis of positions of plasmid protospacers from which newly acquired spacers have been derived is inconsistent with spacer acquisition machinery sliding along the target DNA as the primary mechanism responsible for strand bias during primed spacer acquisition. Most protospacers that served as donors of newly acquired spacers during primed spacer acquisition had an AAG protospacer adjacent motif, PAM. Yet, the introduction of multiple AAG sequences in the target DNA had no effect on the choice of protospacers used for adaptation, which again is inconsistent with the sliding mechanism. Despite a strong preference for an AAG PAM during CRISPR adaptation, the AAG (and CTT) triplets do not appear to be avoided in known E. coli phages. Likewise, PAM sequences are not avoided in Streptococcus thermophilus phages, indicating that CRISPR/Cas systems may not have been a strong factor in shaping host-virus interactions.
TI  - Significant effect of Ca2+ on improving the heat resistance of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The heat resistance of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) has been extensively investigated due to its highly practical significance. Reconstituted skim milk (RSM) has been found to be one of the most effective protectant wall materials for microencapsulating microorganisms during convective drying, such as spray drying. In addition to proteins and carbohydrate, RSM is rich in calcium. It is not clear which component is critical in the RSM protection mechanism. This study investigated the independent effect of calcium. Ca(2+) was added to lactose solution to examine its influence on the heat resistance of Lactobacillus rhamnosus ZY, Lactobacillus casei Zhang, Lactobacillus plantarum P8 and Streptococcus thermophilus ND03. The results showed that certain Ca(2+) concentrations enhanced the heat resistance of the LAB strains to different extents, that is produced higher survival and shorter regrowth lag times of the bacterial cells. In some cases, the improvements were dramatic. More scientifically insightful and more intensive instrumental study of the Ca(2+) behavior around and in the cells should be carried out in the near future. In the meantime, this work may lead to the development of more cost-effective wall materials with Ca(2+) added as a prime factor.
TI  - Diversity of human small intestinal Streptococcus and Veillonella populations.
AB  - Molecular and cultivation approaches were employed to study the phylogenetic richness and temporal dynamics of Streptococcus and Veillonella populations in the small intestine. Microbial profiling of human small intestinal samples collected from four ileostomy subjects at four time points displayed abundant populations of Streptococcus spp. most affiliated with S. salivarius, S. thermophilus, and S. parasanguinis, as well as Veillonella spp. affiliated with V. atypica, V. parvula, V. dispar, and V. rogosae. Relative abundances varied per subject and time of sampling. Streptococcus and Veillonella isolates were cultured using selective media from ileostoma effluent samples collected at two time points from a single subject. The richness of the Streptococcus and Veillonella isolates was assessed at species and strain level by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and genetic fingerprinting, respectively. A total of 160 Streptococcus and 37 Veillonella isolates were obtained. Genetic fingerprinting differentiated seven Streptococcus lineages from ileostoma effluent, illustrating the strain richness within this ecosystem. The Veillonella isolates were represented by a single phylotype. Our study demonstrated that the small intestinal Streptococcus populations displayed considerable changes over time at the genetic lineage level because only representative strains of a single Streptococcus lineage could be cultivated from ileostoma effluent at both time points.
TI  - Genomic analysis of dairy starter culture Streptococcus thermophilus MTCC 5461.
AB  - The lactic acid bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus is widely used as a starter  culture for the production of dairy products. Whole-genome sequencing is expected to utilize the genetic basis behind the metabolic functioning of lactic acid bacterium (LAB), for development of their use in biotechnological and probiotic applications. We sequenced the whole genome of Streptococcus thermophilus MTCC 5461, the strain isolated from a curd source, by 454 GS-FLX titanium and Ion Torrent PGM. We performed comparative genome analysis using the local BLAST and RDP for 16S rDNA comparison and by the RAST server for functional comparison against the published genome sequence of Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ 1066. The whole genome size of S. thermophilus MTCC 5461 is of 1.73Mb size with a GC content of 39.3%. Streptococcal virulence-related genes are either inactivated or absent in the strain. The genome possesses coding sequences for features important for a probiotic organism such as adhesion, acid tolerance, bacteriocin production, and lactose utilization, which was found to be conserved among the strains MTCC 5461 and CNRZ 1066. Biochemical analysis revealed the utilization of 17 sugars by the bacterium, where the presence of genes encoding enzymes involved in metabolism for 16 of these 17 sugars were confirmed in the genome. This study supports the facts that the strain MTCC 5461 is nonpathogenic and harbors essential features that can be exploited for its probiotic potential.
TI  - [Clinical effectiveness of probiotics in complex treatment of infants with cow's  milk allergy].
AB  - 6-8% of infants have food hypersensitivity or allergy that often manifest as atopic dermatitis. Formation of intestinal microbiocenosis is occurring during the same age range. There are some research data about the influence of probiotic on clinical course of atopic dermatitis. The aim of this study was to estimate the effect of Bifidobacterium lactis BB-12 (1 small ha, Cyrillic 10(9 0 CFU) and Streptococcus thermophilus TH-4 (1 small ha, Cyrillic 10(8) CFU) administration to infants with atopic dermatitis and cow's milk allergy. We conducted an open randomized prospective clinical study. 60 infants aged of 3-12 months with the diagnosis of atopic dermatitis and allergy to cow's milk protein were enrolled. Children were divided into 2 groups, one of that received probiotic during 4 weeks. Results were estimated with SCORAD scoring after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. The difference in SCORAD scores between a visit 1 and a visit 3 in infants who in complex treatment received the probiotic strains was 44,05 (3,97) as compared with 38,94 (5,65) in the control group (small er, Cyrillic<0,05). As a result of our study it is possible to draw a conclusion that administration of probiotics to infants with atopic dermatitis and cow's milk allergy in addition to elimination diet and base treatment improves clinical symptoms of the disease.
TI  - Phage biocontrol of enteropathogenic and Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli during milk fermentation.
AB  - Two bacteriophages, isolated from faeces, were assayed as biocontrol agents of pathogenic Escherichia coli during milk fermentation. Phage DT1 was tested on the strain E. coli DH5alpha, one enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) strain and one Shiga toxigenic E. coli O157:H7 (STEC) strain. Phage DT6 was tested on two STEC strains (O157:H7 and non-O157). One additional assay was performed by using a cocktail of both phages against the O157:H7 STEC strain. Streptococcus thermophilus 10-C, the strain used as lactic starter, reached 10(9) CFU ml(-1) after 4 h, while pH values fell to 4.5 after 8 h, regardless of the presence of E. coli strains and/or phages. In absence of phages, E. coli strains reached 4-6 log CFU ml(-1) at 5-6 h. Escherichia coli DH5alpha and O157:H7 STEC strains were rapidly and completely inactivated by phage DT1 and phage cocktail, respectively, while O157:H7 STEC was completely inactivated either by DT1 or by DT6, after 8 h. The EPEC strain was not detected at 1 h (<10 CFU ml(-1) ) but grew afterwards, though at lower rates than without phage. For non-O157:H7 STEC, reductions lower than 1 log CFU ml(-1) were observed for all sampling times. Phages DT1 and DT6, either individually or as a cocktail, effectively reduce O157:H7 STEC counts during milk fermentation, without compromising the starter culture performance. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Coliphages DT1 and DT6, isolated from faeces and selected on the basis of their host range, showed to be valuable tools for the control of pathogenic Escherichia coli during milk fermentation, without compromising the starter culture performance. Both phages, either individually or as a cocktail, may function as an extra safety barrier beyond traditional pasteurization, effectively reducing O157:H7 Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) counts during early growth, thus avoiding Shiga toxin production and accumulation.
TI  - Effect of probiotic species on irritable bowel syndrome symptoms: A bring up to date meta-analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: immune system alteration in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients may be modulated by probiotics. We assessed the efficacy of some probiotic species in alleviating characteristic IBS symptoms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: a meta-analysis of all identified randomized controlled trials comparing probiotics with placebo in treating IBS symptoms was performed with continuous data summarized using standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), where appropriate. The random-effects model was employed in cases of heterogeneity; otherwise, fixed-effects models were used. RESULTS: meta-analysis was performed with 10 of 24 studies identified as suitable for inclusion. Probiotics improved pain scores if they contained Bifidobacterium breve (SMD, - 0.34; 95% CI, - 0.66; -0.02), Bifidobacterium longum (SMD, -0.48; 95% CI, - 0.91; -0.06), or Lactobacillus acidophilus (SMD, -0.31; 95% CI, -0.61; -0.01) species. Distension scores were improved by probiotics containing B. breve (SMD, -0.45; 95% CI, -0.77; -0.13), Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus casei, or Lactobacillus plantarum (SMD, -0.53; 95% CI, -1.00; -0.06) species. All probiotic species tested improved flatulence: B. breve (SMD, -0.42; 95% CI, -0.75;- 0.10), B. infantis, L. casei, L. plantarum (SMD, -0.60; 95% CI, -1.07; -0.13), B. longum, L. acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus (SMD, -0.61; 95% CI, -1.01; -0.21). There was not a clear positive effect of probiotics concerning the quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: some probiotics are an effective therapeutic option for IBS patients, and the effects on each IBS symptom are likely species-specific. Future studies must focus on the role of probiotics in modulating intestinal microbiota and the immune system while considering individual patient symptom profiles.
TI  - Impact of inulin and okara on Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 and Bifidobacterium  animalis Bb-12 viability in a fermented soy product and probiotic survival under in vitro simulated gastrointestinal conditions.
AB  - The effect of inulin and/or okara flour on Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 and Bifidobacterium animalis Bb-12 viability in a fermented soy product (FSP) and on probiotic survival under in vitro simulated gastrointestinal conditions were investigated throughout 28 days of storage at 4 degrees C. Employing a 2(2) design, four FSP trials were produced from soymilk fermented with ABT-4 culture (La-5, Bb-12, and Streptococcus thermophilus): FSP (control); FSP-I (with inulin, 3 g/100 mL of soymilk); FSP-O (with okara, 5 g/100 mL); FSP-IO (with inulin + okara, ratio 3:5 g/100 mL). Probiotic viabilities ranged from 8 to 9 log cfu/g during the 28 days of storage, and inulin and/or okara flour did not affect the viability of La-5 and Bb-12. Bb-12 resistance to the artificial gastrointestinal juices was higher than for La-5, since the Bb-12 and La-5 populations decreased approximately 0.6 log cfu/g and 3.8 log cfu/g, respectively, throughout storage period. Even though the protective effect of inulin and/or okara flour on probiotic microorganisms was not significant, when compared to a fresh culture, the FSP matrix improved Bb-12 survival on day 1 of storage and may be considered a good vehicle for Bb-12 and could play an important role in probiotic protection against gastrointestinal juices.
TI  - crRNA and tracrRNA guide Cas9-mediated DNA interference in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The Cas9-crRNA complex of the Streptococcus thermophilus DGCC7710 CRISPR3-Cas system functions as an RNA-guided endonuclease with crRNA-directed target sequence recognition and protein-mediated DNA cleavage. We show here that an additional RNA molecule, tracrRNA (trans-activating CRISPR RNA), co-purifies with the Cas9 protein isolated from the heterologous E. coli strain carrying the S. thermophilus DGCC7710 CRISPR3-Cas system. We provide experimental evidence that tracrRNA is required for Cas9-mediated DNA interference both in vitro and in vivo. We show that Cas9 specifically promotes duplex formation between the precursor crRNA (pre-crRNA) transcript and tracrRNA, in vitro. Furthermore, the housekeeping RNase III contributes to primary pre-crRNA-tracrRNA duplex cleavage for mature crRNA biogenesis. RNase III, however, is not required in the processing of a short pre-crRNA transcribed from a minimal CRISPR array containing a single spacer. Finally, we show that an in vitro-assembled ternary Cas9-crRNA-tracrRNA complex cleaves DNA. This study further specifies the molecular basis for crRNA-based re-programming of Cas9 to specifically cleave any target DNA sequence for precise genome surgery. The processes for crRNA maturation and effector complex assembly established here will contribute to the further development of the Cas9 re-programmable system for genome editing applications.
TI  - Thermo-regulated adhesion of the Streptococcus thermophilus Deltargg0182 strain.
AB  - The physicochemical determinants governing the temperature-dependent adhesion of  Streptococcus thermophilus to abiotic surfaces are identified under physiological condition for cells either lacking or not the Rgg0182 transcriptional regulator involved in their thermal adaptation. For that purpose, the wild type LMG18311 strain and Deltargg0182 mutant were imaged using highly resolved atomic force microscopy (AFM) at various cell growth temperatures (42 to 55 degrees C). The corresponding hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance of the cells was quantitatively addressed via the measurement by chemical force microcopy of their adhesion to a reference hydrophobic surface. Analysis of force-separation distance curves further allowed us to discriminate cell surfaces according to the presence or absence of biopolymers. These results were interpreted in relation to the measured adhesion of the Deltargg0182 mutant onto the hydrophobic wall of microwells in the temperature range from 46 to 52 degrees C. It is evidenced that the viscoelastic Deltargg0182 cell envelop behaves as a thermo-responsive film whose hydrophobicity increases with increasing temperature, thereby favoring cell attachment to hydrophobic surfaces. Regardless cell growth temperature, wild-type cells do not attach to hydrophobic surfaces and the presence of the Rgg0182 transcriptional regulator is associated with the synthesis of hydrophilic cell surface biopolymers. Throughout, the impact of electrostatics on bioadhesion is ruled out upon examination of electrohydrodynamic cell properties at 50 degrees C.
TI  - Comparative genome analysis of Streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius CJ18, an African fermented camel milk isolate with adaptations to dairy environment.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius (Sii) belongs to the Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex associated with several human and animal infections. Sii is a predominant bacterium in spontaneously fermented milk products in Africa. The genome sequence of Sii strain CJ18 was compared with that of other Streptococcus species to identify dairy adaptations including genome decay such as in Streptococcus thermophilus, traits for its competitiveness in spontaneous milk fermentation and to assess potential health risks for consumers. RESULTS: The genome of Sii CJ18 harbors several unique regions in comparison to Sii ATCC BAA-102T, among others an enlarged exo- and capsular polysaccharide operon; Streptococcus thermophilus-associated genes; a region containing metabolic and hypothetical genes mostly unique to CJ18 and the dairy isolate Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus; and a second oligopeptide transport operon. Dairy adaptations in CJ18 are reflected by a high percentage of pseudogenes (4.9%) representing genome decay which includes the inactivation of the lactose phosphotransferase system (lacIIABC) by multiple transposases integration. The presence of lacS and lacZ genes is the major dairy adaptation affecting lactose metabolism pathways also due to the disruption of lacIIABC.We constructed mutant strains of lacS, lacZ and lacIIABC and analyzed the resulting strains of CJ18 to confirm the redirection of lactose metabolism via LacS and LacZ.Natural competence genes are conserved in both Sii strains, but CJ18 contains a lower number of CRISPR spacers which indicates a reduced defense capability against alien DNA. No classical streptococcal virulence factors were detected in both Sii strains apart from those involved in adhesion which should be considered niche factors. Sii-specific virulence factors are not described. Several Sii-specific regions encoding uncharacterized proteins provide new leads for virulence analyses and investigation of the unclear association of dairy and clinical Sii with human diseases. CONCLUSIONS: The genome of the African dairy isolate Sii CJ18 clearly differs from the human isolate ATCC BAA-102T. CJ18 possesses a high natural competence predisposition likely explaining the enlarged genome. Metabolic adaptations to the dairy environment are evident and especially lactose uptake corresponds to S. thermophilus. Genome decay is not as advanced as in S. thermophilus (10-19%) possibly due to a shorter history in dairy fermentations.
TI  - The population and evolutionary dynamics of phage and bacteria with CRISPR-mediated immunity.
AB  - Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR), together with associated genes (cas), form the CRISPR-cas adaptive immune system, which can provide resistance to viruses and plasmids in bacteria and archaea. Here, we use mathematical models, population dynamic experiments, and DNA sequence analyses to investigate the host-phage interactions in a model CRISPR-cas system, Streptococcus thermophilus DGCC7710 and its virulent phage 2972. At the molecular level, the bacteriophage-immune mutant bacteria (BIMs) and CRISPR-escape mutant phage (CEMs) obtained in this study are consistent with those anticipated from an iterative model of this adaptive immune system: resistance by the addition of novel spacers and phage evasion of resistance by mutation in matching sequences or flanking motifs. While CRISPR BIMs were readily isolated and CEMs generated at high rates (frequencies in excess of 10(-6)), our population studies indicate that there is more to the dynamics of phage-host interactions and the establishment of a BIM-CEM arms race than predicted from existing assumptions about phage infection and CRISPR-cas immunity. Among the unanticipated observations are: (i) the invasion of phage into populations of BIMs resistant by the acquisition of one (but not two) spacers, (ii) the survival of sensitive bacteria despite the presence of high densities of phage, and (iii) the maintenance of phage-limited communities due to the failure of even two-spacer BIMs to become established in populations with wild-type bacteria and phage. We attribute (i) to incomplete resistance of single-spacer BIMs. Based on the results of additional modeling and experiments, we postulate that (ii) and (iii) can be attributed to the phage infection-associated production of enzymes or other compounds that induce phenotypic phage resistance in sensitive bacteria and kill resistant BIMs. We present evidence in support of these hypotheses and discuss the implications of these results for the ecology and (co)evolution of bacteria and phage.
TI  - Physical model of the immune response of bacteria against bacteriophage through the adaptive CRISPR-Cas immune system.
AB  - Bacteria and archaea have evolved an adaptive, heritable immune system that recognizes and protects against viruses or plasmids. This system, known as the CRISPR-Cas system, allows the host to recognize and incorporate short foreign DNA or RNA sequences, called 'spacers' into its CRISPR system. Spacers in the CRISPR system provide a record of the history of bacteria and phage coevolution. We use a physical model to study the dynamics of this coevolution as it evolves stochastically over time. We focus on the impact of mutation and recombination on bacteria and phage evolution and evasion. We discuss the effect of different spacer deletion mechanisms on the coevolutionary dynamics. We make predictions about bacteria and phage population growth, spacer diversity within the CRISPR locus, and spacer protection against the phage population.
TI  - CRISPRTarget: bioinformatic prediction and analysis of crRNA targets.
AB  - The bacterial and archaeal CRISPR/Cas adaptive immune system targets specific protospacer nucleotide sequences in invading organisms. This requires base pairing between processed CRISPR RNA and the target protospacer. For type I and II CRISPR/Cas systems, protospacer adjacent motifs (PAM) are essential for target recognition, and for type III, mismatches in the flanking sequences are important in the antiviral response. In this study, we examine the properties of each class of CRISPR. We use this information to provide a tool (CRISPRTarget) that predicts the most likely targets of CRISPR RNAs (http://bioanalysis.otago.ac.nz/CRISPRTarget). This can be used to discover targets in newly sequenced genomic or metagenomic data. To test its utility, we discover features and targets of well-characterized Streptococcus thermophilus and Sulfolobus solfataricus type II and III CRISPR/Cas systems. Finally, in Pectobacterium species, we identify new CRISPR targets and propose a model of temperate phage exposure and subsequent inhibition by the type I CRISPR/Cas systems.
TI  - Characterization of soybean protein hydrolysates able to promote the proliferation of Streptococcus thermophilus ST.
AB  - How soybean protein hydrolysates (SPHs) to favor the growth of S. thermophilus ST were investigated. Hydrolyzed soybean protein was fractionated to 4 fragments, that is, SPH-I, SPH-II, SPH-III, and SPH-IV according to their molecular weight sizes. SPHs can improve the growth of strain ST, in which SPH-IV, with the molecular weight of less than 5 kD, significantly promoted the growth of strain ST. The cell counts of strain ST grew quickly from 7.71 to 9.78 (log CFU/mL) when the concentrations of SPH-IV ranging from 0% to 1%. Moreover, 2 chemically defined media (CDMs) were used to test their roles in maintaining the viability of strain ST. CDMs only maintained the survival of strain ST, but SPH-IV had the promotional effects on proliferation of the bacteria. SPH-IV was further characterized to be oligopeptides that contain 2 to 8 amino acids and free amino acids by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) analysis. The amino acid compositions showed that SPH-IV contained more essential amino acids, which were necessary for the growth of S. thermophilus ST. Clearly, SPH-IV could be used as an exogenous nitrogen supplement to enhance the proliferation of S. thermophilus ST and other lactic acid bacteria, and the data from small scale-up fermentation also supported this point.
TI  - Improved growth of Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus as well as Increased antioxidant activity by biotransforming litchi pericarp polysaccharide with Aspergillus awamori.
AB  - This study was conducted to increase the bioactivity of litchi pericarp polysaccharides (LPPs) biotransformed by Aspergillus awamori. Compared to the non-A. awamori-fermented LPP, the growth effects of A. awamori-fermented LPP on Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus were four and two times higher after 3 days of fermentation, respectively. Increased 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity and DNA protection activity of litchi pericarp polysaccharides were also achieved after A. awamori fermentation. Moreover, the relative content of glucose and arabinose in LPP after fermentation decreased from 58.82% to 22.60% and from 18.82% to 10.09%, respectively, with a concomitant increase in the relative contents of galactose, rhamnose, xylose, and mannose. Furthermore, lower molecular weight polysaccharides were obtained after A. awamori fermentation. It can be concluded that A. awamori was effective in biotransforming LPP into a bioactive mixture with lower molecular weight polysaccharides and higher antioxidant activity and relative galactose content.
TI  - Assessment of the susceptibility of lactic acid bacteria to biocides.
AB  - Biocides are antimicrobial compounds that are widely used in the food industry and medical environments. In this study, we determined the Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) by the microdilution method of four different biocides for a large collection of LAB of different origins. The tested isolates belong to 11 species of the Lactobacillus genus and to Streptococcus thermophilus, Streptococcus salivarius and Lactococcus garvieae. The results obtained in this study indicate that low susceptibilities to benzalkonium chloride (BC), triclosan (Tr), chlorhexidine (Ch), and sodium hypochlorite (SH) are not frequent among LAB. Moreover, no systematic co-tolerance between two or more tested biocides was found; that is, strains displaying high MIC values and thus low sensitivity to one of the biocides did not show higher MIC values for the other biocides.
TI  - Consumption of fermented milk product with probiotic modulates brain activity.
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Changes in gut microbiota have been reported to alter signaling mechanisms, emotional behavior, and visceral nociceptive reflexes in rodents. However, alteration of the intestinal microbiota with antibiotics or probiotics has not been shown to produce these changes in humans. We investigated whether consumption of a fermented milk product with probiotic (FMPP) for 4 weeks by healthy women altered brain intrinsic connectivity or responses to emotional attention tasks. METHODS: Healthy women with no gastrointestinal or psychiatric symptoms were randomly assigned to groups given FMPP (n = 12), a nonfermented milk product (n = 11, controls), or no intervention (n = 13) twice daily for 4 weeks. The FMPP contained Bifidobacterium animalis subsp Lactis, Streptococcus thermophiles, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, and Lactococcus lactis subsp Lactis. Participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging before and after the intervention to measure brain response to an emotional faces attention task and resting brain activity. Multivariate and region of interest analyses were performed. RESULTS: FMPP intake was associated with reduced task-related response of a distributed functional network (49% cross-block covariance; P = .004) containing affective, viscerosensory, and somatosensory cortices. Alterations in intrinsic activity of resting brain indicated that ingestion of FMPP was associated with changes in midbrain connectivity, which could explain the observed differences in activity during the task. CONCLUSIONS: Four-week intake of an FMPP by healthy women affected activity of brain regions that control central processing of emotion and sensation.
TI  - Probiotics and prebiotics in preventing episodes of acute otitis media in high-risk children: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies have suggested that probiotics (proB) and/or prebiotics (preB) could reduce the burden of infection in infants and toddlers. We aimed to determine whether follow-up formula supplemented with proB and preB could reduce the risk of acute otitis media (AOM). METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial from November 2007 to April 2009, 37 pediatricians in France enrolled children 7 to 13 months of age with high risk of AOM who were randomly assigned to receive follow-up formula supplemented with proB (Streptococcus thermophilus NCC 2496, Streptococcus salivarius DSM 13084, Lactobacillus rhamnosus LPR CGMCC 1.3724) and preB (Raftilose/Raftiline) or follow-up formula alone (placebo). During 12 months, the 2 groups were compared for number of AOM episodes diagnosed (primary outcome) and secondary outcomes by the Poisson model (incidence rate ratio [IRR]) or logistic regression (odds ratio; and 95% confidence interval [95% CI]) after adjustment on covariates of interest. RESULTS: We enrolled 224 children (112 in each group). All children were vaccinated (4 doses) with the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine; demographic characteristics were similar in the 2 groups. In total, 486 AOM episodes were reported, 249 and 237 in the treatment and control groups, respectively. The treatment and control groups did not differ in incidence of AOM (IRR 1.0, 95% CI: 0.8-1.2), lower respiratory tract infections (IRR 0.9, 0.7-1.2) or number of antibiotic treatment courses (IRR = 1.0, 95% CI: 0.8-1.2). Treatment was not associated with recurrent AOM (odds ratio 1.0, 95% CI: 0.5-1.7). With regard to gastrointestinal disorders, both formulas were well tolerated. CONCLUSION: The proB and preB included in follow-up formula given to children at 7 to 13 months of age did not reduce the risk of AOM, recurrent AOM, antibiotic use or lower respiratory tract infections at 1 year.
TI  - Monitoring lactic acid production during milk fermentation by in situ quantitative proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
AB  - When fermenting milk, lactic bacteria convert part of alpha- and beta-lactoses into d- and l- lactic acids, causing a pH decrease responsible for casein coagulation. Lactic acid monitoring during fermentation is essential for the control of dairy gel textural and organoleptic properties, and is a way to evaluate strain efficiency. Currently, titrations are used to follow the quantity of acids formed during jellification of milk but they are not specific to lactic acid. An analytical method without the use of any reagent was investigated to quantify lactic acid during milk fermentation: in situ quantitative proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Two methods using in situ quantitative proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy were compared: (1) d- and l-lactic acids content determination, using the resonance of their methyl protons, showing an increase from 2.06 +/- 0.02 to 8.16 +/- 0.74 g/L during 240 min of fermentation; and (2) the determination of the alpha- and beta-lactoses content, decreasing from 42.68 +/- 0.02 to 30.76 +/- 1.75 g/L for the same fermentation duration. The ratio between the molar concentrations of produced lactic acids and consumed lactoses enabled cross-validation, as the value (2.02 +/- 0.18) is consistent with lactic acid bacteria metabolism.
TI  - Extracellular life cycle of ComS, the competence-stimulating peptide of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - In streptococci, ComX is the alternative sigma factor controlling the transcription of the genes encoding the genetic transformation machinery. In Streptococcus thermophilus, comX transcription is controlled by a complex consisting of a transcriptional regulator of the Rgg family, ComR, and a signaling peptide, ComS, which controls ComR activity. Following its initial production, ComS is processed, secreted, and imported back into the cell by the Ami oligopeptide transporter. We characterized these steps and the partners interacting with ComS during its extracellular circuit in more detail. We identified the mature form of ComS and demonstrated the involvement of the membrane protease Eep in ComS processing. We found that ComS was secreted but probably not released into the extracellular medium. Natural competence was first discovered in a chemically defined medium without peptides. We show here that the presence of a high concentration of nutritional peptides in the medium prevents the triggering of competence. In milk, the ecological niche of S. thermophilus, competence was found to be functional, suggesting that the concentration of nutritional peptides was too low to interfere with ComR activation. The kinetics of expression of the comS, comR, and comX genes and of a late competence gene, dprA, in cultures inoculated at different initial densities revealed that the activation mechanism of ComR by ComS is more a timing device than a quorum-sensing mechanism sensu stricto. We concluded that the ComS extracellular circuit facilitates tight control over the triggering of competence in S. thermophilus.
TI  - Strong bias in the bacterial CRISPR elements that confer immunity to phage.
AB  - Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas systems provide adaptive immunity against phage via spacer-encoded CRISPR RNAs that are complementary to invasive nucleic acids. Here, we challenge Streptococcus thermophilus with a bacteriophage, and used PCR-based metagenomics to monitor phage-derived spacers daily for 15 days in two experiments. Spacers that target the host chromosome are infrequent and strongly selected against, suggesting autoimmunity is lethal. In experiments that recover over half a million spacers, we observe early dominance by a few spacer sub-populations and rapid oscillations in sub-population abundances. In two CRISPR systems and in replicate experiments, a few spacers account for the majority of spacer sequences. Nearly all phage locations targeted by the acquired spacers have a proto-spacer adjacent motif (PAM), indicating PAMs are involved in spacer acquisition. We detect a strong and reproducible bias in the phage genome locations from which spacers derive. This may reflect selection for specific spacers based on location and effectiveness.
TI  - Assembly and mechanism of a group II ECF transporter.
AB  - Energy-coupling factor (ECF) transporters are a recently discovered family of primary active transporters for micronutrients and vitamins, such as biotin, thiamine, and riboflavin. Found exclusively in archaea and bacteria, including the human pathogens Listeria, Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus, ECF transporters may be the only means of vitamin acquisition in these organisms. The subunit composition of ECF transporters is similar to that of ATP binding cassette (ABC) importers, whereby both systems share two homologous ATPase subunits (A and A'), a high affinity substrate-binding subunit (S), and a transmembrane coupling subunit (T). However, the S subunit of ECF transporters is an integral membrane protein, and the transmembrane coupling subunits do not share an obvious sequence homology between the two transporter families. Moreover, the subunit stoichiometry of ECF transporters is controversial, and the detailed molecular interactions between subunits and the conformational changes during substrate translocation are unknown. We have characterized the ECF transporters from Thermotoga maritima and Streptococcus thermophilus. Our data suggests a subunit stoichiometry of 2S:2T:1A:1A' and that S subunits for different substrates can be incorporated into the same transporter complex simultaneously. In the first crystal structure of the A-A' heterodimer, each subunit contains a novel motif called the Q-helix that plays a key role in subunit coupling with the T subunits. Taken together, these findings suggest a mechanism for coupling ATP binding and hydrolysis to transmembrane transport by ECF transporters.
TI  - In vitro reconstitution of Cascade-mediated CRISPR immunity in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-encoded immunity in Type I systems relies on the Cascade (CRISPR-associated complex for antiviral defence) ribonucleoprotein complex, which triggers foreign DNA degradation by an accessory Cas3 protein. To establish the mechanism for adaptive immunity provided by the Streptococcus thermophilus CRISPR4-Cas (CRISPR-associated) system (St-CRISPR4-Cas), we isolated an effector complex (St-Cascade) containing 61-nucleotide CRISPR RNA (crRNA). We show that St-Cascade, guided by crRNA, binds in vitro to a matching proto-spacer if a proto-spacer adjacent motif (PAM) is present. Surprisingly, the PAM sequence determined from binding analysis is promiscuous and limited to a single nucleotide (A or T) immediately upstream (-1 position) of the proto-spacer. In the presence of a correct PAM, St-Cascade binding to the target DNA generates an R-loop that serves as a landing site for the Cas3 ATPase/nuclease. We show that Cas3 binding to the displaced strand in the R-loop triggers DNA cleavage, and if ATP is present, Cas3 further degrades DNA in a unidirectional manner. These findings establish a molecular basis for CRISPR immunity in St-CRISPR4-Cas and other Type I systems.
TI  - Increasing antioxidant activity of procyanidin extracts from the pericarp of Litchi chinensis processing waste by two probiotic bacteria bioconversions.
AB  - Litchi chinensis pericarp from litchi processing waste is an important plant source of A-type procyanidins, which were considered a natural dietary supplement because of their high biological activity in vivo. Litchi pericarp oligomeric procyanidins (LPOPCs) did not selectively modify the growth of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus casei -01 at concentrations of 0.25 and 0.5 mg/mL, and it was demonstrated that the two strains could transform procyanidins during their log period of growth by two different pathways. S. thermophilus was able to metabolize procyanidin A2 to its isomer, and L. casei could decompose flavan-3-ols into 3,4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, 4-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid, m-coumaric acid, and p-coumaric acid. The total antioxidant capability (T-AOC) of LPOPCs before and after microbial incubation was estimated, and the results suggested that probiotic bacteria bioconversion is a feasible and efficient method to convert litchi pericarp procyanidins to a more effective antioxidant agent.
TI  - High-resolution heteronuclear multidimensional NMR of proteins in living insect cells using a baculovirus protein expression system.
AB  - Recent developments in in-cell NMR techniques have allowed us to study proteins in detail inside living eukaryotic cells. In order to complement the existing protocols, and to extend the range of possible applications, we introduce a novel approach for observing in-cell NMR spectra using the sf9 cell/baculovirus system. High-resolution 2D (1)H-(15)N correlation spectra were observed for four model proteins expressed in sf9 cells. Furthermore, 3D triple-resonance NMR spectra of the Streptococcus protein G B1 domain were observed in sf9 cells by using nonlinear sampling to overcome the short lifetime of the samples and the low abundance of the labeled protein. The data were processed with a quantitative maximum entropy algorithm. These were assigned ab initio, yielding approximately 80% of the expected backbone NMR resonances. Well-resolved NOE cross peaks could be identified in the 3D (15)N-separated NOESY spectrum, suggesting that structural analysis of this size of protein will be feasible in sf9 cells.
TI  - Mechanism of competence activation by the ComRS signalling system in streptococci.
AB  - In many streptococci, competence for natural DNA transformation is regulated by the Rgg-type regulator ComR and the pheromone ComS, which is sensed intracellularly. We compared the ComRS systems of four model streptococcal species using in vitro and in silico approaches, to determine the mechanism of the ComRS-dependent regulation of competence. In all systems investigated, ComR was shown to be the proximal transcriptional activator of the expression of key competence genes. Efficient binding of ComR to DNA is strictly dependent on the presence of the pheromone (C-terminal ComS octapeptide), in contrast with other streptococcal Rgg-type regulators. The 20 bp palindromic ComR-box is the minimal genetic requirement for binding of ComR, and its sequence directly determines the expression level of genes under its control. Despite the apparent species-specific specialization of the ComR-ComS interaction, mutagenesis of ComS residues from Streptococcus thermophilus highlighted an unexpected permissiveness with respect to its biological activity. In agreement, heterologous ComS, and even primary sequence-unrelated, casein-derived octapeptides, were able to induce competence development in S. thermophilus. The lack of stringency of ComS sequence suggests that competence of a specific Streptococcus species may be modulated by other streptococci or by non-specific nutritive oligopeptides present in its environment.
TI  - Effect of lactic fermentation on the total phenolic, saponin and phytic acid contents as well as anti-colon cancer cell proliferation activity of soymilk.
AB  - In an attempt to develop healthy dietary adjuncts, soymilk was fermented simultaneously with Streptococcus thermophilus 14085 and Bifidobacterium infantis 14603 at 37 degrees C for 24 h. It was found that lactic fermentation reduced the content of saponins and phytates, which possess antinutritional activity, and enhanced the total phenolic content as well as antitumor cell proliferation effect of soymilk against HT-29 and Caco-2 cells. The original antitumor cell component, starter organisms, and antitumor cell bioactive principles formed in soymilk during fermentation, might all have contributed to the enhanced antitumor activity of fermented soymilk. The antiproliferative effect of the extracts varied with extraction solvent. Extracts obtained from fermented soymilk with 80% methanol exhibited the highest suppression effect on the proliferation of HT-29 and Caco-2 cells. This study further stresses the potential of developing soymilk as a healthy dietary adjunct possessing enhanced anticancer activity through the use of lactic fermentation.
TI  - Development of a multiplex real time PCR to detect thermophilic lactic acid bacteria in natural whey starters.
AB  - A multiplex real time PCR (mRealT-PCR) useful to rapidly screen microbial composition of thermophilic starter cultures for hard cooked cheeses and to compare samples with potentially different technological properties was developed. Novel primers directed toward pheS gene were designed and optimized for multiple detection of Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus fermentum. The assay was based on SYBR Green chemistry followed by melting curves analysis. The method was then evaluated for applications in the specific detection of the 4 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in 29 different natural whey starters for Parmigiano Reggiano cheese production. The results obtained by mRealT-PCR were also compared with those obtained on the same samples by Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH) and Length-Heterogeneity PCR (LH-PCR). The mRealT-PCR developed in this study, was found to be effective for analyzing species present in the samples with an average sensitivity down to less than 600 copies of DNA and therefore sensitive enough to detect even minor LAB community members of thermophilic starter cultures. The assay was able to describe the microbial population of all the different natural whey starter samples analyzed, despite their natural variability. A higher number of whey starter samples with S. thermophilus and L. fermentum present in their microbial community were revealed, suggesting that these species could be more frequent in Parmigiano Reggiano natural whey starter samples than previously shown. The method was more effective than LH-PCR and FISH and, considering that these two techniques have to be used in combination to detect the less abundant species, the mRealT-PCR was also faster. Providing a single step sensitive detection of L. helveticus, L. delbrueckii, S. thermophilus and L. fermentum, the developed mRealT-PCR could be used for screening thermophilic starter cultures and to follow the presence of those species during ripening of derived dairy products. A major increase in understanding the starter culture contribution to cheese ecosystem could be harnessed to control cheese ripening and flavor formation.
TI  - Changes in fatty acid profile of feta cheese including conjugated linoleic acid.
AB  - BACKGROUND: During the last two decades much attention has been given to conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) because of its potentially beneficial biological effects. Cheese is one of the major dietary sources of CLA. However, the CLA content of Greek cheeses is variable and affected by many factors. Fatty acid analysis of feta cheese, made of sheep's milk, was conducted at different stages of the manufacturing process in order to monitor and explain fatty acid and especially CLA changes. RESULTS: CLA content in fresh milk and during the early stages of manufacture was 0.66 +/- 0.02 g 100 g(-)(1) fatty acids; it increased during the ripening process (0.75 +/- 0.06 g 100 g(-)(1) fatty acids) and decreased during storage (0.52 +/- 0.15 g 100 g(-)(1) fatty acids). Saturated fatty acids (SFA), increased after 37 and 48 days of aging, while monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), showed the opposite tendency. CONCLUSION: CLA content significantly increased during the ripening stages and decreased during aging (P </= 0.05). CLA is not stable during manufacture and storage of feta cheese, a fact which should be resolved, since this biologically active substance can be obtained from the diet.
TI  - In silico modeling of the type 2 IDI enzymes of Bacillus licheniformis, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus for virtual screening of potential inhibitors of this therapeutic target.
AB  - Isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase is an essential enzyme in those living organisms such as pathogenic strains of Streptococcus and Staphylococcus genera which rely on the Mevalonate pathway for the production of isoprenoids. The pathogens contain type 2 IDI in contrast to human that contains type 1 IDI. Therefore, the type 2 IDI may be a potential target for the therapy of some infectious diseases. In the current study, a virtual screening by docking was performed among 2000 chemicals from CoCoCo library to find a specific inhibitor for type 2 IDIs. To this end, the structures of the type 2 IDIs of Bacillus licheniformis, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus were molded using comparative modeling and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based prediction. The predicted models were evaluated based on Q-mean and Prosa score. Molegro Virtual Docker with MolDock scoring function was used for measuring the binding affinity of the found inhibitor to the active site of the models. Also the inhibition effect of the compound was virtually tested on the crystallography-solved structures of the Sulfolobus shibatae and Thermus thermophilus type 2 IDIs as well as the Escherichia coli type 1 IDI. Finally, the inhibition effect of the found inhibitor was virtually tested on the human type 1 IDI. Interestingly, the results suggest that the inhibitor efficiently binds to and inhibits the bacterial IDIs especially the type 2 IDIs of pathogens while it is not inhibiting the human IDI.
TI  - Effect of Formic Acid on Exopolysaccharide Production in Skim Milk Fermentation by Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus OLL1073R-1.
AB  - In yogurt, the formation of formate by Streptococcus thermophilus stimulates the  activity of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (L. bulgaricus). However, there have been no reports how formic acid acts on the exopolysaccharide (EPS) production of L. bulgaricus. Here, the effect of formate on the EPS production in skim milk by L. bulgaricus OLL1073R-1 was investigated. After incubation for 24 hr with 100 mg/l formate, cell proliferation and lactic acid production were accelerated. The viable and total cell numbers were increased about ten- and four-fold, respectively. The amount of EPS in culture with formate (~116 microg/ml) was also four-fold greater than that of the control (~27 microg/ml). Although elongation of cells was observed at 6 hr of cultivation in both cultures, cells cultivated with formate returned to a normal shape after incubation for 24 hr. The sensitivity to cell wall hydrolase and composition of surface layer proteins, as well as the cell membrane fatty acid composition of L. bulgaricus OLL1073R-1, were not influenced by formate. However, differences were observed in intracellular fatty acid compositions and sensitivity to antibiotics. Cell length and surface damage returned to normal in cultures with formate. These observations suggest that formic acid is necessary for normal cell growth of L. bulgaricus OLL1073R-1 and higher EPS production.
TI  - Biogenic amines formation in Streptococcus thermophilus isolated from home-made natural yogurt.
AB  - Twelve different biogenic amines formation in 58 isolates of Streptococcus thermophilus from home-made natural yogurt were investigated in histidine (HDB) and lysine decarboxylase broth (LDB). All S. thermophilus isolates had an ability to produce twelve different biogenic amines in HDB and LDB. Most of the S. thermophilus isolates formed low amounts of histamine (1-50 mg/L) from histidine. Apart from one isolate, S. thermophilus produced tyramine at low (47 isolates) and medium (10 isolates) levels. The amount of each specific biogenic amine produced by S. thermophilus was generally lower than 100 mg L(-1). Also, the presence of hdcA gene was investigated using PCR technique and relation between gene and histamine production was conducted in S. thermophilus isolates. This study showed that most of the S. thermophilus isolates have the ability to form biogenic amines, especially histamine, and tyramine, which is an important consideration when selecting strains as starter cultures.
TI  - Bacteriophages in food fermentations: new frontiers in a continuous arms race.
AB  - Phage contamination represents an important risk to any process requiring bacterial growth, particularly in the biotechnology and food industries. The presence of unwanted phages may lead to manufacturing delays, lower quality product, or, in the worst cases, total production loss. Thus, constant phage monitoring and stringent application of the appropriate control measures are indispensable. In fact, a systematic preventive approach to phage contamination [phage analysis and critical control points (PACCP)] should be put in place. In this review, sources of phage contamination and novel phage detection methods are described, with an emphasis on bacterial viruses that infect lactic acid bacteria used in food fermentations. Recent discoveries related to antiphage systems that are changing our views on phage-host interactions are highlighted. Finally, future directions are also discussed.
TI  - Isolation and identification of the microbiota of Danish farmhouse and industrially produced surface-ripened cheeses.
AB  - For studying the microbiota of four Danish surface-ripened cheeses produced at three farmhouses and one industrial dairy, both a culture-dependent and culture-independent approach were used. After dereplication of the initial set of 433 isolates by (GTG)5-PCR fingerprinting, 217 bacterial and 25 yeast isolates were identified by sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene or the D1/D2 domain of the 26S rRNA gene, respectively. At the end of ripening, the cheese core microbiota of the farmhouse cheeses consisted of the mesophilic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) starter cultures Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and Leuconostoc mesenteorides as well as non-starter LAB including different Lactobacillus spp. The cheese from the industrial dairy was almost exclusively dominated by Lb. paracasei. The surface bacterial microbiota of all four cheeses were dominated by Corynebacterium spp. and/or Brachybacterium spp. Brevibacterium spp. was found to be subdominant compared to other bacteria on the farmhouse cheeses, and no Brevibacterium spp. was found on the cheese from the industrial dairy, even though B. linens was used as surface-ripening culture. Moreover, Gram-negative bacteria identified as Alcalignes faecalis and Proteus vulgaris were found on one of the farmhouse cheeses. The surface yeast microbiota consisted primarily of one dominating species for each cheese. For the farmhouse cheeses, the dominant yeast species were Yarrowia lipolytica, Geotrichum spp. and Debaryomyces hansenii, respectively, and for the cheese from the industrial dairy, D. hansenii was the dominant yeast species. Additionally, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis revealed that Streptococcus thermophilus was present in the farmhouse raw milk cheese analysed in this study. Furthermore, DGGE bands corresponding to Vagococcus carniphilus, Psychrobacter spp. and Lb. curvatus on the cheese surfaces indicated that these bacterial species may play a role in cheese ripening.
TI  - Selection and characterization of probiotic culture of Streptococcus thermophilus from dahi.
AB  - For the isolation of probiotic cultures of Streptococcus thermophilus from dahi,  we collected 120 samples from the southern regions of Punjab, Pakistan. Eleven isolates were obtained, and six were scrutinized for antibacterial activities against food-borne pathogens. The carbohydrate fermentation profile of these six strains was determined by the API50 CHL system. Additionally, these strains were amplified for their 16S rRNA regions to confirm their genotypic relationship. Furthermore, phenotypic characteristics among these strains were established by S-layer protein analysis of their cell walls by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by plasmid profiling. The outer cell wall layers of these strains have 6-14 different sizes of protein bands of 27, 34, 37, 40, 45 and 60 kDa molecular weight. Similarly, except S02FT, all strains have a single prominent plasmid of 23 kbp, whereas S02FT has an additional plasmid of 9 kbp. On the basis of this unique feature and a wide spectrum of killing patterns against pathogenic bacteria, S. thermophilus S02FT was further characterized. This culture showed an optimum antibacterial activity of 800 AU/ml at pH 5.0-5.5 and a temperature of 30-37 degrees C. It grows well in in vitro acidic conditions and tolerates bile salt up to 2% concentration. It was resistant to nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and sulphamethoxazol, but showed intermediate behaviour to vancomycin and erythromycin.
TI  - SOS response activation and competence development are antagonistic mechanisms in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Streptococcus includes species that either contain or lack the LexA-like repressor (HdiR) of the classical SOS response. In Streptococcus pneumoniae, a species which belongs to the latter group, SOS response inducers (e.g., mitomycin C [Mc] and fluoroquinolones) were shown to induce natural transformation, leading to the hypothesis that DNA damage-induced competence could contribute to genomic plasticity and stress resistance. Using reporter strains and microarray experiments, we investigated the impact of the SOS response inducers mitomycin C and norfloxacin and the role of HdiR on competence development in Streptococcus thermophilus. We show that both the addition of SOS response inducers and HdiR inactivation have a dual effect, i.e., induction of the expression of SOS genes and reduction of transformability. Reduction of transformability results from two different mechanisms, since HdiR inactivation has no major effect on the expression of competence (com) genes, while mitomycin C downregulates the expression of early and late com genes in a dose-dependent manner. The downregulation of com genes by mitomycin C was shown to take place at the level of the activation of the ComRS signaling system by an unknown mechanism. Conversely, we show that a ComX-deficient strain is more resistant to mitomycin C and norfloxacin in a viability plate assay, which indicates that competence development negatively affects the resistance of S. thermophilus to DNA-damaging agents. Altogether, our results strongly suggest that SOS response activation and competence development are antagonistic processes in S. thermophilus.
TI  - Effect of Bifidobacterium bifidum BF-1 on gastric protection and mucin production in an acute gastric injury rat model.
AB  - Homeostasis in the stomach environment is maintained by the balance of protective factors such as gastric mucus and aggressive factors such as gastric acid, stress, alcohol, and drugs. An overload of aggressive factors that upsets this balance can induce gastric injury. Fermented milk that contains Bifidobacterium bifidum BF-1 (BF-1), a probiotic strain, and Streptococcus thermophilus YIT 2021 (ST) is known to improve Helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis in humans. Here, we investigated the gastroprotective potential of BF-1 in a rat model of acid-ethanol-induced acute gastric injury to fully elucidate its potential compared with ST. Living BF-1, ST, or vehicle was orally administrated to rats, and acid-ethanol gastric injury was induced 2h later. The gastric injury rate was determined and shown to be significantly lower in the BF-1 group than in the vehicle group, which showed a similar level to the ST group. The production of gastric mucin and the expression of several target genes associated with protection and inflammation were examined before and after induction of gastric injury. Interestingly, mucin 5ac (muc5ac) gene expression in gastric corpus samples and gastric mucin production in stomach samples from the BF-1 group, but not the ST group, were significantly higher than those in the respective samples from the vehicle group. These findings indicate that BF-1 has the potential to provide gastroprotection, alleviating acute gastric injury by enhancing the production of gastric mucin in a rat model.
TI  - [Investigation of the effects of probiotic bacteria on bacterial translocation that developed during diagnostic laparoscopy: an experimental study].
AB  - Probiotics which are non-pathogenic live microorganisms ingested along with food  or as dietary supplements, are thought to be beneficial to the host by supporting the microbial balance in digestive system. Various studies suggest that the effects of probiotics on the intestinal mucosa and immunity are protective against bacterial translocation. We aimed to investigate bacterial translocation related to the amount of CO2 insufflation given during laparoscopy and the effect of probiotic bacteria in an experimental peritonitis model. In this study 60 Wistar rats were used in six groups consisting of 10 rats. Group 1, 3 and 5 consisted of the rats that were fed without probiotics, while the rats in Group 2, 4, and 6 were fed with water containing 5 x 108 cfu/ml probiotic bacteria complex (Bifidobacterium lactis, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus) for 15 days. To generate experimental peritonitis, 2 x 107 cfu/ml Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 was inoculated intraperitoneally to all of the rats. Thereafter, laparoscopy was applied in all groups. Application in Group 1 and Group 2 was without CO2; Group 3 and Group 4 with 14 mmHg CO2 insufflation, and Group 5 and Group 6 with 20 mmHg CO2 insufflation. Blood samples were taken in 2nd, 4th, and 6th hours. Mesenteric lymph node, liver and spleen samples were taken at 6th hour when the rats were sacrificed and then these were evaluated microbiologically with qualitative and quantitative methods. Bacterial translocation and bacteremia were found in the rats that were undergone experimental peritonitis during laparoscopy. All positive tissue and blood cultures yielded E.coli. The highest level of bacterial translocation was found to be in mesenteric lymph nodes (in 3/10, 6/10 and 10/10 in groups 1, 3 and 5 fed without probiotics, respectively; in 2/10, 3/10 and 4/10 in groups 2, 4 and 6 fed with probiotics, respectively). The bacterial translocation rates were found to be related to the increased CO2 insufflation. It was found that probiotic bacteria were more effective for decreasing bacterial translocation rates and bacteremia in the groups that were given high CO2 pressure during laparoscopy. It was also found that these results were correlated with bacterial translocation per gram of tissue. As an example, the quantitative bacterial growth values detected in mesenteric lymph node were 5.4 +/- 2.9 x 103, 10.6 +/- 3.3 x 103 and 21.5 +/- 12.4 x 103 cfu/g in groups 1, 3 and 5, fed without probiotics, respectively; and 2.0 +/- 1.3 x 103, 3.8 +/- 1.9 x 103 and 9.0 +/- 3.1 x 103 cfu/g in groups 2, 4 and 6, fed with probiotics, respectively. Our data emphasized that probiotic bacteria may be used as prophylactic agents for the prevention of bacterial translocation during laparoscopy, however comprehensive and clinical studies are needed to support these experimental results.
TI  - Effect of daily consumption of probiotic yoghurt on insulin resistance in pregnant women: a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Owing to excess body weight and increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines primarily during the third trimester, pregnancy is associated with elevated insulin resistance. To our knowledge, no report is available indicating the effects of probiotic yoghurt consumption on serum insulin levels in pregnant women. This study was designed to determine the effects of daily consumption of probiotic yoghurt on insulin resistance and serum insulin levels of Iranian pregnant women. SUBJECTS/METHODS: In this randomized controlled clinical trial, 70 primigravida pregnant women with singleton pregnancy at their third trimester were participated. We randomly assigned participants to consume 200 g per day of conventional (n=33) or the probiotic group (n=37) for 9 weeks. The probiotic yoghurt was a commercially available product prepared with the starter cultures of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus, enriched with probiotic culture of two strains of lactobacilli (Lactobacillus acidophilus LA5) and bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium animalis BB12) with a total of min 1 x 10(7) colony-forming units. Fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and after 9-week intervention to measure fasting plasma glucose and serum insulin levels. Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was used to calculate insulin resistance score. RESULTS: Although consumption of probiotic yogurt for 9 weeks did not affect serum insulin levels and HOMA-IR score, significant differences were found comparing changes in these variables between probiotic and conventional yogurts (changes from baseline in serum insulin levels: +1.2+/-1.2 vs +5.0+/-1.1 muIU/ml, respectively, P=0.02; and in HOMA-IR score: -0.2+/-0.3 vs 0.7+/-0.2, respectively, P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that in contrast to conventional yogurt, daily consumption of probiotic yogurt for 9 weeks maintains serum insulin levels and might help pregnant women prevent developing insulin resistance.
TI  - BlpC-regulated bacteriocin production in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus B59671 produces a bacteriocin with anti-pediococcal activity, but genes required for its production are not characterized. Genome sequencing of S. thermophilus has identified a genetic locus encoding a quorum sensing (QS) system that regulates production of class II bacteriocins. However, in strains possessing this gene cluster, production of bacteriocin like peptides (Blp) was only observed when excess pheromone was provided. PCR analysis revealed this strain possessed blpC, which encodes the 30-mer QS pheromone. To investigate if BlpC regulates bacteriocin production in S. thermophilus B59671, an integrative vector was used to replace blpC with a gene encoding for kanamycin resistance and the resulting mutant did not inhibit the growth of Pediococcus acidilactici. Constitutive expression of blpC from a shuttle vector restored the bacteriocin production, confirming the blp gene cluster is essential for bacteriocin activity in S. thermophilus B59671.
TI  - Structural aspects of the interaction of dairy phages with their host bacteria.
AB  - Knowledge of phage-host interactions at a fundamental level is central to the design of rational strategies for the development of phage-resistant strains that may be applied in industrial settings. Phages infecting lactic acid bacteria, in particular Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus, negatively impact on dairy fermentation processes with serious economic implications. In recent years a wealth of information on structural protein assembly and topology has become available relating to phages infecting Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Lactococcus lactis, which act as models for structural analyses of dairy phages. In this review, we explore the role of model tailed phages, such as T4 and SPP1, in advancing our knowledge regarding interactions between dairy phages and their hosts. Furthermore, the potential of currently investigated dairy phages to in turn serve as model systems for this particular group of phages is discussed.
TI  - Macedovicin, the second food-grade lantibiotic produced by Streptococcus macedonicus ACA-DC 198.
AB  - Streptococcus macedonicus ACA-DC 198 was found to produce a second lantibiotic named macedovicin in addition to macedocin. Macedovicin was purified to homogeneity and mass spectrometric analysis identified a peptide of approximately 3.4 kDa. Partial N-terminal sequence analysis and tandem mass spectrometry revealed that macedovicin was identical to bovicin HJ50 and thermophilin 1277 produced by Streptococcus bovis and Streptococcus thermophilus, respectively. Macedovicin inhibits a broad spectrum of lactic acid bacteria, several food spoilage species (e.g. Clostridium spp.) and oral streptococci. We determined the complete biosynthetic gene cluster of macedovicin. Even though the gene clusters of macedovicin, thermophilin 1277 and bovicin HJ50 were almost identical at the nucleotide level, there were important differences in their predicted genes and proteins. Bovicin HJ50-like lantibiotics were also found to be encoded by Streptococcus suis strains SC84 and D12, Enterococcus columbae PLCH2, Clostridium perfringens JGS1721 and several Bacillus strains. All these lantibiotics contained a number of conserved amino acids that may be important for their biosynthesis and activity, while phylogenetic analysis supported their dispersion by horizontal gene transfer. In conclusion, the production of multiple bacteriocins may enhance the bio-protective potential of S. macedonicus during food fermentation.
TI  - The susceptibility of Streptococcus thermophilus 14085 to organic acid, simulated gastric juice, bile salt and disinfectant as influenced by cold shock treatment.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus is a thermophilic lactic acid bacterium which is used  as the starter organism for the fermentation of yoghurt and some cheese. In the present study, S. thermophilus BCRC 14085 was subjected to cold shock treatment by exposure at 10 degrees C for 2 h. The effect of cold shock on the susceptibility of S. thermophilus in subsequent lethal stress environments such as simulated gastric juice (pH 2.0-3.0), bile solution (2.0%) and various organic acids (0.75 M, pH 3.5) including propionic, lactic, acetic, citric and tartaric acid was investigated. In addition, the survival of cold-shocked and non-shocked S. thermophilus exposed to disinfectants, Clidox-S and Quatricide, were compared. Results revealed that cold shock enhanced the tolerance of S. thermophilus in the presence of simulated gastric juice (pH 2.5 and 2.8), while in bile solution, the population increase of cold-shocked cells is higher than that of non-shocked cells after 12 h of incubation. Furthermore, the susceptibility of S. thermophilus, regardless of cold shock, to organic acid varied with the kinds of organic acid examined. The cold-shocked S. thermophilus showed a significantly less survival (P < 0.05) than that of the non-shocked cells when exposed to lactic or acetic acid. Furthermore, cold shock reduced the survival of S. thermophilus when exposed to Quatricide but not Clidox-S.
TI  - Analysis of microbial diversity on deli slicers using polymerase chain reaction and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis technologies.
AB  - Cross-contamination of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria from food-contact surfaces to food products is a serious public health issue. Bacteria may survive and attach to food-contact surfaces by residual food components and/or background bacteria which may subsequently transfer to other food products. Deli slicers, generally used for slicing ready-to-eat products, can serve as potential sources for considerable bacterial transfer. The objective of this study was to assess the extent and distribution of microbial diversity of deli slicers by identification of pathogenic and background bacteria. Slicer-swab samples were collected from restaurants in Arkansas and Texas in the United States. Ten surface areas for each slicer were swabbed using sterile sponges. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was applied to investigate the fingerprint of samples, and each band was further identified by sequence analysis. Pseudomonads were identified as the dominant bacteria followed by Enterobacteriaceae family, and lactic acid bacteria such as Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus were also found. Bacterial distribution was similar for all surface areas, while the blade guard exhibited the greatest diversity. This study provides a profile of the microbial ecology of slicers using DGGE to develop more specific sanitation practices and to reduce cross-contamination during slicing.
TI  - Viability and activity of bifidobacteria during refrigerated storage of yoghurt containing Mangifera pajang fibrous polysaccharides.
AB  - The viability and activity of Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum G4, B. longum BB  536 and yoghurt cultures (Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus) were studied in yoghurt containing 0.75% Mangefira pajang fibrous polysaccharides (MPFP) and inulin. Growth of probiotic organisms, their proteolytic activities, the production of short chain fatty acids (lactic, acetic and propionic) and the pH of the yoghurt samples were determined during refrigerated storage at 4 degrees C for 28 d. B. pseudocatenulatum G4 and B. longum BB 536 showed better growth and activity in the presence of MPFP and inulin, which significantly increased the production of short chain fatty acids as well as the proteolytic activity of these organisms. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This is the first study reported on produce synbiotic yoghurt as a functional food for specified health uses contains bifidobacteria and M. pajang fibrous polysaccharides. M. pajang fibrous polysaccharides can be used as a prebiotic particularly in dairy products to increase the viability and activity of bifidobacteria which can be used as probiotic to exert health benefit to the human by yoghurt that is considered common use in society; thus, the benefits of synbiotic yoghurt are readily accessible to the member of society.
TI  - Phages of lactic acid bacteria: the role of genetics in understanding phage-host  interactions and their co-evolutionary processes.
AB  - Dairy fermentations are among the oldest food processing applications, aimed at preservation and shelf-life extension through the use of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) starter cultures, in particular strains of Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus spp. and Leuconostoc spp. Traditionally this was performed by continuous passaging of undefined cultures from a finished fermentation to initiate the next fermentation. More recently, consumer demands on consistent and desired flavours and textures of dairy products have led to a more defined approach to such processes. Dairy (starter) companies have responded to the need to define the nature and complexity of the starter culture mixes, and dairy fermentations are now frequently based on defined starter cultures of low complexity, where each starter component imparts specific technological properties that are desirable to the product. Both mixed and defined starter culture approaches create the perfect environment for the proliferation of (bacterio)phages capable of infecting these LAB. The repeated use of the same starter cultures in a single plant, coupled to the drive towards higher and consistent production levels, increases the risk and negative impact of phage infection. In this review we will discuss recent advances in tracking the adaptation of phages to the dairy industry, the advances in understanding LAB phage-host interactions, including evolutionary and genomic aspects.
TI  - Phage mutations in response to CRISPR diversification in a bacterial population.
AB  - Interactions between bacteria and their coexisting phage populations impact evolution and can strongly influence biogeochemical processes in natural ecosystems. Periodically, mutation or migration results in exposure of a host to a phage to which it has no immunity; alternatively, a phage may be exposed to a host it cannot infect. To explore the processes by which coexisting, co-evolving hosts and phage populations establish, we cultured Streptococcus thermophilus DGCC7710 with phage 2972 and tracked CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) diversification and host-phage co-evolution in a population derived from a colony that acquired initial CRISPR-encoded immunity. After 1 week of co-culturing, the coexisting host-phage populations were metagenomically characterized using 454 FLX Titanium sequencing. The evolved genomes were compared with reference genomes to identify newly incorporated spacers in S. thermophilus DGCC7710 and recently acquired single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in phage 2972. Following phage exposure, acquisition of immune elements (spacers) led to a genetically diverse population with multiple subdominant strain lineages. Phage mutations that circumvented three early immunization events were localized in the proto-spacer adjacent motif (PAM) or near the PAM end of the proto-spacer, suggesting a strong selective advantage for the phage that mutated in this region. The sequential fixation or near fixation of these single mutations indicates selection events so severe that single phage genotypes ultimately gave rise to all surviving lineages and potentially carried traits unrelated to immunity to fixation.
TI  - [Analysis on the antimicrobial resistance of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the yogurt sold in China].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the antimicrobial susceptibility of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from yogurt, and to provide references for evaluating the safety of LAB and screening safe strains. METHODS: The sensitivity of 43 LAB strains, including 14 strains of Streptococcus thermophilus, 12 strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus, 9 strains of Lactobacillus bulgaricus and 8 strains of Bifidobacterium, to 22 antibiotics were tested by agar plate dilution method. RESULTS: All 43 LAB strains were resistant to trimethoprim, nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, danofloxacin and polymyxin E. Their resistances to kanamycin, tetracycline, clindamycin, doxycycline and cephalothin were varied. The sensitivity to other antibiotics were sensitive or moderate. All isolates were multidrug-resistant. CONCLUSION: The antimicrobial resistance of tested LAB strains was comparatively serious, and continuously monitoring their antimicrobial resistance and evaluating their safety should be strengthened.
TI  - Occurrence and evolution of the paralogous zinc metalloproteases IgA1 protease, ZmpB, ZmpC, and ZmpD in Streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species.
AB  - The distribution, genome location, and evolution of the four paralogous zinc metalloproteases, IgA1 protease, ZmpB, ZmpC, and ZmpD, in Streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species were studied by in silico analysis of whole genomes and by activity screening of 154 representatives of 20 species. ZmpB was ubiquitous in the Mitis and Salivarius groups of the genus Streptococcus and in the genera Gemella and Granulicatella, with the exception of a fragmented gene in Streptococcus thermophilus, the only species with a nonhuman habitat. IgA1 protease activity was observed in all members of S. pneumoniae, S. pseudopneumoniae, S. oralis, S. sanguinis, and Gemella haemolysans, was variably present in S. mitis and S. infantis, and absent in S. gordonii, S. parasanguinis, S. cristatus, S. oligofermentans, S. australis, S. peroris, and S. suis. Phylogenetic analysis of 297 zmp sequences and representative housekeeping genes provided evidence for an unprecedented selection for genetic diversification of the iga, zmpB, and zmpD genes in S. pneumoniae and evidence of very frequent intraspecies transfer of entire genes and combination of genes. Presumably due to their adaptation to a commensal lifestyle, largely unaffected by adaptive mucosal immune factors, the corresponding genes in commensal streptococci have remained conserved. The widespread distribution and significant sequence diversity indicate an ancient origin of the zinc metalloproteases predating the emergence of the humanoid species. zmpB, which appears to be the ancestral gene, subsequently duplicated and successfully diversified into distinct functions, is likely to serve an important but yet unknown housekeeping function associated with the human host. IMPORTANCE: The paralogous zinc metalloproteases IgA1 protease, ZmpB, ZmpC, and ZmpD have been identified as crucial for virulence of the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. This study maps the presence of the corresponding genes and enzyme activities in S. pneumoniae and in related commensal species of the genera Streptococcus, Gemella, and Granulicatella. The distribution, genome location, and sequence diversification indicate that zmpB is the ancestral gene predating the evolution of today's humanoid species. The ZmpB protease may play an important but yet unidentified role in the association of streptococci of the Mitis and Salivarius groups with their human host, as it is ubiquitous in these two groups, except for a fragmented gene in Streptococcus thermophilus, the only species not associated with humans. The relative sequence diversification of the IgA1 protease, ZmpB, and ZmpD is striking evidence of differences in selection for diversification of these surface-exposed proteins in the pathogen S. pneumoniae compared to the closely related commensal streptococci.
TI  - The effect of probiotic-fermented soy milk on enhancing the NO-mediated vascular  relaxation factors.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Soy milk is one of the common soy-based foods in Asia. In this study  the effects of soy milk fermented with selected probiotics on nitric oxide (NO)-mediated vascular relaxation factors in cell model systems were investigated. RESULTS: Soy milk fermented with Lactobacillus plantarum TWK10 or Streptococcus thermophilus BCRC 14085 for 48 h showed a greater transformation of glucoside isoflavones to aglycone isoflavones (P < 0.05). An increase in aglycone isoflavones in ethanol extracts from fermented soy milk stimulated NO production and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) activity in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. It also had a stimulating effect on superoxide anion scavenging and prostaglandin E(2) production. In addition, it enhanced mRNA expression of the E-prostanoid 4 receptor in rat thoracic aorta smooth muscle cells. Moreover, a small amount of O(2)(-) induced by water extracts from fermented soy milk at low concentration (1 mg mL(-)(1)) increased the content of calcium ions and activated eNOS, thereby promoting NO production and the coupling state of eNOS. CONCLUSION: Soy milk fermented with selected probiotics promotes the relaxation factors of vascular endothelial cells and can be applied in the development of functional foods.
TI  - Fatty acid profile, trans-octadecenoic, alpha-linolenic and conjugated linoleic acid contents differing in certified organic and conventional probiotic fermented milks.
AB  - Development of dairy organic probiotic fermented products is of great interest as they associate ecological practices and benefits of probiotic bacteria. As organic management practices of cow milk production allow modification of the fatty acid composition of milk (as compared to conventional milk), we studied the influence of the type of milk on some characteristics of fermented milks, such as acidification kinetics, bacterial counts and fatty acid content. Conventional and organic probiotic fermented milks were produced using Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis HN019 in co-culture with Streptococcus thermophilus TA040 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus LB340. The use of organic milk led to a higher acidification rate and cultivability of Lactobacillus bulgaricus. Fatty acids profile of organic fermented milks showed higher amounts of trans-octadecenoic acid (C18:1, 1.6 times) and polyunsaturated fatty acids, including cis-9 trans-11, C18:2 conjugated linoleic (CLA-1.4 times), and alpha-linolenic acids (ALA-1.6 times), as compared to conventional fermented milks. These higher levels were the result of both initial percentage in the milk and increase during acidification, with no further modification during storage. Finally, use of bifidobacteria slightly increased CLA relative content in the conventional fermented milks, after 7 days of storage at 4 degrees C, whereas no difference was seen in organic fermented milks.
TI  - Supplementation of infant formula with probiotics/prebiotics: lessons learned with regard to documenting outcomes.
AB  - In 2011, the Committee on Nutrition of the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition systematically reviewed published evidence on the safety and health effects of the administration of formulae supplemented with probiotics and/or prebiotics compared with unsupplemented formulae. The document could serve as an example of problems relating to the choice and definition of outcomes assessing the addition of new ingredients to infant formulae. The studies were often too small with insufficient power to identify relevant effects, and the follow-up periods in the trials were too short. The clinical outcomes, even those relating to the same domain (eg, gastrointestinal infections) differed. Even if the same outcomes were measured, the definitions of the outcomes were heterogenous, often not widely agreed upon, or just lacking. The use of inappropriate outcome measures and/or their definitions may result in misleading conclusions. It may also lead to an overestimation or underestimation of potential benefits of the intervention or fail to reveal any potential benefits. There is a need for well-designed and carefully conducted randomized controlled trials, with relevant inclusion/exclusion criteria and adequate sample sizes. These studies should use validated clinical outcome measures.
TI  - Growth advantage of Streptococcus thermophilus over Lactobacillus bulgaricus in vitro and in the gastrointestinal tract of gnotobiotic rats.
AB  - The yoghurt bacteria, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, are alleged to have beneficial effects on human health. The objective of this study was to characterise growth, biochemical activity and competitive behaviour of these two bacteria in vitro and in vivo. S. thermophilus LMD-9 and L. bulgaricus ATCC 11842 growth and lactate production were monitored in different media and in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of germ-free rats. In vitro, particularly in milk, S. thermophilus had a selective growth advantage over L. bulgaricus. The GIT of germ-free rats not supplemented with lactose was colonised by S. thermophilus but not by L. bulgaricus. Both bacteria were able to colonise the GIT of germ-free rats supplemented with 45 g/l lactose in their drinking water. However, if germ-free rats were inoculated with a mixture of the two bacteria and were supplemented with lactose, S. thermophilus rapidly and extensively colonised the GIT (1010 cfu/g faeces) at the expense of L. bulgaricus, which remained in most cases at levels <102 cfu/g faeces. S. thermophilus specifically produced L-lactate, while L. bulgaricus produced only D-lactate, both in vitro and in vivo. S. thermophilus showed competitive and growth advantage over L. bulgaricus in vitro as well as in vivo in the GIT of germ-free rats and, accordingly, L-lactate was the main lactate isomer produced.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria isolated from cheeses and yogurts.
AB  - The biopreservation of foods using bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated directly from foods is an innovative approach. The objectives of this study were to isolate and identify bacteriocinogenic LAB from various cheeses and yogurts and evaluate their antimicrobial effects on selected spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms in vitro as well as on a food commodity.LAB were isolated using MRS and M17 media. The agar diffusion bioassay was used to screen for bacteriocin or bacteriocin-like substances (BLS) producing LAB using Lactobacillus sakei and Listeria innocua as indicator organisms. Out of 138 LAB isolates, 28 were found to inhibit these bacteria and were identified as strains of Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Eight isolates were tested for antimicrobial activity at 5 degrees C and 20 degrees C against L. innocua, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Erwinia carotovora, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides using the agar diffusion bioassay, and also against Penicillium expansum, Botrytis cinerea and Monilinia frucitcola using the microdilution plate method. The effect of selected LAB strains on L. innocua inoculated onto fresh-cut onions was also investigated.Twenty percent of our isolates produced BLS inhibiting the growth of L. innocua and/or Lact. sakei. Organic acids and/or H2O2 produced by LAB and not the BLS had strong antimicrobial effects on all microorganisms tested with the exception of E. coli. Ent. faecium, Strep. thermophilus and Lact. casei effectively inhibited the growth of natural microflora and L. innocua inoculated onto fresh-cut onions. Bacteriocinogenic LAB present in cheeses and yogurts may have potential to be used as biopreservatives in foods.
TI  - In vivo study of the survival of Lactobacillus delbruecki subsp. bulgaricus CECT  4005T and Streptococcus thermophilus CECT 801 by DVC-FISH after consumption of fermented milk.
AB  - Direct Viable Count (DVC) method has been recently combined with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for the specific detection of viable cells of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CECT 4005T and Streptococcus thermophilus CECT 801. This method has been used to determine their in vitro viability to gastrointestinal juices, being the resistance of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus 26.2% and 9.2%, respectively. On the other hand, an in vivo study has been carried out with the application of this technique for their detection in human feces, after consuming fermented milk. Cells of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CECT 4005T were not detected, whereas viable cells of S. thermophilus CECT 801 were detected in a number higher than 10(3) cells per gram in a 30% of the samples after 4 wk of consumption. DVC-FISH is a quick and culture-independent useful method, which has been applied for the 1st time in an in vivo survival study of LAB.
TI  - Cas9-crRNA ribonucleoprotein complex mediates specific DNA cleavage for adaptive  immunity in bacteria.
AB  - Clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) systems provide adaptive immunity against viruses and plasmids in bacteria and archaea. The silencing of invading nucleic acids is executed by ribonucleoprotein complexes preloaded with small, interfering CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) that act as guides for targeting and degradation of foreign nucleic acid. Here, we demonstrate that the Cas9-crRNA complex of the Streptococcus thermophilus CRISPR3/Cas system introduces in vitro a double-strand break at a specific site in DNA containing a sequence complementary to crRNA. DNA cleavage is executed by Cas9, which uses two distinct active sites, RuvC and HNH, to generate site-specific nicks on opposite DNA strands. Results demonstrate that the Cas9-crRNA complex functions as an RNA-guided endonuclease with RNA-directed target sequence recognition and protein-mediated DNA cleavage. These findings pave the way for engineering of universal programmable RNA-guided DNA endonucleases.
TI  - The double-edged sword of CRISPR-Cas systems.
AB  - A recent paper gives the details on how specific small RNAs can program a protein to cleave an undesired piece of DNA and to provide immunity to a microbial cell.
TI  - Exopolysaccharides modify functional properties of whey protein concentrate.
AB  - The objective of this research was to produce whey protein concentrate (WPC) with modified functionality using exopolysaccharide- (EPS) producing cultures. Two different EPS-producing cultures, Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris JFR and Streptococcus thermophilus, producing EPS1 and EPS2 respectively, were used in this study. One EPS-nonproducing commercial cheese culture (DVS 850; Chr. Hansen, Milwaukee, WI) was used as the control. Reconstituted sweet whey powder was used in this study to eliminate variations from fresh whey. Cultures grown overnight in reconstituted WPC (10% wt/vol) were added, directly or after overnight cooling (cooled EPS), at 2% (wt/vol) to 6% (wt/wt) solution of reconstituted whey. Whey was then high-temperature, short-time pasteurized at 75 degrees C for 35s and ultrafiltered to a volume reduction factor of 5. Ultrafiltered whey (retentate) was spray dried at inlet and outlet air temperatures of 200 and 90 degrees C, respectively, to obtain WPC. In general, the solubility of WPC was higher at pH 7 than at pH 3. Whey protein concentrate containing EPS2 exhibited higher protein solubility than did WPC containing no EPS. Also, the presence of EPS in WPC decreased protein denaturation. The emulsifying ability of WPC containing EPS was higher than that in control. Addition of EPS to WPC significantly enhanced its gelling ability. Foam overrun and hydrophobicity of WPC were not affected by addition of EPS. In conclusion, data obtained from this study show that EPS modify WPC functionality. The extent of modification depends on the type of EPS. Cooling of culture containing EPS before its addition to whey further reduced WPC protein denaturation and increased its solubility at pH 7 and gel hardness.
TI  - Protein domain repetition is enriched in Streptococcal cell-surface proteins.
AB  - Tandem repetition of domain in protein sequence occurs in all three domains of life. It creates protein diversity and adds functional complexity in organisms. In this work, we analyzed 52 streptococcal genomes and found 3748 proteins contained domain repeats. Proteins not harboring domain repeats are significantly enriched in cytoplasm, whereas proteins with domain repeats are significantly enriched in cytoplasmic membrane, cell wall and extracellular locations. Domain repetition occurs most frequently in S. pneumoniae and least in S. thermophilus and S. pyogenes. DUF1542 is the highest repeated domain in a single protein, followed by Rib, CW_binding_1, G5 and HemolysinCabind. 3D structures of 24 repeat-containing proteins were predicted to investigate the structural and functional effect of domain repetition. Several repeat-containing streptococcal cell surface proteins are known to be virulence-associated. Surface-associated tandem domain-containing proteins without experimental functional characterization may be potentially involved in the pathogenesis of streptococci and deserve further investigation.
TI  - Technical note: development of a quantitative PCR method for monitoring strain dynamics during yogurt manufacture.
AB  - Yogurt starter cultures may consist of multiple strains of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (LB) and Streptococcus thermophilus (ST). Conventional plating methods for monitoring LB and ST levels during yogurt manufacture do not allow for quantification of individual strains. The objective of the present work was to develop a quantitative PCR method for quantification of individual strains in a commercial yogurt starter culture. Strain-specific primers were designed for 2 ST strains (ST DGCC7796 and ST DGCC7710), 1 LB strain (DGCC4078), and 1 Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. lactis strain (LL; DGCC4550). Primers for the individual ST and LB strains were designed to target unique DNA sequences in clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats. Primers for LL were designed to target a putative mannitol-specific IIbC component of the phosphotransferase system. Following evaluation of primer specificity, standard curves relating cell number to cycle threshold were prepared for each strain individually and in combination in yogurt mix, and no significant differences in the slopes were observed. Strain balance data was collected for yogurt prepared at 41 and 43 degrees C to demonstrate the potential application of this method.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Chinese yogurts.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the susceptibility of 43 strains of lactic  acid bacteria, isolated from Chinese yogurts made in different geographical areas, to 11 antibiotics (ampicillin, penicillin G, roxithromycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, chlortetracycline, lincomycin, kanamycin, streptomycin, neomycin, and gentamycin). The 43 isolates (18 Lactobacillus bulgaricus and 25 Streptococcus thermophilus) were identified at species level and were typed by random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis. Thirty-five genotypically different strains were detected and their antimicrobial resistance to 11 antibiotics was determined using the agar dilution method. Widespread resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, chlortetracycline, tetracyclines, lincomycin, streptomycin, neomycin, and gentamycin was found among the 35 strains tested. All of the Strep. thermophilus strains tested were susceptible to penicillin G and roxithromycin, whereas 23.5 and 64.7% of Lb. bulgaricus strains, respectively, were resistant. All of the Strep. thermophilus and Lb. bulgaricus strains were found to be resistant to kanamycin. The presence of the corresponding resistance genes in the resistant isolates was investigated through PCR, with the following genes detected: tet(M) in 1 Lb. bulgaricus and 2 Strep. thermophilus isolates, ant(6) in 2 Lb. bulgaricus and 2 Strep. thermophilus isolates, and aph(3')-IIIa in 5 Lb. bulgaricus and 2 Strep. thermophilus isolates. The main threat associated with these bacteria is that they may transfer resistance genes to pathogenic bacteria, which has been a major cause of concern to human and animal health. To our knowledge, the aph(3')-IIIa and ant(6) genes were found in Lb. bulgaricus and Strep. thermophilus for the first time. Further investigations are required to analyze whether the genes identified in Lb. bulgaricus and Strep. thermophilus isolates might be horizontally transferred to other species.
TI  - The effect of NaCl substitution with KCl on Akawi cheese: chemical composition, proteolysis, angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitory activity, probiotic survival, texture profile, and sensory properties.
AB  - The effect of partial substitution of NaCl with KCl on Akawi cheese with probiotic bacteria was investigated during 30 d of storage at 4 degrees C. Chemical composition, the survival of probiotic and lactic acid bacteria, proteolytic activity, and texture profile analysis were analyzed and sensory analysis was carried out to determine the effects of substitution. No significant differences were observed in moisture, protein, fat, and ash contents among the experimental Akawi cheeses at the same storage period. Significant differences were observed in water-soluble nitrogen and phosphotungstic-soluble nitrogen between experimental cheeses at the same of storage period. No significant difference was observed in the growth of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus between experimental cheeses at the same storage period. However, the growth of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus was significantly affected among experimental cheeses. A significant difference was observed in soluble Ca among experimental cheeses at the same storage period. In general, no significant differences existed in hardness and adhesiveness among experimental cheeses at the same storage period. No significant differences existed in sensory attributes, including creaminess, bitterness, saltiness, sour-acid, and vinegar taste among experimental Akawi cheeses at the same storage period.
TI  - Cleavage of phage DNA by the Streptococcus thermophilus CRISPR3-Cas system.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus, similar to other Bacteria and Archaea, has developed  defense mechanisms to protect cells against invasion by foreign nucleic acids, such as virus infections and plasmid transformations. One defense system recently described in these organisms is the CRISPR-Cas system (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats loci coupled to CRISPR-associated genes). Two S. thermophilus CRISPR-Cas systems, CRISPR1-Cas and CRISPR3-Cas, have been shown to actively block phage infection. The CRISPR1-Cas system interferes by cleaving foreign dsDNA entering the cell in a length-specific and orientation-dependant manner. Here, we show that the S. thermophilus CRISPR3-Cas system acts by cleaving phage dsDNA genomes at the same specific position inside the targeted protospacer as observed with the CRISPR1-Cas system. Only one cleavage site was observed in all tested strains. Moreover, we observed that the CRISPR1-Cas and CRISPR3-Cas systems are compatible and, when both systems are present within the same cell, provide increased resistance against phage infection by both cleaving the invading dsDNA. We also determined that overall phage resistance efficiency is correlated to the total number of newly acquired spacers in both CRISPR loci.
TI  - Lactic acid production by Streptococcus thermophilus alters Clostridium difficile infection and in vitro Toxin A production.
AB  - Antibiotic treatment to treat specific infections has the potential to effectively target the offending microbe as well as other microbes that colonize sites within a host. Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) is a classic example resulting from disruption of host microbial communities; 20% of patients with AAD are likely to become colonized with Clostridium difficile. Restoration of a "normal" microbial community within the host using probiotic bacteria is one approach to circumvent AAD and C. difficile infection. The goals of this study were to assess the interactions between Streptococcus thermophilus, a potential probiotic organism and C. difficile using both in vitro and in vivo systems. Exposure of C. difficile to filtered supernatants from S. thermophilus showed a dose-dependent, bactericidal effect due to lactic acid. Additional studies show that levels of lactic acid (10 mM) that did not inhibit bacterial growth had the potential to decrease tcdA expression and TcdA release into the extracellular milieu. In vivo, treatment with viable S. thermophilus significantly increased luminal levels of lactate in the cecum compared with UV-irradiated S. thermophilus. In the context of infection with C. difficile, mice treated with viable S. thermophilus exhibited 46% less weight loss compared with untreated controls; moreover, less pathology, diarrhea, and lower detectable toxin levels in cecal contents were evident more often in S. thermophillus treated mice. A significant, inverse correlation (Spearman r = -0.942, p = 0.017) between the levels of luminal lactate and abundance of C. difficile were noted suggesting that lactate produced by S. thermophilus is a factor impacting the progression of C. difficile infection in the murine system.
TI  - [The influence of probiotic fermented milk product on colon microbiota, hematological parameters and cell immunity in rats].
AB  - Influence of probiotic fermented milk product on the intestinal microbiota, hematological parameters and immune status of the experiment in vivo at Wistar rats was studied. It was shown, that entering of probiotic strains of Bifidobacterium bifidum 791, Bifidobacterium longum B-379M and Lactobacillus acidophilus NK1 u Streptococcus thermophilus in composition fermented milk products in the total quantity of 2,1 x 10(7) CFU/ sm3 in digestive tract within three weeks has a positive influence on the resident of colon microbiota. Significant increasing of population levels of Bifidobacterium, Enterobacteriaceae with normal biochemical properties, registered a strong tendency to increase the content of Lactobacteria, which led to a decreasing the number of potential pathogenic transient flora with pathogenic factors. Monitoring of body mass in experimental animals has shown that including of fermented milk product with probiotic strains in diet has a positive influence on the feed uptake. Probiotic properties of the product also have stimulated effect on the immune status of the rat: improvements in cell immunity (increasing the relative amount of T-helper cells, immuneregulatory index) and hematological parameters (increase
TI  - Stimulation of cadaverine production by foodborne pathogens in the presence of Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, and Streptococcus spp.
AB  - The effect of Lactobacillus plantarum (FI8595), Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG 1363), Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (IL 1403), and Streptococcus thermophilus on cadaverine and other biogenic amine production by foodborne pathogens was investigated lysine decarboxylase broth. Both of lactic acid bacteria and foodborne pathogens used (especially Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, Lc. lactis subsp. lactis and Lb. plantarum) had an ability to convert aminoacids into biogenic amine. The conversion of lysine into cadaverine was the highest (167.11 mg/L) by Lactobacillus spp. Gram-positive bacteria generally had a greater ability to produce cadaverine with corresponding value of 46.26, 53.76, and 154.54 mg/L for Enterococcus faecalis, S. aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes, respectively. Significant variations on biogenic amine production were observed in the presence of lactic acid bacteria strains (P < 0.05). The role of lactic acid bacteria on biogenic amine production by foodborne pathogens varied depending on strains and specific amine. Cadaverine accumulation by Enterobactericeae was increased in the presence of lactic acid bacteria strains except for St. thermophilus, which induced 2-fold lower cadaverine production by S. Paratyphi A. Lc. lactis subsp. lactis and Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris induced 10-fold higher increases in histamine for E. coli and K. pneumoniae, respectively. Lactic acid bacteria resulted in strong increases in cadaverine production by P. aeruginosa, although remarkable decreases were observed for histamine, spermidine, dopamine, agmatine, and TMA in the presence of lactic acid bacteria in lysine decarboxylase broth . The result of the study showed that amine positive lactic acid bacteria strains in fermented food led to significant amine accumulation by contaminant bacteria and their accumulation in food product may be controlled by the use of proper starters with amine-negative activity.
TI  - Complete genome sequence of Streptococcus thermophilus strain MN-ZLW-002.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus MN-ZLW-002 was originally isolated from traditionally  fermented Chinese dairy products. One of the strain-dependent characteristics of this bacterium is its ability to produce exopolysaccharides (EPSs). This study determined and analyzed the genome sequence of MN-ZLW-002. Its complete genome comprised 2,046 genes and 1,848,520 nucleotides with an average GC content of 39%. The EPS cluster of MN-ZLW-002 includes 25 open reading frames (ORFs), and some results indicate a horizontal gene transfer between MN-ZLW-002 and other lactic acid bacteria (LAB).
TI  - A POTluck of peptide transporters.
AB  
TI  - Human monocyte-derived dendritic cells from leukoreduction system chambers after  plateletpheresis are functional in an in vitro co-culture assay with intestinal epithelial cells.
AB  - The dendritic cells (DC) found in the intestine are involved both in the maintenance of tolerance towards commensal microbiota, and in the generation of protective immune responses against pathogens, thus contributing to gut immune homeostasis. There is an increasing interest in the use of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as probiotics; among their beneficial effects we highlight the modulation of the immune system which is one of their fundamental properties. As these effects are strain-dependent, it is important to have in vitro systems that include DC and intestinal epithelial cells (IEC), which are crucial for intestinal homeostasis, to identify candidates by means of bacterial screening. Obtaining enough human cells, necessary to simultaneously test several bacteria, is a major challenge for researchers. In this study we analyzed the usefulness of the cellular fraction retained in leukoreduction system chambers following plateletpheresis (PP) as a source of DC. We compared the capacity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from buffy coats (BC) or PP to generate DC using a short differentiation protocol. The functionality of the DC obtained was analyzed in co-cultures together with intestinal epithelial HT-29 cells, stimulating with LPS alone or with two LAB commonly used in the food industry, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii. DC surface markers CD86, HLA-DR and cytokine production were measured. The behavior of DC derived from PP was similar to the behavior observed for DC derived from BC. When we tested the response of DC to bacteria, we found significant differences in cytokine secretion, especially for IL-10, suggesting that the system has the ability to discriminate LAB with different immunomodulatory properties. We also found that DC derived from both sources displayed a similar ability to phagocyte bacteria. In conclusion, we hereby propose a modification of the two-day protocol for obtaining human DC previously described, using PP as an alternative source of PBMC, to be used in co-culture systems with IEC. The novelty of this protocol is the combination of the blood monocyte source with a simple and fast differentiation method to obtain DC, and their use in a combined culture with IEC and LAB to model microbial-host interaction. Since the initial PP volume is ten times lower than that of BC, the use of PP minimizes biological residue generation and reagent consumption. In addition, monocyte-derived DC from PP were suitable for use in co-culture assays as a first screening step to study the immunomodulatory properties of LAB.
TI  - Incorporation of Lactobacillus casei in Iranian ultrafiltered Feta cheese made by partial replacement of NaCl with KCl.
AB  - Probiotic Iranian ultrafiltered Feta cheese was produced from ultrafiltration of  milk with a volumetric concentration factor of 4.5:1. The heat-treated retentates were inoculated with 10(7) cfu of Lactobacillus casei LAFTI L26/mL. A mesophilic-thermophilic mixed culture of Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris, and Streptococcus thermophilus was also used. Three percent (wt/wt) salt with different ratios of NaCl:KCl (100% NaCl, 50% NaCl:50% KCl, 75% NaCl:25% KCl, and 25% NaCl:75% KCl) were used in cheese formulation. The viability of L. casei was determined in treatments during the ripening period (90d at 5 degrees C) within 15-d intervals. The pH, titratable acidity, and redox potential changes were monitored throughout the mentioned period. The mean pH drop rate, mean acidity increase rate, and mean redox potential increase rate were calculated at the end of the storage period. Also, total nitrogen, water-soluble nitrogen, lactic acid, and acetic acid concentrations, and syneresis and sensory characteristics of the product were measured during the mentioned period every 30d. The maximum viability of L. casei was observed within d 15 to 30 of the ripening period in the treatment containing the lowest amount of sodium. Addition of KCl enhanced syneresis. Cheeses with NaCl alone and with only 25% replacement by KCl have the highest sensory acceptability.
TI  - The impact of NaCl substitution with KCl on proteinase activities cell-free extract and cell-free supernatant at different pH levels and salt concentrations: Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The effect of NaCl substitution with KCl at different pH levels (6.0, 5.5, and 5.0) and salt concentrations on proteinase activities of cell-free and supernatant of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 11824 (L. bulgaricus) and Streptococcus thermophilus MS (ST) was investigated. MRS broths were separately mixed with 4 salt treatments (NaCl only, 1NaCl:1KCl, 1NaCl:3KCl, and KCl only) at 2 different concentrations (5% and 10%) and incubated at 37 degrees C for 22 h. The cell pellets were used to prepare proteinase of cell-free extract and the cell-free supernatants were used as source of extracellular proteinases. The proteolytic activities and protein contents of both fractions were determined. The supernatants after incubation of both fractions with 3 milk caseins (alpha-, beta-, kappa-casein) were subjected to angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitory (ACE-inhibitory) activity and proteolytic activity by ortho-phthalaldehyde (OPA) method. Significant differences were observed in ACE-inhibitory activities and proteolytic (OPA) between salt treatments of cell-free extract and cell-free supernatant of L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus at same salt concentration and same pH level. There was a significant effect of pH level and salt treatments interaction on ACE-inhibitory activity, OPA activity and azocasein activity. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: To reduce sodium concentration in cheese by substituting of NaCl with KCl, it was important to study the effect on starter culture proteinases which play a vital role in ripening and texture profile of cheese.
TI  - Antioxidant properties of potentially probiotic bacteria: in vitro and in vivo activities.
AB  - Thirty-four strains of lactic acid bacteria (seven Bifidobacterium, 11 Lactobacillus, six Lactococcus, and 10 Streptococcus thermophilus) were assayed in vitro for antioxidant activity against ascorbic and linolenic acid oxidation (TAA(AA) and TAA(LA)), trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), intracellular glutathione (TGSH), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Wide dispersion of each of TAA(AA), TAA(LA), TEAC, TGSH, and SOD occurred within bacterial groups, indicating that antioxidative properties are strain specific. The strains Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis DSMZ 23032, Lactobacillus acidophilus DSMZ 23033, and Lactobacillus brevis DSMZ 23034 exhibited among the highest TAA(AA), TAA(LA), TEAC, and TGSH values within the lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. These strains were used to prepare a potentially antioxidative probiotic formulation, which was administered to rats at the dose of 10(7), 10(8), and 10(9) cfu/day for 18 days. The probiotic strains colonized the colon of the rats during the trial and promoted intestinal saccharolytic metabolism. The analysis of plasma antioxidant activity, reactive oxygen molecules level, and glutathione concentration, revealed that, when administered at doses of at least 10(8) cfu/day, the antioxidant mixture effectively reduced doxorubicin-induced oxidative stress. Probiotic strains which are capable to limit excessive amounts of reactive radicals in vivo may contribute to prevent and control several diseases associated with oxidative stress.
TI  - Identification, structural, and biochemical characterization of a group of large  Csn2 proteins involved in CRISPR-mediated bacterial immunity.
AB  - Many prokaryotic organisms acquire immunity against foreign genetic material by incorporating a short segment of foreign DNA called spacer into chromosomal loci, termed clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs). The encoded RNAs are processed into small fragments that guide the silencing of the invading genetic elements. The CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins are the main executioners of these processes. Herein, we report the crystal structure of Stu0660 of Streptococcus thermophilus, a Cas protein involved in the acquisition of new spacers. By homotetramerization, Stu0660 forms a central channel which is decorated with basic amino acids and binds linear double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), but not circular dsDNA. Despite undetectably low sequence similarity, two N-terminal domains of Stu0660 are similar to the entire structure of an Enterococcus faecalis Csn2 protein, which also forms a homotetramer and binds dsDNA. Thus, this work identifies a previously unknown group of Stu0660-like Csn2 proteins ( approximately 350 residues), which are larger than the known canonical Csn2 proteins ( approximately 220 residues) by containing an extra C-terminal domain. The commonly present central channel in the two subgroups appears as a design to selectively interact with linear dsDNA.
TI  - Increase of stress resistance in Lactococcus lactis via a novel food-grade vector expressing a shsp gene from Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The effects of the expression of a small heat shock protein (shsp) gene from Streptococcus thermophilus on stress resistance in Lactococcus lactis under different environmental stresses were investigated in this study. pMG36e-shsp, an expression vector, was first constructed by inserting a shsp open reading frame (ORF) cloned from S. thermophilus strain St-QC into pMG36e. Then, a food-grade expression vector, pMG-shsp, was generated by deleting the erythromycin resistance gene from pMG36e-shsp. The transformation rate of pMG-shsp was comparable to that of pMG36e-shsp when each of these two vectors was introduced into L. lactis. These results demonstrated that the shsp ORF could successfully used as a food-grade selection marker in both pMG-shsp and pMG36e-shsp. Furthermore, the growth characteristics were almost the same between L. lactis ML23 transformants harboring pMG36e or pMG-shsp. The survival rate of L. lactis ML23 expressing the shsp ORF were increased to 0.032%, 0.006%, 0.0027%, 0.03%, and 0.16% under the following environmental stresses: heat, acid, ethanol, bile salt and H2O2, respectively. These results indicated that the expression of the shsp gene in the food-grade vector pMG-shsp conferred resistance to environmental stresses without affecting the growth characteristics of L. lactis ML23.
TI  - Isolation and identification of cultivable lactic acid bacteria in traditional yak milk products of Gansu Province in China.
AB  - Various traditional fermented yak milk and raw milk foods could be considered as  an abundant resource for obtaining novel lactic acid bacteria (LAB) with unique properties. Eighty-eight samples of yak milk products were collected from Gansu Province in China. Three hundred and nineteen strains of LAB isolated from these samples were identified by phenotypic methods, 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and PCR-Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) technology. Among the isolates, one hundred and sixty-four isolates (51.41% of the total) were classified under Lactobacilli, and one hundred and fifty-five (48.59%) belonged to cocci. All the isolates were classified to six genera (Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, Streptococcus, Enterococcus and Weissella) and twenty-one species. Lactobacillus helveticus (87 strains), Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (49 strains), Streptococcus thermophilus (39 strains), Lactobacillus casei (31 strains) and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (19 strains) were considered as the predominant populations in the yak milk products. The results showed that there were abundant genus and species LAB existing in yak milk products in Gansu Province in China. The obtained LAB pure cultures may be a valuable source for further starter selection.
TI  - Phage-induced expression of CRISPR-associated proteins is revealed by shotgun proteomics in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The CRISPR/Cas system, comprised of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats along with their associated (Cas) proteins, protects bacteria and archaea from viral predation and invading nucleic acids. While the mechanism of action for this acquired immunity is currently under investigation, the response of Cas protein expression to phage infection has yet to be elucidated. In this study, we employed shotgun proteomics to measure the global proteome expression in a model system for studying the CRISPR/Cas response in S. thermophilus DGCC7710 infected with phage 2972. Host and viral proteins were simultaneously measured following inoculation at two different multiplicities of infection and across various time points using two-dimensional liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Thirty-seven out of forty predicted viral proteins were detected, including all proteins of the structural virome and viral effector proteins. In total, 1,013 of 2,079 predicted S. thermophilus proteins were detected, facilitating the monitoring of host protein synthesis changes in response to virus infection. Importantly, Cas proteins from all four CRISPR loci in the S. thermophilus DGCC7710 genome were detected, including loci previously thought to be inactive. Many Cas proteins were found to be constitutively expressed, but several demonstrated increased abundance following infection, including the signature Cas9 proteins from the CRISPR1 and CRISPR3 loci, which are key players in the interference phase of the CRISPR/Cas response. Altogether, these results provide novel insights into the proteomic response of S. thermophilus, specifically CRISPR-associated proteins, upon phage 2972 infection.
TI  - Alternating access mechanism in the POT family of oligopeptide transporters.
AB  - Short chain peptides are actively transported across membranes as an efficient route for dietary protein absorption and for maintaining cellular homeostasis. In mammals, peptide transport occurs via PepT1 and PepT2, which belong to the proton-dependent oligopeptide transporter, or POT family. The recent crystal structure of a bacterial POT transporter confirmed that they belong to the major facilitator superfamily of secondary active transporters. Despite the functional characterization of POT family members in bacteria, fungi and mammals, a detailed model for peptide recognition and transport remains unavailable. In this study, we report the 3.3-A resolution crystal structure and functional characterization of a POT family transporter from the bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus. Crystallized in an inward open conformation the structure identifies a hinge-like movement within the C-terminal half of the transporter that facilitates opening of an intracellular gate controlling access to a central peptide-binding site. Our associated functional data support a model for peptide transport that highlights the importance of salt bridge interactions in orchestrating alternating access within the POT family.
TI  - Short communication: effect of oxygen on symbiosis between Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (L. bulgaricus) and Streptococcus thermophilus are traditionally used for the manufacture of yogurt. It is said that a symbiotic relationship exists between Strep. thermophilus and L. bulgaricus and this decreases fermentation time. It is well known that L. bulgaricus is stimulated by the formate produced by Strep. thermophilus, and Strep. thermophilus is stimulated by free amino acids and peptides liberated from milk proteins by L. bulgaricus in symbiotic fermentation. We found that acid production by starter culture LB81 composed of L. bulgaricus 2038 and Strep. thermophilus 1131 was greatly accelerated by decreasing dissolved oxygen (DO) to almost 0 mg/kg in the yogurt mix (reduced dissolved oxygen fermentation) and that DO interferes with the symbiotic relationship between L. bulgaricus 2038 and Strep. thermophilus 1131. We attributed the acceleration of acid production of LB81 by reduced dissolved oxygen fermentation mainly to the acceleration of formate production and the suppression of acid production of LB81 by DO mainly to the suppression of formate production.
TI  - Proteolytic activation of proteose peptone component 3 by release of a C-terminal peptide with antibacterial properties.
AB  - The milk protein proteose peptone component 3 (PP3, also known as lactophorin) is a small phosphoglycoprotein, which is exclusively expressed in the lactating mammary gland. A 23-residue synthetic peptide (lactophoricin, Lpcin S), corresponding to the C-terminal amphipathic alpha-helix of PP3, has previously been shown to permeabilize membranes and display antibacterial activity. Lactophorin readily undergoes proteolytic cleavage in milk and during dairy processing, and it has been suggested that PP3-derived peptides are part of milk's endogenous defense system against bacteria. Here, we report that a 26-residue C-terminal peptide (Lpcin P) can be generated by trypsin proteolysis of PP3 and that structural and functional studies of Lpcin P indicate that the peptide has antibacterial properties. The Lpcin P showed alpha-helical structure in both anionic and organic solvents, and the amount of alpha-helical structure was increased in the presence of lipid vesicles. Oriented circular dichroism showed that Lpcin P oriented parallel to the membrane surface. However, the peptide permeabilized calcein-containing vesicles efficiently. Lpcin P displayed antibacterial activity against Streptococcus thermophilus, but not against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The PP3 full-length protein did not display the same properties, which could indicate that PP3 functions as a precursor protein that upon proteolysis, releases a bioactive antibacterial peptide.
TI  - Diversity in growth and protein degradation by dairy relevant lactic acid bacteria species in reconstituted whey.
AB  - The high nutritional value of whey makes it an interesting substrate for the development of fermented foods. The aim of this work was to evaluate the growth and proteolytic activity of sixty-four strains of lactic acid bacteria in whey to further formulate a starter culture for the development of fermented whey-based beverages. Fermentations were performed at 37 degrees C for 24 h in 10 and 16% (w/v) reconstituted whey powder. Cultivable populations, pH, and proteolytic activity (o-phthaldialdehyde test) were determined at 6 and 24 h incubation. Hydrolysis of whey proteins was analysed by Tricine SDS-PAGE. A principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to evaluate the behaviour of strains. Forty-six percent of the strains grew between 1 and 2 Deltalog CFU/ml while 19% grew less than 0.9 Deltalog CFU/ml in both reconstituted whey solutions. Regarding the proteolytic activity, most of the lactobacilli released amino acids and small peptides during the first 6 h incubation while streptococci consumed the amino acids initially present in whey to sustain growth. Whey proteins were degraded by the studied strains although to different extents. Special attention was paid to the main allergenic whey protein, beta-lactoglobulin, which was degraded the most by Lactobacillus acidophilus CRL 636 and Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CRL 656. The strain variability observed and the PCA applied in this study allowed selecting appropriate strains able to improve the nutritional characteristics (through amino group release and protein degradation) and storage (decrease in pH) of whey.
TI  - Production of natural folates by lactic acid bacteria starter cultures isolated from artisanal Argentinean yogurts.
AB  - Folate is a B-group vitamin that cannot be synthesized by humans and must be obtained exogenously. Although some species of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) can produce folates, little is known about the production of this vitamin by yogurt starter cultures. Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus strains were isolated from artisanal Argentinean yogurts and were grown in folate-free culture medium (FACM) and nonfat milk after which intracellular and extracellular folate production were evaluated. From the initial 92 isolated LAB strains, 4 L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and 32 S. thermophilus were able to grow in the absence of folate. Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CRL 863 and S. thermophilus CRL 415 and CRL 803 produced the highest extracellular folate levels (from 22.3 to 135 microg/L) in FACM. In nonfat milk, these strains were able to increase the initial folate concentrations by almost 190%. This is the first report where native strains of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus were shown to produce natural folate. The LAB strains identified in this study could be used in developing novel fermented products bio-enriched in natural folates that could in turn be used as an alternative to fortification with the controversial synthetic chemical folic acid.
TI  - Molecular analysis of the bacteriocin-encoding plasmid pDGL1 from Enterococcus durans and genetic characterization of the durancin GL locus.
AB  - Enterococci constitute a significant component of the lactic acid bacteria normally present in the intestinal microflora and include strains that produce bacteriocins. The genetic determinants for durancin GL in Enterococcus durans 41D were identified on the 8347 bp plasmid pDGL1 by plasmid curing experiments. pDGL1 contained nine putative ORFs, with ORF1 and ORF2 encoding plasmid replication proteins, and ORF3 and ORF6 showing high similarity to genes encoding mobilization proteins. The predicted protein encoded by ORF4 showed 74 % identity to BacA, a bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus faecalis. The deduced DurA protein contained the conserved motif YYGNG, suggesting that durancin GL is a typical subclass IIa bacteriocin. ORF5 was shown to share 85 % identity to the immunity protein BacB of Enterococcus faecalis. ORF9 displayed 87 % sequence identity to a conserved hypothetical protein of unknown function. To further clarify the minimum requirement for durancin GL production, a 547 bp fragment containing the durAB gene was fitted with the Streptococcus thermophilus P(2201) promoter and then subcloned and heterologously expressed in S. thermophilus ST128. The result demonstrated that the cloned fragment contained all the genetic components required for durancin GL production.
TI  - Effect of homogenization on the properties and microstructure of Mozzarella cheese from buffalo milk.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The name pasta filata refers to a unique plasticizing and texturing treatments of the fresh curd in hot water that imparts to the finished cheese its characteristic fibrous structure and melting properties. Mozzarella cheese made from standardized homogenized and non-homogenized buffalo milk with 3 and 1.5%fat. The effect of homogenization on rheological, microstructure and sensory evaluation was carried out. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fresh raw buffalo milk and starter cultures of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus were used. The coagulants were calf rennet powder (HA-LA). Standardized buffalo milk was homogenized at 25 kg/cm2 pressure after heating to 60 degrees C using homogenizer. Milk and cheese were analysed. Microstructure of the cheese samples was investigated either with an application of transmission or scanning electron microscope. Statistical analyses were applied on the obtained data. RESULTS: Soluble nitrogen total volatile free fatty acids, soluble tyrosine and tryptophan increased with using homogenized milk and also, increased with relatively decrease in case of homogenized Mozzarella cheese. Meltability of Mozzarella cheese increased with increasing the fat content and storage period and decrease with homogenization. Mozzarella cheese firmness increased with homogenization and also, increased with progressing of storage period. Flavour score, appearance and total score of Mozzarella cheese increased with homogenization and storage period progress, while body and texture score decreased with homogenization and increased with storage period progress. Microstructure of Mozzarella cheese showed the low fat cheese tends to be harder, more crumbly and less smooth than normal. Curd granule junctions were prominent in non-homogenized milk cheese. CONCLUSION: Homogenization of milk cheese caused changes in the microstructure of the Mozzarella cheese. Microstructure studies of cheese revealed that cheese made from homogenized milk is smoother and has a finer texture than non-homogenized but is also, firmer and more elastic.
TI  - Monitoring of the microbial communities involved in the soy sauce manufacturing process by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  - Soy sauce is a traditional seasoning produced through the fermentation of soybeans and wheat using microbes. In this study, the microbial communities involved in the soy sauce manufacturing process were analyzed by PCR-Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). The bacterial DGGE profile indicated that the bacterial microbes in the koji were Weissella cibaria (Weissella confusa, Weissella kimchii, Weissella salipiscis, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus iners, or Streptococcus thermophilus), Staphylococcus gallinarum (or Staphylococcus xylosus), and Staphylococcus kloosii. In addition to these bacteria, Tetragenococcus halophilus was also detected in the mash during lactic acid fermentation. The fungal DGGE profile indicated that the fungal microbes in the koji were not only Aspergillus oryzae but also several yeasts. In the mash, Zygosaccharomyces rouxii appeared in the early fermentation stage, Candida etchellsii (or Candida nodaensis) and Candida versatilis were detected at the middle fermentation stage, and Candida etchellsii was detected at the mature fermentation stage. These results suggest that the microbial communities present during the soy sauce manufacturing process change drastically throughout its production. This is the first report to reveal the microbial communities involved in the soy sauce manufacturing process using a culture-independent method.
TI  - Novel Streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius variants harboring lactose metabolism genes homologous to Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius belongs to the Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex (SBSEC) commonly associated with human and animal infections. We elucidated the lactose metabolism of S. infantarius subsp. infantarius predominant in African fermented milk products. S. infantarius subsp. infantarius isolates (n = 192) were identified in 88% of spontaneously fermented camel milk suusac samples (n = 24) from Kenya and Somalia at log(1)(0) 8.2-8.5 CFU mL(-)(1). African S. infantarius isolates excreted stoichiometric amounts of galactose when grown on lactose, exhibiting a metabolism similar to Streptococcus thermophilus and distinct from their type strain. African S. infantarius subsp. infantarius CJ18 harbors a regular gal operon with 99.7-100% sequence identity to S. infantarius subsp. infantarius ATCC BAA-102(T) and a gal-lac operon with 91.7-97.6% sequence identity to S. thermophilus, absent in all sequenced SBSEC strains analyzed. The expression and functionality of lacZ was demonstrated in a beta-galactosidase assay. The gal-lac operon was identified in 100% of investigated S. infantarius isolates (n = 46) from suusac samples and confirmed in Malian fermented cow milk isolates. The African S. infantarius variant potentially evolved through horizontal gene transfer of an S. thermophilus-homologous lactose pathway. Safety assessments are needed to identify any putative health risks of this novel S. infantarius variant.
TI  - The viability and intestinal epithelial cell adhesion of probiotic strain combination--in vitro study.
AB  - To be effective, probiotic bacteria must exhibit a number of functional characteristics, including the resistance to gastric acidity and the ability to adhere to the intestinal epithelium. In this study, we examined in vitro the viability of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) combination after exposure to low pH, and the adhesion of LAB to Caco-2 cells during coincubation of 9 bacterial strains. To test bacterial viability, 6 commercially available products were incubated in 0.1 N HCl at pH 1.2 for 60 min. The greatest growth inhibition was noted for the non-capsulated product containing the Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain (log reduction of CFU = 6.4), and the best survival observed for the product containing 9 bacterial strains, equipped with a modern capsule made according to the Multi-Resistant Encapsulation technology (log reduction of CFU = 0.1). In the adhesion experiment, the combination of 9 bacterial strains was added to 17-day-old Caco-2 cell culture for 90 min. The greatest efficiency of adhesion was observed for the inoculum containing 5.5x10(8) CFU/mL/9.6 cm(2) of Caco-2 and the dose of probiotic bacteria of 190 cells per one Caco-2 cell. As a result, approximately 157 bacterial cells adhered to one Caco-2 cell. The results indicate that the combination of 9 bacterial strains in the examined product is characterized as highly adhesive.
TI  - Effects of probiotics and antibiotics on the intestinal homeostasis in a computer controlled model of the large intestine.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotic associated diarrhea and Clostridium difficile infection are frequent complications of broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. Probiotic bacteria are used as therapeutic and preventive agents in these disorders, but the exact functional mechanisms and the mode of action are poorly understood. The effects of clindamycin and the probiotic mixture VSL#3 (containing the 8 bacterial strains Streptococcus thermophilus, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paracasei and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. Bulgaricus) consecutively or in combination were investigated and compared to controls without therapy using a standardized human fecal microbiota in a computer-controlled in vitro model of large intestine. Microbial metabolites (short chain fatty acids, lactate, branched chain fatty acids, and ammonia) and the intestinal microbiota were analyzed. RESULTS: Compared to controls and combination therapy, short chain fatty acids and lactate, but also ammonia and branched chain fatty acids, were increased under probiotic therapy. The metabolic pattern under combined therapy with antibiotics and probiotics had the most beneficial and consistent effect on intestinal metabolic profiles. The intestinal microbiota showed a decrease in several indigenous bacterial groups under antibiotic therapy, there was no significant recovery of these groups when the antibiotic therapy was followed by administration of probiotics. Simultaneous application of anti- and probiotics had a stabilizing effect on the intestinal microbiota with increased bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of VSL#3 parallel with the clindamycin therapy had a beneficial and stabilizing effect on the intestinal metabolic homeostasis by decreasing toxic metabolites and protecting the endogenic microbiota from destruction. Probiotics could be a reasonable strategy in prevention of antibiotic associated disturbances of the intestinal homeostasis and disorders.
TI  - Effect of chemico-physical parameters on the histidine decarboxylase (HdcA) enzymatic activity in Streptococcus thermophilus PRI60.
AB  - In this study the activity of the histidine decarboxylase (HdcA) of Streptococcus thermophilus PRI60 was determined during growth and in crude enzyme preparations to evaluate its hazardousness in dairy products. The effect of different pH values, lactose availability, NaCl concentration, and growth temperature on histamine production was evaluated in M17 medium during 168 h incubation. In each case, the production of histamine increased concomitantly with the cell number with a relatively small further rise during the stationary phase. In all cultures the maximum histamine levels were reached at the end of active growth. Histamine was detectable (10 to 55 mg/L) even when growth was strongly inhibited. The HdcA enzyme in crude cell-free extracts was mostly active at acidic pH values common in dairy products. NaCl concentrations lower than 5% did not affect its activity. The enzyme was quite resistant to heat treatments resembling low pasteurization, but was inactivated at 75 degrees C for 2 min. Given the features of the enzyme studied, efforts must be dedicated to a thorough risk analysis and development of strategies to contrast the presence of histaminogenic S. thermophilus strains in products from raw or mildly heat-treated milk. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: During its growth Streptococcus thermophilus can produce histamine over a wide range of conditions encountered in cheesemaking and cheese ripening. The histidine-decarboxylase is even more active in cell-free extract and histamine can be accumulated independently of cell viability.
TI  - Molecular analysis of the glutamate decarboxylase locus in Streptococcus thermophilus ST110.
AB  - gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is generated from glutamate by the action of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and characterized by hypotensive, diuretic, and tranquilizing effects in humans and animals. The production of GABA by lactic acid starter bacteria would enhance the functionality of fermented dairy foods including cheeses and yogurt. The survey of 42 strains of the yogurt starter culture Streptococcus thermophilus by PCR techniques indicated the presence of a glutamate decarboxylase gene (gadB) in 16 strains. DNA sequencing data indicated that the GAD/GABA antiporter locus (gadB/gadC) in GAD(+) S. thermophilus strains is flanked by transposase elements (5' and 3') and positioned between the luxS (5') and the HD-superfamily hydrolase genes (3'). The PCR amplification product of a ca. 2-kb genomic fragment that included the gadB and its putative promoter region was inserted into a shuttle vector, which was used to transform Escherichia coli DH5alpha. Subsequently, the recombinant plasmid pMEU5a-1/gadB (7.24 kb) was electrotransformed into the GAD-negative strain S. thermophilus ST128. The ST128 transformants carrying the plasmid-encoded gadB produced functional GAD enzyme as evidenced by the conversion of glutamate to GABA at a rate similar to strains with the gadB/gadC operon located on the chromosome. The results demonstrated the potential to impart to non-GABA-producing strains of S. thermophilus and other lactic acid bacteria the GAD(+) phenotype that improves their appeal in possible applications in the development of health-promoting functional foods.
TI  - Rapid and accurate bacterial identification in probiotics and yoghurts by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.
AB  - Probiotic food is manufactured by adding probiotic strains simultaneously with starter cultures in fermentation tanks. Here, we investigate the accuracy and feasibility of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) for bacterial identification at the species level in probiotic food and yoghurts. Probiotic food and yoghurts were cultured in Columbia and Lactobacillus specific agar and tested by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) for the detection and quantification of Lactobacillus sp. Bacterial identification was performed by MALDI-TOF analysis and by amplification and sequencing of tuf and 16S rDNA genes. We tested 13 probiotic food and yoghurts and we identified by qPCR that they presented 10(6) to 10(7) copies of Lactobacillus spp. DNA/g. All products contained very large numbers of living bacteria varying from 10(6) to 10(9) colony forming units/g. These bacteria were identified as Lactobacillus casei, Lactococcus lactis, Bifidobacterium animalis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, and Streptococcus thermophilus. MALDI-TOF MS presented 92% specificity compared to the molecular assays. In one product we found L. lactis, instead of Bifidus spp. which was mentioned on the label and for another L. delbrueckii and S. thermophilus instead of Bifidus spp. MALDI-TOF MS allows a rapid and accurate bacterial identification at the species level in probiotic food and yoghurts. Although the safety and functionality of probiotics are species and strain dependent, we found a discrepancy between the bacterial strain announced on the label and the strain identified. Practical Application: MALDI-TOF MS is rapid and specific for the identification of bacteria in probiotic food and yoghurts. Although the safety and functionality of probiotics are species and strain dependent, we found a discrepancy between the bacterial strain announced on the label and the strain identified.
TI  - Determination of lactic microflora of kefir grains and kefir beverage by using culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  - In this study, we investigated the bacterial compositions of kefir grains and kefir beverages collected from different regions of Turkey by using culture-independent and culture-dependent methods. In the culture-independent detection, 10 different species of bacteria were detected in total by using the polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) analysis of the 16S rRNA gene V3 region. Among these species, Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens was the most dominant one in the kefir grains, while Lactococcus lactis was found to be significantly prevalent in the kefir beverages. In the culture-dependent detection, the primary differentiation and grouping of the isolates from kefir beverages and kefir grains were performed using repetitive sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) fingerprinting, and the results were validated by 16S rDNA full-length sequencing. According to the results of culture-dependent methods, the most frequently isolated species were L. lactis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Lactobacillus kefiri, respectively. Only 3 species, which are L. lactis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Streptococcus thermophilus, were detected with both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. This study showed that the combination of both methods is necessary for a detailed and reliable investigation of microbial communities in kefir grains and kefir beverages. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Due to their artisan- and region-dependent microflora, kefir products can be a source of interesting lactic acid bacteria, either new taxa or strains with specific functional properties, which might be used for the development of new starter cultures and innovative food products. Therefore, an increasing demand exists for new strains that show desirable effects on the product characteristics Artisan dairy products are a candidate source of such microorganisms. For this reason, in this study, the bacterial compositions of kefir grains and kefir beverages obtained from different regions of Turkey were studied using culture-dependent and culture-independent molecular methods.
TI  - Structural characterization of the exopolysaccharide produced by Streptococcus thermophilus 05-34 and its in situ application in yogurt.
AB  - An exopolysaccharide (EPS) producing strain was isolated from Tibetan kefir grains in China, which was identified by 16S rDNA tests and designated as Streptococcus thermophilus 05-34. The high-performance liquid chromatography analysis showed that it was composed of galactose and glucose in a molar ratio of 1.0:0.8 with a molecular mass of 2.5 x 10(4) Da. EPS was further revealed to have alpha-d-glucose, alpha-d-galactose, beta-d-glucose, and beta-d-galactose by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy combined with 1D (1) H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The length of EPS ranged from 10 to 100 nm and the maximal height of lumps was 2.5 nm through atomic force micrograph analysis. Furthermore, yogurt fermented with EPS-producing S. thermophilus 05-34 exhibited lower susceptibility to whey separation, higher viscosity, and sensory scores than those made with non-EPS-producing strain in yogurt production. These results suggested that EPS-producing Streptococcus thermophilus 05-34 provided a potential application in the fermented dairy industry.
TI  - Properties of a putative cambialistic superoxide dismutase from the aerotolerant  bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus strain LMG 18311.
AB  - The aerotolerance of the lactic - fermentative bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus is mainly based on the key antioxidant function of superoxide dismutase (StSOD). In this work, the comparison of recombinant StSOD (rStSOD) forms obtained from two different initiation triplets indicated that the enzyme from S. thermophilus strain LMG 18311 spans 201 residues. rStSOD is organised as a homodimer, even though protein aggregates are formed in concentrated solutions. The capability of binding and exchanging Fe or Mn in the active site classifies rStSOD as a putative cambialistic enzyme; the moderate preference for iron is counteracted by a 1.5-fold higher activity measured for the Mn-containing form. The enzyme is thermostable, being its half-inactivation time 10 min at 73.5 degrees C; the energetic parameters of the heat inactivation process are regulated by the level of Mn cofactor. The effect of Mn content on the rStSOD sensitivity towards inhibitors and inactivators was also evaluated. Sodium azide acts as a weak inhibitor of rStSOD and its Mn content does not greatly affect this sensitivity. Concerning the physiological inactivator hydrogen peroxide, the Mn-enriched rStSOD displays a great resistance; a moderate sensitivity is instead observed in the presence of a low Mn content. Contrary to hydrogen peroxide, sodium peroxynitrite is a powerful inactivator, a behaviour enhanced in the Mn-enriched enzyme. All these results were compared with the corresponding data previously reported for the cambialistic SOD from the taxonomically related S. mutans. In S. thermophilus the regulation of the enzyme functions by the Mn content appears less relevant with respect to S. mutans.
TI  - A survey of the bacterial composition of kurut from Tibet using a culture-independent approach.
AB  - Kurut (fermented yak milk) made by natural fermentation is a very important dairy food for the local people in Tibet (China). It is important to fully understand the bacterial composition of kurut for quality improvement and industrial production. Because more than 99% of prokaryotes cannot be cultured and identified by methods currently used in taxonomy, we applied a culture-independent approach to explore the microbial biodiversity of this traditional food. In this study, a bacterial 16S rRNA gene clone library, including 460 clones, was constructed using total DNA extracted from 30 samples of kurut. After screening by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, 56 operational taxonomic units (OTU) with unique RFLP patterns were obtained. Then, 1 representative sequence of every OTU was sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed. The representative phylotypes were affiliated with 5 groups, including Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactobacillus helveticus, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and Acetobacter. In addition, nearly one-third of the representative clones (132 clones) had low similarity to species in GenBank (<97%), and these phylotypes were regarded as unknown bacteria. The characteristics of kurut are determined not only by lactic acid bacteria well known by the culture-dependent approach but also by bacteria that have not yet been identified.
TI  - Development of marine probiotics: prospects and approach.
AB  - The term probiotics stands for bacterial strain acting for the upliftment of beneficial gut microflora as well as restricting the growth of decay or disease causing bacteria and other agents. They protect us from disease causing microorganisms and are vital for the digestion of nutrients and food. Researchers are now trying to explore the possibilities of therapeutic applications of probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease, treating diarrhea, eczema prevention in children, and reducing bladder cancer recurrence and urinary tract infections. The best known probiotic strains are Bifidobacteria, Lactobacilli, and Streptococcus thermophilus and can be found in food products such as yoghurts, fermented and unfermented milk, miso, tempeh, and some juices and soy beverages. Thus, as a substitute to the use of antibiotics, the dietary supplementation with probiotic bacteria is being widely employed in the aquaculture industry. This chapter is an attempt to shift the paradigm of research in probiotic area to the marine environment and to find ways of expanding the research in marine probiotics development.
TI  - Improved acid stress survival of Lactococcus lactis expressing the histidine decarboxylation pathway of Streptococcus thermophilus CHCC1524.
AB  - Degradative amino acid decarboxylation pathways in bacteria generate secondary metabolic energy and provide resistance against acid stress. The histidine decarboxylation pathway of Streptococcus thermophilus CHCC1524 was functionally expressed in the heterologous host Lactococcus lactis NZ9000, and the benefits of the newly acquired pathway for the host were analyzed. During growth in M17 medium in the pH range of 5-6.5, a small positive effect was observed on the biomass yield in batch culture, whereas no growth rate enhancement was evident. In contrast, a strong benefit for the engineered L. lactis strain was observed in acid stress survival. In the presence of histidine, the pathway enabled cells to survive at pH values as low as 3 for at least 2 h, conditions under which the host cells were rapidly dying. The flux through the histidine decarboxylation pathway in cells grown at physiological pH was under strict control of the electrochemical proton gradient (pmf) across the membrane. Ionophores that dissipated the membrane potential (DeltaPsi) and/or the pH gradient (DeltapH) strongly increased the flux, whereas the presence of glucose almost completely inhibited the flux. Control of the pmf over the flux was exerted by both DeltaPsi and DeltapH and was distributed over the transporter HdcP and the decarboxylase HdcA. The control allowed for a synergistic effect between the histidine decarboxylation and glycolytic pathways in acid stress survival. In a narrow pH range around 2.5 the synergism resulted in a 10-fold higher survival rate.
TI  - Dual functionality of triticale as a novel dietary source of prebiotics with antioxidant activity in fermented dairy products.
AB  - The objectives of this study were to: (i) define the optimum concentration of triticale bran (TB) that can be incorporated in yogurt, (ii) evaluate the prebiotic effects of TB on microbial viability, pH and total titratable acidity (TTA) in yogurt across 28 days of cold storage, and (iii) measure the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) of water-extractable polysaccharides (WEP) in TB. Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus were used as starter cultures. Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium lactis were used as probiotics. A concentration of 4% TB in yogurt was determined to be the maximum amount that could be added without causing synersis. By day 7, the number of bacteria greatly increased in yogurt samples containing TB and maintained higher viable bacteria counts at the end of the cold storage period, in comparison to controls (P </= 0.05). Confirming this data was the lower pH levels and higher TTA values of TB yogurt samples exhibited throughout 28 days (P </= 0.05). Polysaccharide extracts of TB exhibited strong antioxidant activity with an ORAC value of 33.86 +/- 2.30 mumol trolox equivalents (TE)/g of bran. Results of this study suggest that TB may serve as a new prebiotic and antioxidant source for functional foods and nutraceutical applications.
TI  - Effect of daily consumption of probiotic yogurt on oxidative stress in pregnant women: a randomized controlled clinical trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to the enhanced oxygen requirement of the mitochondria-rich placenta primarily during the third trimester, pregnancy is associated with elevated levels of oxidative stress. This study was designed to determine the effects of daily consumption of probiotic yogurt on oxidative stress among Iranian pregnant women. METHODS: This randomized single-blind controlled clinical trial was performed among 70 pregnant women, singleton primigravida, aged 18-30 in their third trimester. Subjects were randomly assigned to two groups to consume 200 g/day of either conventional yogurt (n = 33) or probiotic yogurt (n = 37) for 9 weeks. Fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and after a 9-week intervention to measure oxidative stress parameters. RESULTS: Consumption of probiotic yogurt resulted in increased erythrocyte glutathione reductase (GR) levels as compared to the conventional yogurt (p = 0.01). Despite the significant effect of probiotic yogurt consumption on plasma glutathione (67.9 mumol/l, p = 0.01), erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase (163 mmol/min/ml, p = 0.04) and serum 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine levels (-74.3 ng/ml, p = 0.04), no significant differences were found between the two yogurts in terms of their effects on the mentioned parameters. CONCLUSION: Consumption of probiotic yogurt among pregnant women resulted in increased levels of erythrocyte GR as compared to the conventional yogurt, but could not affect other indices of oxidative stress.
TI  - Persistence of wild Streptococcus thermophilus strains on wooden vat and during the manufacture of a traditional Caciocavallo type cheese.
AB  - The present work was undertaken to evaluate the influence of the wooden dairy plant equipment on the microbiological characteristics of curd to be transformed into Caciocavallo Palermitano cheese. Traditional raw milk productions were performed concomitantly with standard cheese making trials carried out in stainless steel vat inoculated with a commercial starter. Milk from two different farms (A and B) was separately processed. The wooden vat was found to be a reservoir of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), while unwanted (spoilage and/or pathogenic) microorganisms were not hosted or were present at very low levels. All microbial groups were numerically different in bulk milks, showing higher levels for the farm B. LAB, especially thermophilic cocci, dominated the whole cheese making process of all productions. Undesired microorganisms decreased in number or disappeared during transformation, particularly after curd stretching. LAB were isolated from the wooden vat surface and from all dairy samples, subjected to phenotypic and genetic characterization and identification. Streptococcus thermophilus was the species found at the highest concentration in all samples analyzed and it also dominated the microbial community of the wooden vat. Fourteen other LAB species belonging to six genera (Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, Streptococcus and Weissella) were also detected. All S. thermophilus isolates were genetically differentiated and a consortium of four strains persisted during the whole traditional production process. As confirmed by pH and the total acidity after the acidification step, indigenous S. thermophilus strains acted as a mixed starter culture.
TI  - [Development of pulsed field gel electrophoresis and application for characterization and identification of Lactobacillus and Streptococcus thermophilus].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) method for molecular typing of Lactobacillus and Streptococcus thermophilus (S. thermophilus) and to apply it in identification and characterization of both bacteria isolated from yoghurt collected from Beijing supermarket. METHODS: The five most useful restriction enzymes including Apa I, Not I, Sfi I, Xba I and Sma I were chosen to cut DNA of 52 strains of Lactobacillus, S. thermophilus as well as associated standard bacteria strains. The endonucleases and electrophoresis conditions for PFGE analysis were optimized and applied in molecular typing of Lactobacillus and S.thermophilus isolates. Cluster analysis based on the PFGE data was conducted. The identification results of PFGE were compared with those obtained in biochemical and 16s ribosomal RNA PCR identification tests. RESULTS: Not I was suitable for L. bulgaricus, L. fermentum and L. delbrueckii digestion. While Apa I was an appropriate endonuclease for S. thermophilus, L. acidophilus and L. casei digestion. The results of molecular typing indicated that 24 strains of L.bulgaricus and 15 strains of S. thermophilus were grouped into 8 types by PFGE method, respectively. While 7 strains of L.acidophilus were grouped into 3 types and 2 strains of L. delbrueckii were grouped into 2 different PFGE types. CONCLUSION: The results of PFGE analysis are in compliance with those of 16s rRNA PCR and biochemical identification. The PFGE method developed in this study is suitable for molecular characterization of both Lactobacillus and S. thermophilus.
TI  - Effect of D-alanine in teichoic acid from the Streptococcus thermophilus cell wall on the barrier-protection of intestinal epithelial cells.
AB  - D-Alanylation of teichoic acid (TA) affects various functions of Gram-positive bacteria, including immunomodulatory effects. We investigated in this study the impact of D-alanine (D-Ala) in TA from Streptococcus thermophilus ATCC 19258(T) on the barrier-protecting effect in human intestinal Caco-2 cells. ATCC 19258(T) suppressed the tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance (TER), an indicator of the barrier function. The D-alanylation of TA in ATCC 19258(T) was growth phase- and culture temperature-dependent. Treatment of ATCC 19258(T) with Mg(2+) decreased the dlt mRNA expression and D-Ala content in TA and also abolished the suppressive effect on the TER decrease. Supplementation with L-alanine (L-Ala) to the broth led to an increase of D-Ala in ATCC 19258(T) and of the intestinal barrier-protecting effect. Taken together, D-Ala in TA played an important role in the barrier-protecting effect of S. thermophilus in the intestinal epithelium, and these beneficial effects could be enhanced by exogenous L-Ala.
TI  - Quantitative proteomic analysis of bacterial enzymes released in cheese during ripening.
AB  - Due to increasingly available bacterial genomes in databases, proteomic tools have recently been used to screen proteins expressed by micro-organisms in food in order to better understand their metabolism in situ. While the main objective is the systematic identification of proteins, the next step will be to bridge the gap between identification and quantification of these proteins. For that purpose, a new mass spectrometry-based approach was applied, using isobaric tagging reagent for quantitative proteomic analysis (iTRAQ), which are amine specific and yield labelled peptides identical in mass. Experimental Swiss-type cheeses were manufactured from microfiltered milk using Streptococcus thermophilus ITG ST20 and Lactobacillus helveticus ITG LH1 as lactic acid starters. At three ripening times (7, 20 and 69 days), cheese aqueous phases were extracted and enriched in bacterial proteins by fractionation. Each sample, standardised in protein amount prior to proteomic analyses, was: i) analysed by 2D-electrophoresis for qualitative analysis and ii) submitted to trypsinolysis, and labelled with specific iTRAQ tag, one per ripening time. The three labelled samples were mixed together and analysed by nano-LC coupled on-line with ESI-QTOF mass spectrometer. Thirty proteins, both from bacterial or bovine origin, were identified and efficiently quantified. The free bacterial proteins detected were enzymes from the central carbon metabolism as well as stress proteins. Depending on the protein considered, the quantity of these proteins in the cheese aqueous extract increased from 2.5 to 20 fold in concentration from day 7 to day 69 of ripening.
TI  - Adaptor protein MecA is a negative regulator of the expression of late competence genes in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - In Streptococcus thermophilus, the ComRS regulatory system governs the transcriptional level of comX expression and, hence, controls the early stage of competence development. The present work focuses on the posttranslational control of the activity of the sigma factor ComX and, therefore, on the late stage of competence regulation. In silico analysis performed on the S. thermophilus genome revealed the presence of a homolog of mecA (mecA(St)), which codes for the adaptor protein that is involved in ComK degradation by ClpCP in Bacillus subtilis. Using reporter strains and microarray experiments, we showed that MecA(St) represses late competence genes without affecting the early competence stage under conditions that are not permissive for competence development. In addition, this repression mechanism was found not only to act downstream of comX expression but also to be fully dependent on the presence of a functional comX gene. This negative control was similarly released in strains deleted for clpC, mecA, and clpC-mecA. Under artificial conditions of comX expression, we next showed that the abundance of ComX is higher in the absence of MecA or ClpC. Finally, results of bacterial two-hybrid assays strongly suggested that MecA interacts with both ComX and ClpC. Based on these results, we proposed that ClpC and MecA act together in the same regulatory circuit to control the abundance of ComX in S. thermophilus.
TI  - Biology and genome sequence of Streptococcus mutans phage M102AD.
AB  - M102AD is the new designation for a Streptococcus mutans phage described in 1993  as phage M102. This change was necessitated by the genome analysis of another S. mutans phage named M102, which revealed differences from the genome sequence reported here. Additional host range analyses confirmed that S. mutans phage M102AD infects only a few serotype c strains. Phage M102AD adsorbed very slowly to its host, and it cannot adsorb to serotype e and f strains of S. mutans. M102AD adsorption was blocked by c-specific antiserum. Phage M102AD also adsorbed equally well to heat-treated and trypsin-treated cells, suggesting carbohydrate receptors. Saliva and polysaccharide production did not inhibit plaque formation. The genome of this siphophage consisted of a linear, double-stranded, 30,664-bp DNA molecule, with a GC content of 39.6%. Analysis of the genome extremities indicated the presence of a 3'-overhang cos site that was 11 nucleotides long. Bioinformatic analyses identified 40 open reading frames, all in the same orientation. No lysogeny-related genes were found, indicating that phage M102AD is strictly virulent. No obvious virulence factor gene candidates were found. Twelve proteins were identified in the virion structure by mass spectrometry. Comparative genomic analysis revealed a close relationship between S. mutans phages M102AD and M102 as well as with Streptococcus thermophilus phages. This study also highlights the importance of conducting research with biological materials obtained from recognized microbial collections.
TI  - Manufacture of Fior di Latte cheese by incorporation of probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  - This work aimed to select heat-resistant probiotic lactobacilli to be added to Fior di Latte (high-moisture cow milk Mozzarella) cheese. First, 18 probiotic strains belonging to Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Lactobacillus reuteri were screened. Resistance to heating (65 or 55 degrees C for 10 min) varied markedly between strains. Adaptation at 42 degrees C for 10 min increased the heat resistance at 55 degrees C for 10 min of all probiotic lactobacilli. Heat-adapted L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus SP5 (decimal reduction time at 55 degrees C of 227.4 min) and L. paracasei BGP1 (decimal reduction time at 55 degrees C of 40.8 min) showed the highest survival under heat conditions that mimicked the stretching of the curd and were used for the manufacture of Fior di Latte cheese. Two technology options were chosen: chemical (addition of lactic acid to milk) or biological (Streptococcus thermophilus as starter culture) acidification with or without addition of probiotics. As determined by random amplified polymorphic DNA-PCR and 16S rRNA gene analyses, the cell density of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus SP5 and L. paracasei BGP1 in chemically or biologically acidified Fior di Latte cheese was approximately 8.0 log(10)cfu/g. Microbiological, compositional, biochemical, and sensory analyses (panel test by 30 untrained judges) showed that the use of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus SP5 and L. paracasei BGP1 enhanced flavor formation and shelf-life of Fior di Latte cheeses.
TI  - Deletion of the murein hydrolase CbpD reduces transformation efficiency in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Recently it has been shown that Streptococcus thermophilus is competent for natural genetic transformation. This property is widespread among streptococci and may include all members of the genus. Upon entering the competent state, streptococci start transcribing a number of competence-specific genes whose products are required for binding, uptake and processing of transforming DNA. In addition to the core competence genes, competent streptococci express a number of accessory genes that are dispensable for transformation in the laboratory, but presumably play an important role under natural conditions. In Streptococcus pneumoniae, one of these accessory genes encodes a competence-specific murein hydrolase termed CbpD. Experimental evidence indicates that pneumococcal CbpD is part of a predatory mechanism that lyses noncompetent sister cells or members of closely related species in order to release homologous DNA that can be taken up by the competent attacker cells. Competent S. thermophilus LMG18311 cells produce a CbpD-like protein, Stu0039, which might have the same or a similar function. In the present study we have characterized this protein and shown that it is a murein hydrolase with a novel type of cell surface-binding domain. Furthermore, we show that Stu0039 is rapidly inactivated by H(2)O(2) produced during aerobic growth of S. thermophilus. We propose that this inactivation mechanism has evolved for self-protection purposes to prevent extensive autolysis in a competent population. Interestingly, in contrast to pneumococcal CbpD, which does not affect the transformation properties of the producer strain, deletion of Stu0039 reduces the transformability of S. thermophilus.
TI  - Cytokine profile and induction of T helper type 17 and regulatory T cells by human peripheral mononuclear cells after microbial exposure.
AB  - The immunomodulatory effects of probiotics were assessed following exposure of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), cord blood cells and the spleen-derived monocyte/macrophage cell line CRL-9850 to Lactobacillus acidophilus LAVRI-A1, Lb. rhamnosus GG, exopolysaccharides (EPS)-producing Streptococcus thermophilus St1275, Bifidobacteriun longum BL536, B. lactis B94 and Escherichia coli TG1 strains. The production of a panel of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines by PBMC following bacterial stimulation was measured, using live, heat-killed or mock gastrointestinal tract (GIT)-exposed bacteria, and results show that (i) all bacterial strains investigated induced significant secretion of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines from PBMC-derived monocytes/macrophages; and (ii) cytokine levels increased relative to the expansion of bacterial cell numbers over time for cells exposed to live cultures. Bifidobacteria and S. thermophilus stimulated significant concentrations of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, an interleukin necessary for the differentiation of regulatory T cells (T(reg) )/T helper type 17 (Th17) cells and, as such, the study further examined the induction of Th17 and T(reg) cells after PBMC exposure to selected bacteria for 96 h. Data show a significant increase in the numbers of both cell types in the exposed populations, measured by cell surface marker expression and by cytokine production. Probiotics have been shown to induce cytokines from a range of immune cells following ingestion of these organisms. These studies suggest that probiotics' interaction with immune-competent cells produces a cytokine milieu, exerting immunomodulatory effects on local effector cells, as well as potently inducing differentiation of Th17 and T(reg) cells.
TI  - The influence of selected prebiotics on the growth of lactic acid bacteria for bio-yoghurt production.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prebiotics are a category of nutritional com-pounds grouped together, not necessarily by structural similarities, but by ability to promote the growth of spe-cific beneficial (probiotic) gut bacteria. Fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and inulin are among the most famous prebiotic compounds. In order to improve viability of probiotic bacteria during storage, fermented food should be supplemented with prebiotics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Yoghurts were produced from skimmed milk powder and prebiotics (FOS, inulin or resistant starch), which were added at concentrations of 1%, 2% and 3%. Yoghurts were stored in +4 degrees C for three weeks. Every week each kind of fermented drink was examined in order to check the growth of lactic acid bacteria. Apparent viscosity and texture of bio-yoghurt were determinated during refrigerated storage. RESULTS: The FOS and inulin addition to yoghurt caused an increase in the numbers of all bacteria in comparison to control yoghurt obtained without addition of prebiotics. The viable counts of Str. thermophilus, Lb. acidophilus and Bifidobacterium sp. when 1% of FOS was added to yoghurt were about 9 log cfu/g, 7.8 log cfu/g and 7.7 log cfu/g, respectively. In the presence of 1% of inulin, streptococci and bifidobacteria reached the growth at the level 8.8 log cfu/g and 7.5 respectively. Hardness and adhesiveness of yoghurt obtained with addition resistant starch increased systematically during 21 days of refrigerated storage. CONCLUSIONS: The numbers of lactic acid bacteria in obtained bio-yoghurts were sufficient in 97% of samples (10(6)-10(9) cfu/g) according to FAO/WHO protocols. Generally, viability of bacteria was sufficient for 14 days and then their numbers decreased but usually not below 10(6) cfu/g. Prebiotics as FOS and inulin added to bio-yoghurt exhibited stimulatory effect on growth Lb. acidophilus and Bifidobacterium sp. Addition of prebiotics caused an increase in apparent viscosity and hardness (in case of FOS) and decrease in syneresis of obtained bio-yoghurts.
TI  - Carbohydrate metabolism is essential for the colonization of Streptococcus thermophilus in the digestive tract of gnotobiotic rats.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus is the archetype of lactose-adapted bacterium and so far, its sugar metabolism has been mainly investigated in vitro. The objective of this work was to study the impact of lactose and lactose permease on S. thermophilus physiology in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of gnotobiotic rats. We used rats mono-associated with LMD-9 strain and receiving 4.5% lactose. This model allowed the analysis of colonization curves of LMD-9, its metabolic profile, its production of lactate and its interaction with the colon epithelium. Lactose induced a rapid and high level of S. thermophilus in the GIT, where its activity led to 49 mM of intra-luminal L-lactate that was related to the induction of mono-carboxylic transporter mRNAs (SLC16A1 and SLC5A8) and p27(Kip1) cell cycle arrest protein in epithelial cells. In the presence of a continuous lactose supply, S. thermophilus recruited proteins involved in glycolysis and induced the metabolism of alternative sugars as sucrose, galactose, and glycogen. Moreover, inactivation of the lactose transporter, LacS, delayed S. thermophilus colonization. Our results show i/that lactose constitutes a limiting factor for colonization of S. thermophilus, ii/that activation of enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism constitutes the metabolic signature of S. thermophilus in the GIT, iii/that the production of lactate settles the dialogue with colon epithelium. We propose a metabolic model of management of carbohydrate resources by S. thermophilus in the GIT. Our results are in accord with the rationale that nutritional allegation via consumption of yogurt alleviates the symptoms of lactose intolerance.
TI  - Production of volatile compounds in reconstituted milk reduced-fat cheese and the physicochemical properties as affected by exopolysaccharide-producing strain.
AB  - The application of the exopolysaccharide-producing strains for improving the texture and technical properties of reduced-fat cheese looks very promising. Streptococcus thermophilus TM11 was evaluated for production of reduced-fat cheese using reconstituted milk powder (CRMP). The physicochemical analysis of fresh and stored cheeses showed that this strain slightly increased moisture content resulting in cheese with higher yield and lower protein content compared to the direct acidified cheese. The volatiles of cheese were determined by SPME and GC equipped with a mass spectrometer. The results indicated that the major compounds included aldehydes, ketones and acids, whereas, alcohols and branched-chain aldehydes that contribute to exciting and harsh flavors were not found in CRMP. By the textural profile analysis, we found the cheese made with S. thermophilus TM11 had lower cohesiveness, resilience and higher adhesiveness than the direct acidified cheese, and had similar hardness. Further, S. thermophilus TM11 greatly changed the protein matrix with more opened cavities according to observation by scanning electron microscopy. Consequently, use of S. thermophilus TM11 could endow CRMP with the novel and suitable flavor properties and improved texture quality.
TI  - Selenium-enriched probiotics improves murine male fertility compromised by high fat diet.
AB  - A total of 75 male mice were allotted to five groups of 15 each in a completely randomized experimental design to study the effects of probiotics, inorganic selenium, and selenium-enriched probiotics on male fertility in hyperlipidemic status. The mice in group 1 were fed a normal basal diet and served as negative control. The mice in group 2 were fed a high fat diet and served as positive control. The mice in groups 3, 4, and 5 were fed the high fat diet supplemented with probiotics, inorganic selenium, and selenium-enriched probiotics, respectively. The high fat diet was composed of 15% lard, 1% cholesterol, 0.3% cholic acid, and 83.7% basal diet. Over 90% of the selenium in the selenium-enriched probiotics was present in forms of organic selenium. After the mice were fed these diets for 75 days, serumal total cholesterol, triglycerides, low density lipoprotein, high density lipoprotein, and testosterone levels, plus sperm index (count, motility and abnormalities), penis length, and weight and histopathology of testes were measured. The results showed that in the mice fed the high fat diet were significant (P < 0.01) elevations of serumal total cholesterol, triglycerides and low density lipoprotein, and decreases of high density lipoprotein. The high fat diet caused a decline in serumal testosterone level, reduced semen quality, and atrophy and degeneration of seminiferous tubules. No effects on penis length or relative weight of testis were observed. Supplementation of probiotics, inorganic selenium, or selenium-enriched probiotics to the high fat diet significantly alleviated (P < 0.05) the adverse effects of hyperlipidemia by reducing testicular tissue injury, increasing serumal testosterone level, and improving sperm indexes. It was concluded that hyperlipidemia had significant adverse effects on male fertility, which could be ameliorated at various degrees by feeding the diets supplemented with probiotics, inorganic selenium, or selenium-enriched probiotics. Selenium-enriched probiotics or inorganic selenium supplementation gave better results than probiotics supplementation and may be used to improve animal and human male fertility compromised by hyperlipidemia or obesity.
TI  - A combination of direct viable count and fluorescence in situ hybridization for specific enumeration of viable Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp.bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - AIMS: We have developed a direct viable count (DVC)-FISH procedure for quickly and easily discriminating between viable and nonviable cells of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus strains, the traditional yogurt bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: direct viable count method has been modified and adapted for Lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Strep. thermophilus analysis by testing different times of incubation and concentrations of DNA-gyrase inhibitors. DVC procedure has been combined with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for the specific detection of viable cells of both bacteria with specific rRNA oligonucleotide probes (DVC-FISH). Of the four antibiotics tested (novobiocin, nalidixic acid, pipemidic acid and ciprofloxacin), novobiocin was the most effective for DVC method and the optimum incubation time was 7 h for both bacteria. The number of viable cells was obtained by the enumeration of specific hybridized cells that were elongated at least twice their original length for Lactobacillus and twice their original size for Streptococcus. CONCLUSIONS: This technique was successfully applied to detect viable cells in inoculated faeces. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Results showed that this DVC-FISH procedure is a quick and culture-independent useful method to specifically detect viable Lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Strep. thermophilus in different samples, being applied for the first time to lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - The effect of a multispecies probiotic mixture on the symptoms and fecal microbiota in diarrhea-dominant irritable bowel syndrome: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical effect of probiotics on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is still controversial. AIMS: We aimed to evaluate the effects of a probiotic mixture on IBS symptoms and the composition of fecal microbiota in patients with diarrhea-dominant IBS (D-IBS). METHODS: Fifty patients with D-IBS were randomized into placebo or probiotic mixture (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium lactis, Bifidobacterium longum, and Streptococcus thermophilus 1.0x10 CFU) groups. Treatment was taken daily for 8 weeks. The primary outcome was adequate relief (AR) of overall IBS symptoms, which was assessed weekly for 10 weeks. A responder was defined as a patient who experienced AR for at least half of the 10-week study period. Secondary outcomes included the effects on individual symptoms, stool parameters, and IBS quality of life. The fecal flora compositions were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). RESULTS: The proportion of AR was consistently higher in the probiotics group than in the placebo group throughout the 10-week period (P<0.05). The proportion of responders was significantly higher in the probiotics group than in the placebo group (48% vs. 12%, P=0.01). Stool consistency improved significantly in the probiotics group compared with the placebo group. Percent changes in individual symptom scores were similar in the 2 groups, but IBS quality of life improvement tended to be higher in the probiotics group. Comparison of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles of fecal flora showed that the concordance rate between bacterial compositions before and after treatment was significantly higher in the probiotics group than in the placebo group (69.5% vs. 56.5%, P=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: The probiotic mixture was effective in providing AR of overall IBS symptoms and improvement of stool consistency in D-IBS patients, although it had no significant effect on individual symptoms. The therapeutic effect of probiotics is associated with the stabilization of intestinal microbiota.
TI  - The fate of indigenous microbiota, starter cultures, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua and Staphylococcus aureus in Danish raw milk and cheeses determined by pyrosequencing and quantitative real time (qRT)-PCR.
AB  - The purpose of this work was to study the bacterial communities in raw milk and in Danish raw milk cheeses using pyrosequencing of tagged amplicons of the V3 and V4 regions of the 16S rDNA and cDNA. Furthermore, the effects of acidification and ripening starter cultures, cooking temperatures and rate of acidification on survival of added Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua and Staphylococcus aureus in cheeses at different stages of ripening were studied by pyrosequencing and quantitative real time (qRT)-PCR. A high diversity of bacterial species was detected in raw milk. Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus rhamnosus were the main bacteria detected in raw milk and cheeses. Bacteria belonging to the genera Brevibacterium, Staphylococcus, Escherichia, Weissella, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus were also detected in both 16S rDNA and cDNA obtained from raw milk and cheeses. E. coli, which was added to milk used for production of some cheeses, was detected in both DNA and RNA extracted from cheeses at different stages of ripening showing the highest percentage of the total sequence reads at 7 days of ripening and decreased again in the later ripening stages. Growth of E. coli in cheeses appeared to be affected by the cooking temperature and the rate of acidification but not by the ripening starter cultures applied or the indigenous microbiota of raw milk. Growth of L. innocua and S. aureus added to milks was inhibited in all cheeses at different stages of ripening. The use of 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing and qRT-PCR allows a deeper understanding of the behavior of indigenous microbiota, starter cultures and pathogenic bacteria in raw milk and cheeses.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of different lactic acid bacteria strains.
AB  - Five lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains belonging to species Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus were tested for their susceptibility to 27 antibiotics. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of each antimicrobial were determined using a microdilution test. Among the strains a high susceptibility was detected for most of the cell-wall synthesis inhibitors (penicillins, cefoxitin and vancomycin) and resistance toward inhibitors of DNA synthesis (trimethoprim/sulfonamides and fluoroquinolones). Generally, the Lactobacillus strains were inhibited by antibiotics such as chloramphenicol, erythromycin and tetracycline at breakpoint levels lower or equal to the levels defined by the European Food Safety Authority. Despite the very similar profile of S. thermophilus LC201 to lactobacilli, the detection of resistance toward erythromycin necessitates the performance of additional tests in order to prove the absence of transferable resistance genes.
TI  - Genotyping of Streptococcus thermophilus strains isolated from traditional Egyptian dairy products by sequence analysis of the phosphoserine phosphatase (serB) gene with phenotypic characterizations of the strains.
AB  - AIMS: To develop a new, simplified genotyping method for examining the genetic diversity of Streptococcus thermophilus strains isolated from traditional Egyptian fermented dairy products and to characterize phenotypic traits of those strains related to their potential use in bioprocessing applications. METHODS AND RESULTS: A novel, simplified approach was developed for genotyping Strep. thermophilus involving the analysis of nucleotide sequence variations within a housekeeping gene encoding the phosphoserine phosphatase (SerB). Using this method, it was possible to identify ten genotypes involving diverse serB alleles among 54 Strep. thermophilus isolates cultured from Egyptian dairy products. These isolates harboured five de novo serB alleles that have not been detected in other Strep. thermophilus strains, deposited in a multilocus sequence typing (MLST) database. To assess distinct genotypes of the organism with phenotypic traits relevant to their potential use in industry, Strep. thermophilus strains were all subjected to a series of phenotypic characterizations. The strains were found to exhibit phenotypic diversity in terms of their ability to ferment lactose and galactose, express urease activity, produce exopolysaccharides and develop acidity. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of nucleotide sequence variations within the serB gene could serve as a suitable tool for probing diverse genotypes of Strep. thermophilus. Streptococcus thermophilus isolates associated with traditional Egyptian dairy products show high degree of genetic and phenotypic diversity. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study presents a novel, simplified procedure based on serB nucleotide sequencing for genotyping Strep. thermophilus. It also provides a pool of phenotypically diverse Strep. thermophilus cultures, from which certain strains could be selected for use in bioprocessing applications including the preparation of fermented dairy products.
TI  - The structure of an N11A mutant of the G-protein domain of FeoB.
AB  - The uptake of ferrous iron in prokaryotes is mediated by the G-protein-coupled membrane protein FeoB. The protein contains two N-terminal soluble domains that are together called `NFeoB'. One of these is a G-protein domain, and GTP hydrolysis by this domain is essential for iron transport. The GTPase activity of NFeoB is accelerated in the presence of potassium ions, which bind at a site adjacent to the nucleotide. One of the ligands at the potassium-binding site is a conserved asparagine residue, which corresponds to Asn11 in Streptococcus thermophilus NFeoB. The structure of an N11A S. thermophilus NFeoB mutant has been determined and refined to a resolution of 1.85 A; the crystals contained a mixture of mant-GDP-bound and mant-GMP-bound protein. The structure demonstrates how the use of a derivatized nucleotide in cocrystallization experiments can facilitate the growth of diffraction-quality crystals.
TI  - Construction of theta-type shuttle vector for Leuconostoc and other lactic acid bacteria using pCB42 isolated from kimchi.
AB  - The pCB42 plasmid from Leuconostoc citreum CB2567, a strain isolated from kimchi, was characterized, and a shuttle vector for Escherichia coli and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) was constructed. The pCB42 plasmid has a circular structure of 4312bp, a low G+C content, and no single-stranded DNA intermediates during replication, which indicates that pCB42 replicates via the theta-type replication mechanism. In silico analysis of this plasmid revealed 6 open reading frames: 1 transposase gene, 1 DNA-binding gene, 2 putative replication genes, and 2 unknown genes. The fragment encompassing ORF5 contains a functional plasmid replicon. This plasmid was capable of replicating in various LAB, including L. citreum, L. mesenteroides, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lb. reuteri, Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Weissella confusa, and Oenococcus oeni. The LAB-E. coli shuttle vector was constructed by ligating pCB42 and pEK104, and the resulting shuttle vector, pLeuCM42, showed a high segregational stability in L. citreum CB2567 after 100 generations of cell division. By using this shuttle vector, the beta-gal gene from Lb. plantarum was successfully expressed in the host strain, L. citreum CB2567. The pLeuCM42 shuttle vector can serve as a useful gene-delivery and expression tool for the genetic study or metabolic engineering of various strains of LAB.
TI  - Effects of copper on the post acidification of fermented milk by St. thermophilus.
AB  - As an initial investigation of using Cu(2)(+) to control post acidification, the  fermentation time, pH and the viable counts of bacteria of fermented milk during fermentation and storage were studied.Streptococcus thermophilus was used as the starter culture to ferment the whole milk. Cu(2)(+) was added to whole milk at a concentration ranging from 1.25 to 20 mg/kg before fermentation. It was observed that increasing the concentration of Cu(2)(+), the fermentation time of yoghurt was prolonged, while the post acidification of fermented milk was decreased during storage. The results showed that Cu(2)(+) at the concentration of 1.25 mg/kg could reduce the post acidification of fermented milk effectively and showed no significant effect on neither the fermentation time nor the viable counts of S. thermophilus (P > 0.05) compared with the control sample. These findings indicated that Cu(2)(+) could be used as a potential additive to inhibit the post acidification of yoghurt. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Adding copper to milk has an effect on fermented milk products such as yoghurt. Increasing the concentration of Cu2(+) decreased the post acidification of fermented milk. The fermentation time is prolonged with the increase of Cu2(+) concentration. Cu2(+) at 1.25 mg/kg exhibited inhibition on post acidification and had no significant effect on fermentation time and the viable counts of fermented milk.
TI  - Short communication: technological and genotypic comparison between Streptococcus macedonicus and Streptococcus thermophilus strains coming from the same dairy environment.
AB  - The species Streptococcus thermophilus is widely used for the preparation of several dairy products, and its technological contribution is clear. On the other hand, although Streptococcus macedonicus was first described more than 10 yr ago and, despite the scientific interest around this issue, the exact role of Strep. macedonicus in cheese making has yet to be clarified. In this study, 121 strains belonging to both species and isolated from the same dairy environment were genetically characterized by random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR and compared for the main biochemical features of technological interest, such as acid production, galactose utilization, citrate metabolism, exopolysaccharide production, and lipolytic, ureolytic, exocellular proteolytic, and decarboxylasic activities. Analysis by RAPD-PCR highlighted a remarkable genotypic heterogeneity among strains in both species, and, at a similarity level of 78%, all the isolates and reference strains of Strep. thermophilus grouped together and were well separated from the strains of Strep. macedonicus, confirming that these 2 species are different microbial entities. Comparison between genetic and phenotypic or biotechnological data did not reveal any relationships.
TI  - Intraspecific and interspecific interactions among proteins regulating exopolysaccharide synthesis in Streptococcus thermophilus, Streptococcus iniae, and Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris and the assessment of potential lateral gene transfer.
AB  - Using the yeast two-hybrid system, intraspecific protein interactions were detected in Streptococcus iniae and Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris between the transmembrane activation protein (CpsC and EpsA, respectively) and the protein tyrosine kinase (CpsD and EpsB, respectively), between two protein tyrosine kinases, and between the protein tyrosine kinase and the phosphotyrosine phosphatase (CpsB and EpsC, respectively). For each of these intraspecific interactions, interspecific interactions were also detected when one protein was from S. iniae and the other was from Streptococcus thermophilus . Interactions were also observed between two protein tyrosine kinases when one protein was from either of the Streptococcus species and the other from L. lactis subsp. cremoris. The results and sequence comparisons performed in this study support the conclusion that interactions among the components of the tyrosine kinase - phosphatase regulatory system are conserved in the order Lactobacillales and that interspecific genetic exchanges of the genes that encode these proteins have the potential to form functional recombinants. A better understanding of intraspecific and interspecific protein interactions involved in regulating exopolysaccharide biosynthesis may facilitate construction of improved strains for industrial uses as well as identification of factors needed to form functional regulatory complexes in naturally occurring recombinants.
TI  - Vector-mediated chromosomal integration of the glutamate decarboxylase gene in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The integrative vector, pINTRS, was used to transfer glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) activity to Streptococcus thermophilus ST128 thereby allowing for the production of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). In pINTRS, the gene encoding glutamate decarboxylase, gadB, was flanked by DNA fragments homologous to a S. thermophilus pseudogene to allow for integration at a non-essential locus on the chromosome. Screening techniques confirmed the insertion of gadB with either its endogenous promoter or the S. thermophilus P2201 promoter, resulting in the generation of recombinant strains, ST128/gadB or ST128/P2201-gadB. Following the integration event unwanted plasmid DNA, specifically the erythromycin resistance gene, was eliminated from the recombinant strains. Based on the production of GABA, activities of GAD for ST128/gadB and ST128/P2201-gadB were 30.6 +/- 6 and 27.9 +/- 7.2 muM/mg dry cell wt, respectively.
TI  - Variability of hydrolysis of beta-, alphas1-, and alphas2-caseins by 10 strains of Streptococcus thermophilus and resulting bioactive peptides.
AB  - Milk proteins contain numerous potential bioactive peptides, which may be released by digestive proteases or by the proteolytic system of lactic acid bacteria during food processing. The capacity of Streptococcus thermophilus to generate peptides, especially bioactive peptides, from bovine caseins was investigated. Strains expressing various levels of the cell envelope proteinase, PrtS, were incubated with alpha(s1)-, alpha(s2)-, or beta-casein. Analysis of the supernatants by LC-ESI-MS/MS showed that the beta-casein was preferentially hydrolyzed, followed by alpha(s2)-casein and then alpha(s1)-casein. Numbers and types of peptides released were strain-dependent. Hydrolysis appeared to be linked with the accessibility of different casein regions by protease. Analysis of bonds hydrolyzed in the region 1-23 of alpha(s1)-casein suggests that PrtS is at least in part responsible for the peptide production. Finally, among the generated peptides, 13 peptides from beta-casein, 5 from alpha(s2)-casein, and 2 from alpha(s1)-casein have been reported as bioactive, 15 of them being angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.
TI  - A suite of Switch I and Switch II mutant structures from the G-protein domain of  FeoB.
AB  - The acquisition of ferrous iron in prokaryotes is achieved by the G-protein-coupled membrane protein FeoB. This protein possesses a large C-terminal membrane-spanning domain preceded by two soluble cytoplasmic domains that are together termed 'NFeoB'. The first of these soluble domains is a GTPase domain (G-domain), which is then followed by an entirely alpha-helical domain. GTP hydrolysis by the G-domain is essential for iron uptake by FeoB, and various NFeoB mutant proteins from Streptococcus thermophilus have been constructed. These mutations investigate the role of conserved amino acids from the protein's critical Switch regions. Five crystal structures of these mutant proteins have been determined. The structures of E66A and E67A mutant proteins were solved in complex with nonhydrolyzable GTP analogues, the structures of T35A and E67A mutant proteins were solved in complex with GDP and finally the structure of the T35S mutant was crystallized without bound nucleotide. As an ensemble, the structures illustrate how small nucleotide-dependent rearrangements at the active site are converted into large rigid-body reorientations of the helical domain in response to GTP binding and hydrolysis. This provides the first evidence of nucleotide-dependent helical domain movement in NFeoB proteins, suggesting a mechanism by which the G-protein domain could structurally communicate with the membrane domain and mediate iron uptake.
TI  - Effect of daily consumption of probiotic yoghurt on lipid profiles in pregnant women: a randomized controlled clinical trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to enhanced fat storage primarily during the mid-pregnancy period, pregnancy is associated with elevated levels of lipid profiles. To our knowledge, no reports are available indicating the effects of probiotic yoghurt consumption on serum lipid profiles in pregnant women. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to determine the effects of daily consumption of probiotic yoghurt on lipid profiles of Iranian pregnant women. METHODS: This randomized single-blinded controlled clinical trial was performed among 70 pregnant women, primigravida, aged 18-30 years old who were carrying singleton pregnancy at their third trimester. Subjects were randomly assigned to consume 200 g/d of conventional (n=33) or the probiotic group (n=37) for 9 weeks. The probiotic yoghurt was a commercially available product prepared with the starter cultures of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus, enriched with probiotic culture of two strains of lactobacilli (Lactobacillus acidophilus LA5) and bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium animalis BB12) with a total of min 1 x 10(7) colony-forming units. The conventional yoghurt contained the starter cultures of S. thermophilus and L. bulgaricus. Fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and after 9-weeks intervention to measure serum lipid profiles. RESULTS: Although consumption of probiotic yogurt for 9 weeks had been resulted in a significant reduction in serum total- (-53.7 mg/dL, p=0.001), LDL- (-35.2 mg/dL, p=0.006) and HDL-cholesterol levels (-9.8 mg/dL, p=0.002) as well as serum triglyceride concentrations (-42.8 mg/dL, p=0.029), no significant differences were found comparing probiotic and conventional yogurts in terms of their effect on serum lipid profiles. Within-Group differences in conventional yogurt group revealed a significant reduction in HDL-cholesterol levels (-8.4 mg/dL, p=0.005) and borderline significant reduction in serum total cholesterol concentrations (-21.6 mg/dL, p=0.08). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, consumption of probiotic yogurt among pregnant women could not affect serum lipid profiles as compared to the conventional yogurt.
TI  - Probiotics can induce follicle maturational competence: the Danio rerio case.
AB  - In the present study, the effects of the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus IMC 501 on the acquisition of oocyte maturational competence was examined in zebrafish (Danio rerio). L. rhamnosus administration induced the responsiveness of incompetent follicles (stage IIIa) to 17,20-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one and their in vitro maturation. Acquisition of competence by the stage IIIa follicles was further validated by changes of lhr, mprb, inhbaa (activin betaA1), tgfb1, and gdf9 gene expression, which have recently emerged as key regulators of oocyte acquisition of maturational competence, and pou5f1 gene expression, which in other models has been shown to govern the establishment of developmental competence of oocytes. In addition, a DNA microarray experiment was conducted using the same follicles, and with relative gene ontology (GO) data analysis, the molecular effects of probiotic administration emerged. Molecular analysis using PCR-DGGE (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) approach, providing information about only the most abundant bacterial members of the microbial community, revealed that the probiotic was able to populate the gastrointestinal tract and modulate the microbial communities, causing a clear shift in them and specifically enhancing the presence of the lactic acid bacteria Streptococcus thermophilus. At the same time, PCR-DGGE analysis revealed that the probiotic was not directly associated with the ovaries. Finally, the effects of probiotic treatment on zebrafish follicle development were also analyzed by FPA (focal plane array) Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) imaging, a technique that provides the overall biochemical composition of samples. Changes were found above all in stage IIIa follicles from probiotic-exposed females; the modifications, observed in protein secondary structures as well as in hydration and in bands related to phosphate moieties, allowed us to hypothesize that probiotics act at this follicle stage, affecting the maturation phase.
TI  - A newly established bovine intestinal epithelial cell line is effective for in vitro screening of potential antiviral immunobiotic microorganisms for cattle.
AB  - We evaluated whether a bovine intestinal epithelial (BIE) cell line could serve as a useful in vitro model system for studying antiviral immune responses in bovine intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and for the primary screening of immunobiotic microorganisms with antiviral protective capabilities. Immunofluorescent analyses revealed that toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) was expressed in BIE cells, and the results of real-time quantitative PCR showed that these cells respond to stimulation with poly(I:C) by up-regulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I interferons. In addition, we demonstrated that BIE cells are useful for the primary screening of immunobiotic lactic acid bacteria strains which are able to beneficially modulate antiviral immune responses triggered by TLR3 activation in bovine IECs. The characterization of BIE cells performed in the present study represents an important step towards the establishment of a valuable bovine in vitro system that could be used for the development of immunomodulatory feed for bovine hosts.
TI  - Identification and characterisation of an iron-responsive candidate probiotic.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron is an essential cofactor in almost all biological systems. The lactic acid bacteria (LAB), frequently employed as probiotics, are unusual in having little or no requirement for iron. Iron in the human body is sequestered by transferrins and lactoferrin, limiting bacterial growth. An increase in the availability of iron in the intestine by bleeding, surgery, or under stress leads to an increase in the growth and virulence of many pathogens. Under these high iron conditions, LAB are rapidly out-competed; for the levels of probiotic bacteria to be maintained under high iron conditions they must be able to respond by increasing growth rate to compete with the normal flora. Despite this, iron-responsive genera are poorly characterised as probiotics. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we show that a panel of probiotics are not able to respond to increased iron availability, and identify an isolate of Streptococcus thermophilus that can increase growth rate in response to increased iron availability. The isolate of S. thermophilus selected was able to reduce epithelial cell death as well as NF-kappaB signalling and IL-8 production triggered by pathogens. It was capable of crossing an epithelial cell barrier in conjunction with E. coli and downregulating Th1 and Th17 responses in primary human intestinal leukocytes. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We propose that an inability to compete with potential pathogens under conditions of high iron availability such as stress and trauma may contribute to the lack of efficacy of many LAB-based probiotics in treating disease. Therefore, we offer an alternative paradigm which considers that probiotics should be able to be competitive during periods of intestinal bleeding, trauma or stress.
TI  - The impact of a consortium of fermented milk strains on the gut microbiome of gnotobiotic mice and monozygotic twins.
AB  - Understanding how the human gut microbiota and host are affected by probiotic bacterial strains requires carefully controlled studies in humans and in mouse models of the gut ecosystem where potentially confounding variables that are difficult to control in humans can be constrained. Therefore, we characterized the fecal microbiomes and metatranscriptomes of adult female monozygotic twin pairs through repeated sampling 4 weeks before, 7 weeks during, and 4 weeks after consumption of a commercially available fermented milk product (FMP) containing a consortium of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, two strains of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, and Streptococcus thermophilus. In addition, gnotobiotic mice harboring a 15-species model human gut microbiota whose genomes contain 58,399 known or predicted protein-coding genes were studied before and after gavage with all five sequenced FMP strains. No significant changes in bacterial species composition or in the proportional representation of genes encoding known enzymes were observed in the feces of humans consuming the FMP. Only minimal changes in microbiota configuration were noted in mice after single or repeated gavage with the FMP consortium. However, RNA-Seq analysis of fecal samples and follow-up mass spectrometry of urinary metabolites disclosed that introducing the FMP strains into mice results in significant changes in expression of microbiome-encoded enzymes involved in numerous metabolic pathways, most prominently those related to carbohydrate metabolism. B. animalis subsp. lactis, the dominant persistent member of the FMP consortium in gnotobiotic mice, up-regulates a locus in vivo that is involved in the catabolism of xylooligosaccharides, a class of glycans widely distributed in fruits, vegetables, and other foods, underscoring the importance of these sugars to this bacterial species. The human fecal metatranscriptome exhibited significant changes, confined to the period of FMP consumption, that mirror changes in gnotobiotic mice, including those related to plant polysaccharide metabolism. These experiments illustrate a translational research pipeline for characterizing the effects of FMPs on the human gut microbiome.
TI  - Reverse transcription quantitative PCR revealed persistency of thermophilic lactic acid bacteria metabolic activity until the end of the ripening of Emmental cheese.
AB  - For Emmental manufacture two kinds of adjunct culture are added: (i) thermophilic lactic acid bacteria (starters) such as Lactobacillus helveticus (LH), and Streptococcus thermophilus (ST) growing the first day of the manufacture and (ii) ripening culture. ST and LH have a key role in curd acidification and proteolysis at the beginning of the manufacture but are considered to be lyzed for a great part of them at the ripening step. The aim of this work was to assess the metabolic activity of these bacteria throughout manufacture and ripening. During Emmental cheesemaking, LH and ST were subjected to i) population quantification by numerations and by quantitative PCR (qPCR) ii) reverse transcription (RT) Temporal Temperature Gel Electrophoresis (TTGE) iii) transcript quantification by RT-qPCR targeting 16S rRNA, tuf and groL mRNAs to evaluate bacterial metabolic activity. During ripening, ST and LH numerations showed a 2.5 log(10) loss of culturability whereas qPCR on pelleted cells revealed only one log(10) of decrease for both of these species. 10(9) ST and 10(8) LH cells/g of cheese still remained. They contained a stable number of 16S transcript and at least 10(6) copies of mRNAs per 10(9) cells until the end of ripening. These results prove the unexpected persistency of thermophilic lactic acid bacteria starters (ST and LH) metabolic activity until the end of ripening and open new perspectives in term of their involvement in the quality of cheeses during ripening.
TI  - Differential regulation of two closely related integrative and conjugative elements from Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Two closely related ICEs, ICESt1 and ICESt3, have been identified in  the lactic acid bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus. While their conjugation and recombination modules are almost identical (95% nucleotide identity) and their regulation modules related, previous work has demonstrated that transconjugants carrying ICESt3 were generated at rate exceeding by a 1000 factor that of ICESt1. RESULTS: The functional regulation of ICESt1 and ICESt3 transcription, excision and replication were investigated under different conditions (exponential growth or stationary phase, DNA damage by exposition to mitomycin C). Analysis revealed an identical transcriptional organization of their recombination and conjugation modules (long unique transcript) whereas the transcriptional organization of their regulation modules were found to be different (two operons in ICESt1 but only one in ICESt3) and to depend on the conditions (promoter specific of stationary phase in ICESt3). For both elements, stationary phase and DNA damage lead to the rise of transcript levels of the conjugation-recombination and regulation modules. Whatever the growth culture conditions, excision of ICESt1 was found to be lower than that of ICESt3, which is consistent with weaker transfer frequencies. Furthermore, for both elements, excision increases in stationary phase (8.9-fold for ICESt1 and 1.31-fold for ICESt3) and is strongly enhanced by DNA damage (38-fold for ICESt1 and 18-fold for ICESt3). Although ICEs are generally not described as replicative elements, the copy number of ICESt3 exhibited a sharp increase (9.6-fold) after mitomycin C exposure of its harboring strain CNRZ385. This result was not observed when ICESt3 was introduced in a strain deriving ICESt1 host strain CNRZ368, deleted for this element. This finding suggests an impact of the host cell on ICE behavior. CONCLUSIONS: All together, these results suggest a novel mechanism of regulation shared by ICESt1, ICESt3 and closely related ICEs, which we identified by analysis of recently sequenced genomes of firmicutes. This is the first report of a partial shutdown of the activity of an ICE executed by a strain belonging to its primary host species. The sharp increase of ICESt3 copy number suggests an induction of replication; such conditional intracellular replication may be common among ICEs.
TI  - The fast milk acidifying phenotype of Streptococcus thermophilus can be acquired  by natural transformation of the genomic island encoding the cell-envelope proteinase PrtS.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In industrial fermentation processes, the rate of milk acidification  by Streptococcus thermophilus is of major technological importance. The cell-envelope proteinase PrtS was previously shown to be a key determinant of the milk acidification activity in this species. The PrtS enzyme is tightly anchored to the cell wall via a mechanism involving the typical sortase A (SrtA) and initiates the breakdown of milk casein into small oligopeptides. The presence or absence of PrtS divides the S. thermophilus strains into two phenotypic groups i.e. the slow and the fast acidifying strains. The aim of this study was to improve the milk acidification rate of slow S. thermophilus strains, and hence optimise the fermentation process of dairy products. RESULTS: In the present work, we developed for the first time a strategy based on natural transformation to confer the rapid acidification phenotype to slow acidifying starter strains of S. thermophilus. First, we established by gene disruption that (i) prtS, encoding the cell-envelope proteinase, is a key factor responsible for rapid milk acidification in fast acidifying strains, and that (ii) srtA, encoding sortase A, is not absolutely required to express the PrtS activity. Second, a 15-kb PCR product encompassing the prtS genomic island was transferred by natural transformation using the competence-inducing peptide in three distinct prtS-defective genetic backgrounds having or not a truncated sortase A gene. We showed that in all cases the milk acidification rate of transformants was significantly increased, reaching a level similar to that of wild-type fast acidifying strains. Furthermore, it appeared that the prtS-encoded activity does not depend on the prtS copy number or on its chromosomal integration locus. CONCLUSION: We have successfully used natural competence to transfer the prtS locus encoding the cell-envelope proteinase in three slow acidifying strains of S. thermophilus, allowing their conversion into fast acidifying derivatives. The efficient protocol developed in this article will provide the dairy industry with novel and optimised S. thermophilus starter strains.
TI  - Specialized adaptation of a lactic acid bacterium to the milk environment: the comparative genomics of Streptococcus thermophilus LMD-9.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus thermophilus represents the only species among the streptococci that has "Generally Regarded As Safe" status and that plays an economically important role in the fermentation of yogurt and cheeses. We conducted comparative genome analysis of S. thermophilus LMD-9 to identify unique gene features as well as features that contribute to its adaptation to the dairy environment. In addition, we investigated the transcriptome response of LMD-9 during growth in milk in the presence of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, a companion culture in yogurt fermentation, and during lytic bacteriophage infection. RESULTS: The S. thermophilus LMD-9 genome is comprised of a 1.8 Mbp circular chromosome (39.1% GC; 1,834 predicted open reading frames) and two small cryptic plasmids. Genome comparison with the previously sequenced LMG 18311 and CNRZ1066 strains revealed 114 kb of LMD-9 specific chromosomal region, including genes that encode for histidine biosynthetic pathway, a cell surface proteinase, various host defense mechanisms and a phage remnant. Interestingly, also unique to LMD-9 are genes encoding for a putative mucus-binding protein, a peptide transporter, and exopolysaccharide biosynthetic proteins that have close orthologs in human intestinal microorganisms. LMD-9 harbors a large number of pseudogenes (13% of ORFeome), indicating that like LMG 18311 and CNRZ1066, LMD-9 has also undergone major reductive evolution, with the loss of carbohydrate metabolic genes and virulence genes found in their streptococcal counterparts. Functional genome distribution analysis of ORFeomes among streptococci showed that all three S. thermophilus strains formed a distinct functional cluster, further establishing their specialized adaptation to the nutrient-rich milk niche. An upregulation of CRISPR1 expression in LMD-9 during lytic bacteriophage DT1 infection suggests its protective role against phage invasion. When co-cultured with L. bulgaricus, LMD-9 overexpressed genes involved in amino acid transport and metabolism as well as DNA replication. CONCLUSIONS: The genome of S. thermophilus LMD-9 is shaped by its domestication in the dairy environment, with gene features that conferred rapid growth in milk, stress response mechanisms and host defense systems that are relevant to its industrial applications. The presence of a unique exopolysaccharide gene cluster and cell surface protein orthologs commonly associated with probiotic functionality revealed potential probiotic applications of LMD-9.
TI  - Transcriptome analysis of adaptive heat shock response of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus, a gram-positive facultative anaerobe, is one of the most important lactic acid bacteria widely used in the dairy fermentation industry. In this study, we have analyzed the global transcriptional profiling of S. thermophilus upon temperature change. During a temperature shift from 42 degrees C to 50 degrees C, it is found that 196 (10.4%) genes show differential expression with 102 up-regulated and 94 down-regulated at 50 degrees C. In particular, 1) Heat shock genes, such as DnaK, GroESL and clpL, are identified to be elevated at 50 degrees C; 2) Transcriptional regulators, such as HrcA, CtsR, Fur, MarR and MerR family, are differentially expressed, indicating the complex molecular mechanisms of S. thermophilus adapting to heat shock; 3) Genes associated with signal transduction, cell wall genes, iron homeostasis, ABC transporters and restriction-modification system were induced; 4) A large number of the differentially expressed genes are hypothetical genes of unknown function, indicating that much remains to be investigated about the heat shock response of S. thermophilus. Experimental investigation of selected heat shock gene ClpL shows that it plays an important role in the physiology of S. thermophilus at high temperature and meanwhile we confirmed ClpL as a member of the CtsR regulon. Overall, this study has contributed to the underlying adaptive molecular mechanisms of S. thermophilus upon temperature change and provides a basis for future in-depth functional studies.
TI  - Enhanced extraction of heavy metals in the two-step process with the mixed culture of Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - For biological extraction of heavy metals from chromated copper arsenate (CCA) treated wood, different bacteria were investigated. The extraction rates of heavy metals using Lactobacillusbulgaricus and Streptococcusthermophilus were highest. The chemical extraction rates were depended on the amounts of pyruvic acid and lactic acid. Especially, the extraction rates using mixed pyruvic acid and lactic acid were increased compared to those of sole one. They were also enhanced in the mixed culture of L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus. To improve the extraction of CCA, a two-step processing procedure with the mixed culture of L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus was conducted. A maximum of 93% of copper, 86.5% of chromium, and 97.8% of arsenic were extracted after 4 days. These results suggest that a two-step process with the mixed culture of L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus is most effective to extract heavy metals from CCA treated wood.
TI  - Effect of a probiotic on liver aminotransferases in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease patients: a double blind randomized clinical trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The present pilot trial was carried out to evaluate the effects of an  acute treatment with a mixture containing 500 million of Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus per day in patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). RESEARCH METHODS: A sample of 30 patients with NAFLD (diagnosed by liver biopsy) was enrolled and 28 patients were analyzed in a double blind randomized clinical trial. Patients were randomized to one of the following treatments during 3 months: group I, treated with one tablet per day with 500 million of Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus and group II, treated with one placebo tablet (120 mg of starch). RESULTS: In group I, alanine amino transferase (ALT: 67.7 +/- 25.1 vs. 60.4 +/- 30.4 UI/L; p < 0.05), aspartate aminotransferase activity (AST: 41.3 +/- 15.5 vs. 35.6 +/- 10.4 UI/L; p < 0.05) and gammaglutamine transferase levels (gammaGT: 118.2 +/- 63.1 vs. 107.7 +/- 60.8 UI/L; p < 0.05) decreased. In group II, all liver function parameters remained unchanged (ALT: 60.7 +/- 32.1 vs. 64.8 +/- 35.5 UI/L; p < 0.05), aspartate aminotransferase activity (AST: 31.7 +/- 13.1 vs. 36.4 +/- 13.8 UI/L; ns) and gammaglutamine transferase levels (gammaGT: 82.1 +/- 55.1 vs. 83.6 +/- 65.3 UI/L; ns). Anthropometric parameters and cardiovascular risk factors remained unchanged after treatment in both groups. CONCLUSION: A tablet of 500 million of Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus, with a randomized clinical design, improved liver aminotransferases levels in patients with NAFLD.
TI  - Streptococcus thermophilus ST28 ameliorates colitis in mice partially by suppression of inflammatory Th17 cells.
AB  - The effects of Streptococcus thermophilus ST28 on cytokine production by murine splenocytes stimulated with transforming growth factor-beta plus interleukin- (IL-) 6 were evaluated. The addition of ST28 significantly repressed IL-17 production compared to ATCC 19258 (type strain). ST28 also decreased the number of Th17 cells in the stimulated splenocytes. The anti-inflammatory effects of ST28 administration were evaluated in mice with colitis induced by dextran sodium sulphate (DSS). Oral treatment of mice with ST28 ameliorated the intestinal lesions by DSS. Upon DSS treatment, IL-17 production in lamina propria lymphocytes (LPLs) was induced, but ST28 significantly decreased its production. ST28 also decreased the percentage of Th17 cells in LPL from DSS-induced colitis. The present results imply that ST28 suppresses the Th17 response in inflamed intestines and would be useful in the treatment of Th17-mediated diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease.
TI  - Physicochemical, microbiological and sensory profiles of fermented milk containing probiotic strains isolated from kefir.
AB  - A two-strain starter culture containing Lactobacillus plantarum CIDCA 83114, a potential probiotic strain isolated from kefir grains, and Streptococcus thermophilus CIDCA 321 was tested for the preparation of a fermented milk product. Kluyveromyces marxianus CIDCA 8154, a yeast with immunomodulatory properties was included to formulate a three-strain starter culture. Supernatants of enterohaemorragic Escherichia coli, shiga-toxin-producing strain, along with a two-strain or a three-strain starter culture were included in the medium of Vero-cell surface cultures. The results demonstrated that these combinations of microorganisms antagonize the cytopathic action of shiga toxins. The cell concentration of Lb. plantarum did not decrease during fermentation, indicating that the viability of this strain was not affected by low pH, nor did the number of viable bacteria change during 21 days of storage in either fermented products. The number of viable yeasts increases during fermentation and storage. Trained assessors analyzed the general acceptability of fresh fermented milks and considered both acceptable. The milk fermented with the two-strain starter culture was considered acceptable after two week of storage, while the product fermented with the three-strain starter culture remained acceptable for less than one week. The main changes in sensory attributes detected by the trained panel were in sour taste, milky taste and also in fermented attributes. The correlation between different sensory attributes and acceptability indicated that the panel was positively influenced by milky attributes (taste, odour, and flavour) as well as the intensity of flavour. In conclusion, the two-strain starter culture would be the more promising alternative for inclusion of that potential probiotic lactobacillus in a fermented milk product.
TI  - Probiotics for prevention and treatment of diarrhea.
AB  - Probiotics have been extensively studied over the past several years in the prevention and, to a larger extent, in the treatment of diarrheal diseases, especially in pediatric populations. Diarrhea is a symptom, and not a disease. This review will not address chronic disorders associated with diarrhea, or Clostridium difficile-induced diarrhea. Rather it will focus on published clinical trials performed on acute-onset, likely infectious diarrhea occurring in the settings of day-care centers, in the community, acquired in the hospital, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and treatment of acute infectious diarrhea. For prevention of diarrhea acquired in day-care centers, 9 randomized and placebo-controlled trials have been published, conducted in different parts of the world. Probiotics tested were Lactobacillus GG, Bifidobacterium lactis (alone or in combination with Streptococcus thermophilus, and Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus (not GG), and Lactobacillus acidophilus, in various trials either alone or in comparison with each other. The evidence of their efficacy in these settings is only modest for the prevention of diarrhea, although somewhat better for prevention of upper respiratory infections. In the community, new trails conducted in underprivileged areas of India, again with modest efficacy. Previous trials that examined the potential role of probiotics in preventing the spreading of diarrhea in hospitalized children had yielded conflicting results. More recently, a large trial in Poland showed, however, rather good evidence of efficacy for Lactobacillus GG. The prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea has been the subject of many investigations, both in children and in adults. Most commonly used probiotics were Lactobacillus GG, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Bifidobacterium ssp, Streptococcus ssp, and the yeast Saccharomyces boulardii. In general, most of these trials do show clear evidence of efficacy, with the 2 most effective strains being Lactobacillus GG and S. boulardii. Evidence is also emerging on the importance of the dose in reducing the incidence of this type of diarrhea, and the incidence of Clostridium difficile-associated postantibiotic diarrhea. As for treatment, a large body of data is available, especially in children, on the effect of several strains of probiotics in treating sporadic infectious diarrhea. The vast majority of the published trials show a statistically significant benefit and moderate clinical benefit of a few, well-identified probiotic strains-mostly Lactobacillus GG and S. boulardii-in the treatment of acute watery diarrhea, and particularly those due to rotavirus. Such a beneficial effect results, on average, in a reduction of diarrhea duration of approximately 1 day. The effect is strain-dependent and dose-dependent.
TI  - Production of multiple bacteriocins from a single locus by gastrointestinal strains of Lactobacillus salivarius.
AB  - Bacteriocins produced by Lactobacillus salivarius isolates derived from a gastrointestinal origin have previously demonstrated efficacy for in vivo protection against Listeria monocytogenes infection. In this study, comparative genomic analysis was employed to investigate the intraspecies diversity of seven L. salivarius isolates of human and porcine intestinal origin, based on the genome of the well-characterized bacteriocin-producing strain L. salivarius UCC118. This revealed a highly conserved megaplasmid-borne gene cluster in these strains involved in the regulation and secretion of two-component class IIb bacteriocins. However, considerable intraspecific variation was observed in the structural genes encoding the bacteriocin peptides. They ranged from close relatives of abp118, such as salivaricin P, which differs by 2 amino acids, to completely novel bacteriocins, such as salivaricin T, which is characterized in this study. Salivaricin T inhibits closely related lactobacilli and bears little homology to previously characterized salivaricins. Interestingly, the two peptides responsible for salivaricin T activity, SalTalpha and SalTbeta, share considerable identity with the component peptides of thermophilin 13, a bacteriocin produced by Streptococcus thermophilus. Furthermore, the salivaricin locus of strain DPC6488 also encodes an additional novel one-component class IId anti-listerial bacteriocin, salivaricin L. These findings suggest a high level of redundancy in the bacteriocins that can be produced by intestinal L. salivarius isolates using the same enzymatic production and export machinery. Such diversity may contribute to their ability to dominate and compete within the complex microbiota of the mammalian gut.
TI  - The rgg0182 gene encodes a transcriptional regulator required for the full Streptococcus thermophilus LMG18311 thermal adaptation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus thermophilus is an important starter strain for the production of yogurt and cheeses. The analysis of sequenced genomes of four strains of S. thermophilus indicates that they contain several genes of the rgg familly potentially encoding transcriptional regulators. Some of the Rgg proteins are known to be involved in bacterial stress adaptation. RESULTS: In this study, we demonstrated that Streptococcus thermophilus thermal stress adaptation required the rgg0182 gene which transcription depends on the culture medium and the growth temperature. This gene encoded a protein showing similarity with members of the Rgg family transcriptional regulator. Our data confirmed that Rgg0182 is a transcriptional regulator controlling the expression of its neighboring genes as well as chaperones and proteases encoding genes. Therefore, analysis of a Deltargg0182 mutant revealed that this protein played a role in the heat shock adaptation of Streptococcus thermophilus LMG18311. CONCLUSIONS: These data showed the importance of the Rgg0182 transcriptional regulator on the survival of S. thermophilus during dairy processes and more specifically during changes in temperature.
TI  - Characterization of Streptococcus thermophilus two-component systems: In silico analysis, functional analysis and expression of response regulator genes in pure or mixed culture with its yogurt partner, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus.
AB  - The lactic acid bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus (S. thermophilus) is widely  used in the dairy industry. As a food bacterium, it has to cope with changing environments such as milk, yogurt, as well as the digestive tract, after the product has been ingested. In bacteria, two-component systems (TCS) are one of the most prevalent mechanisms to sense and respond appropriately to a wide range of signals. They are typically composed of a sensor kinase (HK) that detects a stimulus and a response regulator (RR) which acts as a transcriptional regulator. Our objective was to make an inventory of the TCS present in S. thermophilus LMD-9 and investigate the contribution of each TCS to LMD-9 growth in milk. For that purpose, we performed in silico, transcriptomic as well as functional analysis. The LMD-9 genome presented 6 complete TCS with both HK and RR (TCS 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9) and 2 orphan RRs (RR01 and 08) with truncated HK. Our in silico analysis revealed that for 5 TCS out of the 8, orthologs with known functions were found in other bacterial species whereas for TCS02, 4 and 6 the function of the orthologs are unidentified. Transcriptomic studies (using quantitative PCR) revealed that all S. thermophilus LMD-9 response regulator genes were expressed in milk; they were expressed at different levels and with different profiles during growth. In mixed culture with Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (L. bulgaricus), the S. thermophilus partner in yogurt, the expression of four S. thermophilus LMD-9 response regulator increased; two of them, rr02 and rr09, increased by a factor of 6. These results indicate that the presence of L. bulgaricus induces regulatory changes in S. thermophilus. We also demonstrated that a response regulator (rr02) can exert its regulatory function on its target genes even when expressed at very low levels. We showed that RR05-an ortholog of Bacillus subtilis YycF or Staphylococcus aureus WalR-was essential for the growth of S. thermophilus. For the 7 other RRs, the absence of a single response regulator gene was insufficient to notably impact the growth of LMD-9 in milk, with or without supplementation with purines, formate, or stress agents (lactate, H(2)O(2)). We demonstrated here that the 8 response regulators of LMD-9 are expressed--and thus potentially active--during growth in milk and suggested that the response regulators have possibly overlapping regulons and/or functions not essential under the conditions tested.
TI  - Microchip electrophoresis of bacteria using lipid-based liquid crystalline nanoparticles.
AB  - The aggregation and adhesion of bacterial cells is a serious disadvantage for electrophoretic separations of bacteria. In this study, lipid-based liquid crystalline nanoparticles were used as a pseudostationary phase to minimise the bacterial aggregation and adsorption to the inner walls of microchannels. Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus rhamnosus were selected as analytes and were separated by microchip electrophoresis (MCE) with laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detection using 4.5 mM tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (TRIS)-4.5 mM boric acid-0.1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) (TBE) containing poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and lipid-based nanoparticles as the running buffer. The mechanism of lipid-based nanoparticles affecting bacterial adhesion and aggregation was discussed and supported by zeta potential experiments. Under the optimal conditions, the three species of bacteria were identified with patterned peaks. This proposed MCE method using lipid-based nanoparticles as running buffer additives was also used to analyse a real yogurt sample, and valuable bacterial information was obtained by the electropherograms.
TI  - A novel biosensor based on Lactobacillus acidophilus for determination of phenolic compounds in milk products and wastewater.
AB  - Different branches of industry need to use phenolic compounds (PCs) in their production, so determination of PCs sensitively, accurately, rapidly, and economically is very important. For the sensitive determination of PCs, some biosensors based on pure polyphenol oxidase, plant tissue and microorganisms were developed before. But there has been no study to develop a microbial phenolic compounds biosensor based on Lactobacillus species, which contain polyphenol oxidase enzyme. In this study, we used different forms of Lactobacillus species as enzyme sources of biosensor and compared biosensor performances of these forms for determination of PCs. For this purpose, we used lyophilized Lactobacillus cells (containing L. bulgaricus, L. acidophilus, Streptococcus thermophilus), pure L. acidophilus, pure L. bulgaricus, and L. acidophilus- and L. bulgaricus adapted to catechol in Lactobacilli MRS Broth. The most suitable form was determined and optimization studies of the biosensor were carried out by using this form. For preparing the bioactive layer of the biosensor, the Lactobacillus cells were immobilized in gelatin by using glutaraldehyde. In the study, we used catechol as a substrate. Phenolic compound determination is based on the assay of the differences on the respiration activity of the cells on the oxygen meter in the absence and the presence of catechol. The microbial biosensor response depends directly on catechol concentration between 0.5 and 5.0 mM with 18 min response time. In the optimization studies of the microbial biosensor the most suitable microorganism amount was found to be 10 mg, and also phosphate buffer (pH 8.0; 50 mM) and 37.5 degrees C were obtained as the optimum working conditions. In the characterization studies of the microbial biosensor some parameters such as substrate specificity on the biosensor response and operational and storage stability were examine. Furthermore, the determination of PC levels in synthetic wastewater, industrial wastewater, and milk products was investigated by using the developed biosensor under optimum conditions.
TI  - Effect of freeze drying process on some properties of Streptococcus thermophilus  isolated from dairy products.
AB  - The present investigation represents the effect of freeze drying on some properties as acid and bile tolerance of Streptococcus thermophilus MTCC 1938 culture isolated from dairy products. The cell paste obtained from milk based medium was freeze dried with a pressure of 50-100 mtorr for 24h at -40 degrees C. Acid and bile tolerance test exhibited 3.8-4.9 and 3.2-3.8 log counts reduction after freeze drying respectively.
TI  - Growth and exopolysaccharide production by Streptococcus thermophilus ST1 in skim milk.
AB  - To analyze the exopolysaccharide (EPS) production by Streptococcus thermophilus ST1, cultures were cultivated in 10% (w/v) reconstituted skim milk under different growth conditions including various temperatures and pHs of growth medium, supplementation of the medium with various carbon sources (glucose, lactose, sucrose, galactose and fructose) and nitrogen source (whey protein concentrate, or WPC). The results showed that most EPS production by strain ST1 was obtained at a temperature (42 degrees C) and pH (6.5) optimal for its growth. Supplementation of the skim milk medium with either carbohydrates or WPC increased both growth and polymer formation by different extents, with sucrose being most effective among the carbon sources tested. Under the optimal cultural conditions, i.e. pH 6.5, 42 degrees C with 2% (w/v) sucrose and 0.5% (w/v) WPC, 135.80 mg l(-1) of EPS was produced by strain ST1. The monosaccharide composition of the EPS was determined to be glucose and galactose (2:1), and the molecular mass of the EPS was 3.97 x 10(6) Da. The aqueous solution of the EPS at 1% (w/v) showed relatively high viscosity, indicating the potential of this EPS-producing S. thermophilus strain for applications in the improvement of physical properties of fermented milk products.
TI  - Enumeration of bifidobacteria using Petrifilm AC in pure cultures and in a fermented milk manufactured with a commercial culture of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Bifidobacteria are probiotic microorganisms that are widely used in the food industry. With the aim of using of Petrifilm Aerobic Count (AC) plates associated with selective culture media, aliquots of sterile skim milk were inoculated separately with four commercial cultures of bifidobacteria. These cultures were plated by both the conventional method and PetrifilmAC, using the culture media NNLP and ABC. The cultures were incubated under anaerobiosis at 37 degrees C for 24, 48 and 72 h. No significant differences (p > 0.05) were observed between the obtained counts at 48 and 72 h. Bifidobacteria counts in ABC were usually higher than in NNLP, independent of the plating method. Subsequently, fermented milk was prepared with a Streptococcus thermophilus strain, and aliquots were inoculated with the same bifidobacteria. Then, the fermented milks were submitted to microbiological analysis for bifidobacteria enumeration using the same culture media and methodologies previously described, incubated under anaerobiosis at 37 degrees C for 48 h. Again, bifidobacteria counts in ABC were higher than in NNLP, with significant differences for some cultures (p < 0.05). The counts obtained by both methodologies presented significant correlations (p < 0.05). The results indicate the viability of PetrifilmAC as an alternative method for bifidobacteria enumeration when associated to specific culture media, specially the ABC.
TI  - Complete genome sequence of the pigmented Streptococcus thermophilus strain JIM8232.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus is a dairy species commonly used in the manufacture of cheese and yogurt. Here, we report the complete sequence of S. thermophilus strain JIM8232, isolated from milk and which produces a yellow pigment, an atypical trait for this bacterium.
TI  - Utilization of UF-permeate for production of beta-galactosidase by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Four lactobacilli strains (Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacilus casei and Lactobacillus reuteri) were grown in MRS broth and three lactococci strains (Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis subsp. Lactis and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis biovar. diacetilactis) were grown in M17 broth. L. reuteri and S. thermophilus were chosen on the basis of the best mean beta-galactosidase activity of 10.44 and 10.01 U/ml respectively, for further studies on permeate-based medium. The maximum production of beta-galactosidase by L. reuteri was achieved at lactose concentration of 6%, initial pH 5.0-7.5, ammonium phosphate as nitrogen source at a concentration of 0.66 g N/L and incubation temperature at 30 degrees C/24 hrs to give 6.31 U/ml. While in case of S. thermophilus, maximum beta-galactosidase production was achieved at 10% lactose concentration of permeate medium, supplemented with phosphate buffer ratio of 0.5:0.5 (KH2PO4:K2HPO4, g/L), at initial pH 6.0-6.5, ammonium phosphate (0.66g N/L) as nitrogen source and incubation temperature 35 degrees C for 24 hrs to give 7.85 U/ml.
TI  - Suppression of Th17 response by Streptococcus thermophilus ST28 through induction of IFN-gamma.
AB  - The proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-17 plays important roles in various inflammatory diseases, and IL-17-producing T helper 17 cells (Th17) have received much attention. For therapy of Th17-mediated diseases, some reports have indicated the clinical efficacy of lactic acid bacteria, including Streptococcus thermophilus. In this study, we examined the mechanism for the suppressive effects of S. thermophilus ST28 on the Th17 response in murine splenocytes stimulated with transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta plus IL-6. Stimulation with TGF-beta plus IL-6 increased mRNA expression of IL-17 and its production in the splenocytes, but ST28 markedly suppressed both. Meanwhile, ST28 increased the mRNA expression of interferon (IFN)-gamma as well as its production. Anti-IFN-gamma completely cancelled the suppressive effect of ST28 on IL-17 production. From these data, it was concluded that IFN-gamma induced by ST28 had an important role on the effect. A genomic DNA (10 microg/ml) from ST28 effectively suppressed IL-17 production, probably via the Toll-like receptor 9. Therefore, modulation of Th1/Th17 balance would be one of the mechanisms under which S. thermophilus ST28 exerts an anti-inflammatory effect.
TI  - The initiation of GTP hydrolysis by the G-domain of FeoB: insights from a transition-state complex structure.
AB  - The polytopic membrane protein FeoB is a ferrous iron transporter in prokaryotes. The protein contains a potassium-activated GTPase domain that is essential in regulating the import of iron and conferring virulence to many disease-causing bacteria. However, the mechanism by which the G-domain of FeoB hydrolyzes GTP is not well understood. In particular, it is not yet known how the pivotal step in GTP hydrolysis is achieved: alignment of a catalytic water molecule. In the current study, the crystal structure of the soluble domains from Streptococcus thermophilus FeoB (NFeoB(St)) in complex with the activating potassium ion and a transition-state analogue, GDPAlF(4) (-), reveals a novel mode of water alignment involving contacts with the protein backbone only. In parallel to the structural studies, a series of seven mutant proteins were constructed that targeted conserved residues at the active site of NFeoB(St), and the nucleotide binding and hydrolysis properties of these were measured and compared to the wild-type protein. The results show that mutations in Thr35 abolish GTPase activity of the protein, while other conserved residues (Tyr58, Ser64, Glu66 and Glu67) are not required for water alignment by NFeoB(St). Together with the crystal structure, the findings suggest a new mechanism for hydrolysis initiation in small G-proteins, in which the attacking water molecule is aligned by contacts with the protein backbone only.
TI  - Classification of Swiss cheese starter and adjunct cultures using Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy.
AB  - The acceptability of Swiss cheese largely depends on the flavor profile, and strain variations of cheese cultures will affect the final quality. Conventional biochemical methods to identify the cultures at the strain level are time-consuming and expensive, and require skilled labor. Our objective was to develop rapid classification methods of starter cultures at the strain level by using a combination of hydrophobic grid membrane filters and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Forty-four pulsed-field gel electrophoresis-verified strains of starter and nonstarter cultures including Streptococcus thermophilus, Propionibacterium freudenreichii, and Lactobacillus spp. were analyzed. The strains were grown on their respective agar media, transferred to broth media, and incubated. Then, cultures were centrifuged and the pellets were resuspended in saline solution (10 muL). Aliquots (2 muL) of the suspended bacterial solution were placed onto a grid of the hydrophobic grid membrane filters, having 6 grids per each strain analyzed. The dried filters were read by FTIR microspectroscopy fitted with an attenuated total reflectance probe. Collected spectra were statistically analyzed by a soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA) for pattern recognition. Classification models were developed for Streptococcus thermophilus, Propionibacterium freudenreichii, and Lactobacillus spp. strains. The models showed major discrimination in the spectral region from 1,200 to 900 cm(-1) associated with signals from phosphate-containing compounds and various polysaccharides in the cell wall. The developed method allowed for rapid classification of several Swiss cheese starter and nonstarter cultures at the strain level. This information provides a detailed overview of microbiological status, which would enable corrective measures to be taken early in the cheese making process, limiting production of inferior quality cheese and minimizing defects. This method could be an effective tool to identify and monitor activity of cheese and other dairy starter cultures.
TI  - Culture-independent detection of microorganisms in traditional Slovakian bryndza  cheese.
AB  - In order to investigate the microflora of Slovakian bryndza cheese (a cheese containing unpasteurized or pasteurized ewes' milk component) by a culture-independent method, DNA was extracted directly from 7 bryndza samples and analysed by an innovative method. Using the universal prokaryotic and fungal primers, ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions with variable length were amplified. The standard universal reverse primer L1 aligning to bacterial 23s rDNA was found unsuitable for some lactic acid bacteria and other species based on in silico analysis. Therefore, L1 primer was replaced by a combination of novel primers GplusR and GminusR aligning to the adjacent, more conserved DNA region. The amplification profiles were visualised by both standard electrophoresis and by fluorescent capillary gel electrophoresis. From representative samples, major amplicons were excised from the gel, cloned and sequenced. Sequencing revealed that the samples contained Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus brevis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus raffinolactis, Streptococcus macedonicus, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Debaromyces hansenii, Mucor fragilis, Yarrowia lipolytica and Galactomyces geotrichum. These results represent an extension of the knowledge on the microflora of Slovakian bryndza cheese. The introduced automated ribosomal DNA intergenic spacer analysis of the bacterial and fungal genomes proved to be very effective in the application of studying microflora of cheese.
TI  - Effect of grape polyphenols on lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria growth: resistance and metabolism.
AB  - Food polyphenols are able to selectively modify the growth of susceptible micro-organisms. This study describes the effect of a flavan-3-ol enriched grape seed extract (GSE) on the growth of several lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and bifidobacteria and the ability of the resistant strains to metabolize these compounds. Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus vaginalis strains showed a remarkable sensitivity to the phenolic extracts assayed, including a GSE fraction consisting mainly in (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin (GSE-M). On the other hand, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus bulgaricus strains reached maximal growth with the GSE fractions, including a rich-oligomeric (GSE-O) fraction. Within bifidobacteria, Bifidobacterium lactis BB12 showed the highest sensitivity to the phenolic extracts assayed, whereas Bifidobacterium breve 26M2 and Bifidobacterium bifidum HDD541 reached maximum growth in presence of GSE-O and GSE-M fractions. Metabolism of flavan-3-ols by LAB and bifidobacteria resistant strains was investigated in vitro. The results revealed that only L. plantarum IFPL935 was able to metabolize the polyphenols studied by means of galloyl-esterase, decarboxylase and benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase activities that led to the formation of gallic acid, pyrogallol and catechol, respectively. An unknown metabolite that does not exhibit a phenolic-acid-type structure was also detected, which suggests a new enzyme activity in L. plantarum IFPL935 able to degrade flavan-3-ol monomers.
TI  - The ProPrems trial: investigating the effects of probiotics on late onset sepsis  in very preterm infants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Late onset sepsis is a frequent complication of prematurity associated with increased mortality and morbidity. The commensal bacteria of the gastrointestinal tract play a key role in the development of healthy immune responses. Healthy term infants acquire these commensal organisms rapidly after birth. However, colonisation in preterm infants is adversely affected by delivery mode, antibiotic treatment and the intensive care environment. Altered microbiota composition may lead to increased colonisation with pathogenic bacteria, poor immune development and susceptibility to sepsis in the preterm infant.Probiotics are live microorganisms, which when administered in adequate amounts confer health benefits on the host. Amongst numerous bacteriocidal and nutritional roles, they may also favourably modulate host immune responses in local and remote tissues. Meta-analyses of probiotic supplementation in preterm infants report a reduction in mortality and necrotising enterocolitis. Studies with sepsis as an outcome have reported mixed results to date.Allergic diseases are increasing in incidence in "westernised" countries. There is evidence that probiotics may reduce the incidence of these diseases by altering the intestinal microbiota to influence immune function. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a multi-centre, randomised, double blinded, placebo controlled trial investigating supplementing preterm infants born at < 32 weeks' gestation weighing < 1500 g, with a probiotic combination (Bifidobacterium infantis, Streptococcus thermophilus and Bifidobacterium lactis). A total of 1,100 subjects are being recruited in Australia and New Zealand. Infants commence the allocated intervention from soon after the start of feeds until discharge home or term corrected age. The primary outcome is the incidence of at least one episode of definite (blood culture positive) late onset sepsis before 40 weeks corrected age or discharge home. Secondary outcomes include: Necrotising enterocolitis, mortality, antibiotic usage, time to establish full enteral feeds, duration of hospital stay, growth measurements at 6 and 12 months' corrected age and evidence of atopic conditions at 12 months' corrected age. DISCUSSION: Results from previous studies on the use of probiotics to prevent diseases in preterm infants are promising. However, a large clinical trial is required to address outstanding issues regarding safety and efficacy in this vulnerable population. This study will address these important issues. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Register (ANZCTR): ACTRN012607000144415The product "ABC Dophilus Probiotic Powder for Infants(R)", Solgar, USA has its 3 probiotics strains registered with the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSMZ--German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures) as BB-12 15954, B-02 96579, Th-4 15957.
TI  - The Streptococcus thermophilus CRISPR/Cas system provides immunity in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The CRISPR/Cas adaptive immune system provides resistance against phages and plasmids in Archaea and Bacteria. CRISPR loci integrate short DNA sequences from invading genetic elements that provide small RNA-mediated interference in subsequent exposure to matching nucleic acids. In Streptococcus thermophilus, it was previously shown that the CRISPR1/Cas system can provide adaptive immunity against phages and plasmids by integrating novel spacers following exposure to these foreign genetic elements that subsequently direct the specific cleavage of invasive homologous DNA sequences. Here, we show that the S. thermophilus CRISPR3/Cas system can be transferred into Escherichia coli and provide heterologous protection against plasmid transformation and phage infection. We show that interference is sequence-specific, and that mutations in the vicinity or within the proto-spacer adjacent motif (PAM) allow plasmids to escape CRISPR-encoded immunity. We also establish that cas9 is the sole cas gene necessary for CRISPR-encoded interference. Furthermore, mutation analysis revealed that interference relies on the Cas9 McrA/HNH- and RuvC/RNaseH-motifs. Altogether, our results show that active CRISPR/Cas systems can be transferred across distant genera and provide heterologous interference against invasive nucleic acids. This can be leveraged to develop strains more robust against phage attack, and safer organisms less likely to uptake and disseminate plasmid-encoded undesirable genetic elements.
TI  - Selective and differential enumerations of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei and Bifidobacterium spp. in yoghurt--a review.
AB  - Yoghurt is increasingly being used as a carrier of probiotic bacteria for their potential health benefits. To meet with a recommended level of >/=10(6) viable cells/g of a product, assessment of viability of probiotic bacteria in market preparations is crucial. This requires a working method for selective enumeration of these probiotic bacteria and lactic acid bacteria in yoghurt such as Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lb. acidophilus, Lb. casei and Bifidobacterium. This chapter presents an overview of media that could be used for differential and selective enumerations of yoghurt bacteria. De Man Rogosa Sharpe agar containing fructose (MRSF), MRS agar pH 5.2 (MRS 5.2), reinforced clostridial prussian blue agar at pH 5.0 (RCPB 5.0) or reinforced clostridial agar at pH 5.3 (RCA 5.3) are suitable for enumeration of Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus when the incubation is carried out at 45 degrees C for 72h. S. thermophilus (ST) agar and M17 are recommended for selective enumeration of S. thermophilus. Selective enumeration of Lb. acidophilus in mixed culture could be made in Rogosa agar added with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside (X-Glu) or MRS containing maltose (MRSM) and incubation in a 20% CO2 atmosphere. Lb. casei could be selectively enumerated on specially formulated Lb. casei (LC) agar from products containing yoghurt starter bacteria (S. thermophilus and Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), Lb. acidophilus, Bifidobacterium spp. and Lb. casei. Bifidobacterium could be enumerated on MRS agar supplemented with nalidixic acid, paromomycin, neomycin sulphate and lithium chloride (MRS-NPNL) under anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees C for 72h.
TI  - Peptide-regulated gene depletion system developed for use in Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - To facilitate the study of pneumococcal genes that are essential for viability or normal cell growth, we sought to develop a tightly regulated, titratable gene depletion system that interferes minimally with normal cellular functions. A possible candidate for such a system is the recently discovered signal transduction pathway regulating competence for natural transformation in Streptococcus thermophilus. This pathway, which is unrelated to the ComCDE pathway used for competence regulation in Streptococcus pneumoniae, has not been fully elucidated, but it is known to include a short unmodified signaling peptide, ComS*, an oligopeptide transport system, Ami, and a transcriptional activator, ComR. The transcriptional activator is thought to bind to an inverted repeat sequence termed the ECom box. We introduced the ComR protein and the ECom box into the genome of S. pneumoniae R6 and demonstrated that addition of synthetic ComS* peptide induced the transcription of a luciferase gene inserted downstream of the ECom box. To determine whether the ComRS system could be used for gene depletion studies, the licD1 gene was inserted behind the chromosomally located ECom box promoter by using the Janus cassette. Then, the native versions of licD1 and licD2 were deleted, and the resulting mutant was recovered in the presence of ComS*. Cultivation of the licD1 licD2 double mutant in the absence of ComS* gradually affected its ability to grow and propagate, demonstrating that the ComRS system functions as intended. In the present study, the ComRS system was developed for use in S. pneumoniae. In principle, however, it should work equally well in many other Gram-positive species.
TI  - Some low homogenization pressures improve certain probiotic characteristics of yogurt culture bacteria and Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-K.
AB  - Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus, and Lactobacillus acidophilus are dairy cultures widely used in the manufacture of cultured dairy products. Commonly used homogenization pressures in the dairy industry are 13.80 MPa or less. It is not known whether low homogenization pressures can stimulate bacteria to improve their probiotic characteristics. Objectives were to determine the effect of homogenization at 0, 3.45, 6.90, 10.34, and 13.80 MPa on acid tolerance, bile tolerance, protease activity, and growth of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus LB-12, S. salivarius ssp. thermophilus ST-M5, and L. acidophilus LA-K. The cultures were individually inoculated in cool autoclaved skim milk (4 degrees C) and homogenized for 5 continuous passes. Growth and bile tolerance of samples were determined hourly for 10h of incubation. Acid tolerance was determined every 20 min for 120 min of incubation. Protease activity was determined at 0, 12, and 24h of incubation. All homogenization pressures studied improved acid tolerance of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus LB-12 but had no beneficial effect on protease activity and had negative effects on growth and bile tolerance. A pressure of 6.90 MPa improved acid tolerance, bile tolerance, and protease activity of S. salivarius ssp. thermophilus ST-M5, but none of the homogenization pressures studied had an effect on its growth. Homogenization pressures of 13.80 and 6.90 MPa improved acid tolerance and bile tolerance, respectively, of L. acidophilus LA-K but had no effect on protease activity and its growth. Some low homogenization pressures positively influenced some characteristics of yogurt culture bacteria and L. acidophilus LA-K. Culture pretreatment with some low homogenization pressures can be recommended for improvement of certain probiotic characteristics.
TI  - Characterization of the cysK2-ctl1-cysE2 gene cluster involved in sulfur metabolism in Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - The up- and downstream regions of ctl1 and ctl2 that encode a cystathionine lyase were analyzed in various Lactobacillus casei strains. ctl1 and ctl2 were found to be part of a gene cluster encoding two other open reading frames. One of the two open reading frames precedes ctl1 and encodes a putative cysteine synthase. The other open reading frame lies downstream of ctl1 and encodes a putative serine acetyltransferase. The gene cluster is not present in the publicly available genome sequences of L. casei ATCC 334, BL23 and Zhang. Apparently, the gene cluster was acquired by a horizontal gene transfer event and can also be found in other lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus. RT-PCR was used to analyze the expression of the gene cluster. Additionally, an mass spectrometry-based selected reaction monitoring method was developed for quantifying Ctl1 in a cell-free extract of lactic acid bacteria. The gene cluster cysK2-ctl1-cysE2 was expressed as single transcript, and expression was down-regulated by cysteine. In addition, cystathionine lyase activity present in cell-free extracts disappeared when L. casei was grown in the presence of cysteine. Whereas the transcript and the gene product of ctl1 protein were found in all studied ctl1(+)L. casei strains, only the transcript but not the protein or cystathionine lyase activity was detected in L. helveticus FAM2888, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus ATCC 11842 and S. thermophilus FAM17014, which actually possess a homolog of the cysK2-ctl1-cysE2 gene cluster.
TI  - Bioconversion of ovine scotta into lactic acid with pure and mixed cultures of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Scotta is the main by-product in the making of ricotta cheese. It is widely produced in southern Europe and particularly in Italy where it represents a serious environmental pollutant due to its high lactose content. With the aim of evaluating whether scotta bioconversion into lactic acid can be considered as an alternative to its disposal, besides providing it with an added value, here the growth, fermentative performances, and lactic acid productions of pure and mixed cultures of Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus helveticus, and Streptococcus thermophilus were evaluated on ovine scotta-based media, without and with the addition of nutritional supplements. The outcomes indicate that ovine scotta can be utilized for the biotechnological production of lactic acid with yields up to 92%, comparable to those obtained on cheese-whey. Indeed, the addition of nutritional supplements generally improves the fermentative performances of lactic acid bacteria leading to about 2 g l(-1) h(-1) of lactic acid. Moreover, the use of mixed cultures for scotta bioconversion reduces the need for nutritional supplements, with no detrimental effects on the productive parameters compared to pure cultures. Finally, by using L. casei and S. thermophilus in pure and mixed cultures, up to 99% optically pure L: -lactic acid can be obtained.
TI  - Site-specific accretion of an integrative conjugative element together with a related genomic island leads to cis mobilization and gene capture.
AB  - Genomic islands, flanked by attachment sites, devoid of conjugation and recombination modules and related to the integrative and conjugative element (ICE) ICESt3, were previously found in Streptococcus thermophilus. Here, we show that ICESt3 transfers to a recipient harbouring a similar engineered genomic island, CIMEL(3)catR(3), and integrates by site-specific recombination into its attachment sites, leading to their accretion. The resulting composite island can excise, showing that ICESt3 mobilizes CIMEL(3)catR(3), in cis. ICESt3, CIMEL(3)catR(3), and the whole composite element can transfer from the strain harbouring the composite structure. The ICESt3 transfer to a recipient bearing CIMEL(3)catR(3), can also lead to retromobilization, i.e. its capture by the donor. This is the first demonstration of specific conjugative mobilization of a genomic island in cis and the first report of ICE-mediated retromobilization. CIMEL(3)catR(3), would be the prototype of a novel class of non-autonomous mobile elements (CIMEs: CIs mobilizable elements), which hijack the recombination and conjugation machinery of related ICEs to excise, transfer and integrate. Few genome analyses have shown that CIMEs could be widespread and have revealed internal repeats that could result from accretions in numerous genomic islands, suggesting that accretion and cis mobilization have a key role in evolution of genomic islands.
TI  - Exploring internal features of 16S rRNA gene for identification of clinically relevant species of the genus Streptococcus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus is an economically important genus as a number of species belonging to this genus are human and animal pathogens. The genus has been divided into different groups based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity. The variability observed among the members of these groups is low and it is difficult to distinguish them. The present study was taken up to explore 16S rRNA gene sequence to develop methods that can be used for preliminary identification and can supplement the existing methods for identification of clinically-relevant isolates of the genus Streptococcus. METHODS: 16S rRNA gene sequences belonging to the isolates of S. dysgalactiae, S. equi, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. bovis, S. gallolyticus, S. mutans, S. sobrinus, S. mitis, S. pneumoniae, S. thermophilus and S. anginosus were analyzed with the purpose to define genetic variability within each species to generate a phylogenetic framework, to identify species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. RESULTS: The framework based analysis was used to segregate Streptococcus spp. previously identified upto genus level. This segregation was validated using species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. 43 uncharacterized Streptococcus spp. could be identified using this approach. CONCLUSIONS: The markers generated exploring 16S rRNA gene sequences provided useful tool that can be further used for identification of different species of the genus Streptococcus.
TI  - Short communication: characterization of microflora in Mexican Chihuahua cheese.
AB  - This work was performed to identify the bacterial species present in 10 Chihuahua cheeses obtained from commercial producers in Mexico using 16S rRNA gene analysis. As expected, some of the agar media initially used for isolation were not very selective, supporting the growth of several unrelated bacterial species. Sequence analysis identified potential pathogens, including Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, in all raw milk samples and 2 pasteurized milk samples. Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis were identified in 9 and 6 samples, respectively, and would serve as acidifying agents during cheese production. Lactobacilli were identified in all cheeses, with the most prevalent being Lactobacillus plantarum identified in 7 raw milk and 1 pasteurized milk cheeses. Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Streptococcus macedonicus were identified in 4 raw milk cheeses and both were present in all pasteurized milk samples, suggesting that they may play a role in the development of traditional Chihuahua cheese attributes.
TI  - Diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in Mongolia.
AB  - Spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in Mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. The objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in Mongolia. The LAB counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/mL. Fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of LAB, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. In total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe agar and M17 agar. Each isolate was considered to be presumptive LAB based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, multiplex PCR assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. All isolates from Mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as Enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), Enterococcus durans (3 strains), Lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), Lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), Lactobacillus casei (16 strains), Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), Lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), Lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), Lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), Lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), Lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), Leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), Leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), Streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and Weissella cibaria (1 strain). The predominant LAB were Strep. thermophilus and Lb. helveticus, which were isolated from all sampling sites. The results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of Mongolia have complex compositions of LAB species. Such diversity of LAB provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.
TI  - Effect of functional yogurt NY-YP901 in improving the trait of metabolic syndrome.
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: This study was aimed to assess the beneficial effects on metabolic syndrome of functional yogurt NY-YP901 (Namyang Dairy Product Co. Ltd and Nutra R&BT Inc., Seoul, Korea) supplemented with mixture of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium infantis and extra-ingredients containing Bifidobacterium breve (CBG-C2), Enterococcus faecalis FK-23, fibersol-2 and so on. SUBJECTS/METHODS: This study was designed as an 8-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel study. Treatment and control groups consumed a functional yogurt NY-YP901 (150 ml) and a placebo yogurt twice a day, respectively, for 8 weeks. Body weight and body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, lipid profiles, fasting glucose with HbA1C and waist circumference were measured before and after treatment. Inclusion criteria were healthy individuals between the ages 20-65 years old who submitted an informed consent. RESULTS: During the period August 2009 to December 2009, 101 healthy participants (31 males and 70 females) finished the study. Treatment group were 53 individuals, and the control group were 48 individuals. In the treatment group consuming NY-YP901, statistically significant beneficial changes were observed in body weight (treatment group vs control group=-0.24+/-1.50 vs +0.64+/-1.39 kg, P<0.05), BMI (-0.10+/-0.58 vs +0.24+/-0.50 kg/m(2), P<0.05 ) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (-7.71+/-14.14 vs -0.43+/-15.32 mg/dl, P<0.05) after 8 weeks. The change in other parameters was not different between the treatment and the control groups. CONCLUSIONS: The functional yogurt NY-YP901 reduced LDL-cholesterol, body weight and BMI in the subjects at a 300-ml consumption daily for 8 weeks. From these findings, regular intake of functional yogurt NY-YP901 may be consequently related to improve metabolic syndrome.
TI  - Typing of bacteriophages by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR to assess genetic diversity.
AB  - The recent boom in phage therapy and phage biocontrol requires the design of suitable cocktails of genetically different bacteriophages. The current methods for typing phages need significant quantities of purified DNA, may require a priori genetic information and are cost and time consuming. We have evaluated the randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR technique to produce unique and reproducible band patterns from 26 different bacteriophages infecting Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactococcus lactis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus thermophilus, Bacillus subtilis and Lactobacillus casei bacterial strains. Initially, purified DNA and phage suspensions of seven selected phages were used as a template. The conditions that were found to be optimal 8 muM of 10-mer primers, 3 muM magnesium oxalacetate and 5% dimethyl sulfoxide. The RAPD genomic fingerprints using a phage titer suspension higher than 10(9) PFU mL(-1) were highly reproducible. Clustering by the Pearson correlation coefficient and the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averages clustering algorithm correlated largely with genetically different phages infecting the same bacterial species, although closely related phages with a similar DNA restriction pattern were indistinguishable. The results support the use of RAPD-PCR for quick typing of phage isolates and preliminary assessment of their genetic diversity bypassing tedious DNA purification protocols and previous knowledge of their sequence.
TI  - Production of glutathione using a bifunctional enzyme encoded by gshF from Streptococcus thermophilus expressed in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Glutathione (GSH) is one of the most ubiquitous non-protein thiols that is involved in numerous cellular activities. The gene coding for a novel bifunctional enzyme catalyzing the reaction for glutathione synthesis, gshF, was cloned from Streptococcus thermophilus SIIM B218 and expressed in Escherichia coli JM109. In the presence of the precursor amino acids and ATP, the induced cells of E. coli JM109 (pTrc99A-gshF) could accumulate 10.3 mM GSH in 5 h. The S. thermophilus GshF was insensitive to feedback inhibition caused by GSH even at 20 mM. At elevated concentrations of the precursor amino acids and ATP, E. coli JM109 (pTrc99A-gshF) produced 36 mM GSH with a molar yield of 0.9 mol/mol based on added cysteine and of 0.45 mol/mol based on added ATP. When ATP was replaced with glucose, E. coli JM109 (pTrc99A-gshF) produced 7 mM in 3h. Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used to generate ATP for GSH production. In the presence of glucose and the pmr1 mutant of S. cerevisiae BY4742, JM109 (pTrc99A-gshF) produced 33.9 mM GSH in 12h with a yield of 0.85 mol/mol based on added l-cysteine. It is shown that the S. thermophilus GshF can be successfully used for GSH production.
TI  - Poly(dimethyl siloxane) surface modification with biosurfactants isolated from probiotic strains.
AB  - Depending on the final application envisaged for a given biomaterial, many surfaces must be modified before use. The material performance in a biological environment is mainly mediated by its surface properties that can be improved using suitable modification methods. The aim of this work was to coat poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS) surfaces with biosurfactants (BSs) and to evaluate how these compounds affect the PDMS surface properties. BSs isolated from four probiotic strains (Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus paracasei, Streptococcus thermophilus A, and Streptococcus thermophilus B) were used. Bare PDMS and PDMS coated with BSs were characterized by contact angle measurements, infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The influence of the surface modifications on the materials blood compatibility was studied through thrombosis and hemolysis assays. The cytotoxicity of these materials was tested against rat peritoneal macrophages. AFM results demonstrated the successful coating of the surfaces. Also, by contact angle measurements, an increase of the coated surfaces hydrophilicity was seen. Furthermore, XPS analysis indicated a decrease of the silicon content at the surface, and ATR-FTIR results showed the presence of BS characteristic groups as a consequence of the modification. All the studied materials revealed no toxicity and were found to be nonhemolytic. The proposed approach for the modification of PDMS surfaces was found to be effective and opens new possibilities for the application of these surfaces in the biomedical field.
TI  - The improvement of a phenotype microarray protocol for the chemical sensitivity analysis of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Phenotype MicroArray (PM) permits the characterisation of bacteria under nearly 2000 culture conditions. The PM standard procedure for the chemical sensitivity analysis of Gram-positive bacteria failed in the analysis of Streptococcus thermophilus. Therefore, we developed an efficient and reproducible protocol to obtain a chemically sensitive profile of S. thermophilus using PM.
TI  - Dietary effect of folate-rich fermented milk produced by Streptococcus thermophilus strains on hemoglobin level.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Folate, a water-soluble vitamin, functions as a carbon carrier in the  formation of heme, the iron-containing non-protein portion of hemoglobin. Therefore, its deficiency leads to anemia. The objective of this study was to determine the dietary effects of folate-rich fermented milk produced by high-folate-producing Streptococcus thermophilus strains (RD 102 and RD 104) on hemoglobin level using a murine model. METHODS: Thirty-two albino mice 30 +/- 10 d old were assigned to ingest a basal diet (i.e., a synthetic anemic diet, n = 8, group I, control 1), a basal diet with skim milk (n = 8, group II, control 2), a basal diet with fermented skim milk produced by folate plus RD 102 (n = 8, group III, test 1), and a basal diet with fermented skim milk produced by folate plus RD 104 (n = 8, group IV, test 2) in a 6-wk, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Hemoglobin concentrations were estimated by the Drabkin-Austin cyanmethemoglobin method during the prefeeding (10 d), feeding (20 d), and postfeeding (10 d) trials, respectively. RESULTS: The results showed that the test groups (III and IV) receiving folate-rich fermented milks prepared using high-folate producing S. thermophilus strains showed a significant increase in hemoglobin level compared with the control groups (I and II). CONCLUSION: Folate-rich fermented milks have the potential to significantly increase the hemoglobin level of blood. Hence, high-folate-producing S. thermophilus strains offer a novel natural approach to fortify dairy products with folate.
TI  - Volatile sulphur compounds-forming abilities of lactic acid bacteria: C-S lyase activities.
AB  - Volatile sulphur compounds (VSCs) are of prime importance in the overall aroma of cheese and make a significant contribution to their typical flavours. Thus, the control of VSCs formation offers considerable potential for industrial applications. Here, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from different ecological origins were screened for their abilities to produce VSCs from L-methionine. From the data presented, VSC-forming abilities were shown to be strain-specific and were correlated with the C-S lyase enzymatic activities determined using different approaches. High VSCs formation were detected for those strains that were also shown to possess high thiol-producing abilities (determined either by agar plate or spectrophotometry assays). Moreover, differences in C-S lyase activities were shown to correspond with the enzymatic potential of the strains as determined by in situ gel visualization. Therefore, the assessment of the C-S lyase enzymatic potential, by means of either of these techniques, could be used as a valuable approach for the selection of LAB strains with high VSC-producing abilities thus, representing an effective way to enhance cheese sulphur aroma compounds synthesis. In this regard, this study highlights the flavour forming potential of the Streptococcus thermophilus STY-31, that therefore could be used as a starter culture in cheese manufacture. Furthermore, although C-S lyases are involved in both biosynthetic and catabolic pathways, an association between methionine and cysteine auxotrophy of the selected strains and their VSCs-producing abilities could not be found.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of three novel peptides from casein hydrolysates that stimulate the growth of mixed cultures of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus.
AB  - In this study, sodium caseinate hydrolysates produced by papain with strong growth-stimulating activity for Streptococcus thermophilus (St) and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (Lb) were obtained. A series of separation methods including ultrafiltration, macroporous adsorption resin chromatography, gel filtration chromatography, and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) were applied to isolate and purify the peptide(s), which were mainly responsible for the activity. Finally, three novel growth-stimulating peptides, H-2-A, F2-c, and F2-b, corresponding to amino acid residues 29-35 and 103-108 of bovine alpha(S2)-casein and 181-186 of bovine alpha(S1)-casein, respectively, were obtained. With supplementation of H-2-A, F2-b, or F2-c at a protein concentration of 0.3%, the biomass yield of these two lactic acid bacteria (LAB) was enhanced by 193.3, 166.7, or 151.7%, respectively. In addition, there were significant (p < 0.05) increases in viable counts of St and lactic acid production of LAB in the presence of the purified peptides.
TI  - Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Streptococcus thermophilus induce suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3) gene expression directly and indirectly via interleukin-10 in human primary macrophages.
AB  - In the present study we have characterized T helper type 2 (Th2) [interleukin (IL)-10]/Th1 (IL-12) cytokine expression balance in human primary macrophages stimulated with multiple non-pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria used in the food industry and as probiotic substances. Bacteria representing Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, Propionibacterium and Streptococcus species induced anti-inflammatory IL-10 production, although quantitative differences between the bacteria were observed. S. thermophilus was able to induce IL-12 production, while the production of IL-12 induced by other bacteria remained at a low level. The highest anti-inflammatory potential was seen with bifidobacteria, as evidenced by high IL-10/IL-12 induction ratios. All studied non-pathogenic bacteria were able to stimulate the expression of suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS) 3 that controls the expression of proinflammatory cytokine genes. Lactobacillus and Streptococcus species induced SOCS3 mRNA expression directly in the absence of protein synthesis and indirectly via bacteria-induced IL-10 production, as demonstrated by experiments with cycloheximide (CHX) and anti-IL-10 antibodies, respectively. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 signalling pathway played a key role in bacteria-induced SOCS3 gene expression. Enhanced IL-10 production and SOCS3 gene expression induced by live non-pathogenic Lactobacillus and Streptococcus is also likely to contribute to their immunoregulatory effects in vivo.
TI  - Effect of partial substitution of NaCl with KCl on proteolysis of halloumi cheese.
AB  - The effect of substitution of NaCl with Potassium chloride (KCl) in brine solution on proteolysis of halloumi cheese was investigated. Halloumi cheeses were made and kept in 4 different brine solutions (18% w/w), including only NaCl (HA; control); 3NaCl:1KCl (w/w) (HB); 1NaCl:1KCl (w/w) (HC); 1NaCl:3KCl (w/w) (HD); and stored for 56 d at 4 degrees C. Proteolysis was assessed using water-soluble nitrogen (WSN), trichloroacetic acid-soluble nitrogen (TCA-SN), phosphotungstic-soluble nitrogen (PTA-SN), urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (urea-PAGE), and peptide patterns. WSN and TCA-SN contents were similar in all experimental cheeses. Peptide patterns of the pH 4.6 N fraction and urea-PAGE showed no significant difference between halloumi cheeses kept in various NaCl/KCl mixtures (HB, HC, HD) and control (HA). Sodium and potassium contents showed positive correlations with WSN and PTA-SN. There was an inverse correlation between calcium (Ca) contents and WSN and PTA-SN. Correlations between Ca and Na or K were negative at the same salt treatment.
TI  - Use of gases to improve survival of Bifidobacterium bifidum by modifying redox potential in fermented milk.
AB  - The aim of this work was to study the effect of the oxidoreduction potential, modified using gas, on the growth and survival of a probiotic strain, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and 2 yogurt strains, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus. Three fermented milks were manufactured with an initial oxidoreduction potential value adjusted to +440 mV (control milk), +350 mV (milk gassed with N(2)), and -300 mV [milk gassed with N(2) plus 4% (vol/vol) H(2) (N(2)-H(2))]. Acidification profiles, growth during milk fermentation and survival during storage at 4 degrees C for 28 d were determined. This study showed that fermented probiotic dairy products made from milk gassed with N(2) and, more particularly, those made from milk gassed with N(2)H(2) were characterized by a significant increase in B. bifidum survival during storage without affecting the fermentation kinetics and the survival of Strep. thermophilus and L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus.
TI  - Oral ingestion of Streptococcus thermophilus does not affect mucositis severity or tumor progression in the tumor-bearing rat.
AB  - Preventative or adjunctive agents for the amelioration of small intestinal chemotherapy-induced mucositis are not currently available for clinical use. We have previously demonstrated that oral ingestion of Streptococcus thermophilus (TH-4) partially attenuated chemotherapy-induced mucositis in the rat. Here we assess the effects of TH-4 on small intestinal damage and tumor progression in tumor-bearing rats with experimentally-induced mucositis. Female Dark Agouti tumor-bearing (mammary adenocarcinoma) rats (n = 36; 139 +/- 1 g) had small intestinal damage induced via the administration of methotrexate (MTX). Rats were administered MTX; (1.5 mg/kg intramuscular) or saline at 0 and 24 h; with daily gavage administration of TH-4 (109 cfu/mL) or skim milk from -48 to +96 h post-MTX. Rats were allocated to groups (n=9): saline control, TH-4 control, MTX control or TH-4+MTX. The non-invasive ( 13) C-sucrose breath test (SBT) was conducted prior to tumor inoculation, pre-MTX (-24 h) and prior to sacrifice (96 h) to monitor gut function. At sacrifice small intestinal segments were excised and assessed for sucrase and myeloperoxidase activity as well as histological damage. Irrespective of TH-4 treatment, MTX-treated rats had a significant decrease in bodyweight, SBT levels, sucrase and myeloperoxidase activity, and histological damage score (p < 0.05) compared to saline and TH-4 control rats. TH-4 treatment did not result in tumor progression (p > 0.05) but failed to alleviate mucositis indices. Although TH-4, at a dose of 109 cfu/mL, yielded neither protection nor amelioration of chemotherapy-induced mucositis, progression of mammary adenocarcinoma was unaffected.
TI  - Probiotic Fermented Milk Containing Dietary Fiber Has Additive Effects in IBS with Constipation Compared to Plain Probiotic Fermented Milk.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Although controversial, probiotics and dietary fiber are commonly used for patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We evaluated the effects of multistrain probiotics on the symptoms of IBS to determine whether the addition of dietary fi ber had an additive effect on constipation-predominant IBS. METHODS: A total of 142 participants who met the Rome III criteria were recruited and randomized into a control group or a test group. Participants in the control group received multistrain probiotic fermented milk with Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium infantis; the participants in the test group received the same probiotic fermented milk mixed with dietary fi ber such as sea tangle extracts, radish extracts and glasswort extracts. The patients were treated for four weeks. RESULTS: Most of the symptoms of IBS, with the exception of fl atulence, stool consistency, and frequency of defecation, signifi cantly improved in both groups. In the analysis of IBS subtypes, especially constipation-predominant IBS, the frequency and duration of defecation and straining at stool were improved more in the test group than in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary fiber had additive benefits for the symptoms of constipation, especially in constipation-predominant IBS.
TI  - Lateral gene transfer of streptococcal ICE element RD2 (region of difference 2) encoding secreted proteins.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The genome of serotype M28 group A Streptococcus (GAS) strain MGAS6180 contains a novel genetic element named Region of Difference 2 (RD2) that encodes seven putative secreted extracellular proteins. RD2 is present in all serotype M28 strains and strains of several other GAS serotypes associated with female urogenital infections. We show here that the GAS RD2 element is present in strain MGAS6180 both as an integrative chromosomal form and a circular extrachromosomal element. RD2-like regions were identified in publicly available genome sequences of strains representing three of the five major group B streptococcal serotypes causing human disease. Ten RD2-encoded proteins have significant similarity to proteins involved in conjugative transfer of Streptococcus thermophilus integrative chromosomal elements (ICEs). RESULTS: We transferred RD2 from GAS strain MGAS6180 (serotype M28) to serotype M1 and M4 GAS strains by filter mating. The copy number of the RD2 element was rapidly and significantly increased following treatment of strain MGAS6180 with mitomycin C, a DNA damaging agent. Using a PCR-based method, we also identified RD2-like regions in multiple group C and G strains of Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp.equisimilis cultured from invasive human infections. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the data indicate that the RD2 element has disseminated by lateral gene transfer to genetically diverse strains of human-pathogenic streptococci.
TI  - ClpC acts as a negative regulator of competence in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The alternative sigma factor ComX is a key regulator of natural transformation in members of the genus Streptococcus. ComX controls expression of the late competence genes, which are essential for DNA binding, uptake and recombination. In Streptococcus pneumoniae, it has been demonstrated that ComX is degraded by ClpEP at the end of the competence period. In the present study we show that a different Clp protease complex, ClpCP, contributes to ComX degradation in Streptococcus thermophilus. Mutant strains lacking the ClpC chaperone displayed significantly increased transformability compared with the wild-type strain under conditions where ComX was expressed at relatively low levels. At higher expression levels, ClpCP appears to become saturated and unable to prevent the accumulation of ComX. Together, our results suggest that the role of ClpC is to mediate degradation of ComX when the sigma factor is produced in low amounts, i.e. when the environmental stimulus promoting competence development is weak. This would prevent S. thermophilus from developing the competent state at an inappropriate time and/or place.
TI  - Rgg proteins associated with internalized small hydrophobic peptides: a new quorum-sensing mechanism in streptococci.
AB  - We identified a genetic context encoding a transcriptional regulator of the Rgg family and a small hydrophobic peptide (SHP) in nearly all streptococci and suggested that it may be involved in a new quorum-sensing mechanism, with SHP playing the role of a pheromone. Here, we provide further support for this hypothesis by constructing a phylogenetic tree of the Rgg and Rgg-like proteins from Gram-positive bacteria and by studying the shp/rgg1358 locus of Streptococcus thermophilus LMD-9. We identified the shp1358 gene as a target of Rgg1358, and used it to confirm the existence of the steps of a quorum-sensing mechanism including secretion, maturation and reimportation of the pheromone into the cell. We used surface plasmon resonance to demonstrate interaction between the pheromone and the regulatory protein and performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays to assess binding of the transcriptional regulator to the promoter regions of its target genes. The active form of the pheromone was identified by mass spectrometry. Our findings demonstrate that the shp/rgg1358 locus encodes two components of a novel quorum-sensing mechanism involving a transcriptional regulator of the Rgg family and a SHP pheromone that is detected and reimported into the cell by the Ami oligopeptide transporter.
TI  - A fermented formula in pre-term infants: clinical tolerance, gut microbiota, down-regulation of faecal calprotectin and up-regulation of faecal secretory IgA.
AB  - Intestinal bacterial colonisation in pre-term infants is delayed compared with full-term infants, leading to an increased risk of gastrointestinal disease. Modulation of colonisation through dietary supplementation with probiotics or prebiotics could decrease such a risk. The present study evaluated clinical tolerance, the effects on gut microbiota, and inflammatory and immunological mucosal responses to an infant formula adapted for pre-term infants that included in its manufacturing process a fermentation step with two probiotic strains, Bifidobacterium breve C50 and Streptococcus thermophilus 065, inactivated by heat at the end of the process. A total of fifty-eight infants (gestational age: 30-35 weeks), fed either the fermented pre-term formula or a standard pre-term formula, were followed up during their hospital stay. Clinical tolerance, faecal microbiota using a culture and a culture-independent method (temporal temperature gel electrophoresis), faecal calprotectin and secretory IgA were analysed weekly. No difference was observed regarding anthropometric data and digestive tolerance, except for abdominal distension, the incidence of which was lower in infants fed the fermented formula for 2 weeks. Bacterial colonisation was not modified by the type of feeding, particularly for bifidobacteria. Faecal calprotectin was significantly lower in infants fed the fermented formula for 2 weeks, and secretory IgA increased with both mother's milk and the fermented formula. The fermented formula was well tolerated and did not significantly modulate the bacterial colonisation but had benefits on inflammatory and immune markers, which might be related to some features of gastrointestinal tolerance.
TI  - Coexpression of the superoxide dismutase and the catalase provides remarkable oxidative stress resistance in Lactobacillus rhamnosus.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are generally sensitive to oxidative stress caused by  reactive oxygen species (ROS). Antioxidant enzymes, especially superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), can protect against ROS by eliminating superoxide and H(2)O(2), respectively. Lactobacillus rhamnosus is a valuable probiotic starter culture but is deficient in both SOD and CAT, and is thus likely to suffer from oxidative stress in industrial fermentation. To confer high level of oxidative resistance on L. rhamnosus , the SOD gene sodA from Streptococcus thermophilus and CAT gene katA from L. sakei were coexpressed in L. rhamnosus AS 1.2466. The enzyme activities of SOD and CAT were 147.80 +/- 1.08 U/mg protein and 2.53 mumol of H(2)O(2) /min/10(8) cfu, respectively, in the recombinant L. rhamnosus CS. After incubation with 10 mM H(2)O(2), the survival ratio of L. rhamnosus CS was 400-fold higher than that of L. rhamnosus CAT. In long-term aerated conditions, viable cells of L. rhamnosus CS remained approximately 10(6) cfu/mL after incubation for 7 days, while no living cells of the control were detected. These results showed that the cooperation between SOD and CAT could significantly enhance oxidative resistance in L. rhamnosus . To our best knowledge, this is the first report of two synergistic antioxidant genes being coexpressed in the same Lactobacilli.
TI  - Quantitative analysis of histidine decarboxylase gene (hdcA) transcription and histamine production by Streptococcus thermophilus PRI60 under conditions relevant to cheese making.
AB  - This study evaluated the influence of parameters relevant for cheese making on histamine formation by Streptococcus thermophilus. Strains possessing a histidine decarboxylase (hdcA) gene represented 6% of the dairy isolates screened. The most histaminogenic, S. thermophilus PRI60, exhibited in skim milk a high basal level of expression of hdcA, upregulation in the presence of free histidine and salt, and repression after thermization. HdcA activity persisted in cell extracts, indicating that histamine might accumulate after cell lysis in cheese.
TI  - Development of a pentaplex PCR assay for the simultaneous detection of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, L. helveticus, L. fermentum in whey starter for Grana Padano cheese.
AB  - A pentaplex PCR assay for the rapid, selective and simultaneous detection of Lactobacillus helveticus, L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, and L. fermentum, was developed. The target sequences were a group of genes coding for beta-galactosidase production (S. thermophilus and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), for cell-enveloped associated proteinase synthesis (L. helveticus), for dipeptide transport system production (L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis) and for arginine-ornithine antiporter protein production (L. fermentum). The analytical specificity of the assay was evaluated with 5 reference strains and 140 lactic acid bacterial strains derived from raw milk cheeses and belonging to the Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Lactococcus and Enterococcus genera. The identification limit for each target strain was 10(3)CFU/ml. This new molecular assay was used to investigate the LAB population by direct extraction of DNA from the 12 whey cultures for Grana Padano. The pentaplex PCR assay revealed a good correspondence with microbiological analyses and allowed to identify even minor LAB community members which, can be out-competed in vitro by numerically more abundant microbial species.
TI  - Hyaluronic acid production by recombinant Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Generally recognized as safe, Streptococcus thermophilus was transformed using a  plasmid expressing endogenous hyaluronic acid (HA) synthase genes. A single expression of hyaluronic acid synthase (hasA), uridine diphosphate-glucose dehydrogenase gene (hasB), or pyrophosphorylase gene (glmU) and double expression of hasA and hasB were attempted. A streptococcus-Escherichia coli shuttle vector, pBE31, was successfully transfected in S. thermophilus. The single expression of hasA or hasB allowed S. thermophilus to produce about 0.5-1.0 g/l HA. The strains coexpressing of hasA and hasB showed a markedly increased HA production (1.2g/l) which was six-fold increase compared with the wild-type strain. The maximum cell concentration and specific growth rate of each recombinant strain were lower than those of the wild-type strain; however, the specific production rate was more than 100-fold higher. Galactose concentration decreased in the coexpressing strain after depletion of lactose. The bacterial metabolism would be altered in order to achieve a higher production by changing the intracellular metabolism. The average molecular weight of HA (1.0 x 10(6) Da) was not affected by the expression of hasA and hasB. HA produced from recombinant strain could be an alternative material for medical, cosmetic and food utilization instead of HA from conventional pathogenic streptococci.
TI  - Cas3 is a single-stranded DNA nuclease and ATP-dependent helicase in the CRISPR/Cas immune system.
AB  - Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) is a recently discovered adaptive prokaryotic immune system that provides acquired immunity against foreign nucleic acids by utilizing small guide crRNAs (CRISPR RNAs) to interfere with invading viruses and plasmids. In Escherichia coli, Cas3 is essential for crRNA-guided interference with virus proliferation. Cas3 contains N-terminal HD phosphohydrolase and C-terminal Superfamily 2 (SF2) helicase domains. Here, we provide the first report of the cloning, expression, purification and in vitro functional analysis of the Cas3 protein of the Streptococcus thermophilus CRISPR4 (Ecoli subtype) system. Cas3 possesses a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-stimulated ATPase activity, which is coupled to unwinding of DNA/DNA and RNA/DNA duplexes. Cas3 also shows ATP-independent nuclease activity located in the HD domain with a preference for ssDNA substrates. To dissect the contribution of individual domains, Cas3 separation-of-function mutants (ATPase(+)/nuclease(-) and ATPase(-)/nuclease(+)) were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis. We propose that the Cas3 ATPase/helicase domain acts as a motor protein, which assists delivery of the nuclease activity to Cascade-crRNA complex targeting foreign DNA.
TI  - Impact of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 and, Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5-containing yoghurt, on fecal bacterial counts of healthy adults.
AB  - This randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind, parallel dose-response study investigated the impact of 4-week commercial yoghurt consumption supplemented with Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (BB-12) and Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA-5) on fecal bacterial counts of healthy adults. Fifty-eight volunteers were randomly assigned to three different groups: 1. placebo (no probiotic, no starter and no green tea extract); 2. Yoptimal (10(9)cfu/100g of BB-12 and LA-5 and 40mg of green tea extract) and 3. Yoptimal-10 (10(10)cfu/100g of BB-12, 10(9)cfu/100g of LA-5 and 40mg of green tea extract). These yoghurt products also contained Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (10(7)cfu/100g) and Streptococcus thermophilus (10(10)cfu/100g). The quantitative PCR (qPCR) results showed that there were significant increases (P=0.02) in bifidobacteria counts with the Yoptimal treatment as compared to baseline. The fecal numbers of B. animalis subsp. lactis and LA-5 significantly increased in the two probiotic treatments compared to the placebo treatment. Viable counts of fecal lactobacilli were significantly higher (P=0.05) and those of enterococci were significantly lower (P=0.04) after the intervention when compared to placebo. No significant difference was observed between treatments in volunteers' weight, waist girth, blood pressure, fasting plasma triglyceride and HDL-C concentrations, as well as cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio. However, a significant increase in plasma cholesterol levels was observed in the placebo group (P=0.0018) but the levels remained stable in the two probiotic yoghurt groups. These results show that probiotic strains supplemented in the form of yoghurt remain active during gut transit and are associated with an increase in beneficial bacteria and a reduction in potentially pathogenic bacteria. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00730626.
TI  - The first C-glycosidic analogue of a novel galactosyltransferase inhibitor.
AB  - Structural analogues and mimics of the natural sugar-nucleotide UDP-galactose (UDP-Gal) are sought after as chemical tools for glycobiology and drug discovery. We have recently developed a novel class of galactosyltransferase (GalT) inhibitors derived from UDP-Gal, bearing an additional substituent at the 5-position of the uracil base. Herein we report the first C-glycosidic derivative of this new class of GalT inhibitors. We describe a practical convergent synthesis of the new UDP-C-Gal derivative, including a systematic study into the use of radical chemistry for the preparation of galactosyl ethylphosphonate, a key synthetic intermediate. The new inhibitor showed activity against a bacterial UDP-Gal 4'-epimerase at micromolar concentrations. This is the first example of a base-modified UDP-sugar as an inhibitor of a UDP-sugar-dependent enzyme which is not a glycosyltransferase, and these results may therefore have implications for the design of inhibitors of these enzymes in the future.
TI  - Complete sequencing and pan-genomic analysis of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp.  bulgaricus reveal its genetic basis for industrial yogurt production.
AB  - Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (Lb. bulgaricus) is an important species of Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) used for cheese and yogurt fermentation. The genome of Lb. bulgaricus 2038, an industrial strain mainly used for yogurt production, was completely sequenced and compared against the other two ATCC collection strains of the same subspecies. Specific physiological properties of strain 2038, such as lysine biosynthesis, formate production, aspartate-related carbon-skeleton intermediate metabolism, unique EPS synthesis and efficient DNA restriction/modification systems, are all different from those of the collection strains that might benefit the industrial production of yogurt. Other common features shared by Lb. bulgaricus strains, such as efficient protocooperation with Streptococcus thermophilus and lactate production as well as well-equipped stress tolerance mechanisms may account for it being selected originally for yogurt fermentation industry. Multiple lines of evidence suggested that Lb. bulgaricus 2038 was genetically closer to the common ancestor of the subspecies than the other two sequenced collection strains, probably due to a strict industrial maintenance process for strain 2038 that might have halted its genome decay and sustained a gene network suitable for large scale yogurt production.
TI  - Comparison of culture-dependent and -independent methods for bacterial community  monitoring during Montasio cheese manufacturing.
AB  - The microbial community in milk is of great importance in the manufacture of traditional cheeses produced using raw milk and natural cultures. During milk curdling and cheese ripening, complex interactions occur in the microbial community, and accurate identification of the microorganisms involved provides essential information for understanding their role in these processes and in flavor production. Recent improvements in molecular biological methods have led to their application to food matrices, and thereby opened new perspectives for the study of microbial communities in fermented foods. In this study, a description of microbial community composition during the manufacture and ripening of Montasio cheese was provided. A combined approach using culture-dependent and -independent methods was applied. Culture-dependent identification was compared with 16S clone libraries sequencing data obtained from both DNA and reverse-transcribed RNA (cDNA) amplification and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays developed to detect and quantify specific bacterial species/genera (Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Enterococcus spp., Pseudomonas spp.). S. thermophilus was the predominant LAB species throughout the entire ripening period of Montasio cheese. The culture-independent method demonstrates the relevant presence of Pseudomonas spp. and Lactococcus piscium at the beginning of ripening. The culture-dependent approach and the two culture-independent approaches produced complementary information, together generating a general view of cheese microbial ecology.
TI  - Effect of oxidoreduction potential on aroma biosynthesis by lactic acid bacteria  in nonfat yogurt.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of oxidoreduction potential (Eh) on the biosynthesis of aroma compounds by lactic acid bacteria in non-fat yogurt. The study was done with yogurts fermented by Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus. The Eh was modified by the application of different gaseous conditions (air, nitrogen, and nitrogen/hydrogen). Acetaldehyde, dimethyl sulfide, diacetyl, and pentane-2,3-dione, as the major endogenous odorant compounds of yogurt, were chosen as tracers for the biosynthesis of aroma compounds by lactic acid bacteria. Oxidative conditions favored the production of acetaldehyde, dimethyl sulfide, and diketones (diacetyl and pentane-2,3-dione). The Eh of the medium influences aroma production in yogurt by modifying the metabolic pathways of Lb. bulgaricus and Strep. thermophilus. The use of Eh as a control parameter during yogurt production could permit the control of aroma formation.
TI  - Beneficial effects of a synbiotic supplement on self-perceived gastrointestinal well-being and immunoinflammatory status of healthy adults.
AB  - The use of synbiotics as health promoters is still poorly defined, and human intervention studies are scarce. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of a commercialized synbiotic product containing Lactobacillus acidophilus La5, Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis Bb-12, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei, Streptococcus thermophilus, and fructooligosaccharides on the self-reported gastrointestinal well-being and the immunoinflammatory status of healthy human subjects. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 20 women and 16 men (25-45 years old) received either three tablets per day of the synbiotic product (2.4 x 10(9) colony-forming units/day) or placebo during 6 weeks. Gastrointestinal symptoms and bowel habits were evaluated through a self-administered questionnaire. In those subjects suffering from any kind of digestive disturbance (mild dyspepsia, flatulence, postprandial bloating, constipation, etc.), improvements in symptoms after product consumption were also evaluated. Blood lymphocyte subsets, phagocytic activity, serum C-reactive protein, ceruloplasmin, and adhesion molecules concentrations were analyzed prior and after treatment. A significant improvement in overall self-reported gastrointestinal symptoms and bowel habit was found in the synbiotic group. A marginal effect of treatment (analysis of variance P = .050) was observed with L-selectin, which showed a significant decrease in the synbiotic group (P = .019). In addition, basal L-selectin levels correlated with final intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 levels (r = 0.468; P = .050), and basal ICAM-1 levels tended to correlate negatively with final L-selectin concentration (r = -0.457; P = .056). None of these correlations was found in the placebo group. The rest of the immunological parameters studied were not modified by the intervention. In conclusion, consumption of the synbiotic product improves self-perceived bowel habits and might facilitate a better profile of adhesion molecules in healthy adults.
TI  - Impact of the metabolic activity of Streptococcus thermophilus on the colon epithelium of gnotobiotic rats.
AB  - The thermophilic lactic acid bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus is widely and traditionally used in the dairy industry. Despite the vast level of consumption of S. thermophilus through yogurt or probiotic functional food, very few data are available about its physiology in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). The objective of the present work was to explore both the metabolic activity and host response of S. thermophilus in vivo. Our study profiles the protein expression of S. thermophilus after its adaptation to the GIT of gnotobiotic rats and describes the impact of S. thermophilus colonization on the colonic epithelium. S. thermophilus colonized progressively the GIT of germ-free rats to reach a stable population in 30 days (10(8) cfu/g of feces). This progressive colonization suggested that S. thermophilus undergoes an adaptation process within GIT. Indeed, we showed that the main response of S. thermophilus in the rat's GIT was the massive induction of the glycolysis pathway, leading to formation of lactate in the cecum. At the level of the colonic epithelium, the abundance of monocarboxylic acid transporter mRNAs (SLC16A1 and SLC5A8) and a protein involved in the cell cycle arrest (p27(kip1)) increased in the presence of S. thermophilus compared with germ-free rats. Based on different mono-associated rats harboring two different strains of S. thermophilus (LMD-9 or LMG18311) or weak lactate-producing commensal bacteria (Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Ruminococcus gnavus), we propose that lactate could be a signal produced by S. thermophilus and modulating the colon epithelium.
TI  - In silico prediction of horizontal gene transfer in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - A combination of gene loss and acquisition through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is thought to drive Streptococcus thermophilus adaptation to its niche, i.e. milk. In this study, we describe an in silico analysis combining a stochastic data mining method, analysis of homologous gene distribution and the identification of features frequently associated with horizontally transferred genes to assess the proportion of the S. thermophilus genome that could originate from HGT. Our mining approach pointed out that about 17.7% of S. thermophilus genes (362 CDSs of 1,915) showed a composition bias; these genes were called 'atypical'. For 22% of them, their functional annotation strongly support their acquisition through HGT and consisted mainly in genes encoding mobile genetic recombinases, exopolysaccharide (EPS) biosynthesis enzymes or resistance mechanisms to bacteriophages. The distribution of the atypical genes in the Firmicutes phylum as well as in S. thermophilus species was sporadic and supported the HGT prediction for more than a half (52%, 189). Among them, 46 were found specific to S. thermophilus. Finally, by combining our method, gene annotation and sequence specific features, new genome islands were suggested in the S. thermophilus genome.
TI  - Characterization and transfer of antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria from fermented food products.
AB  - The study provides phenotypic and molecular analyses of the antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from fermented foods in Xi'an, China. LAB strains (n = 84) belonging to 16 species of Lactobacillus (n = 73), and Streptococcus thermophilus (n = 11) were isolated and identified by sequencing their 16S rRNA gene. All strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, and cefsulodin, and intrinsically resistant to nalidixic acid, kanamycin, and vancomycin (except L. bulgaricus, L. acidophilus, and S. thermophilus, which were susceptible to vancomycin). Some strains had acquired resistance for penicillin (n = 2), erythromycin (n = 9), clindamycin (n = 5), and tetracycline (n = 14), while resistance to gentamycin, ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, and chloramphenicol was species dependent. Minimum inhibitory concentrations presented in this study will help to review microbiological breakpoints for some of the species of Lactobacillus. The erm(B) gene was detected from two strains of each of L. fermentum and L. vaginalis, and one strain of each of L. plantarum, L. salivarius, L. acidophilus, L. animalis, and S. thermophilus. The tet genes were identified from 12 strains of lactobacilli from traditional foods. This is the first time, the authors identified tet(S) gene from L. brevis and L. kefiri. The erm(B) gene from L. fermentum NWL24 and L. salivarius NWL33, and tet(M) gene from L. plantarum NWL22 and L. brevis NWL59 were successfully transferred to Enterococcus faecalis 181 by filter mating. It was concluded that acquired antibiotic resistance is well dispersed in fermented food products in Xi'an, China and its transferability to other genera should be monitored closely.
TI  - HdcB, a novel enzyme catalysing maturation of pyruvoyl-dependent histidine decarboxylase.
AB  - Pyruvoyl-dependent histidine decarboxylases are produced as proenzymes that mature by cleavage followed by formation of the pyruvoyl prosthetic group. The histidine decarboxylation pathway of Streptococcus thermophilus CHCC1524 that consists of the pyruvoyl-dependent histidine decarboxylase HdcA and the histidine/histamine exchanger HdcP was functionally expressed in Lactococcus lactis. The operon encoding the pathway contains in addition to the hdcA and hdcP genes a third gene hdcB. Expression of different combinations of the genes in L. lactis and Escherichia coli followed by analysis of the protein products demonstrated the involvement of HdcB in the cleavage of the HdcA proenzyme. The HdcA proenzyme and HdcB protein were purified to homogeneity and cleavage and activation of the histidine decarboxylase activity was demonstrated in vitro. Substoichiometric amounts of HdcB were required to cleave HdcA showing that HdcB functions as an enzyme. In agreement, expression levels of HdcB in the cells were low relative to those of HdcA. The turnover number of HdcB in vitro was extremely low (0.05 min(-)(1)) which was due to a very slow association/dissociation of the enzyme/substrate complex. In fact, HdcB was shown to co-purify both with the HdcA S82A mutant that mimics the proenzyme and with the mature HdcA complex.
TI  - Protein-protein interactions among the components of the biosynthetic machinery responsible for exopolysaccharide production in Streptococcus thermophilus MR-1C.
AB  - AIM: This study identified protein-protein interactions among the biosynthetic machinery responsible for exopolysaccharide (EPS) production in Streptococcus thermophilus MR-1C. METHODS AND RESULTS: Protein-protein interactions were investigated using the yeast two-hybrid system. A strong protein-protein interaction was detected between the transmembrane activation protein Wzd and the protein tyrosine kinase Wze. Weaker protein-protein interactions were detected between two duplicate Wze proteins and between Wze and the phosphotyrosine phosphatase Wzh. Protein-protein interactions involving a Wzd/Wze fusion protein and Wzd and Wze may indicate that these proteins form multi-protein complexes. All combinations of the Wzh, Wzd, Wze, Wzg (regulation), CpsE (glycosyl-1-phosphate transferase), CpsS (polymerization), CpsL (unknown), CpsW (regulation) and CpsU (membrane translocation) were analysed for protein-protein interactions but no additional interactions were discovered using the yeast two-hybrid system. CONCLUSIONS: Interactions among the phosphotyrosine phosphatase, tyrosine kinase, and transmembrane activation protein are important in the regulation of capsule biosynthesis in Strep. thermophilus MR-1C. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study provides some valuable insight into the organization and interactions between the many proteins involved in EPS production. A better understanding of this process may facilitate the genetic manipulation of capsule production to impart desirable properties to dairy starter cultures.
TI  - Effects of yogurt starter cultures on the survival of Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Recognized to confer health benefits to consumers, probiotics such as Lactobacillus acidophilus are commonly incorporated into fermented dairy products worldwide; among which yogurt is a popular delivery vehicle. To materialize most of the putative health benefits associated with probiotics, an adequate amount of viable cells must be delivered at the time of consumption. However, the loss in their viabilities during refrigerated storage has been demonstrated previously. This study focused on the effects of yogurt starter cultures on the survival of five strains of L. acidophilus, with emphases on low pH and acid production. Differential survival behavior between L. acidophilus strains was further analyzed. To this end, viable cell counts of L. acidophilus were determined weekly during 4 degrees C storage in various types of yogurts made with Streptococcus thermophilus alone, L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus alone, both species of the starter cultures, or glucono-delta-lactone (GDL). All yogurt types, except for pasteurized yogurts, were co-fermented with L. acidophilus. Yogurt filtrate was analyzed for the presence of any inhibitory substance and for the amount of hydrogen peroxide. Multiplication of L. acidophilus was not affected by the starter cultures as all strains reached high level on day 0 of the storage period. Throughout the 28-day storage period, cell counts of L. acidophilus PIM703 and SBT2062 remained steady (~6 x 10(7)CFU/g) in yogurts made with both starter cultures, whereas those of ATCC 700396 and NCFM were reduced by a maximum of 3 and 4.6 logs, respectively. When starter cultures were replaced by GDL, all strains survived well, suggesting that a low pH was not a critical factor dictating their survival. In addition, the filtrate collected from yogurts made with starter cultures appeared to have higher inhibitory activities against L. acidophilus than that made with GDL. The presence of viable starter cultures was necessary to adversely affect the survival of some strains, as pasteurized yogurts had no effect on their survival. In particular, the inhibitory effect exerted by L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus on L. acidophilus NCFM was highly pronounced than by S. thermophilus, nevertheless, the same effect was not observed on SBT2062. The inhibition against stationary-phase NCFM cells might be caused by the elevated level of hydrogen peroxide produced by L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus. Delineating factors driving the differences in survival trait among probiotic strains will lead to a more efficacious delivery of health benefits in fermented dairy products through targeted technological interventions.
TI  - Gene cluster for biosynthesis of thermophilin 1277--a lantibiotic produced by Streptococcus thermophilus SBT1277, and heterologous expression of TepI, a novel immunity peptide.
AB  - AIMS: To identify genes cluster for thermophilin 1277 produced by Streptococcus thermophilus SBT1277. METHODS AND RESULTS: To identify genes for thermophilin 1277 production, the chromosomal DNA region surrounding the structural gene, tepA, was sequenced using a primer-walking method. The thermophilin 1277 biosynthesis gene locus (tep) is a 9.9-kb region, which consists of at least ten open reading frames (ORFs) in the following order: tepAMTFEGKRI and ORF4. Homology analysis showed high similarity to genes involved in bovicin HJ50 production by Streptococcus bovis HJ50. tepI encodes a novel, small, positively charged hydrophobic peptide of 52 amino acids, which contains a putative transmembrane segment. By heterologous expression in Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris MG1363, the TepI-expressing strain exhibited at least 1.3 times higher resistance to thermophilin 1277. CONCLUSIONS: Thermophilin 1277 biosynthesis genes were encoded by a 9.9-kbp region containing at least ten ORFs. TepI is a novel immunity peptide, which protected Strep. thermophilus SBT1277 against thermophilin 1277 in addition to TepFEG, a putative ABC transporter. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first report regarding a lantibiotic gene cluster produced by Strep. thermophilus strain.
TI  - The incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis is increased following probiotic administration to preterm pigs.
AB  - Preterm birth and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is associated with inappropriate gut colonization and immunity, which may be improved by probiotic bacteria. Using a preterm pig model of NEC, we investigated the effects of probiotics on intestinal structure, function, microbiology, and immunology in the immediate postnatal period. Just after birth, caesarean-delivered preterm pigs were inoculated with Lactobacillus paracasei, Bifidobacteria animalis, and Streptococcus thermophilus (total 2.4 x 10(10)/d) either as live (ProLive, n = 14) or gamma-irradiated dead bacteria (ProDead, n = 12) and compared with controls (n = 14). All pigs received parenteral nutrition for 2 d followed by enteral formula feeding until tissue collection on d 5. Compared with control pigs, intestinal weight was lower and NEC incidence was higher in both groups given probiotics (64-67 vs. 14%; P<0.01). Hexose absorption, brush border enzyme activities, and gut barrier function were lower in the ProDead group compared with the other groups (P < 0.05), whereas live probiotics induced higher expression of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1alpha and IL-6 (P < 0.05). Probiotics minimally affected gut colonization, except that live probiotics induced a higher density of B. animalis and lower bacterial diversity in the distal intestinal mucosa and lower SCFA concentrations in the colon (P < 0.05). The detrimental effects of probiotic bacteria in this study may relate to the specific strain and dose combination and may have involved the very immature gut immune system and low NEC incidence in the control group. It remains to be determined whether similar adverse responses to probiotics occur in preterm infants.
TI  - Effects of multistrain probiotic-containing yogurt on second-line triple therapy  for Helicobacter pylori infection.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The adjuvant effects of probiotic-containing yogurt on second-line triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection have not been evaluated. METHODS: A total of 337 patients with persistent H. pylori infection, after first-line triple therapy, were randomly assigned to receive either triple therapy with (yogurt group, n=151) or without (control group, n=186) Will yogurt. Triple therapy consisted of 400 mg moxifloxacin q.d., 1000 mg amoxicillin b.i.d., and 20 mg esomeprazole b.i.d. for 14 days. Will yogurt contains Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Bifidobacterium longum, and Streptococcus thermophilus. H. pylori eradication was evaluated by the (13)C-urea breath test, histology, or the rapid urease test. RESULTS: The eradication rates by intention-to-treat analysis were 66.7% and 68.9% in the control and yogurt groups, respectively (P=0.667). The eradication rates by per-protocol analysis were 78.5% and 86% in the control and the yogurt groups, respectively (P=0.110). The adverse event rates were 25.3% and 28.5% in the control group and yogurt group, respectively (P=0.508). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of yogurt containing probiotics to moxifloxacin-containing second-line treatment neither improved H. pylori eradication rates nor reduced the adverse events of treatment.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria fermentation of human milk oligosaccharide components, human milk oligosaccharides and galactooligosaccharides.
AB  - Human milk contains about 7% lactose and 1% human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) consisting of lactose with linked fucose, N-acetylglucosamine and sialic acid. In infant formula, galactooligosaccharides (GOSs) are added to replace HMOs. This study investigated the ability of six strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus reuteri, Streptococcus thermophilus and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris, to digest HMO components, defined HMOs, and GOSs. All strains grew on lactose and glucose. N-acetylglucosamine utilization varied between strains and was maximal in L. plantarum; fucose utilization was low or absent in all strains. Both hetero- and homofermentative LAB utilized N-acetylglucosamine via the Embden-Meyerhof pathway. Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. plantarum were the most versatile in hydrolysing pNP analogues and the only strains releasing mono- and disaccharides from defined HMOs. Whole cells of all six LAB hydrolysed oNP-galactoside and pNP-galactoside indicating beta-galactosidase activity. High beta-galactosidase activity of L. reuteri, L. fermentum, S. thermophilus and L. mesenteroides subsp. cremoris whole cells correlated to lactose and GOS hydrolysis. Hydrolysis of lactose and GOSs by heterologously expressed beta-galactosidases confirmed that LAB beta-galactosidases are involved in GOS digestion. In summary, the strains of LAB used were not capable of utilizing complex HMOs but metabolized HMO components and GOSs.
TI  - Alkalizing reactions streamline cellular metabolism in acidogenic microorganisms.
AB  - An understanding of the integrated relationships among the principal cellular functions that govern the bioenergetic reactions of an organism is necessary to determine how cells remain viable and optimise their fitness in the environment. Urease is a complex enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea to ammonia and carbonic acid. While the induction of urease activity by several microorganisms has been predominantly considered a stress-response that is initiated to generate a nitrogen source in response to a low environmental pH, here we demonstrate a new role of urease in the optimisation of cellular bioenergetics. We show that urea hydrolysis increases the catabolic efficiency of Streptococcus thermophilus, a lactic acid bacterium that is widely used in the industrial manufacture of dairy products. By modulating the intracellular pH and thereby increasing the activity of beta-galactosidase, glycolytic enzymes and lactate dehydrogenase, urease increases the overall change in enthalpy generated by the bioenergetic reactions. A cooperative altruistic behaviour of urease-positive microorganisms on the urease-negative microorganisms within the same environment was also observed. The physiological role of a single enzymatic activity demonstrates a novel and unexpected view of the non-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that govern the bioenergetics of a bacterial cell, highlighting a new role for cytosol-alkalizing biochemical pathways in acidogenic microorganisms.
TI  - Use of lactulose as prebiotic and its influence on the growth, acidification profile and viable counts of different probiotics in fermented skim milk.
AB  - Lactulose can be considered as a prebiotic, which is able to stimulate healthy intestinal microflora. In the present work, the use of this ingredient in fermented milk improved quality of skim milk fermented by Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Bifidobacterium lactis in co-culture with Streptococcus thermophilus. Compared to control fermentations without lactulose, the addition of such a prebiotic in skim milk increased the counts of all probiotics, with particular concern to B. lactis (bifidogenic effect), the acidification rate and the lactic acid acidity, and concurrently reduced the time to complete fermentation (t(pH4.5)) and the pH at the end of cold storage for 1 to 35 days.
TI  - Identification of a tyrosine decarboxylase gene (tdcA) in Streptococcus thermophilus 1TT45 and analysis of its expression and tyramine production in milk.
AB  - In this study, a tyrosine decarboxylase gene (tdcA) was identified in 1 among 83  Streptococcus thermophilus strains tested. Its sequence, nearly identical to that of a tdcA of Lactobacillus curvatus, indicated a horizontal gene transfer event. Transcription in milk and the formation of critical levels of tyramine were observed in the presence of tyrosine.
TI  - Complete genome sequence of Streptococcus thermophilus strain ND03.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus strain ND03 is a Chinese commercial dairy starter used for the manufacture of yogurt. It was isolated from naturally fermented yak milk in Qinghai, China. We present here the complete genome sequence of ND03 and compare it to three other published genomes of Streptococcus thermophilus strains.
TI  - Production of D-tagatose, a low caloric sweetener during milk fermentation using  L-arabinose isomerase.
AB  - Lactobacillusdelbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus are used for the biotransformation of milk in yoghurt. During milk fermentation, these lactic acid bacteria (LAB) hydrolyze lactose producing a glucose moiety that is further metabolized and a galactose moiety that they are enable to metabolize. We investigated the ability of L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus strains expressing a heterologous L-arabinose isomerase to convert residual D-galactose to D-tagatose. The Bacillus stearothermophilus US100l-arabinose isomerase (US100l-AI) was expressed in both LAB, using a new shuttle vector where the araA US100 gene is under the control of the strong and constitutive promoter of the L. bulgaricus ATCC 11842 hlbA gene. The production of L-AI by these LAB allowed the bioconversion of D-galactose to D-tagatose during fermentation in laboratory media and milk. We also established that the addition of L-AI to milk also allowed the conversion of D-galactose into D-tagatose during the fermentation process.
TI  - Identification of genes for small non-coding RNAs that belong to the regulon of the two-component regulatory system CiaRH in Streptococcus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Post-transcriptional regulation by small RNAs (sRNAs) in bacteria is  now recognized as a wide-spread regulatory mechanism modulating a variety of physiological responses including virulence. In Streptococcus pneumoniae, an important human pathogen, the first sRNAs to be described were found in the regulon of the CiaRH two-component regulatory system. Five of these sRNAs were detected and designated csRNAs for cia-dependent small RNAs. CiaRH pleiotropically affects beta-lactam resistance, autolysis, virulence, and competence development by yet to be defined molecular mechanisms. Since CiaRH is highly conserved among streptococci, it is of interest to determine if csRNAs are also included in the CiaRH regulon in this group of organisms consisting of commensal as well as pathogenic species. Knowledge on the participation of csRNAs in CiaRH-dependent regulatory events will be the key to define the physiological role of this important control system. RESULTS: Genes for csRNAs were predicted in streptococcal genomes and data base entries other than S. pneumoniae by searching for CiaR-activated promoters located in intergenic regions that are followed by a transcriptional terminator. 61 different candidate genes were obtained specifying csRNAs ranging in size from 51 to 202 nt. Comparing these genes among each other revealed 40 different csRNA types. All streptococcal genomes harbored csRNA genes, their numbers varying between two and six. To validate these predictions, S. mitis, S. oralis, and S. sanguinis were subjected to csRNA-specific northern blot analysis. In addition, a csRNA gene from S. thermophilus plasmid pST0 introduced into S. pneumoniae was also tested. Each of the csRNAs was detected on these blots and showed the anticipated sizes. Thus, the method applied here is able to predict csRNAs with high precision. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study strongly suggest that genes for small non-coding RNAs, csRNAs, are part of the regulon of the two-component regulatory system CiaRH in all streptococci.
TI  - A non-hydrolyzed, fermented milk formula reduces digestive and respiratory events in infants at high risk of allergy.
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: To determine the impact of a not hydrolyzed fermented infant formula containing heat-killed Bifidobacterium breve C50 and Streptococcus thermophilus 065 (HKBBST) on the incidence of allergy-like events during the first 2 years of life in children at high risk of atopy. SUBJECTS/METHODS: This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled study included infants at high risk of atopy. Infants used HKBBST or a standard infant formula (SIF) since birth until 1 year of age, and were followed at 4, 12 and 24 months after birth. Skin prick tests (SPTs) for six foods and six aeroallergens were systematically performed and adverse events (AEs) were recorded. In case of potentially allergic AE (PAAE), allergy could be further tested by SPT, patch tests and quantification of specific IgEs. If cow's milk allergy (CMA) was suspected, an oral challenge could also be performed. RESULTS: The study included 129 children, 63 were randomized to SIF, 66 to HKBBST. The use of HKBBST milk did not alter the proportion of CMA but decreased the proportion of positive SPT to cow's milk (1.7 vs 12.5%, P=0.03), and the incidence of digestive (39 vs 63%, P=0.01) and respiratory potentially allergic AEs (7 vs 21%, P=0.03) at 12 months, and that of respiratory PAAEs at 24 months (13 vs 35%, P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: HKBBST decreased the incidence of PAAEs in children with family history of atopy, during the first months of life and after the formula was stopped. Oral tolerance to cow's milk in infants at high risk of atopy may therefore be improved using not hydrolyzed fermented formulae.
TI  - FTIR-based polyphasic identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional Greek Graviera cheese.
AB  - This study used a combination of phenotypic, physical (Fourier Transformed Infra-Red [FTIR] spectroscopy) and molecular (RFLP and SSCP analysis of 16S rRNA genes) methods to identify the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) flora present in traditional Greek Graviera cheese after five weeks of ripening. A total of 300 isolates collected from high dilution plates of TSAYE (incubated at 30 degrees C), M-17 (22 degrees C) and M-17 (42 degrees C) agar media were clustered by FTIR and then representative strains of each cluster were cross-identified blindly by all methods. Based on their FTIR spectra, 282 isolates were LAB grouped in 28 clusters. The LAB species identified and their prevalence in the cheese samples were: Lactobacillus casei/paracasei (68.8%), Lactobacillus plantarum (19.5%), Streptococcus thermophilus (8.9%), Enterococcus faecium (2.1%), and Lactococcus lactis (0.7%). Also, Staphylococcus equorum (11 isolates), Corynebacterium sp. (5 isolates) and Brevibacterium sp. (1 isolate) were recovered from TSAYE. Comparative identification results showed that phenotypic and molecular methods were in mutual agreement as regards the LAB species identified. The present polyphasic identification approach based on rapid FTIR screening of 10-fold more isolates than a previous classical identification approach allowed or improved detection of few sub-dominant species; however the predominant LAB species in the cheese samples were the same with both approaches.
TI  - The CRISPR/Cas bacterial immune system cleaves bacteriophage and plasmid DNA.
AB  - Bacteria and Archaea have developed several defence strategies against foreign nucleic acids such as viral genomes and plasmids. Among them, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) loci together with cas (CRISPR-associated) genes form the CRISPR/Cas immune system, which involves partially palindromic repeats separated by short stretches of DNA called spacers, acquired from extrachromosomal elements. It was recently demonstrated that these variable loci can incorporate spacers from infecting bacteriophages and then provide immunity against subsequent bacteriophage infections in a sequence-specific manner. Here we show that the Streptococcus thermophilus CRISPR1/Cas system can also naturally acquire spacers from a self-replicating plasmid containing an antibiotic-resistance gene, leading to plasmid loss. Acquired spacers that match antibiotic-resistance genes provide a novel means to naturally select bacteria that cannot uptake and disseminate such genes. We also provide in vivo evidence that the CRISPR1/Cas system specifically cleaves plasmid and bacteriophage double-stranded DNA within the proto-spacer, at specific sites. Our data show that the CRISPR/Cas immune system is remarkably adapted to cleave invading DNA rapidly and has the potential for exploitation to generate safer microbial strains.

TI  - Probiotic yogurt effects on intestinal flora of patients with chronic liver disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic liver disease generally have intestinal flora imbalance that is related to the development and worsening of the disease. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of probiotic yogurt on intestinal flora of patients with chronic liver disease. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial, pretest-posttest control group design, was used. Patients were randomized to an experimental group (41 patients) or a control group (40 patients). Patients in the experimental group were given probiotic yogurt (one cup each time, three times per day for 14 days) containing Bacillus bifidus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, and Streptococcus thermophilus within 2 hours after meals. Levels of fecal flora, symptoms and signs, and laboratory examination indexes were collected. RESULTS: After intervention, the experimental group had a lower Escherichia coli count and reduced intestinal flora imbalance (p < .05). Comparison of the experimental and control groups after the intervention showed that the former had improved symptoms and signs, including significant improvement in debilitation, food intake, appetite, abdominal distension, and ascitic fluid (p < .05). CONCLUSION: Probiotic yogurt reduces the levels of intestinal flora imbalance and has an additional therapeutic effect on patients with chronic liver disease.
TI  - Assessment of microbial populations dynamics in a blue cheese by culturing and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  - The composition and development of microbial population during the manufacture and ripening of two batches of a blue-veined cheese was examined by culturing and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) (PCR-DGGE). Nine selective and/or differential media were used to track the cultivable populations of total and indicator microbial groups. For PCR-DGGE, the V3 hyper variable region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and the eukaryotic D1 domain of 28S rDNA were amplified with universal primers, specific for prokaryotes and eukaryotes, respectively. Similarities and differences between the results obtained by the culturing and the molecular method were recorded for some populations. Culturing analysis allows minority microbial groups (coliforms, staphylococci) to be monitored, although in this study PCR-DGGE identified a population of Streptococcus thermophilus that went undetected by culturing. These results show that the characterization of the microbial populations interacting and evolving during the cheese-making process is improved by combining culturing and molecular methods.
TI  - Increasing competence in the genus Streptococcus.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the most important model organisms for studies on natural genetic transformation in bacteria. The prevalence of this gene exchange mechanism in the genus Streptococcus has not been subjected to systematic investigations, but it has been known for decades that only a few streptococcal species develop the competent state spontaneously when grown under laboratory conditions. The recent discovery of a new mechanism regulating natural transformation in Streptococcus thermophilus suggested that this property might be more widespread among streptococci than previously thought. This suspicion has been confirmed by Mashburn-Warren and co-workers, who in the current issue of Molecular Microbiology report the discovery of a novel competence-inducing pheromone that is conserved in Streptococcus mutans and a number of pyogenic streptococci.
TI  - [Isolation and identification of probiotics from yoghourt in Beijing].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To carry out isolation and the viable plate count of probiotics from yoghourt. To investigate the antimicrobial susceptibility of strains to penicillin, gentamicin, ampicillin, vancomycin, clindamycin and erythromycin. METHODS: Probiotics were recovered and counted from yoghourt by plate count method. The recovered isolates were characterized by Gram's stain, biochemical test, antimicrobial susceptibility test. RESULTS: MRS medium and (36 +/- 1) degrees C were the optimum condition of culture. In total, 52 probiotic isolates were recovered from 31 yoghourt products, 12 (38.7%) products showed a lower probiotic quantity than 1 x 10(6) cfu/ml of the national stantard, and 19 (61.3%) products were higher than 1 x 10(6) cfu/ml. Gram's stain showed that 37 isolates were gram positive bacilli and 15 isolates were positive coccus. These 52 isolates were grouped into six species by biochemical method, including L. bulgaricus, S. thermophilus, L. acidophilus, L. casei, L. delbrueckii and L. fermentum. All 52 isolates were susceptible to penicillin and ampicillin, one isolate was resistant to both clindamycin and erythromycin, four isolates were resistant to vancomycin. CONCLUSION: Most of yoghourt products contained sufficient viable probiotics as required by the national standard. A small quantity of isolates were resistant to some antimicrobials and multi -drug resistant isolates were also found.
TI  - Bacillus subtilis CwlP of the SP-{beta} prophage has two novel peptidoglycan hydrolase domains, muramidase and cross-linkage digesting DD-endopeptidase.
AB  - For bacteria and bacteriophages, cell wall digestion by hydrolases is a very important event. We investigated one of the proteins involved in cell wall digestion, the yomI gene product (renamed CwlP). The gene is located in the SP-beta prophage region of the Bacillus subtilis chromosome. Inspection of the Pfam database indicates that CwlP contains soluble lytic transglycosylase (SLT) and peptidase M23 domains, which are similar to Escherichia coli lytic transglycosylase Slt70, and the Staphylococcus aureus Gly-Gly endopeptidase LytM, respectively. The SLT domain of CwlP exhibits hydrolytic activity toward the B. subtilis cell wall; however, reverse phase (RP)-HPLC and mass spectrometry revealed that the CwlP-SLT domain has only muramidase activity. In addition, the peptidase M23 domain of CwlP exhibited hydrolytic activity and could cleave d-Ala-diaminopimelic acid cross-linkage, a property associated with dd-endopeptidases. Remarkably, the M23 domain of CwlP possessed a unique Zn(2+)-independent endopeptidase activity; this contrasts with all other characterized M23 peptidases (and enzymes similar to CwlP), which are Zn(2+) dependent. Both domains of CwlP could hydrolyze the peptidoglycan and cell wall of B. subtilis. However, the M23 domain digested neither the peptidoglycans nor the cell walls of S. aureus or Streptococcus thermophilus. The effect of defined point mutations in conserved amino acid residues of CwlP is also determined.
TI  - Two strains of nonstarter lactobacilli increased the production of flavor compounds in soft cheeses.
AB  - The contribution to flavor generation and secondary proteolysis of 2 strains of mesophilic lactobacilli isolated from cheese was studied. Miniature soft cheeses (200 g) were produced with or without the inclusion of a culture of Lactobacillus plantarum I91 or Lactobacillus casei I90 in the starter composed of Streptococcus thermophilus. During ripening, cheeses containing the added lactobacilli showed an increased content of total free amino acids, but this increase was only significant in cheeses with Lb. plantarum I91. In addition, free amino acid profiles were modified by selective increases of some amino acids, such as Asp, Ser, Arg, Leu, and Phe. Cheeses inoculated with Lb. plantarum I91 or Lb. casei I90 were also characterized by a significantly higher concentration of diacetyl, a key flavor compound, and an increased content of acetoin. Results suggest an increase in the catabolism of either citrate or aspartate, with the production of the derived aroma compounds. Overall, aspartate content increased in both lactobacilli-added cheeses, whereas citrate was more or less constant, suggesting that aspartate could be the source of increased diacetyl and acetoin. A triangle aroma test showed that the addition of the lactobacilli strains significantly changed the sensory attributes of cheeses. At least 11 of 12 panelists commented that the aroma of cheeses with adjuncts was more buttery than that of control cheeses, which is desirable in most soft cheeses. Both Lb. plantarum I91 and Lb. casei I90 performed well as adjunct cultures by influencing cheese aroma development and cheese proteolysis.
TI  - Development of a versatile procedure based on natural transformation for marker-free targeted genetic modification in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - A versatile natural transformation protocol was established for and successfully  applied to 18 of the 19 Streptococcus thermophilus strains tested. The efficiency of the protocol enables the use of in vitro-amplified mutagenesis fragments to perform deletion or insertion of large genetic fragments. Depending on the phenotype linked to the mutation, markerless mutants can be selected either in two steps, i.e., resistance marker insertion and excision using an adapted Cre-loxP system, or in one step using a powerful positive screening procedure as illustrated here for histidine prototrophy.
TI  - Mixed-culture transcriptome analysis reveals the molecular basis of mixed-culture growth in Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus.
AB  - Many food fermentations are performed using mixed cultures of lactic acid bacteria. Interactions between strains are of key importance for the performance of these fermentations. Yogurt fermentation by Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus (basonym, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus) is one of the best-described mixed-culture fermentations. These species are believed to stimulate each other's growth by the exchange of metabolites such as folic acid and carbon dioxide. Recently, postgenomic studies revealed that an upregulation of biosynthesis pathways for nucleotides and sulfur-containing amino acids is part of the global physiological response to mixed-culture growth in S. thermophilus, but an in-depth molecular analysis of mixed-culture growth of both strains remains to be established. We report here the application of mixed-culture transcriptome profiling and a systematic analysis of the effect of interaction-related compounds on growth, which allowed us to unravel the molecular responses associated with batch mixed-culture growth in milk of S. thermophilus CNRZ1066 and L. bulgaricus ATCC BAA-365. The results indicate that interactions between these bacteria are primarily related to purine, amino acid, and long-chain fatty acid metabolism. The results support a model in which formic acid, folic acid, and fatty acids are provided by S. thermophilus. Proteolysis by L. bulgaricus supplies both strains with amino acids but is insufficient to meet the biosynthetic demands for sulfur and branched-chain amino acids, as becomes clear from the upregulation of genes associated with these amino acids in mixed culture. Moreover, genes involved in iron uptake in S. thermophilus are affected by mixed-culture growth, and genes coding for exopolysaccharide production were upregulated in both organisms in mixed culture compared to monocultures. The confirmation of previously identified responses in S. thermophilus using a different strain combination demonstrates their generic value. In addition, the postgenomic analysis of the responses of L. bulgaricus to mixed-culture growth allows a deeper understanding of the ecology and interactions of this important industrial food fermentation process.
TI  - Effect of bovine lactoferrin addition to milk in yogurt manufacturing.
AB  - The aim of this work was to study the effect of milk supplementation with lactoferrin of different iron saturation on the manufacturing and characteristics of yogurt. Bovine lactoferrin was added at concentrations of 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/mL in the holo (iron saturated) and apo (without iron) forms. Some physicochemical properties, such as pH, concentration of lactic acid, and texture of supplemented yogurts, were determined throughout the shelf-life period storage (28 d) at 4 degrees C. We also evaluated the stability of lactoferrin in supplemented yogurt throughout the storage time. The supplementation of milk with bovine lactoferrin did not greatly affect the physical properties of the yogurt, though apo-lactoferrin slightly delayed the decrease of pH. This could be attributed to the partial inhibition observed on the growth of Streptococcus thermophilus. The integrity and immunoreactive concentration of lactoferrin, determined by Western blotting and noncompetitive ELISA, respectively, remained constant throughout the shelf life of yogurt.
TI  - [Meta analysis of lactic acid bacteria as probiotics for the primary prevention of infantile eczema].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether lactic acid bacteria as probiotics is efficacious in the primary prevention of infantile eczema or atopic eczema. METHODS: For this meta analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCT) describing the efficacy of probiotics in infants with eczema or atopic eczema at ages of </=2 years, a comprehensive search in the databases was performed up to January 2010. Three reviewers independently evaluated the studies for methodological qualities. RevMan 5.0.2 software was used for meta analysis. RESULTS: Twelve RCTs on the preventive effects of lactic acid bacteria as probiotics on infantile eczema were included, and 7 of the 12 RCTs reported the preventive effect of lactic acid bacteria on atopic eczema. The meta analysis showed that there was an overall significant reduction in infantile eczema and atopic eczema favoring lactic acid bacteria compared with placebo. The relative risk (RR) ratios for eczema and atopic eczema were 0.80 (95%CI: 0.70-0.90; P<0.01) and 0.78 (95%CI: 0.64-0.97; P<0.01), respectively. Lactic acid bacteria combined with other probiotics decreased significantly the incidence of eczema, with a RR ratio of 0.79 (95%CI: 0.68-0.93; P<0.01). The use of lactic acid bacteria alone did not result in a reduction in the incidence of eczema, with a RR ratio of 0.85 (95%CI: 0.69-1.05; P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The data from this meta analysis suggest that lactic acid probiotics combined with other probiotics play a role in the prevention of infantile eczema. There is insufficient evidence to recommend single use of lactic acid bacteria for prevention of eczema. Further studies are required to determine whether the findings are reproducible.
TI  - Heterologous expression of glycoside hydrolase family 2 and 42 beta-galactosidases of lactic acid bacteria in Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - This study characterized a glycoside hydrolase family 42 (GH42) beta-galactosidase of Lactobacillus acidophilus (LacA) and compared lactose hydrolysis, hydrolysis of oNPG, pNPG and pNPG-analogues and galactooligosaccharides (GOSs) formation to GH2 beta-galactosidases of Streptococcus thermophilus (LacZ type), Lactobacillus plantarum and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris (both LacLM type). Beta-galactosidases were heterologously expressed in Lactococcus lactis using a p170 derived promoter; experiments were performed with L. lactis crude cell extract (CCE). The novel GH42 beta-galactosidase of Lb. acidophilus had lower activity on lactose, oNPG and pNPG but higher relative activity on pNP analogues compared to GH2 beta-galactosidases, and did not transgalactosylate at high lactose concentrations. Temperature and pH optima for lactose hydrolysis varied between GH2 beta-galactosidases. oNPG and pNPG were the preferred substrates for hydrolysis; in comparison, activity on pNPG-analogues was less than 1.5%. GH2 beta-galactosidases formed structurally similar GOS with varying preferences. The diversity of lactic acid bacteria beta-galactosidase activity in L. lactis CCE can be exploited in future nutritional or therapeutic applications.
TI  - [Identification of Lactobacillus and Streptococcus thermophilus by PCR amplification and sequence analysis of 16S rRNA].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a PCR method for identifying the 16S rRNA of Lactobacillus  and Streptococcus thermophilus at the species level. METHODS: Optimizing the method for DNA extraction and the conditions for PCR amplification. Joining the PCR amplification products from 16S rRNA to plasmid puc18-T and detecting the sequence. RESULTS: All 50 isolates recovered from yoghourt products were characterized by 16S rRNA sequence analysis and 7 groups were identified as L. bulgaricus (24 strains), S. thermophilus (12 strains), L. acidophilus (7 strains), L. casei (3 strains), L. delbrueckii (2 strains), L. fermentum (1 strain) and S. lutetiensis (1 strain). CONCLUSION: 16S rRNA PCR method developed in this research is a sensitive and reliable method for the identification of both Lactobacillus and Streptococcus thermophilus.
TI  - Sensitive lactate determination based on acclimated mixed bacteria and palygorskite co-modified oxygen electrode.
AB  - A sensitive bacteria biosensor was prepared for the detection of trace lactate. The sensitive bioelement, Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus mixed culture, and palygorskite, a perfect matrix for bacteria, was co-immobilized on the surface of oxygen electrode. The biosensor possesses fine selective specificity, good sensitivity and longer operational life time, which were due to the mutual help relationship of symbiotic bacteria and 240 days acclimation with lactate as the carbon source. Hydrodynamic amperometry, an advanced electrochemical method, is suitable for on-line monitoring the concentration change of dissolved oxygen that is closely accompanied with the metabolism of lactate. Electrochemical data show that the current is very sensitive to the changes of the concentration of lactate. The response current was linear with lactic acid concentration in the range from 0 to 300mumol L(-1), where the response time is no more than 240 s (R=0.9952), and the sensitivity was 1.87mA mol(-1)L. Experiments show the biosensor is also very useful for long time on-line monitoring of lactate, such as fermentation progress.
TI  - The effect of selected microbial strains on internal milieu of broiler chickens after peroral administration.
AB  - The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of probiotic preparation with  multi-strains composition (Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus LAT 187, Lactobacillus acidophilus LAT 180, Lactobacillus helveticus LAT 179, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. lactis LAT 182, Streptococcus thermophilus LAT 205 and Enterococcus faecium E 253) on internal milieu, antioxidant status and body weight of broiler chickens. Chickens were divided into three groups (C, control; E1 and E2, experimental groups). Experimental chickens received the probiotic preparation in drinking water. Probiotic preparation caused a significant increase of serum calcium and potassium content. In the group with higher dose of probiotic strains serum triglycerides level decreased. Total antioxidant status in groups with addition of probiotic strains showed higher values in comparison to control group. Serum albumin level was found to increase after consumption of probiotic preparation in group with higher dose of probiotic strains. Probiotic strains improved body weight in last observed weeks of feeding.
TI  - Microbial diversity, dynamics and activity throughout manufacturing and ripening  of Castelmagno PDO cheese.
AB  - The diversity, dynamics and activity of Castelmagno PDO cheese microbiota were studied in three batches produced in a floor valley farm, in the Grana Valley (northwest Italy), during the wintertime. Samples of milk, curd and cheese (core and subsurface) at different ripening time were submitted to both culture-dependent and -independent analysis. In particular, DNA and RNA directly extracted from the matrices were studied by PCR-Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR-DGGE. Culture-dependent methods highlighted the initial dominance of a thermophilic streptococcal population with the species Streptococcus thermophilus and S. agalactiae. Then, mesophilic lactococci occurred among isolates during manufacturing, with Lactococcus lactis which was also well represented in the first month of Castelmagno PDO ripening. At this point and throughout the ripening, lactobacilli prevailed in cheese samples, represented from Lactobacillus plantarum and Lb. casei. Culture-independent analysis underlined the undoubted role of L. lactis, actively involved in both Castelmagno PDO manufacturing and ripening. Despite Lb. helveticus was never isolated on selective media, a DGGE band referred to this microorganism was detected, at RNA level, in samples from ripened cheeses. On the other hand, Lb. plantarum was widely isolated from the plates, among lactobacilli, but never detected by direct analysis. Due to the importance of microbiota in the sensory richness and properties of traditional cheeses, new information have been added, in this work, on microbial diversity of Castelmagno PDO cheese.
TI  - Effect of fermentation by pure and mixed cultures of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus helveticus on isoflavone and B-vitamin content of a fermented soy beverage.
AB  - Enhancement of nutritional or vitamin content of foods is commonly touted as a major benefit of probiotics. In this paper, we examined the ability of three probiotic bacteria either alone or in combination to enhance nutritional content. Pure and mixed cultures of Streptococcus thermophilus ST5 and Lactobacillus helveticus R0052 or Bifidobacterium longum R0175 were used to prepare fermented soy beverages. The effects of strain, acidification and mixed cultures on the deconjugation of soy isoflavones were examined. Acidification to pH 4.7 alone resulted in a 7% drop in isoflavone levels. Deconjugation levels varied between the different glucosides. Fermentation by L. helveticus R0052 resulted in the 50% reduction in total glucosides with O-malonyl glucosides being reduced 64%. Fermentation by S. thermophilus ST5 or B. longum R0175 had no significant effect on isoflavone levels. Combining a S. thermophilus strain with a L. helveticus culture reduced the effectiveness of the latter. Fermentation did not significantly modify vitamin B1 or B6 levels.
TI  - Lactic acid fermentation of germinated barley fiber and proliferative function of colonic epithelial cells in loperamide-induced rats.
AB  - To develop a functional food from the dietary fiber fraction of germinated barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) (GBF), lactic acid fermentation was attempted using Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Bifidobacterium bifidus. The quality characteristics of the lactic acid-fermented product and its effect on gastrointestinal function in an animal model were examined. The anaerobic fermentation of 1% and 2% GBF yielded lactic acid bacteria at 8.9 +/- 1.0 x 10(8) and 1.6 +/- 0.2 x 10(9) colony-forming units/mL, and it was considered acceptable for consumption by sensory assessment. To determine the effect on gastrointestinal function, Sprague-Dawley rats were fed with three types of diets: a normal chow diet and chow diets supplemented with 10% lactic acid bacteria or a yogurt fermented with 2% GBF (GBFY). The rats fed GBFY for 6 weeks gained less body weight, excreted more fecal mass, and had improved gastrointestinal transit as examined with barium sulfate. The effect of GBFY on colonic epithelial proliferation was investigated through loperamide (LPM)-induced constipation in rats. The rats fed with GBFY for 6 weeks were intraperitoneally administered LPM twice daily for 7 days. GBFY supplementation decreased fecal excretion and moisture content in feces and depleted goblet cells as observed by hematoxylin and eosin stain. However, the rats supplemented with GBFY prior to the LPM administration had enhanced bowel movement, mucin secretion, and production of short-chain fatty acids compared with values for the LPM-alone group. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the GBFY supplement increased the numbers of nuclei stained positively for Ki-67 and extended from the base to the middle zone of crypts. These results indicate that GBFY alleviates constipation via the proliferation of the colonic crypts in LPM-administered rats.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of yogurt on aberrant crypt foci formation in the rat colon and colorectal tumorigenesis in RasH2 mice.
AB  - The inhibitory effects of yogurt consisting of milk fermented by Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strain 2038 and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus strain 1131 on formation of colonic aberrant crypt foci (ACF) in rats and also on development of colorectal tumors in transgenic mice harboring human prototype c-Ha-ras genes (rasH2 mice) were examined. F344 rats and rasH2 mice were fed commercial diet containing freeze-dried yogurt or starter medium (non-fermented milk). Rats were inoculated orally with heterocyclic amine 2-amino-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine hydrochloride (PhIP) for two weeks. The rats were necropsied 14 days after the PhIP treatment, and ACF in the colon and rectum were counted. RasH2 mice were injected with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine dihydrochloride (DMH) for 20 weeks. Three weeks after the last injection of DMH, rasH2 mice were necropsied to determine the number and the size of colorectal tumors. Yogurt supplementation in diet significantly reduced the number of ACF and aberrant crypts (ACs) in rats fed control diet (P<0.01), but not in rats fed non-fermented milk diet. On the other hand, rasH2 mice receiving the yogurt-supplemented diet had significantly reduced numbers of tumors induced by DMH compared with those fed the non-fermented milk-supplemented diet (P<0.05). These results demonstrate that the yogurt used in this study appears to have tumor-suppressing properties, and rasH2 mice are a useful model for the evaluation of antitumor activities of foods.
TI  - Efficacy of vaginal probiotic capsules for recurrent bacterial vaginosis: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We assessed the effectiveness of vaginal probiotic capsules for recurrent bacterial vaginosis (BV) prevention. STUDY DESIGN: One hundred twenty healthy Chinese women with a history of recurrent BV were assigned randomly to daily vaginal prophylaxis with 1 capsule (Probaclac Vaginal; Nicar Laboratories, Inc, Blainville, Quebec, Canada) that contained 8 billion colony-forming units of Lactobacillus rhamnosus, L acidophilus, and Streptococcus thermophilus (n = 58 women) or 1 placebo capsule (n = 62 women) for 7 days on, 7 days off, and 7 days on. RESULTS: Probiotic prophylaxis resulted in lower recurrence rates for BV (15.8% [9/57 women] vs 45.0% [27/60 women]; P < .001) and Gardnerella vaginalis incidence through 2 months (3.5% [2/57 women] vs 18.3% [11/60 women]; P = .02). Between the 2- and 11-month follow-up period, women who received probiotics reported a lower incidence of BV and G vaginalis. Aside from vaginal discharge and malodor, no adverse events were reported in either study group. CONCLUSION: Short-term probiotic prophylaxis is well tolerated and reduces BV recurrence and G vaginalis risk through 11 months after treatment.
TI  - Sequencing and transcriptional analysis of the Streptococcus thermophilus histamine biosynthesis gene cluster: factors that affect differential hdcA expression.
AB  - Histamine, a toxic compound that is formed by the decarboxylation of histidine through the action of microbial decarboxylases, can accumulate in fermented food products. From a total of 69 Streptococcus thermophilus strains screened, two strains, CHCC1524 and CHCC6483, showed the capacity to produce histamine. The hdc clusters of S. thermophilus CHCC1524 and CHCC6483 were sequenced, and the factors that affect histamine biosynthesis and histidine-decarboxylating gene (hdcA) expression were studied. The hdc cluster began with the hdcA gene, was followed by a transporter (hdcP), and ended with the hdcB gene, which is of unknown function. The three genes were orientated in the same direction. The genetic organization of the hdc cluster showed a unique organization among the lactic acid bacterial group and resembled those of Staphylococcus and Clostridium species, thus indicating possible acquisition through a horizontal transfer mechanism. Transcriptional analysis of the hdc cluster revealed the existence of a polycistronic mRNA covering the three genes. The histidine-decarboxylating gene (hdcA) of S. thermophilus demonstrated maximum expression during the stationary growth phase, with high expression levels correlated with high histamine levels. Limited expression was evident during the lag and exponential growth phases. Low-temperature (4 degrees C) incubation of milk inoculated with a histamine-producing strain showed lower levels of histamine than did inoculated milk kept at 42 degrees C. This reduction was attributed to a reduction in the activity of the HdcA enzyme itself rather than a reduction in gene expression or the presence of a lower cell number.
TI  - Specific metabolic activity of ripening bacteria quantified by real-time reverse  transcription PCR throughout Emmental cheese manufacture.
AB  - Bacterial communities of fermented foods are usually investigated by culture-dependent methods. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and reverse transcription (RT)-qPCR offer new possibilities to quantify the populations present and their metabolic activity. The aim of this work was to develop qPCR and RT-qPCR methods to assess the metabolic activity and the stress level of the two species used as ripening cultures in Emmental cheese manufacture, Propionibacterium freudenreichii and Lactobacillus paracasei. Three small scale (1/100) microbiologically controlled Emmental cheeses batches were manufactured and inoculated with Lactobacillus helveticus, Streptococcus thermophilus, P. freudenreichii and L. paracasei. At 12 steps of cheese manufacture and ripening, the populations of P. freudenreichii and L. paracasei were quantified by numerations on agar media and by qPCR. 16S, tuf and groL transcript levels were quantified by RT-qPCR. Sampling was carried out in triplicate. qPCR and RT-qPCR assessments were specific, efficient and linear. The quantification limit was 10(3) copies of cells or cDNA/g of cheese. Cell quantifications obtained by qPCR gave similar results than plate count for P. freudenreichii growth and 0.5 to 1 log lower in the stationary phase. Bacterial counts and qPCR quantifications showed that L. paracasei began to grow during the pressing step while P. freudenreichii began to grow from the beginning of ripening (in the cold room). Tuf cDNA quantification results suggested that metabolic activity of L. paracasei reached a maximum during the first part of the ripening (in cold room) and decreased progressively during ripening (in the warm room). Metabolic activity of P. freudenreichii was maximum at the end of cold ripening room and was stable during the first two weeks in warm room. After lactate exhaustion (after two weeks of warm room), the number of tuf cDNA decreased reflecting reduced metabolic activity. For L. paracasei, groL cDNA were stable during ripening. For P. freudenreichii, groL1 gene was highly-expressed during acidification, while groL2 gene highly expression was only observed at the end of the ripening stage after lactate (carbon substrate of P. freudenreichii) exhaustion. The potential use of 16S and tuf genes for the normalization of cDNA quantification throughout an Emmental cheese manufacture is discussed. For the first time, specific gene expression was performed by RT-qPCR yielding metabolic activity and stress response evaluation for L. paracasei and P. freudenreichii in cheese.
TI  - Effect of exopolysaccharide-producing strains of Streptococcus thermophilus on technological attributes of fat-free lassi.
AB  - Sixty-four exopolysaccharide-producing thermophilic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from traditionally made Indian fermented milk products. On the basis of morphological and biochemical tests, these isolates were identified as the species of Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus genera. Initial screening for technological attributes revealed that Streptococcus thermophilus IG16 was a promising isolate, and produced both capsular and ropy polysaccharides at the concentration of 211 mg/L. Exopolysaccharide produced by IG16 was a heteropolysaccharide containing rhamnose and galactose in a ratio of 5.3:1 and had a molecular weight of 3.3 x 10(4) Da. Use of IG16 as a starter culture controlled whey separation and improved viscosity, flavor, consistency, and color and appearance of lassi. Use of IG16 resulted in lassi having optimal acidity, less syneresis, high viscosity, and better scores for flavor, consistency, and color and appearance.
TI  - Viability of bifidobacteria strains in yogurt with added oat beta-glucan and corn starch during cold storage.
AB  - Probiotics must be consumed at a level of 10(7) CFU/mL for successful colonization of the gut. In yogurts containing beneficial cultures, the survival of probiotic strains can quickly decline below this critical concentration during cold storage. We hypothesized that beta-glucan would increase the viability of bifidobacteria strains in yogurt during cold storage. Yogurts were produced containing 0.44% beta-glucan (concentrated or freeze-dried) extracted from whole oat flour and/or 1.33% modified corn starch, and bifidobacteria (B. breve or B. longum) at a concentration of at least 10(9) CFU/mL. All yogurts were stored at 4 degrees C. Bifidobacteria and yogurt cultures, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbureckii subsp. bulgaricus, were enumerated from undisturbed aliquots before fermentation, after fermentation, and once a week for 5 wk. S. thermophilus and L. bulgaricus maintained a concentration of at least 10(8) CFU/mL in yogurts containing concentrated or freeze-dried beta-glucan regardless of starch addition, and in the control with no added beta-glucan or starch. Similarly, the probiotic, Bifidobacterium breve, survived above a therapeutic level in all treatments. The addition of beta-glucan prolonged the survival of Bifidobacterium longum at a concentration of at least 10(7) CFU/mL by up to 2 wk on average beyond the control. Further, the inclusion of concentrated beta-glucan in yogurt improved survival of B. longum above 10(7) CFU/mL by 1 wk longer than did freeze-dried beta-glucan. Study results suggest that beta-glucan has a protective effect on bifidobacteria in yogurt when stressed by low-temperature storage.
TI  - Microbial stability and safety of traditional Greek Graviera cheese: characterization of the lactic acid bacterial flora and culture-independent detection of bacteriocin genes in the ripened cheeses and their microbial consortia.
AB  - The microflora of four batches of traditional Greek Graviera cheese was studied at 5 weeks of ripening, and 200 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolates were phenotypically characterized and screened for antilisterial bacteriocins. The cheeses were also analyzed for organic acids by high-performance liquid chromatography and for the potential presence of 25 known LAB bacteriocin genes directly in cheese and their microbial consortia by PCR. All batches were safe according to the European Union regulatory criteria for Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, enterobacteria, and coagulase-positive staphylococci. The cheese flora was dominated by nonstarter Lactobacillus casei/paracasei (67.5%) and Lactobacillus plantarum (16.3%) strains, whereas few Streptococcus thermophilus (3.8%), Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (0.6%), and Leuconostoc (1.9%) organisms were present. Enterococcus faecium (9.4%) and Enterococcus durans (0.6%) were isolated among the dominant LAB from two batches; however, enterococci were present in all batches at 10- to 100-fold lower populations than mesophilic lactobacilli. Sixteen E. faecium isolates produced antilisterial enterocins. In accordance, enterocin B gene was detectable in all cheeses and enterocin P gene was present in one cheese, whereas the consortia of all cheeses contained at least two of the enterocin A, B, P, 31, L50A, and L50B genes. Plantaricin A gene was also amplified from all cheeses. Mean concentrations of lactic, acetic, citric, and propionic acids in the ripened cheeses exceeded 1.5% in total, of which approximately 0.9% was lactate. Thus, organic acid contents constitute an important hurdle factor for inhibiting growth of pathogens in traditional Graviera cheese products, with LAB bacteriocins, mainly enterocins, potentially contributing to increased cheese safety.
TI  - Inhibition of dynamin-dependent endocytosis interferes with type III IFN expression in bacteria-infected human monocyte-derived DCs.
AB  - Type I IFNs (IFN-alpha/betas) and type III IFNs (IFN-lambda1-3) play an important role in host defense against viral infections. The induction of type I IFNs has recently been found to take place also in bacterial infections, and therefore, this study focuses on analyzing the regulation of type III IFNs in response to bacterial stimulation. We found by quantitative RT-PCR that the expression of IFN-lambda1 and IFN-lambda2/3 mRNAs, as well as that of IFN-beta, was similarly up-regulated in response to stimulation with live Salmonella typhimurium or TLR4 agonist LPS in human moDCs. The induction of IFN-lambda mRNAs did not require ongoing protein synthesis, and only IFN-lambda1 was detected at the protein level. The induction of IFN-lambda mRNAs was sensitive to SB202190, Ly294002, and PDTC, which inhibit p38 MAPK, PI3K, and NF-kappaB activation, respectively. Furthermore, we observed that blocking dynamin-dependent endocytosis pathways with dynasore led to decreased cell surface expression of CD86 and HLA class II molecules and reduced production of IFN-lambda1, CXCL10, and IL-6 when the cells were infected with S. typhimurium. Cytokine production was also impaired in dynasore-treated, Streptococcus thermophilus-stimulated cells. Further, inhibition of dynamin prevented S. typhimurium-induced phosphorylation of IRF3 and the internalization of the bacteria. In summary, induction of type III IFNs in bacteria-infected human moDCs requires multiple signaling pathways and involves bacterial phagocytosis.
TI  - Effects of fermentation by lactic acid bacteria on the antigenicity of bovine whey proteins.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The main whey proteins alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-LA) and beta-lactoglobulin (beta-LG) are considered as the major allergens in cow's milk. Microbial fermentation can produce some proteolytic enzymes, which can induce the degradation of milk protein allergens. In this study, the effects of fermentation by lactic acid bacteria on the antigenicity of alpha-LA and beta-LG were investigated using indirect competitive ELISA. Meanwhile, the proteolysis of milk proteins was detected by TNBS assay and SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. RESULTS: Fermentation by lactic acid bacteria could significantly reduce the antigenicity of alpha-LA and beta-LG in skim milk. Combined strains of Lactobacillus helveticus and Streptococcus thermophilus were the most effective in reducing the antigenicity of both whey proteins. In addition, alpha-LA and beta-LG antigenicity decreased to a lower value at 6 h of fermentation and at 0.5 d of cold storage by fermentation with the combined strains. The results of TNBS assay and SDS-PAGE electrophoresis showed that lactic acid bacteria strains used in this study hydrolysed whey proteins only to a limited extent. CONCLUSION: The fermentation with lactic acid bacteria is an effective way to reduce whey proteins antigenicity.
TI  - Proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry monitoring of the evolution of volatile compounds during lactic acid fermentation of milk.
AB  - We apply, for first time, the recently developed proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-TOF-MS) apparatus as a rapid method for the monitoring of lactic acid fermentation (LAF) of milk. PTR-TOF-MS has been proposed as a very fast, highly sensitive and versatile technique but there have been no reports of its application to dynamic biochemical processes with relevance to the food industry. LAF is a biochemical-physicochemical dynamic process particularly relevant for the dairy industry as it is an important step in the production of many dairy products. Further, LAF is important in the utilization of the by-products of the cheese industry, such as whey wastewaters. We show that PTR-TOF-MS is a powerful method for the monitoring of major volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) formed or depleted during LAF, including acetaldehyde, diacetyl, acetoin and 2-propanone, and it also provides information about the evolution of minor VOCs such as acetic acid, 2,3-pentanedione, ethanol, and off-flavor related VOCs such as dimethyl sulfide and furfural. This can be very important considering that the conventional measurement of pH decrease during LAF is often ineffective due to the reduced response of pH electrodes resulting from the formation of protein sediments. Solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (SPME-GC/MS) data on the inoculated milk base and final fermented product are also presented to supporting peak identification. We demonstrate that PTR-TOF-MS can be used as a rapid, efficient and non-invasive method for the monitoring of LAF from headspace, supplying important data about the quality of the final product and that it may be used to monitor the efficacy of manufacturing practices.
TI  - Food processing increases casein resistance to simulated infant digestion.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine whether processing could modify the  resistance of casein (CN) to digestion in infants. A range of different dairy matrices was manufactured from raw milk in a pilot plant and subjected to in vitro digestion using an infant gut model. Digestion products were identified using MS and immunochemical techniques. Results obtained showed that CNs were able to resist digestion, particularly kappa- and alphas(2)-CN. Resistant areas were identified and corresponded to fragments hydrophobic at pH 3.0 (gastric conditions) and/or carrying post-translational modifications (phosphorylation and glycosylation). Milk processing led to differences in peptide patterns and heat treatment of milk tended to increase the number of peptides found in digested samples. This highlights the likely impact of milk processing on the allergenic potential of CNs.
TI  - Treatment of relapsing mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis with the probiotic VSL#3 as adjunctive to a standard pharmaceutical treatment: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: VSL#3 is a high-potency probiotic mixture that has been used successfully in the treatment of pouchitis. The primary end point of the study was to assess the effects of supplementation with VSL#3 in patients affected by relapsing ulcerative colitis (UC) who are already under treatment with 5-aminosalicylic acid (ASA) and/or immunosuppressants at stable doses. METHODS: A total of 144 consecutive patients were randomly treated for 8 weeks with VSL#3 at a dose of 3,600 billion CFU/day (71 patients) or with placebo (73 patients). RESULTS: In all, 65 patients in the VSL#3 group and 66 patients in the placebo group completed the study. The decrease in ulcerative colitis disease activity index (UCDAI) scores of 50% or more was higher in the VSL#3 group than in the placebo group (63.1 vs. 40.8; per protocol (PP) P=0.010, confidence interval (CI)(9)(5)(%) 0.51-0.74; intention to treat (ITT) P=0.031, CI(9)(5)(%) 0.47-0.69). Significant results with VSL#3 were recorded in an improvement of three points or more in the UCDAI score (60.5% vs. 41.4%; PP P=0.017, CI(9)(5)(%) 0.51-0.74; ITT P=0.046, CI(9)(5)(%) 0.47-0.69) and in rectal bleeding (PP P=0.014, CI(9)(5)(%) 0.46-0.70; ITT P=0.036, CI(9)(5)(%) 0.41-0.65), whereas stool frequency (PP P=0.202, CI(9)(5)(%) 0.39-0.63; ITT P=0.229, CI(9)(5)(%) 0.35-0.57), physician's rate of disease activity (PP P=0.088, CI(9)(5)(%) 0.34-0.58; ITT P=0.168, CI(9)(5)(%) 0.31-0.53), and endoscopic scores (PP P=0.086, CI(9)(5)(%) 0.74-0.92; ITT P=0.366, CI(9)(5)(%) 0.66-0.86) did not show statistical differences. Remission was higher in the VSL#3 group than in the placebo group (47.7% vs. 32.4%; PP P=0.069, CI(9)(5)(%) 0.36-0.60; ITT P=0.132, CI(9)(5)(%) 0.33-0.56). Eight patients on VSL#3 (11.2%) and nine patients on placebo (12.3%) reported mild side effects. CONCLUSIONS: VSL#3 supplementation is safe and able to reduce UCDAI scores in patients affected by relapsing mild-to-moderate UC who are under treatment with 5-ASA and/or immunosuppressants. Moreover, VSL#3 improves rectal bleeding and seems to reinduce remission in relapsing UC patients after 8 weeks of treatment, although these parameters do not reach statistical significance.
TI  - Genetic and proteomic analysis of factors affecting serum cholesterol reduction by Lactobacillus acidophilus A4.
AB  - This article identifies novel factors involved in cholesterol reduction by probiotic bacteria, which were identified using genetic and proteomic approaches. Approximately 600 Lactobacillus acidophilus A4 mutants were created by random mutagenesis. The cholesterol-reducing ability of each mutant was determined and verified using two different methods: the o-phthalaldehyde assay and gas chromatographic analysis (GC). Among screened mutants, strain BA9 showed a dramatically diminished ability to reduce cholesterol, as demonstrated by a 7.7% reduction rate, while the parent strain had a more than 50% reduction rate. The transposon insertion site was mapped using inverse PCR (I-PCR), and it was determined using bioinformatic methods that the deleted region contained the Streptococcus thermophilus catabolite control protein A gene (ccpA). In addition, we have shown using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) that several proteins, including a transcription regulator, FMN-binding protein, major facilitator superfamily permease, glycogen phosphorylase, the YknV protein, and fructose/tagatose bisphosphate aldolase, were strongly regulated by the ccpA gene. In addition, in vivo experiments investigating ccpA function were conducted with rats. Rats fed wild-type L. acidophilus A4 showed a greater than 20% reduction in total serum cholesterol, but rats fed BA9 mutant L. acidophilus showed only an approximately 10% reduction in cholesterol. These results provide important insights into the mechanism by which these lactic acid bacteria reduce cholesterol.
TI  - Folate: a functional food constituent.
AB  - Folate, a water-soluble vitamin, includes naturally occurring food folate and synthetic folic acid in supplements and fortified foods. Mammalian cells cannot synthesize folate and its deficiency has been implicated in a wide variety of disorders. A number of reviews have dwelt up on the health benefits associated with increased folate intakes and many countries possess mandatory folate enrichment programs. Lately, a number of studies have shown that high intakes of folic acid, the chemically synthesized form, but not natural folates, can cause adverse effects in some individuals such as the masking of the hematological manifestations of vitamin B(12) deficiency, leukemia, arthritis, bowel cancer, and ectopic pregnancies. As fermented milk products are reported to contain even higher amounts of folate produced by the food-grade bacteria, primarily lactic acid bacteria (LAB), the focus has primarily shifted toward the natural folate, that is, folate produced by LAB and levels of folate present in foods fermented by/or containing these valuable microorganisms. The proper selection and use of folate-producing microorganisms is an interesting strategy to increase "natural" folate levels in foods. An attempt has been made through this review to share information available in the literature on wide ranging aspects of folate, namely, bioavailability, analysis, deficiency, dietary requirements, and health effects of synthetic and natural folate, dairy and nondairy products as a potential source of folate, microorganisms with special reference to Streptococcus thermophilus as prolific folate producer, and recent insight on modulation of folate production levels in LAB by metabolic engineering.
TI  - Competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens in vitro.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the competition between probiotics in bio-yogurt and periodontal pathogens in vitro. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The antimicrobial activity of bio-yogurt was studied by agar diffusion assays, using eight species of putative periodontal pathogens and a 'protective bacteria' as indicator strains. Four probiotic bacterial species (Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium) were isolated from yogurt and used to rate the competitive exclusion between probiotics and periodontal pathogens. RESULTS: Fresh yogurt inhibited all the periodontal pathogens included in this work, showing inhibition zones ranging from 9.3 (standard deviation 0.6) mm to 17.3 (standard deviation 1.7) mm, whereas heat-treated yogurt showed lower antimicrobial activity. In addition, neither fresh yogurt nor heat-treated yogurt inhibited the 'protective bacteria', Streptococcus sanguinis. The competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens depended on the sequence of inoculation. When probiotics were inoculated first, Bifidobacterium inhibited Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas circumdentaria, and Prevotella nigrescens; L. acidophilus inhibited P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. circumdentaria, P. nigrescens, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius; L. bulgaricus inhibited P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, and P. nigrescens; and S. thermophilus inhibited P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum, and P. nigrescens. However, their antimicrobial properties were reduced when both species (probiotics and periodontal pathogens) were inoculated simultaneously. When periodontal pathogens were inoculated first, Prevotella intermedia inhibited Bifidobacterium and S. thermophilus. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that bio-yogurt and the probiotics that it contains are capable of inhibiting specific periodontal pathogens but have no effect on the periodontal protective bacteria.
TI  - Functional fermented whey-based beverage using lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Whey protein concentrate (WPC) is employed as functional food ingredient because  of its nutritional value and emulsifying properties. However, the major whey protein beta-lactoglobulin (BLG) is the main cause of milk allergy. The aim of this study was to formulate a fermented whey beverage using selected lactic acid bacteria and WPC35 (WPC containing 35% of proteins) to obtain a fermented product with low lactose and BLG contents and high essential amino acid concentration. Cell viability, lactose consumption, lactic acid production, proteolytic activity, amino acid release and BLG degradation by the selected strains Lactobacillus acidophilus CRL 636, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CRL 656 and Streptococcus thermophilus CRL 804, as single or mixed (SLaB) cultures were evaluated in WPC35 (10%, w/v) incubated at 37 degrees C for 24h. Then, the fermented WPC35 was mixed with peach juice and calcium lactate (2%, w/v) and stored at 10 degrees C for 28 days. During fermentation, single cultures grew 1.7-3.1 log CFU/ml and produced 25.1-95.0 mmol/l of lactic acid as consequence of lactose consumption (14.0-41.8 mmol/l) after 12h fermentation. L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CRL 656 was the most proteolytic strain (626 microg/ml Leu) and released the branched-chain essential amino acids Leu (16 microg/ml), Ile (27 microg/ml) and Val (43 microg/ml). All strains were able to degrade BLG in a range of 41-85% after 12h incubation. The starter culture SLaB grew 3.0 log CFU/ml, showed marked pH reduction, produced 122.0 mmol/l of lactic acid, displayed high proteolytic activity (484 microg/ml Leu) releasing Leu (13 microg/ml), Ile (18 microg/ml) and Val (35 microg/ml), and hydrolyzed 92% of BLG. The addition of calcium lactate to WPC35 maintained the drink pH stable during shelf life; no contamination was detected during this period. After 28 days, a decrease in cell viability of all strains was observed being more pronounced for L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CRL 656 and L. acidophilus CRL 636 (2.3 and 1.9 log CFU/ml, respectively). The results showed that WPC fermentation by rationally selected lactic acid bacteria might be used for developing functional beverages with improved characteristics such as reduced BLG content and increased branched-chain essential amino acids.
TI  - Response surface optimization of the cultivation conditions and medium components for the production of folate by Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Optimization of the cultivation conditions and medium components for folate production by the highest folate producing Streptococcus thermophilus strain RD102 was carried out using a 23 central composite design and surface modelling method of response surface methodology. As folate production was observed to be growth-associated, hence the desired responses selected for the optimization were both folate production and growth. The selected factors based on preliminary investigations were incubation period, concentrations of p-amino benzoic acid (PABA) the growth precursor, and lactose as carbon source. The optimum concentrations of PABA and lactose were found to be 300 micropm and 3% respectively at 72 h incubation. The optimized conditions resulted in an increase in folate production by 26% compared with control conditions (0% PABA and lactose at 37 degrees C). Using the method of experimental factorial design and response surface analysis, it was possible to determine optimal operating conditions to obtain a higher folate production by Strep. thermophilus. Therefore, this study constitutes a step in developing strategies to modulate the folate level to a higher level.
TI  - Structural analysis of the exopolysaccharide produced by Streptococcus thermophilus ST1 solely by NMR spectroscopy.
AB  - The use of lactic acid bacteria in fermentation of milk results in favorable physical and rheological properties due to in situ exopolysaccharide (EPS) production. The EPS from S. thermophilus ST1 produces highly viscous aqueous solutions and its structure has been investigated by NMR spectroscopy. Notably, all aspects of the elucidation of its primary structure including component analysis and absolute configuration of the constituent monosaccharides were carried out by NMR spectroscopy. An array of techniques was utilized including, inter alia, PANSY and NOESY-HSQC TILT experiments. The EPS is composed of hexasaccharide repeating units with the following structure: --> 3)[alpha-D-Glcp-(1 --> 4)]-beta-D-Galp-(1 --> 4)-beta-D-Glcp-(1 --> 4)[beta-D-Galf-(1 --> 6)]-beta-D-Glcp-(1 --> 6)-beta-D-Glcp-(1 -->, in which the residues in square brackets are terminal groups substituting backbone sugar residues that consequently are branch-points in the repeating unit of the polymer. Thus, the EPS consists of a backbone of four sugar residues with two terminal sugar residues making up two side-chains of the repeating unit. The molecular mass of the polymer was determined using translational diffusion experiments which resulted in Mw = 62 kDa, corresponding to 64 repeating units in the EPS.
TI  - Efficient bioconversion of lactose in milk and whey: immobilization and biochemical characterization of a beta-galactosidase from the dairy Streptococcus thermophilus LMD9 strain.
AB  - The gene encoding beta-galactosidase from dairy Streptococcus thermophilus strain LMD9 was cloned, sequenced and expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant enzyme was purified and showed high specific activity of 464 U/mg. This protein displays a homotetrameric arrangement composed of four 118 kDa monomers. Monitoring of the activity showed that this enzyme was optimally active at a wide range of temperatures (25-40 degrees C) and at pH from 6.5 to 7.5. Immobilization of the recombinant E. coli in alginate beads clearly enhanced the enzyme activity at various temperatures, including 4 and 50 degrees C, and at pH values from 4.0 to 8.5. Stability studies indicated that this biocatalyst has high stability within a broad range of temperatures and pH. This stability was improved not only by addition of 1 mM of Mn(2+) and 1.2 mM Mg(2+), but essentially through immobilization. The remarkable bioconversion rates of lactose in milk and whey at different temperatures revealed the attractive catalytic efficiency of this enzyme, thus promoting its use for lactose hydrolysis in milk and other dairy products.
TI  - Decrease in frequency of liquid stool in enterally fed critically ill patients given the multispecies probiotic VSL#3: a pilot trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diarrhea has adverse consequences for critically ill patients, health care staff, and health care costs. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of the multispecies probiotic VSL#3 in reducing the mean number of episodes of liquid stool in enterally fed critically ill patients. METHODS: A single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study was done in a 6-bed intensive care unit in a 330-bed public hospital in Australia. A total of 45 adults (20 intervention, 25 control) who required enteral nutrition for more than 72 hours were given VSL#3 or a placebo twice daily. The frequency (mean number of episodes per patient per day) and weight (grams per day) were determined for both liquid stool and liquid and loose (unformed) stool. RESULTS: The 2 groups of patients had no demographic or clinical differences. Patients received enteral nutrition for a mean of 8.5 days (SD, 5.4) and were studied for a mean of 11.9 days (SD, 5.6). Compared with the control group, the intervention group had a significant reduction in the frequency of liquid stools (incidence rate ratio, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.27 to 0.93; P = .03). Smaller but still significant differences also occurred between the groups in both the frequency of episodes and the weight of liquid and loose (unformed) stool. CONCLUSION: VSL#3 was effective in reducing the frequency of liquid stool in critically ill patients receiving enteral nutrition. Probiotics possibly can minimize diarrhea in critically ill tube-fed patients, but more controlled clinical trials are needed.
TI  - Identification of the bacterial biodiversity in koumiss by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and species-specific polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - Bacterial biodiversity in traditional koumiss fermented milk was studied by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Target DNA bands were identified according to the reference species ladder, constructed in this study. Comigrating bands present in the DGGE profiles were resolved by species-specific PCR. The results revealed a novel bacterial profile and extensive bacterial biodiversity in koumiss. The dominant lactic acid bacteria included Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus fermentum, and Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens. Frequently encountered bacterial species were Enterococcus faecalis, Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus kitasatonis, and Lactobacillus kefiri. Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus buchneri, and Lactobacillus jensenii were occasionally found in this product. In addition, L. buchneri, L. jensenii, and L. kitasatonis, which were never previously isolated by culture-dependent methods, were identified for the first time in the Xinjiang koumiss. Furthermore, conventional cultivation was performed by plating samples on M17, de Man-Rogosa-Sharpe, Halligan-Pearce, and Kenner fecal media. The results revealed that lactobacilli were the dominant species in the koumiss ecosystem, which was consistent with the results obtained by the DGGE analysis. This is the first systematic study of the microbial composition in koumiss, and our findings will be helpful in selecting appropriate strains for the manufacture of this product at the industrial level.
TI  - Physical properties of acid milk gels prepared at 37 degrees C up to gelation but at different incubation temperatures for the remainder of fermentation.
AB  - We investigated the effect of altering temperature immediately after gels were formed at 37 degrees C. We defined instrumentally measurable gelation (IMG) as the point at which gels had a storage modulus (G') > or = 5Pa. Gels were made at constant incubation temperature (IT) of 37 degrees C up to IMG, and then cooled to 30 or 33.5, or heated to 40.5 or 44 degrees C, at a rate of 1 degrees C/min and maintained at those temperatures until pH 4.6. Control gel was made at 37 degrees C (i.e., no temperature change during gelation/gel development). Gel formation was monitored using small strain dynamic oscillatory rheology, and the resulting structure and physical properties at pH 4.6 were studied by fluorescence microscopy, large deformation rheology, whey separation (WS), and permeability (B). A single strain of Streptococcus thermophilus was used to avoid variations in the ratios of strains that could have resulted from changes in temperature during fermentation. Total time required to reach pH 4.6 was similar for samples made at constant IT of 37 degrees C or by cooling after IMG from 37 to either 30 or 33.5 degrees C, but gels heated to 40 or 44 degrees C needed less time to reach pH 4.6. Cooling gels after IMG resulted in an increase in G' values at pH 4.6, a decrease in LT(max), WS, and B, and an increase in the area of protein aggregates of micrographs compared with the control gel made at constant IT of 37 degrees C. Heating gels after IMG resulted in a decrease in G' values at pH 4.6 and an increase in LT(max) values and WS. The physical properties of acid milk gels were dominated by the temperature profile during the gel-strengthening phase that occurs after IMG. This study indicates that the final properties of yogurt greatly depend on the environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, time/rate of pH change) experienced by the casein particles/clusters during the critical early gel development phase when bonding between and within particles is still labile. Cooling of gels may encourage inter-cluster strand formation, whereas heating of gels may promote intra-cluster fusion and the breakage of strands between clusters.
TI  - Intra- and interlaboratory performances of two commercial antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods for bifidobacteria and nonenterococcal lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - In a small-scale harmonization study involving nine laboratories in eight European countries, the intra- and interlaboratory performances of two commercially available systems, i.e., the VetMIC microplate system and Etest, for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of nonenterococcal lactic acid bacteria (NELAB) and bifidobacteria were analyzed. In addition, one laboratory also performed standard broth microdilution as a reference method. MICs of tetracycline, erythromycin, ampicillin, gentamicin, clindamycin, and streptomycin for the type strains of 25 species of NELAB and bifidobacteria and MICs of vancomycin for a selection of relevant taxa were determined. The previously described lactic acid bacterium susceptibility test medium (LSM) and related mixed-medium formulations, all including Iso-Sensitest broth as a basic component, were used as test media. The overall agreement of median MIC ranges +/- 1 log(2) dilution determined by the VetMIC and Etest methods with the median MICs determined by the reference method was very good for tetracycline, ampicillin, and streptomycin (92.3 to 100%) but low for erythromycin (19.5 to 30.7%) and clindamycin (50.0 to 80.8%). There was a consensus among the participating laboratories that VetMIC was preferred over Etest because of its lower cost, better growth support, and more uniform criteria for MIC end point reading. With the range for acceptable intralaboratory reproducibility being defined as the median MIC +/- 1 log(2) dilution, VetMIC results (with 69.2% of all data sets in the acceptable range) were shown to display greater reproducibility than Etest results (with 58.8% of all data sets in the acceptable range). Also at the interlaboratory level, the proportion of MIC values obtained with VetMIC that belonged to the complete agreement category (60.0%) was higher than the proportion of such values obtained with Etest (47.0%), which indicates a higher degree of interlaboratory reproducibility for the former method. Apart from some agent-specific effects, the majority of VetMIC and Etest replicate data sets were situated within a 1- to 2-log(2) dilution range, suggesting that the two methods can be considered to be equivalent for recognizing resistance phenotypes. This multicenter study has further validated the standard use of LSM and related mixed-medium formulations with commercially available systems and formed the basis for the ongoing development of the ISO 10932/IDF 223 standard for susceptibility testing of NELAB and bifidobacteria.
TI  - Therapeutic effect of Streptococcus thermophilus CRL 1190-fermented milk on chronic gastritis.
AB  - AIM: To investigate the potential therapeutic effect of exopolysaccharide (EPS)-producing Streptococcus thermophilus (S. thermophilus) CRL 1190 fermented milk on chronic gastritis in Balb/c mice. METHODS: Balb/c mice were fed with the fermented milk for 7 d after inducing gastritis with acetyl-salicylic acid (ASA, 400 mg/kg body weight per day for 10 d). Omeprazole was included in this study as a positive therapeutic control. The gastric inflammatory activity was evaluated from gastric histology and inflammation score, number of interleukin-10 (IL-10), interferon-gamma (INFgamma) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) cytokine-producing cells in the gastric mucosa, and thickness of the mucus layer. RESULTS: Animals receiving treatment with the EPS-producing S. thermophilus CRL 1190 fermented milk showed a conserved gastric mucosa structure similar to that of healthy animals. Inflammation scores of the fermented milk-treated mice were lower than those of mice in the gastritis group (0.2 + or - 0.03 vs 2.0 + or - 0.6, P < 0.05). A marked decrease in INFgamma(+) (15 + or - 1.0 vs 28 + or - 1.2, P < 0.05) and TNF-alpha(+) (16 + or - 3.0 vs 33 + or - 3.0, P < 0.05) cells and an increase in IL-10(+) (28 + or - 1.5 vs 14 + or - 1.3, P < 0.05) cells compared to the gastritis group, was observed. Also, an increase in the thickness of the mucus gel layer (2.2 + or - 0.6 vs 1.0 + or - 0.3; 5.1 + or - 0.8 vs 1.5 + or - 0.4 in the corpus and antrum mucosa, respectively, P < 0.05) compared with the gastritis group was noted. A milk suspension of the purified EPS from S. thermophilus CRL1190 was also effective as therapy for gastritis. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that fermented milk with S. thermophilus CRL 1190 and/or its EPS could be used in novel functional foods as an alternative natural therapy for chronic gastritis induced by ASA.
TI  - Characterisation of proteolysis profile of Argentinean sheep cheeses made by two  different production methods.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In this work the proteolysis profiles of Argentinean sheep cheeses made by two different production methods were studied in order to develop products with typical and defined features. Cheeses with a starter of Streptococcus thermophilus, curd cut to corn grain size, washed and heated to 43 degrees C (S cheeses) and cheeses with a mixed starter of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus, curd cut to rice grain size, unwashed and heated to 47 degrees C (L cheeses) were manufactured. The cheeses were ripened at 12 degrees C and 80% relative humidity for 180 days and samples were taken throughout this period. RESULTS: Gross composition and primary proteolysis were similar for both types of cheeses. Streptococci counts diminished from 10(9) to 10(7) colony-forming units g(-1) during ripening in both S and L cheeses. Lactobacilli counts in L cheeses decreased during ripening and disappeared at 180 days. L cheeses had significantly lower pH values and showed higher peptidolysis than S cheeses. Triangle sensory evaluation indicated important differences between the two types of cheeses. CONCLUSION: S cheeses had a low proteolysis level and a soft flavour, making them appropriate for consumption after a short ripening time. L cheeses had a higher proteolysis level and more intense sensory characteristics, making them appropriate for consumption after a longer ripening time.
TI  - Identification and characterization of the dominant lactic acid bacteria from kurut: the naturally fermented yak milk in Qinghai, China.
AB  - Forty-three samples of kurut, a kind of traditional naturally-fermented yak milk, were collected in Qinghai, China. One hundred and forty-eight lactic acid bacterial (LAB) strains were isolated and identified from the kurut samples according to phenotypic characterization and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Among them, 52 isolates belonged to the Lactobacillus strains. Ninety-six isolates were resolved to coccoid LAB. The results showed that these isolates belonged to five genera and thirteen different species and subspecies. Moreover, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus were the predominant population in these samples. This paper systematically studied the composition of LAB in kurut, which may provide raw data for further study involving probiotics strain selection and starter culture design for industrialization production of traditional fermented milk in the future.
TI  - Role of antioxidant enzymes in bacterial resistance to organic acids.
AB  - Growth in aerobic environments has been shown to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and to cause oxidative stress in most organisms. Antioxidant enzymes (i.e., superoxide dismutases and hydroperoxidases) and DNA repair mechanisms provide protection against ROS. Acid stress has been shown to be associated with the induction of Mn superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) in Lactococcus lactis and Staphylococcus aureus. However, the relationship between acid stress and oxidative stress is not well understood. In the present study, we showed that mutations in the gene coding for MnSOD (sodA) increased the toxicity of lactic acid at pH 3.5 in Streptococcus thermophilus. The inclusion of the iron chelators 2,2'-dipyridyl (DIP), diethienetriamine-pentaacetic acid (DTPA), and O-phenanthroline (O-Phe) provided partial protection against 330 mM lactic acid at pH 3.5. The results suggested that acid stress triggers an iron-mediated oxidative stress that can be ameliorated by MnSOD and iron chelators. These findings were further validated in Escherichia coli strains lacking both MnSOD and iron SOD (FeSOD) but expressing a heterologous MnSOD from S. thermophilus. We also found that, in E. coli, FeSOD did not provide the same protection afforded by MnSOD and that hydroperoxidases are equally important in protecting the cells against acid stress. These findings may explain the ability of some microorganisms to survive better in acidified environments, as in acid foods, during fermentation and accumulation of lactic acid or during passage through the low pH of the stomach.
TI  - Exploiting plants for glutathione (GSH) production: Uncoupling GSH synthesis from cellular controls results in unprecedented GSH accumulation.
AB  - Glutathione (GSH) is a key factor for cellular redox homeostasis and tolerance against abiotic and biotic stress (May et al., 1998; Noctor et al., 1998a). Previous attempts to increase GSH content in plants have met with moderate success (Rennenberg et al., 2007), largely because of tight and multilevel control of its biosynthesis (Rausch et al., 2007). Here, we report the in planta expression of the bifunctional gamma-glutamylcysteine ligase-glutathione synthetase enzyme from Streptococcus thermophilus (StGCL-GS), which is shown to be neither redox-regulated nor sensitive to feedback inhibition by GSH. Transgenic tobacco plants expressing StGCL-GS under control of a constitutive promoter reveal an extreme accumulation of GSH in their leaves (up to 12 micromol GSH/gFW, depending on the developmental stage), which is more than 20- to 30-fold above the levels observed in wild-type (wt) plants and which can be even further increased by additional sulphate fertilization. Surprisingly, this dramatically increased GSH production has no impact on plant growth while enhancing plant tolerance to abiotic stress. Furthermore, StGCL-GS-expressing plants are a novel, cost-saving source for GSH production, being competitive with current yeast-based systems (Li et al., 2004).
TI  - Pecorino Crotonese cheese: study of bacterial population and flavour compounds.
AB  - The diversity and dynamics of the dominant bacterial population during the manufacture and the ripening of two artisanal Pecorino Crotonese cheeses, provided by different farms, were investigated by the combination of culture-dependent and -independent approaches. Three hundred and thirty-three strains were isolated from selective culture media, clustered using Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism and were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The results indicate a decrease in biodiversity during ripening, revealing the presence of Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus species in the curd and in aged cheese samples and the occurrence of several lactobacilli throughout cheese ripening, with the dominance of Lactobacillus rhamnosus species. Bacterial dynamics determined by Denaturant Gradient Gel Electrophoresis provided a more precise description of the distribution of bacteria, highlighting differences in the bacterial community among cheese samples, and allowed to detect Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus buchneri and Leuconostoc mesenteroides species, which were not isolated. Moreover, the concentration of flavour compounds produced throughout cheese ripening was investigated and related to lactic acid bacteria presence. Fifty-seven compounds were identified in the volatile fraction of Pecorino Crotonese cheeses by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. Esters, alcohols and free fatty acids were the most abundant compounds, while aldehydes and hydrocarbons were present at low levels.
TI  - Effects of fermentation conditions and soybean peptide supplementation on hyaluronic acid production by Streptococcus thermophilus strain YIT 2084 in milk.
AB  - To increase the hyaluronic acid (HA) yield from Streptococcus thermophilus YIT 2084, fermentation conditions (pH, temperature, agitation, aeration) were optimized in milk-based medium, and the effects of supplemental soybean peptides, which have different molecular weight distributions, were determined. HA production was enhanced to approximately 100 mg/l at pH 6.8 and 33-40 degrees C. Agitation speed and aeration rate slightly affected HA production. Soybean peptides including those of high molecular weight (approximately 27 to 130 kDa) further increased HA production to 208 mg/l under the optimal condition (pH 6.8, 35 degrees C, 100 rpm), which was 20-fold greater than non-optimal condition. HA production was no longer related to the specific growth rate. The HA produced under the optimal condition included a large amount of high-molecular-weight fraction of 100 to 2000 kDa, compared with under the basal condition without optimization.
TI  - Potassium-activated GTPase reaction in the G Protein-coupled ferrous iron transporter B.
AB  - FeoB is a prokaryotic membrane protein responsible for the import of ferrous iron (Fe(2+)). A defining feature of FeoB is that it includes an N-terminal 30-kDa soluble domain with GTPase activity, which is required for iron transport. However, the low intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rate of this domain appears to be too slow for FeoB either to function as a channel or to possess an active Fe(2+) membrane transport mechanism. Here, we present crystal structures of the soluble domain of FeoB from Streptococcus thermophilus in complex with GDP and with the GTP analogue derivative 2'-(or -3')-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-beta,gamma-imidoguanosine 5'-triphosphate (mant-GMPPNP). Unlike recent structures of the G protein domain, the mant-GMPPNP-bound structure shows clearly resolved, active conformations of the critical Switch motifs. Importantly, biochemical analyses demonstrate that the GTPase activity of FeoB is activated by K(+), which leads to a 20-fold acceleration in its hydrolysis rate. Analysis of the structure identified a conserved asparagine residue likely to be involved in K(+) coordination, and mutation of this residue abolished K(+)-dependent activation. We suggest that this, together with a second asparagine residue that we show is critical for the structure of the Switch I loop, allows the prediction of K(+)-dependent activation in G proteins. In addition, the accelerated hydrolysis rate opens up the possibility that FeoB might indeed function as an active transporter.
TI  - Pategras cheese as a suitable carrier for six probiotic cultures.
AB  - The viability of five single-strain and one three-strain probiotic cultures was assessed during Pategras cheese ripening. Probiotics were inoculated into cheese-milk after a pre-incubation step - intended to improve their survival - or directly as a lyophilised culture; control cheeses without probiotics were also obtained. pH of probiotic and control cheeses was similar, except in probiotic cheeses containing the strain Lb. acidophilus B or the mixed culture. In these cases, the probiotic cheeses were more acid than their respective control cheeses. All the probiotics tested maintained counts above 107 cfu/g during the shelf-life settled for the product. Strains of the Lb. casei group: Lb. paracasei, Lb. casei and Lb. rhamnosus reached and kept the highest cell concentration during cheese ripening, followed by Lb. acidophilus and bifidobacteria. The direct addition of the probiotic cultures was more efficient than their inoculation after a pre-incubation step, for all the probiotics assayed. We have provided evidence that support the use of Pategras cheese as a performing food-based vehicle for probiotic bacteria.
TI  - CpG oligodeoxynucleotides induce strong up-regulation of interleukin 33 via Toll-like receptor 9.
AB  - We previously reported the strong immunostimulatory effects of a CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN), designated MsST, from the lacZ gene of Streptococcus (S.) thermophilus ATCC19258. Here we show that 24h of stimulation with MsST in mouse splenocytes and peritoneal macrophages strongly induces expression of interleukin (IL)-33, a cytokine in the IL-1 superfamily. Other IL-1 superfamily members, including IL-1alpha, IL-1beta and IL-18, are down-regulated after 24h of stimulation of MsST. We also found that MsST-induced IL-33 mRNA expression is inhibited by the suppressive ODN A151, which can inhibit Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9)-mediated responses. This is the first report to show that IL-33 can be induced by CpG ODNs. The strong induction of IL-33 by MsST suggests that it may be a potential therapeutic ODN for the treatment of inflammatory disease. The presence of a strong CpG ODN in S. thermophilus also suggests that the bacterium may be a good candidate as a starter culture for the development of new physiologically functional foods.
TI  - Characterization of a novel LysM domain from Lactobacillus fermentum bacteriophage endolysin and its use as an anchor to display heterologous proteins on the surfaces of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The endolysin Lyb5, from Lactobacillus fermentum temperate bacteriophage phiPYB5, showed a broad lytic spectrum against Gram-positive as well as Gram-negative bacteria. Sequence analysis revealed that the C terminus of the endolysin Lyb5 (Ly5C) contained three putative lysin motif (LysM) repeat regions, implying that Ly5C was involved in bacterial cell wall binding. To investigate the potential of Ly5C for surface display, green fluorescent protein (GFP) was fused to Ly5C at its N or C terminus and the resulting fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli. After being mixed with various cells in vitro, GFP was successfully displayed on the surfaces of Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus casei, Lb. brevis, Lb. plantarum, Lb. fermentum, Lb. delbrueckii, Lb. helveticus, and Streptococcus thermophilus cells. Increases in the fluorescence intensities of chemically pretreated L. lactis and Lb. casei cells compared to those of nonpretreated cells suggested that the peptidoglycan was the binding ligand for Ly5C. Moreover, the pH and concentration of sodium chloride were optimized to enhance the binding capacity of GFP-Ly5C, and high-intensity fluorescence of cells was observed under optimal conditions. All results suggested that Ly5C was a novel anchor for constructing a surface display system for lactic acid bacteria (LAB). To demonstrate the applicability of the Ly5C-mediated surface display system, beta-galactosidase (beta-Gal) from Paenibacillus sp. strain K1, replacing GFP, was functionally displayed on the surfaces of LAB cells via Ly5C. The success in surface display of GFP and beta-Gal opened up the feasibility of employing the cell wall anchor of bacteriophage endolysin for surface display in LAB.
TI  - Enzymatic fragmentation of the antimicrobial peptides casocidin and isracidin by  Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus.
AB  - The cumulative effect of peptidase and protease activities associated with cells  of Streptococcus thermophilus (ST) and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (LB) was evaluated on the milk protein-based antimicrobial peptides casocidin and isracidin. Reaction mixtures of casocidin or isracidin and nonproliferating mid-log cells of these essential yogurt starter cultures were individually incubated for up to 4 h at pH 4.5 and 7.0, and samples removed at various time points were analyzed by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS. Both casocidin and isracidin remained largely unchanged following exposure to cell suspensions of ST or LB strains at pH 4.5. Casocidin was extensively degraded by both ST and LB strains at pH 7.0, whereas isracidin remained largely intact after incubation for 4 h with ST strains but was degraded by exposure to LB strains. The results showed the feasibility of using the bovine casein-based peptides casocidin and isracidin as food grade antimicrobial supplements to impart fermented dairy foods additional protection against bacterial contamination. The structural integrity and efficacy of these biodefensive peptides may be preserved by timing their addition near the end of the fermentation of yogurt-like dairy foods (at or below pH 4.5), when conditions for bacterial proteolytic activity become unfavorable.
TI  - Identification of a potent immunostimulatory oligodeoxynucleotide from Streptococcus thermophilus lacZ.
AB  - Immunostimulatory sequences of oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs), such as CpG ODNs, are potent stimulators of innate immunity. Here, we identified a strong immunostimulatory CpG ODN, which we named MsST, from the lac Z gene of Streptococcus (S.) thermophilus ATCC19258, and we evaluated its immune functions. In in vitro studies, MsST had a similar ability as the murine prototype CpG ODN 1555 to induce inflammatory cytokine production and cell proliferation. In mouse splenocytes, MsST increased the number of CD80+CD11c+and CD86+CD11c+ dendritic cells and CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells. We also analyzed the effects of MsST on the expression of regulatory cytokines by real-time quantitative PCR. MsST was more potent at inducing interleukin-10 expression than the ODN control 1612, indicating that MsST can augment the regulatory T cell response via Toll-like receptor 9, which plays an important role in suppressing T helper type 2 responses. These results suggest that S. thermophilus, whose genes include a strong Immunostimulatory sequence-ODN, is a good candidate for a starter culture to develop new physiologically functional foods and feeds.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance of probiotic strains of lactic acid bacteria isolated from  marketed foods and drugs.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the antimicrobial resistance of commercial lactic acid bacteria present in microbial foods and drug additives by analyzing their isolated strains used for fermentation and probiotics. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility of 41 screened isolates was tested with disc diffusion and E-test methods after species-level identification. Resistant strains were selected and examined for the presence of resistance genes by PCR. RESULTS: Distribution of resistance was found in different species. All isolates were susceptible to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cephalothin, and imipenem. In addition, isolates resistant to vancomycin, rifampicin, streptomycin, bacitracin, and erythromycin were detected, although the incidence of resistance to these antibiotics was relatively low. In contrast, most strains were resistant to ciprofloxacin, amikacin, trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole, and gentamycin. The genes msrC, vanX, and dfrA were detected in strains of Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus plantarum, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Lactococcus lactis. CONCLUSION: Antibiotic resistance is present in different species of probiotic strains, which poses a threat to food safety. Evaluation of the safety of lactic acid bacteria for human consumption should be guided by established criteria, guidelines and regulations.
TI  - A microfluidic approach for high efficiency extraction of low molecular weight RNA.
AB  - The lack of sample pre-treatment concepts that are easily automatable, miniaturized and highly efficient for both small volumes and low target concentrations, is one of the key issues that block the road towards effective miniaturized diagnostic instruments. This paper presents a novel, highly efficient and simple method for low-molecular weight RNA extraction using electricity only. Cells are lysed by thermo-electric lysis and RNA is purified using a gel-electrophoretic purification step. The combination of the two steps in one integrated cartridge reduces the time frame between the two steps, thus protecting RNA from enzymatic degradation. A disposable chip solution is proposed using a novel dry film resist laminate technology that allows cheap, large-scale fabrication. The chip contains crucial microfluidic innovations that allow for a simple user interface, reproducible functioning and precise quantification. Phaseguides are invented that allow controlled spatial injection of gel, injection of sample and recovery of extracted RNA. A precise sample volume can be defined by integrating electrophoretic actuation electrodes in the microfluidic chamber. Electrolytic gas bubbles that are the result of constant-current actuation are driven out from the chip by the novel introduction of capillary bubble-expulsion techniques. The extraction approach and the functionality of the chip are demonstrated for Escherichia coli and Streptococcus thermophilus bacteria. Linear extraction behavior is obtained for transfer-messenger RNA down to one colony-forming unit per microlitre, or five colony-forming units per chip. The latter is an increase in extraction efficiency of a factor of 1000 with respect to the commercial extraction kit Ambion Ribopure. The chip shows particularly good performance for extraction of low-molecular weight RNA, thereby eliminating the need for large ribosomal RNA and DNA removal. RNA can be extracted in less than 11 min, being a speed-up of more than a factor of 20 with respect to commercial extraction kits. The presented solution may find broad acceptance and application in drug discovery and clinical diagnostics.
TI  - The cell envelope subtilisin-like proteinase is a virulence determinant for Streptococcus suis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus suis is a major swine pathogen and zoonotic agent that  mainly causes septicemia, meningitis, and endocarditis. It has recently been suggested that proteinases produced by S. suis (serotype 2) are potential virulence determinants. In the present study, we screened a S. suis mutant library created by the insertion of Tn917 transposon in order to isolate a mutant deficient in a cell surface proteinase. We characterized the gene and assessed the proteinase for its potential as a virulence factor. RESULTS: Two mutants (G6G and M3G) possessing a single Tn917 insertion were isolated. The affected gene coded for a protein (SSU0757) that shared a high degree of identity with Streptococccus thermophilus PrtS (95.9%) and, to a lesser extent, with Streptococcus agalactiae CspA (49.5%), which are cell surface serine proteinases. The SSU0757 protein had a calculated molecular mass of 169.6 kDa and contained the catalytic triad characteristic of subtilisin family proteinases: motif I (Asp200), motif II (His239), and motif III (Ser568). SSU0757 also had the Gram-positive cell wall anchoring motif (Leu-Pro-X-Thr-Gly) at the carboxy-terminus, which was followed by a hydrophobic domain. All the S. suis isolates tested, which belonged to different serotypes, possessed the gene encoding the SSU0757 protein. The two mutants devoid of subtilisin-like proteinase activity had longer generation times and were more susceptible to killing by whole blood than the wild-type parent strain P1/7. The virulence of the G6G and M3G mutants was compared to the wild-type strain in the CD1 mouse model. Significant differences in mortality rates were noted between the P1/7 group and the M3G and G6G groups (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In summary, we identified a gene coding for a cell surface subtilisin-like serine proteinase that is widely distributed in S. suis. Evidences were brought for the involvement of this proteinase in S. suis virulence.
TI  - Heat shock effects on the viability of Cronobacter sakazakii during the dehydration, fermentation, and storage of lactic cultured milk products.
AB  - In the present study, the viability of heat-shocked and non-shocked Cronobacter sakazakii, a foodborne pathogen, after drying and during the fermentation as well as storage of lactic cultured milk was evaluated. It was found that heat shock increased the viability of C. sakazakii. The pure culture of C. sakazakii, regardless of heat shock, grew rapidly in skim milk with a viable population of ca. 8.59-8.70 log cfu/ml after ca. 48 h of cultivation. Thereafter, the viable population of C. sakazakii remained stable. While in the mix culture with Streptococcus thermophilus or Lactobacillus bulgaricus, a marked reduction in the viable population of C. sakazakii was noted after 24 h of cultivation in skim milk. Nevertheless, at the end of fermentation, the heat-shocked C. sakazakii had a viable population of 5.93-6.01 log cfu/ml, which is significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of non-shocked cells of 4.96-4.99 log cfu/ml. While the presence of C. sakazakii did not affect the growth of lactic acid bacteria in skim milk. Additionally, heat shock was found to enhance the survival of C. sakazakii after freeze-drying or spray-drying and during the storage of the lactic fermented milk products (pH 4.3) at 5 degrees C for 48 h.

TI  - A food-grade site-directed mutagenesis system for Streptococcus thermophilus LMG  18311.
AB  - AIMS: To develop a general method for site-directed mutagenesis in the dairy starter strain Streptococcus thermophilus LMG 18311 which does not depend on antibiotic-resistance genes or other selection markers for the identification of transformants. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a previous study, we demonstrated that Strep. thermophilus LMG 18311 can be made competent for natural genetic transformation by overexpression of the alternative sigma factor ComX. In the present study, we wanted to investigate whether the natural transformation mechanism of Strep. thermophilus LMG 18311 is efficient enough to make it feasible to perform site-directed mutagenesis in this strain without the use of a selection marker. Competent bacteria were mixed with a DNA fragment engineered to contain a nonsense and a frameshift mutation in the middle of the target gene (lacZ) and subsequently seeded on agar plates. By performing colony-lift hybridization using a digoxigenin-labelled oligonucleotide probe, we succeeded in identifying transformants containing the sought after mutation. CONCLUSIONS: By exploiting the natural transformability of Strep. thermophilus LMG 18311 and standard molecular methods, we have demonstrated that the genome of this bacterium can be altered at preselected sites without introduction of any foreign DNA. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: A food-grade site-directed mutagenesis system has been developed for Strep. thermophilus LMG 18311 that can be used by the dairy industry to construct starter strains with novel and/or improved properties.
TI  - Characterization of Streptococcus thermophilus lytic bacteriophages from mozzarella cheese plants.
AB  - Phage infection still represents the main cause of fermentation failure during the mozzarella cheese manufacturing, where Streptococcus thermophilus is widely employed as starter culture. Thereby, the success of commercial lactic starter cultures is closely related to the use of strains with low susceptibility to phage attack. The characterization of lytic S. thermophilus bacteriophages is an important step for the selection and use of starter cultures. The aim of this study was to characterize 26 bacteriophages isolated from mozzarella cheese plants in terms of their host range, DNA restriction profile, DNA packaging mechanism, and the variable region VR2 of the antireceptor gene. The DNA restriction analysis was carried out by using the restriction enzymes EcoRV, PstI, and HindIII. The bacteriophages were distinguished into two main groups of S. thermophilus phages (cos- and pac-type) using a multiplex PCR method based on the amplification of conserved regions in the genes coding for the major structural proteins. All the phages belonged to the cos-type group except one, phage 1042, which gave a PCR fragment distinctive of pac-type group. Furthermore, DNA sequencing of the variable region VR2 of the antireceptor gene allowed to classify the phages and examine the correlation between typing profile and host range. Finally, bacterial strains used in this study were investigated for the presence of temperate phages by induction with mitomycin C and only S. thermophilus CHCC2070 was shown to be lysogenic.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of some lactic acid bacteria isolated from an Algerian dairy product.
AB  - In the present study, the antibacterial effect of 20 lactic acid bacteria isolates from a traditional cheese was investigated. 6 isolates showed antibacterial effect against Gram positive bacteria. Streptococcus thermophilus T2 strain showed the wide inhibitory spectrum against the Gram positive bacteria. Growth and bacteriocin production profiles showed that the maximal bacteriocin production, by S. thermophilus T2 cells, was measured by the end of the late-log phase (90 AU ml(-1)) with a bacteriocine production rate of 9.3 (AU ml(-1)) h(-1). In addition, our findings showed that the bacteriocin, produced by S. thermophilus T2, was stable over a wide pH range (4-8); this indicates that such bacteriocin may be useful in acidic as well as nonacidic food. This preliminarily work shows the potential application of autochthonous lactic acid bacteria to improve safety of traditional fermented food.
TI  - A novel pheromone quorum-sensing system controls the development of natural competence in Streptococcus thermophilus and Streptococcus salivarius.
AB  - In streptococcal species, the key step of competence development is the transcriptional induction of comX, which encodes the alternative sigma factor sigma(X), which positively regulates genes necessary for DNA transformation. In Streptococcus species belonging to the mitis and mutans groups, induction of comX relies on the activation of a three-component system consisting of a secreted pheromone, a histidine kinase, and a response regulator. In Streptococcus thermophilus, a species belonging to the salivarius group, the oligopeptide transporter Ami is essential for comX expression under competence-inducing conditions. This suggests a different regulation pathway of competence based on the production and reimportation of a signal peptide. The objective of our work was to identify the main actors involved in the early steps of comX induction in S. thermophilus LMD-9. Using a transcriptomic approach, four highly induced early competence operons were identified. Among them, we found a Rgg-like regulator (Ster_0316) associated with a nonannotated gene encoding a 24-amino-acid hydrophobic peptide (Shp0316). Through genetic deletions, we showed that these two genes are essential for comX induction. Moreover, addition to the medium of synthetic peptides derived from the C-terminal part of Shp0316 restored comX induction and transformation of a Shp0316-deficient strain. These peptides also induced competence in S. thermophilus and Streptococcus salivarius strains that are poorly transformable or not transformable. Altogether, our results show that Ster_0316 and Shp0316, renamed ComRS, are the two members of a novel quorum-sensing system responsible for comX induction in species from the salivarius group, which differs from the classical phosphorelay three-component system identified previously in streptococci.
TI  - Multistep mechanism of probiotic bacterium, the effect on innate immune system.
AB  - The etiology and pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease are still not fully understood. However, evidence from both animal models and clinical observations suggests luminal bacteria as the most probable inducer of this disease. The intestinal bacterial microbiota may be modified by dietary addition of viable probiotic bacteria, thereby constituting an alternative approach to disease prevention and treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the effects of two probiotic regiments; Lactobacillus GG and a mixture of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium lactis (YO-MIX Y 109 FRO 1000) in both normal and trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid colitis-induced rats. Colon morphology and damage were evaluated histologically; colonic tissues were used for mRNA analysis, using real-time PCR. Administration of both probiotics reduced the expression of proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha and IL-6 and increased the expression of mucin 2 in compared with colitis group and reduced the inflammatory response. These results provide additional support for the positive effect of probiotics in the gut and may shed light on the mechanism by which probiotic bacteria exert their action in an animal model.
TI  - Nisin-induced expression of pediocin in dairy lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: To test whether a single vector, nisin-controlled expression (NICE) system  could be used to regulate expression of the pediocin operon in Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and Lactobacillus casei. METHODS AND RESULTS: The intact pediocin operon was cloned immediately into pMSP3535 downstream of the nisA promoter (PnisA). The resulting vector, pRSNPed, was electrotransformed into Strep. thermophilus ST128, L. lactis subsp. lactis ML3 and Lact. casei C2. Presence of the intact vector was confirmed by PCR, resulting in the amplification of a 0.8-kb DNA fragment, and inhibition zones were observed for all lactic acid bacteria (LAB) transformants following induction with 50 ng ml(-1) nisin, when Listeria monocytogenes Scott A was used as the target bacterium. Using L. monocytogenes NR30 as target, the L. lactis transformants produced hazy zones of inhibition, while the Lact. casei transformants produced clear zones of inhibition. Zones of inhibition were not observed when the Strep. thermophilus transformants were tested against NR30. CONCLUSIONS: The LAB hosts were able to produce enough pediocin to inhibit the growth of L. monocytogenes Scott A; the growth of L. monocytogenes NR30 was effectively inhibited only by the Lact. casei transformants. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first time that the NICE system has been used to express the intact pediocin operon in these LAB hosts. This system could allow for the in situ production of pediocin in fermented dairy foods supplemented with nisin to prevent listeria contamination.
TI  - Hydrolytic breakdown of lactoferricin by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Lactoferricin is a 25-amino acid antimicrobial peptide fragment that is liberated by pepsin digestion of lactoferrin present in bovine milk. Along with its antibacterial properties, lactoferricin has also been reported to have immunostimulatory, antiviral, and anticarcinogenic effects. These attributes provide lactoferricin and other natural bioactive peptides with the potential to be functional food ingredients that can be used by the food industry in a variety of applications. At present, commercial uses of these types of compounds are limited by the scarcity of information on their ability to survive food processing environments. We have monitored the degradation of lactoferricin during its incubation with two types of lactic acid bacteria used in the yogurt-making industry, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, with the aim of assessing the stability of this milk protein-derived peptide under simulated yogurt-making conditions. Analysis of the hydrolysis products isolated from these experiments indicates degradation of this peptide near neutral pH by lactic acid bacteria-associated peptidases, the extent of which was influenced by the bacterial strain used. However, the data also showed that compared to other milk-derived bioactive peptides that undergo complete degradation under these conditions, the 25-amino acid lactoferricin is apparently more resistant, with approximately 50% of the starting material remaining after 4 h of incubation. These findings imply that lactoferricin, as a natural milk protein-derived peptide, has potential applications in the commercial production of yogurt-like fermented dairy products as a multi-functional food ingredient.
TI  - Physicochemical, microbial, and sensory properties of yogurt supplemented with nanopowdered chitosan during storage.
AB  - This study was carried out to determine the possibility of adding nanopowdered chitosan (NPC) into cholesterol-reduced yogurt to improve the functionality of yogurt and the effects of adding NPC on the physicochemical, microbial, and sensory properties of the products during storage. The pH values and mean lactic acid bacteria counts of NPC-added (0.3 to approximately 0.7%, wt/vol) and cholesterol-reduced yogurt ranged from 4.19 to 4.41 and from 4.75 x 10(8) to 9.70 x 10(8) cfu/mL, respectively, when stored at 4 degrees C for 20 d, thereby indicating a possibility of prolonging the shelf life of yogurt. In color, the a* and b* values for cholesterol-reduced yogurt were not significantly influenced by the addition of NPC (0.1 to approximately 0.7%, wt/vol); however, the L* values significantly decreased with the addition of the greatest concentration (0.7%, wt/vol) of NPC at 0-d storage. The sensory test revealed that the astringency scores significantly increased at 0-d storage when the greatest concentration (0.7%, wt/vol) of NPC was added into cholesterol-reduced yogurt. Based on the data obtained from the current study, it is concluded that concentrations (0.3 to ~0.5%, vol/vol) of NPC could be used to produce an NPC-added and cholesterol-reduced yogurt without significantly adverse effects on the physicochemical, microbial, and sensory properties.
TI  - Emergence of a cell wall protease in the Streptococcus thermophilus population.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus is perceived as a recently emerged food bacterium that evolved from a commensal ancestor by loss and gain of functions. Here, we provide data allowing a better understanding of this evolutionary scheme. A multilocus sequence typing approach that we developed showed that S. thermophilus diverges significantly from its potential ancestors of the salivarius group and displays a low level of allelic variability, confirming its likely recent emergence. An analysis of the origin and dissemination of the prtS gene was carried out within this evolutionary scheme. This gene encodes a protease that allows better growth in milk by facilitating casein breakdown to supply amino acids. The S. thermophilus protease exhibits 95% identity to the animal Streptococcus suis protein PrtS. Genomic analysis showed that prtS is part of an island flanked by two tandem insertion sequence elements and containing three other genes which present the best identities and synteny with the S. suis genome. These data indicate a potential origin for this "ecological" island in a species closely related to S. suis. The analysis of the distribution of the prtS gene in S. thermophilus showed that the gene is infrequent in historical collections but frequent in recent industrial ones. Moreover, this "ecological" island conferring an important metabolic trait for milk adaptation appears to have disseminated by lateral transfer in the S. thermophilus population. Taken together, these data support an evolutionary scheme of S. thermophilus where gene acquisition and selection by food producers are determining factors. The source and impact of genes acquired by horizontal gene transfer on the physiology and safety of strains should be addressed.
TI  - Evolutionary relationships among salivarius streptococci as inferred from multilocus phylogenies based on 16S rRNA-encoding, recA, secA, and secY gene sequences.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococci are divided into six phylogenetic groups, i.e, anginosus, bovis, mitis, mutans, pyogenic, and salivarius, with the salivarius group consisting of only three distinct species. Two of these species, Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus vestibularis, are members of the normal human oral microflora whereas the third, Streptococcus thermophilus, is found in bovine milk. Given that S. salivarius and S. vestibularis share several physiological characteristics, in addition to inhabiting the same ecosystem, one would assume that they would be more closely related to each other than to S. thermophilus. However, the few phylogenetic trees published so far suggest that S. vestibularis is more closely related to S. thermophilus. To determine whether this phylogenetic relationship is genuine, we performed phylogenetic inferences derived from secA and secY, the general secretion housekeeping genes, recA, a gene from a separate genetic locus that encodes a major component of the homologous recombinational apparatus, and 16S rRNA-encoding gene sequences using other streptococcal species as outgroups. RESULTS: The maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum parsimony (MP) phylogenetic inferences derived from the secA and recA gene sequences provided strong support for the S. vestibularis/S. thermophilus sister-relationship, whereas 16S rRNA-encoding and secY-based analyses could not discriminate between alternate topologies. Phylogenetic analyses derived from the concatenation of these sequences unambiguously supported the close affiliation of S. vestibularis and S. thermophilus. CONCLUSION: Our results corroborated the sister-relationship between S. vestibularis and S. thermophilus and the concomitant early divergence of S. salivarius at the base of the salivarius lineage.
TI  - Pediocin production in milk by Pediococcus acidilactici in co-culture with Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus.
AB  - The production of pediocin in milk by Pediococcus acidilactici was evaluated in co-culture with the dairy fermentation cultures Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus. The cultures were tested singly and in different combinations in milk (0 or 2% fat content) during incubation at 40 degrees C for up to 10 h. Cell-free milk samples taken every 60 min were tested for bacteriocin activity against Listeria monocytogenes. Pediocin activity was not detectable when P. acidilactici was inoculated into milk as a monoculture. When P. acidilactici was grown in combination with the yogurt starter cultures S. thermophilus and Lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, pediocin concentration reached 3,200-6,400 units ml(-1) after 8 h of incubation. The results showed that pediocin producing pediococci may be useful adjunct components in mixed cultures of S. thermophilus and Lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus to amplify the bioprotective properties of fermented dairy foods against Listeria contamination.
TI  - Effect of probiotic supplementation on immunoglobulins, isoagglutinins and antibody response in children of low socio-economic status.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antigen exposure is one of the major exogenous factors modulating human immunocompetence acquisition. Decline in family size and improvements in public health and hygiene in developed countries, may deprive the immune system of appropriate antigen input by diminishing infectious stimuli. Probiotics are a large group of microorganisms defined by their beneficial effects on human health and with stimulating effects on different functions of the immune system. AIM OF THE STUDY: We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine if probiotics maintain their immune-stimulating effects in a population of 162 children with a high index of natural exposure to microorganisms. Children were to ingest for at least 4 months one of two products, low-fat milk fermented by Streptococcus thermophilus (control product) or low-fat milk fermented by S. thermophilus and Lactobacillus casei, with Lactobacillus acidophilus, oligofructose and inulin added after the fermentation process (test product). According to their age, children were vaccinated with DTP-Hib vaccine or a 23-valent anti-pneumococcal vaccine. RESULTS: Final analysis of results was done in 70 children in each group, showing that the rate of immunoglobulin and isoagglutinin acquisition was similar in both groups. There was no difference between groups in antibody levels neither before nor after vaccination. Days of fever and number of episodes of infection were not statistically different in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation of standard fermented milk with additional probiotics was not of benefit. The high natural rate of early microbial exposure in infants and children from a population of low socio-economic status living in a "less hygienic environment" may account for the absence of an additional immune-stimulating effect by supplementary probiotics.
TI  - Diversity and evolution of the microbial populations during manufacture and ripening of Casin, a traditional Spanish, starter-free cheese made from cow's milk.
AB  - Classical culturing and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) techniques have been used for studying the microbial diversity and dynamics of the traditional Spanish Casin cheese during manufacturing and ripening. As with other starter-free cheeses made from raw milk, the microbial diversity of Casin was shown to be high by both culturing and DGGE analyses. The culture technique showed that lactic acid bacteria (LAB) species constituted the majority of the microbial populations. Of the 14 bacterial species identified, Lactococcus garvieae was predominant in the three-day-old cheese sample, although it was replaced by Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis at day 30. As expected, the DGGE profiles obtained were complex, consisting, depending on the sample, in five to ten different amplification bands. Among these, a band corresponding to Streptococcus thermophilus was observed throughout the whole manufacturing process. This species had never been identified from traditional Spanish cheeses previously. Culturing and molecular methods showed high populations of undesirable microorganisms, arguing for a required improvement in the hygiene of Casin manufacture. Random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) profiling suggested that the L. garvieae and L. lactis populations were composed of one and five strains, respectively. In addition, only a single L. lactis RAPD pattern was stably maintained from day three to day 30, indicating high succession of strains along ripening. After a thoroughly characterisation, strains of the two Lactococcus species could be used in designing specific starter cultures for Casin. Additional species (such as Lactobacillus plantarum and Corynebacterium variabile) might be included as adjunct cultures.
TI  - Genome analysis of two virulent Streptococcus thermophilus phages isolated in Argentina.
AB  - Two Streptococcus thermophilus phages (ALQ13.2 and phiAbc2) were previously isolated from breakdowns of cheese manufacture in Argentina. Complete nucleotide sequence analysis indicated that both phages contained linear double-stranded DNA: 35,525 bp in length for the pac-type phage ALQ13.2 and 34,882 bp for the cos-type phage phiAbc2. Forty-four and 48 open reading frames (ORF) were identified for ALQ13.2 and phiAbc2, respectively. Comparative genomic analysis showed that these isolates shared many similarities with the eight previously studied cos- and pac-phages infecting different S. thermophilus strains. In particular, part of the phiAbc2 genome was highly similar to a region of phage 7201, which was thought to be unique to this latter phage. Protein analysis of the pac-phage ALQ13.2 using SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) identified three major proteins and seven minor proteins. Parallel structural proteome analysis of phiAbc2 revealed seven protein bands, two of which were related to major structural proteins, as expected for a cos-type phage. Similarities to other S. thermophilus phages suggest that the streptococcal phage diversity is not extensive in worldwide dairy factories possibly because related high-performing bacterial strains are used in starter cultures.
TI  - Genotypic characterization of non starter lactic acid bacteria involved in the ripening of artisanal Bitto PDO cheese.
AB  - Bitto of Valchiavenna, an artisanal Italian cheese produced without the addition  of any starter cultures, has been attributed a protected designation origin (PDO) cheese, but the strain composition of the natural microbial population colonizing this traditional dairy product is still unknown. To obtain preliminary information on the non starter lactic acid bacteria involved in its ripening, a total of 136 NSLAB isolates, randomly selected from MRS and M17 agar plates, were collected from three different cheese samples after 120 days of ripening. The new isolates were identified by combining PCR 16S-23S rDNA spacer analyses, partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing, species-specific probes and colony hybridization. Eighty-two isolates, representing 60% of the total strains selected, were homofermentative cocci: 83% of them were enterococci, with Enterococcus durans being the predominant species found. Pediococcus spp. were also isolated, together with strains of Streptococcus thermophilus. Within lactobacilli, 57% of the isolates were identified as Lactobacillus paracasei; Lact. curvatus, Lact. plantarum, Lact. fermentum, were present in a lower amount. The isolates were differentiated at strain-level by Rep-PCR analysis. This is the first effort to microbiological characterization of Valchiavenna's Bitto; the results suggest the possibility of preserving the wild bacterial population in order to protect the typical organoleptic characteristics of this traditional raw milk cheese and to select new strains for the dairy industry.
TI  - Immunomodulatory properties of fermented soy and dairy milks prepared with lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Fermented soy and dairy milk preparations provide a means for delivering lactic acid bacteria and their fermentation products into the diet. Our aims were to test immunomodulatory bioactivity of fermented soy beverage (SB) and dairy milk blend (MB) preparations on human intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) and to determine the impact of freezing medium on culture survival prior to bioactivity analyses. Fermented SB and MB were prepared using pure or mixed cultures of Streptococcus thermophilus ST5, Bifidobacterium longum R0175, and Lactobacillus helveticus R0052. Immunomodulatory bioactivity was assessed by testing selected SB and MB ferments on tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha)-treated IEC and measuring effects on Interleukin-8 (IL-8) production. Impact of timing of ferment administration relative to this pro-inflammatory challenge was investigated. The most pronounced reductions in IEC IL-8 production were observed when IEC were treated with either SB or MB ferment preparations prior to TNFalpha challenge. These results indicate that freezing-stable MB and SB ferments prepared with selected strains can modulate IEC IL-8 production in vitro, and suggest that yogurt-like fermented soy formulations could provide a functional food alternative to milk-based fermented products.
TI  - Analyzing and monitoring of phage-bacteria interaction using CE.
AB  - The utilization of CE for monitoring bacteria-phage interaction was investigated  in this study. Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus strains and their phages were used as model bacteria and phages for the purpose of validation in this study. CE with heterogeneous polymer polyethylene oxide was utilized for the separation of intact bacteria and investigation of phage-bacteria interaction. An intact phage detection was carried out with CZE by adding SDS in the running buffer. Calibration graphs of bacteria and phages were obtained with R(2) values of 0.963 and 0.937, respectively. S. thermophilus strain was infected with its virulent phage B3-X18 for investigation of phage-bacteria interaction. It was observed in capillary electropherogram that the culture was lysed depending on the multiplicity of infection value and it showed to be completely lysed when the multiplicity of infection value was 10. The interaction of S. thermophilus strain with L. bulgaricus phage was also investigated by using a CE and a microbiological method and it was observed that the L. bulgaricus phage attached itself to the cell wall of S. thermophilus strain without damaging the cell.
TI  - Heterologous expression of the Bacillus subtilis (natto) alanine dehydrogenase in Escherichia coli and Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - The major objective of the present study is to change the alanine production of Lactic acid bacteria by expression of Bacillus subtilis (natto) alanine dehydrogenase (AlaDH), the gene that is not present in Lactic acid. B. subtilis AlaDH gene (ald) was cloned into a pGEX6p-1 and expressed in E. coli JM109. Its enzyme activity was 48.3U/mg at 30 degrees C and 45.2U/mg at 42 degrees C. This ald gene was then cloned into a vector pNZ8148 to generate a vector pNZ8148/ald. The same ald gene was placed downstream of the ldh promoter from Streptococcus thermophilus to generate pNZ273/ldhp/ald. The pNZ8148/ald and pNZ273/ldhp/ald were introduced separately in Lactococcus lactis NZ9000. As a result of over-expressed ald, the production of alanine detected by HPLC in L. lactis NZ9000 carrying pNZ273/ldhp/ald reached 52mug/ml, an approximately 26-fold increase compared to the parent strain L. lactis NZ9000, but not in L. lactis NZ9000 carrying pNZ8148/ald. This study would help strain improvement to be used in dairy fermentation for developing healthy yogurts with sweet taste or other fermented dairy foods.
TI  - [Identification, quantification and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of probiotic bacteria added to common use food products in Costa Rica].
AB  - In the last years, due to the high demand of food products supplemented with probiotics and the multiple nutritional and therapeutic benefits associated with them, research on these microorganisms has advanced considerably, including their selection and characterization. As a general recommendation, several entities as World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Organization for Agriculture and Food recommend that the specification of the alive species contained and their number shall appear in the label of the product. In the present study, six different commercially available products, supplemented with probiotics were analyzed, in order to evaluate the concentration of microorganisms through the shelf life of the product, identify the strains isolated and determine the antibiotic susceptibility pattern of these. Results demonstrated that the strains isolated kept acceptable concentrations during the 28 days of storage. Nevertheless, the identification of these strains variated from the one reported on the label on several of the products tested. This can be due to the commercial method used for the identifications, which is based in the carbohydrate fermentation pattern and not in genotypic trials. The antimicrobials' susceptibility patterns found show that further research shall be performed in order to establish the intrinsic or acquired nature of the resistance determinants, and if these are codified by transferable elements among bacteria.
TI  - CRISPR analysis of bacteriophage-insensitive mutants (BIMs) of industrial Streptococcus thermophilus--implications for starter design.
AB  - AIMS: An efficient approach for generation of bacteriophage-insensitive mutants (BIMs) of Streptococcus thermophilus starters was described in our laboratory [Mills et al. (2007) J Microbiol Methods70, 159-164]. The aim of this study was to analyse the phage resistance mechanism responsible for BIM formation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) regions have been identified in Strep. thermophilus, and Strep. thermophilus can integrate novel spacers into these loci in response to phage attack. Characterization of three sets of BIMs indicated that two sets had altered CRISPR1 and/or CRISPR3 loci. A range of BIMs of yoghurt starter CSK938 were generated with the same phage in different phage challenge experiments, and each acquired unique spacer regions ranging between one and four new spacers in CRISPR1. In addition, the BIM that acquired only one new spacer in CRISPR1 also acquired an additional spacer in CRISPR3. A fourth BIM, generated with a different phage, had two spacers deleted from CRISPR1 but acquired two spacers in CRISPR3. Analysis of the Mozzarella starter CSK939 and its associated BIMs indicated that formation of second generation BIMs does not lead to increases in spacer number but to alterations in spacer regions. BIMs of an exopolysaccharide (EPS)-producing strain that lost the ability to produce EPS did not harbour an altered CRISPR, suggesting that phage sensitivity may be related to the EPS-producing phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: Acquisition/deletion of new spacers in CRISPR loci in response to phage attack generates distinctly individual variants. It also demonstrates that other modifications may be responsible for the phage resistance of Strep. thermophilus BIMs. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Isolation of individual BIMs that have unique spacers towards the leader region of the CRISPR locus may be a very useful approach for rotation strategies with the same starter backbone. Upon phage infection, BIMs 'in reserve' can be slotted into the rotation scheme.
TI  - Identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Tarhana, a traditional Turkish fermented food.
AB  - Tarhana is a traditional fermented product produced from a mixture of spontaneously fermented yogurt and wheat flour in Turkey. The aims of the present study were to enumerate and identify for the first time by molecular biology-based methods predominant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated during processing of Tarhana. Samples were collected from eight different regions of Turkey. In order to explore the relationship between raw material and the microbiology of Tarhana, yogurt and wheat flour were also analyzed. A total of 226 Gram-positive and catalase-negative isolates were obtained from MRS, M17 and SBM (Slanetz and Bartley Medium). The isolates were grouped and identified using a combination of pheno- and genotypic methods including rep-PCR fingerprinting [(GTG)(5) primer], multiplex PCR, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and carbohydrate assimilation profiling. Pediococcus acidilactici were found to constitute 27% of the isolates, 19% were identified as Streptococcus thermophilus, 19% as Lactobacillus fermentum, 12% as Enterococcus faecium, 7% as Pediococcus pentosaceus, 5% as Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, 4% as Weissella cibaria, 2% as Lactobacillus plantarum, 2% as Lactobacillus delbrueckii spp. bulgaricus, 2% as Leuconostoc citreum, 1% as Lactobacillus paraplantarum and 0.5% as Lactobacillus casei. The different production sites investigated all had individual LAB profiles, but with P. acidilactici and S. thermophilus being isolated from the majority of samples. The main source of P. acidilactici and S. thermophilus was found to be the yogurt.
TI  - Cloning and expression of glutamate decarboxylase gene from Streptococcus thermophilus Y2.
AB  
TI  - Production of exopolysaccharides by Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains of  human origin, and metabolic activity of the producing bacteria in milk.
AB  - This work reports on the physicochemical characterization of 21 exopolysaccharides (EPS) produced by Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains isolated from human intestinal microbiota, as well as the growth and metabolic activity of the EPS-producing strains in milk. The strains belong to the species Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus vaginalis, Bifidobacterium animalis, Bifidobacterium longum, and Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum. The molar mass distribution of EPS fractions showed 2 peaks of different sizes, which is a feature shared with some EPS from bacteria of food origin. In general, we detected an association between the EPS size distribution and the EPS-producing species, although because of the low numbers of human bacterial EPS tested, we could not conclusively establish a correlation. The main monosaccharide components of the EPS under study were glucose, galactose, and rhamnose, which are the same as those found in food polymers; however, the rhamnose and glucose ratios was generally higher than the galactose ratio in our human bacterial EPS. All EPS-producing strains were able to grow and acidify milk; most lactobacilli produced lactic acid as the main metabolite. The lactic acid-to-acetic acid ratio in bifidobacteria was 0.7, close to the theoretical ratio, indicating that the EPS-producing strains did not produce an excessive amount of acetic acid, which could adversely affect the sensory properties of fermented milks. With respect to their viscosity-intensifying ability, L. plantarum H2 and L. rhamnosus E41 and E43R were able to increase the viscosity of stirred, fermented milks to a similar extent as the EPS-producing Streptococcus thermophilus strain used as a positive control. Therefore, these human EPS-producing bacteria could be used as adjuncts in mixed cultures for the formulation of functional foods if probiotic characteristics could be demonstrated. This is the first article reporting the physicochemical characteristics of EPS isolated from human intestinal microbiota.
TI  - A method for manufacturing superior set yogurt under reduced oxygen conditions.
AB  - The yogurt starters Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus are well-known facultatively anaerobic bacteria that can grow in oxygenated environments. We found that they removed dissolved oxygen (DO) in a yogurt mix as the fermentation progressed and that they began to produce acid actively after the DO concentration in the yogurt mix was reduced to 0 mg/kg, suggesting that the DO retarded the production of acid. Yogurt fermentation was carried out at 43 or 37 degrees C both after the DO reduction treatment and without prior treatment. Nitrogen gas was mixed and dispersed into the yogurt mix after inoculation with yogurt starter culture to reduce the DO concentration in the yogurt mix. The treatment that reduced DO concentration in the yogurt mix to approximately 0 mg/kg beforehand caused the starter culture LB81 used in this study to enter into the exponential growth phase earlier. Furthermore, the combination of reduced DO concentration in the yogurt mix beforehand and incubation at a lower temperature (37 degrees C) resulted in a superior set yogurt with a smooth texture and strong curd structure.
TI  - Enhancement of survival of probiotic and non-probiotic lactic acid bacteria by yeasts in fermented milk under non-refrigerated conditions.
AB  - The effects of yeasts on the survival of probiotic and non-probiotic lactic acid  bacteria (LAB) were studied in fermented milk under non-refrigerated conditions (30 degrees C) with a view to develop ambient-stable fermented milk with live LAB. Five yeasts tested (Saccharomyces bayanus, Williopsis saturnus var. saturnus, Yarrowia lipolytica, Candida kefyr and Kluyveromyces marxianus) enhanced the survival of Lactobacillus bulgaricus (but not Streptococcus thermophilus) in a mixed yoghurt culture in yoghurt by approximately 10(2) to 10(5)-fold. Seven yeasts examined (Candida krusei, Geotrichum candidum, Pichia subpelliculosa, Kloeckera apiculata, Pichia membranifaciens, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Y. lipolytica) improved the survival of Lactobacillus rhamnosus in fermented milk by approximately10(3) to 10(6)-fold. W. saturnus var. saturnus enhanced the survival of Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. rhamnosus (probiotic) and Lactobacillus reuteri by up to 10(6)-fold, but the same yeast failed to improve the survival of Lactobacillus johnsonii (probiotic), S. thermophilus and L. bulgaricus in fermented milk. These results provide definitive evidence that yeasts possess stability-enhancing effects on LAB and that the specific effects of yeasts on LAB stability vary with yeasts as well as with LAB. However, the molecular mechanism of such interaction of yeasts with LAB remains to be found.
TI  - Dynamics of fecal microbiota in hospitalized elderly fed probiotic LKM512 yogurt.
AB  - The comprehensive dynamics of intestinal microbiota including uncultured bacteria in response to probiotic consumption have not been well studied. The aims of this study were twofold: firstly to analyze the impact on intestinal microbiota of yogurt fermented by Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis LKM512, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus LKM1759, and Streptococcus thermophilus LKM1742 (LKM512 yogurt) and placebo fermented by these lactic acid bacterial strains without LKM512; and secondly to investigate the changes in intestinal microbiota that influence the concentration of PA, one of the beneficial metabolites produced by bacteria in the intestine. The LKM512 yogurt/placebo trial was performed in six hospitalized elderly patients (three men and three women with an average age of 80.3 years) and lasted seven weeks with the following schedule: pre-consumption for one week, LKM512 yogurt consumption for two weeks, washout period for two weeks, and placebo consumption for two weeks. The amount of ingested LKM512 yogurt or placebo was 100 g/day/individual. Fecal samples were analyzed using T-RFLP and real-time PCR. The T-RFLP patterns in five of the six volunteers were changed in a similar fashion by LKM512 yogurt consumption, although these patterns were individually changed following consumption of placebo. It was confirmed that B. animalis subsp. lactis was increased dramatically and Lactobacillus spp. tended to be decreased by LKM512 yogurt consumption. Some indigenous uncultured bacteria were increased and some decreased by LKM512 yogurt/placebo consumption. The similar changes in the intestinal microbiota of the elderly caused by consumption of the LKM512 yogurt were found to be influenced by the LKM512 strain itself, and not by the lactic acid bacteria in the yogurt. Moreover, this study suggests that the increase in intestinal PA concentrations caused by LKM512 yogurt consumption is probably dependent on the LKM512 strain colonizing the intestine.
TI  - Application of AFLP fingerprint analysis for studying the biodiversity of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus is a lactic acid bacteria (LAB) widely used in milk fermentation processes as a starter culture. In this work the genetic diversity of S. thermophilus isolates from different sources was analyzed using Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism fingerprinting (AFLP). Since this is the first report that indicates the application of AFLP in order to study genotypic polymorphism in S. thermophilus species, an optimization of experimental conditions was carried out to decide the optimal AFLP analysis protocol. Furthermore the fingerprinting resolutions of AFLP and RAPD (Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA) were evaluated and compared. The overall data suggest that genotypic characterization performed by AFLP provide a better view of microbial diversity of S. thermophilus, indicating that RAPD is less discriminating than AFLP. The successful use of AFLP analysis in the characterization of S. thermophilus strains reported in this study suggests the potential uses for this technique to define the whole-genome diversity of each specific strain, as an alternative to the fingerprinting methods used till now.
TI  - Balancing inflammatory, lipid, and xenobiotic signaling pathways by VSL#3, a biotherapeutic agent, in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The interleukin 10 knockout mouse (IL10-KO) is a model of human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) used to study host microbial interactions and the action of potential therapeutics. Using Affymetrix data analysis, important signaling pathways and transcription factors relevant to gut inflammation and antiinflammatory probiotics were identified. METHODS: Affymetrix microarray analysis on both wildtype (WT) and IL10-KO mice orally administered with and without the probiotic VSL#3 was performed and the results validated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunocytochemistry, proteomics, and histopathology. Changes in metabolically active bacteria were assessed with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). RESULTS: Inflammation in IL10-KO mice was characterized by differential regulation of inflammatory, nuclear receptor, lipid, and xenobiotic signaling pathways. Probiotic intervention resulted in downregulation of CXCL9 (fold change [FC] = -3.98, false discovery rate [FDR] = 0.019), CXCL10 (FC = -4.83, FDR = 0.0008), CCL5 (FC = -3.47, FDR = 0.017), T-cell activation (Itgal [FC = -4.72, FDR = 0.00009], Itgae [FC = -2.54 FDR = 0.0044]) and the autophagy gene IRGM (FC = -1.94, FDR = 0.01), a recently identified susceptibility gene in human IBD. Consistent with a marked reduction in integrins, probiotic treatment decreased the number of CCL5+ CD3+ double-positive T cells and upregulated galectin2, which triggers apoptosis of activated T cells. Importantly, genes associated with lipid and PPAR signaling (PPARalpha [FC = 2.36, FDR = 0.043], PPARGC1alpha [FC = 2.58, FDR = 0.016], Nr1d2 [FC = 3.11, FDR = 0.0067]) were also upregulated. Altered microbial diversity was noted in probiotic-treated mice. CONCLUSIONS: Bioinformatics analysis revealed important immune response, phagocytic and inflammatory pathways dominated by elevation of T-helper cell 1 type (TH1) transcription factors in IL10-KO mice. Probiotic intervention resulted in a site-specific reduction of these pathways but importantly upregulated PPAR, xenobiotic, and lipid signaling genes, potential antagonists of NF-kappaB inflammatory pathways.
TI  - Improvement of constipation and liver function by plant-derived lactic acid bacteria: a double-blind, randomized trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) contribute to human health; however, the probiotic properties vary among strains classified into the same species. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of yogurts made by different types of LAB on the gastrointestinal system. The yogurts were also evaluated by measuring serum lipid contents and liver functional indicators as a secondary objective. METHODS: Healthy human adults (n = 68) with some complaints with regard to intestinal health, including constipation and diarrhea, were randomly assigned to receive one of three types of yogurt in a double-blind manner: type A, a yogurt made by plant-derived LAB (mainly Lactobacillus [Lb.] plantarum SN35N); type B, a yogurt made by plant-derived LAB (mainly Lb. plantarum SN13T); and type C, a yogurt made by animal-derived LAB (mainly Lactococcus lactis A6 and Streptococcus thermophilus 510) as a control. The subjects consumed 100 g of yogurt daily for 6 wk. Data were collected from clinical visits at 2-wk intervals and by diaries used to record defecation and health conditions. RESULTS: Drastic and constant increments of defecation frequency in subjects with constipation were observed with type A and B yogurts but not with type C yogurt. Type B and C yogurts resulted in decreases in total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The serum concentrations of liver functional parameters were improved by the type B yogurt (12-25% reduction). CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that Lb. plantarum SN13T exhibits a superior probiotic effect on constipation in addition to improving the serum lipid contents and liver function.
TI  - Degradation of milk-based bioactive peptides by yogurt fermentation bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: To analyse the effect of cell-associated peptidases in yogurt starter culture strains Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (LB) and Streptococcus thermophilus (ST) on milk-protein-based antimicrobial and hypotensive peptides in order to determine their survival in yogurt-type dairy foods. METHODS AND RESULTS: The 11mer antimicrobial and 12mer hypotensive milk-protein-derived peptides were incubated with mid-log cells of LB and ST, which are required for yogurt production. Incubations were performed at pH 4.5 and 7.0, and samples removed at various time points were analysed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The peptides remained mostly intact at pH 4.5 in the presence of ST strains and moderately digested by exposure to LB cells. Peptide loss occurred more rapidly and was more extensive after incubation at pH 7.0. CONCLUSIONS: The 11mer and 12mer bioactive peptides may be added at the end of the yogurt-making process when the pH level has dropped to 4.5, limiting the overall extent of proteolysis. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results show the feasibility of using milk-protein-based antimicrobial and hypotensive peptides as food supplements to improve the health-promoting qualities of liquid and semi-solid dairy foods prepared by the yogurt fermentation process.
TI  - The role of aminopeptidase PepS in the growth of Streptococcus thermophilus is not restricted to nitrogen nutrition.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the effect of an absence of aminopeptidase PepS on the growth of Streptococcus thermophilus on different media and at different temperatures. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using gene interruption, a negative mutant of the Strep. thermophilus CNRZ385 strain was constructed for the aminopeptidase PepS (strain DeltapepS). Checks were first of all made using biochemical assays that the DeltapepS strain lacks the peptide hydrolase activity of aminopeptidase PepS. It was demonstrated that the absence of the aminopeptidase PepS exerted a negative effect on growth whatever the culture medium (M17, chemically defined medium, milk). The role of aminopeptidase PepS in growth was enhanced at a high temperature (45 degrees C vs 37 degrees C). The DeltapepS strain was more resistant to lysozyme than the wild-type strain. CONCLUSIONS: We were able to demonstrate that aminopeptidase PepS probably plays a pleiotropic role through its involvement in growth via nitrogen nutrition, as well as via other cellular functions/metabolisms (such as peptidoglycane metabolism). SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study constitutes the first report on the role of a member of the M29 MEROPS family of metallopeptidases (http://merops.sanger.ac.uk/).
TI  - Possible promoter regions within the proteolytic system in Streptococcus thermophilus and their interaction with the CodY homolog.
AB  - Possible promoter regions preceding 14 genes belonging to the proteolytic system  of Streptococcus thermophilus KLDS 3.0503 were predicted by a promoter analysis software nnpp. The 14 genes included an extracellular protease gene prtS, an oligopeptide ABC transport system gene amiA1, and 12 genes, respectively, encoding peptidases pepA, pepS, pepN, pepC, pepB, pepQ, pepV, pepT, pepM, pepXP, pepP, and pepO. These predicted promoter sequences were cloned and inserted into the upstream of a promoterless Escherichia coli gusA (beta-glucuronidase) gene in a promoter probe vector pNZ273. The resulting vectors were, respectively, introduced into S. thermophilus KLDS 3.0503 and all 14 predicted promoter sequences were able to drive gusA expression, which indicated that these sequences were functional promoters. These promoters were able to interact with the S. thermophilus CodY homolog in an in vitro DNA binding assay but they did not contain a conserved CodY-box sequence identified in Lactococcus lactis. These results were useful for further studies on the regulation of protein metabolism in S. thermophilus.
TI  - Bacterial diversity of Darfiyeh, a Lebanese artisanal raw goat's milk cheese.
AB  - In order to contribute to the preservation of the Lebanese dairy heritage, the aim of this study was to characterize the Darfiyeh cheese, a traditional variety made from raw goat's milk and ripened in goat's skin. Three independent batches of Darfiyeh production were analyzed after 20, 40 and 60 days of ripening. Mesophilic lactobacilli, thermophilic coccal-shaped lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and thermophilic lactobacilli were enumerated. In order to explore the Darfiyeh natural ecosystem, a combination of phenotypical and molecular approaches was applied. The latter included Polymerase Chain Reaction-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (PCR-TTGE), classical PCR and quantitative PCR. These methods revealed the presence of Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus malodoratus, group D Streptococcus sp., Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and L. lactis subsp. cremoris, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus curvatus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Escherichia coli, Clostridium sp./Eubacterium tenue. Real-time PCR enabled quantification of E. faecium, with a detection of 10(7)-10(9) cfu g(-1) of product. The present molecular approaches combined with phenotypic method allowed describing the complex natural ecosystem of Darfiyeh, giving useful information for the preservation of Lebanese artisanal dairy products.
TI  - Fermented goats' milk produced with selected multiple starters as a potentially functional food.
AB  - A screening among five lactic acid bacteria, used alone or in combination, led to select a mixed starter (Streptococcus thermophilus CR12, Lactobacillus casei LC01, Lactobacillus helveticus PR4, Lactobacillus plantarum 1288) capable to produce a fermented goats' milk containing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory peptides. The fermented milk was characterized by cell counts of lactic acid bacteria not lower than 7.0 log cfu g(-1), even after 45 days of storage at 4 degrees C. Fermentation of goats' milk resulted in the production of ca. 28 mg kg(-1) of GABA. Furthermore the fermented goats' milk had an in vitro ACE-inhibitory activity of ca. 73%. Prolonged cold storage did not significantly affect both the concentration of GABA and the ACE-inhibitory activity. Moreover, the taurine content did not significantly vary during both fermentation and the entire storage period.
TI  - Prevention of TNBS-induced colitis by different Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains is associated with an expansion of gammadeltaT and regulatory T cells of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics may protect against inflammatory bowel disease through regulation of lamina propria lymphocytes (LPLs) function. Data are lacking on possible involvement of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs). The aim of this study was to investigate whether different probiotic mixtures prevented gut inflammatory disease and the role of both IELs and LPLs. METHODS: BALB/c mice received 2 probiotic mixtures orally for 3 weeks, as Mix1 (Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium longum), or Mix2 (Lactobacillus plantarum, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis). Colitis was induced by intrarectal administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS). Probiotics in stools were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Colon subpopulations of IELs and LPLs were assayed by flow cytometry. Serum cytokines were measured by cytometric bead array (CBA). RESULTS: All probiotics colonized the intestine. The 2 mixtures prevented the TNBS-induced intestinal damage, and Mix1 was the most effective. The Mix1 protection was associated with a reduction in CD4(+) cells of IELs and LPLs, an increase in gammadeltaT cells of IELs, and a decrease in gammadeltaT cells of LPLs. An expansion of T regulatory (Treg) cells of IELs was induced by Mix1 and Mix2. Both probiotic mixtures inhibited tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 production and upregulated interleukin (IL)-10. In addition, Mix1 prevented the TNBS-induced increase of IL-12 and interferon (IFN)-gamma. CONCLUSIONS: The 2 probiotic mixtures were able to prevent the TNBS-induced colitis; the L. acidophilus and B. longum mixture was the most effective. Other than an involvement of LPLs, our results report a novel importance of the IELs population in probiotic protection.
TI  - Performance of starter in yogurt supplemented with soy protein isolate and biotransformation of isoflavones during storage period.
AB  - In this study, soy protein isolate (SPI) (4%, v/w) was supplemented to the yogurt mix to increase the amount of biologically active isoflavone in yogurt (SY). The control yogurt was without any SPI supplementation (USY). The supplementation significantly (P < 0.05) increased the lactose metabolism by the yogurt starter including Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus ATCC 11842 (Lb 11842) and Streptococcus thermophilus ST 1342 (ST 1342) during the fermentation process by 4.7%. The starter produced more acetic acid and less lactic acid in SY than that in USY and altered the ratio of lactic and acetic acid during the entire storage period. The viability of both Lb 11842 and ST 1342 in SY was significantly (P < 0.05) lower than that in USY from 14 d of the storage period, however, their concentration still remained high (8.11 to 8.84 log CFU/g). The starter transformed 72.8% of total inactive isoflavone glycosides (IG) to active isoflavone aglycones (IA), increasing the IA content from 1.35 to 15.01 mg/100 g sample. During the storage period, IA concentration slowly rose from 15.02 to 15.51 mg/100 g sample.
TI  - Transcriptional analysis of the gdhA gene in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - AIMS: To study the transcriptional analysis of glutamate dehydrogenase gene, involved in the amino acid conversion to aroma compound in Streptococcus thermophilus. METHODS AND RESULTS: Analysis of the gdhA gene nucleotide sequence of S. thermophilus CNRZ1066 revealed that the coding region is 1353 nucleotides long. The deduced amino acids sequence exhibits the putative GDH active site and some conserved domains characteristic of family I of hexameric GDHs. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the gdh gene of S. thermophilus clustered with the orthologues of other streptococci such as Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus infantarius. Studying the structural organization of the gdhA locus the amino acid similarity of GDHs was higher than 87%, but the locus organization was not conserved. A dominant transcript of approximately 1.4 kbp was revealed by Northern blot hybridization, suggesting that gdhA mRNA is monocystronic. Primer extension showed that transcription start point of gdhA was localized 43 bp upstream of the potential start codon (ATG). CONCLUSIONS: The gdhA represents a monocistronic operon highly conserved in phylogenetic-related bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: A deeper knowledge of gdh transcriptional mechanisms could lead to develop S. thermophilus industrial starter cultures with optimized aromatic properties.
TI  - Characterisation of thermotolerant cocci from indigenous flora of 'leben' in algerian arid area and DNA identification of atypical Lactococcus lactis strains.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are widely used in food industry and their growth performance is important for the quality of the fermented product. By combining results from conventional isolation methods and molecular investigation of 16S rRNA gene and lactococcal/enterococcal specific genes, we identify at species level catalase negative gram positive thermoresistant cocci isolated from traditional 'leben', a 24-h fermented milk in arid area of west Algeria. Forty strains phenotypically related to cocci LAB were identified as belonging to the species Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and other Enterococcus species. No Streptococcus thermophilus strain was isolated. Ten different phenotype groups were recognized, and the species content of these groups were in some cases different from the expected features usually given in genus and species descriptions. In particular, atypical lactococci, able to grow in 6.5% NaCl, at pH 9.5 and showing high resistance to thermal stresses were isolated. Lactococci, but also enterococci isolated from traditional 'leben' produced in the desert area, may be therefore of interest in milk fermentation. Further studies to assess this source of diversity within the wild microbial population should provide starter new strains for product innovation.
TI  - A DNA array based assay for the characterization of microbial community in raw milk.
AB  - An oligonucleotide array based on PCR method containing a combination of probes for taxonomic markers and species-specific virulence genes was developed for the simultaneous identification of 14 Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) and food-borne pathogenic bacteria in raw milk. The hypervariable regions V3 and V6 of 16S, together with a variable region of 23S rRNA genes and several genes specific for virulence factors were selected. Universal primers and multiplex PCR were used for the rapid differentiation of bacterial species and low concentration of specific pathogenic and spoilage bacteria were detected in milk. The dominant species such as Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactococcus lactis, andLeuconostoc lactis were identified by indirect-labelling reactions based upon incorporation of amino-allyl dUTPs. The results regarding food-borne pathogens detection showed highly specific hybridisation patterns with the genomic DNA from Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, Salmonella thyphimurium, Listeria monocytogenes and Yersinia enterocolitica. A clear differentiation of dominant species present in a complex microbial community such as raw milk was achieved by the application of short oligonucleotide probes which discriminate sequences differing by few nucleotides.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a strain-dependent cystathionine beta/gamma-lyase in Lactobacillus casei potentially involved in cysteine biosynthesis.
AB  - The trans-sulfuration pathways allow the interconversion of cysteine and methionine with the intermediary formation of cystathionine and homocysteine. The genome database of Lactobacillus casei ATCC 334 provides evidence that this species cannot synthesize cysteine from methionine via the trans-sulfuration pathway. However, several L. casei strains use methionine as the sole sulfur source, which implies that these strains can convert methionine to cysteine. Cystathionine synthases and lyases play a crucial role in the trans-sulfuration pathway. By applying proteomic techniques, we have identified a protein in cell-free extracts of L. casei, which showed high homology to a gene product encoded in the genome of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus helveticus but not in the genome of L. casei ATCC 334. The presence of the gene was only found in strains able to grow on methionine as the sole sulfur source. Moreover, two gene variants were identified. Both gene variants were cloned and expressed heterologously in Escherichia coli. The recombinant enzymes exhibited cystathionine lyase activity in vitro and also cleaved cysteine, homocysteine and methionine releasing volatile sulfur compounds.
TI  - Effect of exopolysaccharides on the hydrolysis of beta-lactoglobulin by Lactobacillus acidophilus CRL 636 in an in vitro gastric/pancreatic system.
AB  - An analysis of the peptides generated by hydrolysis of BLG by nonproliferating cells of the strain Lactobacillus acidophilus CRL 636 was carried out. The effect of polysaccharides (pectin, and two EPS synthesized by two Streptococcus thermophilus strains, EPS1190 and EPS804) on BLG digestibility using an in vitro gastric/pancreatic system was analyzed. Polysaccharides are commonly used in the dairy industry to improve food texture; these hydrocolloids may interact with proteins, affecting their digestibility. Nonproliferating cells of Lb. acidophilus CRL 636 were able to hydrolyze 52% of BLG. Twenty-six resulting peptides with molecular masses in the range 544-4119 Da were identified by LC-MS/MS. These peptides resulted mostly from the hydrolysis of the more accessible N-terminal part of BLG. Degradation of BLG by pepsin was poor (8%). When BLG was previously hydrolyzed by Lb. acidophilus CRL 636, peptic hydrolysis was of 54.8%, while when pectin and EPS1190 were added, hydrolysis was higher (58.2 and 57.2%, respectively). Peptides crossing 8 kDa dialysis membranes after trypsin/chymotrypsin hydrolysis were analyzed by HPSEC. The produced peptides were smaller when BLG was hydrolyzed previously by the Lb. acidophilus strain. Moreover, in the presence of pectin, the amount of the larger peptide (3.5 kDa) observed in the size exclusion chromatograms was considerably decreased. Our studies showed that prehydrolysis of BLG by Lb. acidophilus CRL 636 had a positive influence on BLG digestibility and that polysaccharides may change the peptide profile yielded by trypsin/chymotrypsin hydrolysis, releasing smaller size peptides, which are known to be less immune-reactive. Moreover, Lb. acidophilus CRL 636 was able to hydrolyze the main epitopes (41-60, 102-124, and 149-162) of BLG, reducing its allergenic content.
TI  - Evidence for probiotic potential of a capsular-producing Streptococcus thermophilus CHCC 3534 strain.
AB  - The purpose of this research was to evaluate the probiotic potential of an capsulated Streptococcus thermophilus CHCC 3534 strain. The strain tolerates 0.4% oxgall (bile) and was sufficiently resistant to pH as low as 2.5 for 3 hours of exposure. The strain demonstrated high adherence to human intestinal mucus, and showed unique resistance to different antibiotics. Crude extracts ofS. thermophilus CHCC 3534 contained a diffusible antimicrobial compound "bacteriocin" with a broad spectrum that inhibited the growth of closely related lactic acid bacteria and a number of food spoilage bacteria including Salmonella typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus. The bacteriocin was heat stable, resistant to pH, inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, and resistant to a-amylase and lipase. A SDS-PAGE analysis of the partially purified bacteriocin revealed one component with a molecular weight ranging from 14.4 to 18.4 kDa. The strain may have industrial significance and represents an interesting candidate for use in biopreservation, probiotic food formulations and in the control of spoilage caused by food borne pathogens.
TI  - Analysis of CRISPR system function in plant pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae.
AB  - Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) is a bacterial  immunity system that requires a perfect sequence match between the CRISPR cassette spacer and a protospacer in invading DNA for exclusion of foreign genetic elements. CRISPR cassettes are hypervariable, possibly reflecting different exposure of strains of the same species to foreign genetic elements. Here, we determined CRISPR cassette sequences of two Xanthomonas oryzae strains and found that one of the strains remains sensitive to phage Xop411 despite carrying a cassette that has a spacer exactly matching a fragment of the Xop411 genome. To explain this apparent paradox, we identified X. oryzae CRISPR spacers of likely phage origin and defined a consensus sequence of a motif adjacent to X. oryzae phage protospacers. Our analysis revealed that the Xop411 protospacer that matches the CRISPR spacer has this motif mutated, which likely explains the phage's ability to infect its host. While similar observations were made previously with Streptococcus thermophilus and its phages, the conserved motif in X. oryzae phages is located on a protospacer side opposite to the S. thermophilus phages' motif. The results thus point to a considerable degree of variety of CRISPR-mediated phage resistance mechanisms in different bacteria.
TI  - Prevention of chronic gastritis by fermented milks made with exopolysaccharide-producing Streptococcus thermophilus strains.
AB  - Acetyl-salicylic acid (ASA) is a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory/analgesic drug, which may cause gastritis or stomach ulcers if intensively employed. Exopolysaccharide (EPS)-producing lactic acid bacteria have been claimed to induce immunostimulatory/antiulcer effects in the host. This study investigated the potential preventive effect of fermented milks (FM) with EPS-producing Streptococcus thermophilus strains (CRL 1190 and CRL 804) on an in vivo model of chronic gastritis. Fermented milks (2 EPS(+) and 1 EPS(-), separately) were fed to BALB/c mice for 7 d before inducing gastritis with ASA (400 mg/kg of body weight per day for 10 d; gastritis group, n = 5). Appropriate control groups (ASA administered but not given FM, n = 5; and ASA not administered but given FM) were included in this study. Gastric inflammatory activity was evaluated through the stomach's histology and the number of IFNgamma(+) and IL-10(+) cytokine-producing cells in the gastric mucosa. Only mice preventively treated with the EPS-producing Strep. thermophilus CRL 1190 FM and later administered ASA did not develop gastritis, showing a conserved gastric mucosa structure similar to those of healthy mice. A marked decrease of IFNgamma(+)- and increase of IL-10(+)-producing cells compared with the gastritis group mice were observed. Purified EPS from Strep. thermophilus CRL 1190 resuspended in autoclaved milk was also effective for gastritis prevention. The EPS-protein interaction might be responsible for the observed gastroprotective effect; such interactions may be affected by industrial manufacturing conditions. The results indicate that the FM with Strep. thermophilus CRL 1190 or its EPS could be used in novel functional foods for preventing chronic gastritis.
TI  - The oligopeptide transport system is essential for the development of natural competence in Streptococcus thermophilus strain LMD-9.
AB  - In gram-positive bacteria, oligopeptide transport systems, called Opp or Ami, play a role in nutrition but are also involved in the internalization of signaling peptides that take part in the functioning of quorum-sensing pathways. Our objective was to reveal functions that are controlled by Ami via quorum-sensing mechanisms in Streptococcus thermophilus, a nonpathogenic bacterium widely used in dairy technology in association with other bacteria. Using a label-free proteomic approach combining one-dimensional electrophoresis with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, we compared the proteome of the S. thermophilus LMD-9 to that of a mutant deleted for the subunits C, D, and E of the ami operon. Both strains were grown in a chemically defined medium (CDM) without peptides. We focused our attention on proteins that were no more detected in the ami deletion mutant. In addition to the three subunits of the Ami transporter, 17 proteins fulfilled this criterion and, among them, 7 were similar to proteins that have been identified as essential for transformation in S. pneumoniae. These results led us to find a condition of growth, the early exponential state in CDM, that allows natural transformation in S. thermophilus LMD-9 to turn on spontaneously. Cells were not competent in M17 rich medium. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the Ami transporter controls the triggering of the competence state through the control of the transcription of comX, itself controlling the transcription of late competence genes. We also showed that one of the two oligopeptide-binding proteins of strain LMD-9 plays the predominant role in the control of competence.
TI  - Genome analysis of food grade lactic Acid-producing bacteria: from basics to applications.
AB  - Whole-genome sequencing has revolutionized and accelerated scientific research that aims to study the genetics, biochemistry and molecular biology of bacteria. Lactic acid-producing bacteria, which include lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and bifidobacteria, are typically Gram-positive, catalase-negative organisms, which occupy a wide range of natural plant- and animal-associated environments. LAB species are frequently involved in the transformation of perishable raw materials into more stable, pleasant, palatable and safe fermented food products. LAB and bifidobacteria are also found among the resident microbiota of the gastrointestinal and/or genitourinary tracts of vertebrates, where they are believed to exert health-promoting effects. At present, the genomes of more than 20 LAB and bifidobacterial species have been completely sequenced. Their genome content reflects its specific metabolism, physiology, biosynthetic capabilities, and adaptability to varying conditions and environments. The typical LAB/bifidobacterial genome is relatively small (from 1.7 to 3.3 Mb) and thus harbors a limited assortment of genes (from around 1,600 to over 3,000). These small genomes code for a broad array of transporters for efficient carbon and nitrogen assimilation from the nutritionally-rich niches they usually inhabit, and specify a rather limited range of biosynthetic and degrading capabilities. The variation in the number of genes suggests that the genome evolution of each of these bacterial groups involved the processes of extensive gene loss from their particular ancestor, diversification of certain common biological activities through gene duplication, and acquisition of key functions via horizontal gene transfer. The availability of genome sequences is expected to revolutionize the exploitation of the metabolic potential of LAB and bifidobacteria, improving their use in bioprocessing and their utilization in biotechnological and health-related applications.
TI  - Gut microbiome and intestinal mucositis: a new challenge for researchers.
AB  
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 increases lactacin B production when it senses live target bacteria.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 is a probiotic strain used in dairy products. Production of bacteriocin by L. acidophilus La-5 was achieved when it was grown in co-cultures with the yogurt starter species Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. However, bacteriocin induction was not observed when heat-killed cells were used as inducers. This study demonstrates that L. acidophilus La-5 produces lactacin B and that the bacteriocin expression is controlled by an auto-induction mechanism involving the secreted peptide IP_1800. The transcript level of the lactacin B gene cluster expression was investigated in co-cultures between L. acidophilus La-5 and S. thermophilus STY-31 and a remarkable increase of the bacteriocin structural gene (lbaB) transcription was observed. However, lbaB was transcribed constitutively in uninduced L. acidophilus La-5 cells, but the levels of the secreted bacteriocin were not enough to be detected by the agar diffusion assay. A new method for bacteriocin detection was formulated based on the monitoring on real time of Lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei growth in presence of the supernatant and the cell wall extracts of pure and induced L. acidophilus La-5. These results showed that part of lactacin B secreted remains adhered to cell envelope.
TI  - Characterization of tetracycline-resistant Streptococcus thermophilus isolates from Italian soft cheeses.
AB  - Tetracycline-resistant Streptococcus thermophilus isolates from soft cheeses harbored the genes tet(S), tet(M), and tet(L). Molecular analysis of these genes revealed their expression, localization on plasmids or Tn916-Tn1545 family transposons, and their similarity with published sequences. The study highlights the importance of an accurate safety assessment of using S. thermophilus as a starter culture.
TI  - In silico prediction of horizontal gene transfer events in Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus reveals protocooperation in yogurt manufacturing.
AB  - Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus, used in yogurt starter cultures, are well known for their stability and protocooperation during their coexistence in milk. In this study, we show that a close interaction between the two species also takes place at the genetic level. We performed an in silico analysis, combining gene composition and gene transfer mechanism-associated features, and predicted horizontally transferred genes in both L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus. Putative horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events that have occurred between the two bacterial species include the transfer of exopolysaccharide (EPS) biosynthesis genes, transferred from S. thermophilus to L. bulgaricus, and the gene cluster cbs-cblB(cglB)-cysE for the metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids, transferred from L. bulgaricus or Lactobacillus helveticus to S. thermophilus. The HGT event for the cbs-cblB(cglB)-cysE gene cluster was analyzed in detail, with respect to both evolutionary and functional aspects. It can be concluded that during the coexistence of both yogurt starter species in a milk environment, agonistic coevolution at the genetic level has probably been involved in the optimization of their combined growth and interactions.
TI  - Production of fresh Cheddar cheese curds with controlled postacidification and enhanced flavor.
AB  - Cheddar cheese in curd form is very popular in eastern Canada. It is retailed immediately after cheese manufacturing and can be maintained at room temperature for 24 h to provide better texture and mouthfeel. Subsequently, the cheese curds must be stored at 4 degrees C. The shelf life is generally 3 d. In this study, Cheddar cheese curds were produced by adding a high diacetyl flavor-producing strain (Lactococcus diacetylactis) to a thermophilic-based starter. The objective was to achieve both postacidification stability to increase the shelf life and enhanced flavor. The addition of L. diacetylactis increased processing time but did not affect cheese composition or the evolution of proteolysis and texture. During cheese manufacturing, streptococci became the dominant microflora in all cheeses, whereas populations of Lactococcus cremoris and L. diacetylactis decreased. During cheese storage, viable counts of L. diacetylactis and Streptococcus thermophilus increased but the counts of L. cremoris decreased. During cheese manufacturing and storage, the concentrations of lactic acid and diacetyl increased rapidly in cheeses produced with L. diacetylactis. Citric acid and galactose contents remained high in cheese made without L. diacetylactis. Sensory evaluation indicated that cheeses containing the L. diacetylactis strain were more flavorful and also had less sourness and could be stored at 4 degrees C for up to 7 d.
TI  - The relevance of carbon dioxide metabolism in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus is a major component of dairy starter cultures used for the manufacture of yoghurt and cheese. In this study, the CO(2) metabolism of S. thermophilus DSM 20617(T), grown in either a N(2) atmosphere or an enriched CO(2) atmosphere, was analysed using both genetic and proteomic approaches. Growth experiments performed in a chemically defined medium revealed that CO(2) depletion resulted in bacterial arginine, aspartate and uracil auxotrophy. Moreover, CO(2) depletion governed a significant change in cell morphology, and a high reduction in biomass production. A comparative proteomic analysis revealed that cells of S. thermophilus showed a different degree of energy status depending on the CO(2) availability. In agreement with proteomic data, cells grown under N(2) showed a significantly higher milk acidification rate compared with those grown in an enriched CO(2) atmosphere. Experiments carried out on S. thermophilus wild-type and its derivative mutant, which was inactivated in the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and carbamoyl-phosphate synthase activities responsible for fixing CO(2) to organic molecules, suggested that the anaplerotic reactions governed by these enzymes have a central role in bacterial metabolism. Our results reveal the capnophilic nature of this micro-organism, underlining the essential role of CO(2) in S. thermophilus physiology, and suggesting potential applications in dairy fermentation processes.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria by broth microdilution method and Etest.
AB  - We applied two methods of broth microdilution and Etest for measuring minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria for 15 antimicrobial agents to compare the feasibility, reproducibility, and equivalence of the two methods. Both methods were originally described by the European projects PROSAFE and ACE-ART. In 84% combinations of strains and antimicrobial agents MIC differences between the two methods were within one Log(2) dilution. In the case of rifampicin the difference between the two methods was more than ten-fold. We further determined MICs of 70 strains (14 strains of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, 16 strains of Lactococcus lactis, 30 strains of Streptococcus thermophilus, and 10 strains of Bifidobacterium longum) by the broth microdilution method. In most cases, MIC distributions were uni-modal and within 5 Log(2) dilutions except for the MIC distribution of L. lactis to the aminoglycoside group which was broader. These data are a good basis for improving knowledge of antimicrobial susceptibility of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria, and can be used to revise tentative epidemiological cut-off values.
TI  - Tina wooden vat biofilm: a safe and highly efficient lactic acid bacteria delivering system in PDO Ragusano cheese making.
AB  - In the Sicilian PDO Ragusano cheese making, raw milk is placed in a wooden vat called a Tina. As no starter is added, lactic acid is produced by milk flora and flora released from the Tina biofilm. The aim of this work was to assess the safety and efficiency of this natural inoculation system. From 15 Tinas' biofilms, bacteria total counts varied from 10(3) to 10(6) CFU/cm(2), with the predominance of thermophilic lactic acid bacteria. Low counts of yeasts and moulds were found in a few Tinas. Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli O157:H7 were totally absent, as assessed by conventional plating and the Bax detection system after enrichment, highlighting the safety of the system. From four Tinas out of the 15, micropieces of wood were observed by confocal and scanning electron microscopy. The biofilm entrapped in a matrix covered almost entirely the surface of the wood. Polysaccharides were detected in the four Tinas. In three of the latter, cocci were predominant in the ecosystem whereas in the other one, cocci, bacilli, yeasts and moulds were observed. Fifty litres of microfiltrated milk (<10 CFU/mL) were poured in the four Tinas for 10 min of contact. Enumeration of lactic acid bacteria, yeasts and enterococci were performed in the milk after contact. Depending on the Tina, from 5.10(4) to 10(6) CFU/mL of Streptococcus thermophilus were released into the milk, and from 10(4) to 10(5) CFU/mL of thermophilic lactobacilli. Spontaneous acidification after contact confirmed the high efficiency of biofilm lactic acid bacteria delivery.
TI  - [Identification of probiotic lactic acid bacteria strains].
AB  - The identification of 5 probiotic strains of lactic acid bacteria has been conducted by the method of analysis of physiological properties, API-testing as well as by molecular-genetic methods. It has been confirmed that 4 strains belong to Lactobacillus plantarum, Enterococcus faecium and Streptococcus thermophilus species. S. thermophilus strain has been reidentified as E. durans. The importance of clear identification of microorganism species which is used in probiotics has been demonstrated.
TI  - Inhibition of spoilage yeasts in cheese by killer yeast Williopsis saturnus var.  saturnus.
AB  - Williopsis saturnus var. saturnus is a known killer toxin-producing yeast. The effects of this yeast as a biopreservative against spoilage yeasts (galactose fermenting) were investigated in cheeses made under laboratory conditions. At an inoculation level of approximately 10(6) CFU/g of cheese, this killer yeast inhibited growth of lactose non-fermenting but galactose-fermenting yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae VL1 inoculated at approximately 10(3) CFU/g; it also inhibited growth of lactose-fermenting and galactose-fermenting yeast Kluvyveromyces marxianus ATCC8640 inoculated at approximately 10(3)-10(4) CFU/g in the cheeses manufactured with galactose-producing starter culture Streptococcus thermophilus. In contrast, the two spoilage yeasts grew to approximately 10(6) CFU/g from the initial cell count of approximately 10(3) CFU/g without the killer yeast. This study indicated that W. saturnus var. saturnus could be an effective biopreservative for cheese spoilage control.
TI  - Genome-scale model of Streptococcus thermophilus LMG18311 for metabolic comparison of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - In this report, we describe the amino acid metabolism and amino acid dependency of the dairy bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus LMG18311 and compare them with those of two other characterized lactic acid bacteria, Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus plantarum. Through the construction of a genome-scale metabolic model of S. thermophilus, the metabolic differences between the three bacteria were visualized by direct projection on a metabolic map. The comparative analysis revealed the minimal amino acid auxotrophy (only histidine and methionine or cysteine) of S. thermophilus LMG18311 and the broad variety of volatiles produced from amino acids compared to the other two bacteria. It also revealed the limited number of pyruvate branches, forcing this strain to use the homofermentative metabolism for growth optimization. In addition, some industrially relevant features could be identified in S. thermophilus, such as the unique pathway for acetaldehyde (yogurt flavor) production and the absence of a complete pentose phosphate pathway.
TI  - Probiotics reduce the inflammatory response induced by a high-fat diet in the liver of young rats.
AB  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common form of chronic liver disease in the pediatric population. Preliminary evidence suggests a potential therapeutic utility of probiotics for this condition. Here, we tested the potential effect of the probiotic VSL#3 (a multistrain preparation composed of Streptococcus thermophilus and several species of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria) on oxidative and inflammatory damage induced by a high-fat diet in the liver of young rats. At weaning, young male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 3 groups (n = 6) fed a standard, nonpurified diet (Std; 5.5% of energy from fat) or a high-fat liquid diet (HFD; 71% of energy from fat). One of the HFD groups received by gavage VSL#3 (13 x 10(9) bacteria x kg(-1) x d(-1)). After 4 wk, the HFD rats had greater body weight gain, fat mass, serum aminotransferase, and liver weight than rats fed the Std diet. The HFD induced liver lipid peroxidation, tumor necrosis factor (TNFalpha) production, protein S-nitrosylation, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression, and metalloproteinase (MMP) activity. Moreover, in the HFD group, PPARalpha expression was less than in rats fed the Std diet. In rats fed the HFD diet and treated with VSL#3, liver TNFalpha levels, MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities, and expression of iNOS and COX-2 were significantly lower than in the HFD group. In VSL#3-treated rats, PPARalpha expression was greater than in the HFD group. A modulation of the nuclear factor-kappaB pathway by VSL#3 was also demonstrated. Our data suggest that VSL#3 administration could limit oxidative and inflammatory liver damage in patients with NAFLD.
TI  - Effects of Streptococcus thermophilus TH-4 on intestinal mucositis induced by the chemotherapeutic agent, 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU).
AB  - Beneficial bacteria (probiotics) and probiotic-derived factors have the potential to ameliorate disorders of the intestine. The aim of this study was to compare live Streptococcus thermophilus TH-4 (TH-4), dead TH-4 and TH-4 supernatant in rats treated with 5-Fluorouracil. Rats were randomly allocated to five treatment groups (n=8-10): Saline+Water; 5-FU+Skim Milk; 5-FU+Live TH-4; 5-FU+Supernatant TH-4; and 5-FU+Dead TH-4. 5-FU (150mg.kg(-1)) was administered by a single intraperitoneal injection on day 0; animals were killed on day 4. Treatments were administered daily from days -2 to 3 via oro-gastric gavage. Metabolic parameters were measured daily. Blood was obtained by cardiac puncture, and intestinal tissues removed for quantitative and qualitative histological assessment, including: villous height and area; crypt depth and area, mitotic count and crypt fission; biochemical determination of sucrase and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity; and disease severity scoring. One-way ANOVA statistical analyses were conducted for the majority of outcome measures. Live TH-4 significantly reduced disease severity score by 13% (p< 0.05), and partially normalised mitotic counts compared with 5-FU+Skim milk controls. Live and supernatant TH-4 reduced crypt fission by 69% and 48% (p< 0.05), respectively, compared to 5-FU+Skim Milk controls. No significant differences (p> 0.05) in the occurrence of bacteraemia were evident across all groups. Live TH-4 partially normalised mitotic count and histological severity score in 5-FU treated rats. The inhibitory effect of live TH-4 and TH-4 supernatant on crypt fission suggests therapeutic utility in the prevention of disorders characterised by increased crypt fission, such as colorectal carcinoma.
TI  - Carbamoylphosphate synthetase activity is essential for the optimal growth of Streptococcus thermophilus in milk.
AB  - AIM: The aim of the study was to study the role of carbon dioxide metabolism in Streptococcus thermophilus through investigation of the phenotype of a carbamoylphosphate synthetase-negative mutant. METHODS AND RESULTS: The effect of carbon dioxide on the nutritional requirements of Strep. thermophilus DSM20617(T) and its derivative, carbamoylphosphate synthetase-negative mutant A17(DeltacarB), was investigated by cultivating the strain in a chemically defined medium under diverse gas compositions and in milk. The results obtained revealed that CO(2) depletion or carB gene inactivation determined the auxotrophy of Strep. thermophilus for l-arginine and uracil. In addition, the parent strain grew faster than the mutant, even when milk was supplemented with uracil or arginine. CONCLUSIONS: Milk growth experiments underlined that carbamoylphosphate synthetase activity was essential for the optimal growth of Strep. thermophilus in milk. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The study of the carbon dioxide metabolism in Strep. thermophilus revealed new insights with regard to the metabolism of this species, which could be useful for the optimization of dairy fermentation processes.
TI  - Functionality of exopolysaccharides produced by lactic acid bacteria in an in vitro gastric system.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate whether slime-exopolysaccharides (EPS) or capsular-polysaccharide (CPS) production could protect the polymer-producing strains Streptococcus thermophilus CRL 1190 and Lactobacillus casei CRL 87 against the harsh conditions of an in vitro gastric system (GS). EPS stability on the GS was studied. METHODS AND RESULTS: An in vitro GS model containing human saliva and gastric juice was standardized. Polymer functionality on the cell viability and metabolic activity of the EPS-producing strains in the GS acidic conditions was evaluated. Two isogenic EPS/CPS deficient mutants were used for comparison. EPS or CPS conferred no significant protection on the cell viability of the studied strains after passage through the GS conditions. However, the phospho- and beta-galactosidase activities of the EPS(+) strains were higher than those of the EPS(-). Cytoplasmic alterations in the wild-type and mutant strains and partial degradation of both EPS were detected. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of EPS/CPS protected the metabolic activity of the assayed LAB strains, but had no effect on survival at low pH. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The presence of EPS/CPS as well as polymer resistance to the harsh conditions of the human GS could impact positively in probiotic strains to exert their properties in the host.
TI  - Effects of Streptococcus thermophilus TH-4 on intestinal mucositis induced by the chemotherapeutic agent 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU).
AB  - Beneficial bacteria (probiotics) and probiotic-derived factors have the potential to ameliorate disorders of the intestine. The aim of this study was to compare live Streptococcus thermophilus TH-4 (TH-4), dead TH-4 and TH-4 supernatant in rats treated with 5-Fluorouracil. Rats were randomly allocated to five treatment groups (n = 8-10): Saline + Water; 5-FU + Skim Milk; 5-FU+ Live TH-4; 5-FU + Supernatant TH-4; and 5-FU + Dead TH-4.5-FU (150 mg.kg-1) was administered by a single intraperitoneal injection on day zero; animals were killed on day four. Treatments were administered daily from days -2 to +3 via oro-gastric gavage. Metabolic parameters were measured daily. Blood was obtained by cardiac puncture, and intestinal tissues removed for quantitative and qualitative histological assessment, including: villus height and area; crypt depth and area, mitotic count and crypt fission;biochemical determination of sucrase and myeloperoxidase (MPO)activity; and disease severity scoring. One-way ANOVA statistical analyses were conducted for the majority of outcome measures. Live TH-4 significantly reduced disease severity score by 13% (p< 0.05), and partially normalized mitotic counts compared with 5-FU + Skim Milk controls. Live and Supernatant TH-4 reduced crypt fission by 69% and 48% (p < 0.05), respectively, compared to 5-FU + Skim Milk controls. No significant differences (p > 0.05) in the occurrence of bacteraemia were evident across all groups. Live TH-4 partially normalized mitotic count and histological severity score in 5-FU treated rats. The inhibitory effect of live TH-4 and TH-4 Supernatant on crypt fission suggests therapeutic utility in the prevention of disorders characterized by increased crypt fission,such as colorectal carcinoma.
TI  - Enumeration of starter cultures during yogurt production using Petrifilm AC plates associated with acidified MRS and M17 broths.
AB  - The efficiency of Petrifilm AC (3M Microbiology, St. Paul, MN, USA) associated with the broths M17 and de Mann-Rogosa-Sharpe (MRS) at pH 5.4 was evaluated to enumerate Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus during the yogurt production. Commercial and reference strains of these microorganisms were experimentally inoculated in nonfat milk and incubated at 42 degrees C for 4 h for yogurt production. At the moment of inoculation and after incubation, aliquots were collected, submitted to dilution using the broths M17 and MRS at pH 5.4, and plated for Strep. salivarius and Lb. bulgaricus enumeration according ISO 9232 and at Petrifilm AC plates, respectively. M17 plates were incubated at 42 degrees C, and MRS plates were incubated at 35 degrees C under anaerobiosis. After 48 h, the formed colonies were enumerated and the counts were compared by correlation and analysis of variance (P<0.05). In addition, colonies were randomly selected from all plates and characterized according to Gram staining and morphology. The obtained results indicated that Petrifilm AC plates associated to M17 and MRS at pH 5.4 can be considered as a suitable alternative for Strep. salivarius and Lb. bulgaricus enumeration during yogurt production, with slight interferences due to the acidity of MRS at the moment of inoculation, and due to the acidity of yogurt at the end of fermentation process. It was also observed that the MRS at pH 5.4 was not sufficiently selective for Lb. delbrueckii enumeration, despite it is indicated by the official protocol from ISO 9232.
TI  - Short motif sequences determine the targets of the prokaryotic CRISPR defence system.
AB  - Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and their associated CRISPR-associated sequence (CAS) proteins constitute a novel antiviral defence system that is widespread in prokaryotes. Repeats are separated by spacers, some of them homologous to sequences in mobile genetic elements. Although the whole process involved remains uncharacterized, it is known that new spacers are incorporated into CRISPR loci of the host during a phage challenge, conferring specific resistance against the virus. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that such interference is based on small RNAs carrying a spacer. These RNAs would guide the defence apparatus to foreign molecules carrying sequences that match the spacers. Despite this essential role, the spacer uptake mechanism has not been addressed. A first step forward came from the detection of motifs associated with spacer precursors (proto-spacers) of Streptococcus thermophilus, revealing a specific recognition of donor sequences in this species. Here we show that the conservation of proto-spacer adjacent motifs (PAMs) is a common theme for the most diverse CRISPR systems. The PAM sequence depends on the CRISPR-CAS variant, implying that there is a CRISPR-type-specific (motif-directed) choice of the spacers, which subsequently determines the interference target. PAMs also direct the orientation of spacers in the repeat arrays. Remarkably, observations based on such polarity argue against a recognition of the spacer precursors on transcript RNA molecules as a general rule.
TI  - Capillary zone electrophoresis for enumeration of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus in yogurt.
AB  - Enumeration of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus is a priority due to their importance in yogurt production. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) of both bacteria could be achieved in 7.2 min with a resolution of 3.2 in the background electrolyte (BGE) containing 4.5mM Tris(hydroxymethyl) amminomethane (TRIS)-4.5 mM boric acid-0.1 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetate (EDTA) (TBE) buffer (pH 8.4) and 0.05% (v/v) polyethylene oxide (PEO), using a capillary of 47.5 cm (effective length) x 100 microm i.d., injection of 50 mbar x 3s followed by -5kV x 120s, a voltage and temperature of 20 kV and 25 degrees C, respectively. Appropriate amounts of PEO in the BGE, sample preparation (i.e. vortex) and introduction were key factors for their separation. A short hydrodynamic injection followed by applying reversed polarity voltage could compress the bacteria into narrow zones, which were detected as separated single peaks. Method linearity (r(2)>0.99), precision (%RSDs<9.3%), recovery (%R=91.7-106.7%) and limit of quantitation (1.0 x 10(6) colony forming unit per mL (CFU/mL)) were satisfactory. Results from the CE analysis of both bacteria in yogurt were not statistically different from those of the plate count method (P>0.05). The CE method can be used as an alternative for quantitation of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus in yogurt since it was reliable, simple, cost and labor effective and rapid, allowing the analysis of 3 samples/h (comparing to 2d/sample by plate count method).
TI  - Effect of exopolysaccharides on the proteolytic and angiotensin-I converting enzyme-inhibitory activities and textural and rheological properties of low-fat yogurt during refrigerated storage.
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the influence of using exopolysaccharide (EPS) producing strain of Streptococcus thermophilus on the viability of yogurt starters, their proteolytic and angiotensin-I converting enzyme-inhibitory activities, and on the textural and rheological properties of the low-fat yogurt during storage at 4 degrees C for 28 d. The use of an EPS-producing strain of S. thermophilus did not have influence on pH, lactic acid content, or the angiotensin-I converting enzyme-inhibition activity of low-fat yogurt. However, EPS showed a protective effect on the survival of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus. Presence of EPS reduced the firmness, spontaneous whey separation, yield stress, and hysteresis loop area but not the consistency and flow behavior index of low-fat yogurt.
TI  - Study of microbial diversity in raw milk and fresh curd used for Fontina cheese production by culture-independent methods.
AB  - The bacterial populations of raw milk employed for the production of Fontina cheese in alpine farms located in different valleys and altitudes (from 700 to 2246 m above sea level) were investigated by culture independent techniques. Total microbial DNA was isolated from milk and curd samples and used as template in Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to study the hypervariable V3 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and analyzed by Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE). Representative bands of DGGE patterns were sequenced for identification purposes. The use of universal primer for PCR-DGGE allowed the description of the bacterial community, not only for the presence of lactic acid bacteria, but also for other adventitious species. DGGE profiles obtained from milk and fresh curd samples were generally different and typical for each farm, although some recurrent bands were observed. Cluster analysis of DGGE profiles did not show high similarity among samples and it was probably dependent on the different geographical areas of pastures. Some Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) recurred in many samples (Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc lactis) indicating that alpine milk is a preferential niche for their colonization. The microbiota included not only mesophilic and thermoresistant LAB but also adventitious bacteria (Macrococcus caseolyticus, Rothia spp.) and psychrotrophic bacteria (Chryseobacterium spp., Pseudomonas spp.), that were found in almost all samples, but disappeared after the warming up at 47-48 degrees C of coagulated milk. Pantoea spp. was primarily found in curds and only with a low incidence in milk samples, indicating the environmental origin. Finally the sequencing data confirmed the presence of E. faecium, E. faecalis and S. thermophilus as major species present in the curd. These species were found also in raw milk, proving its importance as source of the typical fermenting microflora.
TI  - Streptococcus thermophilus produces exopolysaccharides including hyaluronic acid.
AB  - Hyaluronic acid (HA) is an important material for medical, cosmetic and food applications. HA is obtained commercially from rooster combs and the fermentation of streptococci. However, the safety problems such as hyaluronidase or exotoxin contamination remain controversial. To reduce the risk of hyaluronidase or exotoxin contamination, we attempted to isolate strains of Streptococcus thermophilus with high productivity of useful exopolysaccharides (EPSs) including HA from traditional dairy food products. Forty-six S. thermophilus strains were isolated from dairy food products, and examined of their HA production using a HA binding protein method. According to the results, six S. thermophilus strains produced EPSs including HA. S. thermophilus YIT 2084 had a markedly high HA productivity (approximately 8 mg/l). We focused on the high-molecular-mass fraction of EPS (2000 kDa) from S. thermophilus YIT 2084. By using high-performance liquid chromatography, it was found that a high-molecular-mass fraction of EPS included N-acetylglucosamine (54.4%) and glucuronic acid (45.6%), which are components of HA. Furthermore, 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed that the spectra of the high-molecular-mass fraction corresponded well to those of commercial HA. Here, we described for the first time that S. thermophilus, which is a generally recognized safe bacterium, produces HA. The novel HA-producing bacterium S thermophilus YIT 2084 has great potential for applications in the medical, cosmetic and food fields, although its culture conditions remain to be improved.

TI  - A unique lantibiotic, thermophilin 1277, containing a disulfide bridge and two thioether bridges.
AB  - AIMS: To identify the chemical structure of a bacteriocin, thermophilin 1277, produced by Streptococcus thermophilus SBT1277. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thermophilin 1277 was purified and partial N-terminal sequence analysis revealed 6 unidentified amino acids amongst 31 amino acids residues. A 2.7-kbp region containing the thermophilin 1277 structural gene (tepA) encoding 58 amino acids was cloned and sequenced. Mature thermophilin 1277 (33 amino acids) was preceded by a 25-amino acid putative leader peptide containing a double glycine cleavage motif. Peptide sequence analysis following chemical modification of thermophilin 1277 revealed that the Cys21 and Cys29 residues form a disulfide bridge and that Thr8 or Thr10 forms two 3-methyllanthionines with Cys13 or Cys32 via thioether bridges. Antimicrobial activity was disrupted by ethanethiol or reductive agent treatments, indicating that the internal amino acid modifications are crucial for the activity. CONCLUSIONS: Thermophilin 1277 from Strep. thermophilus SBT1277 belongs to the class of AII-type lantibiotics that has a disulfide and two thioether bridges. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first report of a lantibiotic produced by a GRAS species of Strep. thermophilus; thermophilin 1277 has a unique structure containing both a disulfide bridge and two thioether bridges that are crucial for its activity.
TI  - A qualified presumption of safety approach for the safety assessment of Grana Padano whey starters.
AB  - A Qualified Presumption of Safety (QPS) approach was applied to dominant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) associated with Grana Padano cheese whey starters. Thirty-two strains belonging to Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Lactobacillus fermentum, and representing the overall genotypic LAB diversity associated with 24 previously collected whey starters [Rossetti, L., Fornasari, M.E., Gatti, M., Lazzi, C., Neviani, E., Giraffa, G., 2008. Grana Padano cheese whey starters: microbial composition and strain distribution. International Journal of Food Microbiology 127, 168-171], were analyzed. All L. helveticus, L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, and S. thermophilus isolates were susceptible to four (i.e. vancomycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, and erythromycin) of the clinically most relevant antibiotics. One L. fermentum strain displayed phenotypic resistance to tetracycline (Tet(R)), with MIC of 32 microg/ml, and gentamycin (Gm(R)), with MIC of 32 microg/ml. PCR was applied to this strain to test the presence of genes tet(L), tet(M), tet(S), and aac(6')-aph(2')-Ia, which are involved in horizontal transfer of Tet(R) and Gm(R), respectively but no detectable amplification products were observed. According to QPS criteria, we conclude that Grana cheese whey starters do not present particular safety concerns.
TI  - Conjugative transfer of the integrative conjugative elements ICESt1 and ICESt3 from Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs), also called conjugative transposons, are genomic islands that excise, self-transfer by conjugation, and integrate in the genome of the recipient bacterium. The current investigation shows the intraspecies conjugative transfer of the first described ICEs in Streptococcus thermophilus, ICESt1 and ICESt3. Mitomycin C, a DNA-damaging agent, derepresses ICESt3 conjugative transfer almost 25-fold. The ICESt3 host range was determined using various members of the Firmicutes as recipients. Whereas numerous ICESt3 transconjugants of Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis were recovered, only one transconjugant of Lactococcus lactis was obtained. The newly incoming ICEs, except the one from L. lactis, are site-specifically integrated into the 3' end of the fda gene and are still able to excise in these transconjugants. Furthermore, ICESt3 was retransferred from E. faecalis to S. thermophilus. Recombinant plasmids carrying different parts of the ICESt1 recombination module were used to show that the integrase gene is required for the site-specific integration and excision of the ICEs, whereas the excisionase gene is required for the site-specific excision only.
TI  - Insertion of a heterologous gene construct into a non-functional ORF of the Streptococcus thermophilus chromosome.
AB  - An integrative vector was constructed for inserting heterologous genes within a non-functional open reading frame (ORF) on the chromosome of Streptococcus thermophilus. The vector, pINTRS, contained a temperature sensitive origin of replication and an erythromycin resistance gene for initial selection in S. thermophilus. The region of the vector containing unique cloning sites, for insertion of recombinant genes, was flanked by homologous DNA sequences corresponding to a pseudogene in S. thermophilus to facilitate chromosomal integration. The gene encoding green fluorescent protein, regulated by a plasmid borne hsp promoter of S. thermophilus, was cloned into pINTRS to demonstrate proper functioning of the vector.
TI  - The CHAP domain of Cse functions as an endopeptidase that acts at mature septa to promote Streptococcus thermophilus cell separation.
AB  - Cell separation is dependent on cell wall hydrolases that cleave the peptidoglycan shared between daughter cells. In Streptococcus thermophilus, this step is performed by the Cse protein whose depletion resulted in the formation of extremely long chains of cells. Cse, a natural chimeric enzyme created by domain shuffling, carries at least two important domains for its activity: the LysM expected to be responsible for the cell wall-binding and the CHAP domain predicted to contain the active centre. Accordingly, the localization of Cse on S. thermophilus cell surface has been undertaken by immunogold electron and immunofluorescence microscopies using of antibodies raised against the N-terminal end of this protein. Immunolocalization shows the presence of the Cse protein at mature septa. Moreover, the CHAP domain of Cse exhibits a cell wall lytic activity in zymograms performed with cell walls of Micrococcus lysodeikticus, Bacillus subtilis and S. thermophilus. Additionally, RP-HPLC analysis of muropeptides released from B. subtilis and S. thermophilus cell wall after digestion with the CHAP domain shows that Cse is an endopeptidase. Altogether, these results suggest that Cse is a cell wall hydrolase involved in daughter cell separation of S. thermophilus.
TI  - Fat-free yogurt made using a galactose-positive exopolysaccharide-producing recombinant strain of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - To prevent textural defects in low-fat and fat-free yogurts, fat substitutes are  routinely added to milk. In situ production of exopolysaccharides (EPS) by starter cultures is an acknowledged alternative to the addition of biothickeners. With the aim of increasing in situ EPS production, a recombinant galactose-positive EPS(+) Streptococcus thermophilus strain, RD-534-S1, was generated and compared with the parent galactose-negative EPS(+) strain RD-534. The RD-534-S1 strain produced up to 84 mg/L of EPS during a single-strain milk fermentation process, which represented 1.3 times more than the EPS produced by strain RD-534. Under conditions that mimic industrial yogurt production, the starter culture consisting of RD-534-S1 and (EPS(-)) Lactobacillus bulgaricus L210R strain (RD-534-S1/L210R) led to an EPS production increase of 1.65-fold as compared with RD-534-S1 alone. However, the amount of EPS produced did not differ from that found in yogurts produced using an isogenic starter culture that included the parent S. thermophilus strain RD-534 and Lb. bulgaricus L210R (RD-534/L210R). Moreover, the gel characteristics of set-style yogurt and the rheological properties of stirred-style yogurt produced using RD-534-S1/L210R were similar to the values obtained for yogurts made with RD-534/L210R. In conclusion, it is possible to increase the production of EPS by ropy S. thermophilus strains through genetic engineering of galactose metabolism. However, when used in combination with Lb. bulgaricus for yogurt manufacture, the EPS overproduction of recombinant strain is not significant.
TI  - Effect of inactivation of stress response regulators on the growth and survival of Streptococcus thermophilus Sfi39.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus is an important dairy starter used for the manufacture of fermented milks and cheeses. As for many other lactic acid bacteria, its survival during propagation and preservation of starter cultures and its performance in dairy fermentations are significantly affected by its ability to cope with many environmental stresses. This, in turn, is dependent on the expression of a several genes, which is often controlled by negative response regulators, and has complex relationships with the control of metabolism. In this paper we describe the effect of growth phase, adaptation and inactivation of genes for stress response regulators (hrcA, ctsR and rr01) on the growth, acid production and stress resistance and intracellular protein patterns in the yoghurt strain S. thermophilus Sfi39. Inactivation of stress response regulators significantly affected growth, acid production in milk and stress tolerance. Although mutants showed an increased resistance during the exponential phase compared to the wild type strain, the effect of the mutations was complex and in some cases mutants were unable to mount an acid- or heat-shock response after exposure to mild heat and acid stresses. Significant differences in intracellular protein patterns analyzed by SDS-PAGE and 2-DE/mass spectrometry were found as a function of growth phase, adaptation and mutation, but a detailed transcriptomic and proteomic study would be needed to provide a mechanistic interpretation of the effect of the mutations and to identify a strategy for the construction of food-grade mutants with improved growth and performances.
TI  - Postgenomic analysis of streptococcus thermophilus cocultivated in milk with Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus: involvement of nitrogen, purine, and iron metabolism.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus is one of the most widely used lactic acid bacteria in the dairy industry, in particular in yoghurt manufacture, where it is associated with Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. This bacterial association, known as a proto-cooperation, is poorly documented at the molecular and regulatory levels. We thus investigate the kinetics of the transcriptomic and proteomic modifications of S. thermophilus LMG 18311 in response to the presence of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus ATCC 11842 during growth in milk at two growth stages. Seventy-seven different genes or proteins (4.1% of total coding sequences), implicated mainly in the metabolism of nitrogen (24%), nucleotide base (21%), and iron (20%), varied specifically in coculture. One of the most unpredicted results was a significant decrease of most of the transcripts and enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis. Interestingly, the expression of nearly all genes potentially encoding iron transporters of S. thermophilus decreased, whereas that of iron-chelating dpr as well as that of the fur (perR) regulator genes increased, suggesting a reduction in the intracellular iron concentration, probably in response to H(2)O(2) production by L. bulgaricus. The present study reveals undocumented nutritional exchanges and regulatory relationships between the two yoghurt bacteria, which provide new molecular clues for the understanding of their associative behavior.
TI  - [Fresh versus pasteurized yogurt: comparative study of the effects on microbiological and immunological parameters, and gastrointestinal comfort].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the beneficial effects of yogurt are dependent on the viability of lactic bacteria and exclusive to fresh yogurt, by comparison with the effects of yogurt that is pasteurized after fermentation. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Using a double-blind design in a healthy adult population over 75 days, we compared the effects of fresh and pasteurized yogurt on microbiological (presence of viable bacteria in yogurt and DNA detection in feces) and immunological (nephelometry, hematometry, and flow cytometry) parameters. A questionnaire was used to assess gastrointestinal comfort. Differences in lactose absorption after ingestion of fresh or pasteurized yogurt were determined by breath hydrogen analysis. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the results obtained for microbiological or immunological parameters, gastrointestinal comfort, or lactose test between the two types of yogurt ingested. Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (L. bulgaricus) was isolated in 0.7% of the fecal samples analyzed. Streptococcus thermophilus was not found in any sample. DNA from lactic bacteria was detected in only 12.5% of the samples analyzed. CONCLUSION: Transit through the gastrointestinal tract affects survival of L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus. No differences were found in the immunological parameters, gastrointestinal comfort, or lactose overload after intake of fresh or pasteurized yogurt.
TI  - Fluorescent-BOX-PCR for resolving bacterial genetic diversity, endemism and biogeography.
AB  - BACKGROUND: BOX-A1R-based repetitive extragenic palindromic-PCR (BOX-PCR) is one  of the most used techniques in biogeography studies of microbial isolates. However the traditional separation of BOX-PCR patterns by agarose gel electrophoresis suffers many limitations. The aim of this research was to set up a fluorescent BOX-PCR (F-BOX-PCR) assay in which separation of PCR products is automated in a capillary electrophoresis system. F-BOX-PCR was compared with the traditional BOX-PCR using bacterial strains with different G+C content (Bacillus cereus; Escherichia coli; isolates of the family Geodermatophilaceae). Resolution, discriminatory power and reproducibility were evaluated by assaying different electrophoretic runs, PCR reactions and independent DNA extractions. BOX-PCR and F-BOX-PCR were compared for the analysis of 29 strains of Modestobacter multiseptatus isolated from three different microsites in an altered carbonatic wall from Cagliari, Italy, and 45 strains of Streptococcus thermophilus isolated from 34 samples of the hand-made, yogurt-like product Matsoni, collected in different locations in Georgia. RESULTS: Fluorophore 6-FAM proved more informative than HEX and BOX-PCR both in agarose gel electrophoresis (p < 0.004 and p < 0.00003) and in capillary electrophoresis (compared only with HEX, p < 2 x 10(-7)). 6-FAM- and HEX-based F-BOX-PCR respectively detected up to 12.0 and 11.3 times more fragments than BOX-PCR. Replicate separations of F-BOX-PCR showed an accuracy of the size calling of +/- 0.5 bp until 500 bp, constantly decreasing to +/- 10 bp at 2000 bp. Cluster analysis of F-BOX-PCR profiles grouped M. multiseptatus strains according to the microsite of isolation and S. thermophilus strains according to the geographical origin of Matsoni, but resulted intermixed when a BOX-PCR dataset was used. CONCLUSION: F-BOX-PCR represents an improved method for addressing bacterial biogeography studies both in term of sensitivity, reproducibility and data analysis.
TI  - Development of chemically defined media supporting high-cell-density growth of lactococci, enterococci, and streptococci.
AB  - Lactococcus lactis IL1403 was used as an experimental strain to develop a chemically defined medium for study of the physiology and metabolic pathways of lactococci. An experimental leave-one-out technique was employed to determine the necessity of each of the 57 chemical components used in medium development. A statistical experimental design approach including three fractional factorial designs and a central composite design was used to optimize the fermentation process with 21 variables composed of 19 nutritional factors grouped from the 57 components and two environmental factors (initial pH and temperature). For L. lactis IL1403, the maximum biomass concentrations obtained with the two optimal chemically defined media developed in this study (ZMB1 and ZMB2) were generally 3.5- to 4-fold higher than the maximum biomass concentrations obtained with the previously described best synthetic media (SA) and 50% to 68% higher than the maximum biomass concentrations obtained with M17, a complex medium commonly used for lactococci. The new chemically defined media support high-cell-density growth of numerous strains of L. lactis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus thermophilus.

TI  - Maturing dynamics of surface microflora in Fontina PDO cheese studied by culture-dependent and -independent methods.
AB  - AIMS: To study the evolution of rind microbial communities in Fontina PDO cheese. METHODS AND RESULTS: Four batches were examined for their surface microflora during ripening, carried out in two different maturing caves, at Ollomont and Pre-Saint-Didier, Aosta Valley region, Northwest of Italy. Culture-dependent methodologies were combined with culture-independent analysis (PCR-DGGE). Yeasts were found to increase from 10(3) to 10(6) CFU cm(-2) in 28 days, with consequent rise of surface pH, which allowed the growth of salt-tolerant bacteria, in particular coryneforms which reached 10(9) CFU cm(-2) at the end of 3 months. Coagulase-negative cocci and lactic acid bacteria reached 10(7) CFU cm(-2) in the same period. Debaryomyces hansenii and Candida sake were the species more constantly present throughout the whole maturing process. As early as after 1 day since manufacture, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus were detected on cheese rinds. Arthrobacter nicotianae, Brevibacterium casei and Corynebacterium glutamicum were found after 7-28 days. CONCLUSIONS: According to cluster analysis of DGGE profiles, the maturing environment seemed to influence the dynamics of microbial groups on Fontina surfaces. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These results represent a first picture of micro-organisms colonizing Fontina PDO rinds. Further studies are in progress to better understand the origin of this surface microflora and to formulate surface starters.
TI  - French marine bark extract pycnogenol as a possible enrichment ingredient for yogurt.
AB  - The influence of Pycnogenol, French marine bark extract, added to yogurt preparation on the viability of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus and on pH, titratable acidity, macro-nutrients, and folate content were evaluated throughout the shelf life of products. At all concentrations studied, Pycnogenol additions neither significantly affected the growth of microorganisms nor caused any modification of nutritional parameters during storage in yogurt. To highlight any possible degradation of Pycnogenol components by yogurt flora, an estimation of total polyphenol contents and an evaluation of some phenolic compounds in yogurt at the greatest concentration of Pycnogenol were carried out at the beginning and at the end of the study. Our data indicates that neither total polyphenol content nor selected phenolic substances (cathechin, epicatechins, chlorogenic acid, and caffeic acid) was affected during the shelf life. In conclusion, these results suggest Pycnogenol as a valuable ingredient to enrich yogurt preparation.
TI  - Effect of mixing during fermentation in yogurt manufacturing.
AB  - In traditional yogurt manufacturing, the yogurt is not agitated during fermentation. However, stirring could be beneficial, particularly for improving heat and mass transport across the fermentation tank. In this contribution, we studied the effect of low-speed agitation during fermentation on process time, acidity profile, and microbial dynamics during yogurt fermentation in 2 laboratory-scale fermenters (3 and 5 L) with different heat-transfer characteristics. Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus were used as fermenting bacteria. Curves of pH, lactic acid concentration, lactose concentration, and bacterial population profiles during fermentation are presented for static and low-agitation conditions during fermentation. At low-inoculum conditions, agitation reduced the processing time by shortening the lag phase. However, mixing did not modify the duration or the shape of the pH profiles during the exponential phase. In fermentors with poor heat-transfer characteristics, important differences in microbial dynamics were observed between the agitated and nonagitated fermentation experiments; that is, agitation significantly increased the observable specific growth rate and the final microbial count of L. bulgaricus.
TI  - The addition of a cocktail of yeast species to Cantalet cheese changes bacterial  survival and enhances aroma compound formation.
AB  - Indigenous yeasts can be detected at high populations in raw milk Cantal cheese,  a French Protected Denomination of Origin (PDO) hard cheese. To investigate their use as adjunct cultures to promote flavour development in Cantalet (small Cantal) cheese, three strains isolated from raw milk Cantal cheese, Kluyveromyces lactis, Yarrowia lipolytica, and Pichia fermentans were added at 3 (E3) and 5 (E5) log(10) colony-forming units (cfu)/mL to microfiltered milk at a ratio of 80/10/10 viable cells, respectively. The global microbial, compositional and biochemical changes induced by the presence of yeasts in cheese were determined. Adjunct yeasts did not grow but stayed at viable populations of approximately 4 and 6 log(10) cfu/g in E3 and E5 cheeses, respectively, throughout the ripening period. They were mainly constituted of K. lactis, while P. fermentans and Y. lipolytica were not detectable after 3 and 45 days of ripening, respectively. Several species of indigenous yeasts were also detected in E3 cheeses at the beginning of ripening only, and in the control cheeses without yeasts added. Lactoccoci survived for longer periods in the presence of yeast adjuncts, while, conversely, the viability of Streptococcus thermophilus decreased more rapidly. The addition of yeasts did not influence cheese composition and total free amino acid content. In contrast, it slightly increased lipolysis in both E3 and E5 cheeses and markedly enhanced the formation of some volatile aroma compounds. The concentrations of ethanol, ethyl esters and some branched-chain alcohols were 6 to 10 fold higher in E5 cheeses than in the control cheeses, and only slightly higher in E3 cheeses. This study shows that K. lactis has a potential as cheese adjunct culture in Cantalet cheese and that, added at populations of 4-5 log(10) cfu/g cheese, it enhances the formation of flavour compounds.
TI  - Effect of pH on characteristics of low-moisture Mozzarella cheese during refrigerated storage.
AB  - This study evaluated the effect of cheese pH on proteolysis, calcium distribution, and functional characteristics of Mozzarella cheese. On 4 occasions, cultured low-moisture part-skim Mozzarella cheeses were obtained from a commercial producer on the day after manufacture. Cheese blocks were randomly assigned to 2 groups. One group was shredded, subdivided, and exposed to either ammonia vapor to increase the pH or HCl vapor to decrease the pH. Samples were vacuum packaged, stored at 4 degrees C, and analyzed for pH 4.6 and 12% TCA soluble nitrogen, apparent viscosity, free oil, and water-soluble calcium on days 5, 12, 22, and 40. The 2nd group was sectioned into 23-mm thick slabs and similarly exposed to either ammonia vapor to increase the pH or HCl vapor to decrease the pH. The slabs were vacuum packaged, stored at 4 degrees C, and analyzed for pH 4.6 and 12% TCA soluble nitrogen, TPA hardness, springiness and cohesiveness, and meltability on days 17, 29, and 41. Data were analyzed by ANOVA according to a spilt-plot design. Experimentally induced pH differences persisted and significantly affected TPA hardness, apparent viscosity, meltability, and water-soluble calcium throughout 40 d of storage, but did not affect soluble nitrogen changes. Thus, cheese pH affected functional characteristics and calcium distribution but did not affect proteolysis rates. Higher cheese pH resulted in a harder cheese that required longer aging to develop desirable melting characteristics, whereas cheese with lower pH developed desirable melting characteristics more quickly but had a shorter functional shelf life.

TI  - Probiotics.
AB  - Probiotics are microorganisms with potential health benefits. They may be used to prevent and treat antibiotic-associated diarrhea and acute infectious diarrhea. They may also be effective in relieving symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, and in treating atopic dermatitis in children. Species commonly used include Lactobacillus sp., Bifidobacterium sp., Streptococcus thermophilus, and Saccharomyces boulardii. Typical dosages vary based on the product, but common dosages range from 5 to 10 billion colony-forming units per day for children, and from 10 to 20 billion colony-forming units per day for adults. Significant adverse effects are rare, and there are no known interactions with medications.
TI  - Effect of different prebiotics on the fermentation kinetics, probiotic survival and fatty acids profiles in nonfat symbiotic fermented milk.
AB  - The simultaneous effects of different binary co-cultures of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium lactis with Streptococcus thermophilus and of different prebiotics on the production of fermented milk were investigated in this paper. In particular, we determined and compared the kinetics of acidification of milk either as such or supplemented with 4% (w/w) maltodextrin, oligofructose and polydextrose, as well as the probiotic survival, chemical composition (pH, lactose, lactic acid and protein contents), fatty acids profile and conjugate linoleic acid (CLA) content of fermented milk after storage at 4 degrees C for 24 h. Fermented milk quality was strongly influenced both by the co-culture composition and the selected prebiotic. Depending on the co-culture, prebiotic addition to milk influenced to different extent kinetic acidification parameters. All probiotic counts were stimulated by oligofructose and polydextrose, and among these B. lactis always exhibited the highest counts in all supplemented milk samples. Polydextrose addition led to the highest post-acidification. Although the contents of the main fatty acids were only barely influenced, the highest amounts of conjugated linoleic acid (38% higher than in the control) were found in milk fermented by S. thermophilus-L. acidophilus co-culture and supplemented with maltodextrin.
TI  - Potential of selected strains of lactic acid bacteria to induce a Th1 immune profile.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) might switch the Th2 biased immune response in allergic patients towards a balanced Th1/Th2 immune profile, leading to amelioration of allergy. To select strains of LAB that could be of potential application for foods in controlling allergy, 35 bacterial strains were screened in vitro using murine splenocytes and peritoneal exudate cells (PECs). Streptococcus thermophilus AHU1838 (FERM AP-21009), and Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. casei AHU1839 (FERM AP-21010) enhanced the secretion of Th1 cytokines such as interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-12 (IL-12). The two strains of LAB also up-regulated the expression of CD40, and CD86 in dendritic cells (DCs), and activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). These two strains could therefore be used in producing fermented food products that can enhance the Th1 immune profile which is important in ameliorating allergy.
TI  - Utilization of monolinolein as a substrate for conjugated linoleic acid production by Bifidobacterium breve LMC 520 of human neonatal origin.
AB  - This study was designed to isolate bifidobacteria from human intestines that efficiently converts monolinolein, a monoglyceride form of linoleic acid, into conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), as well as to optimize culture conditions for improving CLA production during milk fermentation. Among 150 screened neonatal bifidobacteria, Bifidobacterium breve LMC 520 showed the highest CLA-producing ability and was tested with different types of fat substrates at various concentrations to determine the optimal conditions for CLA production. Monolinolein was tested as a substrate for CLA production. The incubation time optimized for CLA production was 24 h, and CLA production was proportionally increased with monolinolein concentration. The incubation of LMC 520 with commercial starter strains caused minimal reduction in CLA production. Our results demonstrate that the CLA-producing ability of B. breve LMC 520 could offer beneficial effects when utilized as a starter culture for the development of functional dairy products.
TI  - Effects of copper supplement on growth and viability of strains used as starters  and adjunct cultures for Emmental cheese manufacture.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the effects of supplemented copper (Cu2+) on growth and viability of strains used as starters and adjunct cultures for Emmental cheese manufacture. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirteen strains belonging to Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Streptococcus thermophilus or Propionibacterium freudenreichii species were exposed to various copper concentrations in the proper growth medium at relevant growth temperatures, and the effects of supplemented copper on bacterial growth and cell viability were determined by optical density and pH measurements, also by platings. Among the species considered, L. delbrueckii was the most copper resistant and S. thermophilus the most sensitive to copper. Anaerobic conditions increased this sensitivity significantly. There was also a considerable amount of variation in copper resistance at strain level. CONCLUSIONS: Copper resistance is both a species- and strain-dependent property and may reflect variability in copper-binding capacities by cell wall components among species and strains. In addition, the chemical state of copper may be involved. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study revealed that copper resistance is a highly variable property among starter and adjunct strains, and this variability should be considered when strains are selected for Emmental cheese manufacture.
TI  - Multiple interactions between Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii strongly affect their growth kinetics during the making of hard cooked cheeses.
AB  - In hard cooked cheeses, any interactions between the thermophilic starters as they grow during the cheese-making are critical, since they modify bacterial growth kinetics and acidification kinetics, so affecting the ripening process and the final characteristics of the cheese. Twenty-four experimental hard cooked cheeses were made under controlled conditions, the milk being inoculated with various combinations of thermophilic strains of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii. Over the first day of manufacturing we recorded a wide range of different growth kinetics for each starter species used, and a wide range of pH kinetics, depending on the starter combination. Most of the bacterial variability could be statistically explained by the nature, quantity, and/or presence or absence of the different strains inoculated. Four main interactions between the three species were evidenced during cheese-making. There was antagonism between L. helveticus and L. delbrueckii. The lactobacilli had a positive effect on S. thermophilus, which was reciprocal for L. helveticus. L. helveticus had a negative effect on S. thermophilus cultivability. And the combination of S. thermophilus inoculated in large quantities and L. helveticus strain H2 had a negative effect on the growth of the L. delbrueckii strain D2. While the positive effect of L. delbrueckii on S. thermophilus probably corresponds to interactions in milk that have already been described and published, the other interactions were hitherto unknown. These interactions are of major importance for the growth kinetics of streptococci and thermophilic lactobacilli during cheese-making.
TI  - Preventive effect of Streptococcus thermophilus YIT 2001 on dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis in mice.
AB  - We investigated the preventive effect of Streptococcus thermophilus YIT 2001, a lactic acid bacterum having high antioxidative activity, on acute colitis induced by 2.5% dextran sulfate sodium in mice, and compared the effect with that of S. thermophilus YIT 2084 which has lower antioxidative activity. Feeding S. thermophilus YIT 2001 decreased the disease activity index and level of lipid peroxide (the thiobarbituric acid reactive substance content) in the colonic mucosa. The hematocrit and hemoglobin concentrations in the blood of S. thermophilus YIT 2001-fed mice were higher than those of the control mice. S. thermophilus YIT 2084 had no significant effect on these parameters. The results suggest that the antioxidative activity of S. thermophilus YIT 2001 was involved in the improving effect on colitis.
TI  - Short communication: impact of pH and temperature on the acidifying activity of Carnobacterium maltaromaticum.
AB  - The acidifying activity of Carnobacterium maltaromaticum LMA28, a strain isolated from French soft cheese, was studied in trypticase soy broth with yeast extract (TSB-YE) medium and in milk. In TSB-YE supplemented with lactose, glucose, or galactose, lactose and glucose were metabolized with a maximum growth rate of 0.32 h(-1) and galactose was not metabolized. During hydrolysis of lactose, the galactose moiety was not excreted. The major product was l(+) lactic acid, with no significant difference in the lactic acid yield. Glucose was not completely metabolized because cell growth stopped when pH values reached an average of 5.0. In sterilized UHT milk, the addition of 1 g/L of YE enhanced its coagulation. Compared with commercial starter lactic acid bacteria such as Lactococcus lactis DSMZ 20481 or Streptococcus thermophilus INRA 302, Carnobacterium maltaromaticum LMA 28 was shown to be a slow acidifying strain. However, in spite of this weak acidifying ability, C. maltaromaticum LMA 28 can sustain low pH values in coculture with Lc. lactis DSMZ 20481 or S. thermophilus INRA 302. The individual and interactive effects of initial pH values (5.2 to 8.0) and incubation temperatures (23 to 37 degrees C) on acidifying activity were studied by response surface methodology. The 3 strains displayed different behaviors depending on pH and temperature. The psychrotrophic lactic acid strain C. maltaromaticum LMA 28 was able to grow at alkaline pH values and during storage conditions. It could be used as a potential ripening flora in soft cheese.
TI  - Solute carriers (SLC) in inflammatory bowel disease: a potential target of probiotics?
AB  - Transporter proteins of the solute carriers (SLCs) family play a role in epithelial permeability and barrier function in the intestine, and polymorphisms in SLC genes are associated with inflammatory bowel disease. Many SLCs also mediate the bioavailability of pharmaceutical compounds, and the modulation of such transport systems to increase drug efficacy is, therefore, of great interest. We have undertaken a large-scale project to evaluate whether bacteria can modulate the expression of SLCs in the intestine. Here we report the effect of VSL[sharp]3 (a high-potency probiotic preparation) on the expression of 3 large solute carrier families, SLC4, SLC21, and SLC22, which are involved in the transport of bicarbonates, organic anions and cations, and affect the bioavailability of several pharmaceutical compounds. Two groups of animals (VSL[sharp]3 and phosphate-buffered saline controls) were studied for SLC expression in the intestine by Real-Time PCR at the beginning (day 1) and at the end (day 20) of the treatment, and 7 days after the interruption of the treatment. An effect of VSL[sharp]3 administration was detected on the expression of 10% of the studied genes. This reached statistical significance (P=0.01) for the poorly characterized sodium-borate cotransporter SLC4A11, which showed a 5-times lower expression in VSL[sharp]3 than in control mice on day 1 of probiotic treatment. VSL[sharp]3-driven changes in the expression levels of SLC transporters might contribute to its reported effects on intestinal permeability. The elucidation of SLC4A11 function in the intestine will be the key to fully evaluate the relevance of specific findings.
TI  - Use of probiotic bacteria for prevention and therapy of allergic diseases: studies in mouse model of allergic sensitization.
AB  - Probiotic bacteria as modulators of the immune response have been intensively studied in reducing the risk of immune-mediated diseases, including atopic diseases. Results from in vitro studies demonstrated that probiotics may modify the polarization of immune cells, supporting potential therapeutic effects in atopic diseases. Several clinical studies have been designed to explore the effective role of probiotics in the modulation of allergic diseases. The results of these studies, although promising, are not conclusive yet and are considered insufficient to recommend probiotics as a part of standard therapy in any allergic conditions. In vivo studies on animal models can provide useful information on the immunologic mechanisms responsible for the potential antiallergic effects of probiotic bacteria. The immunomodulatory activity of the probiotic mixture VSL#3 has been studied in the mouse models of allergic sensitization and anaphylaxis developed in our laboratory with inhalant and food allergens, according to a prophylactic setting by the intranasal route (inhalant allergy model) or a therapeutic setting by the oral route (food allergy model). Intranasally delivered probiotic bacteria prevented the development of Parietaria major allergen-specific response, by down-regulating T helper cell 2 responses at the local and systemic level. Oral therapeutic treatment was able to reduce both systemic and local anaphylactic symptoms induced by oral challenge with the sensitizing allergen Shrimp Tropomyosin. The induction of protective immune responses at the sites of allergen exposure linked to counterregulatory local and systemic immune responses by mucosal delivery of probiotic bacteria mixtures might become an effective strategy in the prevention and therapy of allergic diseases.
TI  - Use of VSL[sharp]3 in the treatment of rotavirus diarrhea in children: preliminary results.
AB  - We conducted a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study to evaluate efficacy and tolerability of VSL[sharp]3 (CD Pharma India) in the treatment of acute rotavirus diarrhea in children. The patients were randomly assigned to receive 4 days of oral treatment with VSL[sharp]3 probiotic mixture or placebo in addition to usual care for diarrhea. RESULTS: Out of 230 rotavirus-positive acute diarrhea children, 224 children completed the study, (113 in the drug group and 111 in the placebo group). At recruitment on Day 1, there were no significant differences between the 2 groups in terms of frequency of vomiting, mean loose stool frequency, stool consistency, and mean frequency of oral rehydration salts (ORS) and intravenous fluids administered. On Day 2, a lower mean stool frequency and improved stool consistency was noted in the drug group, which achieved statistical significance. This was also reflected in the lower volume of ORS administration in the drug group. Even on Day 3, mean loose stool frequency and frequency of ORS use and frequency of intravenous fluid use was significantly lower in the drug group. The differences in the frequency of loose stools persisted till 8 hours of Day 4. After this, as the placebo group also showed spontaneous improvement the difference between the 2 groups in terms of the overall stools frequency became comparable. However, the overall ORS requirement continued to be significantly lower in the drug group even on Day 4. The overall recovery rates were significantly better in the drug group compared with placebo. No side effects were noted with the use of the probiotic mixture. Use of probiotic mixture VSL[sharp]3 in acute rotavirus diarrhea resulted in earlier recovery and reduced frequency of ORS administration reflecting decreased stool volume losses during diarrhea.
TI  - Physiology of Streptococcus thermophilus during the late stage of milk fermentation with special regard to sulfur amino-acid metabolism.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus is a thermophilic lactic acid bacterium widely used as starter in the manufacture of dairy products in particular in yoghurt manufacture in combination with Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus. However, in spite of its massive use, the physiological state of S. thermophilus in milk has hardly been investigated. We established the first map of the cytosolic proteome of S. thermophilus LMG18311 grown in milk. It comprises 203 identified proteins corresponding to 32% of theoretical proteome. In addition, using proteomic and transcriptomic approaches, we analyzed the physiology of LMG18311 during its late stage of growth in milk (between 2h30 and 5h30). It revealed the up-regulation of (i) peptides and AA transporters and of specific AA biosynthetic pathways notably for sulfur AA and (ii) genes and proteins involved in the metabolism of various sugars. These two effects were also observed in LMG18311 grown in milk in coculture with L. bulgaricus although the effect on sugar metabolism was less pronounced. It suggests that the stimulatory effect of Lactobacillus on the Streptococcus growth is more complex than AA or peptides supply.
TI  - Potentially probiotic bacteria induce efficient maturation but differential cytokine production in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells.
AB  - AIM: To analyze the ability of nine different potentially probiotic bacteria to induce maturation and cytokine production in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs). METHODS: Cytokine production and maturation of moDCs in response to bacterial stimulation was analyzed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and flow cytometric analysis (FACS), respectively. The kinetics of mRNA expression of cytokine genes was determined by Northern blotting. The involvement of different signaling pathways in cytokine gene expression was studied using specific pharmacological signaling inhibitors. RESULTS: All studied bacteria induced the maturation of moDCs in a dose-dependent manner. More detailed analysis with S. thermophilus THS, B. breve Bb99, and L. lactis subsp. cremoris ARH74 indicated that these bacteria induced the expression of moDC maturation markers HLA class II and CD86 as efficiently as pathogenic bacteria. However, these bacteria differed in their ability to induce moDC cytokine gene expression. S. thermophilus induced the expression of pro-inflammatory (TNF-alpha, IL-12, IL-6, and CCL20) and Th1 type (IL-12 and IFN-gamma) cytokines, while B. breve and L. lactis were also potent inducers of anti-inflammatory IL-10. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38, phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI3) kinase, and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling pathways were shown to be involved in bacteria-induced cytokine production. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that potentially probiotic bacteria are able to induce moDC maturation, but their ability to induce cytokine gene expression varies significantly from one bacterial strain to another.
TI  - Growth, proteolytic, and ACE-I activities of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus and rheological properties of low-fat yogurt as influenced by the addition of Raftiline HP.
AB  - This study investigated the influence of incorporating Raftiline HP on the pH, growth, proteolytic, and angiotensin-I converting enzyme inhibitory activities and on spontaneous whey separation, firmness, and rheological properties of low-fat yogurts during storage for 28 d at 4 degrees C. Three types of yogurts were prepared from skim milk containing 0% (YI0, control), 2% (YI2), and 3% (YI3) Raftiline HP, respectively. The incorporation of Raftiline HP improved the growth of starter organisms, particularly that of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, resulting in shorter fermentation time. There was a significant improvement in total proteolysis, which was highest in yogurt containing 3% Raftiline HP. The ACE inhibitory activity was maximal in YI3 compared to YI2 and YI0. Incorporation of Raftiline HP did not affect whey separation and firmness of the low-fat yogurts. All these products were more fluid like with distinct pseudoplastic properties and lesser ability to resist deformation upon applied shear.
TI  - Effect of addition of Versagel on microbial, chemical, and physical properties of low-fat yogurt.
AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the effect of Versagel on the growth and proteolytic activity of Streptococcus thermophilus 1275 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 1368 and angiotensin-I converting enzyme inhibitory activity of the peptides generated thereby as well as on the physical properties of low-fat yogurt during a storage period of 28 d at 4 degrees C. Three different types of low-fat yogurts, YV0, YV1, and YV2, were prepared using Versagel as a fat replacer. The fermentation time of the low-fat yogurts containing Versagel was less than that of the control yogurt (YV0). The starter cultures maintained their viability (8.68 to 8.81 log CFU/g of S. thermophilus and 8.51 to 8.81 log CFU/g of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus) in all the yogurts throughout the storage period. There was some decrease in the pH of the yogurts during storage and an increase in the concentration of lactic acid. However, the proteolytic and ACE-inhibitory potential of the starter cultures was suppressed in the presence of Versagel. On the other hand, the addition of Versagel had a positive impact on the physical properties of the low-fat yogurt, namely, spontaneous whey separation, firmness, and pseudoplastic properties.
TI  - Growth kinetics on oligo- and polysaccharides and promising features of three antioxidative potential probiotic strains.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the antioxidative activity, glutathione production, acid and bile tolerance and carbohydrate preferences of Lactobacillus plantarum LP 1, Streptococcus thermophilus Z 57 and Bifidobacterium lactis B 933. METHODS AND RESULTS: The intact bacteria exhibited antioxidative capacity against linolenic acid and ascorbate oxidation. The antioxidative activity of cell-free extracts was determined by chemiluminescent assay and agreed with total glutathione content. Superoxide dismutase was negligible in all the strains. Bile and gastric juice resistance was tested in vitro to estimate the transit tolerance in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Bifidobacterium lactis B 933 and L. plantarum LP 1 were more acid tolerant than S. thermophilus Z 57. All the strains were resistant to bile. Among 13 indigestible carbohydrates, galacto-oligosaccharides and fructo-oligosaccharides were utilized by all the strains and did not affect survival in human gastric juice. CONCLUSIONS: These potential probiotic strains exhibited antioxidative properties and good viability in gastric juice and bile may indicate tolerance to the transit through the upper gastrointestinal tract. Galacto-oligosaccharides and fructo-oligosaccharides are the most appropriate prebiotics to be used in effective synbiotic formulations. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These results outline promising strains with antioxidative properties. Carbohydrate preferences can be exploited in order to develop synbiotic products.
TI  - Clinical trial: effect of active lactic acid bacteria on mucosal barrier function in patients with diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The intestinal permeability is increased in patients with diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (D-IBS). AIM: To determine the possible efficacy of lactic acid bacteria on the increased intestinal permeability in D-IBS. METHODS: Treatment was employed for 4 weeks in a randomized single blind placebo controlled study with 30 D-IBS patients. Patients were given either probiotic fermented milk (Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium Longum) or milk beverage containing no bacteria. The clinical symptoms were scored and intestinal permeability was measured by a triple sugar test before and after treatment. RESULTS: Small bowel permeability was measured as the ratio of lactulose and mannitol recovery and colonic permeability was measured as the total mass of sucralose excretion (mg). After probiotics treatment, small bowel permeability decreased significantly from 0.038 (0.024) at baseline to 0.023 (0.020) (P = 0.004), the proportion of patients with increased small bowel permeability was lower than baseline (28.6% vs. 64.3%, P = 0.023). However, colonic permeability improved neither in the probiotics group nor in the placebo group at week 4. Treatment with probiotics significantly decreased the mean global IBS scores compared with the baseline scores (9.62 +/- 1.05 vs. 7.64 +/- 1.24, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Short-term active lactic acid bacteria treatment for D-IBS improved mucosal barrier function.
TI  - The effects of probiotics on PPI-triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori eradication.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was performed to evaluate whether the addition of probiotics to proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-based triple therapy increases the likelihood of successful Helicobacter pylori eradication. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three hundred and forty-seven H. pylori-infected patients were randomized into a triple-plus-yogurt group (yogurt group, n = 168) or a triple-only group (control group, n = 179). Triple therapy consisted of PPI b.i.d., clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d., and amoxicillin 1 g b.i.d. for 7 days. Yogurt group received triple therapy for 1 week and one bottle of Will yogurt per day for at 3 weeks, starting on the first day of triple therapy. Will yogurt (a Korean brand) contains Lactobacillus acidophilus HY2177, Lactobacillus casei HY2743, Bifidobacterium longum HY8001, and Streptococcus thermophilus B-1. (13)C-urea breath test was performed at least 4 weeks after completion of triple therapy. Eradication rates, compliances, and adverse events were compared. RESULTS: By intention-to treat analysis the H. pylori eradication rates in the yogurt group 79.2% (133 of 168) was similar to that in the control group 72.1% (129 of 179) (p = .124). However, by per-protocol (PP) analysis, the eradication rate in the yogurt group, 87.5% (133 of 152) was higher than that in the control group, 78.7% (129 of 164) (p = .037). Common adverse events were metallic taste (11.8%) and diarrhea (8.6%). The frequency of adverse effects in the yogurt group 41.1% (69/168) were higher than in the control group, 26.3% (47 of 179) (p = .003). However, most adverse events were mild to moderate in intensity, and the severities of adverse effects were similar in both groups (p = .401). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of Will yogurt to triple therapy did not reduce the side-effects of triple therapy. But it increased the H. pylori eradication rate by PP analysis, encouraging more research in this field.
TI  - Polyphasic approach to bacterial dynamics during the ripening of Spanish farmhouse cheese, using culture-dependent and -independent methods.
AB  - We studied the dynamics of the microbial population during ripening of Cueva de la Magaha cheese using a combination of classical and molecular techniques. Samples taken during ripening of this Spanish goat's milk cheese in which Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus were used as starter cultures were analyzed. All bacterial isolates were clustered by using randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, species-specific PCR, and multiplex PCR. Our results indicate that the majority of the 225 strains isolated and enumerated on solid media during the ripening period were nonstarter lactic acid bacteria, and Lactobacillus paracasei was the most abundant species. Other Lactobacillus species, such as Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus parabuchneri, were also detected at the beginning and end of ripening, respectively. Non-lactic-acid bacteria, mainly Kocuria and Staphylococcus strains, were also detected at the end of the ripening period. Microbial community dynamics determined by temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis provided a more precise estimate of the distribution of bacteria and enabled us to detect Lactobacillus curvatus and the starter bacteria S. thermophilus and L. lactis, which were not isolated. Surprisingly, the bacterium most frequently found using culture-dependent analysis, L. paracasei, was scarcely detected by this molecular approach. Finally, we studied the composition of the lactobacilli and their evolution by using length heterogeneity PCR.
TI  - Diversity of Firmicutes peptidoglycan hydrolases and specificities of those involved in daughter cell separation.
AB  - Within Streptococcus thermophilus, Cse was identified as the major cell disconnecting peptidoglycan hydrolase (PGH) and was demonstrated to be species-specific. To identify cell disconnecting PGHs encoded by other Streptococcus genomes, we explored the diversity of domains carried by Firmicutes PGHs, and especially that of enzymes involved in daughter cell separation. This work brings to light the diversity of PGHs and reveals that each species recruits its own cell-separating enzyme distinct from that of the others. This specificity is probably correlated with the diversity of substrates found in the bacterial cell wall.
TI  - Microbiological, chemical, and sensory characteristics of Swiss cheese manufactured with adjunct Lactobacillus strains using a low cooking temperature.
AB  - The effect of nonstarter Lactobacillus adjunct cultures on the microbial, chemical, and sensory characteristics of Swiss cheese manufactured using the "kosher make procedure" was investigated. The kosher make procedure, which uses a lower cooking temperature than traditional Swiss cheese making, is used by many American cheese manufacturers to allow for kosher-certified whey. Cheeses were manufactured using a commercial starter culture combination and 1 of 3 non-starter Lactobacillus strains previously isolated from Swiss cheeses, Lactobacillus casei A26, L. casei B21, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus H2, as an adjunct. Control cheeses lacked the adjunct culture. Cheeses were analyzed during ripening for microbial and chemical composition. Adjunct strain L. casei A26, which utilized citrate most readily in laboratory medium, dominated the Lactobacillus population within 30 d, faster than the other adjunct cultures. There were no significant differences in Propionibacterium counts, Streptococcus thermophilus counts, protein, fat, moisture, salt, and pH among the cheeses. Free amino acid concentration ranged from 5 to 7 mmol/100 g of cheese at 90 d of ripening and was adjunct strain dependent. Lactic, acetic, and propionic acid concentrations were not significantly different among the cheeses after a 90-d ripening period; however differences in propionic acid concentrations were apparent at 60 d, with the cheeses made with L. casei adjuncts containing less propionic acid. Citric acid was depleted by the end of warm room ripening in cheeses manufactured with adjunct L. casei strains, but not with adjunct L. rhamnosus. Cheeses made with L. casei A26 were most similar to the control cheeses in diacetyl and butyric/isobutyric acid abundance as evaluated by electronic nose during the first 3 mo of ripening. The 4 cheese types differed in their descriptive sensory profiles at 8 mo of age, indicating an adjunct strain-dependent effect on particular flavor attributes. Adjunct Lactobacillus spp. affected the flavor profile and concentration of some flavor compounds in Swiss cheeses produced with the kosher make procedure. Use of adjunct Lactobacillus cultures provides Swiss cheese makers using a low cooking temperature with a means to control the dominant Lactobacillus strain during ripening, reduce citrate concentration, and modify cheese flavor.
TI  - Therapeutic potential of two probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease as observed in the trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid model of colitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease is thought to be a multifactorial process. One of the leading hypotheses is that an imbalance in normal gut flora induces an excessive immune response and contributes to inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. Administration of probiotic bacteria reduces symptoms in patients suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases, probably via both manipulation of the microflora and stimulation of the intestinal immune system. In the current study the therapeutic potential of two different probiotics-Lactobacillus GG and a mixture of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium longum (YO-MIX Y 109 FRO 1000)--in a rat model of colitis were evaluated. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were administered probiotics for three days simultaneously with colitis induction. Colonic damage was evaluated histologically and biochemically and colonic tissues, as well as fecal samples, were used for bacterial studies using 16S rRNA gene primers. RESULTS: Probiotics administration reduced the relative amounts of the pathogenic bacteria Aeromonas and Escherichia coli in the colonic tissue. However, whereas both probiotics affected colon morphology, only Lactobacillus GG administration reduced myeloperoxidase activity. CONCLUSIONS: We report the therapeutic rather than preventive potential of two different probiotics in an animal model of colitis.
TI  - Grana Padano cheese whey starters: microbial composition and strain distribution.
AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the species composition and the genotypic strain heterogeneity of dominant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from whey starter cultures used to manufacture Grana Padano cheese. Twenty-four Grana Padano cheese whey starters collected from dairies located over a wide geographic production area in the north of Italy were analyzed. Total thermophilic LAB streptococci and lactobacilli were quantified by agar plate counting. Population structure of the dominant and metabolically active LAB species present in the starters was profiled by reverse transcriptase, length heterogeneity-PCR (RT-LH-PCR), a culture-independent technique successfully applied to study whey starter ecosystems. The dominant bacterial species were Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Lactobacillus fermentum. Diversity in the species composition allowed the whey cultures to be grouped into four main typologies, the one containing L. helveticus, L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, and S. thermophilus being the most frequent one (45% of the cultures analyzed), followed by that containing only the two lactobacilli (40%). Only a minor fraction of the cultures contained L. helveticus alone (4%) or all the four LAB species (11%). Five hundred and twelve strains were isolated from the 24 cultures and identified by M13-PCR fingerprinting coupled with 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Most of the strains were L. helveticus (190 strains; 37% of the total), L delbrueckii subsp. lactis (90 strains; 18%) and S. thermophilus (215 strains; 42%). This result was in good agreement with the qualitative whey starter composition observed by RT-LH-PCR. M13-PCR fingerprinting indicated a markedly low infra-species diversity, i.e. the same biotypes were often found in more than one culture. The distribution of the biotypes into the different cultures was mainly dairy plant-specific rather than correlated with the different production areas.
TI  - Molecular methods for identification of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus using methionine biosynthesis and 16S rRNA genes.
AB  - Yoghurt and starter culture producers are still searching strains of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus to produce healthier yogurt with longer shelf life, better texture, taste and quality. However, selective identification of Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Strep. thermophilus from a mixed population using microbiological and biochemical methods is difficult, time consuming and may not be accurate. In this study, a quick, sensitive and accurate method is proposed to identify both Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Strep. thermophilus using PCR. The method is comprised of two parts. In the first part, methionine biosynthesis genes, known to be present in both species were partially amplified by designed primers (cysmet2F and cysmet2R). Partial amplification of the methionine biosynthesis gene which gives 700 bp fragment resulted in selective identification of Lb. bulgaricus and Strep. thermophilus. All 16 Lb. bulgaricus and 6 Strep. thermophilus isolates assessed by this method gave the expected amplification. On the other hand, further analysis of other closely related species with the same primers have indicated that the same product was also amplified in two more lactobacilli namely, Lb. delbrueckii subsp. lactis and Lb. helveticus species. Thus, in the second part of the method, further differentiation of Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Strep. thermophilus from each other and these species was achieved using restriction analysis of 16S rRNA gene with EcoRI.
TI  - Determination of volatile and non-volatile products of milk fermentation processes using capillary zone electrophoresis and solid phase microextraction coupled to gas chromatography.
AB  - The aim of the investigations was to develop analytical methods for the determination of selected volatile and non-volatile organic compounds numbering among the final products of milk fermentation. The analyzed compounds were as follows: biacetyl and carboxylic acids (formic, acetic, citric, and lactic). The model yogurt was prepared under controlled conditions in our laboratory by addition of the selected bacteria (Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus) to the milk sample. The temperature, time, and stirring were controlled during the fermentation process. Factors considered in SPMPE-GC-FID method development included fiber exposure time, salt addition, temperature of extraction, and temperature of desorption. Various SPME fibers, for example with PDMS, CAR/PDMS, PA, and PDMS/DVB coatings, were tested to obtain the highest recovery of the investigated compounds extracted from yogurt samples. Based on these preliminary experiments, qualitative and quantitative analyses for the determination of biacetyl were performed by SPME-GC-FID. Moreover, a capillary zone electrophoresis method was developed for the determination of carboxylic acids in the yogurt samples. The buffer composition as well as deproteinization by acetonitrile were found to have a crucial effect on the analysis.
TI  - Rerouting of pyruvate metabolism during acid adaptation in Lactobacillus bulgaricus.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) gradually acidify their environment through the conversion of pyruvate to lactate, an essential process to regenerate NAD(+) used during glycolysis. A clear demonstration of acidification can be found in yogurt, the product of milk fermentation by the LAB Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (L. bulgaricus) and Streptococcus thermophilus, where the pH falls to 4.2. Acid adaptation therefore plays an important role in the physiology of LAB. Here we present the results of a proteomic approach to reveal cellular changes associated with acid adaptation in L. bulgaricus. These results were complemented with transcription data for selected genes to show three major effects: (i) induction of the chaperones GroES, GroEL, HrcA, GrpE, DnaK, DnaJ, ClpE, ClpP, and ClpL, and the repression of ClpC; (ii) induction of genes involved in the biosynthesis of fatty acids (fabH, accC, fabI); (iii) repression of genes involved in the mevalonate pathway of isoprenoid synthesis (mvaC, mvaS). Together with changes in the expression of other genes from the local metabolic network, these results for the first time show a coherent picture of changes in gene expression expected to result in a rerouting of pyruvate metabolism to favor fatty acid biosynthesis, and thereby affect membrane fluidity.
TI  - Antibacterial action of selenium-enriched probiotics against pathogenic Escherichia coli.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the inhibitory activity of selenium-enriched probiotics against pathogenic Escherichia coli (E. coli) in vitro and in vivo. Escherichia coli was co-cultured in vitro with each probiotic strain individually, and a mixture of the four strains and its population was counted at various time points. We also collected a cell-free culture supernatant (CFCS) of each probiotic strain and the four-strain mix to examine their antibacterial activity, using the cylinder plate method. Results demonstrated that co-culture with probiotics significantly reduced the number of E. coli. The different sizes of the inhibition zones made by each CFCS proved that E. coli was inhibited by the metabolites of the probiotics. In vivo, Kunming mice were allocated to different groups supplemented with selenium-enriched and other probiotics. After 28 days, the mice were inoculated with pathogenic E. coli so that we could compare mortality rates and inspect other indexes of each treatment. The mortality of the group with selenium-enriched probiotics was the lowest. In addition, the organic antioxidant status improved, immunity was fortified, and the internal environment of the intestinal tract was enhanced with selenium-enriched probiotic supplementation. In conclusion, selenium-enriched probiotics can strongly antagonize pathogenic E. coli in vitro and in vivo.
TI  - Growth and activity of Bulgarian yogurt starter culture in iron-fortified milk.
AB  - Bulgarian yogurts were manufactured and fortified with 8, 15 and 27 mg of iron kg(-1) of yogurt. The growth and acidifying activity of the starter culture bacteria Streptococcus thermophilus 13a and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 2-11 were monitored during milk fermentation and over 15 days of yogurt storage at 4 degrees C. Fortifying milk with iron did not affect significantly the growth of the starter culture during manufacture and storage of yogurt. Counts of yogurt bacteria at the end of fermentation of iron-fortified milks were between 2.1 x 10(10) and 4.6 x 10(10) CFU ml(-1), which were not significantly different from numbers in unfortified yogurts. In all batches of yogurt, the viable cell counts of S. thermophilus 13a were approximately three times higher than those of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 2-11. Greater decrease in viable cell count over 15 days of storage was observed for S. thermophilus 13a compared to L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 2-11. Intensive accumulation of lactic acid was observed during incubation of milk and all batches reached pH 4.5 +/- 0.1 after 3.0 h. At the end of fermentation process, lactic acid concentrations in iron-fortified yogurts were between 6.9 +/- 0.4 and 7.3 +/- 0.5 g l(-1). The acidifying activity of starter culture bacteria in the control and iron-fortified milks was similar. There was no increase in oxidized, metallic and bitter off-flavors in iron-fortified yogurts compared to the control. Iron-fortified yogurts did not differ significantly in their sensorial, chemical and microbiological characteristics with unfortified yogurt, suggesting that yogurt is a suitable vehicle for iron fortification and that the ferrous lactate is an appropriate iron source for yogurt fortification.
TI  - Effect of infant formula with probiotics on intestinal microbiota.
AB  - Weaning during infancy refers to the initiation of complementary food to breast milk. During weaning, there are significant changes on the gastrointestinal microbiota. Deleterious alterations of the gastrointestinal microbiota can result in pathological processes while measures that stimulate its development and stability, like the use of probiotics, are beneficial. The mechanisms by which probiotics achieve their effects have not been clearly established. Present work compares the microbial composition of feces from infants that were weaned to regular family food, formula with probiotics (B. Lactis BL y S. Thermophilus) or formula without probiotics. Accordingly, analysis of rDNA of microbial fecal samples by molecular techniques was used. Formula with or without probiotics was well tolerated and safe for all participating children. Probiotics present in formula were viable and susceptible to culture. There was not difference on physical growth or development among all participants. The microbiota of children supplemented with formula with- or without probiotics was different than that observed in children supplemented with regular food. It was not possible to determine enrichment of B. Lactis BL and S. Thermophilus in the feces of children that consumed the probiotics. Present work contributes to the understanding of probiotics effects in human health.
TI  - Microflora of Feta cheese from four Greek manufacturers.
AB  - The components of the microflora of four Feta cheeses, produced by different Greek manufacturers, were determined by culture dependent and independent techniques. Isolates from microbiological media were first grouped by Polymerase Chain Reaction-Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) and then representatives of each DGGE group were sequenced for identification purposes. DNA and RNA, extracted directly from the cheese, were subjected to PCR-DGGE. Moreover, Feta cheeses were subjected to FISH analysis in order to identify viable bacterial populations. The microbial ecology, as represented by the Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) and yeast populations, was different for the four cheeses. The main LAB species isolated were Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus coryniformis and Lactobacillus fermentum. However, some inconsistencies were observed between the results obtained with the culture dependent and the culture independent approach. In the case of the yeasts, the results obtained by PCR-DGGE compared very well with those obtained by the conventional microbiological analysis and the main species found were Kluyveromyces lactis, Pichia fermentans and C. zeylanoides. FISH analysis highlighted viable but not culturable populations of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactococcus spp. RAPD-PCR performed on the L. plantarum isolates revealed a cheese specific distribution and a temperature dependent clustering.
TI  - Fate and effects of Camembert cheese micro-organisms in the human colonic microbiota of healthy volunteers after regular Camembert consumption.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine i) if Camembert cheese micro-organisms could be detected in fecal samples after regular consumption by human subjects and ii) the consequence of this consumption on global metabolic activities of the host colonic microbiota. An open human protocol was designed where 12 healthy volunteers were included: a 2-week period of fermented products exclusion followed by a 4-weeks Camembert ingestion period where 2x40 g/day of Camembert cheese was consumed. Stools were collected from the volunteers before consumption, twice during the ingestion period (2nd and 4th week) and once after a wash out period of 2 weeks. During the consumption of Camembert cheese, high levels of Lactococcus lactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides were measured in fecal samples using real-time quantitative PCR, reaching median values of 8.2 and 7.5 Log(10) genome equivalents/g of stool. For Ln. mesenteroides, persistence was observed 15 days after the end of Camembert consumption. The survival of Geotrichum candidum was also assessed and the fecal concentration reached a median level of 7.1 Log(10) CFU/g in stools. Except a decreasing trend of the nitrate reductase activity, no significant modification was shown in the metabolic activities during this study.
TI  - Modelling the survival of starter lactic acid bacteria and Bifidobacterium bifidum in single and simultaneous cultures.
AB  - The inactivation kinetics at 4 degrees C of Bifidobacterium bifidum, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus, cultured alone or consociated in a laboratory medium (modified MRS broth), were modelled through the Weibull model and a second-order polynomial equation. The initial cell number of S. thermophilus and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus was approximately 6-7log (CFU/ml); the viability loss after 30 days of storage was 2.87 and 1.99log (CFU/l) for L. delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus, cultured alone, respectively; whereas the consociation of lactobacilli and streptococci with bifidobacteria reduced viability loss during storage (0.28 and 0.54log CFU/l for lactobacilli and streptococci, respectively). Finally, the consociation of lactobacilli and streptococci with B. bifidum improved their oxygen uptake.
TI  - Streptococcus thermophilus core genome: comparative genome hybridization study of 47 strains.
AB  - A DNA microarray platform based on 2,200 genes from publicly available sequences  was designed for Streptococcus thermophilus. We determined how single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the 65- to 75-mer oligonucleotide probe sequences affect the hybridization signals. The microarrays were then used for comparative genome hybridization (CGH) of 47 dairy S. thermophilus strains. An analysis of the exopolysaccharide genes in each strain confirmed previous findings that this class of genes is indeed highly variable. A phylogenetic tree based on the CGH data showed similar distances for most strains, indicating frequent recombination or gene transfer within S. thermophilus. By comparing genome sizes estimated from the microarrays and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, the amount of unknown DNA in each strain was estimated. A core genome comprised of 1,271 genes detected in all 47 strains was identified. Likewise, a set of noncore genes detected in only some strains was identified. The concept of an industrial core genome is proposed. This is comprised of the genes in the core genome plus genes that are necessary in an applied industrial context.
TI  - Multiplex fast real-time PCR for quantitative detection and identification of cos- and pac-type Streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophages.
AB  - The fermentation of milk by Streptococcus thermophilus is a widespread industrial process that is susceptible to bacteriophage attack. In this work, a preventive fast real-time PCR method for the detection, quantification, and identification of types of S. thermophilus phages in 30 min is described.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of yoghurt against viridans streptococci in vitro.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Yoghurt consumption leads to a selective decrease in the oral level of mutans streptococci. It is not clear whether this decrease is due to the bactericidal activity of yoghurt or other mechanisms. The present study investigated the differences in susceptibility to yoghurt between several strains of viridans streptococci. DESIGN: The sources of variation were minimised, at the expense of the external validity of the study, using culture collection strains. Each strain was tested separately on five occasions in planktonic form and logarithmic growth phase. Two strains of each of the following Streptococcus species were tested: mutans, sobrinus, gordonii, oralis, parasanguinis and sanguinis. One millilitre [10(8) colony-forming units (cfu)] of each strain was incubated (37 degrees C, 60min) with 9mL of fat-free plain yoghurt containing Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus (10(8) and 10(7)cfu/g, respectively) in gently vortexed tubes. Survival rates were calculated every 15min by dividing the number of viable cells, obtained using conventional laboratory procedures, by the baseline number. RESULTS: Survival rates were 8% (S. mutans 6519T), 12% (S. mutans 31738), 35% (S. oralis 25671) and >50% (all other species tested) after 15min, and 0.01% (S. mutans) and >10% (all other species tested) after 30min. Overall, S. parasanguinis and S. sobrinus were the most resistant species. When heat-treated yoghurt (<10cfu/g bacteria and inactivated bacteriocins) was used, this antibacterial activity was not found. CONCLUSION: In vitro, yoghurt with live bacteria showed selective anti-mutans activity, suggesting that the overall decrease in mutans streptococci in vivo could be due to a bactericidal effect on S. mutans but not on S. sobrinus.
TI  - Selection and use of autochthonous multiple strain cultures for the manufacture of high-moisture traditional Mozzarella cheese.
AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum 18A, Lactobacillus helveticus 2B, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis 20F, Streptococcus thermophilus 22C, Enterococcus faecalis 32C and Enterococcus durans 16E were the most acidifying strains within 146 isolates for natural whey starters. The effect of media and temperature on 2 autochthonous multiple strain cultures (AMSI: 18A, 2B, 20F and 22C, 32C and 16E and AMSII: 18A, 2B, 20F and 22C) was studied. Genomic analysis showed a constant cell numbers for AMSII during 16 days of propagation in whey milk. Mozzarella cheese was made by using AMSII, commercial starter (CS) or citric acid (DA). Compared to other cheeses, the DA had a lower level of protein, ash, Ca, free amino acids and a higher level of moisture. Based on confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis, AMSII cheese showed the lowest microstructural variations during the period of storage compared to other cheeses. All the sensory attributes were scored highest for AMSII cheese. ASMII extend the shelf-life to ca. 12-15 days instead of the 5-7 days of traditional high-moisture Mozzarella cheese.
TI  - Probiotics for children with diarrhea: an update.
AB  - This review focuses on the efficacy of probiotics for diarrhea in children in different settings: day-care centers, diarrhea acquired in the hospital, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and treatment of acute infectious diarrhea. For prevention of diarrhea acquired in day-care centers, 5 randomized and placebo-controlled trials have been published. Probiotics tested were Lactobacillus GG, Bifidobacterium lactis (alone or in combination with Streptococcus thermophilus), and Lactobacillus reuteri. The evidence of their efficacy in these settings is only modest: statistically significant for some strains only and in any case of minimal to mild clinical importance. Few trials have examined the potential role of probiotics in preventing the spread of diarrhea in hospitalized children, an event most commonly due to either rotavirus or Clostridium difficile, and they have yielded conflicting results. Overall, these studies provide only weak evidence on the efficacy of probiotics. On the other hand, a large number of trials on the role of probiotics in preventing the onset of antibiotic-associated diarrhea have been published. Most commonly employed probiotics were Lactobacillus GG, Bifidobacterium spp., Streptococcus spp., and the yeast Saccharomyces boulardii. In general, these trials do show clear evidence of efficacy, with the 2 most effective strains being Lactobacillus GG and S. boulardii. Today, we have a large number of published clinical trials on the role of probiotics in treating sporadic infectious diarrhea in children, and many of them are randomized, blinded, and controlled. They consistently show a statistically significant benefit and moderate clinical benefit of a few, well-identified probiotic strains-mostly Lactobacillus GG and S. boulardii, but also L. reuteri-in the treatment of acute watery diarrhea, primarily rotaviral, in infants and young children of developed countries. Such a beneficial effect seems to result in a reduction of diarrhea duration of little more than 1 day, and to be exerted mostly on diarrhea due to rotavirus. The effect is not only strain-dependent, but also dose-dependent, with doses of at least 10 billion/d being necessary.
TI  - Production of the exopolysaccharides by Streptococcus thermophilus: effect of growth conditions on fermentation kinetics and intrinsic viscosity.
AB  - Production of exopolysaccharides (EPS) by a commercial Streptococcus thermophilus strain was evaluated at different growth conditions [temperature (32-45 degrees C), carbon source and initial nitrogen (N) content]. Lactose from deproteinized whey and sucrose allowed to obtain EPS yields higher than 1200 mg/mM of the consumed carbon source. Intrinsic viscosity of the EPS was significantly reduced by ionic strength indicating a polyelectrolyte behavior. Growth conditions used for the production of the EPS had a significant effect (p<0.05) on the intrinsic viscosity. This was attributed to the effect of growth conditions on the molecular properties of the EPS [stiffness and molecular weight (MW)]. High MW EPS were produced when the bacteria grew at a high specific growth rate; however MW of the EPS and specific growth rate were not linearly associated. In the lactose fermentations carried out at different temperatures specific EPS synthesis rate was positive and linearly associated with the specific lactose consumption rate (R2=0.967) and specific galactose production rate (R2=0.967). Critical coil overlap parameter, [eta]C*, for the EPS produced in the lactose fermentations carried out at 43 and 45 degrees C was determined to be approximately 7.6, and their critical overlap concentrations (C*) were 0.45 and 0.87 g/dL, respectively.
TI  - Microbial diversity in natural whey cultures used for the production of Caciocavallo Silano PDO cheese.
AB  - The microbial diversity of sixty-three Natural Whey Cultures (NWCs) for the manufacture of Caciocavallo Silano cheese PDO was studied. The NWCs were collected from different dairies covering the whole territory of PDO production including five different regions of southern Italy. The microbial species diversity was determined by direct DNA extraction from NWCs and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification of variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene followed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC). DGGE and DHPLC fingerprinting yielded the same results in terms of number of bands/peaks and specific migration/retention time of the amplicons. The DHPLC technique was used in this study for the first time to assess a food-related mixed microbial community by a culture-independent approach and proved to be at least as effective as DGGE in profiling species diversity in NWCs. Cluster analysis of DGGE and DHPLC data revealed that the species-related groups of similarity were not dependent on the geographical origin of the NWCs. The presence of three groups of 10-14 NWCs at 100% of species similarity indicated that some species associations are very commonly occurring in the NWCs for Caciocavallo Silano cheese PDO. A RAPD-PCR analysis of the NWCs was also performed for the members of the above groups and it showed that, though characterized by the same species diversity, most of the identical NWCs included different biotypes. The sequences of DGGE bands and DHPLC peaks revealed the occurrence of mainly thermophilic lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus delbrueckii, L. helveticus and Streptococcus thermophilus even though the mesophilic Lactococcus lactis also occurred in some NWCs. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that the microbial diversity of NWCs used for the Caciocavallo Silano PDO cheese is not high, it is not dependent on the geographical origin and the same microbial species occur within the territory examined. The microbiota of fermented PDO products and its possible link with territory should be studied case by case in order to have useful evidences for the assessment of product quality and authenticity.
TI  - Yoghurts containing probiotics reduce disruption of the small intestinal barrier  in methotrexate-treated rats.
AB  - Small intestinal permeability was employed to assess the efficacy of commercially available yoghurts containing probiotics in a rat model of methotrexate (MTX)-induced mucositis. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were allocated to four groups (n = 8): MTX + water, MTX + cow's milk yoghurt (CY; fermented with Lactobacillus johnsonii), MTX + sheep's milk yoghurt (SY; containing Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus), and saline. Treatment gavage occurred twice daily for 7 days pre-MTX and 5 days post-MTX. Intestinal permeability was assessed on days -7, -1, 2, and 5 of the trial. Intestinal sections were collected at sacrifice for histological and biochemical analyses. Histology revealed that rats receiving CY and SY did not have a significantly damaged duodenum compared to controls. However, an improved small intestinal barrier function was evident, determined by a decreased lactulose/mannitol ratio. Probiotics containing SY and CY may be useful in preventing disruption to intestinal barrier function in MTX-induced mucositis.
TI  - Diversity of stress responses in dairy thermophilic streptococci.
AB  - Exponential and stationary phase cells of 56 strains of the dairy Streptococcus species S. thermophilus, S. macedonicus and S. salivarius, were exposed to acid, osmotic, oxidative and heat stresses to investigate the diversity of their responses. Three strains of dairy related streptococci, Lactococcus lactis ATCC11454, Enterococcus faecium DSM20477 and Enterococcus faecalis DSM20478, were included for comparison purposes. Acid and heat adaptation and cross-protection to stress were studied in ten strains with different stress response patterns. Cell death and the changes in protein expression were evaluated by plate counts and Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Polyacrilamide Gel Electrophoresis, respectively. All strains of all species were highly tolerant of osmotic stress. With a few exceptions, acid and oxidative treatments reduced the number of viable cells by >5 log units but responses to heat stress were more variable. For some, but not all strains, stationary phase cells were more resistant to some or all stresses. Matrix cluster analysis was used to group strains on the basis of their pattern of stress response in seven clusters. Significant associations between the sources of strains and stress resistance were found for acid and oxidative stresses. Adaptation to stress during the exponential phase enhanced the survival of acid and heat stressed cells from 1 to 60,000-folds, but a detrimental effect of adaptation on cell viability was evident for oxidative and osmotic stresses for three strains. Adaptation and entry into the stationary phase resulted in significant changes of protein bands whose estimated molecular masses corresponded with those of proteins (DnaK, GprE, GroEL, and GroES) involved in the general stress response but no statistically significant correlation between stress response and band intensity was evident.
TI  - A double blind randomized controlled trial of a probiotic combination in 100 patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a probiotic  combination on symptoms in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). METHODS: We investigated the efficiency of a probiotic dietary supplement, containing four strains of lactic acid bacteria, on symptoms of IBS. One hundred and sixteen patients with IBS fulfilling the Rome II criteria were randomized in a parallel group, double-blind study to receive a placebo or a probiotic combination (1 x 10(10) cfu once daily) for four weeks. The symptoms that were monitored weekly included discomfort, abdominal pain, and stool frequency and quality. Quality of life was assessed before and at the end of the treatment using the SF36 and FDD-quality-of-life questionnaires. RESULTS: One hundred subjects completed the study (48 probiotic combination, 52 placebo). The probiotic combination was not superior to the placebo in relieving symptoms of IBS (42.6 versus 42.3% improvement). However, the decrease of abdominal pain between the first and the fourth week of treatment was significantly higher in probiotic treated patients (-41.9 versus -24.2%, P=0.048). Interesting findings from the IBS sub-groups were also observed such as a lower pain score at end point in patients with alternating bowel habits (P=0.023) and an increase of stool frequency in the constipated sub-group from the first week of probiotic treatment (P=0.043). CONCLUSIONS: The probiotic combination was not significantly superior to the placebo in relieving symptoms of IBS. Despite the apparent high placebo response, interesting findings from IBS sub-groups were observed in the field of abdominal pain and stool frequency.
TI  - Phytosterol effects on milk and yogurt microflora.
AB  - Phytosterols play a major role in functional foods. Their ability to reduce serum cholesterol in humans has been widely proven and they are now being added to various dairy based products. The present study investigated the potential antimicrobial activity of phytosterols in milk and their effect on yogurt starter cultures. A commercial phytosterol (0.26% to 1.8%, w/v) preparation (CPP) consisting of ss-sitosterol, campesterol, sitostanol, and campestanol had no effect on the standard plate count (SPC) and psychrotroph population in pasteurized milk stored at 4 degrees C. In addition, a challenge study employing Pseudomonas spp. in milk at 4 to 7 degrees C confirmed that the CPP was not antimicrobial. However, the addition of a dispersible CPP consisting of 0.72% phytosterol containing 0.02% to 0.03% sodium stearoyl lactylate (SSL) did appear to affect the SPC and psychrotrophic bacteria in refrigerated milk. The dispersible preparations did not, however, inhibit the growth of Pseudomonas. An investigation into the antimicrobial activity of SSL revealed that it alone had no effect on the SPC in milk. The CPP had no effect on growth and acid development by Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus during yogurt production at 33 degrees C and storage at 4 degrees C for 30 d. This is seen as a beneficial feature since growth and acid development by these organisms are crucial for yogurt quality. Saccaromyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus ochraceous added to yogurt as typical contaminants also were not inhibited. While the CCP was somewhat antimicrobial when formulated with dispersing agents, it otherwise had no antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Serine hydroxymethyl transferase from Streptococcus thermophilus and L-threonine  aldolase from Escherichia coli as stereocomplementary biocatalysts for the synthesis of beta-hydroxy-alpha,omega-diamino acid derivatives.
AB  - A novel serine hydroxymethyl transferase from Streptococcus thermophilus (SHMT) and a L-threonine aldolase from Escherichia coli (LTA) were used as stereocomplementary biocatalysts for the aldol addition of glycine to N-Cbz amino aldehydes and benzyloxyacetaldehyde (Cbz=benzyloxycarbonyl). Both threonine aldolases were classified as low-specific L-allo-threonine aldolases, and by manipulating reaction parameters, such as temperature, glycine concentration, and reaction media, SHMT yielded exclusively L-erythro diastereomers in 34-60 % conversion, whereas LTA gave L-threo diastereomers in 30:70 to 16:84 diastereomeric ratios and with 40-68 % conversion to product. SHMT is among the most stereoselective L-threonine aldolases described. This is due, among other things, to its activity-temperature dependence: at 4 degrees C SHMT has high synthetic activity but negligible retroaldol activity on L-threonine. Thus, the kinetic L-erythro isomer was largely favored and the reactions were virtually irreversible, highly stereoselective, and in turn, gave excellent conversion. It was also found that treatment of the prepared N-Cbz-gamma-amino-beta-hydroxy-alpha-amino acid derivatives with potassium hydroxide (1 m) resulted in the spontaneous formation of 2-oxazolidinone derivatives of the beta-hydroxyl and gamma-amino groups in quantitative yield. This reaction might be useful for further chemical manipulations of the products.
TI  - Effect of a lactose-free milk formula supplemented with bifidobacteria and streptococci on the recovery from acute diarrhoea.
AB  - Probiotics have been proposed for the management and prevention of acute diarrhoea in infants. A double-blind, randomised, placebo controlled study was carried out in 224 Chinese infants 6 to 36 months of age with severe acute diarrhoea and free from moderate or severe malnutrition. After oral or parenteral rehydration, they were allocated to one of three groups: a lactose-free formula (Control); the same formula but with viable 10(8)CFU B. lactis Bb12 and 5x10(7)CFU St. thermophilus TH4 per gram of powder and, the same formula with the same microorganisms, but with 10(9)CFU/g and 5x10(8)CFU, respectively. Anthropometric parameters, duration of the diarrhoea and rotavirus shedding were evaluated. Eighty seven percent of the episodes were associated with rotavirus infection. The duration of the diarrhoea was not influenced by the intake of probiotics. However, a decrease of rotavirus shedding was observed in infants fed the formula with 10(9) Bb12/g, a finding of probable epidemiological importance in the transmission of this agent.
TI  - Whey fermentation by thermophilic lactic acid bacteria: evolution of carbohydrates and protein content.
AB  - Whey, a by-product of the cheese industry usually disposed as waste, is a source  of biological and functional valuable proteins. The aim of this work was to evaluate the potentiality of three lactic acid bacteria strains to design a starter culture for developing functional whey-based drinks. Fermentations were performed at 37 and 42 degrees C for 24h in reconstituted whey powder (RW). Carbohydrates, organic acids and amino acids concentrations during fermentation were evaluated by RP-HPLC. Proteolytic activity was measured by the o-phthaldialdehyde test and hydrolysis of whey proteins was analyzed by Tricine SDS-PAGE. The studied strains grew well (2-3log cfu/ml) independently of the temperature used. Streptococcus thermophilus CRL 804 consumed 12% of the initial lactose concentration and produced the highest amount of lactic acid (45 mmol/l) at 24h. Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CRL 454 was the most proteolytic (91 microg Leu/ml) strain and released the branched chain amino acids Leu and Val. In contrast, Lactobacillus acidophilus CRL 636 and S. thermophilus CRL 804 consumed most of the amino acids present in whey. The studied strains were able to degrade the major whey proteins, alpha-lactalbumin being degraded in a greater extent (2.2-3.4-fold) than beta-lactoglobulin. Two starter cultures were evaluated for their metabolic and proteolytic activities in RW. Both cultures acidified and reduced the lactose content in whey in a greater extent than the strains alone. The amino acid release was higher (86 microg/ml) for the starter SLb (strains CRL 804+CRL 454) than for SLa (strains CRL 804+CRL 636, 37 microg/ml). Regarding alpha-lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin degradation, no differences were observed as compared to the values obtained with the single cultures. The starter culture SLb showed high potential to be used for developing fermented whey-based beverages.
TI  - Increase of skin-ceramide levels in aged subjects following a short-term topical  application of bacterial sphingomyelinase from Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Several studies have demonstrated that ceramides play an essential role in both the barrier and water-holding functions of healthy stratum corneum, suggesting that the dysfunction of the stratum corneum associated with ageing as well that observed in patients with several skin diseases could result from a ceramide deficiency. In a previous study our group reported a significant increase in skin ceramide levels in healthy subjects after treatment in vivo with a cream containing a preparation of Streptococcus thermophilus. The presence of high levels of neutral sphingomyelinase activity in this organism was responsible for the observed increase of stratum corneum ceramide levels, thus leading to an improvement in barrier function and maintenance of stratum corneum flexibility. The aim of the present work is to investigate the effects of the topical treatment of a Streptococcus thermophilus-containing cream on ceramide levels of stratum corneum of healthy elderly women. The ceramide levels, transepidermal water loss and capacitance were evaluated on stratum corneum sheets from the forearms of 20 healthy female subjects treated with a base cream or the same cream containing a sonicated preparation of the lactic acid bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus. A 2-week topical application of a sonicated Streptococcus thermophilus preparation led to significant and relevant increase of stratum corneum ceramide levels. Moreover, the hydration values of the treated forearm of each subject was significantly higher than control sites. These results suggest that the experimental cream was able to improve the lipid barrier and to increase a resistance against ageing-associated xerosis.
TI  - Probiotic Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris and Streptococcus thermophilus  induce IL-12 and IFN-gamma production.
AB  - AIM: To investigate the capacity of potentially probiotic strains from six bacterial genera to induce cytokine production alone or in combinations in order to identify potential enhancing or synergistic effects in order to select probiotic bacteria for in vivo purposes. METHODS: Cytokine production in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in response to stimulation with eleven different potentially probiotic bacterial strains from Streptococcus, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Lactococcus, Leuconostoc and Propionibacterium genera was analysed. Production and mRNA expression of TNF-alpha, IL-12, IFN-gamma and IL-10 were determined by ELISA and Northern blotting, respectively. RESULTS: All tested bacteria induced TNF-alpha production. The best inducers of Th1 type cytokines IL-12 and IFN-gamma were Streptococcus and Leuconostoc strains. All Bifidobacterium and Propionibacterium strains induced higher IL-10 production than other studied bacteria. Stimulation of PBMC with any bacterial combinations did not result in enhanced cytokine production suggesting that different bacteria whether gram-positive or gram-negative compete with each other during host cell interactions. CONCLUSION: The probiotic S. thermophilus and Leuconostoc strains are more potent inducers of Th1 type cytokines IL-12 and IFN-gamma than the probiotic Lactobacillus strains. Bacterial combinations did not result in enhanced cytokine production.
TI  - Proteolytic profiles and angiotensin-I converting enzyme and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activities of selected lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - This study was conducted to examine the growth, proteolytic profiles as well as angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) and alpha-glucosidase (alpha-glu) inhibitory potentials of selected strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB). Two strains each of yogurt bacteria (Streptococcus thermophilus-1275 and 285, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus-1092 and 1368), and probiotics (L. acidophilus-4461 and 33200, and L. casei-2607 and 15286, and 1 strain of Bifidobacterium longum 5022), were cultivated in reconstituted skim milk (RSM) at 37 degrees C and their proteolytic profiles and ACE as well as alpha-glu inhibitory activities were determined. Among all the strains of lactic acid bacteria studied, yogurt bacteria grew very well, with the exception of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 1368 which showed a slower growth during the initial 3 h of incubation. The growth pattern corresponded well with the decrease in pH for the organisms. All the organisms showed an increase in proteolysis with time. The variations in proteolytic capabilities translated into corresponding variations in ACE inhibitory potential of these organisms. Bifidobacterium longum 5022 showed the highest ACE inhibitory potential followed by L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 1368, L. casei 15286, S. thermophilus 1275, and L. acidophilus 4461. Organisms with high intracellular enzymatic activities grew well. Also, aminopeptidases of strains of L. acidophilus 4461 and S. thermophilus 1275 that could better utilize proline containing substrates showed enhanced ACE inhibitory potential. Lactic acid bacteria possessed the ability to inhibit alpha-glu activity, which endowed them an antidiabetic property as well.
TI  - Sensitivity of capsular-producing Streptococcus thermophilus strains to bacteriophage adsorption.
AB  - AIMS: To determine whether the presence and type of exopolysaccharides (EPS), slime-EPS or capsular, and the structural characteristics of the polymers produced by Streptococcus thermophilus strains could interfere with or be involved in phage adsorption. METHODS AND RESULTS: Phage-host interactions between eight EPS-producing Strep. thermophilus strains (CRL419, 638, 804, 810, 815, 817, 821, 1190) and five streptococcus specific phages (phiYsca, phi3, phi5, phi6, phi8) isolated from Argentinean faulty fermentation failed yoghurts were evaluated. No relationship was found between the EPS chemical composition and the phage sensitivity/resistance phenotype. In general, the capsular-producing strains were more sensitive to phage attacks than the noncapsular-producing strains. Streptococcus thermophilus CRL1190 (capsular-producing) was the only strain sensitive to all bacteriophages and showed the highest efficiency of plating. Phage adsorption to a capsular-negative, EPS low-producing mutant of strain CRL1190 was reduced, especially for phiYcsa and phi8. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of capsular polysaccharide surrounding the cells of Strep. thermophilus strains could play a role in the adsorption of specific phages to the cells. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Capsular-producing Strep. thermophilus strains should be evaluated for their bacteriophage sensitivity if they are included in starter cultures for the fermented food industry.
TI  - Effect of using propionic acid bacteria as an adjunct culture in yogurt production.
AB  - Propionibacteria are able to produce a wide variety of food components beneficial to human health. In this study, yogurt was produced by using the adjunct starter cultures Propionibacterium jensenii B1264 and Propionibacterium thoenii (jensenii) P126. Although the total solids and protein contents of the yogurts did not show any significant differences, titratable acidity of the control sample (YC-380) remained lower than that of Propionibacterium spp.-supplemented yogurts during 15 d of storage. The yogurts produced by YC-380 + P126 cultures had the firmest structure (0.26 N). The highest acetaldehyde (29.35 mg/kg) content was obtained with yogurt made with YC-380 + P126 + B1264 on d 1. The addition of propionibacteria to yogurt did not have any negative effect on the counts of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus in yogurt. During the first week of storage, propionibacteria counts remained high, suggesting that yogurt provided a good environment for these organisms. This new product would provide not only beneficial health effects, but also a new alternative product to plain set-type yogurt.
TI  - Whey starter for Grana Padano cheese: effect of technological parameters on viability and composition of the microbial community.
AB  - This work aimed to investigate the effects of thermal treatments and yeast extract addition on the composition of the microbial community of natural whey starters for Grana Padano cheese. Different natural whey starter samples were held at 4 degrees C for 24 h (cooling treatment), or at -20 degrees C for 24 h (freezing treatment) to evaluate the possibility of conservation, or at 54 degrees C for 1 h (heat treatment) to evaluate the effect of the temperature commonly used during curd cooking. Separately, another set of samples was enriched with 0.3, 0.5, and 1.0% (wt/vol) of yeast extract to study its effect on the growth of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in the starter. The new approach in this study is the use of 2 culture-independent methods: length heterogeneity (LH)-reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and fluorescence microscopy. These techniques allowed us to easily, quickly, and reproducibly assess metabolically active LAB in the control and treated samples. The LH-RT-PCR technique distinguished microorganisms based on natural variations in the length of 16S rRNA amplified by RT-PCR, as analyzed by using an automatic gene sequencer. Fluorescence microscopy counts were performed by using a Live/Dead BacLight bacterial viability kit. The repeatability of LH-RT-PCR showed that this technique has great potential to reveal changes in the microbial community of natural whey starters for Grana Padano cheese. All species showed low sensitivity to cold (4 degrees C). However, after the freezing (-20 degrees C) and heating (54 degrees C) treatments, different behaviors of the species were reported, with significant changes in their viability and relative composition. Heating treatment during curd cooking profoundly affected the viability and composition of the community that remained in the cheese and that consequently modified the microbial population. At the same time, this treatment produced the selection of LAB in whey and could be considered as the first step in natural whey starter production. Addition of yeast extract stimulated the growth of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. lactis to the detriment of Lactobacillus helveticus species. Because the yeast extract altered the microflora balance, whey starter conservation at -20 degrees C and yeast extract addition cannot be suggested as technological innovations.
TI  - Effect of wild strains used as starter cultures and adjunct cultures on the volatile compounds of the Pecorino Siciliano cheese.
AB  - The effect of six wild strains on the volatile profile of the PS cheese was investigated and compared to that generated from industrial starters generally used to produce PS cheese. All cheeses were subjected to microbiological, physicochemical, and volatile compounds analyses. The DGGE of the 16S rDNA analysis was also applied. The volatile compounds generated during ripening were studied through the SPME and the GC-MS methods. No difference was detected between the experimental and control cheeses throughout chemical and microbiological analyses, while the DGGE results showed the presence of Streptococcus thermophilus in all cheeses, and the dominance of Enterococcus durans, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Lactobacillus casei in most of the experimental cheeses. Moreover, the presence of Lactococcus lactis species as in the control and in the experimental P2 and P4 cheeses was also revealed. The SPME results showed more pronounced volatile compounds in the experimental cheese samples than in the control ones.
TI  - [Gene regulation to lactic acid bacteria for increasing production of flavor metabolite].
AB  - Abstract: The major flavor substances Lactic acid bacteria produced include the buttermilk aroma butanedione, the yoghurt flavor acetaldehyde and the amino acid. Metabolic engineering in LAB had focused primarily on rerouting of pyruvate metabolism towards butanedione or acetaldehyde to improve the flavor of fermented milk, which has considerable economic value. The typical yogurt flavor is caused by acetaldehyde produced through many different pathways. The attention was focused on one specific reaction for acetaldehyde formation catalyzed by serine hydroxymethyltransferase, which encoded by the glyA gene. In addition, the efficient conversion of glucose into acetaldehyde was achieved by over-expression of pyruvate decarboxylase and NADH oxidase in LAB. The concentration of acetaldehyde derived from this regulation is higher than the other strategy. As for the regulation of butanedione, it was focused on combinating inactivation of alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase with low lactate dehydrogenase activity, or with overproduction of NADH-oxidase, or with overproduction of alpha-acetolactate synthase. Then the possibility of co-regulation with certain three kinds of enzyme above was recommended.
TI  - Plasmid transfer via transduction from Streptococcus thermophilus to Lactococcus  lactis.
AB  - Using Streptococcus thermophilus phages, plasmid transduction in Lactococcus lactis was demonstrated. The transduction frequencies were 4 orders of magnitude lower in L. lactis than in S. thermophilus. These results are the first evidence that there is phage-mediated direct transfer of DNA from S. thermophilus to L. lactis. The implications of these results for phage evolution are discussed.
TI  - Influence of microorganisms on retinol isomerization in milk.
AB  - In order to have a deeper insight into the retinol isomerization phenomenon, in this work different milk samples have been analysed for their content of trans retinol and its cis-isomers, by means of reliable HPLC techniques. Levels of the different isomers and the degree of retinol isomerization (13-cis/all-trans ratio, %) have been monitored during milk storage at different temperatures and after addition of specific microorganisms. In raw milk stored at 4 degrees C for 96 h the degree of retinol isomerization shifted from 1.1 to 2.3%, while in raw milk stored at 22 degrees C for 24 h it increased from 1.1 to 12.7%. Among microorganisms tested in pasteurized milk, the most active in causing an increment in the 13-cis/all-trans ratio (%), from 3.4 to 33.4% in 8 h, was Streptococcus thermophilus. The results obtained demonstrated a relationship between microbial evolution and retinol isomerization. Therefore, the determination of retinol isomers is of importance not only for a more precise evaluation of vitamin A activity but also for the evaluation of the microbiological quality of milk.
TI  - Yogurt containing probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and L. reuteri RC-14 helps resolve moderate diarrhea and increases CD4 count in HIV/AIDS patients.
AB  - HIV/AIDS is changing the human landscape in sub-Saharan Africa. Relatively few patients receive antiretroviral therapy, and many suffer from debilitating diarrhea that affects their quality of life. Given the track record of probiotics to alleviate diarrhea, conventional yogurt fermented with Lactobacillus delbruekii var bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus was supplemented with probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and L. reuteri RC-14. Twenty-four HIV/AIDS adult female patients (18 to 44 y) with clinical signs of moderate diarrhea, CD4 counts over 200, and not receiving antiretrovirals or dietary supplements, consumed either 100 mL supplemented or unsupplemented yogurt per day for 15 days. Hematologic profiles, CD4 cell counts, and quality of life was evaluated at baseline, 15 and 30 days postprobiotic-yogurt feeding. There was no significant alteration in the hematologic parameters of both groups before and after the probiotic-yogurt feeding. The probiotic yogurt group at baseline, 15 and 30 days had a mean WBC count of 5.8+/-0.76 x 10(9)/L, 6.0+/-1.02 x 10(9)/L, and 5.4+/-0.14 x 10(9)/L, respectively. However, the mean CD4 cell count remained the same or increased at 15 and 30 days in 11/12 probiotic-treated subjects compared to 3/12 in the control. Diarrhea, flatulence, and nausea resolved in 12/12 probiotic-treated subjects within 2 days, compared to 2/12 receiving yogurt for 15 days. This is the first study to show the benefits of probiotic yogurt on quality of life of women in Nigeria with HIV/AIDS, and suggests that perhaps a simple fermented food can provide some relief in the management of the AIDS epidemic in Africa.
TI  - Probiotic Crescenza cheese containing Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus manufactured with high-pressure homogenized milk.
AB  - High-pressure homogenization (HPH) is one of the most promising alternatives to traditional thermal treatment of food preservation and diversification. Its effectiveness on the deactivation of pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms in model systems and real food is well documented. To evaluate the potential of milk treated by HPH for the production of Crescenza cheese with commercial probiotic lactobacilli added, 4 types of cheeses were made: HPH (from HPH-treated milk), P (from pasteurized milk), HPH-P (HPH-treated milk plus probiotics), and P-P (pasteurized milk plus probiotics) cheeses. A strain of Streptococcus thermophilus was used as starter culture for cheese production. Compositional, microbiological, physicochemical, and organoleptic analyses were carried out at 1, 5, 8, and 12 d of refrigerated storage (4 degrees C). According to results obtained, no significant differences among the 4 cheese types were observed for gross composition (protein, fat, moisture) and pH. Differently, the HPH treatment of milk increased the cheese yield about 1% and positively affected the viability during the refrigerated storage of the probiotic bacteria. In fact, after 12 d of storage, the Lactobacillus paracasei A13 cell loads were 8 log cfu/ g, whereas Lactobacillus acidophilus H5 exhibited, in P-P cheese, a cell load decrease of about 1 log cfu/g with respect to the HPH-P cheese. The hyperbaric treatment had a significant positive effect on free fatty acids release and cheese proteolysis. Also, probiotic cultures affected proteolytic and lipolytic cheese patterns. No significant differences were found for the sensory descriptors salty and creamy among HPH and P cheeses as well as for acid, piquant, sweet, milky, salty, creamy, and overall acceptance among HPH, HPH-P, and P-P Crescenza cheeses.
TI  - Effect of Versagel on the growth and metabolic activities of selected lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - In this study, the influence of a protein-based fat replacer, Versagel added at 1% and 2% (w/v) to reconstituted skim milk (RSM), on the growth and metabolic activities of selected strains of yogurt starters (Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus) as well as probiotic organisms (Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium longum) was examined. Addition of Versagel resulted in significantly improved growth of S. thermophilus and B. longum but inhibited that of L. casei, L. acidophilus, and L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus. This is also reflected in the extent of reduction of pH in RSM with added Versagel by these organisms. Among the biochemical activities, proteolytic activity of all the organisms except B. longum was adversely affected by the presence of Versagel, although the angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and alpha-glucosidase (alpha-glu) inhibitory activities were improved. Versagel at 1% level influenced the growth, while ACE inhibitory and alpha-glu inhibitory activities of the organisms were better at 2% level.
TI  - Crystal structure of the YdjC-family protein TTHB029 from Thermus thermophilus HB8: structural relationship with peptidoglycan N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase.
AB  - The YdjC-family protein is widely distributed, from human to bacteria, but so far no three-dimensional structure and functional analysis of this family of proteins has been reported. We determined the three-dimensional structure of the YdjC homolog TTHB029 at a resolution of 2.9A. The overall structure of the monomer consists of (betaalpha)-barrel fold forming a homodimer. Asp21, His60, and His127 residues coordinate to Mg(2+) as a possible active site. TTHB029 shows structural similarity to the peptidoglycan N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase from Streptococcus pneumoniae (SpPgdA). The active site groove of SpPgdA includes the Zn(2+) coordinated to Asp276, His326, and His330. Despite the low sequence identity, metal-binding residues of Asp-His-His were conserved among the two enzymes. There were definitive differences, however, in that one of the histidines of the metal-binding site was substituted for the other histidine located on the other loop. Moreover, these important metal-binding residues and the residues of the presumed active site are fully conserved in YdjC-family protein.
TI  - Molecular analysis of yogurt containing Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus in human intestinal microbiota.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Yogurt has traditionally been considered a probiotic-carrier food with health-promoting effects. Despite the universal assumption of this assertion, several researchers have evaluated the real capability of the yogurt bacteria Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus to survive and proliferate in the human intestine and have found contradictory results. OBJECTIVE: This double-blind crossover study assessed the qualitative and quantitative effects of fresh and heat-treated yogurt on bacterial intestinal microbiota from healthy subjects. DESIGN: The subjects were divided into experimental (n=63) and control (n=16) groups. The experimental group consumed fresh and heat-treated yogurt for 15 d according to a crossover design with a washout period of 2 wk. Three different fecal samples per individual were recovered: at baseline, after fresh yogurt intake, and after heat-treated yogurt intake. Qualitative changes in microbiota were studied by denaturing gel gradient electrophoresis (DGGE) with universal and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) 16S-rRNA primers. Quantitative changes in LAB, Clostridium coccoides, Clostridium perfringens, and Bacteroides groups were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: A particular DGGE stable band pattern was observed in each sample. No significant qualitative differences were detected in any fecal sample. However, a significantly higher density of LAB and C. perfringens and a significant decrease in the density of Bacteroides was observed after consumption of both types of yogurt. Microbiota density was not significantly different between the fresh and heat-treated yogurt groups, except for LAB, which was significantly greater in the fresh yogurt group. CONCLUSION: The main change in human microbiota observed after yogurt consumption was an increase in the density of LAB and C. perfringens to the detriment of Bacteroides. Bacterial changes were not different after the consumption of fresh and heat-treated yogurt.
TI  - [Comparison of genotypic and biochemical characteristics of Streptococcus thermophilus strains isolated from sour milk products].
AB  - Overall, 72 strains of lactic acid thermophilic streptococci isolated from sour milk products manufactured in various regions of Russia and European countries were analyzed using classical microbiological and molecular biological methods. Physiological and biochemical properties and genetic diversity of these Streptococcus thermophilus strains were studied, and a comparative analysis of the nucleotide sequences of the 16S rRNA gene was conducted. It has been demonstrated that the homology of proximal parts of the 16S rRNA gene of all the strains studied towards one another and towards the reference strain ATCC19258 amounts to 100%. As for the sugar fermentation, some strains display the characteristics untypical of the S. thermophilus members. The data obtained suggest that it is preferable to use gene 16S rRNA sequencing data for identification of natural isolates of closely related lactic acid bacterial species; moreover, this method is recommended for a precise species identification of industrial bacterial strains used in the food industry.
TI  - The inhibitory spectrum of thermophilin 9 from Streptococcus thermophilus LMD-9 depends on the production of multiple peptides and the activity of BlpG(St), a thiol-disulfide oxidase.
AB  - The blp(St) cluster of Streptococcus thermophilus LMD-9 was recently shown to contain all the genetic information required for the production of bacteriocins active against other S. thermophilus strains. In this study, we further investigated the antimicrobial activity of S. thermophilus LMD-9 by testing the susceptibility of 31 bacterial species (87 strains). We showed that LMD-9 displays an inhibitory spectrum targeted toward related gram-positive bacteria, including pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes. Using deletion mutants, we investigated the contribution of the three putative bacteriocin-encoding operons blpD(St)-orf2, blpU(St)-orf3, and blpE(St)-blpF(St) (bac(St) operons) and of the blpG(St) gene, which encodes a putative modification protein, to the inhibitory spectrum and immunity of strain LMD-9. Our results present evidence that the blp(St) locus encodes a multipeptide bacteriocin system called thermophilin 9. Among the four class II bacteriocin-like peptides encoded within the bac(St) operons, BlpD(St) alone was sufficient to inhibit the growth of most thermophilin 9-sensitive species. The blpD(St) gene forms an operon with its associated immunity gene(s), and this functional bacteriocin/immunity module could easily be transferred to Lactococcus lactis. The remaining three Bac(St) peptides, BlpU(St), BlpE(St), and BlpF(St), confer poor antimicrobial activity but act as enhancers of the antagonistic activity of thermophilin 9 by an unknown mechanism. The blpG(St) gene was also shown to be specifically required for the antilisteria activity of thermophilin 9, since its deletion abolished the sensitivities of most Listeria species. By complementation of the motility deficiency of Escherichia coli dsbA, we showed that blpG(St) encodes a functional thiol-disulfide oxidase, suggesting an important role for disulfide bridges within thermophilin 9.
TI  - Synbiotic synthesis of oligosaccharides during milk fermentation by addition of leuconostoc starter and sugars.
AB  - Synthesis of oligosaccharides during milk fermentation was attempted by inoculating Leuconostoc citreum with Lactobacillus casei, Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and Streptococcus thermophilus as starters. Dextransucrase of Ln. citreum worked as a catalyst for the transglycosylation reaction of sugars; sucrose was added as the glucose donor, and lactose or maltose acted as the acceptor compound for the reaction. When 4% sucrose was added in milk, glucosyl-lactose was synthesized (about 1%, w/v) after 1-2 days of fermentation at 15 or 25 degrees C. Alternatively, when sucrose and maltose (2% each, w/v) were added, panose (about 1%, w/v) and other isomaltooligosaccharides were made in a day at 15-35 degrees C. Growth patterns of lactobacilli and streptococci starters were not affected by the coculture of leuconostoc starter, but the rate of acid synthesis was slightly slowed at every temperature. Addition of sugars in milk did not give any adverse effect on the lactate fermentation. Accordingly, the use of leuconostoc starter and addition of sugars in milk allowed the production of oligosaccharides-containing fermented milk, and application of this method will facilitate the extensive development of synbiotic lactate foods.
TI  - Bacterial biodiversity of traditional Zabady fermented milk.
AB  - The aim of this work was to identify the bacterial biodiversity of traditional Zabady fermented milk using PCR-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (PCR-TTGE) and PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). Most of the identified bacterial species in Zabady samples belonged to lactic acid bacteria (LAB), e.g., Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus garvieae, Lactococcus raffinolactis, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc citreum, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Lactobacillus johnsonii. Using the culture-dependent and independent methods, the streptococcal and lactococcal groups appeared to be the major bacterial species in Zabady fermented milk, whereas the lactobacilli were the minor ones. The main dominant species was St. thermophilus followed by Lc. garvieae. Other molecular tools, e.g., species-specific PCR assay and cloning and sequencing strategy were used to confirm the TTGE and DGGE results. Lc. garvieae, Lc. raffinolactis, Ln. citreum, and Lb. johnsonii were identified for the first time in this type of Egyptian fermented milk.
TI  - Overexpression, physicochemical characterization, and modeling of a hyperthermophilic pyrococcus furiosus type 2 IPP isomerase.
AB  - In the first step of this study, type 2 isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (IDI2)  from Pyrococcus furiosus (pf-IDI2), a hyperthermophilic microorganism, was cloned and overexpressed in E. coli. After purification, hyperthermophilic behavior of this protein was approached by means of enzymatic assays and thermal denaturation studies. Compared with the mesophilic Streptococcus pneumoniae IDI2, which unfolds and looses activity above 50 degrees C, pf-IDI2 is still folded and active at 80 degrees C. Molecular modeling was applied, in a parallel step, to understand the molecular basis of thermal stability. Comparison of IDI2 from S. pneumoniae, T. thermophilus, and P. furiosus suggested that additional charged residues present in the hyperthermophilic enzyme might contribute to its higher thermal stability. This could increase the number of salt bridges between monomers of IDI2 in P. furiosus enzyme and, hence, decrease flexibility of loops or N-terminal segment, thereby enhancing its thermal stability.
TI  - Role of galK and galM in galactose metabolism by Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus is unable to metabolize the galactose moiety of lactose. In this paper, we show that a transformant of S. thermophilus SMQ-301 expressing Streptococcus salivarius galK and galM was able to grow on galactose and expelled at least twofold less galactose into the medium during growth on lactose.
TI  - Phage response to CRISPR-encoded resistance in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and their associated genes are linked to a mechanism of acquired resistance against bacteriophages. Bacteria can integrate short stretches of phage-derived sequences (spacers) within CRISPR loci to become phage resistant. In this study, we further characterized the efficiency of CRISPR1 as a phage resistance mechanism in Streptococcus thermophilus. First, we show that CRISPR1 is distinct from previously known phage defense systems and is effective against the two main groups of S. thermophilus phages. Analyses of 30 bacteriophage-insensitive mutants of S. thermophilus indicate that the addition of one new spacer in CRISPR1 is the most frequent outcome of a phage challenge and that the iterative addition of spacers increases the overall phage resistance of the host. The added new spacers have a size of between 29 to 31 nucleotides, with 30 being by far the most frequent. Comparative analysis of 39 newly acquired spacers with the complete genomic sequences of the wild-type phages 2972, 858, and DT1 demonstrated that the newly added spacer must be identical to a region (named proto-spacer) in the phage genome to confer a phage resistance phenotype. Moreover, we found a CRISPR1-specific sequence (NNAGAAW) located downstream of the proto-spacer region that is important for the phage resistance phenotype. Finally, we show through the analyses of 20 mutant phages that virulent phages are rapidly evolving through single nucleotide mutations as well as deletions, in response to CRISPR1.
TI  - Diversity, activity, and evolution of CRISPR loci in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) are hypervariable loci widely distributed in prokaryotes that provide acquired immunity against foreign genetic elements. Here, we characterize a novel Streptococcus thermophilus locus, CRISPR3, and experimentally demonstrate its ability to integrate novel spacers in response to bacteriophage. Also, we analyze CRISPR diversity and activity across three distinct CRISPR loci in several S. thermophilus strains. We show that both CRISPR repeats and cas genes are locus specific and functionally coupled. A total of 124 strains were studied, and 109 unique spacer arrangements were observed across the three CRISPR loci. Overall, 3,626 spacers were analyzed, including 2,829 for CRISPR1 (782 unique), 173 for CRISPR2 (16 unique), and 624 for CRISPR3 (154 unique). Sequence analysis of the spacers revealed homology and identity to phage sequences (77%), plasmid sequences (16%), and S. thermophilus chromosomal sequences (7%). Polymorphisms were observed for the CRISPR repeats, CRISPR spacers, cas genes, CRISPR motif, locus architecture, and specific sequence content. Interestingly, CRISPR loci evolved both via polarized addition of novel spacers after exposure to foreign genetic elements and via internal deletion of spacers. We hypothesize that the level of diversity is correlated with relative CRISPR activity and propose that the activity is highest for CRISPR1, followed by CRISPR3, while CRISPR2 may be degenerate. Globally, the dynamic nature of CRISPR loci might prove valuable for typing and comparative analyses of strains and microbial populations. Also, CRISPRs provide critical insights into the relationships between prokaryotes and their environments, notably the coevolution of host and viral genomes.
TI  - Identification and antimicrobial susceptibility of lactic acid bacteria from retail fermented foods.
AB  - One important safety criterion of using lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in food applications is to ensure that they do not carry transferable antimicrobial resistance (AR) determinants. In this study, 63 LAB belonging to six genera, Streptococcus, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Enterococcus, Leuconostoc, and Pediococcus, were recovered from 28 retail fermented food products in Maryland, identified to species with 16S-23S rRNA spacer PCRs, and characterized for antimicrobial susceptibility against eight antimicrobials. Besides intrinsic resistance to ciprofloxacin or vancomycin in some lactobacilli, tetracycline resistance was observed in two Streptococcus thermophilus isolates from one cheese and one sour cream sample and was associated with the presence of a nonconjugative tet(S) gene. The results indicated a low level of AR among naturally occurring and starter LAB cultures in fermented dairy and meat products in the United States; therefore, the probability for foodborne LAB to serve as reservoirs of AR is low. Further studies involving a larger sample size are needed to assess the potential risk of AR gene transfer from LAB in fermented food products.
TI  - Cloning of milk-derived bioactive peptides in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The enzymatic breakdown of milk proteins releases bioactive peptides. Two such peptides are the 11-residue antimicrobial peptide from bovine lactoferrin (BL-11) and the 12-residue hypotensive peptide from alpha(s1)-casein (C-12). These two peptides have now been cloned in Streptococcus thermophilus to develop strains that enhance the functionality and nutritional value of dairy food products. Nucleic acid sequences encoding the peptides were generated by overlapping PCR and were subsequently cloned into a new expression vector under control of the ST(2201) promoter. S. thermophilus transformants were successfully identified using GFP as a selectable marker. The presence of the synthetic gene constructs in S. thermophilus was confirmed by PCR.
TI  - Probiotic, as well as conventional yogurt, can enhance the stimulated production  of proinflammatory cytokines.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactic acid bacteria have been shown to stimulate the secretion of cytokines by lymphocytes and monocytes in a strain-dependent manner. Therefore, in this study, the effect of a daily intake of probiotic yogurt on cytokine production in young healthy women was compared with that of a conventional product. METHODS: For 2 weeks each, subjects consumed 100 g, then 200 g of either a probiotic or a conventional, commercially available yogurt, both containing Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus with additional Lactobacillus casei DN 114 001 in the probiotic product. Cytokine production in blood culture following stimulation with phytohaemmaglutinin and lipopolysaccharide was measured using Cytometric Bead Array and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Stimulated production of tumour necrosis factor-alpha increased significantly following consumption of conventional or probiotic yogurt (+63% and +24% compared with baseline, respectively, P < 0.001). There was also a significantly higher production of interleukin (IL)-1beta in the conventional (+40%, P = 0.006) and of interferon gamma in the probiotic group (+108%, P < 0.05). IL-10 decreased following consumption of the probiotic product, but increased significantly after intake cessation (+129%, P < 0.001). No significant differences in cytokine responses between the conventional and the probiotic yogurt were observed. CONCLUSION: Both conventional and probiotic yogurt enhanced the stimulated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
TI  - Effects of fructooligosaccharide and whey protein concentrate on the viability of starter culture in reduced-fat probiotic yogurt during storage.
AB  - Viability of yogurt starter cultures and Bifidobacterium animalis was assessed during 28 d storage in reduced-fat yogurts containing 1.5% milk fat supplemented with 1.5% fructooligosaccharide or whey protein concentrate. These properties were examined in comparison with control yogurts containing 1.5% and 3% milk fat and no supplement. Although fructooligosaccharide improved the viability of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subs. bulgaricus, and Bifidobacterium animalis, the highest growth was obtained when milk was supplemented with whey protein concentrate in reduced-fat yogurt (P < 0.05). Supplementation with 1.5% whey protein concentrate in reduced-fat yogurt increased the viable counts of S. thermophilus, L. delbrueckii subs. bulgaricus, and B. animalis by 1 log cycle in the 1st week of storage when compared to control sample. Similar improvement in the growth of both yogurt bacteria and B. animalis was also obtained in the full-fat yogurt containing 3% milk fat and no supplement. Addition of whey protein concentrate also resulted in the highest content of lactic and acetic acids (P < 0.05). A gradual increase was obtained in organic acid contents during the storage.
TI  - Urease production by Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - In order to identify potential alternative sources of urease for the removal of urea from alcoholic beverages, 205 strains of lactic acid bacteria belonging to 27 different species were screened for urease production. Only Streptococcus thermophilus produced urease. Cell permeabilization with toluene allowed to increase activity significantly. Optimal pH for urease activity in whole and permeabilized cells and of cell free extracts differed slightly, but was in the range 6.0-7.0. Significant activity was retained at pH 3.0 and 8.0, and, for cell free extracts, at pH 4.0 in the presence of ethanol. Urease production was evaluated in fermentations with pH control (5.25-6.5) and without pH control. Very little urease was produced in absence of urea, which at 5g/l slowed growth significantly in fermentations without pH control, but prevented a decrease in pH below 5.1 and resulted in higher final biomass. Optimal pH for growth was between 6.0 and 6.5 but specific urease activity was higher for fermentations at low pH at the beginning of the exponential phase. However, a higher total urease activity was obtained at pH 6.0 and 6.5 because of higher biomass. Potential technological applications of urease production by S. thermophilus are discussed.
TI  - Effect of a probiotic mixed culture on texture profile and sensory performance of Minas fresh cheese in comparison with the traditional products.
AB  - The effect of a mixed probiotic culture on instrumental texture, and on sensorial and related properties of Minas fresh cheese during refrigerated storage was investigated. Three cheese-making trials were prepared: T1, with the traditional type O starter culture (Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis + L. lactis subsp. cremoris), T2 with only lactic acid and T3, with lactic acid and the probiotic ABT culture (Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 + Bifidobacterium animalis Bb-12 + Streptococcus thermophilus). Instrumental texture profile analysis and related properties were monitored during storage for up to 21 days. Lb. acidophilus and B. animalis were present in high levels throughout storage of cheeses T3, above 6 log cfu.g(-1), threshold required for probiotic activity, and stimulation of the La-5 growth was observed. Cheeses with added probiotic ABT culture, as well as those made adding lactic acid only, showed to be less brittle and with more favorable sensorial features, due to higher pH values. Results indicated that the use of probiotic ABT culture complementary to lactic acid for the purpose of substituting the type O (Lc. lactis subsp. lactis + Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris) culture, traditionally employed for Minas cheese production, is advantageous.
TI  - A genome-wide survey of short coding sequences in streptococci.
AB  - Identification of short genes that encode peptides of fewer than 60 aa is challenging, both experimentally and in silico. As a consequence, the universe of these short coding sequences (CDSs) remains largely unknown, although some are acknowledged to play important roles in cell-cell communication, particularly in Gram-positive bacteria. This paper reports a thorough search for short CDSs across streptococcal genomes. Our bioinformatic approach relied on a combination of advanced intrinsic and extrinsic methods. In the first step, intrinsic sequence information (nucleotide composition and presence of RBSs) served to identify new short putative CDSs (spCDSs) and to eliminate the differences between annotation policies. In the second step, pseudogene fragments and false predictions were filtered out. The last step consisted of screening the remaining spCDSs for lines of extrinsic evidence involving sequence and gene-context comparisons. A total of 789 spCDSs across 20 complete genomes (19 Streptococcus and one Enterococcus) received the support of at least one line of extrinsic evidence, which corresponds to an average of 20 short CDSs per million base pairs. Most of these had no known function, and a significant fraction (31%) are not even annotated as hypothetical genes in GenBank records. As an illustration of the value of this list, we describe a new family of CDSs, encoding very short hydrophobic peptides (20-23 aa) situated just upstream of some of the positive transcriptional regulators of the Rgg family. The expression of seven other short CDSs from Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ1066 that encode peptides ranging in length from 41 to 56 aa was confirmed by real-time quantitative RT-PCR and revealed a variety of expression patterns. Finally, one peptide from this list, encoded by a gene that is not annotated in GenBank, was identified in a cell-envelope-enriched fraction of S. thermophilus CNRZ1066.
TI  - Heat- and formalin-inactivated probiotic bacteria induce comparable cytokine patterns in intestinal epithelial cell-leucocyte cocultures.
AB  - The mode of inactivation of probiotic bacteria may profoundly affect their immune-modulatory properties to the point of reversal of effects in in vitro human intestinal epithelial-like cell cultures (Caco-2). To further investigate the influence of inactivation treatment on cytokine production, three probiotic strains were evaluated-live, heat-inactivated, and formalin-inactivated strains-for their impact on interleukin (IL) 6, IL-8, and IL-10 production in Caco-2-leucocyte cocultures. The tested bacteria induced strain-specific production of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10. No suppressive effects on cytokine synthesis were observed. Live microorganisms seemed to be slightly more potent inducers of cytokine production than nonviable strains, but differences to inactivated bacteria were not statistically significant. Our results indicate that heat and formalin treatments of probiotic microorganisms are equivalent inactivation methods in terms of induction of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 production in Caco-2-peripheral blood mononuclear cell cocultures and do not invert immune-modulatory effects.
TI  - Characterisation of pSMA23, a 3.5 kbp plasmid of Lactobacillus casei, and application for heterologous expression in Lactobacillus.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence of plasmid pSMA23 isolated from Lactobacillus casei A23 was determined. Plasmid pSMA23 is a 3497bp circular molecule with a G+C content of 38.18%. Four putative open reading frames were identified. Based on homology, two orfs were identified as genes encoding replication initiation (Rep) and mobilisation (Mob) protein, respectively. Various regulatory regions like promoters, ribosome binding site (RBS), transcriptional terminators were deduced from the sequences of rep and mob. The origin of replication (dso) was predicted. Shuttle vectors pL142 and pL157 were constructed for Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus using rep gene and ori of pSMA23 for replication in Lactobacillus, the ori of the commercial vector pBluescript SkII+ for replication in E. coli, and the erythromycin and chloramphenicol resistance genes of pE194 and pC194, respectively, as selection markers. Transformants of E. coli and Lactobacillus were obtained on media containing erythromycin and chloramphenicol, respectively, suggesting expression of the ermC and cat194 genes in both organisms. The shsp gene of plasmid pSt04 of Streptococcus thermophilus encoding a small heat shock protein and the Lactobacillus plantarum cbh gene encoding conjugated bile salts hydrolase were cloned and successfully expressed in the heterologous host Lb. casei LK1 with the aid of pSMA23-derived vectors.
TI  - Characterization of proteins belonging to the CHAP-related superfamily within the Firmicutes.
AB  - Cell division is a dynamic process ending by separation of the daughter cells. This final step requires the cleavage of the murein septum synthetized during cell division. In Streptococcus thermophilus, cse plays an important role in cell separation. Cse protein contains, at its N-terminal end, a signal peptide and a putative LysM motif suggesting that it is secreted and able to bind to the cell wall. Furthermore, the C-terminus of Cse carries a putative cysteine, histidine-dependent amidohydrolases/peptidases (CHAP) domain conferring to the protein a potential catalytic activity. To gain insight into the role of Cse in the cell division process, in silico analysis of the Firmicutes proteins displaying CHAP-related domain was undertaken. This work allowed us to distinguish and characterize within the Firmicutes the 2 families of proteins (CHAP and NlpC/p60) belonging to the CHAP superfamily. These 2 families regroup mainly peptidoglycan hydrolases. Data from the literature indicate that NlpC/p60 and CHAP proteins cleave distinct peptidoglycan bonds. Among the enzymes characterized within the Firmicutes, NlpC/p60 proteins are gamma-D-glutamate-meso-diaminopimelate muropeptidase. Instead, CHAP enzymes involved in cell separation are N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase and CHAP lysins have endopeptidase activity.
TI  - Regulation of excision of integrative and potentially conjugative elements from Streptococcus thermophilus: role of the arp1 repressor.
AB  - The integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) excise by site-specific recombination between attL and attR flanking sites, self-transfer the resulting circular form and integrate into the genome of the recipient cell. Two putative ICEs, ICESt1 and ICESt3, are integrated in the same locus in 2 strains of Streptococcusthermophilus. ICESt1 is a composite element harbouring an internal recombination site, attL'. The recombination between attL' and attR leads to the excision of a shorter putative ICE, ICESt2. ICESt1/ICESt2 and ICESt3 carry related regulation modules sharing the open reading frame arp1 that encodes a protein related to the cI repressor of the phage lambda. The repressors belonging to this family autoproteolyse in the presence of damaged DNA. Treatments with mitomycin C induce an increase in the excision of ICESt1, ICESt2 and ICESt3. Furthermore, the arp1 deletion leads to a 1,000-fold increase in the excision of ICESt1 and ICESt2 and to a decrease in the excision induction by mitomycin C. Thus, all together, these results suggest that the autocleavage of the arp1 repressor is involved in derepression of the S. thermophilus putative ICE excision by mitomycin C.
TI  - Hydrolysis of whey proteins by Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus grown in a chemically defined medium.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the ability of themophilic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) to hydrolyse the whey proteins beta-lactoglobulin (BLG) and alpha-lactalbumin (ALA) in a chemically defined medium (CDM). METHODS AND RESULTS: The ability of three LAB strains to hydrolyse BLG and ALA was studied in a CDM supplemented with these proteins or whey protein concentrate (WPC). Protein hydrolysis was determined by Tricine/SDS-PAGE and RP-HPLC. Maximum BLG (21%) and ALA (26%) degradation by LAB was observed using WPC. Under starving conditions, BLG degradation was greater for Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus CRL 454 than for Lactobacillus acidophilus CRL 636 and Streptococcus thermophilus CRL 804. All three strains showed different peptide profiles and were not able to hydrolyse ALA under starvation. CONCLUSIONS: The assayed LAB strains were able to degrade BLG during growth in a CDM and under starving conditions. The different peptide profiles obtained indicate distinct protease specificities. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These strains could be used as adjunct cultures to increase BLG digestibility in whey-based or whey-containing foods. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the ability of a Lact. acidophilus strain to degrade BLG.
TI  - Redox potential to discriminate among species of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: To verify to what degree reducing capacity is a characterizing parameter of a species, and of the strains themselves within a given species, of lactic acid bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighty-eight strains belonging to 10 species of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from traditional Italian cheeses were studied for their reduction activity: Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus helveticus and Pediococcus pentosaceus. It was observed that the lactococci reached minimum redox potential before the lactobacilli. The reduction rate of Enterococcus spp. and L. lactis ssp. lactis was higher than that of the streptococci and Lactobacillus spp. All the P. pentosaceus strains had poor reduction activity compared with the other species. CONCLUSIONS: The evolution of the redox potential in milk over a time span of 24 h has been found to be a parameter that characterizes a species: the different courses corresponding to the species in question are clearly evident, and interesting differences can also be noted within the same species. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The reduction aptitude of strains might be used to select and adapt appropriate strains for use as starters for dairy products.
TI  - Impact of lactic acid bacteria on oxidative DNA damage in human derived colon cells.
AB  - It is assumed that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a key role in inflammatory  bowel diseases and colon cancer and a number of studies indicate that lactic acid bacteria (LAB) possess antioxidant properties and may prevent these diseases. In the present study, we developed a model which allowed us to investigate the prevention of oxidative DNA damage in human derived colon (HT29) cells by LAB. Furthermore, we investigated if these effects correlate with superoxide (O2(-)) resistance of the strains. The protective properties of 55 strains were monitored in single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assays. After preincubation of the cells with LAB (60 min), oxidative damage was induced by exposure to plumbagin (5.0 microM, 120 min) which releases O2(-) or by hydrogen peroxide (50 microM, 10 min); O2(-) resistance was monitored in plate growth inhibition assays. 25 strains (45%) reduced plumbagin induced DNA migration while only few of them (20%) were protective towards hydrogen peroxide induced damage. The strongest effects (up to 60% reduction of O2(-) induced DNA migration) were observed with representatives of the species Streptococcus thermophilus. The prevention of DNA damage in the colon cells by the bacteria did not correlate with their O2(-) resistance. Additional experiments indicate that the reduction of oxidative damage is only seen with viable bacteria but not with heat inactivated cells and that it takes also place when the colon cells are separated from the LAB by permeable filter membranes indicating that the bacteria release ROS protective factors into the medium. Dose response experiments showed that the protection depends on the concentration of the bacteria; significant effects were observed with titers 3 x 10(6-7)cells/ml. Unexpectedly, we found that a substantial fraction of the strains (13%) induced DNA damage in untreated cells, some of them increased also the effects of the ROS generating chemicals. Preliminary experiments with tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) agar indicate that this phenomenon may be due to release of hydrogen peroxide by the bacteria. Overall, our study shows that the impact of LAB on DNA damage in human derived colon cells is ambivalent; while the majority of strains was protective against oxidative damage some of them induced per se pronounced DNA migration. Since the effects were seen with bacterial concentrations which may be reached in the intestinal tract after consumption of fermented milk products, it is likely that the effects we observed in the present study are relevant for humans.
TI  - Molecular organization of plasmid pER13 in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Molecular features of the 4139-bp plasmid pER13 found in the dairy fermentation bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus ST113 include five open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1, ORF2 and ORF3 encode proteins for transcriptional repression (CopG), replication (RepB) and mobilization (Mob) that share homology with corresponding proteins of the pMV158 plasmid family, while ORF4 and ORF5 encode putative proteins with unspecified functions. Sequence homologies shared with plasmids found in group B and group D streptococci imply the possibility for genetic exchange with the food-grade S. thermophilus. The structural features of pER13 may be useful in designing strategies for gene transfer in lactic fermentation bacteria.
TI  - Effects of yogurt and bifidobacteria supplementation on the colonic microbiota in lactose-intolerant subjects.
AB  - AIMS: Colonic metabolism of lactose may play a role in lactose intolerance. We investigated whether a 2-week supplementation of Bifidobacterium longum (in capsules) and a yogurt enriched with Bifidobacterium animalis could modify the composition and metabolic activities of the colonic microbiota in 11 Chinese lactose-intolerant subjects. METHODS AND RESULTS: The numbers of total cells, total bacteria and the Eubacterium rectale/Clostridium coccoides group in faeces as measured with fluorescent in situ hybridization and the faecal beta-galactosidase activity increased significantly during supplementation. The number of Bifidobacterium showed a tendency to increase during and after supplementation. With PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, in subjects in which B. animalis and B. longum were not detected before supplementation, both strains were present in faeces during supplementation, but disappeared after supplementation. The degree of lactose digestion in the small intestine and the oro-caecal transit time were not different before and after supplementation, whereas symptom scores after lactose challenge decreased after supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that supplementation modifies the amount and metabolic activities of the colonic microbiota and alleviates symptoms in lactose-intolerant subjects. The changes in the colonic microbiota might be among the factors modified by the supplementation which lead to the alleviation of lactose intolerance. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study provides evidence for the possibility of managing lactose intolerance with dietary lactose (yogurt) and probiotics via modulating the colonic microbiota.
TI  - Control of the transcription of a short gene encoding a cyclic peptide in Streptococcus thermophilus: a new quorum-sensing system?
AB  - Gram-positive bacteria secrete a variety of peptides that are often subjected to  posttranslational modifications and that are either antimicrobials or pheromones involved in bacterial communication. Our objective was to identify peptides secreted by Streptococcus thermophilus, a nonpathogenic bacterium widely used in dairy technology in association with other bacteria, and to understand their potential roles in cell-cell communication. Using reverse-phase liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, and Edman sequencing, we analyzed the culture supernatants of three S. thermophilus strains (CNRZ1066, LMG18311, and LMD-9) grown in a medium containing no peptides. We identified several peptides in the culture supernatants, some of them found with the three strains while others were specific to the LMD-9 strain. We focused our study on a new modified peptide secreted by S. thermophilus LMD-9 and designated Pep1357C. This peptide contains 9 amino acids and lost 2 Da in a posttranslational modification, most probably a dehydrogenation, leading to a linkage between the Lys2 and Trp6 residues. Production of Pep1357C and transcription of its encoding gene depend on both the medium composition and the growth phase. Furthermore, we demonstrated that transcription of the gene coding for Pep1357C is drastically decreased in mutants inactivated for the synthesis of a short hydrophobic peptide, a transcriptional regulator, or the oligopeptide transport system. Taken together, our results led us to deduce that the transcription of the Pep1357C-encoding gene is controlled by a new quorum-sensing system.
TI  - Inhibition of bacteriophage replication in Streptococcus thermophilus by subunit  poisoning of primase.
AB  - Invariant and highly conserved amino acids within a primase consensus sequence were targeted by site-specific mutations within the putative primase of Streptococcus thermophilus phage kappa3. PCR products containing the desired mutation(s) within putative ATPase/helicase and/or oligomerization domains of the kappa3-encoded primase gene were cloned into a high-copy-number vector and expressed in S. thermophilus NCK1125. The majority of the plasmid constructs failed to alter phage sensitivity; however, four of the constructs conferred strong phage resistance upon the host. Expression of the K238(A/T) and RR340-341AA mutant proteins in trans suppressed the function of the native phage primase protein in a dominant negative fashion via a proposed subunit poisoning mechanism. These constructs completely inhibited phage genome synthesis and reduced the efficiencies of plaquing and centre of infection formation by more than 9 and 3.5 logs, respectively. Amber mutations introduced upstream of the transdominant RR340-341AA and K238(A/T) mutations restored phage genome replication and sensitivity of the host, indicating that translation was required to confer phage resistance. Introduction of an E437A mutation in a putative oligomerization domain located downstream of the transdominant K238T mutation also completely suppressed phage resistance. This study appears to represent the first use of transdominant proteins to inhibit phages that are disruptive to cultures used in industrial fermentations.
TI  - [Comparative analysis of genome sizes in Streptococcus thermophilus strains].
AB  - Twenty-five Streptococcus thermophilus isolates were analyzed using pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and gene restriction profile analysis techniques. 16S rRNA gene sequences of the isolates were almost 100% homologous. However, genomic fingerprinting analysis has shown variability in both genome size and restriction fragments length. The genomes varied from 1417 to 2075 kb resulting in the difference between marginal genome sizes in about 600 kb. The results are indicative of Streptococcus thermophilus intraspecies genetic polymorphism, the origin of which requires further investigation.
TI  - The effect of daily consumption of probiotic and conventional yoghurt on oxidant  and anti-oxidant parameters in plasma of young healthy women.
AB  - In recent years there has been increasing interest in the potential beneficial effects of probiotic bacteria, particularly concerning their immune-modulating effects. Considering the involvement of free radicals in immunological processes, we tried to verify and compare the effects of probiotic (Lactobacillus casei) and conventional yoghurt on antioxidant and oxidant parameters in plasma of humans. In this study female volunteers consumed 100 g/day of probiotic (n = 17) or conventional yoghurt (n = 16) for two weeks (T1-T2) and 200 g/day for another two weeks (T2-T3). A wash-out phase lasting two weeks followed. Total antioxidant capacity (TAC), albumin, and bilirubin were determined photometrically, uric acid was determined by enzymatic methods, and vitamin E, carotenoids, malondialdehyde (MDA), and conjugated dienes (CD) were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In the period of continuous yoghurt intake (T1-T3), mean concentrations of the antioxidants vitamin E, lycopene, and zeaxanthin decreased significantly (p < 0.01) in the probiotic and in the control group. The average concentrations of lutein, beta-carotene, albumin, uric acid, and bilirubin decreased significantly (p < 0.05) in the probiotic group, only. These alterations led to a significant (p < 0.001) decrease of the average TAC values during the period T1-T3 in both tested groups. In the interval of daily yoghurt consumption (T1-T3) the mean plasma levels of oxidant parameters MDA and CD increased significantly in the probiotic (MDA: p < 0.01; CD: p < 0.001) and the control group (CD: p < 0.01). The average activity of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) was quite constant throughout the study in both groups. The mean activities of GSH-Px and catalase decreased significantly (p < 0.001) in the probiotic group, only after consuming yoghurt daily for four weeks (T1-T3). Although several parameters changed significantly during the study, no significant differences were observed between both investigated groups. Therefore, the results indicate a possible influence of both probiotic and conventional yoghurt on the plasma levels of antioxidant and oxidant parameters.
TI  - Safety assessment of dairy microorganisms: the Lactobacillus genus.
AB  - Lactobacilli are Gram positive rods belonging to the Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) group. Their phenotypic traits, such as each species' obligate/facultative, homo/heterofermentation abilities play a crucial role in souring raw milk and in the production of fermented dairy products such as cheese, yoghurt and fermented milk (including probiotics). An up to date safety analysis of these lactobacilli is needed to ensure consumer safety. Lactobacillus genus is a heterogeneous microbial group containing some 135 species and 27 subspecies, whose classification is constantly being reshuffled. With the recent use of advanced molecular methods it has been suggested that the extreme diversity of the Lactobacillus genomes would justify recognition of new subgeneric divisions. A combination of genotypic and phenotypic tests, for example DNA-based techniques and conventional carbohydrate tests, is required to determine species. Pulsed-Field gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) has been successfully applied to strains of dairy origin and is the most discriminatory and reproducible method for differentiating Lactobacillus strains. The bibliographical data support the hypothesis that the ingestion of Lactobacillus is not at all hazardous since lactobacillemia induced by food, particularly fermented dairy products, is extremely rare and only occurs in predisposed patients. Some metabolic features such as the possible production of biogenic amines in fermented products could generate undesirable adverse effects. A minority of starter and adjunct cultures and probiotic Lactobacillus strains may exceptionally show transferable antibiotic resistance. However, this may be underestimated as transferability studies are not systematic. We consider that transferable antibiotic resistance is the only relevant cause for caution and justifies performing antibiotic-susceptibility assays as these strains have the potential to serve as hosts of antibiotic-resistance genes, with the risk of transferring these genes to other bacteria. However, as a general rule, lactobacilli have a high natural resistance to many antibiotics, especially vancomycin, that is not transferable. Safety assessment requirements for Lactobacillus strains of technological interest should be limited to an antibiotic profile and a study to determine whether any antibiotic resistance(s) of medical interest detected is (or are) transferable. This agrees with the recent EFSA proposal suggesting attribution of a QPS status for 32 selected species of lactobacilli.
TI  - Use of probiotics in HIV-infected children: a randomized double-blind controlled  study.
AB  - HIV/AIDS is an infection characterized by immune cell dysfunction and subsequent  immunodeficiency, as well as intestinal disorder. Probiotics are live microbial feed supplements that beneficially affect the host animal by improving intestinal microbial balance and promoting health benefits. The goals of this study were to determine whether the use of probiotics could improve the immune response determined by CD4 cells mm(-3) counts and reduce liquid stool episodes. A randomized double-blind controlled trial with 77 HIV-infected children (2-12 years), divided into two groups: one receiving probiotics (formula containing Bifidobacterium bifidum with Streptococcus thermophilus -2.5 x 10(10) colony forming units) and the other, a standard formula (control group), for 2 months. The CD4 counts (cells mm(-3)) were collected at the beginning and end of the study. The quality and number of stools were assessed by a questionnaire (watery to normal stool consistency). There was an increase in the mean CD4 count in the probiotics group (791 cells mm(-3)) and a small decrease in the control group (538 cells mm(-3)). The change from baseline in mean CD4 cell count was +118 cells mm(-3) vs. -42 cells mm(-3) for children receiving the probiotic formula and control formula, respectively (p = 0.049). A similar reduction in liquid stool consistency in both the groups (p < 0.06), with a slight enhancement in the probiotics group, was observed, but without significant difference (p < 0.522). The incidence of loose-soft stools showed a small decrease in both groups (p < 0.955) and there was an increase in the incidence of normal stool consistency in both the groups (p < 0.01). Our study showed that probiotics have immunostimulatory properties and might be helpful in the treatment of HIV-infected children.
TI  - A simple intact protein analysis by MALDI-MS for characterization of ribosomal proteins of two genome-sequenced lactic acid bacteria and verification of their amino acid sequences.
AB  - Rapid identification of bacteria by a bioinformatics-based approach, which processes the mass spectra observed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS), relies on the calculated masses of ribosomal subunit proteins as biomarkers predicted from amino acid sequences found in protein sequence databases. To verify the actual state of the registered sequence information, a simple intact protein analysis by MALDI-MS using cell lysates as samples was applied to the characterization of ribosomal proteins from genome-sequenced Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strains. This method avoided the risk of loss of some subunit proteins and the formation of disulfide bonds during the purification of ribosomal proteins. By comparing this with the MALDI mass spectra of different strains and carrying out manual inspection of sequence information, a total of five errors in N-terminal amino acid sequences were identified. After sequence correction, approximately 40 out of 53 subunit proteins could be assigned, considering N-terminal methionine loss only as a post-translational modification. These show promise for use as practical biomarkers for the rapid identification of S. thermophilus and L. bulgaricus. After verification of these amino acid sequences, mass differences relative to those of genome-sequenced strains have the potential for distinguishing bacteria at the strain level.
TI  - Safety assessment of dairy microorganisms: Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus is a major dairy starter used in yogurt and cheese production. In Streptococcus genus, S. thermophilus is the only one food species among commensal and opportunistic pathogen species. Comparative genomics suggest that this species recently emerged and evolved by combination of loss-of-function and horizontal gene transfer events. These gene transfer events detected in S. thermophilus have originated from other dairy species and might contribute to its adaptation to the milk environment.
TI  - The extent of co-metabolism of glucose and galactose by Lactococcus lactis changes with the expression of the lacSZ operon from Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The lactose transporter and beta-galactosidase from Streptococcus thermophilus, encoded by the lacSZ operon, were introduced into the lactose-negative strain Lactococcus lactis MG1363 and the expression of the lacSZ operon was modulated by substitution of the native promoter with randomized synthetic promoters. A series of strains with various expression levels of lacSZ were examined for their fermentation of lactose. Strains with a high expression level were found to metabolize lactose in a similar manner to S. thermophilus, i.e. the galactose moiety of lactose was excreted to the growth medium and only glucose was metabolized in glycolysis. Interestingly, strains with low expression of the operon showed a mixed acid metabolism and co-metabolism of galactose and glucose. The lactose flux increased gradually with increasing expression of the lacSZ operon until an optimum was observed at intermediate beta-galactosidase activities of 2000-3000 Miller units. At higher expression levels, the flux decreased. These strains had a glycolytic flux comparable with those of reference strains with the standard lactococcal PTS(lac) (lactose phosphotransferase transport system) lactose transporter, which indicates that lactose transport is not rate-limiting for glycolysis in Lactococcus. Finally, an additional ATP drain was introduced into the fastest growing strain, CS2004, to test whether the ATP demand controlled glycolysis under these conditions, but in fact no increase in glycolytic flux was observed.
TI  - Variability of bacterial biofilms of the "tina" wood vats used in the ragusano cheese-making process.
AB  - Ragusano cheese is a "protected denomination of origin" cheese made in the Hyblean region of Sicily from raw milk using traditional wooden tools, without starter. To explore the Ragusano bacterial ecosystem, molecular fingerprinting was conducted at different times during the ripening and biofilms from the wooden vats called "tinas" were investigated. Raw milks collected at two farm sites, one on the mountain and one at sea level, were processed to produce Ragusano cheese. Raw milk, curd before and after cooking, curd at stretching time (cheese 0 time), and cheese samples (4 and 7 months) were analyzed by PCR-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (PCR-TTGE) and by classical enumeration microbiology. With the use of universal primers, PCR-TTGE revealed many differences between the raw milk profiles, but also notable common bands identified as Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus lactis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, and Enterococcus faecium. After the stretching, TTGE profiles revealed three to five dominant species only through the entire process of ripening. In the biofilms of the two tinas used, one to five species were detected, S. thermophilus being predominant in both. Biofilms from five other tinas were also analyzed by PCR-TTGE, PCR-denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis, specific PCR tests, and sequencing, confirming the predominance of lactic acid bacteria (S. thermophilus, L. lactis, and L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis) and the presence of a few high-GC-content species, like coryneform bacteria. The spontaneous acidification of raw milks before and after contact with the five tinas was followed in two independent experiments. The lag period before acidification can be up to 5 h, depending on the raw milk and the specific tina, highlighting the complexity of this natural inoculation system.
TI  - Identification and characterization of starter lactic acid bacteria and probiotics from Columbian dairy products.
AB  - AIMS: Considering the significant rise in the probiotic market in Columbia, and given the lack of reports concerning the microbial population and strain performance in products from different producers, this study aims at determining the number of viable starter bacteria and probiotics in bio-yoghurts available at the Columbian market, identifying the species and analysing the performance of the isolated strains in bile acid resistance, antagonistic activity against pathogens, and adherence capacity to human intestinal epithelial cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: Seven bio-yoghurts were analysed for the bacterial species present. Species identification was carried out using 16S rRNA gene targeted PCR. The cultured bacteria were tested for bile acid resistance, adherence to a human intestinal epithelial cell line, and antagonism against the pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. A total of 17 different strains were identified. Based on plate counting, all bio-yoghurts have at least total viable cells of approximately 10(7) CFU ml(-1). Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus were the most frequently isolated bacteria. Viable Bifidobacterium was only recovered from one product. However, after PCR analysis, DNA of this genus was confirmed in five out of seven products. Major differences were found for S. typhimurium antagonism. The adherence capacity to Caco-2 cells was observed in 10 of the isolated strains. In general, low survival to simulated gastric juice was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Some of the isolated strains have probiotic potential, although not all of them were present in the advised amount to exert beneficial health effects. However, the full correct scientific name of the isolated bacteria and their viable counts were not included on the product label. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first report describing the identification and functionality of starter bacteria and probiotics present in dairy products on the Columbian market.
TI  - Genome sequence of Streptococcus mutans bacteriophage M102.
AB  - Bacteriophage M102 is a lytic phage specific for serotype c strains of Streptococcus mutans, a causative agent of dental caries. In this study, the complete genome sequence of M102 was determined. The genome is 31,147 bp in size and contains 41 ORFs. Most of the ORFs encoding putative phage structural proteins show similarity to those from bacteriophages from Streptococcus thermophilus. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that the M102 genome contains an unusual lysis cassette, which encodes a holin and two lytic enzymes.
TI  - A randomized, controlled trial of lactic acid bacteria for idiopathic hyperoxaluria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Urinary oxalate excretion is an important contributor to calcium oxalate stone formation. Methods of reducing oxalate excretion are not wholly satisfactory, and no controlled trials using them have been performed to prevent stone recurrence. Some lactic acid bacteria can degrade oxalate in vitro. This study sought to reduce urinary oxalate excretion in calcium stone formers with idiopathic hyperoxaluria. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND MEASUREMENTS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed of Oxadrop, a mix of four lactic acid bacterium species. This preparation previously reduced oxalate excretion in stone formers with idiopathic and enteric hyperoxaluria. Patients were selected from two stone prevention clinics. Twenty people with calcium stones and idiopathic hyperoxaluria (>40 mg/d) were enrolled and randomly assigned 1:1 in placebo and active preparation arms. Both groups took 3.6 g of granulate each day: Either placebo or the experimental preparation. Participants performed two consecutive 24-h urine collections at baseline, at 28 d of therapy, and at 56 d, after being off the preparation for 4 wk. Diet was replicated at each point. RESULTS: There was no effect of the study preparation: Mean 24-h urinary oxalate excretion in placebo-treated patients was 73.9 mg at baseline and 72.7 mg after treatment, whereas the Oxadrop-treated patients had 59.1 mg at baseline and 55.4 mg after treatment. The preparation was well tolerated; three participants on active treatment experienced mild constipation. CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized, placebo-controlled trial, Oxadrop did not reduce urinary oxalate excretion in participants with idiopathic hyperoxaluria.
TI  - Use of human lysozyme transgenic goat milk in cheese making: effects on lactic acid bacteria performance.
AB  - Genetically engineered goats expressing elevated levels of the antimicrobial enzyme lysozyme in their milk were developed to improve udder health, product shelf life, and consumer well-being. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of lysozyme on the development of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) throughout the cheese-making process. Raw and pasteurized milk from 7 lysozyme transgenic goats and 7 breed-, age-, and parity-matched nontransgenic controls was transformed into cheeses by using industry methods, and their microbiological load was evaluated. The numbers of colony-forming units of LAB were determined for raw and pasteurized goat milk, whey, and curd at d 2 and at d 6 or 7 of production. Selective plating media were used to enumerate lactococcal species separately from total LAB. Although differences in the mean number of colony-forming units between transgenic and control samples in raw milk, whey, and cheese curd were non-significant for both total LAB and lactococcal species from d 2 of production, a significant decrease was observed in both types of LAB among d 6 transgenic raw milk cheese samples. In pasteurized milk trials, a significant decrease in LAB was observed only in the raw milk of transgenic animals. These results indicate that lysozyme transgenic goat milk is not detrimental to LAB growth during the cheese-making process.
TI  - Galactose metabolism and capsule formation in a recombinant strain of Streptococcus thermophilus with a galactose-fermenting phenotype.
AB  - The capsule-producing, galactose-negative Streptococcus thermophilus MR-1C strain was first transformed with a low-copy plasmid containing a functional galK gene from Streptococcus salivarius to generate a recombinant galactose-fermenting Strep. thermophilus strain named MR-AAC. Then, we compared the functional properties of Strep. thermophilus MR-AAC with those of the parent MR-1C strain when used as starter for fermented products and cheese. In lactose-supplemented laboratory medium, MR-AAC metabolized galactose, but only when the amount of lactose was less than 0.1% (wt/vol). After 7 h of fermentation, the medium was almost depleted of galactose. The parent strain, MR-1C, showed the same pattern, except that the concentration of galactose decreased by only 25% during the same period. It was found that, during milk fermentation and Mozzarella cheese production, the galactose-fermenting phenotype was not expressed by MR-AAC and this strain expelled galactose into the medium at a level similar to the parent MR-1C strain. In milk and in lactose-supplemented medium, capsular exopolysaccharide production occurred mainly during the late exponential phase and the stationary growth phase with similar kinetics between MR-1C and MR-AAC.
TI  - Quorum-sensing regulation of the production of Blp bacteriocins in Streptococcus  thermophilus.
AB  - The blp gene cluster identified in the genome sequences of Streptococcus thermophilus (blp(St)) LMG18311, CNRZ1066, and LMD-9 displays all the characteristics of a class II bacteriocin locus. In the present study, we showed that the blp(St) locus is only fully functional in strain LMD-9 and regulates the production of antimicrobial peptides that inhibit strains LMG18311 and CNRZ1066. The blp(St) cluster of LMD-9 contains 23 genes that are transcriptionally organized in six operons: blpABC(St) (peptide transporter genes and pheromone gene); blpRH(St) (two-component regulatory system genes); blpD(St)-orf1, blpU(St)-orf3, and blpE-F(St) (bacteriocin precursors and immunity genes); and blpG-X(St) (unknown function). All the operons, except the regulatory unit blpRH(St), were shown to be coregulated at the transcriptional level by a quorum-sensing mechanism involving the mature S. thermophilus pheromone BlpC* (BlpC*(St)), which was extracellularly detected as two active forms (30 and 19 amino acids). These operons are differentially transcribed depending on growth phase and pheromone concentration. They all contain a motif with two imperfect direct repeats in their mapped promoter regions that could serve as binding sites of the response regulator BlpR(St). Through the construction of deletion mutants, the blp(St) locus of strain LMD-9 was shown to encode all the essential functions associated with bacteriocin production, quorum-sensing regulation, and immunity.
TI  - Probiotics.
AB  
TI  - Probiotics for treatment of acute diarrhoea in children: randomised clinical trial of five different preparations.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of five probiotic preparations recommended to  parents in the treatment of acute diarrhoea in children. Design Randomised controlled clinical trial in collaboration with family paediatricians over 12 months. SETTING: Primary care. PARTICIPANTS: Children aged 3-36 months visiting a family paediatrician for acute diarrhoea. INTERVENTION: Children's parents were randomly assigned to receive written instructions to purchase a specific probiotic product: oral rehydration solution (control group); Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG; Saccharomyces boulardii; Bacillus clausii; mix of L delbrueckii var bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, L acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium bifidum; or Enterococcus faecium SF68. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were duration of diarrhoea and daily number and consistency of stools. Secondary outcomes were duration of vomiting and fever and rate of admission to hospital. Safety and tolerance were also recorded. RESULTS: 571 children were allocated to intervention. Median duration of diarrhoea was significantly shorter (P<0.001) in children who received L rhamnosus strain GG (78.5 hours) and the mix of four bacterial strains (70.0 hours) than in children who received oral rehydration solution alone (115.0 hours). One day after the first probiotic administration, the daily number of stools was significantly lower (P<0.001) in children who received L rhamnosus strain GG and in those who received the probiotic mix than in the other groups. The remaining preparations did not affect primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes were similar in all groups. CONCLUSIONS: Not all commercially available probiotic preparations are effective in children with acute diarrhoea. Paediatricians should choose bacterial preparations based on effectiveness data.

TI  - Control of methionine synthesis and uptake by MetR and homocysteine in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - MetR (formerly Smu.1225), a regulator of the LysR family, controls key genes for  methionine supply in Streptococcus mutans. An S. mutans metR mutant is unable to transport l-methionine and to grow in the absence of this amino acid. Accordingly, MetR activates transcription by binding to the promoter regions of two gene clusters and smu.1487, whose products are involved in methionine biosynthesis (MetEF and Smu.1487) and uptake (AtmBDE). Transcriptional activation by MetR requires the presence of a 17-bp palindromic sequence, the Met box. Base substitutions in the Met box hinder the formation of a MetR-DNA complex and abolish MetR-dependent activation, showing that Met boxes correspond to MetR recognition sites. Activation by MetR occurs in methionine-depleted medium and is rapidly triggered under nonactivating conditions by the addition of homocysteine. This intermediate of methionine biosynthesis increases the affinity of MetR for DNA in vitro and appears to be the MetR coeffector in vivo. Homocysteine plays a crucial role in methionine metabolic gene regulation by controlling MetR activity. A similar mechanism of homocysteine- and MetR-dependent control of methionine biosynthetic genes operates in S. thermophilus. These data suggest a common mechanism for the regulation of the methionine supply in streptococci. However, some streptococcal species are unable to synthesize the homocysteine coeffector. This intriguing feature is discussed in the light of comparative genomics and streptococcal ecology.
TI  - Aspartate biosynthesis is essential for the growth of Streptococcus thermophilus  in milk, and aspartate availability modulates the level of urease activity.
AB  - We investigated the carbon dioxide metabolism of Streptococcus thermophilus, evaluating the phenotype of a phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase-negative mutant obtained by replacement of a functional ppc gene with a deleted and inactive version, Deltappc. The growth of the mutant was compared to that of the parent strain in a chemically defined medium and in milk, supplemented or not with L-aspartic acid, the final product of the metabolic pathway governed by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. It was concluded that aspartate present in milk is not sufficient for the growth of S. thermophilus. As a consequence, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase activity was considered fundamental for the biosynthesis of L-aspartic acid in S. thermophilus metabolism. This enzymatic activity is therefore essential for growth of S. thermophilus in milk even if S. thermophilus was cultured in association with proteinase-positive Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. It was furthermore observed that the supplementation of milk with aspartate significantly affected the level of urease activity. Further experiments, carried out with a p(ureI)-gusA recombinant strain, revealed that expression of the urease operon was sensitive to the aspartate concentration in milk and to the cell availability of glutamate, glutamine, and ammonium ions.
TI  - [Beneficial effects of consumption of a dairy product containing two probiotic strains, Lactobacillus coryniformis CECT5711 and Lactobacillus gasseri CECT5714 in healthy children].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In the last decades there has been an increasing interest in the manipulation of intestinal microbiota with probiotics for the prevention and treatment of certain paediatric diseases. In addition, it has been suggested that probiotics could play a role in the development of immune system. Recent studies suggest that the administration of two probiotic strains, Lactobacillus coryniformis CECT5711 and Lactobacillus gasseri CECT5714 improves intestinal function of healthy adults and enhances the immune response. Since there are few studies reporting the use of probiotic in children, the main consumers of these products, the aim of the present study was to analyze the effects of the administration of the mentioned probiotic strains in healthy children. INTERVENTIONS: 30 children (age range 3-12) with no gastrointestinal pathology were included in the study. In addition to their usual diet, during the first 3 weeks they received 200 ml of a conventional yogurt containing Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus. During the following three weeks this yogurt was substi-tuted for 80 ml of a probiotic product (Max Defensas, Puleva Food S.L.) containing the same amounts of Streptococcus thermophilus and the L. bulgaricus was substituted by a mixture of the target probiotic strains: L. coryniformis CECT5711 and L. gasseri CECT5714. Samples of faeces and saliva were taken at the beginning of the protocol, at week 3 and at the end of the study. Intestinal microbiota, faecal citotoxicity and the inhibition of Salmonella cholerasusis ssp. cholerasuis adhesion to intestinal mucins by the faeces were analyzed. Finally, IgA concentration was determined in the faecal and saliva samples. RESULTS: Tolerance of the probiotic product was good in all the children included in the study. An increase in faecal lactobacilli counts was shown at the end of the experimental protocol (P < 0,05). In addition citotoxicity of faecal samples was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced after probiotic consumption. The inhibition of S. cholerasuis adhesion to intestinal mucins was significantly higher (P < 0.05) for faecal waters from children in week 6 compared to samples form week 0 and 3. Probiotic consumption was also shown to increase IgA concentration in faeces and saliva (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The consumption of a probiotic product containing L. coryniformis CECT5711 and L. gasseri CECT5714 improves intestinal flora of healthy children, enhancing the defence against gastrointestinal aggressions and infections both by inhibiting pathogen adhesion to intestinal mucins and enhancing the immune function.
TI  - Anti-inflammatory properties of Lactobacillus gasseri expressing manganese superoxide dismutase using the interleukin 10-deficient mouse model of colitis.
AB  - Emerging evidence has implicated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although intestinal epithelial cells produce the ROS-neutralizing enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD), the protein and activity levels of copper/zinc (Cu/Zn) and manganese (Mn) SOD are perturbed in inflamed tissues of IBD patients. Thus we investigated the ability of MnSOD from Streptococcus thermophilus to reduce colitis symptoms in interleukin (IL) 10-deficient mice using Lactobacillus gasseri as a delivery vehicle. Cohorts of 13-15 IL-10-deficient mice were left untreated or supplemented with native L. gasseri or L. gasseri expressing MnSOD for 4 wk. Colonic tissue was collected and inflammation was histologically scored. The presence of innate immune cells was investigated by immunohistochemistry and the host antioxidant response was determined by quantitative PCR. It was demonstrated that L. gasseri was stably maintained in mice for at least 3 days. L. gasseri producing MnSOD significantly reduced inflammation in IL-10-deficient mice compared with untreated controls (P < 0.05), whereas the anti-inflammatory effects of both native and MnSOD producing L. gasseri were more pronounced in males. The anti-inflammatory effects of L. gasseri were associated with a reduction in the infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages. Transcripts of antioxidant genes were equivalent in colonic tissues obtained from control and probiotic-treated IL-10-deficient mice. This study demonstrates that L. gasseri producing MnSOD has significant anti-inflammatory activity that reduces the severity of colitis in the IL-10-deficient mouse.
TI  - [Genetic diversity of the natural strains of Streptococcus thermophilus].
AB  - The method of RAPD-PCR and comparative analysis of the PCR fingerprinting profiles similarity was used to characterize interspecific diversity of natural isolates of the lactic acid bacteria Streptococcus thermophilus. The strain genetic diversity was demonstrated using three primer variants, designed for different bacterial genome regions. The resolution of RAPD-PCR technique with different primers for identification at the species level and for certification at the strain level, was examined relative to the commercially important cultures of S. thermophilus. The results provided conclusion on preferable usage of RAPD-PCR with the primer ERIC-1 for specific identification of S. thermophilus, and with the primer M13 for certification of natural isolates of this species at the strain level.
TI  - Influence of organic buffers on bacteriocin production by Streptococcus thermophilus ST110.
AB  - The effect of the organic buffer salts MES, MOPS, and PIPES on the growth of S. thermophilus ST110, medium pH, and accumulation of the antipediococcal bacteriocin thermophilin 110 were evaluated in whey permeate media over a period of 24 h. In nonbuffered medium, thermophilin 110 production at 37 degrees C paralleled the growth of S. thermophilus ST110 and reached a maximum after 8-10 h. Addition of organic buffer salts decreased the drop in medium pH and resulted in increased biomass (dry cells; microg/mL) and higher yields of thermophilin 110 (units/microg cells). The best results were obtained by the addition of 1% (w/v) MES to the medium, which reduced the pH drop to 1.8 units after 10 h of growth (compared to 2.3 pH units in the control) and resulted in a 1.5-fold increase in cell mass (495 microg/mL) and a 7-fold increase in thermophilin 110 yield (77 units/microg dry cells) over the control. The results showed that whey permeate-based media may be suitable for producing large amounts of thermophilin 110 needed for controlling spoilage pediococci in industrial wine and beer fermentations.
TI  - Optimization of conditions for profiling bacterial populations in food by culture-independent methods.
AB  - In this study we used culture-independent methods to profile bacterial populations in food products. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were employed in order to identify bacterial species without the need of isolation and biochemical identification. The protocols used to extract the DNA, subsequently subjected to PCR amplification for DGGE, as well as the hybridization procedure for FISH, were optimised. Moreover, an extensive study on the primers and probes to be used for the direct detection and identification of microorganisms commonly found in food, was carried out. Meat and cheese samples, fresh or processed, were subjected to DGGE and FISH analysis and the results obtained highlighted how the processing in food industry is decreasing the bacterial biodiversity. Not only processed cheese or meat but also fermented products were dominated by only one or few species. Lactobacillus sakei, Lactobacillus curvatus and Brochothrix thermosphacta were the main species found in meat products, while in cheese(s) Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus and Leuconostoc spp. were repeatedly detected. The results obtained by the two culture-independent methods used always correlated well.
TI  - Use of probiotic Lactobacillus preparation to prevent diarrhoea associated with antibiotics: randomised double blind placebo controlled trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of a probiotic drink containing Lactobacillus for the prevention of any diarrhoea associated with antibiotic use and that caused by Clostridium difficile. DESIGN: Randomised double blind placebo controlled study. PARTICIPANTS: 135 hospital patients (mean age 74) taking antibiotics. Exclusions included diarrhoea on admission, bowel pathology that could result in diarrhoea, antibiotic use in the previous four weeks, severe illness, immunosuppression, bowel surgery, artificial heart valves, and history of rheumatic heart disease or infective endocarditis. INTERVENTION: Consumption of a 100 g (97 ml) drink containing Lactobacillus casei, L bulgaricus, and Streptococcus thermophilus twice a day during a course of antibiotics and for one week after the course finished. The placebo group received a longlife sterile milkshake. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: PRIMARY OUTCOME: occurrence of antibiotic associated diarrhoea. Secondary outcome: presence of C difficile toxin and diarrhoea. RESULTS: 7/57 (12%) of the probiotic group developed diarrhoea associated with antibiotic use compared with 19/56 (34%) in the placebo group (P=0.007). Logistic regression to control for other factors gave an odds ratio 0.25 (95% confidence interval 0.07 to 0.85) for use of the probiotic, with low albumin and sodium also increasing the risk of diarrhoea. The absolute risk reduction was 21.6% (6.6% to 36.6%), and the number needed to treat was 5 (3 to 15). No one in the probiotic group and 9/53 (17%) in the placebo group had diarrhoea caused by C difficile (P=0.001). The absolute risk reduction was 17% (7% to 27%), and the number needed to treat was 6 (4 to 14). CONCLUSION: Consumption of a probiotic drink containing L casei, L bulgaricus, and S thermophilus can reduce the incidence of antibiotic associated diarrhoea and C difficile associated diarrhoea. This has the potential to decrease morbidity, healthcare costs, and mortality if used routinely in patients aged over 50. TRIAL REGISTRATION: National Research Register N0016106821.
TI  - Efficient method for generation of bacteriophage insensitive mutants of Streptococcus thermophilus yoghurt and mozzarella strains.
AB  - Bacteriophage infection of Streptococcus thermophilus is becoming increasingly problematic in many industry fermentations such as yoghurt and mozzarella manufacture. This study describes the development of an efficient and rapid 3-step approach for the generation of bacteriophage insensitive mutants (BIMs) of these starter strains. The method initially involves infection of a culture in solid media at a multiplicity of infection (M.O.I.) of 10 which is then incubated in milk overnight. BIMs are then isolated following successive rounds (20-25) of growth in 10% reconstituted skimmed milk (RSM) in the presence of high phage titres. The method selects for BIMs which can grow efficiently in milk. Using this approach BIMs of two industrial strains were generated, whose starter performance was comparable to the parent starters in terms of performance in milk. Genomic fingerprinting used to validate the identity of each BIM, revealed a number of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) in two of the resultant BIMs. This method provides a simple and reliable method for generation of BIMs of industrial starters which does not require any specialised equipment and should be widely applicable.
TI  - Antiallergic effect of milk fermented with lactic acid bacteria in a murine animal model.
AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the antiallergic effect of fermented milk prepared, respectively, with Streptococcus thermophilus MC, Lactobacillus acidophilus B, Lactobacillus bulgaricus Lb, L. bulgaricus 448, and Bifidobacterium longum B6. Female BALB/c mice fed fermented milk were immunized intraperitoneally with ovalbumin (OVA)/complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) to evaluate the immune response by observing the secretion of cytokines IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-gamma and serum antibody IgE. The results showed that supplementation with lactic acid bacteria fermented milk did not significantly change the IL-2 spontaneous and OVA-stimulated secretions of splenocytes. However, both spontaneous and OVA-stimulated secretions of splenocytes from mice fed lactic acid bacteria fermented milk showed significantly (P < 0.05) lower levels of IL-4 (Th2 cytokine) than those from OVA/CFA-immunized mice fed non-fermented milk (OVA/CFA-milk group). The spontaneous secretion of IFN-gamma (Th1 cytokine) by splenocytes from mice fed L. bulgaricus 448 or L. bulgaricus Lb fermented milk significantly increased as compared to that from the OVA/CFA-milk group. The results showed that the ratios of IFN-gamma to IL-4 of both spontaneous and OVA-stimulated secretions in splenocytes from mice fed lactic acid bacteria fermented milk increased significantly as compared to that of PBS- or OVA/CFA-milk groups. The serum levels of OVA-specific IgE in fermented milk fed groups, especially the group fed S. thermophilus MC fermented milk, were significantly lower than those in the OVA/CFA-milk group through a 6 week feeding experiment. The results showed that milk fermented with lactic acid bacteria demonstrated in vivo antiallergic effects on OVA/CFA-immunized mice via increasing the secretion ratio of IFN-gamma/IL-4 (Th1/Th2) by splenocytes and decreasing the serum level of OVA-specific IgE.
TI  - Comparative sequence analysis of plasmids from Lactobacillus delbrueckii and construction of a shuttle cloning vector.
AB  - While plasmids are very commonly associated with the majority of the lactic acid  bacteria, they are only very rarely associated with Lactobacillus delbrueckii, with only four characterized to date. In this study, the complete sequence of a native plasmid, pDOJ1, from a strain of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus was determined. It consisted of a circular DNA molecule of 6,220 bp with a G+C content of 44.6% and a characteristic ori and encoded six open reading frames (ORFs), of which functions could be predicted for three-a mobilization (Mob) protein, a transposase, and a fused primase-helicase replication protein. Comparative analysis of pDOJ1 and the other available L. delbrueckii plasmids (pLBB1, pJBL2, pN42, and pLL1212) revealed a very similar organization and amino acid identities between 85 and 98% for the putative proteins of all six predicted ORFs from pDOJ1, reflecting a common origin for L. delbrueckii plasmids. Analysis of the fused primase-helicase replication gene found a similar fused organization only in the theta replicating group B plasmids from Streptococcus thermophilus. This observation and the ability of the replicon to function in S. thermophilus support the idea that the origin of plasmids in L. delbrueckii was likely from S. thermophilus. This may reflect the close association of these two species in dairy fermentations, particularly yogurt production. As no vector based on plasmid replicons from L. delbrueckii has previously been constructed, an Escherichia coli-L. delbrueckii shuttle cloning vector, pDOJ4, was constructed from pDOJ1, the p15A ori, the chloramphenicol resistance gene of pCI372, and the lacZ polylinker from pUC18. This cloning vector was successfully introduced into E. coli, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, S. thermophilus, and Lactococcus lactis. This shuttle cloning vector provides a new tool for molecular analysis of Lactobacillus delbrueckii and other lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Effect of a fermented formula on thymus size and stool pH in healthy term infants.
AB  - To investigate the effects of fermented formula (FF) with Bifidobacterium breve C50 and Streptococcus thermophilus 065 on thymus size and stool pH of healthy term infants, ultrasound examinations and evaluations of thymus sizes and thymus indices (TI) and measurements of stool pH were performed in the same 90 term neonates on the 3rd d of life and on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th mo of life. Thirty newborns were exclusively breast-fed while the remaining 60 were randomly assigned to receive either a FF or a standard formula (SF). The fecal pH of the breast-fed group was lower than the SF group (p < 0.05), although it was similar to that of the FF group on the third postnatal day, persisting for the entire 4 mo of the study. The difference in TI was statistically significant over repeated measurements among the groups. The FF infants showed a TI similar to the breast-fed newborns. Probiotic fermentation products have effects comparable to those of the bacteria composing the intestinal microflora supporting the idea that intestinal bacterial balance plays an important role in improving host immune responses.
TI  - Production of gamma-aminobutyric acid by Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus Y2 under submerged fermentation.
AB  - Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, has several well-known physiological functions and has been applied to the production of many drugs and functional foods. The technology of GABA production via submerged fermentation by Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus Y2 was investigated in this paper. It indicated that the GABA production was related to the biochemical characteristics of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) of S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus Y2. After 24 h of fermentation at 37 degrees C, which is the suitable culture conditions for GAD-production, then the culture condition were adjusted to the optimal temperature (40 degrees C) and pH (4.5) for the GAD reaction activity in biotransformation of cells and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (0.02 mmol/l) were added to the broth at the 48 h, the GABA production was increased up to 1.76-fold, reaching 7984.75 +/- 293.33 mg/l. The strain shows great potential use as a starter for GABA-containing yoghurt, cheese and other functional fermented food productions.
TI  - Identification of a novel streptococcal gene cassette mediating SOS mutagenesis in Streptococcus uberis.
AB  - Streptococci have been considered to lack the classical SOS response, defined by  increased mutation after UV exposure and regulation by LexA. Here we report the identification of a potential self-regulated SOS mutagenesis gene cassette in the Streptococcaceae family. Exposure to UV light was found to increase mutations to antibiotic resistance in Streptococcus uberis cultures. The mutational spectra revealed mainly G:C-->A:T transitions, and Northern analyses demonstrated increased expression of a Y-family DNA polymerase resembling UmuC under DNA-damaging conditions. In the absence of the Y-family polymerase, S. uberis cells were sensitive to UV light and to mitomycin C. Furthermore, the UV-induced mutagenesis was almost completely abolished in cells deficient in the Y-family polymerase. The gene encoding the Y-family polymerase was localized in a four-gene operon including two hypothetical genes and a gene encoding a HdiR homolog. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that S. uberis HdiR binds specifically to an inverted repeat sequence in the promoter region of the four-gene operon. Database searches revealed conservation of the gene cassette in several Streptococcus species, including at least one genome each of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Streptococcus thermophilus strains. In addition, the umuC operon was localized in several mobile DNA elements of Streptococcus and Lactococcus species. We conclude that the hdiR-umuC-ORF3-ORF4 operon represents a novel gene cassette capable of mediating SOS mutagenesis among members of the Streptococcaceae.
TI  - Analysis of two theta-replicating plasmids of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - We report the characterization of two new theta-replicating plasmids of Streptococcus thermophilus (pSMQ-312b and pSMQ-316) as well as the further analysis of pSMQ-308. The nucleotide sequences of pSMQ-312b and pSMQ-316 were determined and both contained 6710 bp. In fact, the two sequences were identical, despite that the plasmids were isolated from two different S. thermophilus strains as demonstrated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Comparative analyses indicated that the two plasmids were highly related to the previously characterized S. thermophilus plasmid pSMQ-308 (8144 bp). Plasmid stability tests showed that pSMQ-312b/316 was more stable in LM17 medium while pSMQ-308 was the most stable in milk. The presence of the plasmids did not modify the acidification profile of the S. thermophilus strains during growth in milk and under time-temperature conditions mimicking an industrial process. These theta-replicating plasmids are unique genetic material for the construction of stable cloning vectors for industrially relevant strains of S. thermophilus.
TI  - Rapid restoration of colonic goblet cells induced by a hydrolyzed diet containing probiotics in experimental malnutrition.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of the addition of probiotic bacteria to a hydrolyzed diet on the recovery of goblet cells during renutrition in an animal model of malnutrition. METHODS: Twenty-six male Wistar rats (200-250g) were included in the study. Six were kept under normal conditions (sham group) while twenty received an aproteic diet for 15 days, and were randomized thereafter to receive a hydrolyzed diet containing (n=6; probiotic group) or not (n=6; hydrolyzed group) probiotics (10(6) cfu/g of Streptococcus thermophilus e Lactobacillus helveticus); or immediately killed (n=8; aproteic group). Histological slides containing cecal and sigmoid biopsies were used to counting the number of goblet cells and the goblet cells/colonocytes ratio. RESULTS: Malnutrition diminished the population of goblet cells in all sites. Goblet cells/colonocytes ratio of the probiotic group was significantly greater than hydrolyzed group at the ceccum (0.39 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.34 +/-0.02; p=0.02). Only rats fed with probiotics showed complete restoration of the normal goblet cells/colonocytes ratio at the sigmoid (0.37 +/- 0,02 vs. 0.22 +/- 0,03; p<0,001). CONCLUSION: Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus helveticus added to a renutrition diet enhance the recovery of mucosal atrophy induced by malnutrition and especially induce a rapid restoration of goblet cells population in the malnourished colonic mucosa.
TI  - [Effect of probiotic lactic acid bacteria strains on virus infection].
AB  - The effect of probiotic lactic acid bacteria strains on viral infection was studied in experiments in vivo. It was shown that in investigations microbial substance based on living cells of L. plantarum and S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus strains manifested antiinfluenzal activity under administration of 0.3 ml of cultural medium per os at a dose of 3 x 10(8)/CFU mouse and antiherpetic activity at a dose of 0.3 x 10(9)/CFU mouse. The probiotic effectiveness was shown on the model of genital herpes of guinea-pigs at concentration of 1 x 10(9) cells/g.p. It was statistically established, that the lactic acid bacteria inhibited reproduction of HIV at a dose of cells of 0.1 x 10(9)/CFU ml.
TI  - Transport capabilities of eleven gram-positive bacteria: comparative genomic analyses.
AB  - The genomes of eleven Gram-positive bacteria that are important for human health  and the food industry, nine low G+C lactic acid bacteria and two high G+C Gram-positive organisms, were analyzed for their complement of genes encoding transport proteins. Thirteen to 18% of their genes encode transport proteins, larger percentages than observed for most other bacteria. All of these bacteria possess channel proteins, some of which probably function to relieve osmotic stress. Amino acid uptake systems predominate over sugar and peptide cation symporters, and of the sugar uptake porters, those specific for oligosaccharides and glycosides often outnumber those for free sugars. About 10% of the total transport proteins are constituents of putative multidrug efflux pumps with Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS)-type pumps (55%) being more prevalent than ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-type pumps (33%), which, however, usually greatly outnumber all other types. An exception to this generalization is Streptococcus thermophilus with 54% of its drug efflux pumps belonging to the ABC superfamily and 23% belonging each to the Multidrug/Oligosaccharide/Polysaccharide (MOP) superfamily and the MFS. These bacteria also display peptide efflux pumps that may function in intercellular signalling, and macromolecular efflux pumps, many of predictable specificities. Most of the bacteria analyzed have no pmf-coupled or transmembrane flow electron carriers. The one exception is Brevibacterium linens, which in addition to these carriers, also has transporters of several families not represented in the other ten bacteria examined. Comparisons with the genomes of organisms from other bacterial kingdoms revealed that lactic acid bacteria possess distinctive proportions of recognized transporter types (e.g., more porters specific for glycosides than reducing sugars). Some homologues of transporters identified had previously been identified only in Gram-negative bacteria or in eukaryotes. Our studies reveal unique characteristics of the lactic acid bacteria such as the universal presence of genes encoding mechanosensitive channels, competence systems and large numbers of sugar transporters of the phosphotransferase system. The analyses lead to important physiological predictions regarding the preferred signalling and metabolic activities of these industrially important bacteria.
TI  - Possible mechanisms of antimutagenicity in fermented soymilk prepared with a coculture of Streptococcus infantis and Bifidobacterium infantis.
AB  - The possible mechanisms of antimutagenicity against 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide (4-NQO; a direct mutagen) and 3,2'-dimethyl-4-amino-biphenyl (DMAB; an indirect mutagen) were examined in fermented soymilk prepared with a coculture of Streptococcus thermophilus and Bifidobacterium infantis. The antimutagenicity in the fermented soymilk was not due to the bioantimutagenic effect of modulation of DNA repair processes. The mutagenicity of DMAB decreased with increased preincubation of fermented soymilk and the DMAB metabolite but not with intact DMAB or an S9 mixture. Mutagenicity of 4-NQO was not affected by preincubation of fermented soymilk with this mutagen. Mutagenicity of both 4-NQO and DMAB was reduced when Salmonella Typhimurium TA 100 was pretreated with fermented soymilk, indicating that fermented soymilk affected the function of the bacterial cell, which might also lead to reduced mutagenicity of the tested mutagens. Desmutagenic and blocking effects were the main mechanisms of antimutagenicity in the fermented soymilk against DMBA. In contrast, the antimutagenic effect of the fermented soymilk on 4-NQO was primarily due to a blocking effect.
TI  - Novel optimal temperature profile for acidification process of Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus in yoghurt fermentation using artificial neural network and genetic algorithm.
AB  - The acidification behavior of Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus for yoghurt production was investigated along temperature profiles within the optimal window of 38-44 degrees C. For the optimal acidification temperature profile search, an optimization engine module built on a modular artificial neural network (ANN) and genetic algorithm (GA) was used. Fourteen batches of yoghurt fermentations were evaluated using different temperature profiles in order to train and validate the ANN sub-module. The ANN captured the nonlinear relationship between temperature profiles and acidification patterns on training data after 150 epochs. This served as an evaluation function for the GA. The acidification slope of the temperature profile was the performance index. The GA sub-module iteratively evolved better temperature profiles across generations using GA operations. The stopping criterion was met after 11 generations. The optimal profile showed an acidification slope of 0.06117 compared to an initial value of 0.0127 and at a set point sequence of 43, 38, 44, 43, and 39 degrees C. Laboratory evaluation of three replicates of the GA suggested optimum profile of 43, 38, 44, 43, and 39 degrees C gave an average slope of 0.04132. The optimization engine used (to be published elsewhere) could effectively search for optimal profiles of different physico-chemical parameters of fermentation processes.
TI  - Conjugated linoleic acid conversion by dairy bacteria cultured in MRS broth and buffalo milk.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate strains of Lactobacilli, Bifidobacteria and Streptococci for their ability to produce conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) from free linoleic acid (LA). METHODS AND RESULTS: Eight dairy bacteria tolerant to LA were grown in MRS broth containing LA (200 microg ml(-1)) and CLA was assessed. Seven bacteria were able to form CLA after 24 h of incubation, varying percentage conversion between 17% and 36%. Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium bifidum and Streptococcus thermophilus showed the highest LA conversion and were inoculated into buffalo milk supplemented with different concentration of LA. The production of CLA at 200 microg ml(-1) of LA was two- or threefold in milk than MRS broth. All evaluated strains were able to produce CLA from high LA levels (1000 microg ml(-1)). CONCLUSIONS: The most tolerant strain to LA was Lact. casei. Lacttobacillus rhamnosus produced the maximum level of CLA at high LA concentrations (800 microg ml(-1)). The selected bacteria may be considered as adjunct cultures to be included on dairy fermented products manufacture. Low concentration of LA must be added to the medium to enhance CLA formation. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The production of CLA by strains using milks from regional farms as medium offer a possible mechanism to enhance this beneficial compound in dairy products and those the possibility to develop functional foods.
TI  - Selection and properties of alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase-deficient spontaneous mutants of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Many lactic acid bacteria produce diacetyl, which is a desirable aroma compound in some fermented dairy products. Strains or mutants of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis biovar. diacetylactis that are deficient in alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase are used in some food processes for their ability to produce large amounts of diacetyl. However, up until now, the use of alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase-deficient mutants of Streptococcus thermophilus for increased diacetyl production has not been evaluated. The objective of the present study was to devise a procedure for selecting spontaneous alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase-deficient mutants of S. thermophilus. We observed that in a chemically defined medium (CDM) containing alpha-ketobutyrate plus leucine, or alpha-ketobutyrate plus leucine plus isoleucine, the alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase-deficient mutant TIL865, obtained by directed mutagenesis, grew faster than its parent strain. This property was used for selecting spontaneous alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase-deficient mutants on agar plates. The resulting mutants were able to grow in milk, and their acidifying activity was slightly lower than that of the parent strain. Under partial anaerobic or aerobic conditions, they produced approximately three times more diacetyl than the parent strain. Such spontaneous mutants may be useful for increasing the diacetyl content of fermented milks whose production involves S. thermophilus strains.
TI  - A widespread picture of the Streptococcus thermophilus proteome by cell lysate fractionation and gel-based/gel-free approaches.
AB  - Among the group of lactic acid bacteria, Streptococcus thermophilus has found a wide application in industrial processes used for the manufacture of dairy products. Taking advantage of different proteome extraction and subfractionation protocols, bacterial cytosolic and membrane proteins were isolated and resolved by independent gel-free and gel-based separation procedures. Whole cytosolic fraction and its acid, basic and low molecular mass protein components were separated by different resolutive 2-DE and tricine 1-DE gels and identified by MALDI-TOF PMF and/or microLC-ESI-IT-MS/MS. Membrane proteins were resolved by 2-DE and SDS-PAGE gels and similarly identified by PMF and TMS analysis. In parallel, whole extract was trypsinized and resulting peptides were identified by shotgun 2-D LC-ESI-IT-MS/MS analysis. Using this combined approach, expression products corresponding to 458 different genes were identified, which cover almost a third of the predicted vegetative proteome. Relative protein concentration and hydrophobicity affected protein detection. Broad recognition was obtained for enzymes involved in carbohydrate, fatty acid, amino acid and nucleotide metabolism, replication, transcription, translation, cell wall synthesis, as well as for proteins affecting bacterial functions important for industrial applications, i.e. milk sugar import and exopolysaccharide biosynthesis. By providing detailed reference electrophoretic/chromatographic maps to be used in future comparative proteomic investigations on bacteria grown under various experimental conditions or on different bacterial strains, our results will favour dedicated studies on S. thermophilus metabolism and its regulation or on detection of biomarkers for selection of optimal strains for industrial applications.
TI  - [Adhesion of various species of lactic acid bacteria depending on the AB0 system  blood group].
AB  - The influence of the AB0 blood groups on adhesion of different lactic acid bacteria species was studied. From twelve investigated strains of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. plantarum and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus species, difference between adhesion average index on erythrocytes of various blood groups was found in two strains. The average adhesion index of the strain E. faecium K-50 in A (II) blood group erythrocytes was higher (AAI = 4.91 +/- 0.26) than in B (III) blood group erythrocytes (AAI = 4.17 +/- 0.33). The strain L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 4n has displayed a higher adhesive activity in A (II) blood group erythrocytes (AAI = 4.36 +/- 0.13) in comparison with AB (III) blood group erythrocytes (AAI = 3.61 +/- 0.75).
TI  - Characterization of a bacteriocin, Thermophilin 1277, produced by Streptococcus thermophilus SBT1277.
AB  - AIMS: To assess the inhibitory activity and the influence of culture condition on the growth and bacteriocin, Thermophilin 1277, production by Streptococcus thermophilus SBT1277. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thermophilin 1277, which was produced by S. thermophilus SBT1277, showed an antimicrobial activity against several lactic acid bacteria and food spoilage bacteria including Clostridium butylicum, C. sprogenes and Bacillus cereus. Thermophilin 1277 was inactivated by proteinase K. Heating treatment did not affect the antimicrobial activity. The partially purified Thermophilin 1277 had an apparent molecular mass of 3.7 kDa. N-terminal sequence analysis revealed 15 amino acid residues that correspond with amino acid sequence of the lantibiotics bovicin HJ50 produced by Streptococcus bovis HJ50. The effects of culture condition for the bacteriocin production by S. thermophilus SBT1277 were studied. During the batch fermentation, Thermophilin 1277 was produced in M17 broth, but no bacteriocin production occurred in the sucrose-tryptone (ST) broth. Bacteriocin production was detected in pH controlled ST broth at pH values of 5.5-6.5. CONCLUSIONS: Thermophilin 1277 production from S. thermophilus strain depended on the culture conditions. Some characters and N-terminal amino acid sequence of Thermophilin 1277 differed from bacteriocins produced by S. thermophilus reported previously. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Streptococcus thermophilus SBT1277 or its bacteriocin which has a wide inhibitory spectrum has a potential use as a biopreservative in dairy products.
TI  - CRISPR provides acquired resistance against viruses in prokaryotes.
AB  - Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) are a distinctive feature of the genomes of most Bacteria and Archaea and are thought to be involved in resistance to bacteriophages. We found that, after viral challenge, bacteria integrated new spacers derived from phage genomic sequences. Removal or addition of particular spacers modified the phage-resistance phenotype of the cell. Thus, CRISPR, together with associated cas genes, provided resistance against phages, and resistance specificity is determined by spacer-phage sequence similarity.

TI  - Probiotics--the friendly bacteria with market potential in global market.
AB  - With the growing interest in self-care and integrative medicine coupled with our  health-embracing increasing population, recognition of the link between diet and health has never been stronger. As a result, the market for functional foods, or foods that promote health beyond providing basic nutrition, is flourishing. Within the functional foods movement is the small but rapidly expanding arena of probiotics - live microbial food supplements that beneficially affect an individual by improving intestinal microbial balance. The consumers' overwhelming interest in and demand for functional foods, including probiotics, make it imperative that health professionals stay abreast of the latest research findings and available products. The global market for functional foods in the coming years is predicted to grow rapidly. Although Japan currently accounts for about one-half of this market, the fastest rate of growth is expected to be in the United States. Probiotic products represent a strong growth area within the functional foods group and intense research efforts are under way to develop dairy products into which probiotic organisms such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species are incorporated. Such probiotic foods may modulate gut microbial composition, thereby leading to improved gut health, for example, through improved tolerance to lactose in lactose-intolerant individuals or improved resistance to pathogenic bacteria. The fast-growing probiotics market holds a wealth of opportunities, especially for those companies that understand and cater for the final consumer. This monograph provides a summary of research on the health benefits of probiotics and offers information regarding the global market potential of probiotics.
TI  - Studies on bacteriocin (thermophilin T) production by Streptococcus thermophilus  ACA-DC 0040 in batch and fed-batch fermentation modes.
AB  - Growth conditions that support bacteriocin (thermophilin T) production by Streptococcus thermophilus ACA-DC 0040 were identified. Synthesis of thermophilin T occurred during primary metabolic growth, while its specific rate of synthesis seemed to be optimal at T = 30 degrees C. Thermophilin T activity rapidly decreased in the stationary phase, especially at high growth temperature (i.e. T = 42 degrees C). In media with high content of complex nitrogen sources, high amounts of bacteriocin were detected in the growth environment, while about an 8-fold increase of thermophilin T titer and a 2-fold increase of specific synthesis rate was achieved when a fed-batch fermentation mode was applied.
TI  - Influence of the dairy environment on gene expression and substrate utilization in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are widely used for the industrial production of fermented dairy products and form a group of related low-GC-content gram-positive bacteria. The major species used in dairy manufacturing are Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Streptococcus, and Leuconostoc. Traditionally most are applied as starter cultures for dairy fermentations or used as probiotic cultures, delivered in dairy vehicles. The appearance of the genomes of Lactococcus lactis, Bidifobacterium longum, Lactobacillus plantarum, L. johnsonii, L. acidophilus, 2 strains of Streptococcus thermophilus, and pending completion of many draft genomic sequences, is now promoting in-depth investigation into the comparative genetic content of LAB. Moreover, whole-genome transcriptional arrays are quickly revealing critical genes/operons that are coordinately expressed and the impact of environmental factors on expression of multiple gene sets. Comparative genomics between multiple genomes is providing insights into genes that are important in metabolic, physiological, and functional roles for different LAB in the environments they inhabit, ranging from the gastrointestinal tract to milk and acidified dairy products.
TI  - Complete genome sequence of the prototype lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363.
AB  - Lactococcus lactis is of great importance for the nutrition of hundreds of millions of people worldwide. This paper describes the genome sequence of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363, the lactococcal strain most intensively studied throughout the world. The 2,529,478-bp genome contains 81 pseudogenes and encodes 2,436 proteins. Of the 530 unique proteins, 47 belong to the COG (clusters of orthologous groups) functional category "carbohydrate metabolism and transport," by far the largest category of novel proteins in comparison with L. lactis subsp. lactis IL1403. Nearly one-fifth of the 71 insertion elements are concentrated in a specific 56-kb region. This integration hot-spot region carries genes that are typically associated with lactococcal plasmids and a repeat sequence specifically found on plasmids and in the "lateral gene transfer hot spot" in the genome of Streptococcus thermophilus. Although the parent of L. lactis MG1363 was used to demonstrate lysogeny in Lactococcus, L. lactis MG1363 carries four remnant/satellite phages and two apparently complete prophages. The availability of the L. lactis MG1363 genome sequence will reinforce its status as the prototype among lactic acid bacteria through facilitation of further applied and fundamental research.
TI  - Perioperative administration of probiotics: effects on immune response, anastomotic resistance and colonic mucosal trophism.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of perioperative administration of diet containing probiotics on the immune response, anastomotic resistance, and colonic mucosal trophism in rats underwent left-sided colonic anastomosis. METHODS: Sixty adults Wistar rats were randomized to two groups (A and B) with 30 animals each to receive or not a diet supplemented with probiotics (Streptococcus thermophilus e Lactobacillus helveticus) during pre- and postoperative period. They underwent laparotomy followed by left colon section and immediate anastomosis. Groups of 15 animals were killed either on the 4th (groups A1 and B1) or 7th PO (groups A2 and B2) days. The outcome variables were serum proteins, albumin, globulins and IgA, length and weight of the colon, mucosal weight, DNA content and anastomotic bursting pressure. RESULTS: Colonic weight was greater in probiotic group compared to controls (1.69+/-0.34 g vs 1.48+/-0.26 g; p<0.05). Total serum proteins and globulin were higher in probiotic animals (proteins = 7.05+/-0.97 g/dl vs 6.57+/-0.66 g/dl e globulins = 5.1+/-0.62 g/dl vs 4.68+/-1.1 g/dl; p<0.05). Serum IgA increased from basal to post-operative days only in the probiotic group (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative probiotics enhanced the immune response and colonic weight. Probiotics failed to increase anastomotic resistance.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a new plasmid pSpnP1 from a multidrug-resistant clone of Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - A novel Streptococcus pneumoniae plasmid (pSpnP1; 5413bp) has been isolated from  the multidrug-resistant clone Poland(23F)-16, and its complete nucleotide sequence has been determined. Sequence analysis predicted seven co-directional open reading frames and comparative analyses revealed that plasmid pSpnP1 is different to pDP1, the only previously described pneumococcal plasmid, whereas it is highly similar to pSt08, a plasmid from Streptococcus thermophilus. A double-stranded origin for replication similar to the replication origin of the pC194/pUB110 family was located upstream of the putative rep gene (orf2). It also contained a 144-bp region with over 60% identity to the single-stranded origin type A of the Streptococcus agalactiae plasmid pMV158/pLS1. Detection of single-stranded DNA by Southern blot analysis indicated that pSpnP1 replicates via a rolling circle mechanism. Interestingly, the product of orf1 has a putative Zonular occludens toxin conserved domain present in toxigenic strains of Vibrio cholerae. Real-time PCR assays revealed that this ORF was expressed. Hybridization experiments showed that the pSpnP1 replicon was unusual among other examined antibiotic-resistant pneumococcal clones, although the recombinant plasmids based on pSpnP1 were able to replicate in Bacillus subtilis and Lactococcus lactis.
TI  - Biopreservation by Lactobacillus paracasei in coculture with Streptococcus thermophilus in potentially probiotic and synbiotic fresh cream cheeses.
AB  - The viability of Lactobacillus paracasei and its effect on growth of the microbiota in potentially probiotic and synbiotic fresh cheeses during storage at 4 +/- 1 degree C was investigated. Three cheese-making trials (T1, T2, and T3) were prepared in quadruplicate, all supplemented with a Streptococcus thermophilus culture. L. paracasei subsp. paracasei was added to cheeses in T1 and T2, and inulin was added to cheeses in T2. Counts of L. paracasei, S. thermophilus, coliforms, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus spp., DNase-positive Staphylococcus, and yeasts and molds were monitored during storage for up to 21 days. Viable counts of L. paracasei in probiotic (T1) and synbiotic (T2) cheeses remained above 7 log CFU/g during the entire storage period, whereas counts of S. thermophilus remained above 9.5 log CFU/g for cheeses from TI, T2, and T3. Populations of coliforms, Staphylococcus spp., and DNase-positive Staphylococcus were higher in T3 cheese and differed significantly from those in cheeses from T1 and T2 (P < 0.05). Inhibition of contaminants prevailed when both L. paracasei and S. thermophilus were present in fresh cream cheese and probably was due to acid production by both strains; bacteriocin production was not found. Addition of inulin in T2 did not impact microbial viability (P > 0.05). L. paracasei subsp. paracasei in coculture with S. thermophilus was inhibitory against microbial contaminants in fresh cream cheese with or without the addition of inulin, indicating the potential use of this combination in a probiotic and synbiotic product.
TI  - Spotlight on VSL#3 probiotic mixture in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.
AB  - VSL#3 (VSL#3) is a high-concentration probiotic preparation of eight live freeze-dried bacterial species that are normal components of the human gastrointestinal microflora, including four strains of lactobacilli (Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), three strains of bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium longum, B. breve, and B. infantis), and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. Data from noncomparative trials suggest that VSL#3 has clinical potential in the treatment of active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and as maintenance therapy for patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. In addition, a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial showed that VSL#3 in combination with low-dose balsalazide (a prodrug of mesalazine [mesalamine; 5-aminosalicylic acid]) was more effective than standard doses of basalazide or mesalazine monotherapy in the treatment of acute mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown VSL#3 is effective in preventing the onset of acute pouchitis in patients with newly formed surgical pouches, and in maintaining remission following antibacterial treatment of acute pouchitis in patients with a history of refractory or recurrent pouchitis. Treatment guidelines from the US and the UK include VSL#3 as a therapeutic option for the prevention of pouchitis relapse in patients with chronic pouchitis. In general, VSL#3 was well tolerated in clinical trials. Large, well designed, controlled confirmatory clinical trials will further determine the place of VSL#3 in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.
TI  - Production of yoghurt with mild taste by a Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus mutant with altered proteolytic properties.
AB  - In this communication, we describe the isolation of a Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 92063 mutant strain named pH-P11, which differed from the parent strain by low proteolytic activity and altered regulation of expression of lacZ in the presence of glucose or lactose. In the presence of lactose, beta-galactosidase activity was approximately twice as high in pH-P11 than in the wild type. pH-P11 exhibited protosymbiosis together with Streptococcus thermophilus. Yoghurt produced with pH-P11 was characterized by low acidity and little post-acidification during storage. The organoleptic properties (absence of bitterness and other off-flavors, weak sourness, and clear yoghurt taste) were those of a typical "yoghurt mild". This mild flavor was achieved at rather high cell counts of lactobacilli even at the end of shelf-life. High cell counts in conjunction with high beta-galactosidase activity make pH-P11 an interesting strain for application in yoghurt especially designed for consumers with lactose malabsorption. In contrast to "yoghurt mild", which is predominantly produced with Lactobacillus acidophilus together with Streptococcus thermophilus, the product obtained by fermentation with pH-P11 and Streptococcus thermophilus concurs with international standards for yoghurt. During frequent sub-culturing, strain pH-P11, which is supposed to differ from the wild type by one or a few so-far-not-characterized mutations, showed sufficient stability for application in industrial production.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus from plants in Bulgaria.
AB  - One of the traditional ways of preparation of yogurt starter in Bulgaria is placing a branch of a particular plant species into boiled sheep's milk maintained at about 45 degrees C, which is further incubated until a dense coagulum is obtained. To investigate the possible origin of the yogurt starter bacteria, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (L. bulgaricus) and Streptococcus thermophilus (S. thermophilus), the traditional way of yogurt-starter preparation was followed. Hundreds of plant samples were collected from four regions in Bulgaria and incubated in sterile skim milk. The two target bacteria at low frequencies from the plant samples collected were successfully isolated. Phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of these bacterial isolates revealed that they were identified as L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus. Twenty isolates of L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus, respectively, were selected from the isolated strains and further characterized with regard to their performance in yogurt production. Organoleptic and physical properties of yogurt prepared using the isolated strains from plants were not significantly different from those prepared using commercial yogurt-starter strains. It was therefore suggested that L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus strains widely used for commercial yogurt production could have originated from plants in Bulgaria. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the isolation and characterization of L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus strains from plants.
TI  - [Reversion of antibiotic-sensitivity of lactic acid bacteria in grafted cultures  of lymphoblastoid human cells].
AB  - The reversion of the antibiotic sensitivity of lactic acid bacteria: Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus plantarum have been studied. The phenomenon of the reversion has been fists studied in lactic acid bacteria of different taxonomic groups at their interactions with lymphoblastoid human cells. It is shown that resistance of lactobacteria to antibiotics can change depending on the terms of cultivation, genus and strain specificity. Most often the reversion of antibiotic sensitivity was observed with respect to fuzidin (26%) and cefepim (23%), most rarely--with respect to cephazolin, erithromicin, cefamandol, tobramicin and oxacillin.
TI  - Acid adaptation affects the viability of Salmonella typhimurium during the lactic fermentation of skim milk and product storage.
AB  - In this study, Salmonella typhimurium was acid adapted at pH 5.5 for 4 h. The viability of the acid-adapted and non-adapted cells of S. typhimurium was investigated both during the lactic fermentation of skim milk with Streptococcus thermophilus or Lactobacillus bulgaricus, and during the storage of lactic fermented milk products at 5 degrees C. It was found that the viable population of S. typhimurium, regardless of acid adaptation, increased in skim milk during the initial 24 h of lactic fermentation and then declined. However, the viable population of acid-adapted S. typhimurium was significantly higher (P<.05) than that of non-adapted cell at the end of 48 h of fermentation. Acid-adapted cells of S. typhimurium were also found to have survived better than non-adapted cells in the S. thermophilus-prepared fermented milk and two commercial lactic fermented milk products. The viability of the acid-adapted and non-adapted S. typhimurium at 5 and 37 degrees C in cell-free fermented milks that had their pHs adjusted to 6.4 and skim milk (pH 6.4) was further investigated. Results revealed that acid adaptation, in addition to enhancing acid tolerance, reduced the susceptibility of S. typhimurium to refrigerated temperature and other detrimental factors which might be present in lactic fermented milk products. These responses all contribute to the enhanced survival of acid-adapted S. typhimurium in the lactic fermented milk products observed in the present study.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance of lactic acid bacteria and Bifidobacterium spp. isolated from dairy and pharmaceutical products.
AB  - The outlines of antibiotic resistance of some probiotic microorganisms were studied. This study was conducted with the double purpose of verifying their ability to survive if they are taken simultaneously with an antibiotic therapy and to increase the selective properties of suitable media for the isolation of samples containing mixed bacterial populations. We isolated from commercial dairy and pharmaceutical products, 34 strains declared as probiotics, belonging to the genera Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, and 21 strains of starter culture bacteria. All the microorganisms have been compared by electrophoresis of the soluble proteins for the purpose of identifying them. A Multiplex-PCR with genus- and species-specific primers was used to detect for Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis presence. All bifidobacteria were B. animalis subsp. lactis except one Bifidobacterium longum. Sometimes the identification showed that the used strain was not the one indicated on the label. The lactobacilli were Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. The streptococci were all Streptococcus thermophilus. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 24 common antibiotic substances has been valued by the broth microdilution method. All tested strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, clindamycin, dicloxacillin, erytromycin, novobiocin, penicillin G, rifampicin (MIC(90) ranging from 0.01 to 4 microg/ml); resistant to aztreonam, cycloserin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, polymyxin B and spectinomycin (MIC(90) ranging from 64 to >1000 microg/ml). The susceptibility to cephalothin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, lincomycin, metronidazole, neomycin, paromomycin, streptomycin, tetracycline and vancomycin was variable and depending on the species.
TI  - Characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the one humped camel milk  produced in Morocco.
AB  - One hundred and twenty (120) strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were enumerated and isolated from raw dromedary milk in Morocco using various cultured media. Strains isolated were characterized by phenotypic, physiological and biochemical properties. Results showed that high counts of LAB were found. Presumptive lactobacilli counts ranged from 2.5x10(2) to 6x10(7)cfu/ml, presumptive lactococci levels varied from 5x10(2) to 6x10(7)cfu/ml, presumptive streptococci counts varied from 4.2x10(2) to 8x10(7)cfu/ml, presumptive leuconostoc levels ranged from 5.4x10(2) to 5.4x10(7)cfu/ml. Results showed also that Lactobacillus and Lactococcus were the predominant genera with 37.5% and 25.8%, respectively. The dominated species found were Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (17.5%), Lactobacillus helveticus (10%), Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus (9.20%), Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei (5.80%) and Lactobacillus plantarum (5%). This is the first report on the characterization of LAB strains isolated from the one humped camel milk produced in Morocco.
TI  - Nonstarter lactobacilli isolated from soft and semihard Argentinean cheeses: genetic characterization and resistance to biological barriers.
AB  - Nonstarter lactic acid bacteria isolated from Argentinean cheeses were identified and characterized by focusing on their resistance to biological barriers, along with other physiological features of potential interest, in the search for future probiotic organisms. Lactobacilli were enumerated and isolated from semihard and soft cheeses made with multistrain Streptococcus thermophilus starters. Lactobacilli counts in 1-week-old cheeses were between 10(5) and 10(7) CFU/g and then reached 10(7) CFU/ g in all 1-month samples, while streptococci were always above 10(9) CFU/g. A total number of 22 lactobacilli isolates were retained, identified, and characterized by in vitro tests. Species identity was determined by carbohydrate metabolism and species-specific PCR assays. Genetic diversity was explored by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) PCR analysis. The Lactobacillus strains were assigned to the species L. casei, L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus, L. curvatus, L. fermentum, and L. perolens. All the strains studied tolerated 25 ppm of lysozyme, and most of them showed resistance to 0.3% bile. After incubation in gastric solution (pH 2.0), counts decreased by several log units, ranging from 3.2 to 7.0. The strains were able to grow in the presence of bile salts, but only three isolates were capable of deconjugation. The nonstarter lactobacilli that were assayed fermented the prebiotic substrates (especially lactulose and inulin). Some strains showed high cell hydrophobicity and beta-galactosidase activity, as well as inhibitory activity against pathogenic bacteria. It was concluded that most of the lactobacilli isolated in this study demonstrated resistance to biological barriers and physiological characteristics compatible with probiotic properties, which make them suitable for further research in in vivo studies aimed at identifying new probiotic organisms.
TI  - [Intake of fermented milk containing Lactobacillus casei DN-114 001 and its effect on gut flora].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the gut flora in infants who received fermented milk containing Lactobacillus casei and Streptococcus termophilus and its effect on secretory immunoglobulin levels. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An experimental, randomized, prospective, parallel group study was carried out. Thirty-five infants were included (18 in the treatment group and 17 in the control group) with a mean age of 2 years (SD: 0.6 years; range: 1-3 years). The experimental group received both fermented milk (0.5 l/day) containing L. casei and S. termophilus for 6 weeks and standard cow's milk for the following 6 weeks. The control group received standard cow's milk (0.5 l/day) for 12 weeks. Secretory IgA levels in saliva were evaluated in the experimental group at the start of the study (baseline levels) and 6 weeks later. In both groups, stools were collected to study gut flora at 0, 6 and 12 week. RESULTS: Secretory IgA levels significantly increased (p =0.0063) from a mean baseline value of 2.5 mg/dl to a mean of 3.4 mg/dl at 6 weeks. Gram-negative aerobic flora were decreased in the experimental group after 6 weeks compared with the control group (p =0.0203). The number of infants with Lactobacillus spp in their gut flora was greater in the experimental group than in the control group at week 6 and this difference was statistically significant (p =0.028) at week 12. Conclusion The present study provides evidence of L. casei survival in the gastrointestinal tract and of its effect of increasing secretory IgA.
TI  - First complete genome sequence of two Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteriophages.
AB  - Staphylococcus epidermidis is an important opportunistic pathogen causing nosocomial infections and is often associated with infections in patients with implanted prosthetic devices. A number of virulence determinants have been identified in S. epidermidis, which are typically acquired through horizontal gene transfer. Due to the high recombination potential, bacteriophages play an important role in these transfer events. Knowledge of phage genome sequences provides insights into phage-host biology and evolution. We present the complete genome sequence and a molecular characterization of two S. epidermidis phages, phiPH15 (PH15) and phiCNPH82 (CNPH82). Both phages belonged to the Siphoviridae family and produced stable lysogens. The PH15 and CNPH82 genomes displayed high sequence homology; however, our analyses also revealed important functional differences. The PH15 genome contained two introns, and in vivo splicing of phage mRNAs was demonstrated for both introns. Secondary structures for both introns were also predicted and showed high similarity to those of Streptococcus thermophilus phage 2972 introns. An additional finding was differential superinfection inhibition between the two phages that corresponded with differences in nucleotide sequence and overall gene content within the lysogeny module. We conducted phylogenetic analyses on all known Siphoviridae, which showed PH15 and CNPH82 clustering with Staphylococcus aureus, creating a novel clade within the S. aureus group and providing a higher overall resolution of the siphophage branch of the phage proteomic tree than previous studies. Until now, no S. epidermidis phage genome sequences have been reported in the literature, and thus this study represents the first complete genomic and molecular description of two S. epidermidis phages.
TI  - Susceptibility of Streptococcus thermophilus to antibiotics.
AB  - A total of 74 Streptococcus thermophilus isolates collected between 1948 and 2005 from different environments were investigated to assess erythromycin, clindamycin, streptomycin, gentamicin, tetracycline and ampicillin susceptibility by means of microdilution, Etest and disk diffusion methods. For this purpose a new S. thermophilus Susceptibility test Medium (SSM) was developed. This medium allowed a better identification of strains with atypical tetracycline resistance. The recipe is a mixed formulation of Iso-Sensitest medium (90% v/v) and M17 medium (10% v/v) supplemented with lactose (0.5% w/v). The overall agreement of the techniques was good with exception of tetracycline, for which Etest provided lower MICs than the microdilution method. Most strains were susceptible to all the antibiotics tested while a few erythromycin, tetracycline and streptomycin resistant strains were detected.
TI  - Lactobacillus fermentum BR11, a potential new probiotic, alleviates symptoms of colitis induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in rats.
AB  - Current treatments for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are relatively ineffective. Recently, probiotics have emerged as a potential treatment modality for numerous gastrointestinal disorders, including IBD. Few probiotics, however, have undergone appropriate preclinical screening in vivo. The current study compared the effects of four candidate probiotics on development of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in rats. Sprague Dawley rats were gavaged 1 mL of the potential probiotic (1 x 10(10) CFU/mL), or vehicle, twice daily for 14 days. Strains tested were Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), Streptococcus thermophilus TH-4 (TH-4), Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 (Bb12) and Lactobacillus fermentum BR11 (BR11). Colitis was induced from day 7 to 14 via administration of 2% DSS in drinking water. Disease activity index (DAI) was monitored daily until rats were killed at day 14. DAI decreased in DSS+Bb12 and DSS+BR11 compared to DSS+Vehicle. Colon length increased in DSS+BR11 (10%) and DSS+LGG (10%) compared to DSS+Vehicle. DSS+Bb12 and DSS+BR11 prevented the distal colon crypt hyperplasia evident in DSS+Vehicle, DSS+LGG and DSS+TH-4. BR11 was most effective at reducing colitic symptoms. Bb12 had minimal effects, whilst TH-4 did not prevent DSS-colitis and LGG actually exacerbated some indicators of colitis. Further studies into the potential benefits of L. fermentum BR11 are indicated.
TI  - Derepression of excision of integrative and potentially conjugative elements from Streptococcus thermophilus by DNA damage response: implication of a cI-related repressor.
AB  - A DNA-damaging agent, mitomycin C, derepresses the site-specific excision of two  integrative and potentially conjugative elements from Streptococcus thermophilus, ICESt1 and ICESt3. The regulation pathway involves a repressor related to phage lambda cI repressor. It could also involve a putative regulator related to another type of phage repressors, the "cI-like" repressors.
TI  - Identification and differentiation of Lactobacillus, Streptococcus and Bifidobacterium species in fermented milk products with bifidobacteria.
AB  - The aim of this study was to identify and discriminate bacteria contained in commercial fermented milks with bifidobacteria by the use of amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) techniques. ARDRA of the 16S rDNA gene and RAPD were performed on 13 Lactobacillus strains, 13 Streptococcus and 13 Bifidobacterium strains isolated from commercial fermented milk. Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Streptococcus thermophilus and Bifidobacterium animalis isolates were identified by genus- and species-PCR and also, they were differentiated at genus and species level by ARDRA using MwoI restriction enzyme. The ARDRA technique allowed for the discrimination among these three related genus with the use of only one restriction enzyme, since distinctive profiles were obtained for each genus. Therefore it can be a simple, rapid and useful method for routine identification. Also, RAPD technique allowed the discrimination of all bacteria contained in dairy products, at genus- and strain-level by the performance of one PCR reaction.
TI  - The constant gene orf14.9, which belongs to the variable eps (exopolysaccharide)  cluster, is involved in the cell growth of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - In Streptococcus thermophilus, the eps clusters involved in exopolysaccharide (EPS) biosynthesis are very polymorphic, nevertheless they all contain a highly conserved sequence corresponding to that of orf14.9. This open reading frame (ORF) is transcribed in a reverse direction with respect to eps genes. Amino acid sequence analysis showed a possible transmembrane location of the putative Orf14.9 protein but did not permit a proposed function. Insertional mutants of orf14.9 were obtained in strains NST2280 and A054 of S. thermophilus. EPS yields of these mutants are similar to those of their respective wild strains, suggesting that orf14.9 does not modify the quantity of produced EPS. Growth parameter determination for wild strains and their respective mutants showed that orf14.9 is involved in the cell growth of S. thermophilus.
TI  - Treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. A case control experience.
AB  - AIM: As optimal therapy for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) remains elusive, current approach to therapy is based on symptomatic treatment. With this case-control experience we wanted to determine the beneficial effect in IBS patients of a dietary integrator (IBS Active), composed of L-tryptophan, inulin, angelica, vegetal charcoal, vitamin PP, group B vitamins (B1, B2, B6) and probiotics (Lactobacillus sporogenes, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus thermophilus). METHODS: The treatment group comprised 37 patients (11 men and 27 women; mean age, 44.3+/-5.1 years) given IBS Active (440 mg bid) over a mean period of 6 months (range, 5-8). The control group comprised 28 patients (6 men and 22 women; mean age, 48.6+/-3.7 years) who were instructed to continue their customary therapy for 6 months (range, 5-7). All subjects were assessed for the presence of abdominal pain and/or distension, constipation, diarrhea and alternating constipation and diarrhea. RESULTS: Compared with baseline values, the reduction in abdominal pain in the treatment group was 62% (P<0.0001), 55% (P<0.0001) in abdominal distension, 58% (P=0.05) in constipation, 33% (P=0.3) in diarrhea, and 62% (P=0.01) in alternation constipation and diarrhea. Compared with baseline values, no statistically significant reduction in symptoms was found in the control group. Post-treatment comparison between the two groups showed that the study product had reduced symptoms and that the difference was statistically significant for abdominal pain (P<0.000001), abdominal distension (P=0.003) and constipation (P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The use of IBS Active led to a significant improvement in pain symptoms, abdominal distension and regulation of bowel movement in IBS patients. Further study is needed to evaluate the long-term benefit of the study product.
TI  - The smr gene resides on a novel plasmid pSP187 identified in a Staphylococcus pasteuri isolate recovered from unpasteurized milk.
AB  - This work describes a novel plasmid pSP187 (5550 bp) carrying the small multidrug resistance determinant smr encoding resistance to quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs). pSP187 was identified in a Staphylococcus pasteuri isolate recovered from bulk milk in a dairy cattle herd in Norway. Sequence analysis revealed 6 putative ORFs in addition to the smr gene within a cassette with identical genetic organization to that found in the pSK41-like Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pTZ22. A protein homology search suggested the gene product of ORF7 to be a putative replication initiation protein, while ORF2 was predicted to encode a protein homologous to members of FtsK/SpoIIIE cell division-DNA segregation protein families. Sequence similarities to some initiator proteins of rolling circle replicons (RCR) indicated that pSP187 uses a RCR mode of replication, supported by the detection of intermediate ssDNA using S1 nuclease treatment and hybridization analysis. Interestingly, a 30-bp sequence found upstream from ORF7 showed high similarity to other dyad symmetry motifs proposed as putative double-strand origins of replication in the plasmids pGI3 (Bacillus thuringiensis), pSTK1 (Bacillus stearothermophilus), and pER1-2 (Streptococcus thermophilus). IN CONCLUSION: The novel smr-containing plasmid pSP187 is the first member of RCR group VI to be identified in a Staphylococcus sp.
TI  - Rapid screening of plasmid-encoded small hsp-genes in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - A new rapid procedure for detection of small heat shock protein genes (shsp) was  developed. Using PCR-based molecular approach, single colonies of 49 Streptococcus thermophilus industrial and artisanal starters were examined. Five strains contained plasmid-encoded shsp. The nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that the genes are very conservative, as only a few nucleotide substitutions were noticed. It was shown that all new isolated plasmids belong to the pC194 family of rolling circle replicating (RCR) plasmids. We concluded that shsp genes are always inherited together with pC194-type replicative region. The viability of plasmid-bearing and plasmid-free derivatives of S. thermophilus strain ST2980 under heat shock condition was studied.
TI  - Survival of Brucella abortus in milk fermented with a yoghurt starter culture.
AB  - In countries such as Mexico, brucellosis is still an important public health problem due to the consumption of non-pasteurized milk and dairy products, contaminated with Brucella spp. The aim of this study was to look into the survival of Brucella abortus during fermentation of milk with a yoghurt starter culture and storage at refrigeration temperature. Sterile skim milk was inoculated with B. abortus at two concentrations, 10(5) and 10(8) CFU/ml simultaneously with a yoghurt starter culture of lactic acid bacteria (Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subspecie bulgaricus). Inoculated flasks were incubated at 42 degrees C, followed by refrigeration at 4 degrees C. Samples were taken during fermentation and during storage and viable count of B. abortus and lactic acid bacteria and pH were determined. Results showed that after 10 days of storage at 4 degrees C, B. abortus was recovered in fermented milk at a level of 10(5) CFU/ml, despite the low pH below 4.0. Therefore B. abortus is able to survive in fermented milk. This finding may imply that non-pasteurized fermented milk contaminated with Brucella abortus could be a means of transmission of these bacteria.
TI  - Stimulation of immunity without alteration of oral tolerance in mice fed with heat-treated fermented infant formula.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Little information is available on the properties of fermented milk formula intended to healthy infants. This study analyzes the effect of long-term ingestion of a heat-treated, fermented milk formula on the development of oral tolerance or systemic immune response to soluble antigens in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The C3H/HeN mice, fed with a heat-treated fermented (Bifidobacterium breve C50 and Streptococcus thermophilus 065) infant formula (htFF) or a matched control diet (control), were immunized with ovalbumin (OVA) with or without gavage of 20 mg OVA to induce tolerance or immunity, respectively. Systemic and local anti-OVA immune responses and intestinal barrier function were measured after 5 to 6 weeks. RESULTS: Oral tolerance to OVA developed similarly in htFF- and control-fed mice, attested to by the downregulation of OVA-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgE after oral OVA administration. In contrast, immunization with OVA led to significantly higher titers in htFF-fed mice than in control-fed mice (log2 IgG titers, 16.45 +/- 1.24 and 15.46 +/- 0.79, respectively; P = 0.012). Jejunal interferon gamma, interleukin 12p40 and interleukin 10 expressions were significantly higher in tolerized mice fed with htFF compared with those fed with the control diet. Mucosal to serosal intact horseradish peroxidase fluxes were lower in htFF-fed mice than in control-fed mice (39 +/- 8 and 118 +/- 38 ng/h x cm2, respectively; P < 0.0001), indicating that the htFF diet reinforces intestinal barrier capacity to macromolecules. CONCLUSIONS: In mice, htFF strengthens intestinal barrier and enhances systemic immune responses to antigens without interfering with the development of oral tolerance, suggesting a potential beneficial effect in host defence and vaccination.
TI  - Detection and quantification of capsular exopolysaccharides from Streptococcus thermophilus using lectin probes.
AB  - The aim of this work was to use fluorescently labeled lectins to develop a convenient and reliable method to determine the relative abundance of capsular polysaccharides (CPS) at the surface of Streptococcus thermophilus MR-1C cells. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled peanut agglutinin isolated from Arachis hypogaea was found to interact specifically with the CPS of Strep. thermophilus MR-1C. This labeled lectin was then used as an effective probe to detect and quantify CPS. A fluorescence-based lectin-binding assay was successfully applied to follow the accumulation of CPS during the growth of Strep. thermophilus MR-1C in milk and in M17 broth supplemented with lactose. Our results showed that in both media, CPS production by Strep. thermophilus MR-1C began during the exponential phase of growth and continued for several hours after the culture reached the stationary growth phase.
TI  - Natural genetic transformation: A novel tool for efficient genetic engineering of the dairy bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus is widely used for the manufacture of yoghurt and Swiss or Italian-type cheeses. These products have a market value of approximately 40 billion dollars per year, making S. thermophilus a species that has major economic importance. Even though the fermentation properties of this bacterium have been gradually improved by classical methods, there is great potential for further improvement through genetic engineering. Due to the recent publication of three complete genome sequences, it is now possible to use a rational approach for designing S. thermophilus starter strains with improved properties. Progress in this field, however, is hampered by a lack of genetic tools. Therefore, we developed a system, based on natural transformation, which makes genetic manipulations in S. thermophilus easy, rapid, and highly efficient. The efficiency of this novel tool should make it possible to construct food-grade mutants of S. thermophilus, opening up exciting new possibilities that should benefit consumers as well as the dairy industry.
TI  - Altered nucleotide sugar metabolism in Streptococcus thermophilus interferes with nitrogen metabolism.
AB  - Exopolysaccharide (EPS)-producing Streptococcus thermophilus strains have attracted interest recently, since the EPSs act as natural viscosifiers and texture enhancers of fermented foods. We have previously reported that the low level of EPS production by S. thermophilus LY03 could be improved by altering the activities of enzymes in the central carbon metabolism involved in the nucleotide sugar metabolism. In this study, we observed a reduced growth in milk for the strains with increased UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (GalU) activity together with either enhanced phosphoglucomutase activity, and/or enhanced activity of the Leloir enzymes. Rapid growth of these mutants in milk could be restored by the addition of four specific amino acids, i.e. Glu, His, Met, and Val. This amino acid requirement was confirmed in a defined medium. Furthermore, the 31P NMR spectra showed higher levels of the GalU reactants pyrophosphate (PPi) and UDP-glucose in the engineered strain, TMB 6013, compared to the parent strain, LY03. These products plus Glu and the GalU reactant UTP are known to be involved in the nitrogen regulatory system in many bacteria. Thus, these results suggest that the reaction catalyzed by GalU is connected to the nitrogen demand of these engineered strains.
TI  - [Probiotics in chronic inflammatory bowel disease].
AB  - Current data show that probiotics are more effective in preventing the recrudescence of an inflammatory process than in suppressing active disease. This is reflected in the solid evidence for the effect of E. coli Nissle 1917 (Mutaflor) in the maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis, and of VSL#3 in preventing the recurrence of pouchitis. These indications have since been incorporated in valid guidelines. Initial clinical studies have also provided promising results regarding the efficacy of VSL#3 in preventing pouchitis immediately following proctocolectomy.
TI  - Beta-carotene-rich carotenoid-protein preparation and exopolysaccharide production by Rhodotorula rubra GED8 grown with a yogurt starter culture.
AB  - The underlying method for obtaining a beta-carotene-rich carotenoid-protein preparation and exopolysaccharides is the associated cultivation of the carotenoid-synthesizing lactose-negative yeast strain Rhodotorula rubra GED8 with the yogurt starter culture (Lactobacillus bulgaricus 2-11 + Streptococcus thermophilus 15HA) in whey ultrafiltrate (45 g lactose/l) with a maximum carotenoid yield of 13.37 mg/l culture fluid on the 4.5th day. The chemical composition of the carotenoid-protein preparation has been identified. The respective carotenoid and protein content is 497.4 microg/g dry cells and 50.3% per dry weight, respectively. An important characteristic of the carotenoid composition is the high percentage (51.1%) of beta-carotene (a carotenoid pigment with the highest provitamin A activity) as compared to 12.9% and 33.7%, respectively, for the other two individual pigments--torulene and torularhodin. Exopolysaccharides (12.8 g/l) synthesized by the yeast and lactic acid cultures, identified as acid biopolymers containing 7.2% glucuronic acid, were isolated in the cell-free supernatant. Mannose, produced exclusively by the yeast, predominated in the neutral carbohydrate biopolymer component (76%). The mixed cultivation of R. rubra GED8 with the yogurt starter (L. bulgaricus 2-11 + S. thermophilus 15HA) in ultrafiltrate under conditions of intracellular production of maximum amount of carotenoids and exopolysaccharides synthesis enables combined utilization of the culture fluid from the fermentation process.
TI  - Isolation and partial characterization of a biosurfactant produced by Streptococcus thermophilus A.
AB  - Isolation and characterization of the surface active components from the crude biosurfactant produced by Streptococcus thermophilus A was studied. A fraction rich in glycolipids was obtained by the fractionation of crude biosurfactant using hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Molecular (by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) and elemental compositions (by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) were determined. Critical micelle concentration achieved was 20 g/l, allowing for a surface tension value of 36 mJ/m(2). Moreover, this glycolipid rich fraction was found to be an anti-adhesive and antimicrobial agent against several bacterial and yeast strains isolated from explanted voice prostheses. Further purification steps should be carefully analyzed as each purification step will increase the costs and decreases the amounts of biosurfactants recovered.
TI  - Control of EpsE, the phosphoglycosyltransferase initiating exopolysaccharide synthesis in Streptococcus thermophilus, by EpsD tyrosine kinase.
AB  - We studied the roles of Streptococcus thermophilus phosphogalactosyltransferase (EpsE) (the priming enzyme), tyrosine kinase (EpsD), phosphatase (EpsB), and a membrane-associated protein with no known biochemical function (EpsC) in exopolysaccharide (EPS) synthesis. These proteins are well-conserved among bacteria and are usually encoded by clustered genes. Exopolysaccharide synthesis took place in the wild-type strain and a mutant lacking EpsB but not in mutants lacking EpsC, EpsD, or EpsE. The three mutants unable to synthesize EPS lacked the EpsE phosphogalactosyltransferase activity, while the two EPS-synthesizing strains possessed this activity, showing that EpsC and EpsD are required for EpsE function. An EpsD phosphorylated form was found in all strains except the epsC mutant, indicating that EpsC is necessary for EpsD phosphorylation. Moreover, the phosphorylated form of EpsD, a supposedly cytoplasmic protein, was found to be associated with the plasma membrane, possibly due to interaction with EpsC. Finally, the EpsD and EpsE elution profiles in a gel filtration chromatography assay were similar, suggesting that these two proteins colocalize in the membrane. Mutation of Tyr200, predicted to be a phosphorylation site and present in a conserved motif in bacterial phosphoglycosyltransferases, led to EpsE inactivation. In contrast, mutation of Tyr162 or Tyr199 had no effect. Taken together, these data show that EpsD controls EpsE activity. Possible mechanisms for this control are discussed.
TI  - Transcriptional analysis of the recA gene of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: RecA is a highly conserved prokaryotic protein that not only plays several important roles connected to DNA metabolism but also affects the cell response to various stress conditions. While RecA is highly conserved, the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of its structural gene is less conserved. In Escherichia coli the LexA protein acts as a recA repressor and is able, in response to DNA damage, of RecA-promoted self-cleavage, thus allowing recA transcription. The LexA paradigm, although confirmed in a wide number of cases, is not universally valid. In some cases LexA does not control recA transcription while in other RecA-containing bacteria a LexA homologue is not present. RESULTS: We have studied the recA transcriptional regulation in S. thermophilus, a bacterium that does not contain a LexA homologue. We have characterized the promoter region of the gene and observed that its expression is strongly induced by DNA damage. The analysis of deletion mutants and of translational gene fusions showed that a DNA region of 83 base pairs, containing the recA promoter and the transcriptional start site, is sufficient to ensure normal expression of the gene. Unlike LexA of E. coli, the factor controlling recA expression in S. thermophilus acts in a RecA-independent way since recA induction was observed in a strain carrying a recA null mutation. CONCLUSION: In S. thermophilus, as in many other bacteria,recA expression is strongly induced by DNA damage, however, in this organism expression of the gene is controlled by a factor different from those well characterized in other bacteria. A small DNA region extending from 62 base pairs upstream of the recA transcriptional start site to 21 base pairs downstream of it carries all the information needed for normal regulation of the S. thermophilus recA gene.
TI  - Gene gain and gene loss in streptococcus: is it driven by habitat?
AB  - Bacterial genomes can evolve either by gene gain, gene loss, mutating existing genes, and/or by duplication of existing genes. Recent studies have clearly demonstrated that the acquisition of new genes by lateral gene transfer (LGT) is a predominant force in bacterial evolution. To better understand the significance of LGT, we employed a comparative genomics approach to model species-specific and intraspecies gene insertions/deletions (ins/del among 12 sequenced streptococcal genomes using a maximum likelihood method. This study indicates that the rate of gene ins/del is higher on the external branches and varies dramatically for each species. We have analyzed here some of the experimentally characterized species-specific genes that have been acquired by LGT and conclude that at least a portion of these genes have a role in adaptation.
TI  - Diversity of Streptococcus thermophilus phages in a large-production cheese factory in Argentina.
AB  - Phage infections still represent a serious risk to the dairy industry, in which Streptococcus thermophilus is used in starter cultures for the manufacture of yogurt and cheese. The goal of the present study was to analyze the biodiversity of the virulent S. thermophilus phage population in one Argentinean cheese plant. Ten distinct S. thermophilus phages were isolated from cheese whey samples collected in a 2-mo survey. They were then characterized by their morphology, host range, and restriction patterns. These phages were also classified within the 2 main groups of S. thermophilus phages (cos- and pac-type) using a newly adapted multiplex PCR method. Six phages were classified as cos-type phages, whereas the 4 others belonged to the pac-type group. This study illustrates the phage diversity that can be found in one factory that rotates several cultures of S. thermophilus. Limiting the number of starter cultures is likely to reduce phage biodiversity within a fermentation facility.
TI  - Multiplex PCR for the detection and identification of dairy bacteriophages in milk.
AB  - Bacteriophage infections of starter lactic acid bacteria are a serious risk in the dairy industry. Phage infection can lead to slow lactic acid production or even the total failure of fermentation. The associated economic losses can be substantial. Rapid and sensitive methods are therefore required to detect and identify phages at all stages of the manufacture of fermented dairy products. This study describes a simple and rapid multiplex PCR method that, in a single reaction, detects the presence of bacteriophages infecting Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii, plus three genetically distinct 'species' of Lactococcus lactis phages commonly found in dairy plants (P335, 936 and c2). Available bacteriophage genome sequences were examined and the conserved regions used to design five pairs of primers, one for each of the above bacteriophage species. These primers were designed to generate specific fragments of different size depending on the species. Since this method can detect the above phages in untreated milk and can be easily incorporated into dairy industry routines, it might be readily used to earmark contaminated milk for use in processes that do not involve susceptible starter organisms or for use in those that involve phage-deactivating conditions.
TI  - Transformation of isoflavone phytoestrogens during the fermentation of soymilk with lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria.
AB  - In the present study, soymilk is fermented with lactic acid bacteria (Streptococcus thermophilus BCRC 14085, Lactobacillus acidophilus BCRC 14079) and bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium infantis BCRC 14633, B. longum B6) individually, and in combination. The change in the content of various isoflavones (aglycones, glucoside, acetyl- and malonyl-glucosides) and the beta-glucosidase activity in soymilk during fermentation is investigated. It is observed that fermented soymilk contains a lower total isoflavone content (81.94-86.61 microg/ml) than soymilk without fermentation (87.61 microg/ml). Regardless of starter organism employed, fermentation causes a major reduction in the contents of glucoside, malonylglucoside and acetylglucoside isoflavones along with a significant increase of aglycone isoflavones content. The level of change in the content of various isoflavones and beta-glucosidase activity after fermentation varies with the starter organism. Among all the fermented soymilks tested, soymilk fermented with S. thermophilus showed the highest beta-glucosidase activity and the greatest increase in the contents of aglycones. The percentage of daidzein, genistein and glycitein to total isoflavone content in S. thermophilus-fermented soymilk increases from an initial 14.24%, 6.89% and 2.45%, respectively, to 36.20%, 28.80% and 12.44% after 24h of fermentation. Finally, the increase of aglycones and decrease of glucoside isoflavones during fermentation coincides with the increase of beta-glucosidase activity observed in fermented soymilk.
TI  - Antioxidative activities of soymilk fermented with lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria.
AB  - To further the goal of developing a probiotic dietary adjunct using soymilk, soymilk is fermented with lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus acidophilus CCRC 14079 or Streptococcus thermophilus CCRC 14085) and bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium infantis CCRC 14633 or Bifidobacterium longum B6) individually, and in conjunction. We investigate several antioxidative activities including the inhibition of ascorbate autoxidation, the scavenging effect of superoxide anion radicals and hydrogen peroxide, and the reducing activity exerted by different varieties of fermented soymilks. In addition, the effect of spray-drying and freeze-drying on changes in antioxidative activity is examined. We find that in fermented soymilk both the inhibition of ascorbate autoxidation, and the reducing activity and scavenging effect of superoxide anion radicals varied with the starters used, but nevertheless are significantly higher than those found in unfermented soymilk. In general, antioxidative activity in soymilk fermented with lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria simultaneously is significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that fermented with either individually. Moreover, antioxidative activity increases as the fermentation period is extended. However, unfermented soymilk shows an H2O2-scavenging effect, while there is no scavenging effect except for the accumulation of H2O2 in fermented soymilk. Finally, we find that freeze-drying causes a significantly lesser (P < 0.05) reduction in the antioxidative activity of soymilk than does spray-drying. Irrespective of the drying method and the starters used for fermentation. The antioxidative activity of fermented soymilk reduces after drying yet remains higher than that of dried unfermented soymilk.
TI  - Probiotics in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in children: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To systematically evaluate the effectiveness of probiotics in preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) in children. STUDY DESIGN: The following electronic databases up to December 2005, in any language, were searched for studies relevant to AAD and probiotics: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Library. Only randomized controlled trials (RCT) were considered for study inclusion. RESULTS: Six placebo-controlled, RCTs (766 children) were included. Treatment with probiotics compared with placebo reduced the risk of AAD from 28.5% to 11.9% (relative risk, RR, 0.44, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.77, random effect model). Preplanned subgroup analysis showed that reduction of the risk of AAD was associated with the use of Lactobacillus GG (2 RCTs, 307 participants, RR 0.3, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.6), S. boulardii (1 RCT, 246 participants, RR 0.2, 95% CI 0.07-0.6), or B. lactis & Str. thermophilus (1 RCT, 157 participants, RR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3 to 0.95). CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics reduce the risk of AAD in children. For every 7 patients that would develop diarrhea while being treated with antibiotics, one fewer will develop AAD if also receiving probiotics.
TI  - Pheromone-induced expression of recombinant proteins in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - A locus encoding proteins with high homology to the pneumococcal BlpABCHR quorum-sensing system was identified in Streptococcus thermophilus LMG 18311. The BlpABCHR system regulates bacteriocin production in Streptococcus pneumoniae by monitoring the extracellular concentration of a peptide-pheromone encoded by blpC. The homologous system in S. thermophilus, termed StbABCHR, contains a corresponding gene (stbC) encoding a possible peptide-pheromone (STP) that presumably controls bacteriocin production in S. thermophilus. We synthesized this peptide and found that it activates transcription of a gusA reporter gene placed behind the promoter of the bacteriocin-like gene stbD. Furthermore, deletion mapping and mutational analysis of the stbD promoter region were used to identify a degenerated direct repeat motif required for STP induced GusA expression. Our findings provide strong evidence that STP regulates bacteriocin production in S. thermophilus LMG 18311, and show that the StbABCHR quorum-sensing system can be exploited for inducible expression of recombinant proteins in this bacterial species.
TI  - Accuracy of species identity of commercial bacterial cultures intended for probiotic or nutritional use.
AB  - Independent studies have indicated that the microbiological composition of several commercial probiotic products does not correspond to the product label information. The present study set out to investigate to what extent these problems may be due to the use of misidentified cultures at the onset of production. For this purpose, 213 cultures of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and propionibacteria intended for probiotic or nutritional use were collected from 26 manufacturers of probiotic products, three international culture collections and one research institute. The accuracy of the taxonomic identity provided by the strain depositor was assessed through a polyphasic approach based on validated and standardized identification methods including fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (FAFLP) and repetitive DNA element (rep)-PCR fingerprinting, protein profiling and partial 16S rDNA sequencing. The majority of the cultures were received as members of the genera Lactobacillus (57%) and Bifidobacterium (22%); however, propionibacteria, enterococci, Lactococcus lactis (subsp. lactis), Streptococcus thermophilus and pediococci were also obtained. Upon reidentification, 46 cases of misidentification at the genus level (n=19) or species level (n=27) were recorded, including 34 commercial probiotic cultures deposited by 10 different companies. The finding that more than 28% of the commercial cultures intended for human and/or animal probiotic use were misidentified at the genus or species level suggests that many cases of probiotic product mislabeling originate from the incorporation of incorrectly identified strains. A large number of these discrepancies could be related to the use of methods with limited taxonomic resolution (e.g., API strips) or that are unsuitable for reliable identification up to species level (e.g., pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA analysis). The current study has again highlighted that reliable identification of LAB and propionibacteria requires molecular methods with a high taxonomic resolution that are linked to up-to-date identification libraries.
TI  - VSL#3 probiotic mixture: a review of its use in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.
AB  - VSL#3 (VSL#3) is a high-concentration probiotic preparation of eight live freeze-dried bacterial species that are normal components of the human gastrointestinal microflora, including four strains of lactobacilli (Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), three strains of bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium longum, B. breve and B. infantis) and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. Data from noncomparative trials suggest that VSL#3 has clinical potential in the treatment of active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and as maintenance therapy for patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. In addition, a randomised, open-label, multicentre trial showed that VSL#3 in combination with low-dose balsalazide (a prodrug of mesalazine [mesalamine; 5-aminosalicylic acid]) was more effective than standard doses of basalazide or mesalazine monotherapy in the treatment of acute mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown VSL#3 is effective in preventing the onset of acute pouchitis in patients with newly formed surgical pouches, and in maintaining remission following antibacterial treatment of acute pouchitis in patients with a history of refractory or recurrent pouchitis. Treatment guidelines from the US and the UK include VSL#3 as a therapeutic option for the prevention of pouchitis relapse in patients with chronic pouchitis. In general, VSL#3 was well tolerated in clinical trials. Large, well designed, controlled confirmatory clinical trials will further determine the place of VSL#3 in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.
TI  - High genetic variability of the Streptococcus thermophilus cse central part, a repeat rich region required for full cell segregation activity.
AB  - The cse gene of Streptococcus thermophilus encodes an extracytoplasmic protein involved in cell segregation. The Cse protein consists of two putative domains: a cell wall attachment LysM domain and a catalytic CHAP domain. These two domains are spaced by an interdomain linker, known as Var-Cse, previously reported to be highly divergent between two S. thermophilus strains. The aim of this study was to assess the extent of this intraspecific variability and the functional involvement of the var-cse region in cell segregation. Analysis of the var-cse sequence of 19 different strains allowed detection of 11 different alleles, varying from 390 bp to 543 bp, all containing interspersed and tandem nucleotides repeats. Overall, 11 different repeat units were identified and some series of these small repeats, named supermotifs, form large repeats. Results suggested that var-cse evolved by deletion of all or part of the repeats and by duplication of repeats or supermotifs. Moreover, sequence analysis of the whole cse locus revealed that the cse ORF is mosaic suggesting that var-cse polymorphism resulted from horizontal transfer. The partial deletion of the var-cse region of the S. thermophilus strain CNRZ368 led to the lengthening of the number of cells per streptococcal chain, indicating that this region is required for full cell segregation in S. thermophilus strain CNRZ368.
TI  - Yoghurt fermentation at elevated temperatures by strains of Streptococcus thermophilus expressing a small heat-shock protein: application of a two-plasmid system for constructing food-grade strains of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus S4 expressing a small heat-shock protein from the plasmid pSt04-encoded copy of shsp, is able to carry out fermentation at elevated temperature, i.e., at 50 degrees C. In yoghurt culture together with Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, fermentation at elevated temperature results in a mild yoghurt with low post-acidification and improved stability of the starter bacteria during storage at 4 degrees C. To transfer pSt04 into commercial S. thermophilus yoghurt starter strains, a two-plasmid system was constructed. A helper plasmid providing a selectable antibiotic marker, but relying on the repA gene of pSt04, was transformed together with pSt04. After isolation of transformants, the helper plasmid was readily lost upon incubation of transformants in antibiotic-free medium, thus yielding food-grade strains carrying pSt04 only. Successful application of the system was demonstrated.
TI  - Mutagenicity and antimutagenic effect of soymilk fermented with lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria.
AB  - In this study, soymilk was first fermented with lactic acid bacteria (Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus) and bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium longum) both individually and simultaneously. Mutagenicity and the suppression of fermented soymilk against the mutagenesis induced by 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide (4-NQO), a direct-acting mutagen, and 3,2'-dimethyl-4-amino-biphenyl (DMAB), an indirect-acting mutagen, on Salmonella typhimurium TA 100, was then investigated. It was found that the fermented soymilk shows no mutagenic activity on Sal. typhimurium TA 100. Fermentation, in general, significantly (p<0.05) enhanced the antimutagenicity of soymilk. The levels of increased antimutagenicity of fermented soymilk varied with the starter organism and the type of mutagen tested. Although unfermented soymilk exerted lower antimutagenic activity against DMAB than 4-NQO, the fermented soymilk, generally, showed a higher antimutagenic activity against DMAB than 4-NQO. Among the various fermented soymilk tested, soymilk fermented with both Str. themophilus and B. infantis simultaneously exhibited the highest antimutagenicity of 85.07% and 85.78%, respectively, against 4-NQO and DMAB Further investigation on this fermented soymilk revealed that both the antimutagenic factors formed during fermentation and the cells of the starter organisms contributed to the increased antimutagenic activity against DMAB, while the former led to the increased activity against 4-NQO.
TI  - Beta-galactosidase production by Streptococcus thermophilus is higher in the small intestine than in the caecum of human-microbiota-associated mice after lactose supplementation.
AB  - Transit kinetics and survival rates of a bacterial species from yoghurt (i.e. Streptococcus thermophilus strain FBI3) were examined in different digestive compartments of gnotoxenic and human-microbiota-associated mice. The production of the lactose-hydrolysing enzyme (i.e. beta-galactosidase) was also investigated within the digestive tract, using a chromosomal reporter system based on luciferase genes from Photorhabdus luminescens under the control of the plac promoter. In both mice models, S. thermophilus cells transited within 2 h from the stomach to the caecum-colon compartment of the digestive tract where they displayed a survival rate of nearly 100 %. In gnotoxenic mice, luciferase activity was found to increase in the second half of the small intestine and in the caecum-colon compartment when lactose was added to the drinking water provided to the animals. In human-microbiota-associated mice drinking lactose, luciferase activity was similarly increased in the second half of the small intestine but was drastically reduced in the caecum-colon compartment. This feature could be ascribed to the presence of the resident human microbiota.
TI  - Short-chain fatty acid formation in the hindgut of rats fed native and fermented  oat fibre concentrates.
AB  - The formation of SCFA in rats fed fermented oat fibre concentrates was compared with that of rats fed native oat fibre concentrate. The cultures used were lactic acid bacteria consisting of Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus (V2), the exopolysaccharide-producing strain Pediococcus damnosus 2.6 (Pd) and L. reuteri (Lr). The materials were incorporated into test diets yielding a concentration of indigestible carbohydrates of 80 g/kg (dry weight). Rats fed the V2-fermented fibre-concentrate diet yielded higher caecal and distal concentrations of acetic acid (P < 0.01) than rats fed the native fibre concentrate. All the fermented fibre concentrates resulted in a higher propionic acid concentration in the distal colon (P < 0.05), while rats fed Pd-fermented fibre concentrate resulted in lower concentration of butyric acid (P < 0.05, P < 0.01) in all parts of the hindgut as compared with rats fed the native fibre concentrates. Butyrate concentrations ranged between 5-11 micromol/g (distal colon) and 6-8 micromol/g (13 d faeces). Higher proportions of acetic acid (P < 0.05; P < 0.01) were observed in the caecum of rats fed the fermented fibre concentrates. Rats fed Pd- and Lr-fermented fibre concentrates produced higher proportions of propionic acid (P < 0.05; P < 0.01) in the caecum. Changes in SCFA formation in the caecum, distal colon and faeces of rats fed the fermented samples compared with the native sample indicate that these microbes probably survive in the hindgut and that modification of the microflora composition with fermented foods is possible. This may be important for the gastrointestinal flora balance in relation to colonic diseases.
TI  - The rggC locus, with a frameshift mutation, is involved in oxidative stress response by Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - In Streptococcus thermophilus, the locus rggC contains a frameshift mutation and  thus consists of two open reading frames (ORFs), rggC (1) and rggC (2), which encode proteins exhibiting similarity with the Rgg transcriptional regulator family. In this work, mutants showing a partial deletion of rggC (1) and rggC (2 )were constructed and their response to menadione, a superoxide-generating compound, was analysed. These mutants exhibited different behaviour to this oxidative stress compared with the wild-type strain. Analysis of this locus among 21 strains of S. thermophilus showed a polythymine tract length variability and a strain-dependant adenine residue could be found upstream of this repeat. This interstrain polymorphism supports evidence for the hypothesis that the rggC locus is phase variable.
TI  - Assimilation (in vitro) of cholesterol by yogurt bacteria.
AB  - A considerable variation is noticed between the different species studied and even between the strains of the same species, in the assimilation of cholesterol in synthetic media, in presence of different concentrations of bile salts and under anaerobiosis conditions. The obtained results show that certain strains of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus resist bile salts and assimilate appreciable cholesterol quantities in their presence. The study of associations shows that only strains assimilating cholesterol in a pure state remain active when they are put in associations, but there is no additional effect. However, the symbiotic effect between Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus of yogurt, with regard to bile salts, is confirmed. The lactic fermenters of yogurt (Y2) reduce the levels of total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol, in a well-balanced way. In all cases, the assimilated quantity of HDL-cholesterol is lower than that of LDL-cholesterol. Moreover, yogurt Y2 keeps a significant number of bacteria, superior to 10(8) cells ml(-1), and has a good taste 10 days after its production.
TI  - Effect of high-pressure treatment and a bacteriocin-producing lactic culture on the proteolysis, texture, and taste of Hispanico cheese.
AB  - The effects of high-pressure treatment, by itself or in combination with a bacteriocin-producing culture added to milk, on the proteolysis, texture, and taste of Hispanico cheese were investigated. Two vats of cheese were manufactured from a mixture of cow and ewe milk. Milk in one vat was inoculated with 0.5% Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis INIA 415, a nisin Z and lacticin 481 producer; 0.5% L. lactis ssp. lactis INIA 415-2, a bacteriocin-nonproducing mutant; and 2% of a commercial Streptococcus thermophilus culture. Milk in the other vat was inoculated with 1% L. lactis ssp. lactis INIA 415-2 and 2% S. thermophilus culture. After ripening for 15 d at 12 degrees C, half of the cheeses from each vat were treated at 400 MPa for 5 min at 10 degrees C. Ripening of high-pressure-treated and untreated cheeses continued at 12 degrees C until d 50. High-pressure treatment of cheese made from milk without the bacteriocin producer accelerated casein degradation and increased the free AA content, but it did not significantly influence the taste quality or taste intensity of the cheese. Addition of the bacteriocin producer to milk lowered the ratio of hydrophobic peptides to hydrophilic peptides, increased the free AA content, and enhanced the taste intensity. The combination of milk inoculation with the bacteriocin producer and high-pressure treatment of the cheese resulted in higher levels of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic peptides but had no significant effect on the free AA content, taste quality, or taste intensity.
TI  - Immunomodulatory effects of polysaccharides produced by Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus OLL1073R-1.
AB  - The extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) produced by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are associated with the rheology, texture, and mouthfeel of fermented milk products, including yogurt. This study investigated the immunomodulatory effects of EPS purified from the culture supernatant of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (L. bulgaricus) OLL1073R-1. The crude EPS were prepared from the culture supernatant of L. bulgaricus OLL1073R-1 by standard chromatographic methods, and were fractionated into neutral EPS and acidic EPS (APS). Acidic EPS were further fractionated into high molecular weight APS (H-APS) and low molecular weight APS (L-APS). High molecular weight APS were shown to be phosphopolysaccharides containing D-glucose, D-galactose, and phosphorus. Stimulation of mouse splenocytes by H-APS significantly increased interferon-gamma production, and, moreover, orally administered H-APS augmented natural killer cell activity. Oral administration of yogurt fermented with L. bulgaricus OLL1073R-1 and Streptococcus thermophilus OLS3059 to mice showed a similar level of immunomodulation as H-APS. However, these effects were not detected following administration of yogurt fermented with the starter combination of L. bulgaricus OLL1256 and S. thermophilus OLS3295. We conclude from these findings that yogurt fermented with L. bulgaricus OLL1073R-1, containing immunostimulative EPS, would have an immunomodulatory effect on the human body.
TI  - Interactions between EPS-producing Streptococcus thermophilus strains in mixed yoghurt cultures.
AB  - Mixed cultures of different EPS-producing Streptococcus thermophilus strains in combination with a Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strain with negligible EPS-production were used for yoghurt production. The yoghurt texture was characterised with respect to sensory, rheological and microstructural properties and the EPS-concentrations were determined. The cultures resulted in yoghurts with highly different texture properties, and positive interactions between certain Streptococcus thermophilus strains were observed. The underlying properties of yoghurt texture are multidimensional, but a number of microstructural characteristics were apparent in the yoghurts with the highest mouth thickness, creaminess and viscosity. A strong protein network, not too dense and with medium size pores containing EPS, seems associated with these properties. The presence of capsular polysaccharides (CPS) also appeared to be beneficial as did a combination of EPS types, which were distributed differently in the protein network (in serum pores, respectively in association with protein). Obviously, a certain concentration of EPS must be present to provide for these effects on yoghurt texture, but other factors than concentration per se seem more important.
TI  - Survival of yogurt bacteria in the human gut.
AB  - Whether Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus can be recovered after passage through the human gut was tested by feeding 20 healthy volunteers commercial yogurt. Yogurt bacteria were found in human feces, suggesting that they can survive transit in the gastrointestinal tract.
TI  - [Study of vaginal and intestinal microflora of women in the prenatal period and its correction in dysbacteriosis].
AB  - A comparative research of the structure of vaginal and intestinal microflora in norm and at kidney pathologies in women in the prenatal period was carried out. At physiologically normal course of pregnancy microbiocenosis of vagina and intestine does not contain pathogenic and conditional-pathogenic microorganisms. Lactic acid bacteria are fixed within the limits of 10(5)-10(8) CFU/1 ml in the vagina secretion and 10(7)-10(8) CFU/1 g in the intestine content. The spore microorganisms have completely disappeared in vaginal biocenosis of women with pyelonephritis after pharmacotherapy; and colibacterias has disappeared in 62% of women. Quantity of lactic acid bacteria has also decreased. Quantity of E. coli (10(8)- 10(9)) CFU/g, sporous microorganisms (10(3)-10(4)) CFU/g and yeast (10(4)-10(5)) CFU/g has considerably increased in the content of intestine. Lactic acid bacteria in content of the vagina are presented by: Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. plantarum, L. fermentum, L. vaginalis; in content of the intestine--L. plantarum and L. fermentum. All the isolated strains of lactobacilli are resistant to metrogyl and amphotericin, 87%--to cephoxitine, cypropfloxacine. Twenty three of 24 strains of lactic acid bacteria--antagonists of pathogenic microflora have shown adhesion to vaginal epthelium. The degree of adhesive activity depends on the strain and genus specificity of cultures. The highest index of adhesiveness in indicated in Enterococcus faecium (5.82 - 7.62) and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus (2.74 - 6.40) strains. The screening of strains has been performed, which suppress growth of gas-producing microflora. The strain of Lactobacillus plantarum 200D proved to be the most active one. A complex of cultures of the lactic bacteria providing normalization of microbial cenosis of the vagina in women in the prenatal period has been selected as based on the data obtained. The biotechnology of production of vaginal suppositories is developed.
TI  - The complete genome sequence of Lactobacillus bulgaricus reveals extensive and ongoing reductive evolution.
AB  - Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (L. bulgaricus) is a representative of  the group of lactic acid-producing bacteria, mainly known for its worldwide application in yogurt production. The genome sequence of this bacterium has been determined and shows the signs of ongoing specialization, with a substantial number of pseudogenes and incomplete metabolic pathways and relatively few regulatory functions. Several unique features of the L. bulgaricus genome support the hypothesis that the genome is in a phase of rapid evolution. (i) Exceptionally high numbers of rRNA and tRNA genes with regard to genome size may indicate that the L. bulgaricus genome has known a recent phase of important size reduction, in agreement with the observed high frequency of gene inactivation and elimination; (ii) a much higher GC content at codon position 3 than expected on the basis of the overall GC content suggests that the composition of the genome is evolving toward a higher GC content; and (iii) the presence of a 47.5-kbp inverted repeat in the replication termination region, an extremely rare feature in bacterial genomes, may be interpreted as a transient stage in genome evolution. The results indicate the adaptation of L. bulgaricus from a plant-associated habitat to the stable protein and lactose-rich milk environment through the loss of superfluous functions and protocooperation with Streptococcus thermophilus.
TI  - Bioproduction of conjugated linoleic acid by probiotic bacteria occurs in vitro and in vivo in mice.
AB  - Probiotics have been shown to reduce the incidence of colon cancer in animal models. The mechanisms responsible for this activity are poorly defined. Conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) are a group of isomers of linoleic acid (LA) possessing anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic properties, which can be produced from LA by certain bacterial strains. In this study, the ability of probiotic bacteria to exert anticarcinogenic effects through the production of CLA was assessed. Incubation of probiotic bacteria (VSL3, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. casei, L. plantarum, Bifidobacterium breve, B. infantis, B. longum, and Streptococcus thermophilus) in the presence of LA yielded CLA production as measured by gas chromatography. Conditioned medium, containing probiotic-produced CLA, reduced viability and induced apoptosis of HT-29 and Caco-2 cells, as assessed by MTT assay and DNA laddering, respectively. Western blotting demonstrated an increased expression of PPARgamma in cells treated with conditioned medium compared with LA alone. Incubation of murine feces with LA after administering VSL3 yielded 100-fold more CLA than feces collected prior to VSL3 feeding. This study supports a role for supplemental probiotics as a strategy both for attenuating inflammation and for preventing colon cancer.
TI  - Characterisation of lactic acid bacteria isolated from fermented milk "laban".
AB  - The technological properties of 96 lactic acid bacteria isolated from Lebanese traditional fermented milk "laban" were characterised. They were classified by phenotypic and biochemical analyses as Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, thus indicating that laban is a fermented milk similar to yogurt. Most strains of L. bulgaricus (87.5%) exhibited a high acidification activity, whereas strains of streptococci showed low acidification ability. 33.3% of streptococci strains and 25% of lactobacilli strains displayed similar acidification performances as European strains. Results obtained for syneresis, texture and rheological parameters led us to consider that isolated strains were not low polymer-producing strains. Some of them displayed interesting characteristics such as low syneresis and high values for rheological parameters. The major flavour compounds found in pure cultures were acetaldehyde, acetone, 2-butanone, dimethyl disulfide, acetoin, 2,3-butanedione, 2,3-pentanedione, and acetic, hexanoic and butanoic acids. Acetaldehyde (7.4%) and organic acids (48.3%) were mainly produced by L. bulgaricus strains, whereas streptococci cultures contained high relative levels of 2,3-butanedione and acetoin, which represented around 82% of the total flavour compounds. Finally, strains isolated from laban samples exhibited different technological properties than those used in yogurt production, thus conferring specific characteristics to this product.
TI  - Characterization of dominant microbiota of a Ghanaian fermented milk product, nyarmie, by culture- and nonculture-based methods.
AB  - AIMS: To characterize the predominant micro-organisms in a Ghanaian traditional fermented dairy product, nyarmie, made from cows' milk, using both culture- and nonculture-based methods. METHODS AND RESULTS: Samples of nyarmie were analysed from three production sites in Accra, by determining the counts on selective culture media. The microbial diversity occurring in nyarmie was also evaluated by 16S/18S ribosomal DNA PCR amplification and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Results showed that nyarmie contained lactococci and lactobacilli in the range of 10(8) and 10(10) CFU ml(-1), respectively, and yeasts at around 10(7) CFU ml(-1). The pH ranged between 3.49 and 4.25. The predominant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in nyarmie were Leuconostocmesenteroides ssp. mesenteroides, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lact.helveticus, Lact. delbrueckii ssp. lactis and Lactococcus lactis, while Saccharomyces cerevisiae was the predominant yeast species. Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. delbrueckii was not detected by cultivation but its predominance was revealed by PCR-DGGE analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The flora in products from different producers varied in the LAB composition present and may result in variations in product quality. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Development and use of starter cultures for nyarmie may be beneficial in improving the consistency of product quality.
TI  - The ltp gene of temperate Streptococcus thermophilus phage TP-J34 confers superinfection exclusion to Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - The ltp gene, located within the lysogeny module of temperate Streptococcus thermophilus phage TP-J34, has been shown to be expressed in lysogenic strain S. thermophilus J34. It codes for a lipoprotein, as demonstrated by inhibition of cleavage of the signal sequence by globomycin. Exposure of Ltp on the surface of Lactococcus lactis protoplasts bearing a plasmid-encoded copy of ltp has been demonstrated by immunogold labeling and electron microscopy. Expression of ltp in prophage- and plasmid-cured S. thermophilus J34-6f interfered with TP-J34 infection. While plating efficiency was reduced by a factor of about 40 and lysis of strain J34-6f in liquid medium was delayed considerably, phage adsorption was not affected at all. Intracellular accumulation of phage DNA was shown to be inhibited by Ltp. This indicates interference of Ltp with infection at the stage of triggering DNA release and injection into the cell, indicating a role of Ltp in superinfection exclusion. Expression of ltp in L. lactis Bu2-60 showed that the same superinfection exclusion mechanism was strongly effective against phage P008, a member of the lactococcal 936 phage species: no plaque-formation was detectable with even 10(9) phage per ml applied, and lysis in liquid medium did not occur. In Lactococcus also, Ltp apparently inhibited phage DNA release and/or injection. Ltp appears to be a member of a family of small, secreted proteins with a 42 amino acids repeat structure encoded by genes of Gram-positive bacteria. Some of these homologous genes are part of the genomes of prophages.
TI  - Oral ingestion of streptococcus thermophilus diminishes severity of small intestinal mucositis in methotrexate treated rats.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently, there are no available effective preventative or adjunctive agents to alleviate symptoms of chemotherapy-induced mucositis. This is compounded by the absence of a recognized and validated noninvasive biomarker to assess gut function. This study investigated the effects of orally ingested Streptococcus thermophilus (TH-4) on chemotherapy-induced small intestinal damage in rats using the noninvasive (13)C-sucrose breath test (SBT). METHODS: Gastrointestinal damage was induced in 27 female dark agouti rats (148 +/- 1g) with MTX (1.5 mg/kg; i.m.). Rats received MTX or saline at 0 h; with daily treatment of: TH-4 at doses of 10(9) (high), 10(8) (low) cfu/mL, or skim milk (vehicle), 48 h pre and 96 h post-MTX. The noninvasive (13)C-sucrose breath test (SBT) was conducted at -24, 24 and 96 h post-MTX to monitor gut function. At sacrifice, small intestinal tissues were collected for determinations of sucrase activity, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and histological assessment. RESULTS: MTX + vehicle and MTX + low TH-4-treated rats produced significantly lower SBT and sucrase activity results compared to saline controls (p < 0.001). In contrast, MTX + high TH-4 treatment showed no significant differences in the SBT compared to saline controls, and the SBT results were significantly higher compared to MTX + vehicle and MTX + low TH-4 (p < 0.05). MPO levels were significantly elevated (p < 0.05) in MTX + vehicle and MTX + low TH-4, but not following MTX + high TH-4 treatment, compared to saline controls. This was further confirmed by histological analyses. CONCLUSION: Oral ingestion of TH-4 at 10(9) cfu/mL is capable of partially attenuating small bowel damage in rats. The noninvasive SBT is a useful technique to longitudinally assess the efficacy of treatments or interventions for small bowel disease.
TI  - Artisanal and experimental Pecorino Siciliano cheese: microbial dynamics during manufacture assessed by culturing and PCR-DGGE analyses.
AB  - Traditional artisanal Pecorino Siciliano (PS) cheeses, and two experimental PS cheeses were manufactured using either raw or pasteurised ewes' milk with the addition of starter cultures. The bacterial diversity and dynamics of the different cheese types were evaluated both by culturing and characterisation of isolates, and a culture-independent approach based on the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. Following cultivation, artisanal and experimental cheese types showed similar microbial counts, and isolates belonging to Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecalis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides were identified by phenotypic characterisation and comparison of the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of the 16S rRNA gene to that of reference species. The culture-independent fingerprinting technique PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of V6 to V8 regions of the 16S rRNA gene of samples taken during artisanal PS cheese manufacture, from raw milk to the ripened cheese, indicated relevant shifts in the microbial community structure. The dominance of Streptococcus bovis and Lactococcus lactis species in the traditional artisanal PS was revealed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Comparison of DGGE profiles of samples from milk to ripened cheese, derived from artisanal procedure and the two experimental PS cheeses during production showed similar trends with the presence of intense bands in common. Nevertheless, the profiles of several artisanal cheeses from different farms appeared more diverse, and these additional species are probably responsible for the generally superior flavour and aroma development of traditional PS cheese.
TI  - Characterization of Streptococcus thermophilus host range phage mutants.
AB  - To investigate phage-host interactions in Streptococcus thermophilus, a phage-resistant derivative (SMQ-301R) was obtained by challenging a Tn917 library of phage-sensitive strain S. thermophilus SMQ-301 with virulent phage DT1. Mutants of phages DT1 and MD2 capable of infecting SMQ-301 and SMQ-301R were isolated at a frequency of 10(-6). Four host range phage mutants were analyzed further and compared to the two wild-type phages. Altogether, three genes (orf15, orf17, and orf18) contained point mutations leading to amino acid substitutions and were responsible for the expanded host range. These three proteins were also identified in both phages by N-terminal sequencing and/or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The results suggest that at least three phage structural proteins may be involved in phage-host interactions in S. thermophilus.
TI  - Differential proteomic analysis in the study of prokaryotes stress resistance.
AB  - Proteomic technologies are powerful tools to study the physiological response of  bacteria to various environmental stress conditions. Complex protein toolkits coordinated by regulatory networks have evolved to accommodate bacterial survival under several stressing conditions, such as varying temperature or pH, and changes in nutrient availability. This manuscript provides an overview of the major achievements obtained by 2D gel based and non-gel based proteomic approaches for the study of adaptive response in bacteria. As an example, a study carried out on Streptococcus thermophilus response to various stresses is here reported. In this investigation, we used combined proteomic strategies to define proteomic maps useful to highlight protein profile variations following environmental challenges.
TI  - A thermodynamic comparison of HPr proteins from extremophilic organisms.
AB  - A thermodynamic stability study of five histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein (HPr) homologues derived from organisms inhabiting diverse environments is described. These HPr homologues are from Bacillus subtilis (Bs), Streptococcus thermophilus (St), Bacillus staerothermophilus (Bst), Bacillus halodurans (Bh), and Oceanobacillus iheyensis (Oi). Analyses of solvent and thermal denaturation experiments provide the cardinal thermodynamic parameters, like deltaG, deltaH, deltaS, T(m), and deltaC(p), that characterize the conformational stability for each homologue. The homologue from Bacillus staerothermophilus (BstHPr) was established as the most thermostable homologue and also the homologue with highest deltaG at all temperatures. A good correlation between habitat temperature of the organism and thermal stability of the protein is also seen. Stability curves (deltaG vs T) for every homologue are also reported; these reveal very similar deltaC(p) and temperature of maximum stability (T(S)) values for all HPr homologues. Stability curves show that the higher thermal stability of some homologues is not a result of change in curvature of the curve or a shift to higher temperature, but rather a displacement of the stability curves to higher deltaG values. Stability curves also allowed estimation of deltaG at habitat temperature of the organisms, and we find good agreement between homologues. Electrostatic contributions to stability of each homologue were investigated by measuring stability as a function of varying pH and NaCl concentration, and our results suggest that most HPr homologues share similar electrostatic contributions to stability.
TI  - Cultivability of Streptococcus thermophilus in Grana Padano cheese whey starters.
AB  - The application of a culture-independent approach, that of reverse transcriptase-length heterogeneity-PCR coupled with epifluorescence microscopy, allowed us to observe that Streptococcus thermophilus is metabolically active, but only partially cultivable in Grana Padano cheese whey starters. A short preincubation of the starters in sterile skimmed whey was followed by cultivation in sterile skimmed whey-enriched M17. This procedure restored the cultivability of S. thermophilus and enabled us to detect S. thermophilus at ranges (10(7)-10(8) CFU mL(-1)) which have rarely been reported in these cultures. The use of cheese whey as a cultivation-revitalization substrate can be useful to obtain an unbiased picture of the microbial composition of whey starters for Grana Padano cheese, thus avoiding an underestimation of S. thermophilus in these cultures.
TI  - Probiotics and commensals reverse TNF-alpha- and IFN-gamma-induced dysfunction in human intestinal epithelial cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Commensal bacteria are crucial for the development of the mucosal immune system. Probiotics are commensals with special characteristics and may protect mucosal surfaces against pathogens. Pathogens cause significant phenotypic alterations in infected epithelial cells, and probiotics reverse these deleterious responses. We hypothesized that probiotics and/or commensals may also reverse epithelial damage produced by cytokines. METHODS: Human intestinal epithelial cells were exposed basolaterally to interferon (IFN)-gamma (10(3) U/mL) or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (10 ng/mL) for up to 48 hours and assessed for ion transport, transepithelial resistance (TER), and epithelial permeability in the presence or absence of probiotics (Streptococcus thermophilus [ST] and Lactobacillus acidophilus [LA]), or the commensal, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (BT). RESULTS: Agonist-stimulated chloride secretion was inhibited by IFN-gamma, an effect prevented by ST/LA or BT. The ability of ST/LA or BT to restore Cl(-) secretion was blocked by inhibitors of p38 MAPK, ERK1, 2, and PI3K. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and the NKCC1 cotransporter were down-regulated by IFN-gamma, and ST/LA pretreatment reversed this effect. Both TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma significantly reduced TER and increased epithelial permeability, effects prevented by ST/LA or BT. A Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor synergistically potentiated effects of ST/LA or BT on TER and permeability, but p38, ERK1, 2, or PI3K inhibition did not. Finally, only probiotic-treated epithelial cells exposed to cytokines showed reduced activation of SOCS3 and STAT1,3. CONCLUSIONS: Deleterious effects of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma on epithelial function are prevented by probiotic, and to a lesser extent, commensal pretreatment. These data extend the spectrum of effects of such bacteria on intestinal epithelial function and may justify their use in inflammatory disorders.
TI  - [Clinical efficacy of Actimel for patients with the irritated bowel syndrome with prevailing diarrhea].
AB  
TI  - Expression of the heat shock gene clpL of Streptococcus thermophilus is induced by both heat and cold shock.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Heat and cold shock response are normally considered as independent phenomena. A small amount of evidence suggests instead that interactions may exist between them in two Lactococcus strains. RESULTS: We show the occurrence of molecular relationships between the mechanisms of cold and heat adaptations in Streptococcus thermophilus, a lactic acid bacterium widely used in dairy fermentation, where it undergoes both types of stress. We observed that cryotolerance is increased when cells are pre-incubated at high temperature. In addition, the production of a protein, identified as ClpL, a member of the heat-shock ATPase family Clp A/B, is induced at both high and low temperature. A knock-out clpL mutant is deficient in both heat and cold tolerance. However lack of production of this protein does not abolish the positive effect of heat pre-treatment towards cryotolerance. CONCLUSION: Dual induction of ClpL by cold and heat exposure of cells and reduced tolerance to both temperature shocks in a clpL mutant indicates that the two stress responses are correlated in S. thermophilus. However this protein is not responsible by itself for cryotolerance of cells pre-treated at high temperature, indicating that ClpL is necessary for the two phenomena, but does not account by itself for the relationships between them.
TI  - Effect of acacia (Robinia pseudo-acacia L.) honey on the characteristic microflora of yogurt during refrigerated storage.
AB  - The primary purpose of this research was to monitor the influence of acacia honey addition to yogurt milk on survival of the microbial flora of yogurt during refrigerated storage for 6 wk. Results showed that the presence of honey at 1.0% to 5.0% (w/v) did not significantly influence (P>0.05) the viability of characteristic microorganisms (i.e., Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus) in yogurt during storage at 4 degrees C. Similarly, honey had no effect on pH and lactic acid levels of the final products. Despite these findings, enrichment of yogurt with honey is recommended because honey is a natural sweetener that possesses a wide range of beneficial nutritional properties. In addition, at a rate of approximately 3.0% (w/v), it highly improves the sensory quality of the finished product without having a detrimental effect on characteristic lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Food commensal microbes as a potentially important avenue in transmitting antibiotic resistance genes.
AB  - The rapid emergence of antibiotic-resistant (ART) pathogens is a major threat to  public health. While the surfacing of ART food-borne pathogens is alarming, the magnitude of the antibiotic resistance (AR) gene pool in food-borne commensal microbes is yet to be revealed. Incidence of ART commensals in selected retail food products was examined in this study. The presence of 10(2)-10(7) CFU of ART bacteria per gram of foods in many samples, particularly in ready-to-eat, 'healthy' food items, indicates that the ART bacteria are abundant in the food chain. AR-encoding genes were detected in ART isolates, and Streptococcus thermophilus was found to be a major host for AR genes in cheese microbiota. Lactococcus lactis and Leuconostoc sp. isolates were also found carrying AR genes. The data indicate that food could be an important avenue for ART bacterial evolution and dissemination. AR-encoding plasmids from several food-borne commensals were transmitted to Streptococcus mutans via natural gene transformation under laboratory conditions, suggesting the possible transfer of AR genes from food commensals to human residential bacteria via horizontal gene transfer.
TI  - Classification of lactic acid bacteria with UV-resonance Raman spectroscopy.
AB  - UV-resonance Raman spectroscopy is applied as a method for the identification of  lactic acid bacteria from yogurt. Eight different strains of bacteria from Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and Streptococcus thermophilus were investigated. At an excitation wavelength of 244 nm signals from nucleic acids and proteins are selectively enhanced. Classification was accomplished using different chemometric methods. In a first attempt, the unsupervised methods hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis were applied to investigate natural grouping in the data. In a second step the spectra were analyzed using several supervised methods: K-nearest neighbor classifier, nearest mean classifier, linear discriminant analysis, and support vector machines.
TI  - Inhibition of microbial adhesion to silicone rubber treated with biosurfactant from Streptococcus thermophilus A.
AB  - Microbial adhesion of four bacterial and two yeast strains isolated from explanted voice prostheses to silicone rubber before and after conditioning with a biosurfactant obtained from the probiotic bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus A was investigated in a parallel plate flow chamber. The silicone rubber with and without an adsorbed biosurfactant layer was characterized using contact angle measurements. Water contact angles indicated that the silicone rubber surface with adsorbed biosurfactant was more hydrophilic (58 degrees) than bare silicone rubber (109 degrees). The results obtained showed that the biosurfactant was effective in decreasing the initial deposition rates, and the number of bacterial cells adhering after 4 h, for all microorganisms tested. A decrease in the initial deposition rate was observed for Rothia dentocariosa GBJ 52/2B and Staphylococcus aureus GB 2/1 from 1937+/-194 to 179+/-21 microorganisms cm(-2) s(-1) and from 1255+/-54 to 233+/-26 microorganisms cm(-2) s(-1), respectively, accounting for an 86% reduction of the initial deposition rate for both strains. The number of bacterial cells adhering to the silicone rubber with preadsorbed biosurfactant after 4 h was further reduced by 89% and 97% by the two strains, respectively. The two yeast strains tested showed less reduction in adhesion after 4 h, to values between 67% and 70%. Such a pretreatment with surface-active compounds may constitute a promising strategy to reduce the microbial colonization rate of silicone rubber voice prostheses.
TI  - Proteome analysis of Streptococcus thermophilus grown in milk reveals pyruvate formate-lyase as the major upregulated protein.
AB  - We investigated the adaptation to milk of Streptococcus thermophilus LMG18311 using a proteomic approach. Two-dimensional electrophoresis of cytosolic proteins were performed after growth in M17 medium or in milk. A major modification of the proteome concerned proteins involved in the supply of amino acids, like the peptidase PepX, and several enzymes involved in amino acid biosynthesis. In parallel, we observed the upregulation of the synthesis of seven enzymes directly involved in the synthesis of purines, as well as formyl-tetrahydrofolate (THF) synthetase and serine hydroxy-methyl transferase, two enzymes responsible for the synthesis of compounds (THF and glycine, respectively) feeding the purine biosynthetic pathway. The analysis also revealed a massive increase in the synthesis of pyruvate formate-lyase (PFL), the enzyme which converts pyruvate into acetyl coenzyme A and formate. PFL has been essentially studied for its role in mixed-acid product formation in lactic acid bacteria during anaerobic fermentation. However, formate is an important methyl group donor for anabolic pathway through the formation of folate derivates. We hypothesized that PFL was involved in purine biosynthesis during growth in milk. We showed that PFL expression was regulated at the transcriptional level and that pfl transcription occurred during the exponential growth phase in milk. The complementation of milk with formate or purine bases was shown to reduce pfl expression, to suppress PFL synthesis, and to stimulate growth of S. thermophilus. These results show a novel regulatory mechanism controlling the synthesis of PFL and suggest an unrecognized physiological role for PFL as a formate supplier for anabolic purposes.
TI  - The activity of the lactose transporter from Streptococcus thermophilus is increased by phosphorylated IIA and the action of beta-galactosidase.
AB  - The metabolism of lactose by Streptococcus thermophilus is highly regulated, allowing the bacterium to prefer lactose over glucose as main source of carbon and energy. In vitro analysis of the enzymes involved in transport and hydrolysis of lactose showed that the transport reaction benefits from the hydrolysis of lactose at the trans side of the membrane. Furthermore, the activity of LacS is modulated by PEP-dependent phosphorylation of the IIA domain via the general energy coupling proteins of the PTS, Enzyme I and HPr. To determine whether unphosphorylated LacS-IIA inhibited, or the phosphorylated form stimulated lactose counterflow, a LacS-IIA truncation mutant of LacS was constructed. Detailed analyses of transport in whole cells and in proteoliposomes indicated that unphosphorylated LacS-IIA does not functionally interact with the carrier domain. Instead, interaction of the phosphorylated form of LacS-IIA with the carrier stimulates lactose counterflow transport. The proposed mode of regulation thus proceeds via a mechanism opposite to the inducer exclusion type of regulation in gram-negative bacteria, where transporters are inhibited by binding of the unphosphorylated form of IIA(Glc).
TI  - Probiotics down-regulate flaA sigma28 promoter in Campylobacter jejuni.
AB  - Lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are important members of the gastrointestinal microflora of humans and animals and are thought to have positive effects on human health. Therefore, there is an increasing interest in using these microorganisms as probiotics to be incorporated into either fermented dairy products or tablets. However, convincing scientific data that support claims of their health benefits are scarce. The effect of cell-free extracts of milk fermented by 10 probiotic bacteria (five Bifidobacterium strains and five Lactobacillus strains) on the expression of the flaA gene of Campylobacter jejuni was assessed using a fusion between the flaA sigma28 promoter and a promoterless luxCDABE cassette carried on the plasmid pRYluxCDABE, which resulted in strains with quantifiable luminescence linked to flaA sigma28 promoter activity. Cell-free extracts of milk fermented by all of the tested probiotic strains inhibited the growth of the C. jejuni and down-regulatedflaA sigma28 promoter activity. Two nonprobiotic lactic acid bacterial strains, Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus, were less inhibitory.
TI  - Amino acid profiles of lactic acid bacteria, isolated from kefir grains and kefir starter made from them.
AB  - The characteristics of cell growth, lactic acid production, amino acid release and consumption by single-strain cultures of lactic acid bacteria (isolated from kefir grains), and by a multiple-strain kefir starter prepared from them, were studied. The change in the levels of free amino acids was followed throughout the kefir process: single-strain kefir bacteria and the kefir starter (Lactococcus lactis C15-1%+Lactobacillus helveticus MP12-3%+(Streptococcus thermophilus T15+Lactobacillus bulgaricus HP1 = 1:1)-3%) were cultivated in pasteurized (92 degrees C for 20 min) cow's milk (3% fat content) at 28 degrees C for 5 h (the kefir starter reached pH 4.7) and subsequently grown at 20 degrees C for 16 h; storage was at 4 degrees C for 168 h. The strain L. helveticus MP12 was unrivaled with respect to free amino acid production (53.38 mg (100 g)(-1)) and cell growth (17.8 x 10(8) CFU ml(-1)); however, it manifested the lowest acidification activity. L. bulgaricus HP1 released approximately 3.7 times less amino acids, nearly 5 times lower cell growth, and produced about 1.2 times more lactic acid. S. thermophilus T15 demonstrated dramatically complex amino acid necessities for growth and metabolism. With L. lactis C15, the highest levels of growth and lactic acid synthesis were recorded (18.3 x 10(8) CFU ml(-1) and 7.8 g l(-1) lactic acid at the 21st hour), and as for free amino acid production, it approximated L. bulgaricus HP1 (17.03 mg (100 g)(-1) maximum concentration). In the L. lactis C15 culture, the amino acids were used more actively throughout the first exponential growth phase (by the 10th hour) than during the second growth phase. The unique properties of the L. helveticus MP12 strain to produce amino acids were employed to create a symbiotic bioconsortium kefir culture, which, under conditions of kefir formation, enhanced lactic acid production and shortened the time required to reach pH 4.7; intensified cell growth activity, resulting in a respective 90- and 60-fold increase in the concentration of lactobacilli and cocci in the mixed culture compared to individual cultures; and accumulated free amino acids in the final kefir with higher total concentrations (56.88 mg (100 g)(-1)) and an individual concentration of essential amino acids (1.5 times) greater than that of yogurt.
TI  - Effects of exopolysaccharide-producing cultures on the viscoelastic properties of reduced-fat Cheddar cheese.
AB  - The objective was to study the influence of different exopolysaccharide (EPS)-producing and nonproducing lactic cultures on the viscoelastic properties of reduced-fat Cheddar cheese. Changes in the viscoelastic properties were followed over a ripening period of 6 mo. Results showed that the elastic, viscous, and complex moduli were higher in reduced-fat cheeses made with EPS-nonproducing cultures than in full-fat cheese. No differences in the viscoelastic properties were found between young reduced-fat cheese made with a ropy strain of Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris (JFR1) and its full-fat counterpart. Interestingly, the changes in viscoelastic moduli in both full-fat cheese and reduced-fat cheese made with JFR1 during ripening followed the same pattern. Whereas the moduli increased during the first month of ripening in those 2 cheeses, a dramatic decrease was observed in all other cheeses. Slopes of the viscoelastic moduli as a function of frequency were lower in the full-fat than in reduced-fat cheeses. The creep test showed that fresh reduced-fat cheese made with JFR1 was less rigid and more deformable than that made with EPS-nonproducing cultures. The creep and recovery properties of young reduced-fat cheese made with JFR1 and the full-fat type were similar. No differences were found in the viscoelastic properties between reduced-fat cheese made with no EPS and those made with EPS-producing adjunct cultures of Streptococcus thermophilus. After 6 mo of ripening, cheeses made with EPS-producing cultures maintained lower elastic and viscous moduli than did those made with no EPS.
TI  - Application of exopolysaccharide-producing cultures in reduced-fat Cheddar cheese: composition and proteolysis.
AB  - Proteolysis during ripening of reduced fat Cheddar cheeses made with different exopolysaccharide (EPS)-producing and nonproducing cultures was studied. A ropy strain of Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris (JFR1) and capsule-forming nonropy and moderately ropy strains of Streptococcus thermophilus were used in making reduced-fat Cheddar cheese. Commercial Cheddar starter was used in making full-fat cheese. Results showed that the actual yield of cheese made with JFR1 was higher than that of all other reduced-fat cheeses. Cheese made with JFR1 contained higher moisture, moisture in the nonfat substance, and residual coagulant activity than all other reduced-fat cheeses. Proteolysis, as determined by PAGE and the level of water-soluble nitrogen, was also higher in cheese made with JFR1 than in all other cheeses. The HPLC analysis showed a significant increase in hydrophobic peptides (causing bitterness) during storage of cheese made with JFR1. Cheese made with the capsule-forming nonropy adjunct of S. thermophilus, which contained lower moisture and moisture in the nonfat substance levels and lower chymosin activity than did cheese made with JFR1, accumulated less hydrophobic peptides. In conclusion, some EPS-producing cultures produced reduced-fat Cheddar cheese with moisture in the nonfat substance similar to that in its full-fat counterpart without the need for modifying the standard cheese-making protocol. Such cultures might accumulate hydrophobic (bitter) peptides if they do not contain the system able to hydrolyze them. For making high quality reduced-fat Cheddar cheese, EPS-producing cultures should be used in conjunction with debittering strains.
TI  - A study of Streptococcus thermophilus proteome by integrated analytical procedures and differential expression investigations.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus is a Gram-positive bacterium belonging to the group of lactic acid bacteria, among which several genera play an essential role in manufacture of food products. Recently, a genomic consortium sequenced and annotated its entire genome, which has been demonstrated to contain 1900 coding sequences. In this study, we have revealed the expression products of almost 200 different genes using a proteomic strategy combining 2-DE plus MALDI-TOF PMF and differential 1-DE plus muLC-ESI-IT-MS/MS. Thus, a number of cellular pathways related to important physiological processes were described at the proteomic level. Almost 50 genes were related to multiple electrophoretic species, whose heterogeneity was mainly due to variability in pI values. A 2-DE reference map obtained for lactose-grown cells was compared with those obtained after heat, cold, acid, oxidative and starvation stresses. Protein up/down-regulation measurements demonstrated that adaptation to different environmental challenges may involve the contribution of unique as well as combined physiological mechanisms. Common regulatory sites in the promoter region of genes whose expression was induced after stress were identified. These results provide a better comprehension of biochemical processes related to stress resistance in S. thermophilus, allowing defining the molecular bases of adaptative responses or markers for the identification of strains with potential industrial applications.
TI  - Conjugated linoleic acid content and organoleptic attributes of fermented milk products produced with probiotic bacteria.
AB  - The effect of probiotic bacteria on the formation of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), microbial growth, and organoleptic attributes (acidity, texture, and flavor) of fermented milk products was determined. Four probiotic bacteria, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii 56, P. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii 51, and P. freudenreichii subsp. freudenreichii 23, were evaluated individually or in coculture with traditional yogurt cultures (Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus). The lipid source was hydrolyzed soy oil. L. rhamnosus, in coculture with yogurt culture, resulted in the highest content of CLA. Growth and CLA formation of propionibacteria were enhanced in the presence of yogurt cultures. Texture and flavor attributes of fermented milks produced with propionibacteria were significantly different than the fermented milks processed with yogurt cultures. The fermented milks processed with probiotic bacteria in coculture with yogurt cultures demonstrated similar acidity, texture, and flavor as the fermented milk produced with yogurt cultures.
TI  - Bifidobacterium breve and Streptococcus thermophilus secretion products enhance T helper 1 immune response and intestinal barrier in mice.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria or their secretion products can modulate immune responses differently in normal and inflammatory conditions. This comparative study analyzes the effect of oral administration of living lactic acid bacteria, or their conditioned media, on the epithelial and immune functions of colitis-prone C57BL/6 IL-10-deficient mice. Mice were untreated (control) or infected with Helicobacter hepaticus with or without oral treatment with living bacteria, Bifidobacterium breve C50 and Streptococcus thermophilus 065 (LB), or their culture-conditioned media (CM). Histology, cytokine mRNA, electrical resistance, and barrier capacity of colonic samples as well as cytokine secretion by mesenteric lymph node (MLN) cells were studied. Helicobacter hepaticus mice developed only mild colitis, which was not modified in LB or CM groups. In the CM (but not the LB) group, the colonic barrier was reinforced as compared to the other groups, as evidenced by decreased horseradish peroxidase (HRP) transcytosis and mannitol fluxes and increased electrical resistance. In MLN, the percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells secreting IFNgamma was significantly higher in CM (2.06% and 1.98%, respectively) mice than in H. hepaticus (1.1% and 0.47%, P < 0.05) or control mice. In addition, the nonspecific stimulation of IFNgamma, TNFalpha, and IL-12 secretion by MLN cells was significantly higher in the CM group as compared to the other groups. In the absence of severe colitis, Bifidobacterium breve C50- and Streptococcus thermophilus 065-conditioned media can reinforce intestinal barrier capacity and stimulate Th1 immune response, highlighting the involvement of lactic acid bacteria-derived components in host defense.
TI  - Effects of specific lactic acid bacteria on the intestinal permeability to macromolecules and the inflammatory condition.
AB  - Non-live probiotic bacteria and their fermentation products can be used in milk-based formula intended for healthy infants. The effects of a milk formula fermented with Bifidobacterium breve and Streptococcus thermophilus and heated/dehydrated to inactivate the micro-organisms have been reported over the last few years to decrease the intestinal permeability to macromolecules in experimental animals in vivo and more recently to down-regulate inflammatory condition in vitro. Feeding guinea-pigs with such dehydrated fermented milk reinforced the intestinal barrier resistance to food proteins (HRP, beta-lactoglobulin). In addition, the products secreted by bacteria were capable of inhibiting the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced TNF-alpha secretion by human peripheral mononuclear blood cells. The active secretion products were resistant to digestive enzymes and their anti-inflammatory properties were preserved after transepithelial transport across the filter-grown intestinal epithelial cell line, especially in inflammatory conditions. The binding of LPS to monocytes as well as NFkappaB nuclear translocation leading to pro-inflammatory cytokine transcription were inhibited by bacteria-culture supernatants. CONCLUSION: B. breve and S. thermophilus used as non-live micro-organisms in fermented infant formula seem to induce a reduction in macromolecular absorption and release metabolites exerting an anti-TNF-alpha effect, which persists after intestinal transport. Thus, specific lactic acid bacteria and their metabolites seem to affect positively the intestinal function.
TI  - Effects of yeasts and bacteria on the levels of folates in rye sourdoughs.
AB  - Fermentation of rye dough is often accompanied with an increase in folate content. In this study, three sourdough yeasts, Candida milleri CBS 8195, Saccharomyces cerevisiae TS 146, and Torulaspora delbrueckii TS 207; a control, baker's yeast S. cerevisiae ALKO 743; and four Lactobacillus spp., L. acidophilus TSB 262, L. brevis TSB 307, L. plantarum TSB 304, and L. sanfranciscensis TSB 299 originally isolated from rye sourdough were examined for their abilities to produce or consume folates. The microorganisms were grown in yeast extract-peptone-d-glucose medium as well as in small-scale fermentations that modelled the sourdough fermentation step used in rye baking. Total folate contents were determined using Lactobacillus rhamnosus (ATCC 7469) as the growth indicator organism. The microorganisms studied did not excrete folates into the media in significant amounts. Yeasts increased the folate contents of sterilised rye flour-water mixtures from 6.5 microg/100 g to between 15 and 23 microg/100 g after 19-h fermentation, whereas lactic acid bacteria decreased it to between 2.9 and 4.2 microg/100 g. Strains of Lactobacillus bulgaricus, L. casei, L. curvatus, L. fermentum, L. helveticus, Pediococcus spp., and Streptococcus thermophilus that were also tested gave folate contents after fermentation that varied between 2 and 10.4 microg/100 g. Although the four Lactobacillus spp. from sourdough consumed folates their effect on folate contents in co-cultivations was minimal. It was concluded that the increase of folate content during fermentation was mainly due to folate synthesis by yeasts. Fermentation of non-sterilised flour-water mixtures as such resulted in three-fold increases in the folate contents. Two folate producing bacteria were isolated from the non-sterilised flour and identified as Enterobacter cowanii and Pantoea agglomerans.
TI  - [Elucidation of the taxonomic status of industrial strains of thermophilic lactic acid bacteria by sequencing of 16S rRNA genes].
AB  - Phenotypic characteristics and results of PCR tests for the presence of species-specific genes indicate that a number of strains of thermophilic lactic acid bacteria previously considered as belonging to Streptococcus thermophilus are actually closely related to enterococci. In the present study, partial (over 500 nucleotides) sequencing of 16S rRNA genes from 12 strains of thermophilic lactic acid bacteria used as starters for manufacturing sour milk products on the territory of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) has been performed. According to the results of the sequencing, seven of the strains have been classified with Enterococcus durans. The earlier classification (based on PCR tests) of two of the strains as S. thermophilus and three of the strains as E. faecium has been confirmed. The data obtained demonstrate that the enterococci E. durans and E. faecium are widely used as thermophilic starters for manufacturing sour milk products on the territory of the CIS.
TI  - Metabolically improved exopolysaccharide production by Streptococcus thermophilus and its influence on the rheological properties of fermented milk.
AB  - Altered levels of enzymes in the central carbon metabolism in Streptococcus thermophilus increased the exopolysaccharide (EPS) production 3.3 times over that of the parent strain. The influence of enhanced EPS production on the rheological properties of fermented milk is described for engineered strains of S. thermophilus which produce different levels of EPSs.
TI  - Detection and characterization of Streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophages by use of the antireceptor gene sequence.
AB  - In the dairy industry, the characterization of Streptococcus thermophilus phage types is very important for the selection and use of efficient starter cultures. The aim of this study was to develop a characterization system useful in phage control programs in dairy plants. A comparative study of phages of different origins was initially performed based on their morphology, DNA restriction profiles, DNA homology, structural proteins, packaging mechanisms, and lifestyles and on the presence of a highly conserved DNA fragment of the replication module. However, these traditional criteria were of limited industrial value, mainly because there appeared to be no correlation between these variables and host ranges. We therefore developed a PCR method to amplify VR2, a variable region of the antireceptor gene, which allowed rapid detection of S. thermophilus phages and classification of these phages. This method has a significant advantage over other grouping criteria since our results suggest that there is a correlation between typing profiles and host ranges. This association could be valuable for the dairy industry by allowing a rational starter rotation system to be established and by helping in the selection of more suitable starter culture resistance mechanisms. The method described here is also a useful tool for phage detection, since specific PCR amplification was possible when phage-contaminated milk was used as a template (detection limit, 10(5) PFU ml(-1)).
TI  - Evaluation of a diet containing probiotics and zinc for the treatment of mild diarrheal illness in children younger than one year of age.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Supplementation of probiotics and supplementation of zinc during acute gastroenteritis in children have been shown to exert positive effects on diarrhea duration and severity. Our aim was to evaluate a new diet enriched with zinc and probiotic bacteria in the treatment of acute gastroenteritis in young children. METHODS: In a double blind prospective study, 65 children aged 6-12 months were randomized to receive 6 x 10(9) colony forming units of Streptococcus thermophilus, Bifidobacterium lactis, Lactobacillus acidophilus (2 x 10(9) of each strain), 10 mg of zinc/day, and 0.3 grams of fructo-oligosaccharides in the supplemented group (n = 33) or placebo (n = 32), given in a soy protein based rice cereal. For each child, age, sex, weight, degree of dehydration, the presence of fever or vomiting, stool frequency and consistency were recorded daily until diarrhea resolution. RESULTS: Diarrhea resolution occurred after 1.43 +/- 0.71 days in the supplemented group vs. 1.96 +/- 1.24 in the control group (p = 0.017). In the subset of children who presented with vomiting, time to vomiting resolution was 0.27 +/- 0.59 vs. 0.81 +/- 0.91 days in the supplemented and control groups, respectively (p = 0.06). On day 3, there was only 1 child with watery stools in the supplemented group versus 10 children in the control group (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: In our series, the feeding of a cereal containing Streptococcus thermophilus, Bifidobacterium lactis, Lactobacillus acidophilus and zinc, reduced the severity and duration of acute gastroenteritis in young children. However, whether this combination is better than either the addition of probiotics or zinc alone is yet to be determined.
TI  - Oral probiotics prevent necrotizing enterocolitis in very low birth weight neonates.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that normalizing the intestinal flora by administration of prophylactic probiotics would provide a natural defense, thereby reducing both the incidence and severity of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in preterm neonates. STUDY DESIGN: Neonates < or =1500 g birth weight were randomized to either receive a daily feeding supplementation with a probiotic mixture (Bifidobacteria infantis, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Bifidobacteria bifidus; Solgar, Israel) of 10(9) colony forming units (CFU)/day or to not receive feed supplements. NEC was graded according to Bell's criteria. RESULTS: For 72 study and 73 control infants, respectively, birth weight (1152 +/- 262 g vs 1111 +/- 278 g), gestational age (30 +/- 3 weeks vs 29 +/- 4 weeks), and time to reach full feeds (14.6 +/- 8.7 days vs 17.5 +/- 13.6 days) were not different. The incidence of NEC was reduced in the study group (4% vs 16.4%; P=.03). NEC was less severe in the probiotic-supplemented infants (Bell's criteria 2.3 +/- 0.5 vs 1.3 +/- 0.5; P=.005). Three of 15 babies who developed NEC died, and all NEC-related deaths occurred in control infants. CONCLUSION: Probiotic supplementation reduced both the incidence and severity of NEC in our premature neonatal population.
TI  - New insights in the molecular biology and physiology of Streptococcus thermophilus revealed by comparative genomics.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus is a major dairy starter used for the manufacture of yoghurt and cheese. The access to three genome sequences, comparative genomics and multilocus sequencing analyses suggests that this species recently emerged and is still undergoing a process of regressive evolution towards a specialised bacterium for growth in milk. Notably, S. thermophilus has maintained a well-developed nitrogen metabolism whereas its sugar catabolism has been subjected to a high level of degeneracy due to a paucity of carbon sources in milk. Furthermore, while pathogenic streptococci are recognised for a high capacity to expose proteins at their cell surface in order to achieve cell adhesion or to escape the host immune system, S. thermophilus has nearly lost this unique feature as well as many virulence-related functions. Although gene decay is obvious in S. thermophilus genome evolution, numerous small genomic islands, which were probably acquired by horizontal gene transfer, comprise important industrial phenotypic traits such as polysaccharide biosynthesis, bacteriocin production, restriction-modification systems or oxygen tolerance.
TI  - Use of a probiotic to decrease enteric hyperoxaluria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease have a 10- to 100-fold increased risk of nephrolithiasis, with enteric hyperoxaluria being the major risk factor for these and other patients with fat malabsorptive states. Endogenous components of the intestinal microflora can potentially limit dietary oxalate absorption. METHODS: Ten patients were studied with chronic fat malabsorption, calcium oxalate stones, and hyperoxaluria thought to be caused by jejunoileal bypass (1) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery for obesity (4), dumping syndrome secondary to gastrectomy (2), celiac sprue (1), chronic pancreatitis (1), and ulcerative colitis in remission (1). For 3 months, patients received increasing doses of a lactic acid bacteria mixture (Oxadrop), VSL Pharmaceuticals), followed by a washout month. Twenty-four-hour urine collections were performed at baseline and after each month. RESULTS: Mean urinary oxalate excretion fell by 19% after 1 month (1 dose per day, P < 0.05), and oxalate excretion remained reduced by 24% during the second month (2 doses per day, P < 0.05). During the third month on 3 doses per day oxalate excretion increased slightly, so that the mean was close to the baseline established off treatment. Urinary oxalate again fell 20% from baseline during the washout period. Calcium oxalate supersaturation was reduced while on Oxadrop, largely due to the decrease in oxalate excretion, although mean changes did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: Manipulation of gastrointestinal (GI) flora can influence urinary oxalate excretion to reduce urinary supersaturation levels. These changes could have a salutary effect on stone formation rates. Further studies will be needed to establish the optimal dosing regimen.
TI  - Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus survive gastrointestinal transit of healthy volunteers consuming yogurt.
AB  - To date, there is significant controversy as to the survival of yogurt bacteria (namely, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus) after passage through the human gastrointestinal tract. Survival of both bacterial species in human feces was investigated by culture on selective media. Out of 39 samples recovered from 13 healthy subjects over a 12-day period of fresh yogurt intake, 32 and 37 samples contained viable S. thermophilus (median value of 6.3 x 10(4) CFU g(-1) of feces) and L. delbrueckii (median value of 7.2 x 10(4)CFU g(-1) of feces), respectively. The results of the present study indicate that substantial numbers of yogurt bacteria can survive human gastrointestinal transit.
TI  - Proteolytic activity of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus in frozen-stored Kashkaval cheese.
AB  - Proteolytic activity of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus in Kashkaval cheeses of varying aging times, stored at -10 to -12 degrees C for 12 months, was studied. It was established that the proteolysis of Kashkaval cheese induced by the starter culture was significantly delayed by freezing. The noncasein nitrogen (NCN/TN) and nonprotein nitrogen (NPN/TN) as a percentage of total nitrogen increased slightly during frozen storage of Kashkaval. It was found that NCN/TN and NPN/TN values increased to a larger extent in frozen-stored Kashkaval samples with shorter aging time. Enhanced proteolysis was observed during ripening of thawed Kashkaval cheese. There was greater accumulation of noncasein nitrogen in thawed Kashkaval samples compared to the control samples. The enhanced proteolysis during ripening of thawed Kashkaval cheese resulted in larger amounts of high and medium molecular weight peptides and lower amounts of low molecular weight peptides and free amino acids as compared to controls.
TI  - Clustered regularly interspaced short palindrome repeats (CRISPRs) have spacers of extrachromosomal origin.
AB  - Numerous prokaryote genomes contain structures known as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs), composed of 25-50 bp repeats separated by unique sequence spacers of similar length. CRISPR structures are found in the vicinity of four genes named cas1 to cas4. In silico analysis revealed another cluster of three genes associated with CRISPR structures in many bacterial species, named here as cas1B, cas5 and cas6, and also revealed a certain number of spacers that have homology with extant genes, most frequently derived from phages, but also derived from other extrachromosomal elements. Sequence analysis of CRISPR structures from 24 strains of Streptococcus thermophilus and Streptococcus vestibularis confirmed the homology of spacers with extrachromosomal elements. Phage sensitivity of S. thermophilus strains appears to be correlated with the number of spacers in the CRISPR locus the strain carries. The authors suggest that the spacer elements are the traces of past invasions by extrachromosomal elements, and hypothesize that they provide the cell immunity against phage infection, and more generally foreign DNA expression, by coding an anti-sense RNA. The presence of gene fragments in CRISPR structures and the nuclease motifs in cas genes of both cluster types suggests that CRISPR formation involves a DNA degradation step.
TI  - Thermophilin 110: a bacteriocin of Streptococcus thermophilus ST110.
AB  - A screen of thermophilic lactic acid bacteria identified Streptococcus thermophilus strain ST110 as the putative producer of a bacteriocin with high level of activity against pediococci. Thermophilin 110 was isolated from culture supernatant after 16 h of growth and partially purified by a chloroform extraction procedure. The bacteriocin inhibited the growth of several lactic acid bacteria and in the case of Pediococcus acidilactici, it induced cell lysis with the concomitant release of OD260-absorbing material and intracellular enzymes. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed two components with estimated sizes between 4.0 kDa and 4.5 kDa, respectively, with possible involvement in bacteriocin activity as indicated by agar overlay assays with P. acidilactici as the target organism. Thermophilin 110 was inactivated by several proteolytic enzymes and also by alpha-amylase, which indicated the putative requirement of a glycosidic component for activity. The bacteriocin produced by S. thermophilus may be especially useful in the food processing industries to control spoilage caused by pediococci.
TI  - Global gene expression analysis of two Streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophages  using DNA microarray.
AB  - A custom microarray was developed to study the temporal gene expression of the two groups of phages infecting the Gram-positive lactic acid bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus. The complete genomic sequence of the virulent cos-type phage DT1 (34,815 bp) and the pac-type phage 2972 (34,704 bp) were used for the construction of the microarray. Gene expression was measured at nine time intervals (0, 2, 7, 12, 17, 22, 27, 32 and 37 min) during phage infection and an expression curve was determined for each gene. Each phage gene was then classified into one of the three traditional transcription classes and these data were used to generate the complete transcriptional map of DT1 and 2972. Phage DT1 possesses 18 early genes, 12 middle genes and 12 late-expressed genes whereas 2972 has 16 early, 11 middle and 14 late genes. The trends of the phage gene expression profiles were also confirmed by slot blot hybridizations. Significant differences were observed when comparing the transcriptional maps of DT1 and 2972 with those already available for the S. thermophilus phages Sfi19 and Sfi21. To our knowledge, this report presents the first complete transcription analysis of bacteriophages infecting Gram-positive bacteria using the DNA microarray technology.
TI  - Urease biogenesis in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Urease biogenesis was monitored in the lactic acid bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus during the growth cycle using in-gel detection and a phenol-hypochloride assay. Zymogram analysis, performed in a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel, enabled visualization of a complex profile of bands whose number and intensity were dependent on the growth phase and culture conditions. The monitoring of urease biogenesis in batch fermentations revealed the onset of enzyme synthesis starting from the mid-exponential growth phase, with a maximum reached during the late exponential phase. Urease activity strongly increased at acidic pH but to a lesser extent when urea and nickel ions were added to the culture medium. When S. thermophilus cells were cultured with pH maintained at a neutral value, urease activity was detectable only in gel with extremely low signals. Evaluation of beta-glucuronidase activity in strain DSM 20617(T) harboring a transcriptional fusion between a DNA fragment containing the putative urease promoter and the gusA reporter evidenced significant expression at neutral pH that strongly increased in an acidic environment. Further experiments carried out on p(ureI)-gusA recombinant strain revealed that expression of ure genes was not affected by carbohydrates, nickel or urea availability. The presence of consistent expression of ure genes at neutral pH and the absence of induction of expression by carbohydrate availability demonstrated that the transcription of ure genes in S. thermophilus is regulated differently compared with that of the closely related S. salivarius. These differences are discussed taking into consideration the different habitats colonized by the two bacterial species.
TI  - Should yoghurt cultures be considered probiotic?
AB  - Probiotics are live micro-organisms that when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host. Consumption of yoghurt has been shown to induce measurable health benefits linked to the presence of live bacteria. A number of human studies have clearly demonstrated that yoghurt containing viable bacteria (Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii sp. bulgaricus) improves lactose digestion and eliminates symptoms of lactose intolerance. Thus, these cultures clearly fulfil the current concept of probiotics.
TI  - Characteristics of yogurt-like products prepared from the combination of skim milk and soymilk containing saccharified-rice solution.
AB  - Yogurt-like products were prepared from a combination of skim milk and soymilk (100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, and 0:100) containing saccharified-rice solution by lactic fermentation of four different cultures. The ratio of skim milk and soy milk had no significant effect on titratable acidity, while the type and nature of culture used for fermentation affected the titratable acidity. Lower syneresis was observed in soy-based yogurt, and both the hardness and springiness of curd increased as the proportion of soymilk in the substrate increased. Skim milk-based yogurt had higher resistance to shear force with higher yield stress. The sensory quality of yogurt produced from mixed culture had higher preference compared with that produced from a single culture (Streptococcus thermophilus). There was no significant difference in texture and overall acceptability among yogurts produced from mixed substrates and skim milk-based yogurt.
TI  - [Interferon induction by lacticacid bacteria in vitro and in vivo experiments].
AB  - Interferonogenic acitivity of lacticacid bacteria was studied in experiments in vitro and in vivo. It have been shown, that interferon induction depends both on strain species and on culture medium used for lactobacteria harvesting. Streptococcus thermophilus induces interferon more actively in leucocytes (in vitro)--1280 AU/ml on the bines broth medium, and less actively--320 AU/ml on fermented corn medium. Interferon induction in human leucocytes was not registered in case of L. plantarum 200 strain. In vivo experiments show that E. faecium strain and strain mixture of streptococcus termophilus are active interferon inductors. Induced interferon is recognized as alpha- and gamma-interferon, with domination of alpha-interferon.
TI  - Do probiotics reduce adult lactose intolerance? A systematic review.
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the efficacy of oral probiotics in adults with lactose intolerance through a systematic review of its effects on symptoms and breath hydrogen tests, and whether adding probiotics to nonfermented dairy products decreases lactose intolerance at that meal. METHODS: We searched randomized controlled trials published between 1966 and December 2002. Databases in the search strategy included Medline and AMED. We reviewed references of clinical trials and contacted authors of major articles and manufacturers of probiotic commercial products. Quality assessment was based on the McMaster guides and was performed by 5 independent reviewers. Data extraction was performed by 2 reviewers. RESULTS: A master list of 90 articles was compiled. Ten articles met inclusion and exclusion criteria and were consistent with our clinical question. Of the 9 studies that measured breath hydrogen, 3 were positive, 3 were negative, and 3 had both positive and negative results. Of the 7 studies that measured symptoms, 1 yielded positive results, 5 were negative, and 1 had both positive and negative outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotic supplementation in general did not alleviate the symptoms and signs of lactose intolerance in adults in this review. Some evidence suggests that specific strains, concentrations, and preparations are effective. Further clinical trials of specific strains and concentrations are necessary to delineate this potential therapeutic relationship.
TI  - Genomic organization and molecular analysis of virulent bacteriophage 2972 infecting an exopolysaccharide-producing Streptococcus thermophilus strain.
AB  - The Streptococcus thermophilus virulent pac-type phage 2972 was isolated from a yogurt made in France in 1999. It is a representative of several phages that have emerged with the industrial use of the exopolysaccharide-producing S. thermophilus strain RD534. The genome of phage 2972 has 34,704 bp with an overall G+C content of 40.15%, making it the shortest S. thermophilus phage genome analyzed so far. Forty-four open reading frames (ORFs) encoding putative proteins of 40 or more amino acids were identified, and bioinformatic analyses led to the assignment of putative functions to 23 ORFs. Comparative genomic analysis of phage 2972 with the six other sequenced S. thermophilus phage genomes confirmed that the replication module is conserved and that cos- and pac-type phages have distinct structural and packaging genes. Two group I introns were identified in the genome of 2972. They interrupted the genes coding for the putative endolysin and the terminase large subunit. Phage mRNA splicing was demonstrated for both introns, and the secondary structures were predicted. Eight structural proteins were also identified by N-terminal sequencing and/or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Detailed analysis of the putative minor tail proteins ORF19 and ORF21 as well as the putative receptor-binding protein ORF20 showed the following interesting features: (i) ORF19 is a hybrid protein, because it displays significant identity with both pac- and cos-type phages; (ii) ORF20 is unique; and (iii) a protein similar to ORF21 of 2972 was also found in the structure of the cos-type phage DT1, indicating that this structural protein is present in both S. thermophilus phage groups. The implications of these findings for phage classification are discussed.
TI  - Molecular and biochemical analysis of the galactose phenotype of dairy Streptococcus thermophilus strains reveals four different fermentation profiles.
AB  - Lactose-limited fermentations of 49 dairy Streptococcus thermophilus strains revealed four distinct fermentation profiles with respect to galactose consumption after lactose depletion. All the strains excreted galactose into the medium during growth on lactose, except for strain IMDOST40, which also displayed extremely high galactokinase (GalK) activity. Among this strain collection eight galactose-positive phenotypes sensu stricto were found and their fermentation characteristics and Leloir enzyme activities were measured. As the gal promoter seems to play an important role in the galactose phenotype, the galR-galK intergenic region was sequenced for all strains yielding eight different nucleotide sequences (NS1 to NS8). The gal promoter played an important role in the Gal-positive phenotype but did not determine it exclusively. Although GalT and GalE activities were detected for all Gal-positive strains, GalK activity could only be detected for two out of eight Gal-positive strains. This finding suggests that the other six S. thermophilus strains metabolize galactose via an alternative route. For each type of fermentation profile obtained, a representative strain was chosen and four complete Leloir gene clusters were sequenced. It turned out that Gal-positive strains contained more amino acid differences within their gal genes than Gal-negative strains. Finally, the biodiversity regarding lactose-galactose utilization among the different S. thermophilus strains used in this study was shown by RAPD-PCR. Five Gal-positive strains that contain nucleotide sequence NS2 in their galR-galK intergenic region were closely related.
TI  - Use of an alpha-galactosidase gene as a food-grade selection marker for Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The alpha-galactosidase gene (aga) of Lactococcus raffinolactis ATCC 43920 was previously shown to be an efficient food-grade selection marker in Lactococcus lactis and Pediococcus acidilactici but not in Streptococcus thermophilus. In this study, we demonstrated that the alpha-galactosidase of L. raffinolactis is thermolabile and inoperative at 42 degrees C, the optimal growth temperature of S. thermophilus. An in vitro assay indicated that the activity of this alpha-galactosidase at 42 degrees C was only 3% of that at 30 degrees C, whereas the enzyme retained 23% of its activity at 37 degrees C. Transformation of Strep. thermophilus RD733 with the shuttle-vector pNZ123 bearing the aga gene of L. raffinolactis (pRAF301) generated transformants that were stable and able to grow on melibiose and raffinose at 37 degrees C or below. The transformed cells possessed 6-fold more alpha-galactosidase activity after growth on melibiose than cells grown on lactose. Slot-blot analyses of aga mRNA indicated that repression by lactose occurred at the transcriptional level. The presence of pRAF301 did not interfere with the lactic acid production when the transformed cells of Strep. thermophilus were grown at the optimal temperature in milk. Using the recombinant plasmid pRAF301, which carries a chloramphenicol resistance gene in addition to aga, we showed that both markers were equally efficient at differentiating transformed from nontransformed cells. The aga gene of L. raffinolactis can be used as a highly efficient selection marker in Strep. thermophilus.
TI  - The specificity of oligopeptide transport by Streptococcus thermophilus resembles that of Lactococcus lactis and not that of pathogenic streptococci.
AB  - Peptide transport is a crucial step in the growth of Streptococcus thermophilus in protein- or peptide-containing media. The objective of the present work was to determine the specificity of peptide utilization by this widely used lactic acid bacterium. To reach that goal, complementary approaches were employed. The capability of a proteinase-negative S. thermophilus strain to grow in a chemically defined medium containing a mixture of peptides isolated from milk as the source of amino acids was analysed. Peptides were separated into three size classes by ultrafiltration. The strain was able to use peptides up to 3.5 kDa during growth, as revealed by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry analyses. The same strain was grown in chemically defined medium containing a tryptic digest of casein, and the respective time-course consumption of the peptides during growth was estimated. The ability to consume large peptides (up to 23 residues) was confirmed, as long as they are cationic and hydrophobic. These results were confirmed by peptide transport studies. Extension of the study to 11 other strains revealed that they all shared these preferences.
TI  - Glutamine synthesis is essential for growth of Streptococcus thermophilus in milk and is linked to urea catabolism.
AB  - Growth of a glutamine synthetase-deficient mutant of Streptococcus thermophilus was compared to that of the parent strain in milk that was not supplemented or was supplemented with ammonium chloride, glutamine, or the urease inhibitor flurofamide. It was concluded that one of the functions of urease is to supply ammonia for the synthesis of glutamine.
TI  - Functional interactions between the subunits of the lactose transporter from Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Although the quaternary state has been assessed in detail for only a few members  of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), it is clear that multiple oligomeric states are represented within the MFS. One of its members, the lactose transporter LacS from Streptococcus thermophilus assumes a dimeric structure in the membrane and in vitro analysis showed functional interactions between both subunits when proton motive force ((Delta)p)-driven transport was assayed. To study the interactions in further detail, a covalent dimer was constructed consisting of in tandem fused LacS subunits. These covalent dimers, composed of active and completely inactive subunits, were expressed in Escherichia coli, and initial rates of (Delta)p-driven lactose uptake and lactose counterflow were determined. We now show that also in vivo, both subunits interact functionally; that is, partial complementation of the inactive subunit was observed for both transport modes. Thus, both subunits interact functionally in (Delta)p-driven uptake and in counterflow transport. In addition, analysis of in tandem fused LacS subunits containing one regulatory LacS-IIA domain showed that regulation is primarily an intramolecular event.
TI  - Effect of fermented milk containing probiotic bacteria in the prevention of an enteroinvasive Escherichia coli infection in mice.
AB  - This study investigated the protective capacity of the oral administration of fermented milk containing the probiotic strains; Lactobacillus casei, Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus, against enteroinvasive Escherichia coli infection in a murine (BALB/ c mice) model. Mice were fed for 2, 5 or 7 consecutive days with fermented milk diluted to a concentration of viable Lb. casei, Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Strep. thermophilus of 10(7) cfu/ml. Phagocytic activity of peritoneal macrophages and the number of IgA+ cells in small and large intestine were determined at the end of the feeding periods. For the preventive effect against Esch. coli, animals were fed for 5 days (selected dose). Mice were challenged with an infective dose of enteroinvasive Esch. coli of 10(8) cfu/mouse. The colonization of liver and spleen and the secretory IgA specific for the pathogen in the intestinal fluid were determined (ELISA test). Results showed that the unspecific immune response enhanced itself after 5 consecutive days of the administration of this fermented milk (increase in the percentage of phagocytosis and number of IgA+ cells in the small intestine). Treated animals showed less Esch. coli colonization of liver than control mice and a higher secretory anti-Esch. coli IgA in the intestinal fluids. These results suggest that the protection against enteroinvasive Esch. coli infection observed for the fermented milk containing probiotic bacteria may be associated with an enhance of the intestinal mucosa immunity.
TI  - Low-fat mozzarella as influenced by microbial exopolysaccharides, preacidification, and whey protein concentrate.
AB  - Low-fat Mozzarella cheeses containing 6% fat were made by preacidification of milk, preacidification combined with exopolysaccharide- (EPS-) producing starter, used independently or as a coculture with non-EPS starter, and preacidification combined with whey protein concentrate (WPC) and EPS. The impact of these treatments on moisture retention, changes in texture profile analysis, cheese melt, stretch, and on pizza bake performance were investigated over 45 d of storage at 4 degrees C. Preacidified cheeses without EPS (control) had the lowest moisture content (53.75%). These cheeses were hardest and exhibited greatest springiness and chewiness. The meltability and stretchability of these cheeses increased most during the first 28 d of storage. The moisture content in cheeses increased to 55.08, 54.79, and 55.82% with EPS starter (containing 41.18 mg/g of EPS), coculturing (containing 28.61 mg/g of EPS), and WPC (containing 44.23 mg/g of EPS), respectively. Exopolysaccharide reduced hardness, springiness, and chewiness of low-fat cheeses made with preacidified milk in general and such cheeses exhibited an increase in cohesiveness and meltability. Although stretch distance was similar in all cheeses, those containing EPS were softer than the control. Cocultured cheeses exhibited the greatest meltability. Cheeses containing WPC were softest in general; however, hardness remained unchanged over 45 d. Cheeses made with WPC had the least increase in meltability over time. Incorporation of WPC did not reduce surface scorching or increase shred fusion of cheese shreds during pizza baking; however, there was an improvement in these properties between d 7 and 45. Coating of the cheese shreds with oil was necessary for adequate browning, melt, and flow characteristics in all cheese types.
TI  - Rapid identification of dairy lactic acid bacteria by M13-generated, RAPD-PCR fingerprint databases.
AB  - About a thousand lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific PCR and RAPD-PCR, respectively. RAPD-PCR profiles, which were obtained by using the M13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by BioNumerics software. Cluster analysis of the combined RAPD-PCR fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library, which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. A library unit, in this case, can be considered to be a definable taxon. The strains belonged to 11 main RAPD-PCR fingerprinting library units identified as Lactobacillus casei/paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus brevis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis. The possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. The proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful LAB strain collection. The same approach could also be applied to identify LAB strains isolated from other food ecosystems.
TI  - Use of probiotics in children with acute diarrhea.
AB  - Probiotics, defined as microbial cell preparations or components of microbial cells that have a beneficial effect on the health and well being of the host, have traditionally been used to treat and prevent a variety of infections. Beneficial effects of probiotics in acute infectious diarrhea in children seem to be: (i) moderate; (ii) strain-dependent; (iii) dose dependent; (iv) significant in watery diarrhea and viral gastroenteritis, but non-existent in invasive, bacterial diarrhea; and (v) more evident when treatment with probiotics is initiated early in the course of disease. Three large, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) provide evidence of a very modest effect (statistically significant, but of questionable clinical importance) of some probiotic strains (Lactobaccillus GG, Lactobaccillus reuteri, Bifodobacterium lactis) on the prevention of community-acquired diarrhea. We have found conflicting evidence from four RCTs on the efficacy of Lactobacillus GG and B. bifidum and Streptococcus thermophilus in the prevention of nosocomial diarrhea in children. Two RCTs in children provide evidence of a moderate beneficial effect of Lactobacillus GG in the prevention of antibacterial-associated diarrhea (AAD), but results in adults are conflicting. Data on the efficacy of other probiotic strains in AAD in children are very limited. In conclusion, to date, the most extensively studied and best documented clinical application of probiotics in children is for the treatment of acute watery diarrhea of rotaviral or presumably viral etiology. Studies documenting effects in other types of diarrheal diseases in children are limited, although some preliminary results are promising. The effects of different probiotic microorganisms are not equal. Only very few probiotic strains have been tested rigorously in RCTs. Many questions remain to be answered. Future clinical trials should evaluate carefully selected, precisely defined probiotic strains and address clinically important endpoints.
TI  - Marker-free chromosomal integration of the manganese superoxide dismutase gene (sodA) from Streptococcus thermophilus into Lactobacillus gasseri.
AB  - A strategy for functional gene replacement in the chromosome of Lactobacillus gasseri is described. The phospho-beta-galactosidase II gene (lacII) was functionally replaced by the manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) gene (sodA) from Streptococcus thermophilus, by adapting the insertional inactivation method described for lactobacilli [Russell, W.M. and Klaenhammer, T.R. 2001 Efficient system for directed integration into the Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus gasseri chromosomes via homologous recombination. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 67, 4361-4364]. L. gasseri carrying the heterologous sodA gene grew on lactose as efficiently as the wild-type parent. An active MnSOD was expressed in the transgenic strain, and the enzyme migrated on PAGE-SOD activity gels to the same position as that of MnSOD from S. thermophilus. The expression of MnSOD from a single copy of sodA integrated in the chromosome of L. gasseri provided enhanced tolerance to hydrogen peroxide, and extended the viability of carbon/energy starved cultures stored at 25 degrees C. This is the first report showing the successful utilization of the pORI plasmids system to generate marker-free gene integration in L. gasseri strains.
TI  - Characterization of a bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus faecium GM-1 isolated  from an infant.
AB  - AIM: To partially characterize the bacteriocin produced by the GM-1 strain of Enterococcus faecium, isolated from the faeces of a newborn human infant. METHODS AND RESULTS: The bacteriocin produced by E. faecium GM-1 showed a broad spectrum of activity against indicator strains of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio spp., Salmonella typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Streptococcus thermophilus. Treatment of the GM-1 bacteriocin with proteolytic enzymes reduced its inhibitory activities. The bacteriocin was stable at 100 degrees C for 20 min and displayed inhibitory activity at neutral pH. The optimal production of bacteriocin from E. faecium GM-1 was obtained when the culture conditions were pH 6.0-6.5 and 35-40 degrees C. The inhibitory activity of the bacteriocin was not substantially changed by the use of different carbon sources in the media, except when galactose was substituted for glucose. The use of a sole nitrogen source caused a decrease in inhibitory activity. A bacteriocin gene similar to enterocin P was identified from the total DNA of E. faecium GM-1 by PCR and direct sequencing methods. CONCLUSION: E. faecium GM-1, which was isolated from the faeces of a newborn baby, produces an enterocin P-like bacteriocin with inhibitory activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including food-borne pathogens. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: E. faecium GM-1, isolated from infant faeces, produces a new bacteriocin that is similar to enterocin P. This bacteriocin is heat stable and has a broad antibacterial spectrum that includes both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - A randomized formula controlled trial of Bifidobacterium lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus for prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in infants.
AB  - GOALS: This clinical trial was carried out to determine whether oral treatment with a commercial probiotic formula containing Bifidobacterium lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus would reduce the frequency of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) in infants. STUDY: In this double-bind formula controlled study, 80 infants, 6 to 36 months of age, were randomly assigned to receive a commercial formula containing 10 viable cells of B. lactis and 10 viable cells of S. thermophilus at the initiation of antibiotics for a duration of 15 days. The infants were assessed daily for formula intake, stool frequency, and stool consistency for a total duration of 30 days. Seventy-seven infants received nonsupplemented formula for the entire duration. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in the incidence of AAD in the children receiving probiotic-supplemented formula (16%) than nonsupplemented formula (31%). CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that prevention against AAD in infants was obtained by oral treatment with daily dose of B. lactis and S. thermophilus.
TI  - [Evaluation of the effect of probiotic cultures on two different yogurt brands over a known population of Staphylococcus aureus and the production of thermonuclease].
AB  - The effect of probiotic cultures over known populations of Staphylococcus aureus  inoculated in yogurt was studied; also the production and stability of its thermonuclease during yogurt storage was evaluated. In three different occasions, two different yogurt brands, one with additional probiotic cultures (Lactobacillus casei and L. acidophilus), were inoculated with known populations of S. aureus in high and low concentration (10(9) CFU/g and 10(7) CFU/g), respectively. These samples were stored for 28 days at 5 degrees C. Every four days the count of lactic bacteria, S. aureus and pH were evaluated, according to the methodology described in the Compendium of Methods for the Microbiological Examination of Foods, Vanderzant & Splittstoesser. The presence of thermonuclease was determined using petrifilm for S. aureus from 3M company. The pH and lactic bacteria population were constant during the testing period. Yogurt with additional probiotic cultures (high and low concentration) lowered the population of S. aureus to non detectable levels in 8 days; but, S. aureus could be cultured from yogurt without probiotics even after 24 days of incubation. Same time, the presence of thermonuclease was positive in all tests; it was not affected by probiotics. The presence of thermonuclease is related to the production of S. aureus enterotoxin. This work emphasizes again the beneficial effects of probiotic cultures in yogurt over bacteria and the importance of keeping hygienic practices in order to avoid the contamination of food with S. aureus and the eventual production of its enterotoxin, since it is not affected by probiotics.
TI  - cse, a Chimeric and variable gene, encodes an extracellular protein involved in cellular segregation in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The isolation of a Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ368 mutant displaying a long-chain phenotype allowed us to identify the cse gene (for cellular segregation). The N terminus of Cse exhibits high similarity to Streptococcus agalactiae surface immunogenic protein (SIP), while its C terminus exhibits high similarity to S. thermophilus PcsB. In CNRZ368, deletion of the entire cse open reading frame leads to drastic lengthening of cell chains and altered colony morphology. Complementation of the Deltacse mutation with a wild-type allele restored both wild-type phenotypes. The central part of Cse is a repeat-rich region with low sequence complexity. Comparison of cse from CNRZ368 and LMG18311 strains reveals high variability of this repeat-rich region. To assess the impact of this central region variability, the central region of LMG18311 cse was exchanged with that of CNRZ368 cse. This replacement did not affect chain length, showing that divergence of the central part does not modify cell segregation activity of Cse. The structure of the cse locus suggests that the chimeric organization of cse results from insertion of a duplicated sequence deriving from the pcsB 3' end into an ancestral sip gene. Thus, the cse locus illustrates the module-shuffling mechanism of bacterial gene evolution.
TI  - Sequence heterogeneity in the lacSZ operon of Streptococcus thermophilus and its  use in PCR systems for strain differentiation.
AB  - Sequences of the lacSZ operon of 29 Streptococcus thermophilus strains from different dairy products were determined. Differences in sequence among the strains were detected within LacS more often than in the LacZ gene. The sequences were aligned and compared and it was possible to gather the strains into three groups of similarity on the basis of the LacS gene sequence. The dairy environment of origin did not seem to be related to the lacSZ operon sequence and thus to the similarity shown. Nucleotide variability was investigated and a total of 139 nucleotide changes were found in the LacS gene while 40 nucleotide changes were found in the sequences of the LacZ gene. Moreover, the influence of the nucleotide changes on the amino acid sequence of the LacS transporter and of the beta-galactosidase enzyme were discussed. Sequence variability within the region upstream from the LacS gene was used to develop group-specific PCR systems capable of distinguishing S. thermophilus at the strain level. A strain-specific primer set was designed allowing the specific detection of 11 out of 29 strains of S. thermophilus. Moreover, LacS-PCR-SSCP analysis of the 29 strains provided 2 different profiles, whereas 4 strain-specific profiles were detected by LacS-PCR-DGGE, indicating the potential to use these techniques for profiling and monitoring population of strains of S. thermophilus in food products. The results are discussed with reference to the potential of these PCR methods for ascertaining strain dominance and starter fitness in dairy processes.
TI  - The doubly phosphorylated form of HPr, HPr(Ser~P)(His-P), is abundant in exponentially growing cells of Streptococcus thermophilus and phosphorylates the lactose transporter LacS as efficiently as HPr(His~P).
AB  - In Streptococcus thermophilus, lactose is taken up by LacS, a transporter that comprises a membrane translocator domain and a hydrophilic regulatory domain homologous to the IIA proteins and protein domains of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS). The IIA domain of LacS (IIALacS) possesses a histidine residue that can be phosphorylated by HPr(His~P), a protein component of the PTS. However, determination of the cellular levels of the different forms of HPr, namely, HPr, HPr(His~P), HPr(Ser-P), and HPr(Ser-P)(His~P), in exponentially lactose-growing cells revealed that the doubly phosphorylated form of HPr represented 75% and 25% of the total HPr in S. thermophilus ATCC 19258 and S. thermophilus SMQ-301, respectively. Experiments conducted with [32P]PEP and purified recombinant S. thermophilus ATCC 19258 proteins (EI, HPr, and IIALacS) showed that IIALacS was reversibly phosphorylated by HPr(Ser-P)(His~P) at a rate similar to that measured with HPr(His~P). Sequence analysis of the IIALacS protein domains from several S. thermophilus strains indicated that they can be divided into two groups on the basis of their amino acid sequences. The amino acid sequence of IIALacS from group I, to which strain 19258 belongs, differed from that of group II at 11 to 12 positions. To ascertain whether IIALacS from group II could also be phosphorylated by HPr(His~P) and HPr(Ser-P)(His~P), in vitro phosphorylation experiments were conducted with purified proteins from Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 25975, which possesses a IIALacS very similar to group II S. thermophilus IIALacS. The results indicated that S. salivarius IIALacS was phosphorylated by HPr(Ser-P)(His~P) at a higher rate than that observed with HPr(His~P). Our results suggest that the reversible phosphorylation of IIALacS in S. thermophilus is accomplished by HPr(Ser-P)(His~P) as well as by HPr(His~P).
TI  - Characterization of the cro-ori region of the Streptococcus thermophilus virulent bacteriophage DT1.
AB  - The virulent cos-type Streptococcus thermophilus phage DT1 was previously isolated from a mozzarella whey sample, and its complete genomic sequence is available. The putative ori of phage DT1 is characterized by three inverted and two direct repeats located in a noncoding region between orf36 and orf37. As the replication ability of the putative ori and flanking genes could not be established, its ability to confer phage resistance was tested. When ori is cloned on a high-copy-number plasmid, it provides protection to S. thermophilus strains against phage infection during milk fermentation. This protection is phage specific and strain dependent. Then, a detailed transcriptional map was established for the region located between the cro-like gene (orf29) and the ori. The results of the Northern blots indicated that the transcription of this region started 5 min after the onset of phage infection. Comparative analysis of the expression of the cro-ori region in the three S. thermophilus cos-type phages DT1, Sfi19 (virulent), and Sfi21 (temperate) reveals significant differences in the number and size of transcripts. The promoter upstream of orf29 was further investigated by primer extension analysis, and its activity was confirmed by a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay, which showed that the phage promoter is more efficient than the constitutive bacterial promoter of the S. thermophilus operon encoding the general proteins of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system. However, the phage promoter is less efficient than the pts promoter in Lactococcus lactis and in Escherichia coli.
TI  - Recombinant production of serine hydroxymethyl transferase from Streptococcus thermophilus and its preliminary evaluation as a biocatalyst.
AB  - The glyA gene encoding a serine hydroxymethyl transferase (SHMT) with threonine aldolase activity was isolated from Streptococcus thermophilus YKA-184 chromosomal DNA. This aldolase is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzyme that stereospecifically catalyzes the interconversion of L-threonine to glycine and acetaldehyde. The enzyme was overexpressed in Escherichia coli M15 as a recombinant protein of 45 kDa with a His6-tag at its N-terminus. The recombinant enzyme was purified to homogeneity by a single chromatographic step using Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity, obtaining a high activity-recovery yield (83%). Lyophilized and precipitated enzymes were stable at least for 10 weeks when stored at -20 degrees C and 4 degrees C. It was observed that the Km for L-allo-threonine was 38-fold higher than that for L-threonine, suggesting this enzyme can be classified as a specific L-allo-threonine aldolase. The optimum pH range of threonine aldolase activity for the recombinant SHMT was pH 6-7. When tested for aldol addition reactions with non-natural aldehydes, such as benzyloxyacetaldehyde and (R)-N-Cbz-alaninal, two possible beta-hydroxy-alpha-amino acid diastereoisomers were produced, but with moderate stereospecificity. The enzyme showed potential as a biocatalyst for the stereoselective synthesis of beta-hydroxy-alpha-amino acids.
TI  - Cloning vectors based on cryptic plasmids isolated from lactic acid bacteria: their characteristics and potential applications in biotechnology.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are Gram positive bacteria, widely distributed in nature, and industrially important as they are used in a variety of industrial food fermentations. The use of genetic engineering techniques is an effective means of enhancing the industrial applicability of LAB. However, when using genetic engineering technology, safety becomes an essential factor for the application of improved LAB to the food industry. Cloning and expression systems should be derived preferably from LAB cryptic plasmids that generally encode genes for which functions can be proposed, but no phenotypes can be observed. However, some plasmid-encoded functions have been discovered in cryptic plasmids originating from Lactobacillus, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Pediococcus spp. and can be used as selective marker systems in vector construction. This article presents information concerning LAB cryptic plasmids, and their structures, functions, and applications. A total of 134 cryptic plasmids collated are discussed.
TI  - Genome update: 2D clustering of bacterial genomes.
AB  
TI  - Molecular and microbiological analysis of caecal microbiota in rats fed with diets supplemented either with prebiotics or probiotics.
AB  - The potential health-improving effects of both a prebiotic and a probiotic infant formula have been evaluated in a rat model. Two groups of 10 rats were fed with either prebiotics containing fructo-oligosaccharides or probiotics containing viable Bifidobacterium lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus. The composition of their caecal microbiota was analyzed both by classical plate count of the main bacterial groups and by PCR amplification of a V3 fragment of 16S rRNA genes and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Both diets induced a significant reduction of clostridia and Bacteroides spp. compared to a control diet, whereas prebiotics were also able to reduce the number of coliforms and to increase the presence of bifidobacteria. DGGE analysis showed a significant increase of 16S rRNA gene fragments in rats fed with either probotics or prebiotics. Nineteen bands were sequenced and most of them showed similarity to cultured bacteria. Detection of Bifidobacterium spp. by this technique using genus-specific primers only permitted these bacteria to be detected in prebiotics-fed rats, whereas the use of Lactobacillus group-specific primers gave similar results in rats fed with any diet, in agreement with the plate count results.
TI  - Fermented milk-starch and milk-inulin products as vehicles for lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Formulations using cassava starch or inulin plus milk were fermented with three different lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains: Lactobacillus plantarum D34, Lactobacillus sp. SLH6, and Streptococcus thermophilus ST4. Growth and acidification were followed in 3% powdered milk (M3), 3% milk-6% starch (M3-S6), and 3% milk-6% inulin (M3-In6). D34 and SLH6 growth was enhanced by starch in M3-S6, when compared to the count (CFU/ml) obtained in M3. Growth of all strains was promoted by inulin. All fermented products showed LAB counts of 8.0 log or higher. Carbohydrate utilization was in agreement with growth and acidification results. The highest increase in CFU in rat feces was observed in M3-S6 fermented with ST4; the D34 fermented product also increased CFU but SLH6 did not, either with starch or inulin. This suggests that ST4 and D34 strains provide a good choice to ferment the proposed formulations in order to obtain a marked improvement of natural intestinal flora.
TI  - Rapid separation of microorganisms by quartz microchip capillary electrophoresis.
AB  - We developed and optimized a system coupling microchip capillary electrophoresis  (MCE) and laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detection for the analysis of microorganisms. The MCE-LIF system successfully separated pure cultures of lactic acid bacteria and Saccharomyces cerevisiae within 200 s. The results indicate that the MCE system can be conveniently used for the rapid and highly sensitive detection of microorganisms. Thus, MCE can provide a cheap and simple method for the on-line detection of microbial contamination.
TI  - Influence of immobilization parameters on growth and lactic acid production by Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus co-immobilized in calcium alginate gel beads.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus were co-immobilized in different systems with varying calcium (0.1-1.5 M) and alginate (1-2%, w/v) concentrations. Highest lactic acid production was 35 g l(-1) when both bacteria were in high viscosity beads (1%, w/v alginate) hardened in 0.1 M CaCl2 . The gel bead composition affected size and distribution of entrapped lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Collapse temperature of bacterial suspensions: the effect of cell type and concentration.
AB  - The characterisation of the physical state of frozen and freeze dried biological  products delivers powerful information for freeze-drying process optimisation. The influence of lactic acid bacterial cell size, shape and concentration on collapse temperature of concentrated bacterial suspensions was investigated. Lactobacillus bulgaricus (long rods), and Streptococcus thermophilus (small spherical cells) were used as cellular models for this study. Whatever the strain, when lactic acid bacterial cells were added to protective solutions, the collapse temperature increased, thus allowing the use of higher sublimation temperatures during primary drying than expected from the protective medium alone. Moreover, the higher the cell concentration, the greater the effect, linear relationships existing between the collapse temperatures and the total dried matter. Cells of both strains gave a kind of robustness to the freeze-dried product, but the increase observed in collapse temperature was considerably higher (3 - 5 degree C) for L. bulgaricus compared to S. thermophilus. This result was ascribed to the different size and shape of the strains.
TI  - Scarce evidence of yogurt lactic acid bacteria in human feces after daily yogurt  consumption by healthy volunteers.
AB  - In a double-blind prospective study including 114 healthy young volunteers, the presence in human feces of the yogurt organisms Lactobacillus delbrueckii and Streptococcus thermophilus after repeated yogurt consumption (15 days) was analyzed by culture, specific PCR, and DNA hybridization of total fecal DNA. Detection of yogurt lactic acid bacteria in total fecal DNA by bacterial culture and PCR assay was consistently negative. DNA compatible with yogurt bacteria was found by hybridization experiments in only 10 (10.52%) of 96 individuals after consumption of fresh yogurt and in 2 (2.10%) of 96 individuals after consumption of pasteurized yogurt (P = 0.01).
TI  - Structural studies of an exopolysaccharide produced by Streptococcus thermophilus THS.
AB  - The structure of an extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) from Streptococcus thermophilus THS has been determined. A combination of component analysis, methylation analysis and NMR spectroscopy shows that the polysaccharide is composed of pentasaccharide repeating units. Sequential information was obtained by two-dimensional (1)H,(1)H-NOESY and (1)H,(13)C-HMBC NMR experiments. NMR data indicate different mobility within the EPS with a stiffer backbone and a more flexible side-chain.
TI  - Identification of probiotic microorganisms in South African products using PCR-based DGGE analysis.
AB  - Probiotic microorganisms in commercial yoghurts and other food products are currently identified by traditional methods such as growth on selective media, morphological and biochemical characteristics. In this study, PCR-based DGGE analysis was used for the rapid and accurate identification of probiotic microorganisms from South African yoghurts and lyophilized preparations in capsule and tablet form. To identify the microorganisms present in these products, the DGGE profiles obtained were compared to two reference markers (A and B) composed of five lactobacilli and seven Bifidobacterium species, respectively. The results obtained were confirmed by species-specific PCR, as well as sequence analyses of unknown bands not present in the reference markers. It was found that only 54.5% of the probiotic yoghurts contained the microorganisms stated on the label compared to only a third (33.3%) of the lyophilized probiotic products. Some Bifidobacterium species were incorrectly identified and various microorganisms were detected that were not listed on the label. Sequence analyses confirmed the presence of Streptococcus spp. other than the yoghurt starter, Streptococcus thermophilus, in some of these products and in some instances label information was vague and non-scientific. PCR-based DGGE analyses proved to be a valuable culture-independent approach for the rapid and specific identification of the microbial species present in South African probiotic products.
TI  - [Influence of live flora on lactose digestion in male adult lactose-malabsorbers  after dairy products intake].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of live flora on lactose absorption in male adult lactose-malabsorbers. METHODS: After giving consents, 45 health male adult volunteers were challenged with 20 g lactose in 200 ml water in the morning without breakfast. The expired samples of breath were collected at every 30 min point in 3 hours. 24 persons were chosen as subjects (lactose-malabsorbers) when their expired H2 of any time point was 30 micromol/mol more than the baseline, and divided into 3 groups randomly. The test dairy were yogurt (Y) and heat-treated yogurt (HY), and acidified gelled milk (M), all containing 20 g lactose. The study was double blind, randomized and 3 x 3 latin square design. Three group subjects ingested the 3 different dairy products in 3 different days. The washout time was 7 days. After drinking each dairy in the morning without breakfast, the expired samples at every 30 min were collected during 8 hours test time with no food and no violent exercise. Hydrogen concentration of expired sample was detected by gas chromatography. RESULTS: The peak hydrogen concentration (Cmax) of yogurt is significant less than heat-treated yogurt and milk (Y 113.2 +/- 70.2, HY 186.5 +/- 96.7, M 174.7 +/- 73.9). The peak time of Cmax (Tmax) of yogurt is significant more than milk (Y 390 +/- 86, M 305 +/- 105). The area under the hydrogen concentration curve (AUC) of yogurt is significant less than the other two dairy products (Y 14,900.1 +/- 12,206.2, HY 27,389.5 +/- 20,429.8, M 25,648.2 +/- 14,064.0). CONCLUSION: The live flora in dairy product could improve lactose digestion in male adult lactose malabsorbers.
TI  - Molecular identification of monomeric aspartate racemase from Bifidobacterium bifidum.
AB  - Bifidobacterium bifidum is a useful probiotic agent exhibiting health-promoting properties and contains d-aspartate as an essential component of the cross-linker moiety in the peptidoglycan. To help understand D-aspartate biosynthesis in B. bifidum NBRC 14252, aspartate racemase, which catalyzes the racemization of D- and L-aspartate, was purified to homogeneity and characterized. The enzyme was a monomer with a molecular mass of 27 kDa. This is the first report showing the presence of a monomeric aspartate racemase. Its enzymologic properties, such as its lack of cofactor requirement and susceptibility to thiol-modifying reagents in catalysis, were similar to those of the dimeric aspartate racemase from Streptococcus thermophilus. The monomeric enzyme, however, showed a novel characteristic, namely, that its thermal stability significantly increased in the presence of aspartate, especially the D-enantiomer. The gene encoding the monomeric aspartate racemase was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli cells. The nucleotide sequence of the aspartate racemase gene encoded a peptide containing 241 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 26 784 Da. The recombinant enzyme was purified to homogeneity and its properties were almost the same as those of the B. bifidum enzyme.
TI  - The relevance of genetic analysis to dairy bacteria: building upon our heritage.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are essential for the manufacture of fermented dairy products. Studies on the physiology, biochemistry and genetics of these microorganisms over the last century have contributed considerably to the improvement of fermentation processes and have resulted in better and safer products. Nevertheless, the potential of LAB is far from being maximized. The sophistication of biotechnologies and the availability of complete genome sequences have opened the door to the metabolic engineering of LAB. In this regard, the recent publication of the complete genome sequences of two Streptococcus thermophilus strains will provide a key tool to facilitate the genetic manipulation of this important dairy species.
TI  - [Use of Phaseolus vulgaris and Vigna sinensis in a fermented dairy drink].
AB  - The objective of this work was to develop a new kind fermented dairy drink, partially substituted with clear varieties of Phaseolus vulgaris (caraota) and Vigna sinensis (frijol). The formulation of fermented dairy drinks included sterile extracts of caraota and frijol, as partial substitutes which replaced milk: 10, 20 and 30%. The mixtures were inoculated with 2% of a mixture of Lactobacillus acidophillus, Streptococcus thermophilus and Bifidobacterium sp. and were incubated at 42 degrees C for 7 hours. Mango and guava jams were used as flavorings at 20%. On the basis of the sensorial evaluation the mixtures 10% frijol-mango, 10% frijol-guava, 30% caraota-mango and 20% caraota-guava were selected. In the selected fermented dairy drinks, the levels of protein, soluble and insoluble fiber, available and resistant starches were increased and the protein digestibility was 81%. The technical feasibility of partial substitution of milk with extracts of Phaseolus vulgaris or Vigna sinensis. For the elaboration of a fermented dairy drink similar to the liquid yogurt kind was demonstrated.

TI  - Fermentation conditions affecting the bacterial growth and exopolysaccharide production by Streptococcus thermophilus ST 111 in milk-based medium.
AB  - AIMS: To study the effect of different fermentation conditions and to model the effect of temperature and pH on different biokinetic parameters of bacterial growth and exopolysaccharides (EPS) production of Streptococcus thermophilus ST 111 in milk-based medium. METHODS AND RESULTS: The influence of temperature and pH was studied through fermentation and modelling. Fermentations under non-pH controlled conditions with S. thermophilus ST 111 indicated that the EPS production was low in milk medium, even if additional nitrogen sources were supplemented. Under pH-controlled conditions, addition of whey protein hydrolysate to the milk medium resulted in a fivefold increase of the EPS production. This medium did not contain polysaccharides interfering with EPS isolation. Primary and secondary modelling of different fermentations revealed an optimum temperature and pH of 40 degrees C and constant pH 6.2, respectively, for growth in milk medium supplemented with whey protein hydrolysate. Maximum EPS production was observed in the range of 32-42 degrees C and constant pH 5.5-6.6. Whereas growth and maximum EPS production were clearly influenced by temperature and pH, the specific EPS production was only affected by stress conditions (T = 49 degrees C). CONCLUSIONS: Addition of whey protein hydrolysate to milk medium resulted in an increased growth and EPS production of S. thermophilus ST 111 under pH-controlled conditions. A modelling approach allowed studying the influence of temperature and pH on the kinetics of both growth and EPS production. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The use of an appropriate milk-based medium and a combined model of temperature and pH can be of practical importance for the production of yoghurt or other fermented milks as well as for process optimization of the large-scale production of starter strains to be used for their EPS production.
TI  - Complete sequence and comparative genome analysis of the dairy bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The lactic acid bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus is widely used for the manufacture of yogurt and cheese. This dairy species of major economic importance is phylogenetically close to pathogenic streptococci, raising the possibility that it has a potential for virulence. Here we report the genome sequences of two yogurt strains of S. thermophilus. We found a striking level of gene decay (10% pseudogenes) in both microorganisms. Many genes involved in carbon utilization are nonfunctional, in line with the paucity of carbon sources in milk. Notably, most streptococcal virulence-related genes that are not involved in basic cellular processes are either inactivated or absent in the dairy streptococcus. Adaptation to the constant milk environment appears to have resulted in the stabilization of the genome structure. We conclude that S. thermophilus has evolved mainly through loss-of-function events that remarkably mirror the environment of the dairy niche resulting in a severely diminished pathogenic potential.
TI  - Molecular quantification of lactic acid bacteria in fermented milk products using real-time quantitative PCR.
AB  - Real-time quantitative PCR assays were developed for the absolute quantification  of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) (Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, L. casei, L. paracasei, L. rhamnosus, L. acidophilus and L. johnsonii) in fermented milk products. The results of molecular quantification and classic bacterial enumeration did not differ significantly with respect to S. thermophilus and the species of the L. casei group which were detected in the six commercial fermented products tested, thus showing that DNA extraction was efficient and that genomic DNA solutions were free of PCR inhibitors. For L. delbrueckii, the results of bacterial enumeration were generally lower by a factor 10 to 100 than those of PCR quantification, suggesting a loss of viability during storage of the dairy products at 1-8 degrees C for most of the strains in this species. Real-time quantitative assays enabled identification of the species of lactic acid bacterial strains initially present in commercial fermented milk products and their accurate quantification with a detection threshold of 10(3) cells per ml of product.
TI  - In vitro antibiotic susceptibility of lactobacilli isolated from commercial products containing active lactobacilli.
AB  - To survey the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of some commercially available Lactobacillus, we collected four commercial products that contain active Lactobacillus. We incubated individual product and identified these colonies by the methods of API50 CH test kit and RAPID ID 32A kit. Strains of Streptococcus thermophilus, Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei were collected. By agar dilution method, each identified strain was inoculated to Brucella blood agar-MIC plates. Each plate contained one of the following antibiotics with different concentrations: amoxicillin, cephalothin, gentamicin, vancomycin, erythromycin, rifampin, tetracyclin and penicillin G, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, cefmetazole, metronidazole, ampicillin/sulbactum, cefoxtin, etc. After incubation, the growth condition of each Brucella blood agar-MIC plate was observed and the breakpoint of each antibiotic to different Lactobacillus products determined. The MICs of amoxicillin, ampicillin/sulbactum and penicillin-G to all identified strains were < or =2 microg/ml and those of vancomycin, clindamycin, erythromycin, metronidazole, cefmetazole and cefoxtin for L. casei were >32 microg/ml. L. casei was more resistant to all the testing antibiotics than the other strains. According to the MICs of the above antibiotics, proper active lactobacillus products could be chosen to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea in the pediatric field.
TI  - Comparison of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase gene (fbp) sequences for the identification of Lactobacillus rhamnosus.
AB  - Comparative analysis of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase gene (fbp) sequences was evaluated for the differentiation of reference and clinical strains of Lactobacillus rhamnosus. The sequences of 1,971 nucleotides of the fbp gene were determined on both DNA strands for 21 L. rhamnosus strains, representing reference, probiotic, and clinical strains. No PCR amplification of the fbp gene was observed for other species of the Lactobacillus casei complex (L. casei and L. zeae) or strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Escherichia coli. Phylogenetic analysis of the fbp putative amino acid sequences of L. rhamnosus strains by the neighbor-joining method showed clear distinct positions of this species. The phylogenetic tree, derived from fbp nucleotide sequences, showed four clear divisions between strains of L. rhamnosus. From a taxonomic point of view, our results confirm for the first time that fbp gene sequences have high discriminating power for strains of L. rhamnosus that are difficult to differentiate.
TI  - Probiotics enhance the recovery of gut atrophy in experimental malnutrition.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of probiotics on the recovery of the bowel atrophy induced by malnutrition in rats. METHODS: Twenty-and-six Wistar rats (200-250g) were fed with either a normoproteic (sham group, n=6) or a free-protein diet (n=20) during 12 days. Twelve malnourished rats were randomized to recover during 15 days with either a hydrolyzed diet (control group, n=6) or the same diet enriched with probiotics (Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus helveticus; probiotic group, n=6). RESULTS: Probiotic group showed similar gain of body, liver and bowel weight than controls. At the jejunum, both the villus height (383+/-49 vs. 321+/-46mm; p=0.04) and crypt depth (157+/-31 vs. 125+/-10mm; p=0.04) were greater in probiotic group than in controls. The crypt depth at the cecum (214+/-22 vs. 169+/-43 mm; p=0.05) and the wall width at both the cecum (410+/-18 vs. 340+/-61 mm; p=0.02) and sigmoid (479+/-130 vs. 330+/-62 mm; p=0.03) were higher in probiotic than in control group. CONCLUSION: Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus helveticus enhance the recovery of gut atrophy induced by malnutrition. Probiotics can be useful as oral adjuvants during the recovery of malnutrition.
TI  - Selection and properties of Streptococcus thermophilus mutants deficient in urease.
AB  - Natural variations of the urea content of milk have a detrimental effect on the regularity of acidification by Streptococcus thermophilus strains used in dairy processes. The aim of the present study was to select urease-deficient mutants of S. thermophilus and to investigate their properties. Using an improved screening medium on agar plates, mutants were selected from 4 different parent strains after mutagen treatment and by spontaneous mutation. Most mutants were stable and had a phage sensitivity profile similar to that of their parent strain. Some of them contained detrimental secondary mutations, as their acidifying activity was lower than that of the parent strain cultivated in the presence of the urease inhibitor flurofamide. The proportion of this type of mutant was much lower among spontaneous mutants than among mutants selected after mutagen treatment. Utilization of urease-deficient mutants in dairy processes may have several advantages, such as an increase in acidification, an improved regularity of acidification, and a lower production of ammonia in whey.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of lactophoricin, a synthetic 23-residues peptide derived  from the sequence of bovine milk component-3 of proteose peptone.
AB  - A synthetic peptide of 23 residues corresponding to the carboxyterminal 113 to 135 region of component-3 of proteose peptone (PP3) has been investigated with regard to its antibacterial properties. This cationic amphipathic peptide that we refer to as lactophoricin, displayed a growth-inhibitory activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. For most of the strains tested, bacterial growth was observed in the presence of lactophoricin except for Streptococcus thermophilus. In that case, lactophoricin exhibited a minimum inhibitory concentration of 10 microM and a minimum lethal concentration of 20 microM. No hemolysis of human red blood cells was detected for peptide concentrations between 2 to 200 microM, indicating that lactophoricin would be noncytotoxic when used in this concentration range.

TI  - Characterization of oxidative stress-resistant mutants of Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ368.
AB  - During industrial processes, the dairy organism Streptococcus thermophilus is exposed to stress conditions. Its ability to survive and grow in an aerobic environment indicates that it must possess defensive mechanisms against reactive oxygen species. To identify the genes involved in oxidative stress defence, a collection of mutants was generated by random insertional mutagenesis and screened for menadione sensitivity and resistance. Results obtained for resistant clones allowed the identification of eight loci. The insertions affected genes whose homologues in other bacteria were previously identified as being involved in stress response(deoB, gst) or transcription regulation (rggC) and five ORFs of unknown function. The tolerance of the eight mutants to air-exposure, methyl viologen and H2O2 was studied. Real-time quantitative PCR was used to analyse the transcript level of mutated genes and revealed that most were down-regulated during oxidative stress.
TI  - Fast induction of nisin resistance in Streptococcus thermophilus INIA 463 during  growth in milk.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus INIA 463 became nisin-resistant after exposure in skim milk to subminimal inhibitory concentrations of nisin (1-3 IU/ml) for less than 2 h. Addition of 20 IU/ml caused a 4 log unit decrease in S. thermophilus counts of a culture not exposed previously to nisin, whereas no decrease was observed in the culture exposed to nisin for 2 h. Transfer of immunity genes as responsible for nisin resistance was discarded. The presence of extracellular or intracellular specific nisin-degrading enzymes was not detected in the nisin-resistant variant of S. thermophilus INIA 463. Nisin resistance was caused by the induction of a resistance mechanism. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that the nisin-resistant variant of S. thermophilus INIA 463 had a thickened cell wall compared to the wild strain. Resistance to nisin was lost after one transfer (4 h growth) in nisin-free skim milk.
TI  - Influence of starter culture ratios and warm room treatment on free fatty acid and amino acid in Swiss cheese.
AB  - Quantification of water-soluble volatile free fatty acids (FFA) and free amino acids (FAA) was performed as a ripening index and an indirect measure of flavor development in Swiss-type cheeses. The objective of this research was to assess the effect of warm room treatment (WRT) and usage ratio of starter cultures, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus helveticus vs. propionibacteria, on the concentration of FFA and FAA in pilot plant-scale Swiss cheese. A capillary gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector was used for the analysis of FFA in Swiss cheese. Free amino acids were analyzed by the Cd-ninhydrin method. Starter culture ratios did not affect development of FAA during the cheese ripening. However, duration of WRT had an effect on the concentration of FAA in the Swiss cheese. Free amino acids increased considerably during WRT. A continuous increase in FAA was shown during 70-d ripening time after WRT. The concentrations of C2:0 and C3:0 fatty acids were affected by starter culture ratios after 2-wk WRT, but these differences had mostly disappeared after 3-wk WRT. Similar concentrations of FFA and FAA reported in previous studies were developed in Swiss cheese with a 3-wk WRT and a 0.33:1 ratio of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus helveticus to propionibacteria.
TI  - Atomic force microscopic corroboration of bond aging for adhesion of Streptococcus thermophilus to solid substrata.
AB  - Initial bacterial adhesion is considered to be reversible, but over time the adhesive bond between a bacterium and a substratum surface may strengthen, turning the process into an irreversible state. Microbial desorption has been studied in situ in controlled flow devices as a function of the organisms resident time on the surface (J. Colloid Interface Sci. 164 (1994) 355). It appeared that desorption of Streptococcus thermophilus decreased strongly within approximately 50 s after initial adhesion due to bond aging. In this paper, bond aging between the S. thermophilus cell surface and the silicon nitride tip of an AFM (atomic force microscope) is corroborated microscopically and related to the macroscopic, residence time-dependent desorption of the organism under flow. AFM indicated bond strengthening between the tip and the cell surface within 100 s of contact, which is on the same order of magnitude as bond aging inferred from residence time-dependent desorption. Comparison of the interaction energies derived from AFM and macroscopic desorption indicate that bond strengthening arises as a result of multiple attachments of extracellular polymeric substances to a substratum surface.
TI  - Influence of synbiotic containing Lactobacillus acidophilus La5, Bifidobacterium  lactis Bb 12, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus and oligofructose on gut barrier function and sepsis in critically ill patients: a randomised controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Infective complications are a common cause of mortality and morbidity in critically ill patients. Many factors affect sepsis, one of which is gut barrier function. The aim of this study was to determine whether the oral administration of a synbiotic preparation could alter gut barrier function in critically ill patients and thus reduce sepsis. METHODS: A total of 90 patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) were randomised to receive either synbiotic or placebo preparations (45 into each group). The synbiotic preparation consisted of Lactobacillus acidophilus La5, Bifidobacterium lactis Bb 12, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus (probiotics) with oligofructose (prebiotic). Gut barrier function was assessed by measurement of intestinal permeability (lactulose/rhamnose test) and culture of nasogastric aspirate on days 1 and 8. All septic complications and mortality were recorded. RESULTS: There were no differences between the groups in terms of age, sex, APACHE II or POSSUM scores. After 1 week of therapy, patients in the synbiotic group had a significantly lower incidence of potentially pathogenic bacteria (43% versus 75%, P = 0.05) and multiple organisms (39% versus 75%, P = 0.01) in their nasogastric aspirates than controls. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of intestinal permeability, septic complications or mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of synbiotic in critically ill patients favourably altered the microbial composition of the upper gastrointestinal tract but had no effect on intestinal permeability and was not associated with measurable clinical benefit.
TI  - Temporal transcription map of the virulent Streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophage Sfi19.
AB  - A transcription map was developed for the virulent Streptococcus thermophilus phage Sfi19 on the basis of systematic Northern blot hybridizations. All deduced 5' ends were confirmed by primer extension experiments. Three classes of transcripts were detected based on the different times of appearance. Early transcripts were identified in three genome regions; middle transcripts covered cro-like, DNA replication, and transcriptional regulation genes; and late genes consisted of structural and lysis genes. Chloramphenicol treatment suppressed the translation of a putative transcriptional factor necessary for the production of late transcripts and shifted middle transcripts to early transcription times.
TI  - Expression of a heterologous manganese superoxide dismutase gene in intestinal lactobacilli provides protection against hydrogen peroxide toxicity.
AB  - In living organisms, exposure to oxygen provokes oxidative stress. A widespread mechanism for protection against oxidative stress is provided by the antioxidant enzymes: superoxide dismutases (SODs) and hydroperoxidases. Generally, these enzymes are not present in Lactobacillus spp. In this study, we examined the potential advantages of providing a heterologous SOD to some of the intestinal lactobacilli. Thus, the gene encoding the manganese-containing SOD (sodA) was cloned from Streptococcus thermophilus AO54 and expressed in four intestinal lactobacilli. A 1.2-kb PCR product containing the sodA gene was cloned into the shuttle vector pTRK563, to yield pSodA, which was functionally expressed and complemented an Escherichia coli strain deficient in Mn and FeSODs. The plasmid, pSodA, was subsequently introduced and expressed in Lactobacillus gasseri NCK334, Lactobacillus johnsonii NCK89, Lactobacillus acidophilus NCK56, and Lactobacillus reuteri NCK932. Molecular and biochemical analyses confirmed the presence of the gene (sodA) and the expression of an active gene product (MnSOD) in these strains of lactobacilli. The specific activities of MnSOD were 6.7, 3.8, 5.8, and 60.7 U/mg of protein for L. gasseri, L. johnsonii, L. acidophilus, and L. reuteri, respectively. The expression of S. thermophilus MnSOD in L. gasseri and L. acidophilus provided protection against hydrogen peroxide stress. The data show that MnSOD protects cells against hydrogen peroxide by removing O(2)(.-) and preventing the redox cycling of iron. To our best knowledge, this is the first report of a sodA from S. thermophilus being expressed in other lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Characterization of a galactokinase-positive recombinant strain of Streptococcus  thermophilus.
AB  - The lactic acid bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus is widely used by the dairy  industry for its ability to transform lactose, the primary sugar found in milk, into lactic acid. Unlike the phylogenetically related species Streptococcus salivarius, S. thermophilus is unable to metabolize and grow on galactose and thus releases substantial amounts of this hexose into the external medium during growth on lactose. This metabolic property may result from the inability of S. thermophilus to synthesize galactokinase, an enzyme of the Leloir pathway that phosphorylates intracellular galactose to generate galactose-1-phosphate. In this work, we report the complementation of Gal(-) strain S. thermophilus SMQ-301 with S. salivarius galK, the gene that codes for galactokinase, and the characterization of recombinant strain SMQ-301K01. The recombinant strain, which was obtained by transformation of strain SMQ-301 with pTRKL2TK, a plasmid bearing S. salivarius galK, grew on galactose with a generation time of 55 min, which was almost double the generation time on lactose. Data confirmed that (i) the ability of SMQ-301K01 to grow on galactose resulted from the expression of S. salivarius galK and (ii) transcription of the plasmid-borne galK gene did not require GalR, a transcriptional regulator of the gal and lac operons, and did not interfere with the transcription of these operons. Unexpectedly, recombinant strain SMQ-301K01 still expelled galactose during growth on lactose, but only when the amount of the disaccharide in the medium exceeded 0.05%. Thus, unlike S. salivarius, the ability to metabolize galactose was not sufficient for S. thermophilus to simultaneously metabolize the glucose and galactose moieties of lactose. Nevertheless, during growth in milk and under time-temperature conditions that simulated those used to produce mozzarella cheese, the recombinant Gal(+) strain grew and produced acid more rapidly than the Gal(-) wild-type strain.
TI  - Exopolysaccharides produced by mixed culture of yeast Rhodotorula rubra GED10 and yogurt bacteria (Streptococcus thermophilus 13a + Lactobacillus bulgaricus 2-11).
AB  - AIMS: The studies of the production of exopolysaccharides by lactose-negative yeast and a yogurt starter co-cultivated in a natural substrate containing lactose may be considered of interest because they reveal the possibilities for high-efficiency synthesis of biopolymers by mixed cultivation. METHODS AND RESULTS: The mixed culture Rhodotorula rubra GED10 + (Streptococcus thermophilus 13a + Lactobacillus bulgaricus 2-11) was cultivated in cheese whey ultrafiltrate (WU) (44.0 g lactose l(-1)) at initial pH 6.0, 28 degrees C, under intensive aeration (air-flow rate 1.0 l l(-1) min(-1), agitation 220 rev min(-1)) in a MBR AG fermentor. The mixed culture manifested the highest activity for synthesis of exopolysaccharides (19.3 g l(-1)) and cell mass (21.0 g l(-1)) at the 84th hour. The yogurt starter synthesized neutral exopolysaccharides, while the mixed culture yeast + yogurt starter produced acidic exopolysaccharides containing uronic acid (6%). The neutral sugar composition was identified as mannose, glucose, galactose, xylose and arabinose. Mannose dominated in the polymer composition (83%) that was produced only by the yeast (97%). CONCLUSIONS: Lactose in the WU can be effectively utilized by a co-culture of lactose-negative yeast-yogurt starter for synthesis of exopolysaccharides. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The present findings propose an alternative use of WU as a cost-effective carbohydrate substrate, and suggest that the lactose-negative yeast Rhodotorula rubra can have industrial application as producers of exopolysaccharides.
TI  - Effects of long-term consumption of a fermented infant formula (with Bifidobacterium breve c50 and Streptococcus thermophilus 065) on acute diarrhea in healthy infants.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether long-term consumption of a fermented infant formula could influence the incidence of acute diarrhea and its severity in healthy infants. METHOD: Nine hundred seventy-one infants, ranging in age from 4 to 6 months, were included in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial during a period of 5 months. They consumed daily either a fermented infant formula (FF) (fermentation with Bifidobacterium breve C50 and Streptococcus thermophilus 065) or a standard infant formula (SF) of the same nutritional composition. EVALUATION CRITERIA: Number and duration of acute diarrhea episodes were evaluated. Severity of the episodes was determined by the number of hospital admissions, incidence of dehydration, number of medical consultations, number of oral rehydration solution prescriptions, and number of formula switches. RESULTS: Growth of the infants and acceptability of the formulas were identical in the two groups. Incidence, duration of diarrhea episodes, and number of hospital admissions did not differ significantly between groups. Episodes were less severe in the FF (fermented formula) group. There were fewer cases of dehydration 2.5%versus 6.1% (P = 0.01), fewer medical consultations (46%v 56.6%, P = 0.003), fewer ORS prescriptions 41.9%v 51.9% (P = 0.003) and fewer switches to other formulas (59.5%v 74.9%, P = 0.0001) in FF infants compared to SF. CONCLUSION: A fermented formula may reduce the severity of acute diarrhea among healthy young infants. This outcome may be linked to the bifidogenic effects of fermentation products and their interactions with the intestinal immune system.
TI  - Characterization of mesentericin ST99, a bacteriocin produced by Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum ST99 isolated from boza.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria isolated from Boza, a cereal-fermented beverage from Belogratchik, Bulgaria, were screened for the production of bacteriocins. With the first screening, 13 of the 52 isolates inhibited the growth of Listeria innocua and Lactobacillus plantarum. The cell-free supernatant of one of these strains, classified as Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum ST99, inhibited the growth of Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, several Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Listeria innocua, Listeria monocytogenes, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Clostridium spp., Carnobacterium spp., L. mesenteroides and Gram-negative bacteria were not inhibited. Maximum antimicrobial activity, i.e. 6,400 arbitrary units (AU)/ml, was recorded in MRS broth after 24 h at 30 degrees C. Incubation in the presence of protease IV and pronase E resulted in loss of antimicrobial activity, confirming that growth inhibition was caused by a bacteriocin, designated here as mesentericin ST99. No loss in activity was recorded after treatment with alpha-amylase, SDS, Tween 20, Tween 80, urea, Triton X-100, N-laurylsarcosin, EDTA and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride. Mesentericin ST99 remained active after 30 min at 121 degrees C and after 2 h of incubation at pH 2 to 12. Metabolically active cells of L. innocua treated with mesentericin ST99 did not undergo lysis. Mesentericin ST99 did not adhere to the cell surface of strain ST99. Precipitation with ammonium sulfate (70% saturation), followed by Sep-Pack C18 chromatography and reverse-phase HPLC on a C18 Nucleosil column yielded one antimicrobial peptide.
TI  - Enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and their role on exopolysaccharide production in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The role of the enzymes uridine-5'-diphospho-(UDP) glucose pyrophosphorylase and  UDP galactose 4-epimerase in exopolysaccharide production of Gal- ropy and non-ropy strains of Streptococcus thermophilus in a batch culture was investigated. Growth of the ropy and non-ropy strains was accompanied by total release of the galactose moiety from lactose hydrolysis in modified Bellinker broth with lactose as the only carbon source. This was associated with a greater exopolysaccharide production by the ropy strain. The polymer produced by both strains in cultures with lactose or glucose as carbon sources contained glucose, galactose and rhamnose, indicating that glucose was used as a carbon source for bacterial growth and for exopolysaccharide formation. UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase activity was associated with polysaccharide production during the first 12 h in a 20 h culture in the ropy strain, but not in the non-ropy strain. UDP-galactose 4-epimerase was not associated with exopolysaccharide synthesis in any strain. The evidence presented suggests that the glucose moiety from lactose hydrolysis is the source of sugar for heteropolysaccharide synthesis, due to a high UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase activity.
TI  - Influence of biosurfactants from probiotic bacteria on formation of biofilms on voice prostheses.
AB  - Biofilms were grown on preconditioned voice prostheses with biosurfactants obtained from probiotic bacteria Lactococcus lactis 53 and Streptococcus thermophilus A in an artificial throat model. Both biosurfactants greatly reduced microbial numbers on prostheses and also induced a decrease in the airflow resistance that occurs on voice prostheses after biofilm formation. This study presents a promising strategy for prolonging the lifespan of voice prostheses.
TI  - Ability of thermophilic lactic acid bacteria to produce aroma compounds from amino acids.
AB  - Although a large number of key odorants of Swiss-type cheese result from amino acid catabolism, the amino acid catabolic pathways in the bacteria present in these cheeses are not well known. In this study, we compared the in vitro abilities of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, Lactobacillus helveticus, and Streptococcus thermophilus to produce aroma compounds from three amino acids, leucine, phenylalanine, and methionine, under mid-pH conditions of cheese ripening (pH 5.5), and we investigated the catabolic pathways used by these bacteria. In the three lactic acid bacterial species, amino acid catabolism was initiated by a transamination step, which requires the presence of an alpha-keto acid such as alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG) as the amino group acceptor, and produced alpha-keto acids. Only S. thermophilus exhibited glutamate dehydrogenase activity, which produces alpha-KG from glutamate, and consequently only S. thermophilus was capable of catabolizing amino acids in the reaction medium without alpha-KG addition. In the presence of alpha-KG, lactobacilli produced much more varied aroma compounds such as acids, aldehydes, and alcohols than S. thermophilus, which mainly produced alpha-keto acids and a small amount of hydroxy acids and acids. L. helveticus mainly produced acids from phenylalanine and leucine, while L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis produced larger amounts of alcohols and/or aldehydes. Formation of aldehydes, alcohols, and acids from alpha-keto acids by L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis mainly results from the action of an alpha-keto acid decarboxylase, which produces aldehydes that are then oxidized or reduced to acids or alcohols. In contrast, the enzyme involved in the alpha-keto acid conversion to acids in L. helveticus and S. thermophilus is an alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase that produces acyl coenzymes A.
TI  - Antigenotoxicity of probiotics and prebiotics on faecal water-induced DNA damage  in human colon adenocarcinoma cells.
AB  - Six strains of lactic acid producing bacteria (LAB) were incubated (1 x 10(8)cfu/ml) with genotoxic faecal water from a human subject. HT29 human adenocarcinoma cells were then challenged with the resultant samples and DNA damage measured using the single cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay. The LAB strains investigated were Bifidobacterium sp. 420, Bifidobacterium Bb12, Lactobacillus plantarum, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Enterococcus faecium. DNA damage was significantly decreased by all bacteria used with the exception of Strep. thermophilus. Bif. Bb12 and Lact. plantarum showed the greatest protective effect against DNA damage. Incubation of faecal water with different concentrations of Bif. Bb12 and Lact. plantarum revealed that the decrease in genotoxicity was related to cell density. Non-viable (heat treated) probiotic cells had no effect on faecal water genotoxicity. In a second study, HT29 cells were cultured in the presence of supernatants of incubations of probiotics with various carbohydrates including known prebiotics; the HT29 cells were then exposed to faecal water. Overall, incubations involving Lact. plantarum with the fructooligosaccharide (FOS)-based prebiotics Inulin, Raftiline, Raftilose and Actilight were the most effective in increasing the cellular resistance to faecal water genotoxicity, whereas fermentations with Elixor (a galactooligosaccharide) and Fibersol (a maltodextrin) were less effective. Substantial reductions in faecal water-induced DNA damage were also seen with supernatants from incubation of prebiotics with Bif. Bb12. The supernatant of fermentations involving Ent. faecium and Bif. sp. 420 generally had less potent effects on genotoxicity although some reductions with Raftiline and Elixor fermentations were apparent.
TI  - Effect of the metabolism of urea on the acidifying activity of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - One of the main functions of Streptococcus thermophilus strains used in the dairy industry is the production of lactic acid. In cheese and fermented milk manufacturing processes, the pH evolution kinetics must be reproducible in order to ensure the good quality of the final products. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of the metabolism of urea on the acidifying activity of fast- and slow-acidifying strains of S. thermophilus. Milk treatment with a purified urease and utilization of the urease inhibitor flurofamide revealed that urea metabolism by S. thermophilus influences the pH evolution kinetics through 2 distinct means. First, ammonia production from urea tends to increase the pH. This effect is greater when lactic acid concentration is low due to a lower buffering capacity of milk. Second, urea metabolism also modifies growth and lactic acid production by S. thermophilus. Depending on the strains and the growth stage of the cultures, consumption of urea induces either a faster or a slower pH decrease. For the slow-acidifying strain RD678, suppression of urea metabolism by adding flurofamide decreased the time necessary to reach pH 6 by 195 min. This effect was less pronounced for the 2 fast-acidifying strains RD674 and RD677. These results show that urea metabolism may have a considerable influence on the acidifying properties of S. thermophilus strains.
TI  - Survey of bacterial proteins released in cheese: a proteomic approach.
AB  - During the ripening of Emmental cheese, the bacterial ecosystem confers its organoleptic characteristics to the evolving curd both by the action of the living cells, and through the release of numerous proteins, including various types of enzymes into the cheese when the cells lyse. In Emmental cheese these proteins can be released from thermophilic lactic acid bacteria used as starters like Lactobacillus helveticus, Lb delbruecki subsp. lactis and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and ripening bacteria such as Propionibacterium freudenreichii. The aim of this study was to obtain a proteomic view of the different groups of proteins within the cheese using proteomic tools to create a reference map. A methodology was therefore developed to reduce the complexity of cheese matrix prior to 2D-PAGE analysis. The aqueous phase of cheese was prefractionated by size exclusion chromatography, bacterial and milk proteins were separated and subsequently characterised by mass spectrometry, prior to peptide mass fingerprint and sequence homology database search. Five functional groups of proteins were identified involved in: (i) proteolysis, (ii) glycolysis, (iii) stress response, (iv) DNA and RNA repair and (v) oxidoreduction. The results revealed stress responses triggered by thermophilic lactic acid bacteria and Propionibacterium strains at the end of ripening. Information was also obtained regarding the origin and nature of the peptidases released into the cheese, thus providing a greater understanding of casein degradation mechanisms during ripening. Different peptidases arose from St thermophilus and Lb helveticus, suggesting that streptococci are involved in peptide degradation in addition to the proteolytic activity of lactobacilli.
TI  - Probiotics reduce the CD34+ hemopoietic precursor cell increased traffic in allergic subjects.
AB  - An increased traffic of circulating CD34+ Hemopoietic Precursors Cells (HPC) is an important feature of systemic allergic inflammation. Bacteria and bacterial products are capable of stimulating the transcription of the maturational cytokines IL12 and IFNs through the activation of Toll-Like-Receptor and the subsequent nuclear translocation of the NF-kappaB factor. In this study the probiotics differentiation/maturational effect potential on CD34+ HPC has been investigated. Fourteen consecutive subjects, 9M and 5F, aged 6-48, with clinical symptoms of asthma and /or conjunctivitis, rhinitis, urticaria, atopic dermatitis, food allergy and irritable bowel syndrome were enrolled. Allergen-specific serum IgE were found in twelve patients. Flow-cytometric measurement of peripheral blood CD34dim/bright HPC values were assessed before and after 30 days of therapy, consisting in the oral administration of one sachet a day of ENDOLAC (UCB Pharma, Turin, Italy). Each sachet contained a mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. delbrueckii and Streptococcus thermophilus for a total of 1 x 10(9) live bacteria. Circulating CD34+ cell values significantly (p < 0.001) reduced after the treatment. ENDOLAC, thus, may improve the efficacy of the standard treatments of allergic diseases.
TI  - Temperature step changes: a novel approach to control biofilms of Streptococcus thermophilus in a pilot plant-scale cheese-milk pasteurisation plant.
AB  - A pilot plant-scale cheese-milk pasteurisation plant was designed and constructed to study the development of biofilms of Streptococcus thermophilus during pasteurisation of milk, and to investigate methods for preventing this growth from occurring. Under base run conditions, S. thermophilus grew on surfaces in the cool-down sections of the pilot plant, between 50 and 35 degrees C (bulk milk temperature), and could be detected in the product stream after 8-10 h production, reaching levels of 10(6) CFU ml-1 after 16 h. Thermoduric bacteria also grew in the heating sections of the pilot plant, although to a lesser extent, as did non-thermoduric bacteria that originated in the raw milk. The novel application of temperature step changes, implemented periodically to the growth region of S. thermophilus, successfully controlled the development of biofilms of these organisms. The growth of bacteria on the heating side of the pilot plant was also prevented by the implementation of these same step changes. The optimum step change conditions required to achieve a 20-h production run without detectable growth of S. thermophilus comprised a step change to 55 degrees C, applied for 10 min, with a 60-min interval between step changes.
TI  - Assessment of enzymatic cleaning agents and disinfectants against bacterial biofilms.
AB  - PURPOSE: Microbial biofilm has become difficult to control by antibiotic and biocide regimes that are effective against suspended bacteria. Their colonization of surfaces can be a problem and is generally controlled through cleaning and disinfection. This study was undertaken to examine the efficacy of the disinfectants including Bio-Ow, Econase CE, Gamanase GC 140, IndiAge 44L, Mannanase AMB, Multifect P-3000, Neutrase, Pandion, Paradigm, Pectinex Ultra SP-L, Promozyme, Resinase A2X, Spezyme AA300, Spezyme GA300 and Vinozym EC, and the proteinase against bacterial biofilms. METHODS: The effectiveness of 20 commercial disinfectants against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) biofilms using a fluorometric technique was examined. Additionally the disinfectants were also tested against Lactobacillus bulgaricus (L. bulgaricus), Lactobacillus lactis (L. lactis) and Streptococcus thermophilus (S. thermophilus) isolates using microtitration tray based turbidimetric techniques. Escherichia coli (E. coli) was used as the test bacteria in the fluorometric control method. RESULTS: Among the first group of the enzymatic cleaning agents tested, four disinfectants (Pandion, Resinase A2X, Spezyme GA300 and Paradigm) were the most potent against bacterial biofilms after 30 min incubation time (residual bacterial count less than 10(3) CFU (colony forming units)/ml). However, only Resinase A2X and Paradigm showed a good effect on bacterial biofilms after 15 min incubation time. Proteinase disinfectants (alkalase, chymotrypsin, cryotin and krilltrypsin) from the second group of the disinfectants showed a good effect against P. aeruginosa biofilm when tested in the absence of milk. The performance of the disinfectants was reduced in the presence of milk. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the cleaning agents was determined as the lowest concentration inhibiting bacterial growth. The MIC was tested on Lactobacillus bulgaricus (L. bulgaricus), Lactobacillus lactis (L. lactis) and Streptococcus thermophilus (S. thermophilus) isolates. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for Paradigm against S. thermophilus and L. Lactis were lower than L. Bulgaricus. Whereas, the MIC of Pandion against L. bulgaricus was lower than MIC against L. lactis. Resinase A2X had no inhibitory effect on bacterial growth when the concentration was less than or equal to 2.4 mg/ml and Spezyme GA 300 concentration less than or equal to 7.3 mg/ml. Minimum inhibitory concentration of Pandion against L. bulgaricus was 2.7 microg/ml and against L. lactis 5.3 microg/ml. Growth of S. thermophilus was inhibited in all concentration of Pandion tested. CONCLUSIONS: The choice of disinfectant or cleaning agent along with the optimum concentration and the time of action is very important when destroying microbes. It is also important that the resistances of microbes to different disinfectants and cleaning agents be taken into account when planning the cleaning process
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria secrete metabolites retaining anti-inflammatory properties after intestinal transport.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotic bacteria have a beneficial effect on intestinal inflammation. In this study, we have examined the effect of lactic acid and commensal Gram positive (+) bacteria conditioned media (CM) on tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) release and the mechanisms involved. METHODS: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced TNF-alpha secretion by peripheral blood mononuclear cells or the THP-1 cell line was monitored in the presence or absence of bacteria CM obtained from two probiotic strains, Bifidobacterium breve (Bb) and Streptococcus thermophilus (St), and three commensal bacterial strains (Bifidobacterium bifidum, Ruminococcus gnavus, and unidentified Streptococcus). Bb and St bacteria CM were allowed to cross filter grown intestinal epithelial cell monolayers (HT29-19A) to assess intestinal transport of active bacterial products. These products were characterised and their effect on LPS binding to THP-1 cells and nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappa B) activation assessed. RESULTS: Dose dependent inhibition of LPS induced TNF-alpha secretion was noted for both probiotic bacteria CM (64% and 71% inhibition for Bb and St, respectively) and to a lesser extent commensal bacteria CM (21-32% inhibition). Active products from Bb and St were resistant to digestive enzymes and had a molecular mass <3000 Da. Their inhibitory effect was preserved after transepithelial transport across intestinal cell monolayers, mainly in inflammatory conditions. LPS-FITC binding to THP-1 cells and NF kappa B activation were significantly inhibited by Bb and St CM. CONCLUSION: B breve and S thermophilus release metabolites exerting an anti-TNF-alpha effect capable of crossing the intestinal barrier. Commensal bacteria also display a TNF-alpha inhibitory capacity but to a lesser extent. These results underline the beneficial effect of commensal bacteria in intestinal homeostasis and may explain the role of some probiotic bacteria in alleviating digestive inflammation.
TI  - Viability of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria in fermented soymilk after drying, subsequent rehydration and storage.
AB  - To develop a probiotic dietary adjunct, soymilk fermented with various combinations of lactic acid bacteria (Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus acidophilus) and bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium longum and Bifidobacterium infantis) was subjected to freeze-drying and spray-drying. Survival of the starter organisms during the drying process, subsequent rehydration at different temperatures and during a 4-month period of storage under different storage conditions was examined. After freeze-drying, lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria exhibited a survival percent of 46.2-75.1% and 43.2-51.9%, respectively, higher than that noted after spray-drying. Regardless of the drying condition, S. thermophilus showed a higher percentage of survival than L. acidophilus, while B. longum survived better than B. infantis. Further study with soymilk fermented with S. thermophilus and B. longum revealed that the freeze-dried and spray-dried fermented soymilk rehydrated at 35-50 degrees C and 20 degrees C, respectively, was optimum for the recovery of the starter organisms. Both S. thermophilus and B. longum survived better in the freeze-dried than the spray-dried fermented soymilk during storage. A higher percent of survival was also noted for both the starter organisms when the dried fermented soymilk was stored at 4 degrees C than 25 degrees C. Holding the dried fermented soymilk in the laminated pouch enabled S. thermophilus and B. longum to exhibit a higher percentage of survival than in the deoxidant- and desiccant-containing glass or polyester (PET) bottle. Among all the packaging materials and storage temperatures tested, starter organisms were most stable in the dried fermented soymilk held in laminated pouch and stored at 4 degrees C. Under this storage condition, S. thermophilus and B. longum showed a survival percentage of 51.1% and 68.8%, respectively, in the freeze-dried fermented soymilk after 4 months of storage. Meanwhile, S. thermophilus and B. infantis in the spray-dried fermented soymilk showed a survival percent of 29.5% and 57.7%, respectively.
TI  - Indigenous raw milk microbiota influences the bacterial development in traditional cheese from an alpine natural park.
AB  - Nostrano di Primiero is a 6-month ripened cheese produced from raw milk collected in the Paneveggio-Pale di San Martino Natural Park area in the Italian Dolomites. In summer, this cheese is made using milk collected from two different areas, Passo Rolle and Vanoi, in the Paneveggio Natural Park. During the experiment, the milk from the two areas was separately processed, and cheeses were made in the same cheese factory using the same technological process. The microbiota of raw milk and cheeses of the two areas was isolated and the dominant population was monitored by RAPD analysis and identified by 16S rRNA sequence. The milk of the Passo Rolle area was mainly composed of mesophilic strains, thermophilic Streptococcus thermophilus, and low amounts of enterococci were also found; the milk of the Vanoi area was dominated by mesophilic microbiota mostly Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris and ssp. lactis and Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei. The plating of the natural starter culture revealed the presence of a relevant community of thermophilic cocci and lower amounts of enterococci. The dynamic population analysis showed the importance of the natural starter culture in the first 2 days of cheese ripening in both cheeses. Moreover, the large biodiversity observed in the raw milks was also detected in the cheeses during ripening. The Vanoi cheese was dominated by Enterococcus faecium and Streptococcus macedonicus in the first two days and mesophilic 21 Lb. paracasei ssp. paracasei became the most represented population after 15 days of ripening. In the first few days, the Rolle cheese was characterized by being mainly composed of thermophilic S. macedonicus and S. thermophilus and secondarily by mesophilic cocci. During ripening, the microbiota composition changed, and at 15 days, mesophilic lactobacilli were the dominant population, but later, this was mainly composed of mesophilic cocci and lactobacilli. The taxonomical identification by 16S rRNA sequence confirmed a large biodiversity related to raw milk microbiota and only five strains of S. macedonicus, Lactobacillus plantarum, 21 Lb. paracasei ssp. paracasei, Lactobacillus fermentum and E. faecium were detected in both cheeses.
TI  - Probiotics enhance recovery from malnutrition and lessen colonic mucosal atrophy  after short-term fasting in rats.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effects of probiotics on nutritional status and gut mucosal atrophy after fasting. METHODS: Twelve rats were fasted for 3 d and then fed with rat chow (control group, n = 6) or an isoenergetic and isonitrogenous diet containing probiotics (probiotics group, n = 6; 10(6) colony-forming units/g of Bifidobacterium lactis BL and Streptococcus thermophilus) for 3 d. Twelve other rats were starved for 3 d (starved group) or normally fed with rat chow (sham group). At the end of the experiment, blood samples were collected for total protein and albumin analyses, and the colonic mucosa was weighed (in grams) and assayed for DNA content (milligrams per gram of tissue). RESULTS: Feeding efficiency was greater in the probiotic group than in the control and sham groups (P < 0.01). Animals in the probiotic group presented higher albumin than did those in the control group (P = 0.04). Colonic mucosa of the sham group (1.32 [range, 1.28-1.44]) was heavier than that of all other groups (probiotic, 1.20 [0.95-1.49], P = 0.03; control, 1.09 [0.96-1.21], P < 0.01; and starved, 1.03 [0.99-1.07], P < 0.01) and heavier in the probiotic than in the starved group (P = 0.03). The DNA content in probiotic rats (49.1 +/- 9.7) was similar to that in sham rats (53.9 +/- 5.9; P = 0.79) and higher than that in control (30.3 +/- 12.9; P = 0.01) and starved (34.4 +/- 6.5; P = 0.05) rats. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics enhance the recovery of nutritional status and lessen gut mucosal atrophy after fasting.
TI  - Isolation of a minireplicon of the virulence plasmid pXO2 of Bacillus anthracis and characterization of the plasmid-encoded RepS replication protein.
AB  - A minireplicon of plasmid pXO2 of Bacillus anthracis was isolated by molecular cloning in Escherichia coli and shown to replicate in B. anthracis, Bacillus cereus, and Bacillus subtilis. The pXO2 replicon included (i) an open reading frame encoding the putative RepS replication initiation protein and (ii) the putative origin of replication. The RepS protein was expressed as a fusion with the maltose binding protein (MBP) at its amino-terminal end and purified by affinity chromatography. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that the purified MBP-RepS protein bound specifically to a 60-bp region corresponding to the putative origin of replication of pXO2 located immediately downstream of the RepS open reading frame. Competition DNA binding experiments showed that the 5' and central regions of the putative origin were important for RepS binding. MBP-RepS also bound nonspecifically to single-stranded DNA with a lower affinity.
TI  - Evolution of genomic islands by deletion and tandem accretion by site-specific recombination: ICESt1-related elements from Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The 34 734-bp integrative and potentially conjugative element (putative ICE) ICESt1 has been previously found to be site-specifically integrated in the 3' end of the fda locus of Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ368. Four types of genomic islands related to ICESt1 are integrated in the same position in seven other strains of S. thermophilus. One of these elements, ICESt3, harbours conjugation and recombination modules closely related to those of ICESt1 and excises by site-specific recombination. Two other types of elements, CIME19258 and CIME302, are flanked by site-specific attachment sites closely related to attL and attR of ICESt1 and ICESt3, whereas Delta CIME308 only possesses a putative attR site; none of these three elements carry complete conjugation and recombination modules. ICESt1 contains a functional internal recombination site, attL', that is almost identical to attL of CIME19258. The recombination between attL' and attR of ICESt1 leads to the excision of the expected circular molecule (putative ICE); a cis-mobilizable element (CIME) flanked by an attL site and an attB' site remains integrated into the 3' end of fda. Furthermore, sequences that could be truncated att sites were found within ICESt1, ICESt3 and CIME302. All together, these data suggest that these genomic islands evolved by deletion and tandem accretion of ICEs and CIMEs resulting from site-specific recombination. A model for this evolution is proposed and its application to other genomic islands is discussed.
TI  - Microstructure and rheology of an acid-coagulated cheese (Karish) made with an exopolysaccharide-producing Streptococcus thermophilus strain and its exopolysaccharide non-producing genetic variant.
AB  - The objective of this research was to determine the effect of exopolysaccharide (EPS) production by lactic acid bacteria on the microstructure and rheology of Karish cheese, a soft acid coagulated cheese made using skim milk. An EPS-producing strain of Streptococcus thermophilus, and its EPS non-producing genetic variant were used to make comparable batches of the cheese. EPS in cheese was visualized by cryo-SEM as a large, dense, filamentous mass. Cheese made with the EPS non-producing culture was characterized by a dense protein network with smaller pores compared to that prepared with the EPS-producing culture. High elastic and viscous moduli measured by dynamic rheology were observed for EPS negative cheese and was attributed to its dense protein network. Creep test experiments demonstrated that cheese prepared with the EPS non-producing strain was more rigid and recovered its deformation, while cheese made using the EPS producing culture was more deformable. These results indicate that EPS-producing cultures can improve the physical properties of Karish cheese by reducing undesirable rigidity.
TI  - Identification of Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ368 genes involved in defense against superoxide stress.
AB  - To better understand the defense mechanism of Streptococcus thermophilus against  superoxide stress, molecular analysis of 10 menadione-sensitive mutants, obtained by insertional mutagenesis, was undertaken. This analysis allowed the identification of 10 genes that, with respect to their putative functions, were classified into five categories: (i) those involved in cell wall metabolism, (ii) those involved in exopolysaccharide translocation, (iii) those involved in RNA modification, (iv) those involved in iron homeostasis, and (v) those whose functions are still unknown. The behavior of the 10 menadione-sensitive mutants exposed to heat shock was investigated. Data from these experiments allowed us to distinguish genes whose action might be specific to oxidative stress defense (tgt, ossF, and ossG) from those whose action may be generalized to other stressful conditions (mreD, rodA, pbp2b, cpsX, and iscU). Among the mutants, two harbored an independently inserted copy of pGh9:ISS1 in two loci close to each other. More precisely, these two loci are homologous to the sufD and iscU genes, which are involved in the biosynthesis of iron-sulfur clusters. This region, called the suf region, was further characterized in S. thermophilus CNRZ368 by sequencing and by construction of DeltasufD and iscU(97) nonpolar mutants. The streptonigrin sensitivity levels of both mutants suggest that these two genes are involved in iron metabolism.
TI  - Sugar utilisation and conservation of the gal-lac gene cluster in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The adaptation to utilise lactose as primary carbon and energy source is a characteristic for Streptococcus thermophilus. These organisms, however only utilise the glucose moiety of lactose while the galactose moiety is excreted into the growth medium. In this study we evaluated the diversity of sugar utilisation and the conservation of the gal-lac gene cluster in a collection of 18 S. thermophilus strains isolated from a variety of sources. For this purpose analysis was performed on DNA from these isolates and the results were compared with those obtained with a strain from which the complete genome sequence has been determined. The sequence, organisation and flanking regions of the S. thermophilus gal-lac gene cluster were found to be highly conserved among all strains. The vast majority of the S. thermophilus strains were able to utilize only glucose, lactose, and sucrose as carbon sources, some strains could also utilize fructose and two of these were able to grow on galactose. Molecular characterisation of these naturally occurring Gal+ strains revealed up-mutations in the galKTE promoter that were absent in all other strains. These data support the hypothesis that the loss of the ability to ferment galactose can be attributed to the low activity of the galKTE promoter, probably as a consequence of the adaptation to milk in which the lactose levels are in excess.
TI  - Site-directed mutagenesis of the hinge region of nisinZ and properties of nisinZ  mutants.
AB  - To study the role of the hinge region in nisin and to obtain mutants that exhibit altered or new biological activities and functional properties, we changed certain amino acids in the hinge region by performing site-directed mutagenesis with the nisinZ structural gene ( nisZ). The results showed that the nisinZ mutants had decreased antimicrobial activities against Micrococcus flavus NCIB8166 and Streptococcus thermophilus. Interestingly, compared with wild nisinZ, mutant N20K nisinZ and M21K nisinZ displayed antimicrobial activity against gram-negative Shigella, Pseudomonas and Salmonella; and they had a higher solubility than wild-type nisinZ. At pH 8, the solubilities of N20K nisinZ and M21K nisinZ were, respectively, three-fold higher and five-fold higher than that of nisinZ. Mutant N20Q nisinZ and M21G nisinZ were considerably more stable than nisinZ at higher temperatures and neutral or alkaline pH. These mutants provided information that the central hinge region in nisinZ plays an important role in providing the conformational flexibility required for the antimicrobial activity on the membrane. Our finding documented that it may well be worth considering the construction of the new nisin mutants with changed inhibitory activity against a wide range of gram-negative bacteria and the improvement of functional properties by site-directed mutagenesis.
TI  - Identification of an iron-binding protein of the Dps family expressed by Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus PB18 can grow between 20 degrees and 52 degrees C and  is resistant to various stresses such as heat, acidic or cold shock. During cold shock, a protein of 21.5 kDa was previously shown to be induced in S. thermophilus. In addition to its cold-shock induction, 2D-PAGE revealed that the 21.5-kDa protein was also expressed during the stationary phase of growth. The recent access to the genome sequence of S. thermophilus LMG18311 allowed the identification of a 173-amino acid protein displaying a strong homology between the 21.5-kDa protein and members of the Dps family of proteins. Specific staining of non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (ND-PAGE) followed by two-dimensional PAGE (2D-PAGE) showed that the 21.5-kDa protein was an iron-binding protein.
TI  - Improvement of carotenoid-synthesizing yeast Rhodotorula rubra by chemical mutagenesis.
AB  - A mutant Rhodotorula rubra with enhanced carotenoid-synthesizing activity for synthesizing total carotenoids and beta-carotene was obtained by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine mutagenesis. When co-cultivated with yogurt starter bacteria (Lactobacillus bulgaricus + Streptococcus thermophilus) in whey ultrafiltrate it produced 15.7 mg total carotenoids l(-1) culture fluid or 946 microg total carotenoids g(-1) dry cells of which 71% was beta-carotene. Grown as a monoculture in glucose substrate, the mutant shown 1.4 times lower carotenoid-synthesizing activity, and the relative share of beta-carotene in the total carotenoids was lower (63%). The individual pigments torulene and torularhodin were identified, whose mass fractions were (29% and 7%) and (24% and 4%), respectively, for the mutant grown as a monoculture and as a mixed culture with the yogurt bacteria.
TI  - The prophages of Lactobacillus johnsonii NCC 533: comparative genomics and transcription analysis.
AB  - Two non-inducible, but apparently complete prophages were identified in the genome of the sequenced Lactobacillus johnsonii strain NCC 533. The 38- and 40-kb-long prophages Lj928 and Lj965 represent distinct lineages of Sfi11-like pac-site Siphoviridae unrelated at the DNA sequence level. The deduced structural proteins from Lj928 demonstrated aa sequence identity with Lactococcus lactis phage TP901-1, while Lj965 shared sequence links with Streptococcus thermophilus phage O1205. With the exception of tRNA genes, inserted between DNA replication and DNA packaging genes, the transcription of the prophage was restricted to the genome segments near both attachment sites. Transcribed genes unrelated to phage functions were inserted between the phage repressor and integrase genes; one group of genes shared sequence relatedness with a mobile DNA element in Staphylococcus aureus. A short, but highly transcribed region was located between the phage lysin and right attachment site; it lacked a protein-encoding function in one prophage.
TI  - ThyA as a selection marker in construction of food-grade host-vector and integration systems for Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - We constructed food-grade host-vector and integration systems for Streptococcus thermophilus by using a thymidylate synthase gene (thyA) as the selection marker. Two thyA genes, thyA(St) and thyA(Lb), were cloned from S. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, respectively. Thymidine-requiring mutants of S. thermophilus were obtained after successive cultures in the presence of trimethoprim, and one of them, TM1-1, was used as the host. Food-grade vectors were constructed by using either thyA(St) or thyA(Lb) as the selection marker. Transformants of TM1-1 created by using these vectors were selected for thymidine autotrophy as efficiently as for erythromycin resistance. By using the host-vector system developed in this way, a foreign amylase gene (amyA) was expressed in TM1-1 and was also integrated into the chromosome by use of a temperature-sensitive integration vector constructed with thyA(Lb) as the selection marker via a double-crossover event. The results obtained show that thyA is an efficient and safe selection marker for S. thermophilus that is suitable for food applications.
TI  - Antisense RNA targeting of primase interferes with bacteriophage replication in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The putative primase gene and other genes associated with the Sfi21-prototype genome replication module are highly conserved in Streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophages. Expression of antisense RNAs complementary to the putative primase gene (pri3.1) from S. thermophilus phage kappa 3 provided significant protection from kappa 3 and two other Sfi21-type phages. Expression of pri3.10-AS, an antisense RNA that covered the entire primase gene, reduced the efficiency of plaquing (EOP) of kappa 3 to 3 x 10(-3) and reduced its burst size by 20%. Mutant phages capable of overcoming antisense inhibition were not recovered. Thirteen primase-specific antisense cassettes of different lengths (478 to 1,512 bp) were systematically designed to target various regions of the gene. Each cassette conferred some effect, reducing the EOP to between 0.8 and 3 x 10(-3). The largest antisense RNAs (1.5 kb) were generally found to confer the greatest reductions in EOP, but shorter (0.5 kb) antisense RNAs were also effective, especially when directed to the 5' region of the gene. The impacts of primase-targeted antisense RNAs on phage development were examined. The expression of pri3.10-AS resulted in reductions in target RNA abundance and the number of phage genomes synthesized. Targeting a key genome replication function with antisense RNA provided effective phage protection in S. thermophilus.
TI  - Synthesis of carotenoids by Rhodotorula rubra GED8 co-cultured with yogurt starter cultures in whey ultrafiltrate.
AB  - Two cultures, a yeast ( Rhodorula rubra GED8) and a yogurt starter ( Lactobacillus bulgaricus 2-11+ Streptococcus thermophilus 15HA), were selected for associated growth in whey ultrafiltrate (WU) and active synthesis of carotenoids. In associated cultivation with the yogurt culture L bulgaricus 2-11+S. thermophilus 15HA under intensive aeration (1.3 l(-1)min(-1) air-flow rate) in WU (45 g lactose l(-1)), initial pH 5.5, 30 degrees C, the lactose-negative strain R. rubra GED8 synthesized large amounts of carotenoids (13.09 mg l(-1 )culture fluid). The carotenoid yield was approximately two-fold higher in association with a mixed yogurt culture than in association with pure yogurt bacteria. The major carotenoid pigments comprising the total carotenoids were beta-carotene (50%), torulene (12.3%) and torularhodin (35.2%). Carotenoids with a high beta-carotene content were produced by the microbial association 36 h earlier than by Rhodotorula yeast species. No significant differences were notd in the ratio between the pigments synthesized by R. rubra GED8+ L. bulgaricus 2-11, R. rubra GED8+ S. thermophilus 15HA, and R.rubra GED8+yogurt culture, despite the fact that the total carotenoid concentrations were lower in the mixed cultures with pure yogurt bacteria.
TI  - Changes in galactose and lactic acid content of sweet whey during storage.
AB  - Whey is often stored or transported for a period of time prior to processing. During this time period, galactose and lactic acid concentrations may accumulate, reducing the quality of spray-dried whey powders in regard to stickiness and agglomeration. This study surveyed industry samples of Cheddar and mozzarella cheese whey streams to determine how galactose and lactic acid concentrations changed with storage at appropriate (4 degrees C) and abuse (37.8 degrees C) temperatures. Samples stored at 4 degrees C did not exhibit significant increases in levels of lactic acid or galactose. Mozzarella whey accumulated the greatest amount of galactose and lactic acid with storage at 37.8 degrees C. Whey samples derived from cheese made from single strains of starter culture were also evaluated to determine each culture's contribution to galactose and lactic acid production. Starter cultures evaluated included Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris, and Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. Whey derived from L. helveticus accumulated a significantly greater amount of lactic acid upon storage at 37.8 degrees C as compared with the other cultures. Galactose accumulation was significantly decreased in whey from L. lactis ssp. lactis stored at 37.8 degrees C in comparison with the other cultures. Results from this study indicate that proper storage conditions (4 degrees C) for whey prevent accumulation of galactose and lactic acid while the extent of accumulation during storage at 37.8 degrees C varies depending on the culture(s) used in cheese production.
TI  - Evaluation of bacterial communities belonging to natural whey starters for Grana  Padano cheese by length heterogeneity-PCR.
AB  - AIMS: To detect bacteria present in controlled dairy ecosystems with defined composition by length-heterogeneity (LH)-PCR. LH-PCR allows to distinguish different organisms on the basis of natural variations in the length of 16S rRNA gene sequences. METHODS AND RESULTS: LH-PCR was applied to depict population structure of the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) species recoverable from Grana Padano cheese whey starters. Typical bacterial species present in the LAB community were evidenced and well discriminated. Small differences in species composition, e.g. the frequent finding of Streptococcus thermophilus and the constant presence of thermophilic lactobacilli (Lactobacillus helveticus, Lact. delbrueckii subsp. lactis/bulgaricus and Lact. fermentum) were reliably highlighted. Specificity of LH-PCR was confirmed by species-specific PCR from total DNA of the cultures. CONCLUSIONS: LH-PCR is a useful tool to monitor microbial composition and population dynamics in dairy starter cultures. When present, non-dominant bacterial species present in the whey starters, such as Strep. thermophilus, can easily be visualized and characterized without isolating and cultivating single strains. A similar approach can be applied to more complex dairy ecosystems such as milk or cheese curd. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Community members and differences in population structure of controlled dairy ecosystems such as whey starters for hard cheeses can be evaluated and compared in a relative easy, fast, reliable and highly reproducible way.
TI  - Two distinct pathways for the formation of hydroxy FA from linoleic acid by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Twenty-three of 86 strains of lactic acid bacteria transformed linoleic acid into hydroxy FA. Two distinct conversion pathways were in operation. Two strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus and a strain of Pediococcus pentosaceus produced 13(S)-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid 113(S)-OH 18:11 and 10,13dihydroxyoctadecanoic acid (10,13-OH 18:0) as main and minor products, respectively, whereas 13 strains, including L. casei subsp. casei, L. paracasei subsp. paracasei, L. rhamnosus, L. lactis subsp. cremoris, and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus produced 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid (10-OH 18:1). Seven strains of L. plantarum converted linoleic acid to 10-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid (10-OH 18:0) through 10-OH 18:1. Linoleic acid at 2 g/L was converted by L. acidophilus IFO13951T to 1.3 g of 13(S)-OH 18:1 and 0.09 g of 10,13-OH 18:0 in 7 d. Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei JCM 1111 produced 10-OH 18:1 in 91% yield, and L. plantarum JCM 8341, 10-OH 18:0 in 59% yield from linoleic acid (2 g/L) under optimal conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the production of 13(S)-OH 18:1 by lactic acid bacteria other than ruminal bacteria, and of 10,13-OH 18:0 by any bacteria.
TI  - Biodiversity of exopolysaccharides produced by Streptococcus thermophilus strains is reflected in their production and their molecular and functional characteristics.
AB  - Twenty-six lactic acid bacterium strains isolated from European dairy products were identified as Streptococcus thermophilus and characterized by bacterial growth and exopolysaccharide (EPS)-producing capacity in milk and enriched milk medium. In addition, the acidification rates of the different strains were compared with their milk clotting behaviors. The majority of the strains grew better when yeast extract and peptone were added to the milk medium, although the presence of interfering glucomannans was shown, making this medium unsuitable for EPS screening. EPS production was found to be strain dependent, with the majority of the strains producing between 20 and 100 mg of polymer dry mass per liter of fermented milk medium. Furthermore, no straightforward relationship between the apparent viscosity and EPS production could be detected in fermented milk medium. An analysis of the molecular masses of the isolated EPS by gel permeation chromatography revealed a large variety, ranging from 10 to >2,000 kDa. A distinction could be made between high-molecular-mass EPS (>1,000 kDa) and low-molecular-mass EPS (<1,000 kDa). Based on the molecular size of the EPS, three groups of EPS-producing strains were distinguished. Monomer analysis of the EPS by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with amperometric detection was demonstrated to be a fast and simple method. All of the EPS from the S. thermophilus strains tested were classified into six groups according to their monomer compositions. Apart from galactose and glucose, other monomers, such as (N-acetyl)galactosamine, (N-acetyl)glucosamine, and rhamnose, were also found as repeating unit constituents. Three strains were found to produce EPS containing (N-acetyl)glucosamine, which to our knowledge was never found before in an EPS from S. thermophilus. Furthermore, within each group, differences in monomer ratios were observed, indicating possible novel EPS structures. Finally, large differences between the consistencies of EPS solutions from five different strains were assigned to differences in their molecular masses and structures.
TI  - Long-term consumption of infant formulas containing live probiotic bacteria: tolerance and safety.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nonpathogenic live bacteria are consumed as food by many children, particularly in the form of yogurt. The tolerance and safety of long-term consumption of specific types and strains of probiotic bacteria are not well documented. OBJECTIVE: The goal was to evaluate tolerance to formulas containing 2 levels of probiotic supplementation and effects on growth, general clinical status, and intestinal health in free-living healthy infants. DESIGN: This was a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of healthy infants aged 3-24 mo. Infants were assigned to receive a standard milk-based formula containing 1 x 10(7) colony-forming units (CFU)/g each of Bifidobacterium lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus, formula containing 1 x 10(6) CFU/g each of B. lactis and S. thermophilus, or unsupplemented formula. Clinical outcomes included formula intake, gastrointestinal tolerance, anthropometric measures, daycare attendance, and history of illness. RESULTS: One hundred eighteen infants aged ( +/- SD) 7.0 +/- 2.9 mo at enrollment consumed formula for 210 +/- 127 d. There were no significant differences in age, sex, formula consumption, or length of study between groups. The supplemented formulas were well accepted and were associated with a lower frequency of reported colic or irritability (P < 0.001) and a lower frequency of antibiotic use (P < 0.001) than was the unsupplemented formula. There were no significant differences between groups in growth, health care attention seeking, daycare absenteeism, or other health variables. CONCLUSION: Long-term consumption of formulas supplemented with B. lactis and S. thermophilus was well tolerated and safe and resulted in adequate growth, reduced reporting of colic or irritability, and a lower frequency of antibiotic use.
TI  - Randomised clinical trial of synbiotic therapy in elective surgical patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is possible to manipulate the composition of the gastrointestinal  microflora by administration of pre- and probiotics. This may help to preserve gut barrier function and reduce the incidence of septic morbidity. AIMS: To assess the effects of a combination of pre- and probiotics (synbiotic) on bacterial translocation, gastric colonisation, systemic inflammation, and septic morbidity in elective surgical patients. PATIENTS: Patients were enrolled two weeks prior to elective abdominal surgery. Seventy two patients were randomised to the synbiotic group and 65 to the placebo group. Patients were well matched regarding age and sex distribution, diagnoses, and POSSUM scores. METHODS: Patients in the synbiotic group received a two week preoperative course of Lactobacillus acidophilus La5, Bifidobacterium lactis Bb-12, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Lactobacillus bulgaricus, together with the prebiotic oligofructose. Patients in the placebo group received placebo capsules and sucrose powder. At surgery, a nasogastric aspirate, mesenteric lymph node, and scrapings of the terminal ileum were harvested for microbiological analysis. Serum was collected preoperatively and on postoperative days 1 and 7 for measurement of C reactive protein, interleukin 6, and antiendotoxin antibodies. Septic morbidity and mortality were recorded. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the synbiotic and control groups in bacterial translocation (12.1% v 10.7%; p = 0.808, chi(2)), gastric colonisation (41% v 44%; p = 0.719), systemic inflammation, or septic complications (32% v 31%; p = 0.882). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, synbiotics had no measurable effect on gut barrier function in elective surgical patients. Further studies investigating the place of pre- and probiotics in clinical practice are required.
TI  - Characterization of a theta-replicating plasmid from Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Plasmids of Streptococcus thermophilus were previously classified, based on DNA homology, into at least four groups (A-D). Here, we report the characterization of plasmids of group B and D. The sequence analysis of pSMQ173b (group D) indicates that this plasmid contains 4449 bp, five open reading frames (ORFs) and replicates via the rolling-circle mechanism of the pGI3 family. The plasmid pSMQ308 (group B) contains 8144 bp and six ORFs. Two ORFs likely encode a primase/helicase and an integrase. Northern blot experiments demonstrate that these two orfs are transcribed within the three strains containing plasmids of group B. Two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis shows that pSMQ308 replicates via a theta mechanism. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a plasmid replicating via a theta mode in S. thermophilus. Finally, a classification of 20 sequenced S. thermophilus plasmids into six groups based on their mode of replication is proposed.
TI  - Development of a new method, based on a bioreactor coupled with an L-lactate biosensor, toward the determination of a nonspecific inhibition of L-lactic acid production during milk fermentation.
AB  - The development and characteristics of a bioreactor employing bacteria (Streptococcus thermophilus) encapsulated in Ca-alginate beads coupled with an L-lactate biosensor are reported. The biosensor comprises a carbon paste electrode modified with enzymes HRP (horseradish peroxidase), LOD (lactate oxidase), and FcH (ferrocene) as redox mediator. The measurement of L-lactate is based on the signal produced by H(2)O(2), the product of the enzymatic oxidation of L-lactate by LOD. The detection of H(2)O(2) is performed at the electrode surface via HRP/FcH at low operating potential (-100mV vs Ag/AgCl). Optimization studies were performed using the bioreactor in conjunction with an L-lactate electrode operating in a flow injection system to assess the ability of encapsulated bacteria to ferment carbohydrate solutions. The possibility of using the developed method to assess the fermentation capability of milk samples was evaluated. Bronopol (2-bromo-2-nitro propane-1,3-diol) was chosen to simulate the effect of an inhibitory agent of milk fermentation. The obtained results indicated that the evaluation of the amount of L-lactate amount produced through the bioreactor could be used as a measure of inhibition of lactic acid production in milk samples.
TI  - Effect of the lactic acid bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus on stratum corneum ceramide levels and signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis patients.
AB  - A reduced amount of total ceramides could be responsible for functional abnormalities of the skin of atopic dermatitis (AD) patients. The ability of an experimental cream containing sonicated Streptococcus thermophilus to increase skin ceramide levels in healthy subjects has been previously reported. The aim of the present work was to investigate the effects of the topical administration of a S. thermophilus-containing cream on ceramide levels of stratum corneum from AD patients. A 2-week application of the cream, containing a sonicated preparation of the lactic acid bacterium S. thermophilus, in the forearm skin of 11 patients led to a significant and relevant increase of skin ceramide amounts, which could have resulted from the sphingomyelin hydrolysis through the bacterial sphingomyelinase. Moreover, in all patients the topical application of our experimental cream also resulted in the improvement of the signs and symptoms characteristic of AD skin (i.e. erythema, scaling, pruritus).
TI  - Characterization of urease genes cluster of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - AIMS: The milk acidification rate of Streptococcus thermophilus strains can be affected by several factors, one of which is the hydrolysis of urea by the urease complex. To evaluate the technological suitability of S. thermophilus strains deprived of urease activity in milk fermentation, the genetic cluster related to urease enzymatic activity has been characterized in the type strain DSM 20167T. METHODS AND RESULTS: Amplification of the urease genes of S. thermophilus DSM 20167T was developed on the basis of the urease gene cluster of the phylogenetically related S. salivarius. Nucleotide sequencing revealed the presence of eight open reading frames, which were most homologous to ureABC (structural genes) and ureI, ureEFGD (accessory genes) of S. salivarius and other ureolytic bacteria. Reverse transcriptase PCR experiments were in agreement with an operon organization for the eight genes (ureIABCEFGD). A food grade mutant A16 (DeltaureC3) with a 693 bp in-frame deletion in ureC gene exhibited a urease negative (Ure-) phenotype. Unlike the wild-type strain, the acidification rate of the mutant in reconstituted skimmed milk was not affected by the presence of urea or nickel ions. A small-scale yoghurt fermentation trials were carried out using the wild-type or the Ure- mutant A16 (DeltaureC3) in co-culture with Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus ATCC 11842 in presence of urea. The result obtained underlines that when the Ure- mutant was used as a co-starter the acidification rate was higher than that obtained using the wild-type strain. CONCLUSIONS: The study provides the first genetic characterization and the technological implication of S. thermophilus DSM 20617T urease activity. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The detrimental effect of ureolytic activity on the rate of milk acidification was evaluated and superseded using a food-grade Ure- recombinant strain. Small-scale yoghurt production trials highlighted the positive role of a Ure-S. thermophilus mutant as a co-starter in milk fermentations. Moreover, the vector pMI108 developed for the construction of the Ure- strain, should be considered as a potential tool for the generation of Ure- dairy S. thermophilus strains selected for other relevant technological properties but characterized by the undesirable ureolytic phenotype.
TI  - Effects of pH, temperature, supplementation with whey protein concentrate, and adjunct cultures on the production of exopolysaccharides by Streptococcus thermophilus 1275.
AB  - Effects of pH, temperature, supplementation with whey protein concentrate (WPC),  and non-EPS culture on the exopolysaccharide (EPS) production by Streptococcus thermophilus 1275 were studied. The organism was grown in 10% reconstituted skim milk (RSM) in a Biostat B fermenter for 24 h at various pH (4.5, 5.5 and 6.5) and temperatures (30, 37, 40, and 42 degrees C), and supplementation with WPC 392, and non-EPS producing S. thermophilus 1303 and the amount of EPS produced were determined. Bacterial counts were enumerated and the concentrations of lactic acid, lactose, glucose, and galactose were also determined. A maximum of 406 mg/L of EPS was produced in RSM at 37 degrees C after 24 h of fermentation at pH 4.08 when the pH was not controlled. A pH of 5.5 and temperature of 40 degrees C were found to be optimal for EPS production by S. thermophilus 1275, yielding 458 mg/L. The EPS production increased when RSM was supplemented with WPC 392. At optimum pH and at 37 degrees C with WPC supplementation, the level of EPS increased to 1029 mg/L. Co-culturing S. thermophilus 1275 with non-EPS S. thermophilus 1303 increased EPS production at 37 degrees C and pH 5.5 to 832 mg/L. High temperature (42 degrees C) reduced the amount of EPS production, and EPS production ceased at pH 4.5 when maintained constantly at this pH. The level of lactose utilization and lactic acid production depended on growth conditions of the organism. No glucose was detected, while galactose was found to accumulate in the medium.
TI  - Microbiological characterization of artisanal Montasio cheese: analysis of its indigenous lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the dynamics of the microflora during Montasio cheese ripening, with specific reference to some characteristics of biotechnological interest. Nine batches of Montasio cheese produced in different plants were analyzed. Streptococcus thermophilus was the predominant species throughout the whole ripening period of Montasio cheese. Enterococci were also frequently present. This microbial group resulted probably from milk, and its proportion decreased rapidly during ripening. The most acidifying microbial species was S. thermophilus, while the most proteolytic strains belonged to the genera Enterococcus. A high degree of phenotypic diversity occurred within the microbial species.
TI  - Rapid selection of phage-resistant mutants in Streptococcus thermophilus by immunoselection and cell sorting.
AB  - Immunoselection and flow cytometry allowed the isolation from Streptococcus thermophilus strain Str31 of double mutants displaying resistance to the phage phi31 and good acid production. Strain Str31 is very sensitive to phage phi31. This phage-host system seemed therefore particularly suitable to test the validity of the selection method adopted in this study. Mutants were stable with respect to both characters. The isolation of the double mutants required 4 to 5 days. The approach does not involve genetic manipulations and can therefore be an alternative to genetic engineering when this technology cannot be applied.
TI  - Molecular characterization and functional analysis of the manganese-containing superoxide dismutase gene (sodA) from Streptococcus thermophilus AO54.
AB  - This report describes the isolation, sequencing, and functional analysis of the sodA gene, encoding Mn-superoxide dismutase, from Streptococcus thermophilus AO54. The gene was found to encode a 201 amino acid polypeptide with 88 and 83% identity to SodA from Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus agalacticae, respectively. Primer extension analysis revealed a transcriptional start site 27 nucleotides upstream of initiation codon. The gene was expressed in Escherichia coli and was able to rescue the growth of a sodAsodB mutant in a minimal-medium containing 10(-6)M paraquat. A sodA mutant of S. thermophilus was constructed and found to be more sensitive to aerobic growth than its parent strain. Supplementing the medium with MnCl(2) improved the growth of the mutant, only under microaerophilic conditions. The results suggest that sodA is essential for the aerobic growth of S. thermophilus. In the absence of functional SodA, manganese ions may provide partial protection against oxygen toxicity.
TI  - Identification and characterization of the nickel uptake system for urease biogenesis in Streptococcus salivarius 57.I.
AB  - Ureases are multisubunit enzymes requiring Ni(2+) for activity. The low pH-inducible urease gene cluster in Streptococcus salivarius 57.I is organized as an operon, beginning with ureI, followed by ureABC (structural genes), and ureEFGD (accessory genes). Urease biogenesis also requires a high-affinity Ni(2+) uptake system. By searching the partial genome sequence of a closely related organism, Streptococcus thermophilus LMG18311, three open reading frame (ORFs) homologous to those encoding proteins involved in cobalamin biosynthesis and cobalt transport (cbiMQO) were identified immediately 3' to the ure operon. To determine whether these genes were involved in urease biogenesis by catalyzing Ni(2+) uptake in S. salivarius, regions 3' to ureD were amplified by PCRs from S. salivarius by using primers identical to the S. thermophilus sequences. Sequence analysis of the products revealed three ORFs. Reverse transcriptase PCR was used to demonstrate that the ORFs are transcribed as part of the ure operon. Insertional inactivation of ORF1 with a polar kanamycin marker completely abolished urease activity and the ability to accumulate (63)Ni(2+) during growth. Supplementation of the growth medium with NiCl(2) at concentrations as low as 2.5 micro M partially restored urease activity in the mutant. Both wild-type and mutant strains showed enhanced urease activity when exogenous Ni(2+) was provided at neutral pH. Enhancement of urease activity by adding nickel was regulated at the posttranslational level. Thus, ORF1, ORF2, and ORF3 are part of the ure operon, and these genes, designated ureM, ureQ, and ureO, respectively, likely encode a Ni(2+)-specific ATP-binding cassette transporter.
TI  - Phosphorylation of Streptococcus salivarius lactose permease (LacS) by HPr(His ~  P) and HPr(Ser-P)(His ~ P) and effects on growth.
AB  - The oral bacterium Streptococcus salivarius takes up lactose via a transporter called LacS that shares 95% identity with the LacS from Streptococcus thermophilus, a phylogenetically closely related organism. S. thermophilus releases galactose into the medium during growth on lactose. Expulsion of galactose is mediated via LacS and stimulated by phosphorylation of the transporter by HPr(His approximately P), a phosphocarrier of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase transport system (PTS). Unlike S. thermophilus, S. salivarius grew on lactose without expelling galactose and took up galactose and lactose concomitantly when it is grown in a medium containing both sugars. Analysis of the C-terminal end of S. salivarius LacS revealed a IIA-like domain (IIA(LacS)) almost identical to the IIA domain of S. thermophilus LacS. Experiments performed with purified proteins showed that S. salivarius IIA(LacS) was reversibly phosphorylated on a histidine residue at position 552 not only by HPr(His approximately P) but also by HPr(Ser-P)(His approximately P), a doubly phosphorylated form of HPr present in large amounts in rapidly growing S. salivarius cells. Two other major S. salivarius PTS proteins, IIAB(L)(Man) and IIAB(H)(Man), were unable to phosphorylate IIA(LacS). The effect of LacS phosphorylation on growth was studied with strain G71, an S. salivarius enzyme I-negative mutant that cannot synthesize HPr(His approximately P) or HPr(Ser-P)(His approximately P). These results indicated that (i) the wild-type and mutant strains had identical generation times on lactose, (ii) neither strain expelled galactose during growth on lactose, (iii) both strains metabolized lactose and galactose concomitantly when grown in a medium containing both sugars, and (iv) the growth of the mutant was slightly reduced on galactose.
TI  - Influence of heat impact in reconstituted skim milk on the properties of yoghurt  fermented by ropy or non-ropy starter cultures.
AB  - The paper describes studies on the influence of heat impact in reconstituted skim milk on chemical and functional properties of yoghurt products. Reconstituted skim milk was heated for 20 min at 85 degrees C, 90 degrees C, or 95 degrees C. Ropy (producing exopolysaccharides, EPS) or non-ropy strains of S. thermophilus and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus were used as starter culture for yoghurt manufacture. The studies have shown that the fermentation times decreased with increasing heat impact when the ropy starter culture was used, while they remained to a far extent unchanged if the non-ropy starter culture was applied. The lactic acid contents of the yoghurt products were in the same range when the milk was heated at 85 degrees C or 90 degrees C, while they were different when milk was heated at 95 degrees C. There was a tendency visible that an increase in preheating leads to increased L(+)- and decreased D(-)-lactic acid contents if the non-ropy culture was applied. Using the ropy culture, it was vice versa. A slightly decrease in proteolysis with increasing heat impact was to be noted with both starter cultures. Concerning the relation of proteolysis to acidification, the fermentation process could be subdivided into three sections with different slopes if the non-ropy starter culture was used, while a linear relation was found if the ropy starter culture was applied. Regarding final product characteristics it was found that the functional properties of yoghurt decreased with increasing heat impact when the ropy starter culture was applied, while they remained to a far extent unchanged when the non-ropy starter culture was used. It can be concluded from these studies that a preheating of milk at a temperature of 85 degrees C (20 min) is optimal in regard to final yoghurt product characteristics.
TI  - Structural and functional analysis of pt38, a 2.9kb plasmid of Streptococcus thermophilus yogurt strain.
AB  - The cryptic plasmid pt38 (2911 bp) of Streptococcus thermophilus ST2783, a strain isolated from Bulgarian yogurt, was subcloned and sequenced. Five ORFs (ORF1 to ORF5) were identified, although putative transcription initiation and termination signals, and Shine-Dalgarno sequence could only be localized for three of them (ORF1, ORF2, and ORF5). ORF2 would specify a 142-amino acid protein sharing a high degree of homology with plasmid-born low-molecular-weight heat stress proteins described in a variety of S. thermophilus strains. On the other hand, ORF1 would encode a 311-residue protein, which was found to be almost identical to the putative Rep proteins of previously sequenced S. thermophilus rolling circle-replicating plasmids. Intracellular single-stranded pt38 DNA was detected, showing that, in fact, the plasmid replicates via a rolling circle mechanism. A putative double-strand origin with significant homology to that of pC194, and a ssoA-type single-strand origin were also identified on the nucleotide sequence of pt38. A DNA region that can be transcribed into a small RNA (ctRNA) complementary to the leader segment of the rep (ORF1) mRNA is proposed to be involved in the control of plasmid replication. In vitro synthesis of this ctRNA was observed, and this constitutes the first report on the existence of such antisense RNAs, likely acting as regulatory elements, in S. thermophilus plasmids.
TI  - Differentiation of Enterococcus faecium from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus strains by PCR and dot-blot hybridisation.
AB  - Variations in length and sequence of the 16S/23S spacer region of Enterococcus faecium provided the basis for development of simple PCR and dot-blot hybridisation assays that enabled the differentiation of potentially probiotic Enterococcus faecium strains from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Such assays may be useful for differentiation of yoghurt starter cultures and enterococcal strains when they are simultaneously present in probiotic food products.
TI  - Streptococcus thermophilus 580 produces a bacteriocin potentially suitable for inhibition of Clostridium tyrobutyricum in hard cheese.
AB  - A strain of Streptococcus thermophilus that inhibits Clostridium tyrobutyricum has been isolated from raw milk. The active compound produced disappears after a treatment with protease. However, unlike most bacteriocins, it is not thermoresistant, and the activity is completely lost after 1 h at 60 degrees C. Its inhibitory spectrum is limited to other thermophilic streptococci, Brochothrix, and sporulated gram-positive rods. So this bacteriocin could be different from those already described. This bacteriocin-producing strain could be used in thermophilic starter for hard cheese making because the bacteriocin is not active against thermophilic lactobacilli. It is produced in M17 medium during the decreasing temperature phase of the hard cheese-making process temperature cycle and is also produced in milk. Moreover, when Streptococcus thermophilus was cocultured with a Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis starter strain, it seems to enhance the bacteriocin production. However the level of activity always decreases drastically during the stationary phase. But inhibition of Clostridium tyrobutyricum spores can be obtained in small-scale curds.
TI  - Biology of the temperate Streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophage TP-J34 and physical characterization of the phage genome.
AB  - The temperate Streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophage TP-J34 was identified in the lysogenic host strain J34. The majority of phage particles produced upon induction was defective and noninfectious, consisting of DNA-filled heads lacking tails. A physical map (45.6 kb) was established. Analysis of minor restriction bands of the DNA isolated from phage particles as well as the analysis of the protein pattern indicated that phage TP-J34 is a pac-type phage. This was confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy using antisera raised against virulent cos- and pac-type S. thermophilus phages. The lysogenic host J34 but not its noninducible derivate J34-12 contained phage DNA in the nonintegrated state and exhibited autolysis at elevated temperatures. Prophage-carrying strains grew homogeneously while 16 of 20 prophage-cured derivatives aggregated and sedimented rapidly. When phage TP-J34 was propagated lytically on a prophage-cured host strain, a 2.7-kb site-specific deletion occurred in the phage genome. This deletion was also identified in the prophage DNAs of relysogenized strains.
TI  - A potential food-grade cloning vector for Streptococcus thermophilus that uses cadmium resistance as the selectable marker.
AB  - A potential food-grade cloning vector, pND919, was constructed and transformed into S. thermophilus ST3-1, a plasmid-free strain. The vector contains DNAs from two different food-approved organisms, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis. The 5.0-kb pND919 is a derivative of the cloning vector pND918 (9.3 kb) and was constructed by deletion of the 4.3-kb region of pND918 which contained DNA from non-food-approved organisms. pND919 carries a heterologous native cadmium resistance selectable marker from L. lactis M71 and expresses the Cd(r) phenotype in S. thermophilus transformants. With the S. thermophilus replicon derived from the shuttle vector pND913, pND919 is able to replicate in the two S. thermophilus industrial strains tested, ST3-1 and ST4-1. Its relatively high retention rate in S. thermophilus further indicates its usefulness as a potential food-grade cloning vector. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a replicative potential food-grade vector for the industrially important organism S. thermophilus.
TI  - Selection of bacteriophage-resistant mutants of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Phage-resistant mutants have been isolated from Streptococcus thermophilus. Selection was carried out using anti-phage antibodies or Hoechst 33258-labelled phages. Two mutants out of eight tested displayed reduced acidifying capacity. Selection of the bacteria that extruded more rapidly the fluorochrome 5-6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate (CFDA) restored the acidifying capacity of these two mutants to the level of the parental strains. Mutants displaying phage resistance and good acidifying capacity were obtained in 4-5 days. New phages that are able to overcome the protection mechanisms of the existing bacteria arise continually in the dairy environment. The procedures described here permit to replace promptly the starter culture susceptible to newly emerged phages with a resistant one.
TI  - Identification of the dimer interface of the lactose transport protein from Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The lactose transporter from Streptococcus thermophilus catalyses the symport of  galactosides and protons. The carrier domain of the protein harbours the contact sites for dimerization, and the individual subunits in the dimer interact functionally during the transport reaction. As a first step towards the elucidation of the mechanism behind the cooperation between the subunits, regions involved in the dimer interface were determined by oxidative and chemical cross-linking of 12 cysteine substitution mutants. Four positions in the protein were found to be susceptible to intermolecular cross-linking. To ensure that the observed cross-links were not the result of randomly colliding particles, the cross-linking was studied in samples in which either the concentration of LacS in the membrane was varied or the oligomeric state was manipulated. These experiments showed that the cross-links were formed specifically within the dimer. The four regions of the protein located at the dimer interface are close to the extracellular ends of transmembrane segments V and VIII and the intracellular ends of transmembrane segments VI and VII.
TI  - Prevention of heterocyclic amine-induced DNA damage in colon and liver of rats by different lactobacillus strains.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of four different lactobacillus (LB) strains, namely Lactobacillus bulgaricus 291, Streptococcus thermophilus F4, S.thermophilus V3 and Bifidobacterium longum BB536, which are used for the production of yogurt, on the DNA-damaging effects of heterocyclic aromatic amines (HCAs). Male F344 rats were treated orally with HCA mixtures containing 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine, 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline, 2-amino-3,4,8-trimethyl-3H-imidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline, 2-amino-9H-pyrido[2,3-b]indole and 2-amino-3-methyl-3H- imidazo[4,5-f]quinoline, which were representative of the HCA contents found in fried beef ('beef mix') and chicken ('chicken mix'). Suspensions of LB were given by gavage to the animals simultaneously with and at different time periods before administration of the HCAs. Subsequently, the extent of DNA migration was measured in colon and liver cells in single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assays. All four strains caused complete inhibition of DNA damage induced with beef mix after administration of 1 x 1010 LB cells/animal, whereas with chicken mix only marginal (non-significant) effects were seen. The inhibition of beef-induced DNA damage was dose dependent and was still significant when 1 x 107 cells/animal were administered. Kinetics studies showed that the protective effects were still significant when LB was given 12 h before the beef mix. A comparison of the present results with chemical analytical data from in vitro experiments suggests that the strong reduction in DNA migration seen in the animals can be only partly explained by direct binding effects. The results of the present study show that LB are highly protective against the genotoxic effects of HCAs under conditions which are relevant for humans and provide a possible explanation for the reduced colon cancer rates observed in some studies in individuals with either high LB counts in their feces or with a high consumption of LB-containing foods.
TI  - Genetic and biochemical characterization of the phosphoenolpyruvate:glucose/mannose phosphotransferase system of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - In most streptococci, glucose is transported by the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP):glucose/mannose phosphotransferase system (PTS) via HPr and IIAB(Man), two proteins involved in regulatory mechanisms. While most strains of Streptococcus thermophilus do not or poorly metabolize glucose, compelling evidence suggests that S. thermophilus possesses the genes that encode the glucose/mannose general and specific PTS proteins. The purposes of this study were to determine (i) whether these PTS genes are expressed, (ii) whether the PTS proteins encoded by these genes are able to transfer a phosphate group from PEP to glucose/mannose PTS substrates, and (iii) whether these proteins catalyze sugar transport. The pts operon is made up of the genes encoding HPr (ptsH) and enzyme I (EI) (ptsI), which are transcribed into a 0.6-kb ptsH mRNA and a 2.3-kb ptsHI mRNA. The specific glucose/mannose PTS proteins, IIAB(Man), IIC(Man), IID(Man), and the ManO protein, are encoded by manL, manM, manN, and manO, respectively, which make up the man operon. The man operon is transcribed into a single 3.5-kb mRNA. To assess the phosphotransfer competence of these PTS proteins, in vitro PEP-dependent phosphorylation experiments were conducted with purified HPr, EI, and IIAB(Man) as well as membrane fragments containing IIC(Man) and IID(Man). These PTS components efficiently transferred a phosphate group from PEP to glucose, mannose, 2-deoxyglucose, and (to a lesser extent) fructose, which are common streptococcal glucose/mannose PTS substrates. Whole cells were unable to catalyze the uptake of mannose and 2-deoxyglucose, demonstrating the inability of the S. thermophilus PTS proteins to operate as a proficient transport system. This inability to transport mannose and 2-deoxyglucose may be due to a defective IIC domain. We propose that in S. thermophilus, the general and specific glucose/mannose PTS proteins are not involved in glucose transport but might have regulatory functions associated with the phosphotransfer properties of HPr and IIAB(Man).
TI  - Growth and morphology of thermophilic dairy starters in alginate beads.
AB  - The aim of this research was to produce concentrated biomasses of thermophilic lactic starters using immobilized cell technology (ICT). Fermentations were carried out in milk using pH control with cells microentrapped in alginate beads. In the ICT fermentations, beads represented 17% of the weight. Some assays were carried out with free cells without pH control, in order to compare the ICT populations with those of classical starters. With Streptococcus thermophilus, overall populations in the fermentor were similar, but maximum bead population for (8.2 x 10(9) cfu/g beads) was 13 times higher than that obtained in a traditional starter (4.9 x 10(8) cfu/ml). For both Lactobacillus helveticus strains studied, immobilized-cell populations were about 3 x 10(9) cfu/g beads. Production of immobilized Lb. bulgaricus 210R strain was not possible, since no increases in viable counts occurred in beads. Therefore, production of concentrated cell suspension in alginate beads was more effective for S. thermophilus. Photomicrographs of cells in alginate beads demonstrated that, while the morphology of S. thermophilus remained unchanged during the ICT fermentation, immobilized cells of Lb. helveticus appeared wider. In addition, cells of Lb. bulgaricus were curved and elongated. These morphological changes would also impair the growth of immobilized lactobacilli.
TI  - [Design of primers to DNA of lactic acid bacteria].
AB  - Primers LP1-LP2 to the gene 16S rRNA have been developed, which permit to differentiate lactic acid bacteria: Lactobacillus plantarum, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. The strain-specific and species-specific differentiations are possible under different annealing temperature. Additional fragments, which are synthesized outside the framework of gene 16S rRNA reading, provide for the strain-specific type of differentiation, and the fragment F864 read in the gene 16S rRNA permits identifying L. plantarum.
TI  - PH-sensing 96-well microtitre plates for the characterization of acid production  by dairy starter cultures.
AB  - A new method for characterization of acid production by dairy starter cultures is presented. Microplates with integrated optical pH sensors are developed. Two fluorophores, a pH-sensitive and a pH-insensitive one are immobilised at the bottom of a polystyrene 96-well microtitre plate. The pH-insensitive fluorophore serves as an internal reference and makes calibration unnecessary. The sensor measures pH accurately in optically well-defined media. Particles and fluorophores contained in the bulk medium disturbed the measurements. Despite these disturbances it was possible to clearly sense differences in inoculum type and in inoculum sizes of cultures of Lactococcus lactis and of Streptococcus thermophilus at 30 and 37 degrees C. Besides a pH-related signal there is information about other changes during milk fermentation. The cultivation results were compared with those from the established CINAC-method. From this comparison it can be concluded that the new method can be used reliably to characterize particularly a large number of strains for screening purposes but also for quality control.
TI  - The role of nutrition in diarrhoea syndromes.
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Diarrhoea is a common and worldwide problem, accounting for significant morbidity and mortality, especially in children. This paper reviews recent advances in the field of nutritional intervention for the prevention and treatment of diarrhoeal diseases. RECENT FINDINGS: In the developing countries, the incidence of diarrhoeal diseases remains unchanged, whereas in industrialized areas a decrease has been reported. In acute diarrhoea, oral rehydration therapy is the treatment of first choice. Newer oral rehydration solutions with amylase-resistant starch or partially hydrolysed guar gum have been tested and found to be useful. Promising new data on supplementation with zinc in acute diarrhoea were published last year. The use of prebiotics and probiotics in the prevention and the treatment of diarrhoea is still controversial. However, new data and meta-analyses with probiotics are available, showing benefits in the treatment of acute diarrhoea as a co-treatment with oral rehydration. The same benefits were found to apply to antibiotic-associated diarrhoea syndromes. The co-administration of probiotics to patients receiving antibiotics seems to be a promising approach for reducing the incidence of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. New evidence suggests that fibre reduces diarrhoea associated with enteral tube feeding. Furthermore, a new probiotic mixture (VSL-3, viable lyophilized bacteria of 4 strains of Lactobacillus, 3 strains of Bifidobacterium and 1 strain of Streptococcus thermophilus (VSL Pharmaceuticals, Inc,. Ft. Lauderdale, FL. USA)) was of benefit in the treatment of bacterial overgrowth and in the prevention of diarrhoea after pelvic radiation treatment. SUMMARY: Oral rehydration is still the first line of treatment for acute diarrhoea. Zinc supplements have been shown to have a beneficial effect on acute diarrhoea in children. Probiotics and fibre have proved to be useful in the prevention and treatment of several diarrhoea syndromes. Because of the small numbers of patients and shortcomings in design and analysis, additional large placebo-controlled trials of the effects of fibre and probiotics, or a combination of both, in diarrhoea syndromes are needed.
TI  - Effects of milk products fermented by Bifidobacterium longum on blood lipids in rats and healthy adult male volunteers.
AB  - The effects of milk products fermented by Bifidobacterium longum strain BL1, a probiotic strain, on blood lipids in rats and humans were studied. Rats were fed a cholesterol-enriched experimental diet, supplemented with lyophilized powders of 1) acid milk (control), 2) milk fermented with a mixed culture of ordinary yogurt starters composed of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (SL), and 3) bifidobacterium milk fermented with the probiotic B. longum strain BL1, respectively. The bifidobacterium milk feeding brought about significant lowering of the serum concentrations of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides, in comparison with the control, while no change in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration was observed. On the other hand, supplementation with SL milk resulted in only slight, nonsignificant decreases in serum lipid concentrations in comparison with the control. In the human study, 32 subjects with serum total cholesterol ranging from 220 to 280 mg/dl were randomly assigned to two treatments: 1) intake of a low-fat drinking yogurt prepared with ordinary yogurt starters composed of S. thermophilus and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (P-group) and 2) intake of a low-fat drinking yogurt prepared with the two ordinary yogurt starters plus B. longum strain BL1 (B-group). After intake for 4 wk at 3 x 100 ml/day, reduction of serum total cholesterol was observed in approximately half of the B-group subjects; a particularly significant decrease in serum total cholesterol was found among subjects with moderate hypercholesterolemia (serum total cholesterol > 240 mg/dl). However, the serum lipid concentrations in the P-group subjects were almost stable during the experimental periods. The present results indicate the potential of the probiotic B. longum strain BL1 in serum lipid improvement.
TI  - Selective enumeration of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacteria, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and propionibacteria.
AB  - Nineteen bacteriological media were evaluated to assess their suitability to selectively enumerate Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacteria, and propionibacteria. Bacteriological media evaluated included Streptococcus thermophilus agar, pH modified MRS agar, MRS-vancomycine agar, MRS-bile agar, MRS-NaCl agar, MRS-lithium chloride agar, MRS-NNLP (nalidixic acid, neomycin sulfate, lithium chloride and paramomycine sulfate) agar, reinforced clostridial agar, sugar-based (such as maltose, galactose, sorbitol, manitol, esculin) media, sodium lactate agar, arabinose agar, raffinose agar, xylose agar, and L. casei agar. Incubations were carried out under aerobic and anaerobic conditions at 27, 30, 37, 43, and 45 degrees C for 24, 72 h, and 7 to 9 d. S. thermophilus agar and aerobic incubation at 37 degrees C for 24 h were suitable for S. thermophilus. L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus could be enumerated using MRS agar (pH 4.58 or pH 5.20) and under anaerobic incubation at 45 degrees C for 72 h. MRS-vancomycine agar and anaerobic incubation at 43 degrees C for 72 h were suitable to enumerate L. rhamnosus. MRS-vancomycine agar and anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees C for 72 h were selective for L. casei. To estimate the counts of L. casei by subtraction method, counts of L. rhamnosus on MRS-vancomycine agar at 43 degrees C for 72 h under anaerobic incubation could be subtracted from total counts of L. casei and L. rhamnosus enumerated on MRS-vancomycine agar at 37 degrees C for 72 h under anaerobic incubation. L. acidophilus could be enumerated using MRS-agar at 43 degrees C for 72 h or Basal agar-maltose agar at 43 degrees C for 72 h or BA-sorbitol agar at 37 degrees C for 72 h, under anaerobic incubation. Bifidobacteria could be enumerated on MRS-NNLP agar under anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees C for 72 h. Propionibacteria could be enumerated on sodium lactate agar under anaerobic incubation at 30 degrees C for 7 to 9 d. A subtraction method was most suitable for counting propionibacteria in the presence of other lactic acid bacteria from a product. For this method, counts of lactic bacteria at d 3 on sodium lactate agar under anaerobic incubation at 30 degrees C were subtracted from counts at d 7 of lactic bacteria and propionibacteria.
TI  - Effects of cultivation conditions on folate production by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - A variety of lactic acid bacteria were screened for their ability to produce folate intracellularly and/or extracellularly. Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Leuconostoc spp. all produced folate, while most Lactobacillus spp., with the exception of Lactobacillus plantarum, were not able to produce folate. Folate production was further investigated in L. lactis as a model organism for metabolic engineering and in S. thermophilus for direct translation to (dairy) applications. For both these two lactic acid bacteria, an inverse relationship was observed between growth rate and folate production. When cultures were grown at inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics or salt or when the bacteria were subjected to low growth rates in chemostat cultures, folate levels in the cultures were increased relative to cell mass and (lactic) acid production. S. thermophilus excreted more folate than L. lactis, presumably as a result of differences in the number of glutamyl residues of the folate produced. In S. thermophilus 5,10-methenyl and 5-formyl tetrahydrofolate were detected as the major folate derivatives, both containing three glutamyl residues, while in L. lactis 5,10-methenyl and 10-formyl tetrahydrofolate were found, both with either four, five, or six glutamyl residues. Excretion of folate was stimulated at lower pH in S. thermophilus, but pH had no effect on folate excretion by L. lactis. Finally, several environmental parameters that influence folate production in these lactic acid bacteria were observed; high external pH increased folate production and the addition of p-aminobenzoic acid stimulated folate production, while high tyrosine concentrations led to decreased folate biosynthesis.
TI  - Application of the shsp gene, encoding a small heat shock protein, as a food-grade selection marker for lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Plasmid pSt04 of Streptococcus thermophilus contains a gene encoding a protein with homology to small heat shock proteins (A. Geis, H. A. M. El Demerdash, and K. J. Heller, Plasmid 50:53-69, 2003). Strains cured from the shsp plasmids showed significantly reduced heat and acid resistance and a lower maximal growth temperature. Transformation of the cloned shsp gene into S. thermophilus St11 lacking a plasmid encoding shsp resulted in increased resistance to incubation at 60 degrees C or pH 3.5 and in the ability to grow at 52 degrees C. A food-grade cloning system for S. thermophilus, based on the plasmid-encoded shsp gene as a selection marker, was developed. This approach allowed selection after transfer of native and recombinant shsp plasmids into different S. thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis strains. Using a recombinant plasmid carrying an erythromycin resistance (Em(r)) gene in addition to shsp, we demonstrated that both markers are equally efficient in selecting for plasmid-bearing cells. The average transformation rates in S. thermophilus (when we were selecting for heat resistance) were determined to be 2.4 x 10(4) and 1.0 x 10(4) CFU/0.5 micro g of DNA, with standard deviations of 0.54 x 10(4) and 0.32 x 10(4), for shsp and Em(r) selection, respectively. When we selected for pH resistance, the average transformation rates were determined to be 2.25 x 10(4) and 3.8 x 10(3) CFU/0.5 micro g of DNA, with standard deviations of 0.63 x 10(4) and 3.48 x 10(3), for shsp and Em(r) selection, respectively. The applicability of shsp as a selection marker was further demonstrated by constructing S. thermophilus plasmid pHRM1 carrying the shsp gene as a selection marker and the restriction-modification genes of another S. thermophilus plasmid as a functional trait.
TI  - [Comparative microbiological study of fresh and heat-treated yoghurt in an in vivo animal model].
AB  - In an acute assay, rats fasted for 24 h were sounded with 2 ml of fresh yogurt, sterilised yogurt or distilled water, and sacrificed at 2, 4, 8 and 24 h. They were compared with non-sounded rats. The survival of the lactic bacteria of the yogurt administered in the animals' stomach and intestines was determined, and the bacteria isolated were to the Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus profiles belonging to the strains isolated originally from the yogurt. Counts of the total number of microorganisms that were grown in lactobacilli and lactic streptococci media were also made. Analyses of the different types of resulting colonies in the lactobacilli and lactic streptococci media was performed. No L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus or S. thermophilus were characterized in this acute assay. The statistical analysis of the results did not show significant differences in the log UFC. g-1, of the intestinal microbiota microorganisms of the three groups of animals in any of the times. In a chronic assay, three groups of animals, after 30 days of nourishment ad libitum with either a semisynthetic diet with 10% of fresh yogurt, or with 10% of sterilised yogurt or controls, housed in individual metabolism cells, were sacrificed. The results did not show meaningful differences in the long UFC. g-1 of the intestinal microbiota microorganisms from the three groups of animals in any of the times. In turn, in the study of the different types of colonies resulting in the lactobacilli and lactic streptococci media, no L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus or S. thermophilus were characterised in this chronic assay. The results did not show meaningful differences in the log CFU. g-1 of the intestinal flora microorganisms from the three groups of animals in any of the times. In turn, no L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus or S. thermophilus were characterised in this chronic assay.
TI  - Pediocin production by recombinant lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Production of the anti-listerial bacteriocin, pediocin, by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) transformed with the cloning vector pPC418 (Ped+, 9.1 kb) was influenced by composition of media and incubation temperature. Maximum pediocin production, tested against Listeria innocua, by electrotransformants of Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis was measured in tryptone/lactose/yeast extract medium after 24 h growth at 30 degrees C, while incubation at 40 degrees C was optimum for Ped+ transformants of Streptococcus thermophilus and Enterococcus faecalis. The amount of pediocin produced by S. thermophilus in skim milk and cheese whey supplemented with 0.5% yeast extract was estimated as 51,000 units ml(-1) and 25,000 units ml(-1), respectively. Pediocin production remained essentially unchanged in reconstituted skim milk or whey media diluted up to 10-fold. The results demonstrate the capacity of recombinant strains of LAB to produce pediocin in a variety of growth media including skim milk and inexpensive cheese whey-based media, requiring minimum nutritional supplementation.
TI  - [Evaluation of the activity of probiotic cultures over Listeria monocytogenes during the production and storage of yogurt].
AB  - The effect of probiotic cultures over Listeria monocytogenes during the production and storage of yogurt was evaluated. A yogurt mixture (10.6% non-fat solid liquids, 3% fat and 0.3% gelatin) was prepared, homogenized and pasteurized. Yogurt was inoculated with 0, 10(2), 10(4) and 10(6) CFU/mL of L. monocytogenes and 0.02% of traditional lactic culture YC 180 (Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus) and probiotic culture ABY-1 (Bifidobacterium longum, B. bifidum, B, infantis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus thermophilus y Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus). It was incubated for 3 h at 43 degrees C until pH reached an approximate value of 4.8, followed by refrigeration at 5 degrees C for 21 days. During fermentation, samples were taken every hour, and during storage every 3 days, analyzing pH and lactic, bifidobacteria and pathogen count for each time. It was demonstrated that there was no significant simple effect for the type of culture used (ABY-1 and YC 180) (p = 0.684) over the amount of L. monocytogenes present in yogurt during the fermentation and storage periods. The presence of bifidobacteria in the ABY-1 culture did not present a significant effect over L. monocytogenes. Neither the effect of time presented a significant effect over L. monocytogenes (p = 0.448). In this case, the ABY-1 and YC 180 cultures present a bacteriostatic effect over the pathogen. The probiotic cultures had a bacteriostatic but not bactericidal effect over L. monocytogenes. This is not related to the protective effect of these cultures in bowel, since in-vivo conditions favor the production of antimicrobial substances, such as bacteriocins that act over pathogens.
TI  - Proteolytic degradation of ewe milk proteins during fermentation of yoghurts and  storage.
AB  - Yoghurts are mostly produced from cow milk and to a very limited extent from ewe  milk. The evolution of caseins and whey proteins in ovine milk submitted to different thermal treatments (63 degrees C/30 min; 73 degrees C/15 min; 85 degrees C/10 min or 96 degrees C/5 min) was followed during fermentation of yoghurts and during their storage up to 14 days, using two different sets of starters. One set of starter LAB was a "ropy" culture (YC-191), which is a well-defined mixed strain culture containing Streptococcus thermophilus ST-143 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (LB-18 and LB-CH2). The other set of starter bacteria (YC-460) was a standard yoghurt culture("non-ropy") containing mixed strain culture of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. Contents of free amino groups in produced yoghurts increased gradually during the fermentation, up to a maximal value obtained after 4 h fermentation, then they did not change significantly during storage of yoghurt produced with YC-191 starter. In contrary, a large drop in the amount of free amino groups was observed in the first 24 h of storage in the case of yoghurt made with YC-460 indicating that microorganisms continue still to grow in low temperatures. During fermentation and storage of both yoghurt types, alpha-lactalbumin was hydrolyzed to a slightly bigger extent than beta-lactoglobulin. During fermentation, beta-casein was slightly more degraded than alpha(s)-caseins; however, the opposite was observed during storage up to 14 days. Generally, a more intense heat pretreatment led to a higher degradation of whey proteins and caseins during fermentation and storage. Differences in proteolytic activity between the two starters used (whey proteins more degraded by YC-191; caseins more degraded by YC-460) may lead to improvement in production and formulation of yoghurts differing in their physicochemical and rheological properties.
TI  - Antioxidative effects of lactic acid bacteria on the colonic mucosa of iron-overloaded mice.
AB  - The antioxidative effects of lactic acid bacteria on lipid peroxidation in the colonic mucosa were investigated. Among 49 strains of lactic acid bacteria, Streptococcus thermophilus YIT 2001 showed the highest inhibitory activity against lipid peroxidation in liposomes induced by ferrous iron. Feeding a diet containing 0.4% St. thermophilus YIT 2001 (2 x 10(8) colony-forming units per mouse per day) for 2 weeks caused a significant decrease of lipid peroxide (thiobarbituric acid reactive substance) in the colonic mucosa of iron-overloaded mice (0.07% Fe in the diet). The mucosal lipid peroxide level did not correlate with the soluble iron concentration of the cecal contents. Therefore, it is suggested that the antioxidative effect of St. thermophilus YIT 2001 in the colonic mucosa was not due to the removal of ferrous iron from the reaction system of lipid peroxidation.
TI  - Bacterial community dynamics during production of registered designation of origin Salers cheese as evaluated by 16S rRNA gene single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis.
AB  - Microbial dynamics during processing and ripening of traditional cheeses such as  registered designation of origin Salers cheese, an artisanal cheese produced in France, play an important role in the elaboration of sensory qualities. The aim of the present study was to obtain a picture of the dynamics of the microbial ecosystem of RDO Salers cheese by using culture-independent methods. This included DNA extraction, PCR, and single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. Bacterial and high-GC% gram-positive bacterial primers were used to amplify V2 or V3 regions of the 16S rRNA gene. SSCP patterns revealed changes during the manufacturing of the cheese. Patterns of the ecosystems of cheeses that were provided by three farmers were also quite different. Cloning and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene revealed sequences related to lactic acid bacteria (Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus pentosus), which were predominant during manufacturing and ripening. Bacteria belonging to the high-GC% gram-positive group (essentially corynebacteria) were found by using specific primers. The present molecular approach can effectively describe the ecosystem of artisanal dairy products.
TI  - Sequence analysis and characterization of plasmids from Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The nucleotide sequences of eight plasmids isolated from seven Streptococcus thermophilus strains have been determined. Plasmids pSt04, pER1-1, and pJ34 are related and replicate via a rolling circle mechanism. Plasmid pJ34 encodes for a replication initiation protein (RepA) and a small polypeptide with unknown function. Plasmids pSt04 and pER1-1 carry in addition to repA genes coding for small heat shock proteins (sHsp). Expression of these proteins is induced at elevated temperatures or low pH and increases the thermo- and acid resistance. Plasmids pER1-2 and pSt22-2 show identical sequences with five putative open reading frames (ORFs). The gene products of ORF1 and ORF4 reveal some similarities to transposon encoded proteins of Bacillus subtilis and Tn916. ORF1 of plasmid pSt106 encodes a protein similar to resolvases of different Gram-positive bacteria. Integrity of ORF2 and 3, encoding a putative DNA primase and a replication protein, is essential for replication. ORF1 to 3 of plasmid pSt08, which are organized in a tricistronic operon, encode a RepA protein, an adenosine-specific methyltransferase, and a type II restriction endonuclease. Another type II restriction-modification (R/M) system is encoded on plasmid pSt0 which is highly similar to those encoded on lactococcal plasmid pHW393 and B. subtilis plasmid pXH13. Plasmid-free derivatives of strains St0 and St08 show increased phage sensitivity, indicating that in the wild-type strains the R/M systems are functionally expressed. Recombinant plasmids based on the replicons of plasmids pSt04, pJ34, pSt106, pSt08, and pSt0, are able to replicate in Lactococcus lactis and B. subtilis, respectively, whereas constructs carrying pER1-2 only replicate in S. thermophilus.
TI  - Ester synthesis in an aqueous environment by Streptococcus thermophilus and other dairy lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The ability of Streptococcus thermophilus ST1 and 19 other dairy lactic acid bacteria (LAB) to synthesize esters was investigated in an aqueous environment. These LAB were able to synthesize esters from alcohols and glycerides via a transferase reaction (alcoholysis) in which fatty acyl groups from glycerides were transferred to alcohols. S. thermophilus ST1 was active on tributyrin and on di- or monoglycerides of up to C10 with ethanol as the acyl acceptor. This strain was also active on a diglyceride of C6 and monoglyceride of C8 with 2-phenyl ethanol as the acyl acceptor. Alcoholysis occurred preferentially over hydrolysis. S. thermophilus ST1 had an apparent K(m) value of 250 mM for ethanol and an apparent K(m) value of 1.3 mM for tributyrin, measured against whole cells. Around 80% of both the transferase activity and the esterase activity were detected in the cell-free extract (CFE) of strain ST1. Both activities in the CFEs of five LAB tested were, to a similar degree, enhanced slightly by growth in the presence of ethanol and tributyrin. Using tributyrin and ethanol as substrates, the transferase activities ranged over 0.006-1.37 units/mg cell dry weight among the LAB tested and were both species- and strain-dependent.
TI  - The effect of temperature and pH on the growth of lactic acid bacteria: a pH-auxostat study.
AB  - The growth of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus paracasei was studied in a pH-auxostat. The computer-controlled smooth change of pH or temperature was used to study the effect of pH and temperature on the culture characteristics (specific growth rate mu growth yield Y(ATP) and specific lactate production rate Q(ATP)). The behaviour of mu and Q(ATP) with an increase of temperature suggested that ATP production capacity was an important factor in determining the maximum growth rate of lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The decrease of Y(ATP) with increase of temperature resulted in the decrease of specific growth rate while Q(ATP) remained constant or even increased. With the decrease of pH, decrease of both Y(ATP) and Q(ATP) was observed. S. thermophilus St20 having the highest maximum specific growth rate of 2.2 h(-1) at 44 degrees C was the most acid sensitive strain. The L. paracasei E1H3 having the lowest mu(max) was the most tolerant strain to pH change. The behaviour of mixed culture of L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus in milk in a pH-auxostat with pH-decrease was in agreement with the pure culture experiments of the same species. The study showed that pH-auxostat with smooth controlled change of pH and temperature is an effective method for determination of technological characteristics and comparative physiological study of LAB.
TI  - Immunostimulatory oligonucleotide, CpG-like motif exists in Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus NIAI B6.
AB  - The present study was conducted to find an immunostimulatory oligonucleotide derived from yogurt starter cultures. The chromosomal DNA was purified from nine strains of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and six strains of Streptococcus thermophilus. An immunostimulatory ability of the DNA was examined in a proliferation of peyer's patch and splenic B cells. Only the DNA from L. bulgaricus NIAI B6 induced a significant proliferation of both cells. When the DNA was cloned and amplified using PCR, the mitogenic activities to B cells were significantly increased by 13 of 135 DNA clones. Ten homologous nucleotide sequences were found as possible oligonucleotide sequences of mitogens, and were then chemically synthesized (sOL-LB1 to sOL-LB10). One CpG-like motif (sOL-LB7; 5'-CGGCACGCTCACGATTCTTG-3') was identified as an immunostimulatory oligonucleotide, but it did not contain palindromic CpG structure known as a B cell-specific mitogen. The sOL-LB7 substantially bound to B cells and increased the CD69 positive cells in peyer's patch cells. This study demonstrated that L. bulgaricus NIAI B6 was a good candidate of a starter culture for the production of new functional foods, "Bio-Defense Foods".
TI  - Live probiotics protect intestinal epithelial cells from the effects of infection with enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC).
AB  - BACKGROUND: The colonic epithelium maintains a life long reciprocally beneficial  interaction with the colonic microbiota. Disruption is associated with mucosal injury. AIMS: We hypothesised that probiotics may limit epithelial damage induced by enteroinvasive pathogens, and promote restitution. METHODS: Human intestinal epithelial cell lines (HT29/cl.19A and Caco-2) were exposed to enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC 029:NM), and/or probiotics (Streptococcus thermophilus (ST), ATCC19258, and Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA), ATCC4356). Infected cells and controls were assessed for transepithelial resistance, chloride secretory responses, alterations in cytoskeletal and tight junctional proteins, and responses to epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation. RESULTS: Exposure of cell monolayers to live ST/LA, but not to heat inactivated ST/LA, significantly limited adhesion, invasion, and physiological dysfunction induced by EIEC. Antibiotic killed ST/LA reduced adhesion somewhat but were less effective in limiting the consequences of EIEC invasion of cell monolayers. Furthermore, live ST/LA alone increased transepithelial resistance, contrasting markedly with the fall in resistance evoked by EIEC infection, which could also be blocked by live ST/LA. The effect of ST/LA on resistance was accompanied by maintenance (actin, ZO-1) or enhancement (actinin, occludin) of cytoskeletal and tight junctional protein phosphorylation. ST/LA had no effect on chloride secretion by themselves but reversed the increase in basal secretion evoked by EIEC. EIEC also reduced the ability of EGF to activate its receptor, which was reversed by ST/LA. CONCLUSIONS: Live ST/LA interact with intestinal epithelial cells to protect them from the deleterious effect of EIEC via mechanisms that include, but are not limited to, interference with pathogen adhesion and invasion. Probiotics likely also enhance the barrier function of naive epithelial cells not exposed to any pathogen.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of commercial annatto extracts against selected pathogenic, lactic acid, and spoilage microorganisms.
AB  - Annatto preparations are used to impart distinctive flavor and color to foods and are a primary colorant in dairy foods such as cheese and butter. There are several reports indicating that certain fractions of the annatto plant have biological activities against microorganisms of significance in food fermentation, food preservation, and human health. However, little is reported describing the nature of the antimicrobial compound(s) or their potential presence in commercial annatto colorant preparations. This study was conducted to determine whether commonly available annatto extracts are capable of influencing the outgrowth of selected lactic acid, spoilage, and pathogenic microorganisms. Disk diffusion and tube macrodilution techniques were used to determine the MICs and MBCs of double-strength water-soluble annatto extracts. Standard antibiotic disks were used as controls for the disk diffusion assay. The results demonstrate that annatto has an inhibitory effect on Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, and Staphylococcus aureus, with MICs of 0.08, 0.31, and 0.16% (vol/vol) and diameters of inhibition of 9 to 10, 12 to 13, and 15 to 16 mm, respectively. A concentration of 0.63% (vol/vol) inhibited the growth of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, Lactococcus lactis, and Paenibacillus polymyxa. The MICs for Listeria monocytogenes and Enterococcus durans were 1.25 and 2.5% (vol/vol), respectively. No activity was detected against Lactobacillus plantarum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, yeasts, or selected gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Consensus-degenerate hybrid oligonucleotide primers for amplification of priming  glycosyltransferase genes of the exopolysaccharide locus in strains of the Lactobacillus casei group.
AB  - A primer design strategy named CODEHOP (consensus-degenerate hybrid oligonucleotide primer) for amplification of distantly related sequences was used to detect the priming glycosyltransferase (GT) gene in strains of the Lactobacillus casei group. Each hybrid primer consisted of a short 3' degenerate core based on four highly conserved amino acids and a longer 5' consensus clamp region based on six sequences of the priming GT gene products from exopolysaccharide (EPS)-producing bacteria. The hybrid primers were used to detect the priming GT gene of 44 commercial isolates and reference strains of Lactobacillus rhamnosus, L. casei, Lactobacillus zeae, and Streptococcus thermophilus. The priming GT gene was detected in the genome of both non-EPS-producing (EPS(-)) and EPS-producing (EPS(+)) strains of L. rhamnosus. The sequences of the cloned PCR products were similar to those of the priming GT gene of various gram-negative and gram-positive EPS(+) bacteria. Specific primers designed from the L. rhamnosus RW-9595M GT gene were used to sequence the end of the priming GT gene in selected EPS(+) strains of L. rhamnosus. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Lactobacillus spp. form a distinctive group apart from other lactic acid bacteria for which GT genes have been characterized to date. Moreover, the sequences show a divergence existing among strains of L. rhamnosus with respect to the terminal region of the priming GT gene. Thus, the PCR approach with consensus-degenerate hybrid primers designed with CODEHOP is a practical approach for the detection of similar genes containing conserved motifs in different bacterial genomes.
TI  - Purification, characterization, and gene cloning of lysyl aminoeptidase from Streptococcus thermophilus YRC001.
AB  - We purified and characterized an aminopeptidase from Streptococcus thermophilus YRC001 to obtain an enzyme for the application of reducing bitter-defect in cheese manufacturing. The purified enzyme was a monomer, and its molecular mass was estimated to be 90-100 kDa. It had a broad substrate specificity, and mostly hydrolyzed lysyl and leucyl peptides. The optimal temperature and pH for the enzyme were 35 degrees C and pH 6.5, respectively. EDTA, o-phenanthroline, and p-chloromercuribenzoate inhibited its activity, therefore it was considered to be a metallopeptidase. The purified enzyme efficiently reduced the bitterness of a trypsin digest of reconstituted skim milk. Therefore, we cloned a gene for the enzyme from YRC001. The nucleotide sequence of a 2,940-bp XbaI fragment containing the gene was analyzed. The gene encoded 849 amino acids, and the calculated molecular mass for the mature enzyme (initial methionine is removed) was 96,434. The deduced amino acid sequence showed high homology with the known bacterial lysyl aminopeptidase (aminopeptidase N).
TI  - Influence of the oral administration of lactic acid bacteria on iga producing cells associated to bronchus.
AB  - Intestinal, respiratory and genitourinary mucosal surfaces are the most important routes of entry for microbial pathogens. The stimulus of the mucosal immunity is not easy because the trigger keys for the activation do not follow the ones of the systemic immune response. In previous works we have demonstrated that some Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB), when orally administered, can induce an enhance of the gut immune response. Taking into account the concept of a common mucosal response, we studied the effect of orally administered mice with Lactobacillus casei, L. acidophilus, L. rhamnosus, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis on the IgA secreting cells associated to bronchus. As shown before, oral immunostimulation with LAB induced an increase of the IgA* cells at intestinal level by a dose depending effect. In this study it is also showed that the LAB assayed, with exception of L. acidophilus, were able to enhance IgA+ cells at bronchial level, being also this effect dose dependent. The increment induced by some LAB in the number of IgA+ cells on the mucosa surface of the lower respiratory tract may be very important to prevent bronchus diseases.
TI  - Microstructure and rheology of yogurt made with cultures differing only in their  ability to produce exopolysaccharides.
AB  - Yogurt was made using an exopolysaccharide-producing strain of Streptococcus thermophilus and its genetic variant that only differed from the mother strain in its inability to produce exopolysaccharides. The microstructure was investigated using confocal scanning laser microscopy, allowing observation of fully hydrated yogurt and the distribution of exopolysaccharide within the protein network. Yogurt made with the exopolysaccharide-producing culture exhibited increased consistency coefficients, but lower flow behavior index, yield stress, viscoelastic moduli and phase angle values than did yogurt made with the culture unable to produce exopolysaccharide. The exopolysaccharides, when present, were found in pores in the gel network separate from the aggregated protein. These effects could be explained by the incompatibility of the exopolysaccharides with the protein aggregates in the milk. Stirring affected the yogurt made with exopolysaccharide differently from yogurt without exopolysaccharide, as it did not exhibit immediate syneresis, although the structural breakdown was increased. The shear-induced microstructure in a yogurt made with exopolysaccharide-producing culture was shown to consist of compartmentalized protein aggregates between channels containing exopolysaccharide, hindering syneresis as well as the buildup of structure after stirring.
TI  - Regulation of branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis by alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - AIMS: To demonstrate the presence of an active alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase in Streptococcus thermophilus and to investigate its physiological function. METHODS AND RESULTS: Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ385 contains a gene encoding an alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase. Comparison of the production of alpha-acetolactate and its decarboxylation products, by the parent strain and an alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase-deficient mutant, demonstrated the presence of a control of the pool of alpha-acetolactate by valine, leucine and isoleucine. This control occurs via an allosteric activation of the alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase. Cell-free extracts of S. thermophilus were not able to decarboxylate the isoleucine precursor alpha-acetohydroxybutyrate. CONCLUSIONS: These results strongly suggest that one of the physiological functions of the alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase in S. thermophilus is to regulate leucine and valine biosynthesis by diverting the flux of alpha-acetolactate towards acetoin when the branched-chain amino acids are present at a high concentration. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Regulation of branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis by alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase may occur in several other micro-organisms and explain some of their growth properties.
TI  - Cell wall attachment of a widely distributed peptidoglycan binding domain is hindered by cell wall constituents.
AB  - The C-terminal region (cA) of the major autolysin AcmA of Lactococcus lactis contains three highly similar repeated regions of 45 amino acid residues (LysM domains), which are separated by nonhomologous sequences. The cA domain could be deleted without destroying the cell wall-hydrolyzing activity of the enzyme in vitro. This AcmA derivative was capable neither of binding to lactococcal cells nor of lysing these cells while separation of the producer cells was incomplete. The cA domain and a chimeric protein consisting of cA fused to the C terminus of MSA2, a malaria parasite surface antigen, bound to lactococcal cells specifically via cA. The fusion protein also bound to many other Gram-positive bacteria. By chemical treatment of purified cell walls of L. lactis and Bacillus subtilis, peptidoglycan was identified as the cell wall component interacting with cA. Immunofluorescence studies showed that binding is on specific locations on the surface of L. lactis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus thermophilus, B. subtilis, Lactobacillus sake, and Lactobacillus casei cells. Based on these studies, we propose that LysM-type repeats bind to peptidoglycan and that binding is hindered by other cell wall constituents, resulting in localized binding of AcmA. Lipoteichoic acid is a candidate hindering component. For L. lactis SK110, it is shown that lipoteichoic acids are not uniformly distributed over the cell surface and are mainly present at sites where no MSA2cA binding is observed.
TI  - Intestinal pathway of internalisation of lactic acid bacteria and gut mucosal immunostimulation.
AB  - The induction of the gut mucosal immune response is dependent on the antigen interacting with the M cells of Peyer's patches and with the immune cells associated with this lymphoid organ. In previous studies we showed that the mucosal immunostimulation by LAB varied depending upon the strain being studied. Some of them increased the inflammatory immune response and others enhanced the level of secretory antibody (S-IgA). Our aim was to determine the pathway of the internalisation of LAB strains in the intestine, to provide a basis for understing the different behaviour exhibited by them. The presence of LAB on Peyer's patches or in the immune cells associated with the villi of small intestine was determined using fluorescein-labelled bacteria and by transmission electron microscopy. Mice were dosed orally by intubation, with 10<sup>1</sup> cells of labelled single strains of Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus. For electron microscopy studies unlabelled bacteria were used. Histological preparations of the small and large intestine were performed 1 hour after administration of the bacteria. Fluorescent bacteria of L. casei and S. thermophilus were found only in Peyer's patches while L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and L. acidophilus were observed in Peyer's patches and in the small intestine. L. acidophilus was also found in the large intestine. We confirmed these findings by electron microscopy. We determined that for L. casei the pathway of internalisation was via the M and FAE cells of Peyer's patches, while for S. thermophilus, L. acidophilus and L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus the interaction with the immune cells of Peyer's patches was through the follicle associated epithelium (FAE). L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and L. acidophilus also interacted with the epithelial cells of the small intestine and L. acidophilus with epithelial cells of the large intestine. These results suggest that the different effects of LAB on the mucosal immunostimulation, are related to the different pathways of gut internalisation used to take contact with the immune cells associated with the lamina propria intestinal.
TI  - Biochemistry, genetics, and applications of exopolysaccharide production in Streptococcus thermophilus: a review.
AB  - Many strains of Streptococcus thermophilus synthesize extracellular polysaccharides. These molecules may be produced as capsules that are tightly associated with the cell, or they may be liberated into the medium as a loose slime (i.e., "ropy" polysaccharide). Although the presence of exopolysaccharide does not confer any obvious advantage to growth or survival of S. thermophilus in milk, in situ production by this species or other dairy lactic acid bacteria typically imparts a desirable "ropy" or viscous texture to fermented milk products. Recent work has also shown that exopolysaccharide-producing S. thermophilus can enhance the functional properties of Mozzarella cheese, but they are not phage-proof. As our understanding of the genetics, physiology, and functionality of bacterial exopolysaccharides continues to improve, novel applications for polysaccharides and polysaccharide-producing cultures are likely to emerge inside and outside the dairy industry. This article provides an overview of biochemistry, genetics, and applications of exopolysaccharide production in S. thermophilus.
TI  - 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region sequence variation in Streptococcus thermophilus and related dairy streptococci and development of a multiplex ITS-SSCP analysis for their identification.
AB  - The 16S-23S rRNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of several Streptococcus thermophilus strains and some related dairy streptococci, S. macedonicus, S. salivarius and S. bovis, was analysed by sequence analysis. All the Streptococcus species were easily discriminated on the basis of sequence variations principally located upstream and downstream of the region encompassing the double-stranded processing sites and the tRNA(Ala) gene. Comparison between tRNA(Ala) gene sequences highlighted a high level of sequence conservation among the Streptococcus species investigated despite their belonging to separated phylogenetic clusters, i.e. the S. salivarius and S. bovis rRNA groups. A low but significant degree of variability was detected among the S. thermophilus strains, allowing the identification of four different ITS sequences. Similarity analysis of the ITS sequences showed that the Streptococcus species were clustered in two main branches, one containing S. macedonicus and S. bovis strains, and one containing S. thermophilus and S. salivarius strains. With the aim of developing a rapid tool for the identification of the dairy streptococci species a multiplex ITS-SSCP analysis of two discrete regions within the ITS locus was carried out.
TI  - Impaired temperature stress response of a Streptococcus thermophilus deoD mutant.
AB  - An insertional deoD mutant of Streptococcus thermophilus strain SFi39 had a reduced growth rate at 20 degrees C and an enhanced survival capacity to heat shock compared to the wild type, indicating that the deoD product is involved in temperature shock adaptation. We report evidence that ppGpp is implicated in this dual response.
TI  - Evolution of microbial populations during traditional Feta cheese manufacture and ripening.
AB  - In three different dairies (A, B and C) located in Peloponess region (Southern Greece), traditional Feta cheese trials took place February to March using mixtures of sheep's and goat's milk. Only small variations in the evolution of microbial groups were observed during the whole ripening period. The main groups, such as thermophilic cocci, mesophilic lactococci, thermophilic lactobacilli, nonstarter lactic acid bacteria (NSLAB), presumptive Leuconostoc, enterococci and micrococci, reached their highest levels during the first 16 days, and then declined approximately 1-2 log units until the end of ripening. The remaining groups investigated, comprising yeasts, coliforms and Escherichia coli, were highest at day 4. The yeasts remained constant, while coliforms and E. coli decreased sharply and were not detectable after 120 days of ripening. A number of 146 isolates (dairy A) taken from all stages of the manufacturing and ripening process were purified and studied. Lactobacillus plantarum (58/146) and isolates of related species Lactobacillus pentosus and Lactobacillus paraplantarum (16/146) were the most common microorganisms found during cheese ripening. Streptococcus thermophilus (23/146) and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (20/146) were detected in high levels up to 20 days, and then gradually reduced. Enterococcus faecium (29/146) was found in all manufacturing and ripening stages.
TI  - Feasibility studies to control acute diarrhoea in children by feeding fermented milk preparations Actimel and Indian Dahi.
AB  - The aim of this work was to study feasibility of diarrhoea control in children (6 months to 5 y of age) by feeding fermented milk preparations. The design used was a randomized controlled clinical trial and the study was carried out at the Delhi University College Hospital providing tertiary care, and a nearby community centre Nand Nagri, a resettlement colony in East Delhi. Children suffering from acute diarrhoea (75 patients from the hospital and 75 from the community) were allocated to three groups by double-blind technique. Group 1 was given a fermented milk, Actimel, containing 10(8) of each Lactobacillus casei DN-114001, Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus per gram. Group 2 was given Indian Dahi (Lf 40) containing 10(8) of each Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus lactis cremoris and Leuconostac mesenteroides cremoris per gram. Group 3 was given ultra-heat-treated yoghurt preparation (no live bacteria). Actimel was also used as a starter to prepare the curd in order to study the preventive effect of diarrhoea in children in a community. In the hospital study Indian Dahi and Actimel administration reduced mean duration of diarrhoea by 0.3 and 0.6 day (P<0.001), respectively. The corresponding figures in the community study were 0.2 and 0.5 day (P<0.05), respectively. The families using Actimel as a starter showed a reduction in diarrhoeal morbidity episodes by 40% of the children tested in a 3 month follow-up. In conclusion, Actimel, fermented milk containing Lactobacillus casei DN-114001, and Indian Dahi can significantly reduce the duration of diarrhoea in children; the former preparation being superior.
TI  - Interaction of lactic acid bacteria with the gut immune system.
AB  - Health claims of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) used in functional foods and pharmaceutical preparations are based on the capacity of these microorganisms to stimulate the host immune system. In this study, the antigenic effect of LAB (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus) on the gut immune system of BALB/c mice was evaluated. A dose-dependent increase of the Bcl2 protein was observed with all LAB assayed. Furthermore, the analysis of cytokine-producing cells in the lamina propria of gut showed that TNFalpha and INFgamma values, determined in macrophages cultured from Peyer patches, were enhanced for all the LAB assayed. An important increase of interleukins IL-10 and IL-4 was observed mainly in mice fed with Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus or Lactobacillus casei, while a significant induction of IL-2 and IL-12 was only observed with L. acidophilus (P<0.01). These effects were dose dependent. The role of produced cytokines in the balance Th1/Th2 was determined by a systemic antibody response against parenterally injected ovoalbumin. L. casei, L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and L. acidophilus enhanced the IgG1 response favouring Th2 balance, while L. acidophilus also increased the IgG2a response inducing Th1 balance. S. thermophilus did not influence the balance Th1/Th2. Our studies showed that lactic acid bacteria induce distinct mucosal cytokine profiles showing different adjuvant capacity among them. Thus, selection of probiotic strain with immunological properties must be well defined to influence cytokine expression that favour the claimed immune response.
TI  - Effect of bifidobacterium Bb12 with or without Streptococcus thermophilus supplemented formula on nutritional status.
AB  - Acute diarrhea is a common cause of infant morbidity and mortality. Probiotic supplemented infant formula is one of the effective methods for prevention of rotavirus diarrhea. Other benefits of the probiotics supplemented formula were evaluated by monitoring the growth of the children. A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was done in 148 children aged 6-36 months. They were divided into 3 groups: the Bb12 group, 51 children received infant formula with Bifidobacteria Bb12 supplement; the Bb12+ST group, 54 children received infant formula with Bb12 and Streptococcus thermophilus supplement; and the control group, 43 children received infant formula without supplement. The mean weight Z-score according to WHO reference standard of the Bbl2 group was -1.8 +/- 0.12, the Bb12+ST group was -1.4 +/- 0.11 and the control group was -1.8 +/- 0.13 at entry. The mean weight Z-score of children after 6 month showed that the children in the Bbl2+ST group had the highest increase in weight which was increased from -1.4 +/- 0.11 to -0.9 +/- 0.12 compared to the Z-score of the Bb12 group which had increased from -1.8 +/- 0.12 to -1.2 +/- 0.13 and in the control group from -1.8 +/- 0.13 to -1.7 +/- 0.25. In terms of the mean height Z-score, the Bb12 group was -2.7 +/- 0.14 to -1.7 +/- 0.16 which was higher than the Bb12+ST group (- 2.2 +/- 0.13 to -1.7 +/- 0.13) but was not different from the control group. However, the mean weight/height Z-score of the Bbl2+ST group had approached the reference standard (Bb12 group -0.1 +/- 0.11 to -0.1 +/- 0.13, Bb12+ST group -0.1 +/- 0.10 to 0.3 +/- 0.17, control group -0.4 +/- 0.12 to -0.1 +/- 0.16). Data showed that children who received the probiotics supplement formula had better growth during the 6 month period.
TI  - Ingested probiotics reduce nasal colonization with pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-hemolytic streptococci).
AB  - BACKGROUND: As a bacterial reservoir, the nose may harbor potentially pathogenic  bacteria (PPB: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and Haemophilus influenzae). In patients carrying PPB, antiseptic regimens could be crucial for infection control after major operations on or injuries of the head, nasal sinuses, or lungs. Such regimens may also be important for diabetic patients and persons receiving hemodialysis, in intensive care units, or with impaired immunity due to various other causes. OBJECTIVE: We tested a possible effect of the ingestion of probiotics on the bacterial flora of the nose. DESIGN: In an open, prospective trial, 209 volunteers were randomly assigned to consume either a probiotic, fermented milk drink [65 mL with Lactobacillus GG (ATCC 53103), Bifidobacterium sp B420, Lactobacillus acidophilus 145, and Streptococcus thermophilus; n = 108] or standard yogurt (180 g; n = 101) daily for 3 wk. Nasal microbial flora were analyzed on days 1, 21, and 28. The microbial examination was blinded to the source of the samples. RESULTS: We found a significant reduction (19%; P < 0.001) in the occurrence of nasal PPB in the group who consumed the probiotic drink but not in the group who consumed yogurt. The effect was mainly on gram-positive bacteria, which decreased significantly (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that regular intake of probiotics can reduce PPB in the upper respiratory tract. The results also indicate a linkage of the lymphoid tissue between the gut and the upper respiratory tract.
TI  - [Comparison of genomes in Streptococcus thermophilus strains of different origins].
AB  - According to DNA hybridization data, thermophilic streptococci used in Russia as  starters in the dairy industry are divided into 6 different genomovars, with a degree of DNA homology not exceeding 20-50%. The analysis of genomes from these genomovars using SmaI restriction endonuclease and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed a wide variability of the genome size. In some strains, the genome size considerably exceeded 2000 kbp. Most of the strains studied contained plasmids about 120 kbp in size.
TI  - Applaying of high pressure to yoghurt preservation.
AB  - Effects of the high pressure treatment in the range of 200 - 1000 MPa/15 min., at the room temperature, on survivability of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus was investigated. Sensorial characteristics of yoghurt was conducted by a panel of experts. Influence of yoghurt acidity on the effect of pressurization was also determined. In the experiment, we also attempted to extend shelf-life of yoghurt, subjecting it to the pressure of 550 MPa/15 min. Pressure treated yoghurt was stored for 4-weeks at room and refrigerated temperature; every seven days microbial number, acidity and sensory attributes of the beverage was determined. Addition of fruit jam on the effect of pressurization was also checked. Survivability of microorganisms depends on the value of pressure used in the experiment. The research displayed that yoghurt acidity did not influence the effect of pressurization. During 4-weeks of storage, yoghurt processed at 550 MPa maintained its beneficial characteristics longer compared to the non-pressurized one. Addition of fruit jam beneficially affected consistency of the pressure treated yoghurt. The conducted studies showed that there was possibility of preserving yoghurt by the method of high pressures. Thus, to preserve yoghurt, the complete inactivation of microflora is not necessary.
TI  - Isolation, characterisation and identification of lactic acid bacteria from bushera: a Ugandan traditional fermented beverage.
AB  - One hundred and thirteen strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were selected from 351 isolates from 15 samples of traditionally fermented household bushera from Uganda and also from laboratory-prepared bushera. Isolates were phenotypically characterised by their ability to ferment 49 carbohydrates using API 50 CHL kits and additional biochemical tests. Coliforms, yeasts and LAB were enumerated in bushera. The pH, volatile organic compounds and organic acids were also determined. The LAB counts in household bushera varied between 7.1 and 9.4 log cfu ml(-1). The coliform counts varied between < 1 and 5.2 log cfu ml(-1). The pH of bushera ranged from 3.7 to 4.5. Ethanol (max, 0.27%) was the major volatile organic compound while lactic acid (max, 0.52%) was identified as the dominant organic acid in household bushera. The initial numbers of LAB and coliforms in laboratory-fermented bushera were similar; however, the LAB numbers increased faster during the first 24 h. LAB counts increased from 5.5 to 9.0 log cfu ml(-1) during the laboratory fermentation. Coliform counts increased from 5.9 to 7.8 log cfu ml(-1) at 24 h, but after 48 h, counts were less 4 log cfu ml(-1). Yeasts increased from 4.3 to 7.7 log cfu ml(-1) at 48 h, but thereafter decreased slightly. The pH declined from 7.0 to around 4.0. Lactic acid and ethanol increased from zero to 0.75% and 0.20%, respectively. Lactic acid bacteria isolated from household bushera belonged to Lactobacillus, Streptococcus and Enterococcus genera. Tentatively, Lactobacillus isolates were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum, L. paracasei subsp. paracasei, L. fermentum, L. brevis and L. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii. Streptococcus thermophilus strains were also identified in household bushera. LAB isolated from bushera produced in the laboratory belonged to five genera (Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, Lactobacillus, Weissella and Enterococcus. Eight isolates were able to produce acid from starch and were identified as Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (four strains), Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (one strain), Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum (one strain), Weissella confusa (one strain) and L. plantarum (one strain).
TI  - Proteolytic specificity of Lactobacillus delbrueckli subsp. bulgaricus influences functional properties of mozzarella cheese.
AB  - Low-moisture part-skim Mozzarella cheeses were manufactured from 2% fat milk and  aged for 21 d. Treatments included cheeses made with one of three different strains of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus in combination with a single strain of Streptococcus thermophilus. A fourth, control treatment consisted of cheeses made with only S. thermophilus. Although total proteolytic ability of these strains, as indicated by the o-phthaldialdehyde analysis, was similar in each of the three strains of L. bulgaricus, these strains exhibited different proteolytic specificities toward the peptide, alpha(s1)-CN (f 1-23). On the basis of their alpha(s1)-CN (f 1-23) cleavage patterns and a previously described classification, these strains were assigned to the groups I, III, and V. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of lactobacilli proteolytic systems, based on specificity toward alpha(s1)-CN (f 1-23), on functionality of part-skim Mozzarella cheese. Moisture, fat, protein, salt-in-moisture, and moisture in nonfat substances content of cheeses made with groups I, III, and V strain were similar. Control cheese had a lower moisture content than did other treatments. Significant differences were observed in functional properties between cheeses manufactured using groups III and V strains. Cheeses made with groups I and III strains were similar in their meltability, hardness, cohesiveness, melt strength, and stretch quality. Meltability and cohesiveness increased with age, while melt strength and stretch quality decreased with age for all cheeses. Additionally, HPLC showed that total peak areas of water-soluble peptides derived from cleavage of alpha(s1)-CN (f 1-23) by different strains of lactobacilli could be highly correlated to meltability and stretch characteristics of cheeses made with those strains.
TI  - Binding of free bile acids by cells of yogurt starter culture bacteria.
AB  - Several strains of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus, which produced exocellular polysaccharides (EPS), varied in the amount produced. The streptococci tended to produce the most EPS per milliliter of culture; however, when compared on the basis of amounts per 10(7) cfu, the lactobacilli produced the most. Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus strains Lb-18 and Lb-10442 and S. thermophilus St-143 produced significantly larger amounts per 107 cfu than did other strains tested. These three cultures plus two strains of the streptococci that produced the greatest amounts of EPS per ml of culture were tested for the ability to bind bile acids from laboratory media. The two cultures of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (Lb-18 and Lb-10442) bound significantly higher amounts of cholic acid than did the three strains of streptococci. These two cultures of lactobacilli bound up to 15.3% of the cholic acid present in laboratory media, up to 452 microg/mg of EPS and 2.9 microg/10(7) cfu. None of the cultures tested in this study were able to bind the conjugated bile acid, glycocholic acid.
TI  - PCR detection of Bifidobacterium strains and Streptococcus thermophilus in feces  of human subjects after oral bacteriotherapy and yogurt consumption.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus, Bifidobacterium infantis Y1 and Bifidobacterium breve Y8 strains were identified and enumerated by PCR assay in human fecal samples after intake of the pharmaceutical preparation VSL-3 or yogurt. ThI/ThII primer set, specific for S. thermophilus, was selected testing its specificity against several strains of enterococci, streptococci and other genera colonizing the human intestine. A culture-independent PCR protocol, developed in this study, allowed to directly detect and enumerate S. thermophilus in human feces, excluding culture-based techniques or time consuming DNA isolation and purification procedures. Intestinal persistence of S. thermophilus was studied in feces of 10 healthy subjects given VSL-3 or yogurt. Streptococcal population was detected after 3 days of administration and persisted for 6 days after the treatment suspension. In the same trial, the colonization kinetics of B. infantis Y1 and B. breve Y8 were studied by amplification of colonies with the strain-specific primer sets InfY-BV.L/R and BreY-BV.R/L, showing a host-dependent transient colonization behaviour. PCR analysis of feces from 10 patients affected by inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and treated with VSL-3 for 2 months showed a colonization pattern of S. thermophilus, B. infantis Y1 and B. breve Y8 similar to that observed with the healthy subjects.
TI  - DNA-binding activity of the Streptococcus thermophilus phage Sfi21 repressor.
AB  - The cloned Streptococcus thermophilus phage Sfi21 repressor open reading frame (orf) 127 gp protects a cell against superinfection with the homologous temperate, but not against virulent phages. As demonstrated by DNase protection assay and gel shift experiments, the repressor binds to a 25-bp operator site located upstream of the repressor gene. A second sequence-related operator was identified 265 bp apart at the 3'-end of orf 75, the topological equivalent of a cro repressor gene. The replacement of a bp at the middle or at the right side of the operator decreased substantially the affinity of the repressor for the operator. In gel shift assays, the 75 gp did not bind DNA from the genetic switch region. However, when increasing amounts of orf 75 gp containing cell extracts were added to orf 127 gp containing cell extracts, the repressor could no longer bind its operator site.
TI  - Identification of a phosphofructokinase-encoding gene from Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ1205--a novel link between carbon metabolism and gene regulation?
AB  - In order to isolate genes encoding so-called Two-Component Regulatory Systems from the lactic acid bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus, a cloning strategy was employed based on suppression of the alkaline phosphatase-negative phenotype displayed by the Escherichia coli strain ANCC22. Several suppressing clones were obtained which were shown to produce alkaline phosphatase activity. Sequence analysis of four of these clones revealed the presence of overlapping DNA inserts representing two ORFs, designated pfkT and pykT, whose deduced protein products exhibit significant similarity to phosphofructokinases and pyruvate kinases, respectively, from a variety of bacteria. A plasmid bearing pfkT was shown to complement a phosphofructokinase-negative mutant of E. coli, showing that this gene indeed specifies phosphofructokinase activity. It was shown that suppression of the alkaline phosphatase-negative phenotype of E. coli ANCC22 due to the presence of pfkT is caused by modulation of the intracellular level of acetyl phosphate.
TI  - Distribution and stability of aflatoxin M1 during production and storage of yoghurt.
AB  - Yoghurt from cow's milk artificially contaminated with aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) at levels of 0.050 and 0.100 g l(-1) was fermented to reach pHs 4.0 and 4.6. Yoghurt fermented to pH 4.6 was also used for preparing strained yoghurt. Yoghurts were stored at 4 degrees C for up to 4 weeks. Analysis of AFM1 in milk, yoghurt, strained yoghurt and yoghurt whey was carried out using immunoaffinity column extraction and liquid chromatography coupled with fluorometric detection. AFM1 levels in yoghurt samples showed a significant decrease (p < 0.01) compared with those initially added to milk. Growth of culture lactic acid bacteria was not affected in the AFM1 contaminated yoghurts, with the exception of Streptococcus thermophilus that showed a significantly (p < 0.01) lower increase in the yoghurt containing the toxin at high concentration. Following fermentation, AFM1 was significantly lower (p < 0.01) in yoghurts with pH 4.0 than in yoghurts with pH 4.6 at both contamination levels. During refrigerated storage, AFM1 was rather more stable in yoghurts with pH 4.6 than with pH 4.0. The percentage loss of the initial amount of AFM1 in milk was estimated at about 13 and 22% by the end of the fermentation, and 16 and 34% by the end of storage for yoghurts with pHs 4.6 and 4.0, respectively. The percentage distribution ratio of AFM1 in strained yoghurt/yoghurt whey of the initial toxin present in the yoghurt was about 90/10 and 87/13 for the lower and the higher contamination levels, respectively.
TI  - AbiA, a lactococcal abortive infection mechanism functioning in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The lactococcal abortive infection mechanisms AbiA and AbiG were introduced into  Streptococcus thermophilus 4035, and a range of phages capable of infecting this host were examined for sensitivity to these mechanisms. AbiA proved effective against six phages when examined at a growth temperature of 30 degrees C but had no effect on any of the phages when tested at 37 or 42 degrees C. AbiG failed to affect any of the S. thermophilus phages at 30, 37, or 42 degrees C.
TI  - Exopolysaccharides produced by lactic acid bacteria of kefir grains.
AB  - A Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus HP1 strain with high exopolysaccharide activity was selected from among 40 strains of lactic acid bacteria, isolated from kefir grains. By associating the Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus HP1 strain with Streptococcus thermophilus T15, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis C15, Lactobacillus helveticus MP12, and Sacharomyces cerevisiae A13, a kefir starter was formed. The associated cultivation of the lactobacteria and yeast had a positive effect on the exopolysaccharide activity of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus HP1. The maximum exopolysaccharide concentration of the starter culture exceeded the one by the Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus HP1 monoculture by approximately 1.7 times, and the time needed to reach the maximum concentration (824.3 mg exopolysacharides/l) was shortened by 6 h. The monomer composition of the exopolysaccharides from the kefir starter culture was represented by glucose and galactose in a 1.0:0.94 ratio, which proves that the polymer synthesized is kefiran.
TI  - Transcription analysis of Streptococcus thermophilus phages in the lysogenic state.
AB  - The transcription of prophage genes was studied in two lysogenic Streptococcus thermophilus cells by Northern blot and primer-extension experiments. In the lysogen containing the cos-site phage Sfi21 only two gene regions of the prophage were transcribed. Within the lysogeny module an 1.6-kb-long mRNA started at the promoter of the phage repressor gene and covered also the next two genes, including a superinfection exclusion (sie) gene. A second, quantitatively more prominent 1-kb-long transcript was initiated at the promoter of the sie gene. Another prophage transcript of 1.6-kb length covered a group of genes without database matches that were located between the lysin gene and the right attachment site. The rest of the prophage genome was transcriptionally silent. A very similar transcription pattern was observed for a S. thermophilus lysogen containing the pac-site phage O1205 as a prophage. Prophages from pathogenic streptococci encode virulence genes downstream of the lysin gene. We speculate that temperate phages from lactic streptococci also encode nonessential phage genes ("lysogenic conversion genes") in this region that increase the ecological fitness of the lysogen to further their own evolutionary success. A comparative genome analysis revealed that many temperate phages from low GC content Gram-positive bacteria encode a variable number of genes in that region and none was linked to known phage-related function. Prophages from pathogenic streptococci encode toxin genes in this region. In accordance with theoretical predictions on prophage-host genome interactions a prophage remnant was detected in S. thermophilus that had lost most of the prophage DNA while transcribed prophage genes were spared from the deletion process.
TI  - Cell-wall proteinases PrtS and PrtB have a different role in Streptococcus thermophilus/Lactobacillus bulgaricus mixed cultures in milk.
AB  - The manufacture of yoghurt relies on the simultaneous utilization of two starters: Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (Lb. bulgaricus). A protocooperation usually takes place between the two species, which often results in enhanced milk acidification and aroma formation compared to pure cultures. Cell-wall proteinases of Lactococcus lactis and lactobacilli have been shown to be essential to growth in milk in pure cultures. In this study, the role of proteinases PrtS from S. thermophilus and PrtB from Lb. bulgaricus in bacterial growth in milk was evaluated; a negative mutant for the prtS gene of S. thermophilus CNRZ 385 was constructed for this purpose. Pure cultures of S. thermophilus CNRZ 385 and its PrtS-negative mutant were made in milk as well as mixed cultures of S. thermophilus and Lb. bulgaricus: S. thermophilus CNRZ 385 or its PrtS-negative mutant was associated with several strains of Lb. bulgaricus, including a PrtB-negative strain. The pH and growth of bacterial populations of the resulting mixed cultures were followed, and the Lactobacillus strain was found to influence both the extent of the benefit of Lb. bulgaricus/S. thermophilus association on milk acidification and the magnitude of S. thermophilus population dominance at the end of fermentation. In all mixed cultures, the sequential growth of S. thermophilus then of Lb. bulgarius and finally of both bacteria was observed. Although proteinase PrtS was essential to S. thermophilus growth in milk in pure culture, it had no effect on bacterial growth and thus on the final pH of mixed cultures in the presence of PrtB. In contrast, proteinase PrtB was necessary for the growth of S. thermophilus, and its absence resulted in a higher final pH. From these results, a model of growth of both bacteria in mixed cultures in milk is proposed.
TI  - Synthesis and utilisation of folate by yoghurt starter cultures and probiotic bacteria.
AB  - Thirty-two bacterial isolates from species commonly used in yoghurts and fermented milks were examined for their ability to synthesise or utilise folate during fermentation of skim milk. The organisms examined included the traditional yoghurt starter cultures, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus, and probiotic lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, and Enterococcus faecium. Folate was synthesised by S. thermophilus, bifidobacteria, and E. faecium. S. thermophilus was the dominant producer, elevating folate levels in skim milk from 11.5 ng g(-1) to between 40 and 50 ng g(-1). Generally, lactobacilli depleted the available folate in the skim milk. Fermentations with mixed cultures showed that folate production and utilisation by the cultures was additive. Fermentations using a combination of Bifidobacterium animalis and S. thermophilus resulted in a six-fold increase in folate concentration. Although increased folate levels in yoghurts and fermented milks are possible through judicious selection of inoculum species, the folate levels remain relatively low in terms of recommended daily allowance.
TI  - Cloning vectors for Streptococcus thermophilus derived from a native plasmid.
AB  - A 3.5-kb native plasmid (pND103) was identified in Streptococcus thermophilus ST2-1. Preliminary sequence analysis indicated that pND103 belongs to group I S. thermophilus plasmids. A region of approximately 2 kb appears to contain three components: a plus origin of replication (ori) typical of plasmids that replicate via rolling circle replication; a gene encoding a replication protein (rep); and a gene encoding a small heat shock protein (hsp). pND103 was then used to construct S. thermophilus/Escherichia coli hybrid cloning vectors by ligating different portions of pND103 to an origin-probe vector (pND330) composed of pUC19 and a Gram-positive erythromycin resistance gene. The shuttle vectors (pND913, pND914 and pND915) were successfully introduced back into plasmid-free S. thermophilus ST3-1 as well as to Lactococcus lactis LM0230 and E. coli JM109. Segregational and structural stability study indicated that these vectors can be maintained in these hosts. The results indicated that pND913, pND914 and pND915 are potential shuttle cloning vectors for S. thermophilus.
TI  - Characterization of the exopolysaccharide produced by Streptococcus thermophilus  8S containing an open chain nononic acid.
AB  - The exopolysaccharide produced by Streptococcus thermophilus 8S in reconstituted  skimmed milk is a heteropolysaccharide containing d-galactose, d-glucose, d-ribose, and N-acetyl-d-galactosamine in a molar ratio of 2 : 1 : 1 : 1. Furthermore, the polysaccharide contains one equivalent of a novel open chain nononic acid constituent, 3,9-dideoxy-d-threo-d-altro-nononic acid, ether-linked via C-2 to C-6 of an additional d-glucose per repeating unit. Methylation analysis and 1D/2D NMR studies (1H and 13C) performed on the native polysaccharide, and mass spectrometric and NMR analyses of the oligosaccharide obtained from the polysaccharide by de-N-acetylation followed by deamination and reduction demonstrated the 'hepta'saccharide repeating unit to be: -->4)-alpha-D-Galp-(1-->2)-beta-D-Ribf-(1-->4)-beta-D-Galp-(1-->4)-beta-D-Glcp-(1 --7')-Sub-(1-->4)-beta-D-GalpNAc-(1--> in which Sug is 6-O-(3',9'-dideoxy-d-threo-d-altro-nononic acid-2'-yl)-alpha-d-glucopyranose.
TI  - Production of pyroglutamic acid by thermophilic lactic acid bacteria in hard-cooked mini-cheeses.
AB  - Pyroglutamic acid is present in high amounts (0.5g/ 100g) in many cheese varieties-and particularly in extensively ripened Italian cheeses such as Grana Padano and Parmigiano Reggiano. An in vivo model system for cooked mini-cheese production and ripening acceleration was set up to demonstrate the ability of thermophilic lactic acid bacteria, used as a starter, to produce pyroglutamic acid (pGlu). In mini-cheeses stored at 38 and 30 degrees C for up to 45 d, all starters tested produced different amounts of pGlu. In descending order of pGlu production, the bacteria analyzed were: Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis. Evidence for the presence of glutamine to pGlu cyclase activity in lactic acid bacteria was provided. Cell lysates obtained from cultures of L. helveticus, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, and S. thermophilus showed the ability to cyclize glutamine to pGlu, resulting in processing yields from 1.4 to 30.3%, depending on the subspecies. Formation of pGlu from free glutamine appeared to be similar to that observed using a glutamine-glutamine dipeptide substrate. Under the experimental conditions applied, pGlu aminopeptidase activity was only detected in L. helveticus. Thus, pGlu formation in long-ripened cooked cheese may depend on the activity of thermophilic lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Effect of milk base and starter culture on acidification, texture, and probiotic  cell counts in fermented milk processing.
AB  - In the present work, the compared effect of milk base and starter culture on acidification, texture, growth, and stability of probiotic bacteria in fermented milk processing, was studied. Two strains of probiotic bacteria were used, Lactobacillus acidophilus LA5 and L. rhamnosus LR35, with two starter cultures. One starter culture consisted only of Streptococcus thermophilus ST7 (single starter culture); the other was a yogurt mixed culture with S. thermophilus ST7 and L. bulgaricus LB12 (mixed starter culture). For the milk base preparation, four commercial dairy ingredients were tested (two milk protein concentrates and two casein hydrolysates). The resulting fermented milks were compared to those obtained with control milk (without enrichment) and milk added with skim milk powder. The performance of the two probiotic strains were opposite. L. acidophilus LA5 grew well on milk but showed a poor stability during storage. L. rhamnosus LR35 grew weakly on milk but was remarkably stable during storage. With the strains tested in this study, the use of the single starter culture and the addition of casein hydrolysate gave the best probiotic cell counts. The fermentation time was of about 11 h, and the probiotic level after five weeks of storage was greater than 106 cfu/ml for L. acidophilus LA5 and 10(7) cfu/ml for L. rhamnosus LR35. However, an optimization of the level of casein hydrolysate added to milk base has to be done, in order to improve texture and flavor when using this dairy ingredient.
TI  - Metabolic engineering of acetaldehyde production by Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The process of acetaldehyde formation by the yogurt bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus is described in this paper. Attention was focused on one specific reaction for acetaldehyde formation catalyzed by serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), encoded by the glyA gene. In S. thermophilus, SHMT also possesses threonine aldolase (TA) activity, the interconversion of threonine into glycine and acetaldehyde. In this work, several wild-type S. thermophilus strains were screened for acetaldehyde production in the presence and absence of L-threonine. Supplementation of the growth medium with L-threonine led to an increase in acetaldehyde production. Furthermore, acetaldehyde formation during fermentation could be correlated to the TA activity of SHMT. To study the physiological role of SHMT, a glyA mutant was constructed by gene disruption. Inactivation of glyA resulted in a severe reduction in TA activity and complete loss of acetaldehyde formation during fermentation. Subsequently, an S. thermophilus strain was constructed in which the glyA gene was cloned under the control of a strong promoter (P(LacA)). When this strain was used for fermentation, an increase in TA activity and in acetaldehyde and folic acid production was observed. These results show that, in S. thermophilus, SHMT, displaying TA activity, constitutes the main pathway for acetaldehyde formation under our experimental conditions. These findings can be used to control and improve acetaldehyde production in fermented (dairy) products with S. thermophilus as starter culture.
TI  - Molecular characterization of cadmium resistance in Streptococcus thermophilus strain 4134: an example of lateral gene transfer.
AB  - Two genes (cadC(St) and cadA(St) [subscript St represents Streptococcus thermophilus]), located on the chromosome of S. thermophilus 4134, were shown to constitute a cadmium/zinc resistance cassette. The genes seem to be organized in an operon, and their transcription is cadmium dependent in vivo. The proposed product of the cadA open reading frame (CadA(St)) is highly similar to P-type cadmium efflux ATPases, whereas the predicted protein encoded by cadC(St) (CadC(St)) shows high similarity to ArsR-type regulatory proteins. The observed homologies and G+C content of this cassette and surrounding regions suggest that this DNA was derived from Lactococcus lactis and may have been introduced relatively recently into the S. thermophilus 4134 genome by a lateral gene transfer event. The complete cassette confers cadmium and zinc resistance to both S. thermophilus and L. lactis, but expression of cadA(St) alone is sufficient to give resistance. By using electrophoretic mobility shift assays it was shown that the CadC(St) protein is a DNA binding protein that binds specifically to its own promoter region, possibly to two copies of an inverted repeat, and that this CadC(St)-DNA interaction is lost in the presence of cadmium. Using lacZ fusion constructs it was shown that the cadmium-dependent expression of CadA(St) is mediated by the negative regulator CadC(St). A model for the regulation of the expression of cadmium resistance in S. thermophilus is discussed.
TI  - Characterization of the melA locus for alpha-galactosidase in Lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  - Alpha-galactosides are abundant sugars in legumes such as soy. Because of the lack of alpha-galactosidase (alpha-Gal) in the digestive tract, humans are unable to digest these sugars, which consequently induce flatulence. To develop the consumption of the otherwise highly nutritional soy products, the use of exogenous alpha-Gal is promising. In this framework, we characterized the melA gene for alpha-Gal in Lactobacillus plantarum. The melA gene encodes a cytoplasmic 84-kDa protein whose enzymatically active form occurs as oligomers. The melA gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, yielding an active alpha-Gal. We show that melA is transcribed from its own promoter, yielding a monocistronic mRNA, and that it is regulated at the transcriptional level, i.e., it is induced by melibiose but is not totally repressed by glucose. Posttranscriptional regulation by the carbon source could also occur. Upstream of melA, a putative galactoside transporter, designated RafP, was identified that shows high homology to LacS, the unique transporter for both alpha- and beta-galactosides in Streptococcus thermophilus. rafP is also expressed as a monocistronic mRNA. Downstream of melA, the lacL and lacM genes were identified that encode a heterodimeric beta-galactosidase. A putative galM gene identified in the same cluster suggests the presence of a galactose operon. These results indicate that the genes involved in galactoside catabolism are clustered in L. plantarum ATCC 8014. This first genetic characterization of melA and of its putative associated transporter, rafP, in a lactobacillus opens doors to various applications both in the manufacture of soy-derived products and in probiotic and nutraceutical issues.
TI  - Genetic diversity in Swiss cheese starter cultures assessed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis and arbitrarily primed PCR.
AB  - AIMS: To assess intraspecific genetic heterogeneity among commercial Swiss cheese starter culture strains of Lactobacillus helveticus, Streptococcus thermophilus and Propionibacterium freudenreichii and to compare the efficacy of two genetic typing methods. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two genetic typing methods, pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and arbitrarily primed PCR (AP-PCR), were used. Nine Strep. thermophilus strains revealed eight PFGE and five AP-PCR genotypes. Seventeen Lactobacillus strains yielded 16 and five genotypes by PFGE and AP-PCR, respectively. Eleven Propionibacterium strains yielded 10 PFGE genotypes. Cluster analysis of PFGE profiles generated similarity coefficients for Strep. thermophilus, Lact. helveticus and Prop. freudenreichii strains of 29.5%, 60.3%, and 30.5%, respectively. Milk acidification rates for Strep. thermophilus and Lact. helveticus were determined. CONCLUSIONS: Pulsed field gel electrophoresis is more discriminatory than AP-PCR. The Lact. helveticus group is more homogeneous than the other species examined. Strains with > 87% similarity by PFGE consistently had the same acidification rate and AP-PCR profile. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Bacterial strains sold for Swiss cheese manufacture in the United States are genetically diverse. Clustering of genetically related bacteria may be useful in identifying new strains with industrially relevant traits.
TI  - The ICESt1 element of Streptococcus thermophilus belongs to a large family of integrative and conjugative elements that exchange modules and change their specificity of integration.
AB  - The 34,734-bp element ICESt1 from Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ368 is site-specifically integrated into the 3(') end of the gene fda. ICESt1 encodes integrative functions and putative transfer functions. Six proteins of the putative conjugative system of ICESt1 are related to those encoded by the conjugative transposon Tn916 from Enterococcus faecalis. A comparison of these proteins with those encoded by the complete or partial genome sequences of various low G+C bacteria including Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium difficile, E. faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus mutans revealed the presence of numerous putative site-specific integrative conjugative elements and/or conjugative transposons within these genomes. Sequence comparisons revealed that these elements possess a modular structure and that exchanges of unrelated or distantly related modules and genes have occurred between these elements, and also plasmids and prophages. These exchanges have probably led to modifications in the site specificity of integration of these elements. Therefore, a distinction between low specificity integrative conjugative elements (i.e., conjugative transposons) and site-specific integrative conjugative elements does not appear to be relevant. We propose to call all the conjugative elements that excise by site-specific recombination and integrate by recombination between a specific site of a circular intermediate and another site, "Integrative and Conjugative Elements" (ICEs), irrespective of the integration specificity.
TI  - Survival of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in traditional African yoghurt fermentation.
AB  - Growth and survival of a nontoxigenic strain of Escherichia coli O157:H7 (ATCC 43888) was determined in traditionally fermented pasteurized milk. Preheated milk was inoculated with 1% (v/v) of a mixed culture of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (NCIMB 11778) and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus (NCIMB 110368) and incubated at 25, 30, 37 or 43 degrees C for 24 h. E. coli O157:H7 (10(5) CFU/ml) were introduced into the milk pre- and post-fermentation. Fermented milk samples were subsequently stored at either 4 degrees C (refrigerator temperature) or 25 degrees C (to mimic African ambient temperature) for 5 days. After 24 h of fermentation, the pH of the samples fermented at the higher temperatures of 37-43 degrees C decreased from 6.8 to 4.4-4.0 ( +/- 0.2) whereas at the lower temperature of 25 degrees C, the pH decreased to pH 5.0 +/- 0.1. During this period, viable counts for E. coli O157:H7 increased from 10(5) to 10(8) - 10(9) CFU/ml except in milk fermented at 43 degrees C wherein viability declined to 10(4) CFU/ml. In fermented (25-30 degrees C) milk stored at 4 degrees C for 5 days, E. coli O157:H7 viability decreased from 10(8-9) to 10(6-7) CFU/ml whereas milk fermented at 43 degrees C resulted in loss of detectable cells. In contrast, storage of fermented milk samples at 25 degrees C for 5 days eventually resulted in complete loss of viability irrespective of fermentation temperature. Stationary phase E. coli O157:H7 inoculated post-fermentation (25 and 43 degrees C) survived during 4 degrees C storage, but not 25 degrees C storage. Fermentation temperature and subsequent storage temperature are critical to the growth and survival of E. coli O157:H7 in traditional fermented products involving yoghurt starter cultures.
TI  - Thermophilic lactic acid bacteria phages isolated from Argentinian dairy industries.
AB  - Sixty-one natural phages (59 of Streptococcus thermophilus and 2 of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus) were isolated from Argentinian dairy plants from November 1994 to July 2000. Specifically, 17 yogurt samples (18% of all samples) and 26 cheese samples (79%) contained phages lytic to S. thermophilus strains. The number of viral particles found in samples ranged from 10(2) to 10(9) PFU/ml. The phages belonged to Bradley's group B or the Siphoviridae family (morphotype B1). They showed high burst size values and remarkably short latent periods. The results of this study show that phages were found more frequently in cheesemaking processes than in yogurt-making processes. The commercial streptococcus strains appeared to propagate more phages, whereas the natural strains propagated fewer phage strains. These results suggest that the naturally occurring cultures are inherently more phage resistant.
TI  - The dilemma of phage taxonomy illustrated by comparative genomics of Sfi21-like Siphoviridae in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The complete genome sequences of two dairy phages, Streptococcus thermophilus phage 7201 and Lactobacillus casei phage A2, are reported. Comparative genomics reveals that both phages are members of the recently proposed Sfi21-like genus of Siphoviridae, a widely distributed phage type in low-GC-content gram-positive bacteria. Graded relatedness, the hallmark of evolving biological systems, was observed when different Sfi21-like phages were compared. Across the structural module, the graded relatedness was represented by a high level of DNA sequence similarity or protein sequence similarity, or a shared gene map in the absence of sequence relatedness. This varying range of relatedness was found within Sfi21-like phages from a single species as demonstrated by the different prophages harbored by Lactococcus lactis strain IL1403. A systematic dot plot analysis with 11 complete L. lactis phage genome sequences revealed a clear separation of all temperate phages from two classes of virulent phages. The temperate lactococcal phages share DNA sequence homology in a patchwise fashion over the nonstructural gene cluster. With respect to structural genes, four DNA homology groups could be defined within temperate L. lactis phages. Closely related structural modules for all four DNA homology groups were detected in phages from Streptococcus or Listeria, suggesting that they represent distinct evolutionary lineages that have not uniquely evolved in L. lactis. It seems reasonable to base phage taxonomy on data from comparative genomics. However, the peculiar modular nature of phage evolution creates ambiguities in the definition of phage taxa by comparative genomics. For example, depending on the module on which the classification is based, temperate lactococcal phages can be classified as a single phage species, as four distinct phage species, or as two if not three different phage genera. We propose to base phage taxonomy on comparative genomics of a single structural gene module (head or tail genes). This partially phylogeny-based taxonomical system still mirrors some aspects of the current International Committee on Taxonomy in Virology classification system. In this system the currently sequenced lactococcal phages would be grouped into five genera: c2-, sk1, Sfi11-, r1t-, and Sfi21-like phages.
TI  - Effect of medium composition and temperature and pH changes on exopolysaccharide  yields and stability during Streptococcus thermophilus LY03 fermentations.
AB  - To increase the exopolysaccharide (EPS) yields from Streptococcus thermophilus LY03 and to unravel the nature of the EPS degradation process, fermentation experiments were carried out with this strain in a customized MRS medium, using different additional carbohydrates or amino acids possibly related to growth and EPS production. No significant increase of the EPS yields or activities of the enzymes alpha-phosphoglucomutase, UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and UDP-galactose 4-epimerase that are correlated with EPS production, or of the activity of dTDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase involved in the rhamnose synthetic branch of EPS biosynthesis, was observed. The EPS monomer composition remained unchanged for all experiments. Fermentations with a sudden temperature increase or lowered pH were carried out as well to try to avoid EPS degradation upon prolonged fermentation. It was demonstrated that EPS degradation took place enzymatically. Incubations of purified high-molecular-mass EPS with cell-free culture supernatant or cell extracts showed its degradation by enzymes with an endo-activity. This glycohydrolytic activity probably encompasses several enzymes having a molecular mass lower than 50,000 and 10,000 Da, and seems to be rather stable at high temperature and low pH. These results contribute to a better understanding of the physiological and chemical factors influencing EPS production and degradation.
TI  - Physicochemical properties and bacterial resistance of biodegradable milk protein films containing agar and pectin.
AB  - Free-standing sterilized edible films based on milk proteins, namely calcium caseinate and whey protein isolate, and polysaccharides, namely pectin and agar, were developed. Cross-linking of the proteins was achieved by the combination of thermal and radiative treatments. Autoclaving pectin and agar prior to their addition to the protein solutions generated films with an improved (P < or = 0.05) puncture strength. The presence of proteins and pectin-agar in the film formulation enhanced (P < or = 0.05) the moisture barrier of the films by 18%. A strain of Streptococcus thermophilus was used to assess the biodegradability behavior of the cross-linked films. Microbiological counts and soluble nitrogen analysis confirmed the biodegradability property of the milk protein films containing autoclaved pectin and agar.
TI  - A novel open-chain nononic acid linked by an ether bond to glucose as a polysaccharide constituent.
AB  - A novel sugar constituent was isolated from the heteropolysaccharide excreted by  Streptococcus thermophilus 8 S when grown in skimmed milk. The structure and absolute configuration were determined by means of chemical analysis, mass spectrometry, NMR spectroscopy, along with molecular dynamics simulations, and was shown to be 6-O-(3',9'-dideoxy-D-threo-D-altro-nononic acid-2'-yl)-D-glucopyranose.
TI  - A PCR-based method for identification of lactobacilli at the genus level.
AB  - We developed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method for the identification of lactobacilli at the genus level. One specific primer, LbLMA1-rev, was designed by analysing similarities between the nucleotide sequence of the spacer between the 16S and 23S rRNA genes in a number of Lactobacillus strains. Amplification with LbLMA1-rev and R16-1, a universal primer, generated a PCR product for 23 Lactobacillus species. Electrophoresis did not reveal any discrete bands when Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Streptococcus thermophilus, Carnobacterium pissicola, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Weissella confusa, Enterococcus hirae, Staphylococcus aureus or Listeria monocytogenes DNA were used as template.
TI  - Alteration of cell morphology and viability in a recA mutant of Streptococcus thermophilus upon induction of heat shock and nutrient starvation.
AB  - We identified the recA gene of the moderately thermophilic bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus and investigated the role of its product in the adaptation to heat shock and nutrient starvation. Expression of recA was required for optimal viability and normal cell morphology upon induction of both stresses. Normal induction of GroEL and ClpL in a recA knock-out mutant suggests that the RecA role in heat shock and nutrient starvation response of S. thermophilus is independent from the intracellular accumulation of these stress-specific chaperones.
TI  - The evaluation of mixtures of yeast and potato extracts in growth media for biomass production of lactic cultures.
AB  - The effectiveness of yeast extracts (YE) and potato extracts (PE) to promote growth of seven lactic cultures was evaluated by automated spectrophotometry (AS). Two aspects of the growth curve were analysed: (1) maximum biomass obtained (using ODmax) and (2) highest specific growth rate mu(max)) Eleven lots from the same PE-manufacturing process were examined for lot-to-lot variability. The ODmax values of three of the seven strains were significantly affected by lot source, but mu(max) was not significantly affected. The growth of bacteria was systematically lower in base medium containing 100% PE than in base medium containing 100% YE for both ODmax or mu(max) data, which could be related to the lower content in nitrogen-based compounds in PE. In AS assays, highest OD values for Lactobacillus casei EQ28, Lactobacillus rhamnosus R-011, Lactobacillus plantarum EQ12, and Streptococcus thermophilus R-083 were obtained with a mixture of PE and YE. Fermentations (2 L) were also carried out to determine the accuracy of AS to predict biomass levels obtained under fermentation trials. In these fermentations, replacement of 50% YE with PE was shown to enable good growth of S. thermophilus. With L. rhamnosus R-011, a high correlation (R2 = 0.95) was found between ODmax data obtained in the AS assays and that of the 2-L bioreactor when the same growth medium was used for both series of fermentations. However, AS was not as efficient when industrial media were used for the bioreactor assays. The relationship was still good for ODmax between AS data and that of the bioreactor data with L. rhamnosus R-011 in industrial LBS medium (R2 = 0.87), but was very poor with the S. thermophilus R-083 on Rosell #43 industrial medium (R2 = 0.33). Since PE cost 40% less than YE, there are strong economic advantages in considering such a partial replacement of YE by PE.
TI  - Combined in-gel tryptic digestion and CNBr cleavage for the generation of peptide maps of an integral membrane protein with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.
AB  - A limitation of the in-gel approaches for the generation of peptides of membrane  proteins is the size and hydrophobicity of the fragments generated. For membrane proteins like the lactose transporter (LacS) of Streptococcus thermophilus, tryptic digestion or CNBr cleavage yields several hydrophobic fragments larger than 3.5 kDa. As a result, the sequence coverage of the membrane domain is low when the in-gel tryptic-digested or CNBr-cleaved fragments are analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS). The combination of tryptic digestion and subsequent CNBr cleavage on the same gel pieces containing LacS approximately doubled the coverage of the hydrophobic membrane domain compared to the individual cleavage methods, while the coverage of the soluble domain remained complete. The fragments formed are predominantly below m/z 2500, which allows accurate mass measurement.
TI  - Long-term consumption of fermented dairy products over 6 months increases HDL cholesterol.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Assessment of the hypocholesterolaemic effect of yoghurt supplemented  with Lactobacillus acidophilus 145 and Bifidobacterium longum 913 in women. DESIGN: The cross-over study consisted of three periods (7 weeks each): first period, control yoghurt for all 29 women; second period, probiotic yoghurt for 18 women, control yoghurt for 11 women; third period, the reverse of that in the second period. SETTING: Department of Nutritional Physiology, Institute of Nutritional Science, Friedrich Schiller University, Jena. SUBJECTS: Twenty-nine healthy women, aged 19-56 y. Fifteen of these were normocholesterolaemic and 14 women were hypercholesterolaemic. INTERVENTION: Yoghurt (300 g) daily containing 3.5% fat and starter cultures of Streptococcus thermophilus and L. lactis. Probiotic yoghurt was the control yoghurt enriched with L. acidophilus 145, B. longum 913 and 1% oligofructose (synbiotic). RESULTS: The mean serum concentration of total cholesterol and the LDL cholesterol was not influenced by the synbiotic (P>0.05). The HDL concentration increased significantly by 0.3 mmol/l (P=0.002). The ratio of LDL/HDL cholesterol decreased from 3.24 to 2.48 (P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The long-term daily consumption of 300 g yoghurt over a period of 21 weeks (control and synbiotic) increased the serum concentration of HDL cholesterol and lead to the desired improvement of the LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio.
TI  - Direct observation of bacterial exopolysaccharides in dairy products using confocal scanning laser microscopy.
AB  - The objective of this work was to develop a methodology for direct visualization  of bacterial exopolysaccharides (EPS) in fully hydrated dairy products. The new method involved staining EPS with wheat germ agglutinin labeled with Alexa fluor 488 or staining with concanavalin A 488. Samples were observed using confocal scanning laser microscopy. Distribution of EPS produced by Lactococcus lactis (CHCC 3367), a combination of Streptococcus thermophilus (CHCC 3534) and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (CHCC 769) and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus RR in milk was compared in stirred and unstirred fermented milk. The EPS and proteins were observed as distinct entities, with EPS present in the protein network pores. EPS was observed in greater amounts in milk fermented by the ropy L. lactis culture than in milk fermented by the less ropy strain of S. thermophilus. Stirring the fermented milk caused aggregation of EPS into more extended structures. The more ropy the culture, the longer and larger the strands formed during stirring. The method was also applied to Feta cheese made with an EPS-producing strain of S. thermophilus. EPS was observed in the cheese as thick sheets filling pores in the protein network.
TI  - Genetic diversity and technological properties of Streptococcus thermophilus strains isolated from dairy products.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the genetic diversity and the technological properties of 44 strains of Streptococcus thermophilus isolated from dairy products. Methods METHODS AND RESULTS: Strains were analysed for some relevant technological properties, i.e. exopolysaccharide (EPS) production, growth kinetic in skim milk medium, urease activity and galactose fermentation. The EPS production, determined by evaluating the colour of the colonies grown in ruthenium red milk agar, was observed in 50% of the analysed strains. Urease activity, determined by colorimetric and conductimetric methods, showed that 91% of the isolates, all except four, could hydrolyse urea. A conductimetric approach was also used for the evaluation of the overall metabolic behaviour in milk of Strep. thermophilus strains and the differences observed allowed grouping of the strains in seven different clusters. A total of 11 strains were able to produce acid in presence of galactose. Genetic diversity of Streptococcus thermophilus strains, evaluated by Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA fingerprinting (RAPD) and amplified epsC-D restriction analysis, allowed the identification of 21 different genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Comparison between the genotypic and phenotypic data highlights an interesting correlation between some important technological properties and well-defined genotypes. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The genetic and technological characterization carried out on several Strep. thermophilus strains of dairy origin should expand the knowledge on this important lactic acid bacteria species and lead to a simple, rapid, and reliable identification of strains on the basis of well-defined biotechnological properties.
TI  - Microbial community dynamics during the Scamorza Altamurana cheese natural fermentation.
AB  - The growth dynamics of the natural microbial community responsible for the fermentation of Scamorza Altamurana, a typical Southern Italian cheese made using backslopping, was investigated applying a polyphasic approach combining 1) microbial enumeration with culture media, 2) randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) fingerprinting of microbial communities, 3) sequencing of partial 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genes, and 4) physiological tests. Viable cell counts on different culture media showed that the cocci community prevailed during the 18 h of curd fermentation and the 6 d of cheese ripening. RAPD fingerprinting made it possible to isolate 25 different strains identified by 16S rDNA sequencing as belonging to five species of Lactobacillus, three species of Streptococcus, one species of Weissella, and one species of Enterococcus. The physiological analyses of all lactic acid bacteria strains revealed that the isolates belonging to Streptococcus genus were the most acidifying, whereas lactobacilli were most proteolytic. Streptococcus thermophilus C48W and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus B15Z dominated all through the fermentation process. Furthermore, they seemed to be stable in a subsequent whey sample analyzed after 7 mo. The recovery of strains endowed with interesting technological features, such as acidifying and proteolytic activities, and surviving in natural whey could allow the upscaling of cheese processing safeguarding the organoleptic characteristics of Scamorza Altamurana and could possibly improve other fermented dairy products.
TI  - Selection of dairy bacterial strains as probiotics for oral health.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to select bacterial strains with potential properties as oral probiotics, namely for the prevention of dental caries. We examined 23 dairy microorganisms, out of which we identified two Streptococcus thermophilus and two Lactcoccus lactis strains that were able to adhere to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads to the same extent as Streptococcus sobrinus OMZ176. Two of them, Strep. thermophilus NCC1561 and Lactoc. lactis ssp. lactis NCC2211, were further successfully incorporated into a biofilm mimicking the dental plaque. Furthermore, they could grow in such a biofilm together with five strains of oral bacterial species, representative of supragingival plaque. In this system, Lactoc. lactis NCC2211 was able to modulate the growth of the oral bacteria, and in particular to diminish the colonization of Streptococcus oralis OMZ607, Veillonella dispar OMZ493, Actinomyces naeslundii OMZ745 and of the cariogenic Strep. sobrinus OMZ176. These findings encourage further research with selected non-pathogenic dairy bacterial strains with the aim to decrease the cariogenic potential of dental plaque.
TI  - Transposition of pGh9:ISS1 is random and efficient in Streptococcus thermophilus  CNRZ368.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus bacteria are used as a starter in the fermentation of  yogurts and many cheeses. To construct mutants of S. thermophilus CNRZ368, the use of the plasmid pGh9:ISS1 was considered. This plasmid is known to be a good tool for insertional mutagenesis in gram-positive bacteria, owing to its ability to integrate in the genome by a mechanism of replicative transposition. However, the presence of three endogenous ISS1 copies in the genome of S. thermophilus CNRZ368 and the possible occurrence of homologous recombination could reduce the efficiency of pGh9:ISS1 as a tool for generating mutants. To address this question, the ability of pGh9:ISS1 to transpose randomly in the genome of strain CNRZ368 was investigated. The results of our experiments indicated that: (i) the frequency of transposition of ISS1 was high, approximately 2 x 10(-2), in S. thermophilus CNRZ368; (ii) the integration of multiple tandem copies of the plasmid was frequent; (iii) homologous recombination events between ISS1 were not predominant; and (iv) plasmid pGh9:ISS1 transposed randomly around the S. thermophilus CNRZ368 chromosome. In addition, we describe the strategy used to localize the pGh9:ISS1 insertion locus on the physical map of strain CNRZ368 and the method used to clone the regions flanking this insertion site, especially when multiple copies of the plasmid were integrated in tandem.
TI  - Study of the intra- and interlaboratory reproducibility of partial single base C-sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and its applicability for the identification of members of the genus Streptococcus.
AB  - The use of Single Base C-Sequencing of the first 500 bases of the 16S rRNA-gene (SBCS) combined with capillary electrophoresis was evaluated for the identification of reference strains of 30 different species within the genus Streptococcus. For SBCS, only dd-CTP's are used in the sequencing reactions instead of the four dideoxy bases and the primer is fluorescently labeled. The reproducibility, interlaboratory exchangeability and discriminative power of this method were studied by comparing the patterns obtained in three laboratories under highly standardized conditions. The interlaboratory reproducibility proved to be high, enabling the construction of a common database for the identification of strains belonging to the streptococcal species studied. Most of the examined species generated distinguishable profiles. SBCS did not differentiate between the closely related species S. constellatus and S. intermedius. Also S. thermophilus and S. vestibularis as well as S. mitis and S. pneumoniae showed highly resembling profiles. The previously reported heterogeneity within the species S. equinus was reflected by SBCS. For all other species, strains belonging to the same species generated indistinguishable patterns. In conclusion, Single Base C-sequencing of the first 500 bases of the 16S rRNA-gene could be a useful and widely applicable method for the identification of bacteria at the species level, with the added advantage of being more rapid and easier to automatize than full sequence determination.
TI  - Influence of a Spirulina platensis biomass on the microflora of fermented ABT milks during storage (R1).
AB  - The objective of this research was to investigate the effect of a cyanobacterial  (Spirulina platensis) biomass on the microflora of a probiotic fermented dairy product during storage at two temperatures. Spirulina-enriched and control (plain) fermented acidophilus-bifidus-thermophilus (ABT) milks were produced using a fast fermentation starter culture (ABT-4) as the source of Lactobacillus acidophilus (A), bifidobacteria (B), and Streptococcus thermophilus (T). Incubation took 6 h at 40 degrees C. As for the cyanobacterial product, the S. platensis biomass was added to the process milk during stirring at pH 4.5 to 4.6. Thereafter, the ABT-type fermented milks were cooled to 25 degrees C in ice water, filled into sterile, tightly capped centrifuge tubes, further cooled at 4 degrees C for 24 h, and then stored either at 15 degrees C for 18 d or at 4 degrees C for 42 d. Microbiological analyses and acidity measurements were performed at regular intervals. Our results showed that the counts of the starter organisms were satisfactory during the entire storage period at both temperatures applied in this research. The S. platensis biomass had a beneficial effect on the survival of ABT starter bacteria regardless of storage temperature. Postacidification was observed at 15 degrees C, whereas pH remained stable during refrigerated storage at 4 degrees C. The abundance of bioactive substances in S. platensis is of great importance from a nutritional point of view because thus the cyanobacterial biomass provides a new opportunity for the manufacture of functional dairy foods.
TI  - The resistance to heat of thermo-resistant streptococci attached to stainless steel in the presence of milk.
AB  - Skim milk residues had a significant impact on the sensitivity to heat of a dairy isolate of the thermo-resistant, Streptococcus thermophilus. Cells of S. thermophilus (H) suspended in water or in milk had D values at 60 degrees C of 2.0 and 14 min, respectively. Cells of S. thermophilus (H) attached to stainless steel in the presence of water or milk had D values at 60 degrees C of 2.2 and 8.1 min, respectively. The attached cells in both experiments were heat-treated in the presence of water. The increase in heat resistance could not be fully attributed to individual components (caseinate or whey) in the milk. The potential for thermo-resistant streptococci to survive heat treatment in a dairy manufacturing plant is therefore greater than may be expected for the organism in less complex environments.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the gene encoding X-prolyl-dipeptidyl aminopeptidase (PepX) from Streptococcus thermophilus strain ACA-DC 4.
AB  - AIMS: To clone and sequence the pepX gene from Streptococcus thermophilus. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three pairs of primers were used in polymerase chain reactions using as template the total DNA from Strep. thermophilus ACA-DC 4 in order to amplify, clone and sequence the pepX gene. Sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of 2268 nucleotides encoding a protein of 755 amino acids. The calculated molecular mass of 85 632 Da agreed well with the apparent molecular mass of 80 000 Da previously determined by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel filtration for the monomeric form of the purified enzyme. CONCLUSIONS: The pepX gene from Strep. thermophilus ACA-DC 4 was cloned and sequenced. The PepX protein showed significant sequence similarity with PepX enzymes from other lactic acid bacteria and contained a motif which was almost identical with the active site motif of the serine-dependent PepX family. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: There are economic and technological incentives for accelerating and controlling the process of cheese ripening. To achieve this, starters may be modified by introducing appropriate genes from other food-grade bacteria. New or additional peptidase activities may alter or improve the proteolytic properties of lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Determination of (1)H homonuclear scalar couplings in unlabeled carbohydrates.
AB  - The scarcity of structural information on carbohydrates results from combined difficulties to crystallize and the limitations in NMR analysis. Current methods for determining basic NMR parameters such as (1)H homonuclear scalar couplings are very limited, especially for large molecules such as polysaccharides, oligonucleotides, and the carbohydrate part of glycoproteins. In this paper, a NMR experiment for the determination of endocyclic (1)H homonuclear scalar couplings ((3)J(HH)) in unlabeled carbohydrates is presented. In addition to scalar couplings, cross-correlated dipole-dipole relaxation rates were measured for large polysaccharides. The measurement of all endocyclic homonuclear coupling constants within monosaccharide units is presented for lactose, a model disaccharide, and for a natural-abundance 2 MDa bacterial polysaccharide excreted by Streptococcus thermophilus Sfi39.
TI  - Comparison between Streptococcus macedonicus and Streptococcus waius strains and  reclassification of Streptococcus waius (Flint et at. 1999) as Streptococcus macedonicus (Tsakalidou et al. 1998).
AB  - Two species of dairy streptococci, Streptococcus waius and Streptococcus macedonicus, were originally characterized by 16S-23S intergenic spacer sequence analysis, random amplified polymorphic DNA fingerprinting, PFGE analysis and DNA-DNA reassociation experiments. All genetic data suggested that S. waius strains belong to the previously described species S. macedonicus. Likewise, the phenotypic characterization showed that strains of S. macedonicus and S. waius were highly related and easily differentiated from the closest phylogenetic neighbour, Streptococcus bovis, principally by their failure to produce a blackening reaction in medium containing aesculin. The utilization of maltose and cellobiose by S. macedonicus/S. waius strains allowed their differentiation from the most studied dairy species, Streptococcus thermophilus. On the basis of genetic and phenotypic data S. macedonicus and S. waius species should be considered synonyms and S. macedonicus has the priority.
TI  - Evolution of carbohydrate fraction in carbonated fermented milks as affected by beta-galactosidase activity of starter strains.
AB  - The influence of carbonation on the evolution of lactose, galactose and glucose in fermented milks with added probiotic bacteria (Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus and/or Bifidobacterium bifidum) was evaluated and related to beta-galactosidase activity of starter strains. During incubation and first days of refrigeration, lactose hydrolysis resulting in the liberation of galactose and glucose occurred in CT (Streptococcus thermophilus/Lb. casei), AT (Str. thermophilus/Lb. acidophilus) and ABT fermented milks (Str. thermophilus/Lb. acidophilus/Bifid. bifidum). Levels of galactose were higher than those of glucose and could be related to the preferential consumption of glucose by actively growing bacteria. Through the incubation, lactose and monosaccharide levels were not affected by milk carbonation. However, during refrigerated storage the presence of this gas was associated with slightly lower content of lactose and higher levels of galactose and glucose in AT and ABT products but not in CT fermented milks. Through the refrigeration galactose was moderately utilised by Lb. acidophilus in AT products whereas the presence of Bifid. bifidum seems to prevent the consumption of this sugar in ABT fermented milks. Glucose remained constant, with minor variations in CT products but a continuous increase of this sugar occurred in carbonated AT and ABT fermented milks during storage. Beta-galactosidase activity displayed by Str. thermophilus strains was similar at pH 6.5 (initial pH of non-carbonated samples) and pH 6.3 (initial pH of carbonated samples) whereas Lb. acidophilus LaA3 showed greater beta-galactosidase activity at pH 6.3 than at higher pH values. Thus, the enhanced metabolic activity of Lb. acidophilus caused by the low initial pH of carbonated milk also promoted higher cellular beta-galactosidase activity that could have released greater amounts of galactose and glucose from lactose in AT and ABT fermented milks through the refrigerated period. In CT fermented milks, similar beta-galactosidase activity levels of Str. thermophilus at pH 6.5 and 6.3 together with the absence of beta-galactosidase activity in Lb. casei could explain the lack of differences on glucose and galactose content between carbonated and non-carbonated samples.
TI  - Casein utilization by Streptococcus thermophilus results in a diauxic growth in milk.
AB  - In milk, Streptococcus thermophilus displays two distinct exponential growth phases, separated by a nonexponential one, during which proteinase synthesis was initiated. During the second exponential phase, utilization of caseins as the source of amino acids resulted in a decrease in growth rate, presumably caused by a limiting peptide transport activity.
TI  - Transcription mapping as a tool in phage genomics: the case of the temperate Streptococcus thermophilus phage Sfi21.
AB  - For the lytic growth cycle of the temperate cos-site Streptococcus thermophilus phage Sfi21 a transcription map was developed on the basis of systematic Northern blot hybridizations. All deduced 5' ends were confirmed by primer extension analysis. Three time classes of transcripts were observed. Early transcripts were identified in four different genome regions. One prominent early mRNA of 4.8 kb length covered a group of 12 genes located between the origin of replication and the cos-site. Two short early mRNAs represented a single gene from the direct vicinity of the cos-site and the superinfection immunity gene from the lysogeny module, respectively. A fourth early transcript covered a group of four genes located between the lysin and the integrase gene. Middle transcripts of 2.1 and 5.8 kb length covered cro-like and ant-like repressor genes and the DNA replication module, respectively. Four types of late transcripts were identified. The transcripts covered the likely DNA packaging genes, the head morphogenesis module plus the major tail gene, the remainder of the tail genes, and the putative tail fiber plus lysis genes, respectively. Only the transcript from the head morphogenesis genes yielded defined late mRNA species. The transcription map concurred with most of the in silico predictions for the genome organization of phage Sfi21 except for the separation of the DNA replication module from a possible transcription regulation module. Most 5' ends of the transcripts determined in primer-extension experiments were not preceded by a consensus promoter sequence. The involvement of phage-encoded regulators for middle and late transcription was suggested by chloramphenicol-inhibition experiments.
TI  - Behavior of Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus in yogurt fermented  with a bacteriocin-producing thermophilic starter.
AB  - Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus B producing a bacteriocin active against Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 7644 and Staphylococcus aureus SAD 30 was isolated from bakery yeast. The bacteriocin was partially purified by an adsorption/desorption technique, and its spectrum of action was compared to that of a neutralized cell-free supernatant (CFS). Although the CFS inhibited a number of gram-positive and -negative bacteria of health and spoilage significance, the spectrum of action of the partially purified bacteriocin was limited to gram-positive bacteria. L. monocytogenes was the most sensitive to both preparations. The bacteriocin-producing streptococcal strain was used in combination with a Bac- Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CY strain isolated from commercial yogurt to assess the effectiveness of the resulting thermophilic starter in controlling L. monocytogenes and S. aureus in yogurt during fermentation and storage at refrigeration (ca. 7 degrees C) or abuse (ca. 22 degrees C) temperature. Yogurt samples were contaminated with L. monocytogenes or S. aureus to the approximate levels of 10(3) and 10(6) CFU/ml of milk, respectively. The results showed that in situ bacteriocin production was more active against L. monocytogenes than against S. aureus in vitro and in contaminated samples. While L. monocytogenes leveled off below the detectable limit in a 1-ml sample of yogurt within 24 h of processing, S. aureus survived in Bac+ and Bac- samples during 10 days of storage at room temperature (ca. 22 degrees C). Use of a Bac+ starter resulted in a 5-day extension of the shelf life.
TI  - Interactions among lactic acid starter and probiotic bacteria used for fermented  dairy products.
AB  - Interactions among lactic acid starter and probiotic bacteria were investigated to establish adequate combinations of strains to manufacture probiotic dairy products. For this aim, a total of 48 strains of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, and Bifidobacterium spp. (eight of each) were used. The detection of bacterial interactions was carried out using the well-diffusion agar assay, and the interactions found were further characterized by growth kinetics. A variety of interactions was demonstrated. Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus was found to be able to inhibit S. thermophilus strains. Among probiotic cultures, Lb. acidophilus was the sole species that was inhibited by the others (Lb. casei and Bifidobacterium). In general, probiotic bacteria proved to be more inhibitory towards lactic acid bacteria than vice versa since the latter did not exert any effect on the growth of the former, with some exceptions. The study of interactions by growth kinetics allowed the setting of four different kinds of behaviors between species of lactic acid starter and probiotic bacteria (stimulation, delay, complete inhibition of growth, and no effects among them). The possible interactions among the strains selected to manufacture a probiotic fermented dairy product should be taken into account when choosing the best combination/s to optimize their performance in the process and their survival in the products during cold storage.
TI  - Capsule formation by nonropy starter cultures affects the viscoelastic properties of yogurt during structure formation.
AB  - The aim of this work was to study the structure formation of yogurt made with cultures containing ropy Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (R), capsule-forming nonropy Streptococcus thermophilus (CNR), and noncapsule-forming nonropy cultures (NCNR). Similar gelation profiles were shown for milk fermented by ropy and nonropy lactic cultures. The gelation point occurred at lower pH values in milk fermented with R or NCNR compared to that of milk fermented with CNR culture. Differences between capsule forming ropy and nonropy cultures were observed in the aggregation behavior of the caseins. Gels made with R culture had the highest maximum in loss tangent (tan delta). However, this maximum occurred at the highest pH value when CNR culture was used. The earlier gelation of milk fermented by the encapsulated nonropy strain of Strep. thermophilus resulted in increased structure rearrangement as the pH dropped, interfering with the formation of a more compact structure.
TI  - Activity of the enzymes involved in the synthesis of exopolysaccharide precursors in an overproducing mutant ropy strain of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The activities of some enzymes belonging to the Leloir pathway, phosphoglucomutase, UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, UDP-galactose 4-epimerase and galactose 1-P uridyl transferase, were studied in a wild ropy, a non-ropy and an overproducing mutant ropy strain of Streptococcus thermophilus. These activities were assayed over successive culture transfers along with exocellular polysaccharide (EPS) production. The overproducing mutant ropy strain showed increments in polysaccharide production over successive culture transfers, as opposed to reductions in production by the wild ropy strain. The observed variations among strains in the enzyme activities that were analysed in relation to EPS production suggest their involvement in the synthesis of sugar-nucleotide EPS precursors.
TI  - Effects of rodA and pbp2b disruption on cell morphology and oxidative stress response of Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ368.
AB  - Insertional mutagenesis was used to isolate clones from Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ368 that were modified in their abilities to tolerate oxidative stress. During this process, two menadione-sensitive clones (6G4 and 18C3) were found to display abnormal cell morphologies and distorted chain topologies and were further studied. Molecular characterization of both 6G4 and 18C3 mutants indicated that they were disrupted in open reading frames homologous to rodA and pbp2b, respectively. Both genes encoded proteins in Escherichia coli that were described as being implicated in peptidoglycan synthesis during the process of cell elongation and to function in determining the rod shape of the cell. This work reports a possible connection between peptidoglycan biosynthesis and oxidative stress defense in S. thermophilus CNRZ368.
TI  - Autolytic phenotype of Lactococcus lactis strains isolated from traditional Tunisian dairy products.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the autolytic properties of Lactococcus lactis strains isolated from artisan Tunisian dairy products, their peptidoglycan hydrolase content and their activity spectrum. METHODS AND RESULTS: The autolytic phenotype of Lactococcus strains was evaluated under starvation conditions in potassium phosphate buffer. The results obtained highlighted a high degree of diversity among the strains analysed, allowing the identification of high and low autolytic Lactococcus lactis strains. Peptidoglycan hydrolase content was evaluated by renaturing SDS-PAGE using cells of Micrococcus lysodeikticus as a target for the enzymatic activity. A major activity band migrating at about 45 kDa was observed. The lytic activity, evaluated in the presence of different chemicals, was retained in 8% NaCl, 15 mmol l(-1) CaCl2, and in a pH range between 5 and 9.5. The substrate specificity of peptidoglycan hydrolase from Lactococcus strains was evaluated in renaturing SDS-PAGE incorporating cells of different bacterial species. The major autolysin of Lactococcus lactis was active against cells of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus helveticus and Listeria monocytogenes. CONCLUSIONS: Autolytic activity is widely distributed in Lactococcus lactis and the rate of autolysis is strain-dependent. The major peptidoglycan hydrolase showed a wide spectrum of activity against several lactic acid bacteria and bacterial species involved in food-related infection. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The autolytic phenotype of Lactococcus lactis strains isolated from Tunisian artisan dairy products has been determined, and the data obtained should allow the selection of strains of technological interest in the cheese-ripening process.
TI  - Apoptotic effects of selected strains of lactic acid bacteria on a human T leukemia cell line are associated with bacterial arginine deiminase and/or sphingomyelinase activities.
AB  - The aim of the present work was, first, to analyze the apoptotic effect in vitro  of sonicated preparations of selected strains of lactic acid bacteria on normal and tumor human lymphocytes. Incubation with bacterial samples led to a relevant time-dependent apoptotic cell death of Jurkat cells but not normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Lactobacillus brevis (CD2) samples were more efficient in inducing apoptosis of Jurkat cells than were samples of Streptococcus thermophilus (S244). In an attempt to characterize the mechanisms underlying these effects, we found that the apoptotic death-inducing ability of S244 preparations could be attributed to the ability of high levels of neutral sphingomyelinase activity to generate relevant amounts of ceramide, a known apoptotic death messenger, in Jurkat cells. On the other hand, our results indicate that apoptosis induced by CD2 samples could also be associated with high levels of arginine deiminase activity, which in turn was able to downregulate polyamine synthesis in Jurkat cells.
TI  - Lack of therapeutic effect of a specially designed yogurt for the eradication of  Helicobacter pylori infection.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current antibiotic treatment for Helicobacter pylori infection is often associated with frequent adverse effects and resistance to antibiotics. Alternative treatment methods to control H. pylori infection are needed. Some specific strains of lactic acid bacteria (probiotics) in dairy products are known to inhibit the growth of H. pylori in vitro. A clinical trial was conducted to see the efficacy of a specially designed yogurt product containing specific probiotics on the eradication of H. pylori. METHOD: The yogurt was prepared using three Lactobacillus spp. (L. acidophilus and L. casei) and one commercial starter culture (L. acidophilus, L. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus). All these cultures were previously evaluated, and found to have strong in vitro inhibitory effects on the growth of H. pylori. Twenty-seven asymptomatic women positive for H. pylori on gastric biopsy and 13C urea breath test were recruited, and administered 175 ml of the yogurt three times a day for 30 days. The 13C urea breath test was administered again, one month after stopping the yogurt treatment to detect the presence of H. pylori. RESULTS: In 26 of 27 subjects, the urea breath test values remained positive, indicating that the consumption of the yogurt had no effect on the eradication of H. pylori. CONCLUSION: Although the designed fermented milk containing lactobacilli is very effective in the inhibition of H. pylori growth in vitro, eradication of this infection in humans is difficult to achieve by consuming this product.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in kefir grains and kefir made from them.
AB  - In an investigation of the changes in the microflora along the pathway: kefir grains (A)-->kefir made from kefir grains (B)-->kefir made from kefir as inoculum (C), the following species of lactic acid bacteria (83-90%) of the microbial count in the grains) were identified: Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus casei subsp. pseudoplantarum and Lactobacillus brevis. Yeasts (10-17%) identified were Kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida inconspicua and Candida maris. In the microbial population of kefir grains and kefir made from them the homofermentative lactic streptococci (52-65% and 79-86%, respectively) predominated. Within the group of lactobacilli, the homofermentative thermophilic species L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and L. helveticus (70-87% of the isolated bacilli) predominated. Along the pathway A-->B-->C, the streptococcal proportion in the total kefir microflora increased by 26-30% whereas the lactobacilli decreased by 13-23%. K. marxianus var. lactis was permanently present in kefir grains and kefirs, whereas the dominant lactose-negative yeast in the total yeast flora of the kefir grains dramatically decreased in kefir C.
TI  - Simulation modelling of bacterial growth in yoghurt.
AB  - INDISIM, an individual-based simulator, was used to specifically study the influence of the shape and size of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus in yoghurt processing. To this effect, two different sets of simulations were carried out. In the first set of simulations, it was assumed that the initial acidity of the medium has the same value as the acidity of the cytoplasm of the microorganisms. Hence, the differences in bacterial growth by the two species are only attributable to differences in their geometry. It was found that, in an optimum culture, the growth in biomass of S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus is larger than that of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. An important factor for understanding this difference might be the larger mass-to-surface ratio of the former. In the second set of simulations, a simplified model of yoghurt, the parametrisation differs both in the geometry and the metabolism of the two species. The results of these simulations are in very good qualitative agreement with the experimental data of [Lait 69 (1989) 519]. Finally, by inhibiting the uptake of amino acids by S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus, the large relative importance of lactic acid in yoghurt processing was highlighted.
TI  - A novel area of predictive modelling: describing the functionality of beneficial  microorganisms in foods.
AB  - Predictive microbiology generally focuses on the potential outgrowth of spoilage  bacteria and foodborne pathogens in foods. Little attention has been paid to the biokinetics of beneficial foodgrade microorganisms, such as lactic acid bacteria. The latter is commonly used in the food fermentation industry, mainly for the in situ production of the antimicrobial lactic acid to extend the shelf life of the food. Furthermore, many strains show additional industrial potential as novel starter cultures since they produce functional metabolites, such as bacteriocins and exopolysaccharides. The production of these functional metabolites has been demonstrated during in vitro experiments, but in many cases these novel starter cultures seem to be less efficient when applied in a food system. A modelling approach may contribute to a better understanding of the tight relation between the food environment and bacterial functionality. Primary modelling can be applied to fit the experimental data concerning cell growth, sugar metabolism, and the production of functional metabolites for a given set of environmental conditions. This led to conclusions concerning the growth-associated production of bacteriocin and exopolysaccharides, the inactivation of these molecules when cell growth levels off, and a minimum cell concentration to trigger on bacteriocin production. Examples deal with the production of the bacteriocin sakacin K by the natural fermented sausage isolate Lactobacillus sakei CTC 494, and the production of heteropolysaccharides by the yoghurt starter culture Streptococcus thermophilus LY03. Secondary modelling of biokinetic parameters quantifies the production of bacteriocin and exopolysaccharides in function of environmental factors. As an example, the specific bacteriocin production by Lb. sakei CTC 494 decreases with increasing sodium chloride concentrations. Furthermore, since the assessment of functionality is frequently hampered by the nature of the food system, mathematical modelling techniques may help to predict the functional behaviour of novel lactic acid bacteria starter cultures in a food matrix, and hence quantify in situ production. For example, a model may simulate cell growth and exopolysaccharide production of S. thermophilus LY03 in a milk environment, where direct measurements are difficult to perform.
TI  - Prediction of the adherence, growth and release of microorganisms in production chains.
AB  - The aim of this study was to develop a mathematical model that describes the bacterial contamination of food as a result of adherence, growth and release of bacteria in process equipment. The model developed can be applied to control the bacterial quality of food products produced in process chains in which the final contamination of the product is governed by growth and heat-induced destruction of bacteria. To set up the model, experiments were carried out with a plate heat exchanger using milk inoculated with Streptococcus thermophilus. The growth rate of S. thermophilus in milk could be described accurately by the modified expanded model of Ratkowsky. The observed increase in the concentration of S. thermophilus in milk at the outlet of the plate heat exchanger could be described quantitatively by the model. To predict the contamination of the product, the model was integrated into NIZO-PCS (Process Chain Simulator). The results of computer simulations were validated by a number of measurements in a cheese factory. It turned out that the agreement between the measured and calculated concentrations of S. thermophilus was sufficient for the model to be used for predictions in industrial production chains.
TI  - Diversity, dynamics, and activity of bacterial communities during production of an artisanal Sicilian cheese as evaluated by 16S rRNA analysis.
AB  - The diversity and dynamics of the microbial communities during the manufacturing  of Ragusano cheese, an artisanal cheese produced in Sicily (Italy), were investigated by a combination of classical and culture-independent approaches. The latter included PCR, reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR), and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rRNA genes (rDNA). Bacterial and Lactobacillus group-specific primers were used to amplify the V6 to V8 and V1 to V3 regions of the 16S rRNA gene, respectively. DGGE profiles from samples taken during cheese production indicated dramatic shifts in the microbial community structure. Cloning and sequencing of rDNA amplicons revealed that mesophilic lactic acid bacteria (LAB), including species of Leuconostoc, Lactococcus lactis, and Macrococcus caseolyticus were dominant in the raw milk, while Streptococcus thermophilus prevailed during lactic fermentation. Other thermophilic LAB, especially Lactobacillus delbrueckii and Lactobacillus fermentum, also flourished during ripening. Comparison of the rRNA-derived patterns obtained by RT-PCR to the rDNA DGGE patterns indicated a substantially different degree of metabolic activity for the microbial groups detected. Identification of cultivated LAB isolates by phenotypic characterization and 16S rDNA analysis indicated a variety of species, reflecting to a large extent the results obtained from the 16S rDNA clone libraries, with the significant exception of the Lactobacillus delbrueckii species, which dominated in the ripening cheese but was not detected by cultivation. The present molecular approaches combined with culture can effectively describe the complex ecosystem of natural fermented dairy products, giving useful information for starter culture design and preservation of artisanal fermented food technology.
TI  - Enteroinvasive bacteria alter barrier and transport properties of human intestinal epithelium: role of iNOS and COX-2.
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Various invasive pathogens cause diarrhea, but the mechanism(s) are poorly understood. We hypothesized that nitric oxide and prostaglandins might modulate chloride secretory and barrier properties of the infected intestinal epithelium and that diarrhea is caused, in part, by altered expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2). METHODS: Studies were conducted in human intestinal epithelial cell lines (HT29/cl.19A, Caco-2, and T84). Cells were infected with enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC 029:NM) or Salmonella dublin (SD), or nonpathogenic, noninvasive bacteria (Streptococcus thermophilus [ST] and Lactobacillus acidophilus [LA]). Infected cells and controls were tested for transepithelial resistance, chloride secretion, prostaglandin E2, guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate and adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, and protein expression. RESULTS: Cells infected with EIEC or SD, but not uninfected controls or ST/LA-exposed monolayers, showed a progressive reduction in transepithelial resistance starting at 6-12 hours. Infected HT29/cl.19A and Caco-2 cells, but not T84 cells, also showed an increase in total nitrite. Expression of iNOS, and consequently COX-2, was also increased, followed by increased production of prostaglandins and cyclic nucleotides. Furthermore, basal and stimulated chloride secretory responses to various agonists were enhanced in HT29/cl.19A and Caco-2 cells after infection with enteroinvasive bacteria, and this effect was reversed for some agonists by iNOS or COX-2 inhibitors. Increased expression of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and NKCC1 was also observed in EIEC or SD-infected cells vs. controls, secondary to NO synthase activity. CONCLUSIONS: Up-regulation of iNOS and COX-2 by enteroinvasive bacteria can modulate chloride secretion and barrier function in intestinal epithelial cells. Thus, these enzymes represent possible therapeutic targets in infectious diarrhea.
TI  - Effects of dairy products on heterocyclic aromatic amine-induced rat colon carcinogenesis.
AB  - Heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAA) are initiating agents of colon carcinogenesis  in animals and are suspected in the aetiology of human colon cancer. In the context of prevention, it seems interesting to test possible protective compounds, such as fermented milk, against HAA food carcinogens. Male F344 rats were used in a model of HAA-induced colon carcinogenesis. The HAA, 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ) and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) (ratio 1:1:1) were administered in food for a 7 week induction period, with a cumulative dose of 250 mg of the HAA, per kg body weight. Four different diets were given to four rat groups: supplemented with 20% water, 30% non-fermented milk, 30% Bifidobacterium animalis DN-173 010 fermented milk and 30% Streptococcus thermophilus DN-001 158 fermented milk. Fecal mutagenicity was quantified during the induction period. At the end of the treatment, DNA lesion levels were determined in the liver and colon using the number of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'desoxyguanosine (8-oxodGuo) oxidized bases, "3D Test" and comet assay. The metabolic activity of hepatic and colon cytochrome P450 (CYP450) 1A1 and 1A2 was also evaluated. Aberrant colon crypts were scored, 8 weeks after the last HAA treatment. The results showed that dairy products decreased the incidence of aberrant crypts in rats: 66% inhibition with the milk-supplemented diet, 96% inhibition with the B.animalis fermented milk-supplemented diet and 93% inhibition with the S.thermophilus fermented milk-supplemented diet. Intermediate biomarkers showed that there was a decrease in HAA metabolism, fecal mutagenicity and colon DNA lesions. These results demonstrate the early protective effect of milk in the carcinogenesis process. This effect being more pronounced in the case of milk fermented by lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Operating conditions that affect the resistance of lactic acid bacteria to freezing and frozen storage.
AB  - Thermophilic lactic acid bacteria exhibit different survival rates during freezing and frozen storage, depending on the processing conditions. We used a Plackett and Burman experimental design to study the effects of 13 experimental factors, at two levels, on the resistance of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus to freezing and frozen storage. The resistance was evaluated by quantifying the decrease of acidification activity during freezing and throughout 8 weeks of storage. Acidification activity after freezing and frozen storage was affected by 12 experimental factors. Only the thawing temperature did not show any significant effect. S. thermophilus was more resistant than L. bulgaricus and the cryoprotective effect of glycerol during freezing and storage was confirmed. The temperature and duration of the cryoprotection step influenced acidification activity following the freezing step: the lower the temperature and the shorter the duration, the higher the activity. Acidification activity after storage was affected by several experimental factors involved in the fermentation stage: use of NaOH instead of NH4OH for pH control, addition of Tween 80 in the culture medium, and faster cooling led to better cryotolerance. Resistance to freezing and frozen storage was improved by using a high freezing rate and a low storage temperature. Finally, this study revealed that the conditions under which lactic acid bacteria are prepared should be well controlled to improve their preservation and to limit the variability between batches and between species.
TI  - The potential of a polyphasic PCR-dGGE approach in evaluating microbial diversity of natural whey cultures for water-buffalo Mozzarella cheese production: bias of culture-dependent and culture-independent analyses.
AB  - A polyphasic PCR-DGGE approach was used to describe the microbial population occurring in natural whey cultures (NWCs) for water-buffalo Mozzarella cheese production. Total microbial community was assessed without cultivation by analyzing DNA directly extracted from the original samples of NWC. In addition, DNA extracted from bulks of cells formed by harvesting colonies from the serial dilution agar plates of a variety of culture media was used to profile the "cultivable" community. The 16S rDNA V3 region was amplified using DNA from NWC as well as DNA from bulks as templates and the amplicons were separated by DGGE. The microbial entities occurring in NWCs were identified by partial 16S rDNA sequencing of DGGE bands: four lactic acid bacteria (LAB) closest relative of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii and Lactobacillus crispatus were revealed by the analysis of DNA directly extracted from NWC while two other LAB, Lactobacillus fermentum and Enterococcus faecalis, were identified by analyzing DNA from the cultivable community. The developed PCR-DGGE analysis of the "cultivable" community showed good potential in evaluating microbial diversity of a dairy environment: it usefully highlighted the bias introduced by selective amplification when compared to the analysis of the total community from NWC and allowed suitability of media and growth conditions to be evaluated. Moreover, it could be used to complete the culture independent study of microbial diversity to give information on concentration ratios among species occurring in a particular environment and can be proposed for rapid identification of dominant microorganisms in alternative to traditional tools.
TI  - Effect of clindamycin given alone or with Lactobacillus delbrueckii and Streptococcus thermophilus on 7alpha-dehydroxylation of bile acids in rats.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the influence of clindamycin, given alone or with Lactobacillus delbrueckii and Streptococcus thermophilus to conventional rats, on 7alpha-dehydroxylation of cholic acid to deoxycholic acid. METHODS: The presence of deoxycholic acid was determined by gas-liquid chromatography. The fecal concentration of clindamycin was determined on PDM antibiotic sensitivity medium. Colony-forming units of L. delbrueckii and S. thermophilus were counted on lactic acid bacteria agar, and their ability to deconjugate was determined by thin-layer chromatography. RESULTS: Clindamycin significantly reduced the formation of deoxycholic acid, while the administration of lactobacilli-streptococci at the same time significantly reduced the effect of the antibiotic (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Clindamycin reduced the formation of deoxycholic acid in rats and this effect was diminished by concomitant administration of L. delbrueckii and S. thermophilus. As the given microbes could not 7alpha-dehydroxylate, it seems reasonable to assume that they stimulate microbial species already present in the intestine.
TI  - Development of a minimal chemically-defined medium for the exponential growth of  Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - AIMS: The present work aimed to define a minimal chemically-defined medium which  could sustain the growth of most (if not all) strains of Streptococcus thermophilus. METHODS AND RESULTS: A minimal medium containing 20 components, including one carbohydrate source, six amino acids, two metallic ions, six vitamins and urea allowed for growth of 13 out of 15 Strep. thermophilus strains. Growth of the two last strains required the presence of additional amino acids, the number of which depended on the strain. Growth rates of the strains in the minimal medium ranged from 0.38 to 0.64 h(-1), and final populations were about 10(8) cfu ml(-1). CONCLUSIONS: Streptococcus thermophilus appears much less demanding than other lactic acid bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The definition of such a growth medium will be very useful for metabolic flux studies as well as peptide transport studies.
TI  - Exopolysaccharide production by Streptococcus thermophilus SY: production and preliminary characterization of the polymer.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the effect of yeast extract (YE) concentration, temperature and pH on growth and exopolysaccharide (EPS) production in a whey-based medium by Streptococcus thermophilus SY and to characterize the partially purified EPS. METHODS AND RESULTS: Factorial experiments and empirical model building were used to optimize fermentation conditions and the chemical composition, average molecular weight (MW) and rheological properties of aqueous dispersions of the EPS were determined. Exopolysaccharide production was growth associated and was higher (152 mg l(-1)) at pH 6.4 and 36 degrees C with 4 g l(-1) YE. High performance size exclusion chromatography of the partially purified EPS showed two peaks, with a weight average MW of 2 x 10(6) and 5 x 10(4), respectively. The EPS was a heteropolysaccharide, with a glucose : galactose : rhamnose ratio of 2 : 4.5 : 1. Its water dispersions had a pseudoplastic behaviour and showed a higher viscosity of xanthan solutions. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The fermentation conditions and some properties of an EPS produced by Strep. thermophilus, a dairy starter organism, were described.
TI  - Streptococcus thermophilus is able to produce a beta-galactosidase active during  its transit in the digestive tract of germ-free mice.
AB  - This work presents data on the application of a bacterial luciferase used to monitor gene expression of Streptococcus thermophilus in the digestive tract. The main result is that the bacterium was able to produce an active beta-galactosidase in the digestive tract, although it did not multiply during its transit. This production was enhanced when lactose (the inducer) was added to the diet.
TI  - Enhanced exopolysaccharide production by metabolic engineering of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - It is possible that the low levels of production of exopolysaccharides (EPSs) by  lactic acid bacteria could be improved by altering the levels of enzymes in the central metabolism that influence the production of precursor nucleotide sugars. To test this hypothesis, we identified and cloned the galU gene, which codes for UDP glucose pyrophosphorylase (GalU) in Streptococcus thermophilus LY03. Homologous overexpression of the gene led to a 10-fold increase in GalU activity but did not have any effect on the EPS yield when lactose was the carbon source. However, when galU was overexpressed in combination with pgmA, which encodes phosphoglucomutase (PGM), the EPS yield increased from 0.17 to 0.31 g/mol of carbon from lactose. A galactose-fermenting LY03 mutant (Gal(+)) with increased activities of the Leloir enzymes was also found to have a higher EPS yield (0.24 g/mol of carbon) than the parent strain. The EPS yield was further improved to 0.27 g/mol of carbon by overexpressing galU in this strain. However, the highest EPS yield, 0.36 g/mol of carbon, was obtained when pgmA was knocked out in the Gal(+) strain. Measurements of the levels of intracellular metabolites in the cultures revealed that the Gal(+) strains had considerably higher glucose 1-phosphate levels than the other strains, and the strain lacking PGM activity had threefold-higher levels of glucose 1-phosphate than the other Gal(+) strains. These results show that it is possible to increase EPS production by altering the levels of enzymes in the central carbohydrate metabolism.
TI  - Expression of antisense RNA targeted against Streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophages.
AB  - Antisense RNA complementary to a putative helicase gene (hel3.1) of a cos-type Streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophage was used to impede the proliferation of a number of cos-type S. thermophilus bacteriophages and one pac-type bacteriophage. The putative helicase gene is a component of the Sfi21-type DNA replication module, which is found in a majority of the S. thermophilus bacteriophages of industrial importance. All bacteriophages that strongly hybridized a 689-bp internal hel3.1 probe were sensitive to the expression of antisense hel3.1 RNA. A 40 to 70% reduction in efficiency of plaquing (EOP) was consistently observed, with a concomitant decrease in plaque size relative to that of the S. thermophilus parental strain. When progeny were released, the burst size was reduced. Growth curves of S. thermophilus NCK1125, in the presence of variable levels of bacteriophage kappa3, showed that antisense hel3.1 conferred protection, even at a multiplicity of infection of approximately 1.0. When the hel3.1 antisense RNA cassette was expressed in cis from the kappa3-derived phage-encoded resistance (PER) plasmid pTRK690::ori3.1, the EOP for bacteriophages sensitive to PER and antisense targeting was reduced to between 10(-7) and 10(-8), beyond the resistance conferred by the PER element alone (less than 10(-6)). These results illustrate the first successful applications of antisense RNA and explosive delivery of antisense RNA to inhibit the proliferation of S. thermophilus bacteriophages.
TI  - Galactose and lactose genes from the galactose-positive bacterium Streptococcus salivarius and the phylogenetically related galactose-negative bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus: organization, sequence, transcription, and activity of the gal gene products.
AB  - Streptococcus salivarius is a lactose- and galactose-positive bacterium that is phylogenetically closely related to Streptococcus thermophilus, a bacterium that metabolizes lactose but not galactose. In this paper, we report a comparative characterization of the S. salivarius and S. thermophilus gal-lac gene clusters. The clusters have the same organization with the order galR (codes for a transcriptional regulator and is transcribed in the opposite direction), galK (galactokinase), galT (galactose-1-P uridylyltransferase), galE (UDP-glucose 4-epimerase), galM (galactose mutarotase), lacS (lactose transporter), and lacZ (beta-galactosidase). An analysis of the nucleotide sequence as well as Northern blotting and primer extension experiments revealed the presence of four promoters located upstream from galR, the gal operon, galM, and the lac operon of S. salivarius. Putative promoters with virtually identical nucleotide sequences were found at the same positions in the S. thermophilus gal-lac gene cluster. An additional putative internal promoter at the 3' end of galT was found in S. thermophilus but not in S. salivarius. The results clearly indicated that the gal-lac gene cluster was efficiently transcribed in both species. The Shine-Dalgarno sequences of galT and galE were identical in both species, whereas the ribosome binding site of S. thermophilus galK differed from that of S. salivarius by two nucleotides, suggesting that the S. thermophilus galK gene might be poorly translated. This was confirmed by measurements of enzyme activities.
TI  - Specific IgA to lactic acid bacteria in feces of children consuming milk fermented by yoghurt symbiosis and Lactobacillus casei (Danone strain DN 114 001).
AB  - An immunoreactive role of lactic acid bacteria established in animals has seldom  been investigated in humans. In a large-scale clinical study, children from day-care centers received either yoghurt (Y), milk fermented by yoghurt symbiosis and Lactobacillus casei (DN 114 001) (YC), or gelified milk (GM) as diet supplements during two 30-day supplementation periods separated by one 30-day period without supplementation. Feces samples were collected before, during, and after the 2nd supplementation period. Proteins were extracted in a buffer containing enzymatic inhibitors. IgA levels were assessed and adjusted to the weight of feces samples. Specific IgA to lactic acid bacteria strains (Streptococcus thermophilus 8901A, 8902A; Lactobacillus bulgaricus; Lactobacillus casei) present in Y and YC were assayed in ELISA and adjusted to individual IgA levels. Mean levels of fecal IgA were within reported ranges for pediatric populations of similar age. IgA levels decreased significantly but transiently in children receiving Y, and increased significantly in children receiving GM, but did not vary in the group of children who were given YC. Specific IgA to the 4 strains tested increased significantly during the supplementation period only in the group of children receiving GM, while it was transient and not significant in children receiving YC. No variation was noted in children given Y Specific IgA to lactic acid bacteria can be assayed in feces. Supplementation with fermented milks might induce a mucosal tolerance to environmental flora.
TI  - Prediction of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus populations in yoghurt by Curie point pyrolysis-mass spectrometry.
AB  - We evaluated the potential of pyrolysis-mass spectrometry (PyMS) for quantifying  the binary mixed population of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus in yoghurt. For this purpose, a new analytical approach was developed. The yoghurt was transparised and its total bacterial population was recovered by centrifugation and estimated by turbidimetric measurement. The quantity of each population (L. bulgaricus, S. thermophilus) was then estimated in the pellet by PyMS, and the data were analysed by artificial neural networks (ANNs). In parallel, streptococci and lactobacilli were numerated on SYL agar and these data were used as reference values to predict the bacterial counts of each population by PyMS. A close correlation was established between the streptococci and the lactobacilli counts on SYL agar and PyMS measurements (r(2)=0.98 for S. thermophilus and r(2)=0.96 for L. bulgaricus). Combined turbidimetric measurement and PyMS/ANNs seemed to be a powerful method for obtaining rapid counts of binary mixtures of bacteria in yoghurt.
TI  - The use of probiotics in gastrointestinal disease.
AB  - Probiotics are living microorganisms that can affect the host in a beneficial manner. Prebiotics are nondigestible food ingredients that stimulate the growth and activity of probiotic bacteria already established in the colon. Efficacy of probiotic compounds has been shown in a wide range of gastrointestinal diseases. Lactobacillus GG alone, or the combination of Bifidobacterium bifidum and Streptococcus thermophilus, is effective in the treatment of Clostridium difficile, as well as in preventing the frequency and severity of infectious acute diarrhea in children. Prevention of antibiotic-induced diarrhea with the concomitant administration of either Lactobacillus GG or Saccharomyces boulardii has been demonstrated. The most successful studies involve the use of Lactobacillus GG at a dose of 1 x 1010 viable organisms per day and the yeast boulardii at a dose of 1 g/day. A probiotic preparation (VSL#3 - 6 g/day) that uses a combination of three species of Bifidobacterium, four strains of Lactobacillus and one strain of Streptocccus has shown promise in maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis and pouchitis, as well as in preventing the postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease. The mechanism of action of probiotics may include receptor competition, effects on mucin secretion or probiotic immunomodulation of gut-associated lymphoid tissue. Oral administration of probiotic compounds has been demonstrated to be well tolerated and safe. However, while probiotics have the potential to improve human health and to prevent and treat some diseases, major improvements are needed in labelling and quality assurance procedures for probiotic compounds. In addition, well planned and controlled clinical studies are necessary to delineate fully the potential for probiotic compounds.
TI  - Evolution of the lactic acid bacterial community during malt whisky fermentation: a polyphasic study.
AB  - The development of the lactic acid bacterial community in a commercial malt whisky fermentation occurred in three broad phases. Initially, bacteria were inhibited by strong yeast growth. Fluorescence microscopy and environmental scanning electron microscopy revealed, in this early stage, both cocci and rods that were at least partly derived from the wort and yeast but also stemmed from the distillery plant. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of partial 16S rRNA genes and sequence analysis revealed cocci related to Streptococcus thermophilus or Saccharococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus brevis, and Lactobacillus fermentum. The middle phase began 35 to 40 h after yeast inoculation and was characterized by exponential growth of lactobacilli and residual yeast metabolism. Lactobacillus casei or Lactobacillus paracasei, L. fermentum, and Lactobacillus ferintoshensis were detected in samples of fermenting wort examined by DGGE during this stage. Bacterial growth was accompanied by the accumulation of acetic and lactic acids and the metabolism of residual maltooligosaccharides. By 70 h, two new PCR bands were detected on DGGE gels, and the associated bacteria were largely responsible for the final phase of the fermentation. The bacteria were phylogenetically related to Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii, and strains similar to the former had previously been recovered from malt whisky fermentations in Japan. These were probably obligately homofermentative bacteria, required malt wort for growth, and could not be cultured on normal laboratory media, such as MRS. Their metabolism during the last 20 to 30 h of fermentation was associated with yeast death and autolysis and further accumulation of lactate but no additional acetate.
TI  - Resistance to freezing and frozen storage of Streptococcus thermophilus is related to membrane fatty acid composition.
AB  - The resistance to freezing and frozen storage of Streptococcus thermophilus was related to the fatty acid composition of the cell membrane. The effects of four experimental factors were investigated on the fatty acid concentrations and on the recovery of acidification activity of S. thermophilus stored at -20 degrees C by using a complete experimental design: incorporating oleic acid in the culture medium, fermentation pH, addition of glycerol as cryoprotective agent and duration of storage. The acidification activity decreased during the freezing and the frozen storage of S. thermophilus. The storage time slightly enhanced the unsaturated fatty acid concentrations. The addition of glycerol did not modify the fatty acid composition but increased the resistance to frozen storage. The addition of oleic acid and the decrease of the fermentation pH enhanced the ratio unsaturated:saturated fatty acids and improved the recovery of the acidification activity. These results indicate that the resistance to frozen storage was closely related to the membrane fatty acid composition. We interpreted this as an adaptation of S. thermophilus to the addition of oleic acid and the unfavorable growth conditions that corresponded to a low fermentation pH.
TI  - Effects of the mur1 mutation on xyloglucans produced by suspension-cultured Arabidopsis thaliana cells.
AB  - Mutation of the Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. gene MUR1, which encodes an isoform of GDP-D-mannose-4,6-dehydratase, affects the biosynthetic conversion of GDP-mannose to GDP-fucose. Cell walls in the aerial tissues of mur1 plants are almost devoid of alpha-L-fucosyl residues, which are partially replaced by closely related alpha-L-galactosyl residues. A line of suspension-cultured A. thaliana cells was generated from leaves of mur1 plants and the structure of the xyloglucan in the walls of these cells was structurally characterized. Xyloglucan fractions were prepared from the walls of both wild-type (WT) and mur1 cells by sequential extraction with a xyloglucan-specific endoglucanase (XEG) and aqueous KOH. Structural analysis of these fractions revealed that xyloglucan produced by cultured mur1 cells is similar, but not identical to that isolated from leaves of mur1 plants. As previously reported for mur1 leaves, the xyloglucan from cultured mur1 cells contains less than 5% of the fucose present in the xyloglucan from WT cells. Fucosylation of the xyloglucan is substantially restored when mur1 cells are grown in medium supplemented with L-fucose. Xyloglucan isolated from leaves contains more oligosaccharide subunits in which the central sidechain is terminated with a beta-D-galactosyl residue than does xyloglucan prepared from cultured cells. This was observed for both mur1 and WT plants, indicating that this correlation is independent of the mur1 mutation and that it is possible to distinguish changes due to genetic mutation from those due to the physiological state of the cells in culture. Suspension-cultured cells thus provide a convenient source of genetically altered cell wall material, facilitating the biochemical characterization of mutations that affect cell wall structure.
TI  - Genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity of Streptococcus thermophilus strains isolated from dairy products.
AB  - AIMS: Forty strains of Streptococcus thermophilus isolated from dairy products were identified and typed by a polyphasic approach which included phenotypic and genotypic criteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: Strains were identified by sugar fermentation pattern and species-specific PCR. Phenotypic diversity was evaluated by a chemometric model taking into account some biochemical characteristics (e.g. acidifying and peptidase activities) of technological interest. Genotypic diversity was evidenced by PCR fingerprinting. The overall phenotypic and genotypic information was elaborated on a multivariate statistical basis by principal components analysis and cluster analysis, respectively. When acidifying and peptidase activities were considered, PCA indicated that most of the strains isolated from Pecorino Toscano cheese were separable from the others. Similarly, most of the starter culture strains tended to separate from the cheese isolates. CONCLUSIONS: A wide strain heterogeneity among Strep. thermophilus strains isolated from dairy products was observed. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: A computerized analysis of genotypic and phenotypic information could be applied successfully to differentiate and characterize reliably and rapidly isolates occurring in different dairy products and to comprehend the technological role of specific Strep. thermophilus strains in dairy technology.
TI  - Effects of probiotic administration upon the composition and enzymatic activity of human fecal microbiota in patients with irritable bowel syndrome or functional diarrhea.
AB  - In a clinical trial, 10 patients suffering from irritable bowel syndrome or functional diarrhea were administered the probiotic preparation VSL-3. Preliminary results indicated that administration of VSL-3 improved the clinical picture and changed the composition and biochemistry of fecal microbiota. Titer variations of intestinal bacterial groups were evaluated by culture and PCR techniques. A significant increase in lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and Streptococcus thermophilus was observed as a consequence of probiotic treatment, while enterococci, coliforms, Bacteroides and Clostridium perfringens did not change significantly. The strains Bifidobacterium infantis Y1 and Bifidobacterium breve Y8, included in VSL-3, were specifically detected in feces of patients treated with the probiotic by using strain-specific PCR primers. In addition, fecal beta-galactosidase increased and urease activities decreased as a result of changes in the intestinal microbiota induced by VSL-3 administration.
TI  - Biofilm formation on voice prostheses: in vitro influence of probiotics.
AB  - In order to determine the influence of probiotic bacteria on biofilm formation on Groningen and Provox 2 voice prostheses in an artificial throat, we grew biofilms on both types of voice prostheses and exposed them 3 times daily to a probiotic bacterial suspension. As a control, we perfused an artificial throat with phosphate-buffered saline solution. Perfusion with Lactococcus lactis 53 suspension reduced the percentage numbers of bacteria and yeasts, respectively, on the Groningen prostheses to 17% and 22% and on the Provox 2 prostheses to 19% and 45%, compared to the number of colony-forming units on the control prosthesis, which was set at 100%. A suspension of Streptococcus thermophilus B reduced the percentage numbers of bacteria and yeasts, respectively, on the Groningen prostheses to 53% and 33% and on the Provox 2 prostheses to 14% and 0%, as compared to the control prosthesis. All other probiotic strains tested caused some reduction in the percentages of bacteria or yeasts, but strong differences between the types of prostheses were observed. In conclusion, L. lactis 53 and S. thermophilus B strongly reduce the occurrence of yeasts and bacteria in voice prosthetic biofilms.
TI  - Three oligopeptide-binding proteins are involved in the oligopeptide transport of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The functions necessary for bacterial growth strongly depend on the features of the bacteria and the components of the growth media. Our objective was to identify the functions essential to the optimum growth of Streptococcus thermophilus in milk. Using random insertional mutagenesis on a S. thermophilus strain chosen for its ability to grow rapidly in milk, we obtained several mutants incapable of rapid growth in milk. We isolated and characterized one of these mutants in which an amiA1 gene encoding an oligopeptide-binding protein (OBP) was interrupted. This gene was a part of an operon containing all the components of an ATP binding cassette transporter. Three highly homologous amiA genes encoding OBPs work with the same components of the ATP transport system. Their simultaneous inactivation led to a drastic diminution in the growth rate in milk and the absence of growth in chemically defined medium containing peptides as the nitrogen source. We constructed single and multiple negative mutants for AmiAs and cell wall proteinase (PrtS), the only proteinase capable of hydrolyzing casein oligopeptides outside the cell. Growth experiments in chemically defined medium containing peptides indicated that AmiA1, AmiA2, and AmiA3 exhibited overlapping substrate specificities, and that the whole system allows the transport of peptides containing from 3 to 23 residues.
TI  - Small-scale analysis of exopolysaccharides from Streptococcus thermophilus grown  in a semi-defined medium.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Exopolysaccharides (EPSs) produced by lactic acid bacteria are important for the texture of fermented foods and have received a great deal of interest recently. However, the low production levels of EPSs in combination with the complex media used for growth of the bacteria have caused problems in the accurate analysis of the EPS. The purpose of this study was to find a growth medium for physiological studies of the lactic acid bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus, and to develop a simple method for qualitative and quantitative analysis of EPSs produced in this medium. RESULTS: A semi-defined polysaccharide medium was developed and evaluated on six strains of Streptococcus thermophilus. The EPSs were analysed using a novel protocol incorporating ultracentrifugation for the removal of interfering sugars, hydrolysis and analysis of the monomer composition by High Performance Anion-Exchange Chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection. The medium and analysis method allowed accurate quantification and monomer analysis of 0.5 ml samples of EPSs from tube cultures. CONCLUSIONS: The presented medium should be useful for physiological studies of S. thermophilus, and, in combination with the method of analysis of EPS, will allow downscaling of physiological studies and screening for EPSs.
TI  - Comparative genomics reveals close genetic relationships between phages from dairy bacteria and pathogenic Streptococci: evolutionary implications for prophage-host interactions.
AB  - The genome of the highly pathogenic M1 serotype Streptococcus pyogenes isolate SF370 contains eight prophage elements. Only prophage SF370.1 could be induced by mitomycin C treatment. Prophage SF370.3 showed a 33.5-kb-long genome that closely resembled the genome organization of the cos-site temperate Siphovirus r1t infecting the dairy bacterium Lactococcus lactis. The two-phage genomes shared between 60 and 70% nucleotide sequence identity over the DNA packaging, head and tail genes. Analysis of the SF370.3 genome revealed mutations in the replisome organizer gene that may prevent the induction of the prophage. The mutated phage replication gene was closely related to a virulence marker identified in recently emerged M3 serotype S. pyogenes strains in Japan. This observation suggests that prophage genes confer selective advantage to the lysogenic host. SF370.3 encodes a hyaluronidase and a DNase that may facilitate the spreading of S. pyogenes through tissue planes of its human host. Prophage SF370.2 showed a 43-kb-long genome that closely resembled the genome organization of pac-site temperate Siphoviridae infecting the dairy bacteria S. thermophilus and L. lactis. Over part of the structural genes, the similarity between SF370.2 and S. thermophilus phage O1205 extended to the nucleotide sequence level. SF370.2 showed two probable inactivating mutations: one in the replisome organizer gene and another in the gene encoding the portal protein. Prophage SF370.2 also encodes a hyaluronidase and in addition two very likely virulence factors: prophage-encoded toxins acting as superantigens that may contribute to the immune deregulation observed during invasive streptococcal infections. The superantigens are encoded between the phage lysin and the right attachment site of the prophage genome. The genes were nearly sequence identical with a DNA segment in S. equi, suggesting horizontal gene transfer. The trend for prophage genome inactivation was even more evident for the remaining five prophage sequences that showed massive losses of prophage DNA. In these prophage remnants only 13-0.3 kb of putative prophage DNA was detected. We discuss the genomics data from S. pyogenes strain SF370 within the framework of Darwinian coevolution of prophages and lysogenic bacteria and suggest elements of genetic cooperation and elements of an arms race in this host-parasite relationship.
TI  - Effect of feeding yogurt versus milk in children with acute diarrhea and carbohydrate malabsorption.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to compare the effect of infant formula and the same formula subjected to microbial fermentation (yogurt) on the duration of diarrhea in young children with acute watery diarrhea, with or without reducing substances in stools. METHODS: One hundred twelve well-nourished children, aged 3 to 24 months, who were admitted to the hospital with acute watery diarrhea were included in a randomized trial. After appropriate rehydration, they were fed either an infant formula (group M, n = 56) or the same formula fermented with Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus (group Y, n = 56). The two feedings were comparable in lactose concentration (40 to 42 g/L), pH 4.5, flavor, and texture. The groups were subdivided into those with or without reducing sugars in stools at presentation. The presence of reducing sugars in stool was used as a marker of carbohydrate malabsorption. RESULTS: Group M and group Y had comparable clinical characteristics at admission, including the number of patients with reducing sugars in stools (n = 31 in group M and 27 in group Y). The success rate (cessation of diarrhea and appropriate weight gain 7 days after enrollment into the study) was similar in both groups (82% in group M vs. 84% group Y). Clinical failure was 3.6% in both groups. The percentage of patients withdrawn from the study for medical reasons (5.4% in group M vs. 7.1% in group Y) or withdrawn at the parents' request (8.9% in group M vs. 5.4% in group Y) was similar. Duration of diarrhea and number of stools were significantly less in group Y compared with group M. Forty-eight hours after inclusion, diarrhea was still present in 62% of group M versus in 35% of group Y (P < 0.002). In children with reducing sugars in stools, the rate of success (82%) was similar in groups M and Y, but the duration of diarrhea and number of stools per day were significantly decreased in group Y. Forty-height hours after inclusion, diarrhea was still present in 75% of group M patients and in 20% of group Y patients who had reducing substances in the stool. CONCLUSION: Young children with acute watery diarrhea, without malnutrition or associated disease, can be equally well treated with feeding of either infant formula or yogurt. Yogurt feeding is associated with a clinically relevant decrease in stool frequency and duration of diarrhea in children who have reducing sugars in stools.
TI  - Heterologous expression and characterization of the exopolysaccharide from Streptococcus thermophilus Sfi39.
AB  - The genes responsible for exopolysaccharide (EPS) synthesis in Streptococcus thermophilus Sfi39 were identified on a 20-kb genomic fragment. The two genes, epsE and epsG, were shown to be involved in EPS synthesis as their disruption lead to the loss of the ropy phenotype. Several naturally selected nonropy mutants were isolated, one acquired an insertion sequence (IS)-element (IS905) in the middle of the eps gene cluster. The eps gene cluster was cloned and transferred into a nonEPS-producing heterologous host, Lactococcus lactis MG1363. The EPS produced was shown by chemical analysis and NMR spectroscopy to be identical to the EPS produced by S. thermophilus Sfi39. This demonstrated first that all genes needed for EPS production and export were present in the S. thermophilus Sfi39 eps gene cluster, and second that the heterologous production of an EPS was possible by transfer of the complete eps gene cluster alone, provided that the heterologous host possessed all necessary genetic information for precursor synthesis.
TI  - Contribution of Gal- lactic acid bacteria to Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolic activity in milk.
AB  - The contemporaneous presence of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus affected the growth kinetics of Saccharomyces cerevisiae PZ2 and the metabolic products of their growth were quantitatively and qualitatively different from those produced by single strains inoculated alone. S. cerevisiae can grow in milk without using lactose or galactose. In particular, the presence of peptides seems to be sufficient to ensure its growth. The growth of S. cerevisiae with lactic acid bacteria is characterised by stimulatory effects that involve both yeast and bacteria. However, the release of galactose by lactic acid bacteria does not seem to be the core metabolic event of these stimulatory effects on S. cerevisiae.
TI  - Prevention by lactic acid bacteria of the oxidation of human LDL.
AB  - Ether extracts of lactic acid bacteria were analyzed for prevention of the oxidation of erythrocyte membrane and human low-density lipoprotein in vivo. Streptococcus thermophilus 1131 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 2038, yogurt starters, were chosen as test-strains, and ether extracts of these cultures were used as samples. Both strain 1131 and strain 2038 produced radical scavengers and inhibited oxidation of erythrocyte membranes and low-density lipoproteins. The antioxidative activity of strain 2038 was higher than that of strain 1131.
TI  - Challenge testing of the lactoperoxidase system in pasteurized milk.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the role of lactoperoxidase (LP) in inhibiting the growth of micro-organisms in pasteurised milk. METHODS AND RESULTS: Four micro-organisms of importance in the spoilage of pasteurized milk were challenged in lactoperoxidase (LP)-enriched ultra-heat treated (UHT) milk after subsequent pasteurization. Milk samples were stored at the optimum temperatures for growth of the individual bacteria. Pasteurization was carried out at 72 degrees C/15 s and 80 degrees C/15 s to determine the effect of the LP system on the micro-organisms. An active LP system was found to greatly increase the keeping quality (KQ) of milks inoculated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus thermophilus and pasteurized at 72 degrees C, but had little or no effect in milks heated at 80 degrees C, presumably due to virtual inactivation of LP at 80 degrees C. However, pasteurization temperature had no effect on the KQ of milks challenged with Bacillus cereus spores. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the LP system, rather than heat-shocking of spores, is responsible for the greater KQ of milk pasteurized at 72 degrees C/15 s compared with 80 degrees C/15 s. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The study emphasizes the care required in selecting pasteurization temperatures in commercial practice and to avoid the temptation to compensate for inferior quality of raw milk by increasing pasteurization temperature.
TI  - Reduction of oxaluria after an oral course of lactic acid bacteria at high concentration.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hyperoxaluria is a major risk factor for renal stones, and in most cases, it appears to be sustained by increased dietary load or increased intestinal absorption. Previous studies have shown that components of the endogenous digestive microflora, in particular Oxalobacter formigenes, utilize oxalate in the gut, thus limiting its absorption. We tested the hypothesis of whether oxaluria can be reduced by means of reducing intestinal absorption through feeding a mixture of freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria. METHODS: Six patients with idiopathic calcium-oxalate urolithiasis and mild hyperoxaluria (>40 mg/24 h) received daily a mixture containing 8 x 10(11) freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria (L. acidophilus, L. plantarum, L. brevis, S. thermophilus, B. infantis) for four weeks. The 24-hour urinary excretion of oxalate was determined at the end of the study period and then one month after ending the treatment. The ability of bacteria to degrade oxalate and grow in oxalate-containing media, and the gene expression of Ox1T, an enzyme that catalyzes the transmembrane exchange of oxalate, also were investigated. RESULTS: The treatment resulted in a great reduction of the 24-hour excretion of oxalate in all six patients enrolled. Mean levels +/- SD were 33.5 +/- 15.9 mg/24 h at the end of the study period and 28.3 +/- 14.6 mg/24 h one month after treatment was interrupted compared with baseline values of 55.5 +/- 19.6 mg/24 h (P < 0.05). The treatment was associated with a strong reduction of the fecal excretion of oxalate in the two patients tested. Two bacterial strains among those used for the treatment (L. acidophilus and S. thermophilus) proved in vitro to degrade oxalate effectively, but their growth was somewhat inhibited by oxalate. One strain (B. infantis) showed a quite good degrading activity and grew rapidly in the oxalate-containing medium. L. plantarum and L. brevis showed a modest ability to degrade oxalate even though they grew significantly in oxalate-containing medium. No strain expressed the Ox1T gene. CONCLUSIONS: The urinary excretion of oxalate, a major risk factor for renal stone formation and growth in patients with idiopathic calcium-oxalate urolithiasis, can be greatly reduced with treatment using a high concentration of freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria. We postulate that the biological manipulation of the endogenous digestive microflora can be a novel approach for the prevention of urinary stone formation.
TI  - Survival of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus in the terminal ileum of fistulated Gottingen minipigs.
AB  - The ability of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus administered in yogurt to survive the passage through the upper gastrointestinal tract was investigated with Gottingen minipigs that were fitted with ileum T-cannulas. After ingestion of yogurt containing viable microorganisms, ileostomy samples were collected nearly every hour beginning 3 h after food uptake. Living L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus were detected in the magnitude of 10(6) to 10(7) per gram of intestinal contents (wet weight) in all animals under investigation. A calculation of the minimum amount of surviving bacteria that had been administered is presented. Total DNA extracted from ileostomy samples was subjected to PCR, which was species specific for L. delbrueckii and S. thermophilus and subspecies specific for L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. All three bacterial groups could be detected by PCR after yogurt uptake but not after uptake of a semisynthetic diet. One pig apparently had developed an endogenous L. delbrueckii flora. When heat-treated yogurt was administered, L. delbrueckii was detected in all animals. S. thermophilus or L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus was not detected, indicating that heat-inactivated cells and their DNAs had already been digested and their own L. delbrueckii flora had been stimulated for growth.
TI  - UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 4-epimerase activity indicates the presence of N-acetylgalactosamine in exopolysaccharides of Streptococcus thermophilus strains.
AB  - The monomer composition of the exopolysaccharides (EPS) produced by Streptococcus thermophilus LY03 and S. thermophilus Sfi20 were evaluated by high-pressure liquid chromatography with amperometric detection and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Both strains produced the same EPS composed of galactose, glucose, and N-acetylgalactosamine. Further, it was demonstrated that the activity of the precursor-producing enzyme UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 4-epimerase, converting UDP-N-acetylglucosamine into UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine, is responsible for the presence of N-acetylgalactosamine in the EPS repeating units of both strains. The activity of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 4-epimerase was higher in both S. thermophilus strains than in a non-EPS-producing control strain. However, the level of this activity was not correlated with EPS yields, a result independent of the carbohydrate source applied in the fermentation process. On the other hand, both the amounts of EPS and the carbohydrate consumption rates were influenced by the type of carbohydrate source used during S. thermophilus Sfi20 fermentations. A correlation between activities of the enzymes alpha-phosphoglucomutase, UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, and UDP-galactose 4-epimerase and EPS yields was seen. These experiments confirm earlier observed results for S. thermophilus LY03, although S. thermophilus Sfi20 preferentially consumed glucose for EPS production instead of lactose in contrast to the former strain.
TI  - Development and sensory evaluation of soy milk based yoghurt.
AB  - Yoghurts were prepared by fermentation of soy milk using a mixed starter culture  containing Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Soy milk at 9 degrees Brix was homogenised under pressure (17 MPa) and fermented with and without addition of sucrose (2.0 and 2.5 g per 100 g) for 4, 5, 6 and 7 hours. The yoghurts were evaluated in terms of sensory quality, pH, titrable acidity, phytic acid and oligosaccharides: A yoghurt with the best sensory quality was obtained using the homogenised soy milk with 2% sucrose addition and fermented for 6 h. Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus did not produce phytases and alpha-galactosidases at the experimental conditions, consequently, phytic acid and galactosides were not affected by the process.
TI  - [Viability and activity of the lactic bacteria (Streptococcus salivarius ssp thermophilus y Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp bulgaricus) del yogurt en Venezuela].
AB  - National and international legislations have agreed that the population of lactic bacteria in yogurt must be viable and not less than 10(6) ufc/g. In Venezuela, during last years, observations indicate that the number of viable cells in some commercial samples show high variations, as low levels. This research attempted to find the origin of this problem in the local industry. For this purpose 105 commercial samples were analyzed during their shelf life and 32 samples of yogurt prepared in the laboratory following the flow diagram of the local industry. The different conditions of freeze dried lactic culture, were also analyzed. These samples were evaluated for viable cell count of lactic bacteria and possible variations of pH and acidity. The absence or low number of lactic bacteria detected in some commercial samples is due to the use of inadequate working cultures that show imbalanced proportions of the two microorganisms, besides a low count below 106 ufc/g. The succesive propagation and storage time of mother culture, and the overacidification of the product, produce subletal injury to the microbial cells of the yogurt starter culture. The data indicate that manufacturing practices significantly affect the survival of the lactic flora.
TI  - Streptococcus thermophilus in cheddar cheese--production and fate of galactose.
AB  - The behaviour of Streptococcus thermophilus in combination with Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris or subsp. lactis mesophilic starters in experimental Cheddar cheese is reported. In a standard manufacturing procedure employing a 38 degrees C cook temperature, even very low levels (0.007%) of Str. thermophilus combined with normal levels of the mesophilic starter (1.7%) resulted in increased rates of acid production, the formation of significant amounts of galactose (approximately 13 mmol/kg cheese), and populations nearly equivalent to those of the mesophilic lactic starter in the curd before salting. At a 41 degrees C cook temperature, the Str. thermophilus attained a higher maximum population (approximately log 8.2 colony forming units (cfu)/g) than the Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris (approximately log 6.8 cfu/g) and formed more galactose (approximately 28 mmol/kg). Lactobacillus rhamnosus, deliberately added to a cheese made using Str. thermophilus starter and which contained 24 mmol galactose/kg at day one, utilized all the galactose during the first 3 months of cheese ripening. Adventitious non-starter lactic acid bacteria had the potential to utilize this substrate too, and a close relationship was demonstrated between the increase in this flora and the disapearance of the galactose. Some possible consequences for cheese quality of using Str. thermophilus as a starter component are discussed.
TI  - Hydrogen peroxide effects on Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ368 cell viability.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ368 is an anaerobic aerotolerant bacteria and its  ability to survive under aerobic growth conditions raises the question of the existence of a putative defence system against oxidative stress. Thus, survival of CNRZ368 in the presence of increasing concentrations of hydrogen peroxide was studied. Moreover, the influence of the physiologic state of the cells, as well as that of a preexposition with sublethal doses of hydrogen peroxide, upon S. thermophilus CNRZ368 survival were determined. The results suggest that S. thermophilus displays a defence system against oxidative stress and that this system is inducible.
TI  - Solution structure and function of a conserved protein SP14.3 encoded by an essential Streptococcus pneumoniae gene.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major human pathogen that causes high mortality and morbidity rates and has developed resistance to many antibiotics. The genome of S. pneumoniae has recently been completely sequenced revealing many genes encoding hypothetical proteins of unknown function. We have found that the gene encoding one such conserved protein, SP14.3, is essential for growth of S. pneumonia. Since it is essential, SP14.3 represents a potential target for drug discovery. Here, we describe the three-dimensional solution structure of SP14.3 as determined by NMR spectroscopy. The structure consists of two domains each with an alpha/beta-fold. The N-terminal domain contains two alpha-helices and a three-stranded beta-sheet, while the C-terminal domain is composed of one alpha-helix and a five-stranded beta-sheet. The N-terminal domain of the protein contains a highly negatively charged surface and resembles the fold of the N-terminal domain of Thermus thermophilus ribosomal protein S3. The C-terminal domain has a protein fold similar to human small nuclear ribonucleoprotein Sm D3 and Haloarcula marismortui ribosomal protein L21E. The two domains of the protein tumble in solution overall as a whole with an overall molecular rotational correlation time (tau(m)) of 12.9 ns at 25 degrees C. The relative orientation of the two domains is not defined by the nuclear Overhauser effect data. Indeed, residual dipolar couplings and the structure calculations indicate that the relative orientation of the two domains is not rigidly oriented with respect to one another in solution.
TI  - Identification of a genetic determinant responsible for host specificity in Streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophages.
AB  - Phage-host interactions remain poorly understood in lactic acid bacteria and essentially in all Gram-positive bacteria. The aim of this study was to identify the phage genetic determinant (anti-receptor) involved in the recognition of Streptococcus thermophilus hosts. The complete genomic sequence of the lytic S. thermophilus phage DT1 was determined previously, and bioinformatic analysis indicated that orf18 might be the anti-receptor gene. The orf18 of six additional S. thermophilus phages was determined (DT2, DT4, MD1, MD2, MD4 and Q5) and compared with the orf18 of DT1. The deduced ORF18 was divided into three domains. The first domain, which contains the N-terminal part of the protein, was conserved in all seven phages. The second domain was detected in only two phages and flanked by a motif called collagen-like repeats. The second domain also contained a variable region (VR1). All seven phages had a third domain that consisted of the C-terminal section of the protein as well as another variable region (VR2). Chimeric DT1 phages were constructed by recombination; a portion of its orf18 was replaced by the corresponding section in orf18 of the phage MD4. All DT1 chimeric phages acquired the host range of phage MD4. Analysis of the orf18 in the chimeric phages revealed that host specificity in phages DT1 and MD4 resulted from VR2. This is the first report on the identification and characterization of a phage gene involved in the host recognition process of Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Detection of extracellular bound proteinase in EPS-producing lactic acid bacteria cultures on skim milk agar.
AB  - AIMS: Skim milk agar was developed to investigate extracellular cell-bound proteinase in yogurt cultures, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Lact. bulgaricus cultures produced more extracellular cell-bound proteinase than did Strep. thermophilus cultures. Strong positive correlations between the size of the exopolysaccharide (EPS) layer and extracellular cell-bound proteinase were found for both Streptococcus and Lactobacillus cultures. CONCLUSION: Strong positive linear relationships existed between the EPS size and colony size and the diameter of clear zone and colony size for Streptococcus cultures, whereas weak positive linear relationships were observed for Lactobacillus cultures. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These data are useful to validate the relationship between extracellular proteinase and the EPS size of LAB. Also, a convenient medium to detect the presence of extracellular cell-bound proteinase of LAB is valuable for dairy industries.
TI  - Production of growth-inhibiting factors by Lactobacillus delbrueckii.
AB  - AIMS: The detection of growth-inhibiting factors produced by Lactobacillus delbrueckii. METHODS AND RESULTS: A bioscreen assay was developed to study the effect of Lact. delbrueckii culture supernatant fluids on the growth of phylogenically or functionally related bacteria in broth cultures. Several growth-inhibiting factors could be distinguished based on differential effects on different test strains, separation by ultrafiltration and sensitivity to heat, proteinase treatment or catalase addition. CONCLUSION: Lactobacillus delbrueckii strain VI1007 was found to produce at least three growth-inhibiting factors, other than lactic acid, when grown under microaerobic conditions in MRS broth. These included H2O2 and a bacteriocin-like, heat- and proteinase-sensitive bactericidal molecule or complex with a molecular weight greater than 50 kDa. A third factor inhibited the growth of Streptococcus thermophilus. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The assay system used allows the detection of subtle interactions between strains, that are likely to be of ecological importance in mixed cultures but would go unnoticed in classical agar diffusion tests.
TI  - Identification of the DNA-binding protein, HrcA, of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - HrcA is a negative transcriptional factor controlling the expression of the stress-specific operons dnaK and groESL in several bacteria. Although the HrcA structural gene has been identified in various organisms, studies at the protein level have been so far limited and mostly restricted to Bacillus subtilis. We have identified the HrcA protein of Streptococcus thermophilus and show here that it is a dimer with a native molecular mass of 74.5 kDa and a sequence-specific DNA-binding activity. Partially denatured and inactive S. thermophilus HrcA recovered its binding activity in the presence of the GroEL chaperone.
TI  - Exopolysaccharide-producing strains of thermophilic lactic acid bacteria cluster  into groups according to their EPS structure.
AB  - AIMS: To compare galactose-negative strains of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subspecies bulgaricus isolated from fermented milk products and known to produce exopolysaccharides (EPSs). METHODS AND RESULTS: The structures of the EPSs were determined using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and their genetic relationships determined using restriction endonuclease analysis (REA) and random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD). Similar groupings were apparent by REA and RAPD, and each group produced an EPS with a particular subunit structure. CONCLUSION: Although none of the strains assimilated galactose, all inserted a high proportion of galactose into their EPS when grown in skimmed milk, and fell into three distinct groups. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This information should help in an understanding of genetic exchanges in lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Insertional mutagenesis of an industrial strain of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Random mutagenesis of an industrial strain of Streptococcus thermophilus was achieved through an adapted version of a two-plasmid system. The mutagenesis strategy is based on random integration of derivatives of the non-replicative (Rep(-)) plasmid pORI19 by means of homologous recombination following a temperature shift that eliminates replication of the temperature-sensitive (Rep(ts)) helper plasmid pVE6007. In this way mutants were generated which were affected in bacteriophage sensitivity or sucrose metabolism. Homologues were identified of a protein related to folate metabolism from a bacteriophage-resistant mutant and of two subunits of an oligopeptide transport system from a mutant deficient in sucrose utilisation.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a Streptococcus thermophilus plasmid closely related to the pMV158 family.
AB  - Twenty-two Streptococcus thermophilus strains used for milk fermentations were analyzed for their plasmid content and 13 of them (59%) were found to contain one or two plasmids. Fifteen S. thermophilus plasmids were divided into four groups using DNA homology. Ten plasmids were classified within group A and they shared homologies with all the previously sequenced S. thermophilus plasmids. Three plasmids (group B) hybridized with each other and two plasmids only hybridized with themselves (groups C and D). Single-stranded DNA was detected within strains containing plasmids of groups A, C, and D, indicating that they replicate via a rolling-circle mode. The only plasmid of group C, named pSMQ172, was further characterized. This 4230-bp plasmid replicates in Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis, and Streptococcus salivarius and does not confer phage resistance. Comparisons with databases showed that pSMQ172 was related to pMV158 of Streptococcus agalactiae and to pSSU1 of Streptococcus suis. These results suggest that genetic exchanges may have occurred between pathogenic and nonpathogenic streptococci.
TI  - Structural characterisation of the exopolysaccharide produced by Streptococcus thermophilus EU20.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus EU20 when grown on skimmed milk secretes a high-molecular-weight exopolysaccharide that is composed of glucose, galactose and rhamnose in a molar ratio of 2:3:2. Using chemical techniques and 1D and 2D-NMR spectroscopy (1H and 13C) the polysaccharide has been shown to possess a heptasaccharide repeating unit having the following structure: [chemical structure: see text]. Treatment of the polysaccharide with mild acid (0.5 M TFA, 100 degrees C for 1 h) liberates two oligosaccharides; the components correspond to the repeating unit and a hexasaccharide equivalent to the repeating unit minus the terminal alpha-L-Rhap.
TI  - A randomized clinical trial of the effect of yoghurt on the human salivary microflora.
AB  - Yoghurt is active against some human pathogens, so this experiment tested whether it is also active against the salivary microflora. A clinical trial was designed, with volunteers aged between 23 and 37 years. Initially, for 8 weeks, they consumed neither yoghurt nor casein-free soybean ice cream (phase 1). They were then split randomly into test (yoghurt) and control (ice cream) groups and required to consume 125 g of these foods twice daily for 8 weeks (phase 2) and then to avoid them for the following 2 weeks (phase 3). Many potential sources of microbial fluctuation were standardized. Salivary samples were then collected at regular intervals of 2 weeks. For each group and phase, the mean logarithms of the salivary counts for total viable flora, oral streptococci, mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and Candida were calculated. The prevalence of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus was also assessed. Twenty test and 22 control participants completed the study. At phase 2, the mean for mutans streptococci was lower in the test than in the control group (3.6 vs. 4.0 log colony-forming units/ml; P=0.02). Moreover, the mean had decreased in all test participants with high phase 1 means for lactobacilli as compared to only 36.4% of those with low phase 1 means (P=0.01). L. bulgaricus was transiently detected in three test participants during phase 2. These results suggest that yoghurt does have some activity against the salivary microflora, but this does not seem to be due to the installation of yoghurt microorganisms in the mouth.
TI  - Requirement for phosphoglucomutase in exopolysaccharide biosynthesis in glucose-  and lactose-utilizing Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - To study the influence of phosphoglucomutase (PGM) activity on exopolysaccharide  (EPS) synthesis in glucose- and lactose-growing Streptococcus thermophilus, a knockout PGM mutant and a strain with elevated PGM activity were constructed. The pgmA gene, encoding PGM in S. thermophilus LY03, was identified and cloned. The gene was functional in Escherichia coli and was shown to be expressed from its own promoter. The pgmA-deficient mutant was unable to grow on glucose, while the mutation did not affect growth on lactose. Overexpression of pgmA had no significant effect on EPS production in glucose-growing cells. Neither deletion nor overexpression of pgmA changed the growth or EPS production on lactose. Thus, the EPS precursors in lactose-utilizing S. thermophilus are most probably formed from the galactose moiety of lactose via the Leloir pathway, which circumvents the need for a functional PGM.
TI  - [Divergence in the level of DNA hybridization and formation of sibling species in the lactic acid bacteria Streptococcus thermophilus].
AB  - Previously, five distinct groups with 80-90% intragroup DNA homology values were  revealed among 19 lactic acid-producing bacterial strains. The study of 39 new strains of thermophilic streptococci in the present work allowed us to reveal the sixth DNA homology group. The nine strains of this group are similar, at 55-70% DNA homology levels, to the type strain S. thermophilus ATCC 19258. Group VI showed a low level of DNA-DNA reassociation (20-30%) with the DNA homology groups I, II, III, and V. The intergroup DNA-DNA reassociation values determined from DNA renaturation rates varied from 20 to 50%. These data were interpreted as indicative of the existence of at least four sibling species among the thermophilic streptococci studied.
TI  - Comparative genomics of lactococcal phages: insight from the complete genome sequence of Lactococcus lactis phage BK5-T.
AB  - Lactococcus lactis phage BK5-T and Streptococcus thermophilus phage Sfi21, two cos-site temperate Siphoviridae with 40-kb genomes, share an identical genome organization, sequence similarity at the amino acid level over about half of their genomes, and nucleotide sequence identity of 60% over the DNA packaging and head morphogenesis modules. Siphoviridae with similarly organized genomes and substantial protein sequence similarity were identified in several genera of low-GC-content Gram-positive bacteria. These phages demonstrated a gradient of relatedness ranging from nucleotide sequence similarity to protein sequence similarity to gene map similarity over the DNA packaging and head morphogenesis modules. Interestingly, the degree of relatedness was correlated with the evolutionary distance separating their bacterial hosts. These observations suggest elements of vertical evolution in phages. The structural genes from BK5-T shared no sequence relationships with corresponding genes/proteins from lactococcal phages belonging to distinct lactococcal phage species, including phage sk1 (phage species 936) that showed a closely related gene map. Despite a clearly distinct genome organization, lactococcal phages sk1 and c2 showed nine sequence-related proteins. Over the early gene cluster phage BK5-T shared nine regions of high nucleotide sequence similarity, covering at most two adjacent genes, with lactococcal phage r1t (phage species P335). Over the structural genes, the closest relatives of phage r1t were not lactococcal phages belonging to other phage species, but Siphoviridae from Mycobacteria (high-GC-content Gram-positive bacteria). Evidence for recent horizontal gene transfer between distinct phage species was obtained for dairy phages, but these transfers were limited to phages infecting the same bacterial host species.
TI  - Structure of the exopolysaccharide produced by Streptococcus thermophilus S3.
AB  - The exopolysaccharide of Streptococcus thermophilus S3, produced in skimmed milk, is composed of D-galactose and L-rhamnose in a molar ratio of 2:1. The polysaccharide contains 0.4 equiv of O-acetyl groups per repeating unit. Linkage analysis and 1D/2D NMR (1H and 13C) studies on native and O-deacetylated EPS together with nanoES-CID tandem mass spectrometry studies on oligosaccharides generated by a periodate oxidation protocol, show the polysaccharide to have the following structure: [structure: see text].
TI  - Development of Streptococcus thermophilus lacZ as a reporter gene for Candida albicans.
AB  - The study of gene regulation in many organisms has been facilitated by the development of reporter genes. The authors report the use of lacZ from Streptococcus thermophilus, a gene encoding a beta-galactosidase, as a reporter for the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. As test cases, Strep. thermophilus lacZ was placed under control of three different C. albicans promoters: MAL2 (maltase), inducible by maltose; HWP1 (hyphal cell wall protein), induced by conditions that promote filamentous growth; and ACT1 (actin). These constructs were each integrated into the C. albicans genome and beta-galactosidase activity was readily detected from these strains, but only under the appropriate growth conditions. Beta-galactosidase activity could be detected by several methods: quantitative liquid assays using permeabilized cells, colorimetric assays of colonies replicated to paper filters, and in situ coloration of colonies growing on medium containing the indicator X-Gal. These results show the usefulness of STREP: thermophilus lacZ as a monitor of gene regulation in this medically important yeast.
TI  - Comparison of statistical methods for identification of Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium from randomly amplified polymorphic DNA patterns.
AB  - Thermophilic streptococci play an important role in the manufacture of many European cheeses, and a rapid and reliable method for their identification is needed. Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) PCR (RAPD-PCR) with two different primers coupled to hierarchical cluster analysis has proven to be a powerful tool for the classification and typing of Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, and Enterococcus faecalis (G. Moschetti, G. Blaiotta, M. Aponte, P. Catzeddu, F. Villani, P. Deiana, and S. Coppola, J. Appl. Microbiol. 85:25-36, 1998). In order to develop a fast and inexpensive method for the identification of thermophilic streptococci, RAPD-PCR patterns were generated with a single primer (XD9), and the results were analyzed using artificial neural networks (Multilayer Perceptron, Radial Basis Function network, and Bayesian network) and multivariate statistical techniques (cluster analysis, linear discriminant analysis, and classification trees). Cluster analysis allowed the identification of S. thermophilus but not of enterococci. A Bayesian network proved to be more effective than a Multilayer Perceptron or a Radial Basis Function network for the identification of S. thermophilus, E. faecium, and E. faecalis using simplified RAPD-PCR patterns (obtained by summing the bands in selected areas of the patterns). The Bayesian network also significantly outperformed two multivariate statistical techniques (linear discriminant analysis and classification trees) and proved to be less sensitive to the size of the training set and more robust in the response to patterns belonging to unknown species.
TI  - Thin layer chromatographic determination of organic acids for rapid identification of bifidobacteria at genus level.
AB  - This study presents a simple and fast method for the identification of bifidobacteria using a thin layer chromatographic (TLC) analysis of the short chain fatty acids in a culture broth. When the chromatogram was sprayed with the indicator solution (methyl red-bromophenol blue in 70% ethanol), lactic acid exhibited two red spots, and acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid all produced blue spots. Succinic acid and citric acid produced yellow and dark yellow spot, respectively. In addition, these organic acids showed different R(f) values. The total time taken to analyze the organic acids in the 10 bacterial culture broths using the proposed method was approximately 50 min. The proposed TLC method was used to analyze the organic acids in culture broths of the following strains, five Bifidobacterium species. (Bifidobacterium longum, B. breve, B. infantis, B. bifidum, and B. adolescentis) and five other lactic acid bacteria strains (Lactobacillus casei, L. bulgaricus, L. acidophilus, Streptococcus thermophilus, and S. lactis). Both spots of lactic acid and acetic acid were detected on all the TLC plates from the five bifidobacterial culture broths. The five other lactic acid bacterial culture broths, however, only exhibited lactic acid spots. Accordingly, the proposed TLC method would appear to be a useful tool for rapid identification of Bifidobacterium spp. at the genus level.
TI  - Microbiological and biochemical properties of canestrato pugliese hard cheese supplemented with bifidobacteria.
AB  - Canestrato Pugliese cheeses from ewe milk were produced according to a traditional protocol and by adding 7.0 log10 cfu of fresh cells per gram of Bifidobacterium bifidum Bb02, Bifidobacterium longum Bb46, or both species. The traditional technology was modified slightly to favor the survival of probiotic microorganisms. After 56 d of ripening, the survival of B. bifidum Bb02 and B. longum Bb46 was 6.0 and 5.0 log10 cfu/g, respectively. After 19 d cheeses contained ca. 7.0 log10 cfu/g of bifidobacteria. Compared to traditional cheese, the addition of bifidobacteria seemed to support the growth and survival of mesophilic lactobacilli and Streptococcus thermophilus, used as starter, during ripening. No significant differences were observed in the main chemical composition, and only a slightly higher concentration of acetic acid was found in cheeses with bifidobacteria added. On the contrary, alpha- and beta-galactosidase activities were markedly more pronounced in the presence of bifidobacteria, especially with B. bifidum Bb02. In contrast with traditional cheese, the lactose was completely hydrolyzed in cheeses made with bifidobacteria. Urea-PAGE electrophoresis of the pH 4.6-soluble and pH 4.6-insoluble N fractions did not show appreciable variations. Only the reversed-phase-HPLC analysis of the pH 4.6-soluble N showed a slightly more complex profile in the presence of bifidobacteria. This finding was in agreement with the higher value of the pH 4.6-soluble N/total N ratio and with the more pronounced amino-, imino-, and dipeptidase activities found in all the cheeses with the bifidobacteria added, especially B. bifidum Bb02. No differences were found in the free amino acid and free fatty acid contents. The amino acids glutamic acid, valine, proline, leucine, and lysine and the fatty acids butyric, caproic, capric, and oleic acids were found at the highest concentrations. The sensory evaluation did not show significant differences, and Canestrato Pugliese cheeses were characterized by small and uniformly distributed eyes, were pale yellow, had an elastic consistency and a Pecorino-like smell, were very salty, and tended to be moderately piquant.
TI  - Formulations and processing of yogurt affect the microbial quality of carbonated  yogurt.
AB  - Carbonation, flavor, culture type, pH, and storage time were varied to investigate the effects of these variables and their interactions on the growth of both typical and nontypical yogurt cultures and some contaminating bacteria. Two types of yogurt cultures (YC-470 and YC-180) were used as the source of typical yogurt bacteria, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. In addition, Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA-K) and Bifidobacterium longum ATCC 15707 were added as nontypical yogurt cultures to make sweetened low fat (1%) Swiss-style plain, strawberry, and lemon yogurts. Samples were incubated at 43 degrees C until pH values of 5.0 or 4.2 were reached. Strawberry yogurts at low (4.2) and high (5.0) pHs were divided into three portions, which were separately inoculated with contaminating bacteria, Bacillus licheniformis ATCC 14580, Escherichia coli ATCC 11775, and Listeria monocytogenes Scott A. After incorporation of carbon dioxide (1.10 to 1.27 volume of CO2 gas dissolved in water), the yogurt was stored at 4 degrees C for a 90-d period. Carbon dioxide did not affect the growth of typical or nontypical yogurt bacteria. Also, CO2 did not inhibit the growth of undesirable microorganisms. In general, low levels of CO2 did not affect the bacterial population in yogurt. The microflora of yogurt were influenced by culture type, pH, flavor type, and storage time or their interactions.
TI  - Application and evaluation of the interlaboratory reproducibility of tRNA intergenic length polymorphism analysis (tDNA-PCR) for identification of Streptococcus species.
AB  - The discriminatory power, speed, and interlaboratory reproducibility of tRNA intergenic length polymorphism analysis (tDNA-PCR) combined with capillary electrophoresis was evaluated for the identification of streptococci. This method was carried out in three different laboratories under highly standardized conditions for 54 strains belonging to 18 different species. It was concluded that interlaboratory reproducibility of tDNA fingerprints produced by means of capillary electrophoresis was sufficiently high to permit the exchange between different laboratories and the construction of common libraries which can be consulted for comparison with fingerprints obtained independently in separate laboratories. In a second step, 17 other species were included in the study and examined in one of the participating laboratories. All Streptococcus species studied, except S. mitis, S. oralis, S. parasanguinis, S. pneumoniae, S. thermophilus, and S. vestibularis, showed distinguishable tDNA fingerprints. A database of well-characterized strains was constructed to enable computer-aided identification of unknown streptococcal isolates.
TI  - Characterization of a novel type II restriction-modification system, Sth368I, encoded by the integrative element ICESt1 of Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ368.
AB  - A novel type II restriction and modification (R-M) system, Sth368I, which confers resistance to phiST84, was found in Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ368 but not in the very closely related strain A054. Partial sequencing of the integrative conjugative element ICESt1, carried by S. thermophilus CNRZ368 but not by A054, revealed a divergent cluster of two genes, sth368IR and sth368IM. The protein sequence encoded by sth368IR is related to the type II endonucleases R.LlaKR2I and R.Sau3AI, which recognize and cleave the sequence 5'-GATC-3'. The protein sequence encoded by sth368IM is very similar to numerous type II 5-methylcytosine methyltransferases, including M.LlaKR2I and M.Sau3AI. Cell extracts of CNRZ368 but not A054 were found to cleave at the GATC site. Furthermore, the C residue of the sequence 5'-GATC-3' was found to be methylated in CNRZ368 but not in A054. Cloning and integration of a copy of sth368IR and sth368IM in the A054 chromosome confers on this strain phenotypes similar to those of CNRZ368, i.e., phage resistance, endonuclease activity of cell extracts, and methylation of the sequence 5'-GATC-3'. Disruption of sth368IR removes resistance and restriction activity. We conclude that ICESt1 encodes an R-M system, Sth368I, which recognizes the sequence 5'-GATC-3' and is related to the Sau3AI and LlaKR2I restriction systems.
TI  - Efficient preparation of natural and synthetic galactosides with a recombinant beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase-/UDP-4'-gal epimerase fusion protein.
AB  - The numerous biological roles of LacNAc-based oligosaccharides have led to an increased demand for these structures for biological studies. In this report, an efficient route for the synthesis of beta-galactosides using a bacterial beta-4-galactosyltransferase/-UDP-4'-gal-epimerase fusion protein is described. The lgtB gene from Neisseria meningitidis and the galE gene from Streptococcus thermophilus were fused and cloned into an expression vector pCW. The fusion protein transfers galactose to a variety of different glucose- and glucosamine-containing acceptors, and utilizes either UDP-galactose or UDP-glucose as donor substrates. A crude lysate from Escherichia coli expressing the fusion protein is demonstrated to be sufficient for the efficient preparation of galactosylated oligosaccharides from inexpensive UDP-glucose in a multigram scale. Lysates containing the fusion protein are also found to be useful in the production of more complex oligosaccharides in coupled reaction mixtures, e.g., in the preparation of sialosides from N-acetylglucosamine. Thus, bacterially expressed fusion protein is well suited for the facile and economic preparation of natural oligosaccharides and synthetic derivatives based on the lactosamine core.
TI  - Identification, cloning, and expression of a functional phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (pheRS) from Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (pheRS) is unique among aminoacyl tRNA synthetases in that it is a heterotetrameric enzyme composed of two alpha-subunits and two larger beta-subunits. In prokaryotes, the alpha- and beta-subunits of pheRS are encoded by the genes pheS and pheT, respectively. In this report we describe the isolation of a DNA fragment (3.52 kb) containing the pheS and pheT genes from a Staphylococcus aureus (WCUH29) genomic DNA library. Both genes, found as a part of transcriptional operon, were predicted to encode polypeptides which showed strong primary and structural similarity to prokaryotic phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase alpha- and beta- subunits. We describe the high-level overexpression and purification of recombinant S. aureus pheRS using pheS and pheT genes as part of an artificial operon in Escherichia coli. For comparative analysis we also report a procedure for the purification of native pheRS from S. aureus (Oxford Strain) and demonstrate that Michaelis-Menten parameters for both recombinant and native enzyme, at least for phenylalanine tRNA aminoacylation are comparable.
TI  - Factors affecting capsule size and production by lactic acid bacteria used as dairy starter cultures.
AB  - The effects of sugar substrates on capsule size and production by some capsule-forming nonropy and ropy dairy starter cultures were studied. Test sugars (glucose, lactose, galactose, or sucrose) were used as a sole carbohydrate source and the presence of a capsule and its size were determined by using confocal scanning laser microscopy. Nonropy strains produced maximum capsule size when grown in milk. Strains that did not produce capsules in milk did not produce them in any other growth medium. Specific sugars required for capsule production were strain-dependent. Increasing lactose content of Elliker broth from 0.5 to 5% or adding whey protein or casein digest produced larger capsules. Whey protein concentrate stimulated production of larger capsules than did casamino acids or casitone. Some Streptococcus thermophilus strains produced capsules when grown on galactose only. Nonropy strains of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus produced capsules on lactose, but not on glucose. A ropy strain of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus produced a constant capsule size regardless of the growth medium. The ability of some strains of Streptococcus thermophilus to use galactose in capsule production could reduce browning of mozzarella cheese during baking by removing a source of reducing sugar. Media that do not support capsule production may improve cell harvesting.
TI  - Effects of ingestion of yogurts containing Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus acidophilus on spleen and Peyer's patch lymphocyte populations in the mouse.
AB  - Certain probiotic lactic acid bacteria have been reported to improve immune system function. Here, the effects of ingesting yogurts on lymphocyte populations in the spleens and Peyer's patches were determined in mice. Three probiotic-supplemented yogurts containing Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Bifidobacterium, and Lactobacillus acidophilus and one conventional yogurt containing only S. thermophilus and L. bulgaricus were prepared from commercial starter cultures and used in the study. B6C3F1 female mice were fed the four different types of yogurts mixed with an AIN-93G diet in a 50:50 (wt/wt) ratio. Nonfat dry milk mixed at a 50:50 (wt/wt) ratio with AIN-93G diet was used as the control. After a 14-day feeding period, spleen and Peyer's patches were removed and lymphocytes subjected to phenotype analysis by flow cytometry. Ingestion of the four yogurts had no effect on percentages of CD8+ (cytotoxic T cells), B220+ (B cells), IgA+, or IgM+ cells in spleen or Peyer's patches. The percentage of CD4+ (T helper) cells was significantly increased in the spleens from one group of mice fed a yogurt containing Bifidobacterium and L. acidophilus, and a similar trend was found in the remaining two probiotic-supplemented yogurts. Effects on CD4+ populations were not observed in spleens of mice fed conventional yogurt or in the Peyer's patches of any of the four yogurt groups. In total, the results suggested that ingestion of conventional or probiotic-supplemented yogurts for 2 weeks had very little effect on lymphocyte distribution in the systemic or mucosal immune compartments.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of the exopolysaccharide produced by Streptococcus thermophilus SFi20.
AB  - This paper reports isolation, structural characterization and some physico-chemical properties in aqueous solution of the exopolysaccharide (EPS) produced by Streptococcus thermophilus strain SFi20. The yield of the purified EPS was found to be reproducible and close to the average value of 143 mg/l. The chemical structure, previously suggested, has been confirmed on the basis of NMR data. Viscometric, chiro-optical and rheological measurements have been carried out with the aim of characterizing the conformational state of the polysaccharide in aqueous solution. All the data reported indicate that the EPS does not undergo a cooperative conformational transition under the investigated experimental conditions. Furthermore, the viscosity data and the viscoelastic behaviour suggest that the polymer is rather flexible and adopts a random coil conformation in aqueous solution.
TI  - Influence of a probiotic yoghurt on the status of vitamins B(1), B(2) and B(6) in the healthy adult human.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The main reason for this study was to determine whether yoghurt  bacteria, being rich in some water-soluble vitamins, release them or utilize vitamins from their surroundings. Our study was trying to determine for the first time, if the viable bacteria of probiotic yoghurt are able to influence the parameters of the B-vitamin (B(1), B(2), B(6)) status of the healthy adult human. METHODS: The test yoghurt was commercially available probiotic yoghurt prepared with Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus acidophilus, enriched with Lactobacillus casei GG. Different chemical forms of all investigated B-vitamins were determined by HPLC methods. In order to determine the influence of the yoghurt flora, each of 12 subjects consumed four yoghurt portions 125 g each ( = 500 g) a day, containing thermally inactivated cultures during the first 2-week period and yoghurt without heat treatment during the second 2-week period. RESULTS: The heat treatment of the probiotic yoghurt caused negligible changes in vitamin contents. The plasma levels of thiamin decreased significantly (p < 0.01) after the first 2-week period and kept on decreasing during the second 2-week period. A similar trend was found in the urinary excretion. The plasma levels of the B(2)-vitamers were different. The flavin adenine dinucleotide concentrations increased significantly (p < 0.01) after the consumption of heat-treated yoghurt and decreased significantly (p < 0.05) after the following 2 weeks, in which the subjects received the untreated yoghurt. In contrast, the flavin mononucleotide plasma levels decreased during the first 2-week period and increased during the second part of the study, but the change was not statistically significant. The free riboflavin concentrations in plasma and urine showed a continuous but not significant increase. The concentrations of pyridoxal-5-phosphate in plasma increased after the consumption of yoghurt with the inactivated bacteria and decreased in the second part of the study. However, the differences were not significant. The excretion of thiamin, B(2)- and B(6)-vitamers in the faeces did not significantly change throughout the study period (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our observations show that the bacterial flora of the examined yoghurt does not influence the vitamin B(1), B(2) and B(6) status of man. It seems likely that even lactobacilli of the 'probiotic' type which are vitamin B consumers can decrease the bioavailability of these vitamins for man. Obviously a thermal death of the cells did not induce a release of physiologically active vitamins.
TI  - Analysis of the genetic switch and replication region of a P335-type bacteriophage with an obligate lytic lifestyle on Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - The DNA sequence of the replication module, part of the lysis module, and remnants of a lysogenic module from the lytic P335 species lactococcal bacteriophage phi31 was determined, and its regulatory elements were investigated. The identification of a characteristic genetic switch including two divergent promoters and two cognate repressor genes strongly indicates that phi31 was derived from a temperate bacteriophage. Regulation of the two early promoters was analyzed by primer extension and transcriptional promoter fusions to a lacLM reporter. The regulatory behavior of the promoter region differed significantly from the genetic responses of temperate Lactococcus lactis phages. The cro gene homologue regulates its own production and is an efficient repressor of cI gene expression. No detectable cI gene expression could be measured in the presence of cro. cI gene expression in the absence of cro exerted minor influences on the regulation of the two promoters within the genetic switch. Homology comparisons revealed a replication module which is most likely expressed from the promoter located upstream of the cro gene homologue. The replication module encoded genes with strong homology to helicases and primases found in several Streptococcus thermophilus phages. Downstream of the primase homologue, an AT-rich noncoding origin region was identified. The characteristics and location of this region and its ability to reduce the efficiency of plaquing of phi31 10(6)-fold when present at high copy number in trans provide evidence for identification of the phage origin of replication. Phage phi31 is an obligately lytic phage that was isolated from commercial dairy fermentation environments. Neither a phage attachment site nor an integrase gene, required to establish lysogeny, was identified, explaining its lytic lifestyle and suggesting its origin from a temperate phage ancestor. Several regions showing extensive DNA and protein homologies to different temperate phages of Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, and Streptococcus were also discovered, indicating the likely exchange of DNA cassettes through horizontal gene transfer in the dynamic ecological environment of dairy fermentations.
TI  - Isolation, characterization, and influence of native, nonstarter lactic acid bacteria on Cheddar cheese quality.
AB  - To determine whether adventitious nonstarter lactic acid bacteria (NSLAB) might affect cheese flavor and quality, we studied a population of NSLAB present in 30 premium quality Cheddar cheeses (3-mo ripened) produced at a commercial facility in the United States. DNA fingerprinting analysis with a sensitive strategy for arbitrary priming polymerase chain reaction showed that 75 isolates corresponded to at least 18 distinct nonstarter organisms. According to ribotype database comparisons of representatives from the 18 groups, 9 matched Lactobacillus (closest to paracasei species), 8 matched Streptococcus thermophilus, and 1 matched to a Lactococcus species. This finding indicated that among the 75 NSLAB isolates, Lactobacillus made up 64%, S. thermophilus 32%, and Lactococcus 4%. Isolates representing 11 NSLAB groups were characterized for protease, peptidase, and diacetyl production. Based on this phenotypic analysis, two Lactobacillus isolates were evaluated as adjuncts in Cheddar cheese. All of the NSLAB identified from the adjunct cheese at 3 mo by DNA fingerprinting consisted of the adjunct lactobacilli, showing that the adjunct strains predominated throughout the early stages of ripening. The impact of adjunct lactobacilli was evident after 6 mo when free amino acids significantly increased and sensory scores improved in adjunct cheese as compared with a control cheese. The largest impact was found in adjunct cheese containing a blend of both lactobacilli strains. These results show that certain adventitious NSLAB positively contribute to flavor development.
TI  - Characterization by molecular cloning and sequencing of the gene encoding an aminopeptidase from Listeria monocytogenes.
AB  - The pepC gene of Listeria monocytogenes encodes aminopeptidase C that is predicted to share 72% amino acid sequence similarity and 53% sequence identity with the cysteine aminopeptidase PepC from Lactococcus lactis. The gene product also shows strong similarity to aminopeptidase C from Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus helveticus, and to a cysteine proteinase/bleomycin hydrolase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The enzyme from L. monocytogenes displayed broad N-terminal hydrolytic activity, with a similar substrate specificity to its lactic acid bacterial counterpart. The inhibition spectrum shows a great deal of similarity with enzymes from the family of lactic acid bacteria. In addition, one of the clones studied contained DNA sequences that could encode a regulatory protein of the deoR helix-turn-helix DNA binding protein family. The organization of the locus, designated pep, is presented along with the characterization of the gene products of the pep locus.
TI  - Gut mucosal immunostimulation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The beneficial properties of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) on human health have been frequently demonstrated. The interaction of LAB with the lymphoid cells associated to the gut to activate the mucosal immune system and the mechanisms by which they can exert an adjuvant effect is still unclear, as well as if this property is common for all the LAB. We studied the influence of the oral administration of different geneous of LAB such as Lactobacillus casei, L. acidophilus, L. rhamnosus, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, L. plantarum, Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus. We determined if the LAB assayed were able to stimulate the specific, the non-specific immune response (inflammatory response), or both. We demonstrated that all the bacteria assayed were able to increase the number of IgA producing cells associated to the lamina propria of small intestine. This effect was dose dependent. The increase in IgA+ producing cells was not always correlated with an increase in the CD4+ T cell number, indicating that some LAB assayed only induced clonal expansion of B cells triggered to produce IgA. Most of them, induced an increase in the number of cells involved in the inflammatory immune response. CD8+ T cell were diminished or not affected, with exception of L. plantarum that induced an increase at low dose. This fact would mean that LAB are unable to induce cytotoxicity mechanisms. We demonstrated the importance in the selection of LAB to be used as gut mucosal adjuvant. The different behaviours observed among them on the gut mucosal immune response, specially those that induce inflammatory immune response, show that not all the LAB can be used as oral adjuvant and that the beneficial effect of them can not generalized to genous or specie. The immunoadjuvant capacity would be a property of the strain assayed.
TI  - Genetic loci of Streptococcus mitis that mediate binding to human platelets.
AB  - The direct binding of bacteria to platelets is a postulated major interaction in  the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis. To identify bacterial components that mediate platelet binding by Streptococcus mitis, we screened a Tn916deltaE-derived mutant library of S. mitis strain SF100 for reduced binding to human platelets in vitro. Two distinct loci were found to affect platelet binding. The first contains a gene (pblT) encoding a highly hydrophobic, 43-kDa protein with 12 potential membrane-spanning segments. This protein resembles members of the major facilitator superfamily of small-molecule transporters. The second platelet binding locus consists of an apparent polycistronic operon. This region includes genes that are highly similar to those of Lactococcus lactis phage r1t and Streptococcus thermophilus phage 01205. Two genes (pblA and pblB) encoding large surface proteins are also present. The former encodes a 107-kDa protein containing tryptophan-rich repeats, which may serve to anchor the protein within the cell wall. The latter encodes a 121-kDa protein most similar to a tail fiber protein from phage 01205. Functional mapping by insertion-duplication mutagenesis and gene complementation indicates that PblB may be a platelet adhesin and that expression of PblB may be linked to that of PblA. The combined data indicate that at least two genomic regions contribute to platelet binding by S. mitis. One encodes a probable transmembrane transporter, while the second encodes two large surface proteins resembling structural components of lysogenic phages.
TI  - Analysis of six prophages in Lactococcus lactis IL1403: different genetic structure of temperate and virulent phage populations.
AB  - We report the genetic organisation of six prophages present in the genome of Lactococcus lactis IL1403. The three larger prophages (36-42 kb), belong to the already described P335 group of temperate phages, whereas the three smaller ones (13-15 kb) are most probably satellites relying on helper phage(s) for multiplication. These data give a new insight into the genetic structure of lactococcal phage populations. P335 temperate phages have variable genomes, sharing homology over only 10-33% of their length. In contrast, virulent phages have highly similar genomes sharing homology over >90% of their length. Further analysis of genetic structure in all known groups of phages active on other bacterial hosts such as Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, MYCOBACTERIUM: and Streptococcus thermophilus confirmed the existence of two types of genetic structure related to the phage way of life. This might reflect different intensities of horizontal DNA exchange: low among purely virulent phages and high among temperate phages and their lytic homologues. We suggest that the constraints on genetic exchange among purely virulent phages reflect their optimal genetic organisation, adapted to a more specialised and extreme form of parasitism than temperate/lytic phages.
TI  - Activation of silent gal genes in the lac-gal regulon of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus strain CNRZ 302 is unable to ferment galactose, neither that generated intracellularly by lactose hydrolysis nor the free sugar. Nevertheless, sequence analysis and complementation studies with Escherichia coli demonstrated that strain CNRZ 302 contained structurally intact genes for the Leloir pathway enzymes. These were organized into an operon in the order galKTE, which was preceded by a divergently transcribed regulator gene, galR, and followed by a galM gene and the lactose operon lacSZ. Results of Northern blot analysis showed that the structural gal genes were transcribed weakly, and only in medium containing lactose, by strain CNRZ 302. However, in a spontaneous galactose-fermenting mutant, designated NZ302G, the galKTE genes were well expressed in cells grown on lactose or galactose. In both CNRZ 302 and the Gal(+) mutant NZ302G, the transcription of the galR gene was induced by growth on lactose. Disruption of galR indicated that it functioned as a transcriptional activator of both the gal and lac operons while negatively regulating its own expression. Sequence analysis of the gal promoter regions of NZ302G and nine other independently isolated Gal(+) mutants of CNRZ 302 revealed mutations at three positions in the galK promoter region, which included substitutions at positions -9 and -15 as well as a single-base-pair insertion at position -37 with respect to the main transcription initiation point. Galactokinase activity measurements and analysis of gusA reporter gene fusions in strains containing the mutated promoters suggested that they were gal promoter-up mutations. We propose that poor expression of the gal genes in the galactose-negative S. thermophilus CNRZ 302 is caused by naturally occurring mutations in the galK promoter.
TI  - Protective role of probiotics and prebiotics in colon cancer.
AB  - Ingestion of viable probiotics or prebiotics is associated with anticarcinogenic  effects, one mechanism of which is the detoxification of genotoxins in the gut. This mechanism was shown experimentally in animals with use of the rat colon carcinogen 1,2-dimethylhydrazine and by determining endpoints that range from tumorigenesis to induction of DNA damage. Because of the complexity of cancer initiation, cancer progression, and the exposure of cancer in the gut, many types of interactions may be envisaged. Notably, some of our newer studies showed that short-lived metabolite mixtures isolated from milk that was fermented with strains of Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus are more effective in deactivating etiologic risk factors of colon carcinogenesis than are cellular components of microorganisms. Ingestion of prebiotics results in a different spectrum of fermentation products, including the production of high concentrations of short-chain fatty acids. Gut flora, especially after the ingestion of resistant starch, induces the chemopreventive enzyme glutathione transferase pi in the colon of the rat. Together, these factors lead to a reduced load of genotoxic agents in the gut and to an increased production of agents that deactivate toxic components. Butyrate is one such protective agent and is associated with lowering cancer risk. It was recently shown that buytrate may inhibit the genotoxic activity of nitrosamides and hydrogen peroxide in human colon cells. In humans, the ingestion of probiotics leads to the excretion of urine with low concentrations of components that are genotoxic in human colon cells and high concentrations of components that induce oxidized DNA bases.
TI  - Characterization of the cryptic plasmid pSBO2 isolated from Streptococcus bovis JB1 and construction of a new shuttle vector.
AB  - A cryptic plasmid designated pSBO2 (3582 bp) was isolated from Streptococcus bovis JB1. The pSBO2 contained putative sites for a double-strand origin (dso), a small transcriptional repressor protein (Cop), countertranscribed RNAs (ctRNAs), and a replication protein (Rep), which were similar to those from pMV158 and pLS1, which were isolated from S. agalactiae, and pWVO1, isolated from Lactococcus lactis. The putative single-strand origin (sso) of pSBO2 was similar to pER341 and pST1, which were isolated from S. thermophilus. Recombinant plasmid designated pSBE2 was constructed to bind pECM184 vector and the DNA fragment containing sso, dso, Cop, ctRNAs, and Rep of pSBO2. When pSBE2 was introduced into S. bovis 12-U-1 and no8, the plasmids in the transformants had deleted the 160-bp fragment between sso and dso. This plasmid, designated pSBE2A, was capable of transforming Escherichia coli and S. bovis strains 12-U-1 and no8 on high frequency; therefore, pSBE2A is an effective shuttle vector.
TI  - Production and monomer composition of exopolysaccharides by yogurt starter cultures.
AB  - As components of starter cultures for Bulgarian yogurt, Streptococcus salivarius  subsp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus revealed extensive exopolysaccharide (EPS) production activity when cultivated in whole cow's milk. The polymer-forming activity of thermophilic streptococci was lower (230-270 mg EPS/L) than that of the lactobacilli (400-540 mg EPS/L). Mixed cultures stimulated EPS production in yogurt manufacture, and a maximum concentration of 720-860 mg EPS/L was recorded after full coagulation of milk. The monomer structure of the exopolysaccharides formed by the yogurt starter cultures principally consists of galactose and glucose (1:1), with small amounts of xylose, arabinose, and/or mannose.
TI  - Molecular properties of Streptococcus thermophilus plasmid pER35 encoding a restriction modification system.
AB  - Bacteriophage attack on lactic fermentation bacteria (LFB) is costly to the dairy industry because it results in product loss. One mechanism used by LFB to protect themselves from bacteriophage attack is restriction of foreign DNA. Three plasmids, pER16, pER35, and pER36, from three different strains of the thermotolerant dairy fermentation bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus were sequenced. One of these plasmids, pER35, isolated from S. thermophilus ST135, encoded a type IC restriction-modification (R-M) system very similar to those encoded on plasmids pIL2614 in Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and pND861 in Lactococcus lactis biovar diacetylactis. The high degree of identity between the R-M systems encoded on pER35, pIL2614, and pND861 indicated the potential for horizontal transfer of these genes between different species of lactic fermentation bacteria. Similar to the functional R-M system encoded on pIL2614 that protects the mesophilic L. lactis subsp. lactis against phage attack, the R-M system on pER35 most likely functions in the same role in S. thermophilus ST135. The plasmid pER16 was found to encode the specificity subunit of the R-M system, but not the R or M subunits. In addition, all three plasmids encoded proteins that are present on other S. thermophilus plasmids, including a protein for rolling-circle replication (RepA) and a low-molecular-weight stress protein (Hsp). The presence of a complete R-M system encoded on a plasmid in S. thermophilus, a species that often lacks plasmids, is novel and may be beneficial for protecting S. thermophilus from bacteriophage attack under dairy fermentation conditions.
TI  - Identification of interacting mixed cultures of lactic acid bacteria by their exclusion from a model predicting the acidifying activity of non-interacting mixed cultures.
AB  - A model predicting the acidifying activity of mixed cultures of lactic acid bacteria and based on the lack of interaction between the strains has been investigated to identify interacting cultures. Three mixed cultures with Streptococcus thermophilus TH3 and ST7 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus LB10 were grown on milk. The acidifying activities of the two mixed cultures TH3/LB10 and TH3/ST7 were predicted accurately by the model, with mean prediction errors of 7.7% and 14.1%, respectively. However, the model underestimated the acidifying activity of the mixed culture ST7/LB10, with a mean prediction error of 43.5%, which provides evidence of positive interaction between the strains ST7 and LB10 during acidification.
TI  - Characterization of phage receptors in Streptococcus thermophilus using purified  cell walls obtained by a simple protocol.
AB  - A simple protocol was designed and applied to obtain Streptococcus thermophilus purified cell walls. To identify the structures involved in phage adsorption, the cell walls of two Strep. thermophilus strains were treated with sodium dodecyl sulphate and proteinase K. These treatments did not reduce the adsorption of phages CYM and 0BJ to the cell walls of Strep. thermophilus YSD10 and Strep. thermophilus BJ15, respectively. However, phage binding was reduced when the cell envelopes were treated with mutanolysin or trichloroacetic acid 5%, suggesting that the phage receptor component is part of the peptidoglycan or a polymer closely linked to it. The ability of several saccharides to inactivate both phages was also assayed. These phage inhibition experiments suggested that the phage CYM adsorbed to a component involving glucosamine and rhamnose, while glucosamine and ribose interfered with the adsorption of phage 0BJ.
TI  - Quaternary structure of the lactose transport protein of streptococcus thermophilus in the detergent-solubilized and membrane-reconstituted state
AB  
TI  - Efficient insertional mutagenesis in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Bacteria have always been considered ideal organisms for genetic analysis. While  this is true for some model organisms, like Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and, more recently, Lactococcus lactis, genetic analysis of other organisms is often prevented by lack of valuable tools, like vectors, transposons and methods for transformation, gene inactivation and random insertional mutagenesis. This is the case of the moderately thermophilic bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus, an organism that, in spite of its widespread use for food fermentations, is only poorly characterized. We report here an insertional mutagenesis system that allows efficient random mutagenesis, easy characterization of the interrupted genes and construction of stable null mutations. This may become a powerful S. thermophilus tool for both genetic analysis and construction of 'food-grade' mutants of this biotechnologically relevant microorganism.
TI  - Chronic consumption of fresh but not heated yogurt improves breath-hydrogen status and short-chain fatty acid profiles: a controlled study in healthy men with or without lactose maldigestion.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ingestion of fermented dairy products induces changes in the equilibrium and metabolism of the intestinal microflora and may thus have beneficial effects on the host. OBJECTIVE: We compared the effects of chronic consumption of yogurt with (fresh) or without (heated) live bacterial cultures (Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus) on plasma glucose, insulin, triacylglycerols, cholesterol, fatty acids, and short-chain fatty acids. DESIGN: Two groups of 12 healthy men with or without lactose malabsorption were selected with use of a breath-hydrogen test after a 30-g lactose load. Subjects were randomly assigned in a crossover design to 500 g/d of either fresh or heated yogurt for 2 periods of 15 d each, separated by a 15-d washout interval. RESULTS: Chronic consumption of fresh or heated yogurt had no detrimental effects on plasma glucose, insulin, or fatty acid areas under the curve in response to acute ingestion of 500 g yogurt in healthy men with or without lactose malabsorption. There were also no detectable changes in fasting plasma glucose, insulin, fatty acid, triacylglycerol, or cholesterol concentrations. In contrast, plasma butyrate was higher (P: < 0.03) and plasma propionate tended to be higher (P: = 0.059) in subjects without lactose malabsorption after fresh yogurt consumption than after heated yogurt consumption. There were no significant changes in plasma acetate. In subjects with lactose malabsorption, 15 d of fresh yogurt consumption also increased propionate production compared with values at baseline (P: < 0.04). In the same group, the production of breath hydrogen was lower after fresh yogurt consumption than after heated yogurt consumption (P: < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In men with lactose malabsorption, chronic consumption of yogurt containing live bacterial cultures ameliorated the malabsorption, as evidenced by lower breath-hydrogen excretion, but increased propionate concentrations. In subjects without lactose malabsorption, such yogurt tended to increase propionate and increased butyrate.
TI  - Hydrolysis of sequenced beta-casein peptides provides new insight into peptidase  activity from thermophilic lactic acid bacteria and highlights intrinsic resistance of phosphopeptides.
AB  - The peptidases of thermophilic lactic acid bacteria have a key role in the proteolysis of Swiss cheeses during warm room ripening. To compare their peptidase activities toward a dairy substrate, a tryptic/chymotryptic hydrolysate of purified beta-casein was used. Thirty-four peptides from 3 to 35 amino acids, including three phosphorylated peptides, constitute the beta-casein hydrolysate, as shown by tandem mass spectrometry. Cell extracts prepared from Lactobacillus helveticus ITG LH1, ITG LH77, and CNRZ 32, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis ITG LL14 and ITG LL51, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CNRZ 397 and NCDO 1489, and Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ 385, CIP 102303, and TA 060 were standardized in protein. The peptidase activities were assessed with the beta-casein hydrolysate as the substrate at pH 5.5 and 24 degrees C (conditions of warm room ripening) by (i) free amino acid release, (ii) reverse-phase chromatography, and (iii) identification of undigested peptides by mass spectrometry. Regardless of strain, L. helveticus was the most efficient in hydrolyzing beta-casein peptides. Interestingly, cell extracts of S. thermophilus were not able to release a significant level of free proline from the beta-casein hydrolysate, which was consistent with the identification of numerous dipeptides containing proline. With the three lactic acid bacteria tested, the phosphorylated peptides remained undigested or weakly hydrolyzed indicating their high intrinsic resistance to peptidase activities. Finally, several sets of peptides differing by a single amino acid in a C-terminal position revealed the presence of at least one carboxypeptidase in the cell extracts of these species.
TI  - Physiological study of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strains in a novel chemically defined medium.
AB  - We developed a chemically defined medium called milieu proche du lait (MPL), in which 22 Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (L. bulgaricus) strains exhibited growth rates ranging from 0.55 to 1 h(-1). MPL can also be used for cultivation of other lactobacilli and Streptococcus thermophilus. The growth characteristics of L. bulgaricus in MPL containing different carbon sources were determined, including an initial characterization of the phosphotransferase system transporters involved. For the 22 tested strains, growth on lactose was faster than on glucose, mannose, and fructose. Lactose concentrations below 0.4% were limiting for growth. We isolated 2-deoxyglucose-resistant mutants from strains CNRZ397 and ATCC 11842. CNRZ397-derived mutants were all deficient for glucose, fructose, and mannose utilization, indicating that these three sugars are probably transported via a unique mannose-specific-enzyme-II-like transporter. In contrast, mutants of ATCC 11842 exhibited diverse phenotypes, suggesting that multiple transporters may exist in that strain. We also developed a protein labeling method and verified that exopolysaccharide production and phage infection can occur in MPL. The MPL medium should thus be useful in conducting physiological studies of L. bulgaricus and other lactic acid bacteria under well controlled nutritional conditions.
TI  - Branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis is essential for optimal growth of Streptococcus thermophilus in milk.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria are nutritionally demanding bacteria which need, among other things, amino acids for optimal growth. We identified the branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) biosynthesis pathway as an essential pathway for optimal growth of Streptococcus thermophilus in milk. Through random insertional mutagenesis, we isolated and characterized two mutants for which growth in milk is affected as a consequence of ilvB and ilvC gene interruptions. This situation demonstrates that the BCAA biosynthesis pathway is active in S. thermophilus. BCAA biosynthesis is necessary but not sufficient for optimal growth of S. thermophilus and is subject to retro-inhibition processes. The specificity of the BCAA biosynthesis pathway in S. thermophilus lies in the independent transcription of the ilvC gene encoding a keto acid reductoisomerase acting on acetolactate at the junction of the BCAA and acetoin biosynthesis pathways. The possible advantages for S. thermophilus of keeping this biosynthesis pathway active could be linked either to adaptation of the organism to milk, which is different than that of other dairy bacteria, or to the role of the pathway in maintaining the internal pH.
TI  - The complete cps gene cluster from Streptococcus thermophilus NCFB 2393 involved  in the biosynthesis of a new exopolysaccharide.
AB  - The cpsFGHIJKL genes from the cps cluster of Streptococcus thermophilus NCFB 2393 involved in the biosynthesis of EPS were identified, cloned and nucleotide sequenced. The complete cps cluster is contained on an approximately 11.2 kb chromosomal region which contains 12 ORFs, including the previously cloned cpsABCDE genes. Functions were assigned to some of the predicted gene products on the basis of homology to known sequences as follows: cpsK encodes a protein thought to be involved in the polymerization and export of the polysaccharide; cpsE, cpsF, cpsG, cpsH, cpsI and cpsJ encode putative sugar transferases. Two insertion sequences, IS1193 and ISS1, were identified within and flanking the 3' end of the cps cluster respectively. Analysis of the expression of the cpsE gene in Escherichia coli demonstrated that it encodes a glucose-1-phosphate transferase; the enzyme which catalyses the first step in EPS biosynthesis in S. thermophilus NCFB 2393.
TI  - Streptococcus thermophilus cell wall-anchored proteinase: release, purification,  and biochemical and genetic characterization.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ 385 expresses a cell envelope proteinase (PrtS),  which is characterized in the present work, both at the biochemical and genetic levels. Since PrtS is resistant to most classical methods of extraction from the cell envelopes, we developed a three-step process based on loosening of the cell wall by cultivation of the cells in the presence of glycine (20 mM), mechanical disruption (with alumina powder), and enzymatic treatment (lysozyme). The pure enzyme is a serine proteinase highly activated by Ca(2+) ions. Its activity was optimal at 37 degrees C and pH 7.5 with acetyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-paranitroanilide as substrate. The study of the hydrolysis of the chromogenic and casein substrates indicated that PrtS presented an intermediate specificity between the most divergent types of cell envelope proteinases from lactococci, known as the PI and PIII types. This result was confirmed by the sequence determination of the regions involved in substrate specificity, which were a mix between those of PI and PIII types, and also had unique residues. Sequence analysis of the PrtS encoding gene revealed that PrtS is a member of the subtilase family. It is a multidomain protein which is maturated and tightly anchored to the cell wall via a mechanism involving an LPXTG motif. PrtS bears similarities to cell envelope proteinases from pyogenic streptococci (C5a peptidase and cell surface proteinase) and lactic acid bacteria (PrtP, PrtH, and PrtB). The highest homologies were found with streptococcal proteinases which lack, as PrtS, one domain (the B domain) present in cell envelope proteinases from all other lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - DNA fingerprinting of thermophilic lactic acid bacteria using repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - DNA fingerprints of lactic acid bacteria were generated by polymerase chain reaction using a primer based on the repetitive elements found in the genome of Streptococcus pneumoniae (BOX-PCR). The method made it possible to identify 37 isolates from raw milk. industrial starters and yogurt. Differentiation at species, subspecies and strain level was possible for Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, Lb. delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus and Str. thermophilus. BOX-PCR was also applied to studying the strain composition of a starter culture and the direct detection of strains in commercial fermented milk.
TI  - Biodegradability of food-associated extracellular polysaccharides.
AB  - Exopolysaccharides (EPSs) produced by lactic acid bacteria, which are common in fermented foods, are claimed to have various beneficial physiological effects on humans. Although the biodegradability of EPSs is important in relation to the bioactive properties, knowledge on this topic is limited. Therefore, the biodegradability of eight EPSs, six of which were produced by lactic acid bacteria, was compared with microorganisms from human feces or soil. EPS-degradation was determined from the decrease in polysaccharide-sugar concentration and by high-performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC). Xanthan, clavan, and the EPSs produced by Streptococcus thermophilus SFi 39 and SFi 12 were readily degraded, in contrast to the EPSs produced by Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris B40, Lactobacillus sakei 0-1, S. thermophilus SFi20, and Lactobacillus helveticus Lh59. Clearly, the susceptibility of exopolysaccharides to biological breakdown can differ greatly, implying that the physiological effects of these compounds may also vary a lot.
TI  - Control of lactose transport, beta-galactosidase activity, and glycolysis by CcpA in Streptococcus thermophilus: evidence for carbon catabolite repression by a non-phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system sugar.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus, unlike many other gram-positive bacteria, prefers lactose over glucose as the primary carbon and energy source. Moreover, lactose is not taken up by a phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS) but by the dedicated transporter LacS. In this paper we show that CcpA plays a crucial role in the fine-tuning of lactose transport, beta-galactosidase (LacZ) activity, and glycolysis to yield optimal glycolytic flux and growth rate. A catabolite-responsive element (cre) was identified in the promoter of the lacSZ operon, indicating a possible role for regulation by CcpA. Transcriptional analysis showed a sevenfold relief of repression in the absence of a functional CcpA when cells were grown on lactose. This CcpA-mediated repression of lacSZ transcription did not occur in wild-type cells during growth on galactose, taken up by the same LacS transport system. Lactose transport during fermentation was increased significantly in strains carrying a disrupted ccpA gene. Moreover, a ccpA disruption strain was found to release substantial amounts of glucose into the medium when grown on lactose. Transcriptional analysis of the ldh gene showed that expression was induced twofold during growth on lactose compared to glucose or galactose, in a CcpA-dependent manner. A reduced rate of glycolysis concomitant with an increased lactose transport rate could explain the observed expulsion of glucose in a ccpA disruption mutant. We propose that CcpA in S. thermophilus acts as a catabolic regulator during growth on the preferred non-PTS sugar lactose. In contrast to other bacteria, S. thermophilus possesses an overcapacity for lactose uptake that is repressed by CcpA to match the rate-limiting glycolytic flux.
TI  - Purification, characterisation, cloning and sequencing of the gene encoding oligopeptidase PepO from Streptococcus thermophilus A.
AB  - The oligopeptidase PepO from Streptococcus thermophilus A was purified to protein homogeneity by a five-step chromatography procedure. It was estimated to be a serine metallopeptidase of 70 kDa, with maximal activity at pH 6.5 and 41 degrees C. PepO has endopeptidase activity on oligopeptides composed of between five and 30 amino acids. PepO was demonstrated to be active and stable at the pH, temperature and salt concentrations found in Swiss-type cheese during ripening. Using a battery of PCR techniques, the pepO gene was amplified, subcloned and sequenced, revealing an open reading frame of 1893 nucleotides. The amino acid sequence analysis of the pepO gene-translation product shows homology with PepO enzymes from other lactic acid bacteria and contains the signature sequence of the metallopeptidase family.
TI  - Influence of capsular and ropy exopolysaccharide-producing Streptococcus thermophilus on Mozzarella cheese and cheese whey.
AB  - We investigated the effect of capsular and ropy exopolysaccharide-producing Streptococcus thermophilus starter bacteria on Mozzarella cheese functionality and whey viscosity. Mozzarella cheeses were manufactured with Lactobacillus helveticus LH100 paired with one of four S. thermophilus strains: MR-1C, a bacterium that produces a capsular exopolysaccharide; MTC360, a strain that secretes a ropy exopolysaccharide; TAO61, a nonexopolysaccharide-producing commercial cheese starter; and DM10, a nonencapsulated, exopolysaccharide-negative mutant of strain MR-1C. As expected, cheese moisture levels were significantly higher in Mozzarella cheeses made with exopolysaccharide-positive versus exopolysaccharide-negative streptococci, and melt properties were better in the higher moisture cheeses. Whey viscosity measurements showed that unconcentrated and ultrafiltered, fivefold concentrated whey from cheeses made with S. thermophilus MTC360 were significantly more viscous than whey from cheeses made with MR-1C, TAO61, or DM10. No significant differences were noted between the viscosity of unconcentrated or concentrated whey from cheeses made with S. thermophilus MR-1C versus the industrial cheese starter TAO61. These data indicate that encapsulated, but not ropy, exopolysaccharide-producing S. thermophilus strains can be utilized to increase the moisture level of cheese and to improve the melt properties of Mozzarella cheese without adversely affecting whey viscosity.
TI  - Viability of probiotic (Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei) and nonprobiotic microflora in Argentinian Fresco cheese.
AB  - We evaluated the suitability of Argentinian Fresco cheese as a food carrier of probiotic cultures. We used cultures of Bifidobacterium bifidum (two strains), Bifidobacterium longum (two strains), Bifidobacterium sp. (one strain), Lactobacillus acidophilus (two strains), and Lactobacillus casei (two strains) in different combinations, as probiotic adjuncts. Probiotic, lactic starter (Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus), and contaminant (coliforms, yeasts, and molds) organisms were counted at 0, 30, and 60 d of refrigerated storage. Furthermore, the acid resistance of probiotic and starter bacteria was determined from hydrochloric solutions (pH 2 and 3) of Fresco cheese. The results showed that nine different combinations of bifidobacteria and L. acidophilus had a satisfactory viability (count decreases in 60 d <1 log order) in the cheese. Both combinations of bifidobacteria and L. casei cultures assayed also showed a satisfactory survival (counts decreased <1 log order for bifidobacteria but no decrease was detected for L. casei). On the other hand, the three combinations of bifidobacteria, L. acidophilus, and L. casei tested adapted well to the Fresco cheese environment. When a cheese homogenate at pH 3 was used to partially simulate the acidic conditions in the stomach, the probiotic cultures had an excellent ability to remain viable up to 3 h. At pH 2, the cell viability was more affected; B. bifidum was the most resistant organism. This study showed that the Argentinian Fresco cheese could be used as an adequate carrier of probiotic bacteria.
TI  - Comparative genomics of the late gene cluster from Lactobacillus phages.
AB  - Three prophage sequences were identified in the Lactobacillus johnsoni strain NCC533. Prophage Lj965 predicted a gene map very similar to those of pac-site Streptococcus thermophilus phages over its DNA packaging and head and tail morphogenesis modules. Sequence similarity linked the putative DNA packaging and head morphogenesis genes at the protein level. Prophage Lj965/S. thermophilus phage Sfi11/Lactococcus lactis phage TP901-1 on one hand and Lactobacillus delbrueckii phage LL-H/Lactobacillus plantarum phage phig1e/Listeria monocytogenes phage A118 on the other hand defined two sublines of structural gene clusters in pac-site Siphoviridae from low-GC Gram-positive bacteria. Bacillus subtilis phage SPP1 linked both sublines. The putative major head and tail proteins from Lj965 shared weak sequence similarity with phages from Gram-negative bacteria. A clearly independent line of structural genes in Siphoviridae from low-GC Gram-positive bacteria is defined by temperate cos-site phages including Lactobacillus gasseri phage adh, which also shared sequence similarity with phage D3 infecting a Gram-negative bacterium. A phylogenetic tree analysis demonstrated that the ClpP-like protein identified in four cos-site Siphoviridae from Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Streptococcus, and Pseudomonas showed graded sequence relationships. The tree suggested that the ClpP-like proteins from the phages were not acquired by horizontal gene transfer from their corresponding bacterial hosts.
TI  - Broad-range bacteriophage resistance in Streptococcus thermophilus by insertional mutagenesis.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus is a lactic acid bacterium used in industrial milk fermentation. To obtain phage-resistant starters, S. thermophilus strain Sfi1 was submitted to mutagenesis with the thermolabile insertional vector pG(+)host9:ISS1 followed by a challenge with the lytic S. thermophilus phage Sfi19. Vector insertions into four distinct sites led to a phage-resistance phenotype. Three mutants were characterized further. They were protected against the homologous challenging phage and 14 heterologous phages. All three mutants adsorbed phages. No intracellular phage DNA synthesis was observed in mutants R7 and R71, while mutant R24 showed a delayed and diminished phage DNA synthesis compared to the parental Sfi1 strain. In mutant R7 a short deletion occurred next to the insertion site which removed the upstream sequences and the 15 initial codons from orf 394, encoding a likely transmembrane protein. Analogy with other phage systems suggests an involvement of this protein in the phage DNA injection process. In mutant R24 the vector was inserted into orf 269 predicting an oxido-reductase. When the vector sequence was removed via homologous recombination across the duplicated insertion elements, mutant R24 returned to the phage susceptibility of the parental strain. This observation suggested that inactivation of orf 269 was not crucial for the resistance phenotype. A gene encoding a likely restriction subunit of a type I restriction-modification system was located directly downstream of the insertion site in mutant R24. hsdM and hsdS genes encoding the modification and specificity subunits of a type I R-M system and biological evidence for an active R-M system were detected in strain Sfi1, suggesting involvement of a type I R-M system in the resistance phenotype of R24.
TI  - Effect of spray drying temperature of yoghurt on the survival of starter cultures, moisture content and sensoric properties of yoghurt powder.
AB  - A synergistic set of the strains Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 151  and Streptococcus thermophilus MK-10 was preserved with the method of spray drying. Studies were performed on the effect of outlet air temperature in range of 60-80 degrees C upon the survival of yoghurt cultures, as well as the moisture content and sensoric properties of yoghurt powder. Survival of yoghurt cultures was the highest at 60 and 65 degrees C, but excessive moisture (10.2%) of yoghurt powder had a negative effect on its texture. Moisture content of the powder was low at 80 degrees C (4.4%), unfortunately sensoric faults appeared at this temperature, and survival of bacteria cultures decreased considerably. Temperatures within the range 70-75 degrees C ensured satisfactory survival of yoghurt cultures (L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus--13.7-15.8%; S. thermophilus--51.6-54.7%), maintained proportion of the strains (L:S--1:3), satisfactory moisutre content (5.1-6.3%), and good sensoric properties of yoghurt powder.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence, expression and transcriptional analysis of the Bifidobacterium longum MB 219 lacZ gene.
AB  - The gene encoding beta-galactosidase was isolated by functional complementation of Escherichia coli from Bifidobacterium longum MB219, which exhibited the highest activity among ten Bifidobacterium strains tested of the species B. longum, B. breve, B. adolescentis, B. indicum, B. animalis and B. cuniculi. The nucleotide sequence of the 5.0-kb fragment conferring the positive beta-galactosidase phenotype to E. coli revealed the presence of a lacZ-type gene encoding a 1023-amino-acid protein that was preceded by a ribosome binding site. A sequence showing 72% identity with the proline tRNA of Bacillus subtilis and a gene probably encoding the DNA-3-methyladenine glycosydase I were located downstream from the lacZ gene, after a gap of 30-50 unsequenced base pairs. By primer-extension analysis, the transcription start site of the lacZ gene was mapped 65 nt upstream from the start codon, and it enabled identification of the -10 region of the putative promoter. The nucleotide sequence of lacZ and its deduced amino acid sequence were compared with those of beta-galactosidase genes and enzymes from other microorganisms. High similarity was demonstrated between the B. longum beta-galactosidase and its counterparts in Lactobacillus delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, E. coli, Clostridium acetobutylicum, Leuconostoc lactis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, all belonging to the LacZ family. The B. longum MB219 lacZ gene was cloned in Bifidobacterium and its expression was observed in strains with otherwise low levels of endogenous activity. The expression increased by factors of 1.5-50 and enabled those strains that do not grow on lactose to use this sugar as sole carbon source.
TI  - Effect of Streptococcus thermophilus on the trp-P-1 level in the blood.
AB  - We examined the 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-Pyrido-[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1) concentration in the blood after administering Trp-P-1 (0.25 mg/ml) with or without Streptococcus thermophilus 1131 cells (10 mg/ml) to rats. The Trp-P-1 concentration in the blood from the portal vein was significantly lower in the rats that had been administered with Trp-P-1 with the strain 1131 cells than without them. However, there was no difference in the Trp-P-1 concentration in the blood taken from the abdominal aorta of these rats.
TI  - Effect of probiotic bacteria on prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice prostheses in vitro.
AB  - The proliferation of yeasts in the mixed bacterial and fungal biofilms colonising silicone rubber voice prostheses in laryngectomised patients is the main cause of malfunctioning of the valve mechanism on the oesophageal side of the prostheses. Indwelling voice prostheses usually have to be replaced every 3-4 months. The consumption of probiotic bacteria is largely motivated by health claims related to the urogenital and lower digestive tract, but not to the upper digestive tract. The present study examined the influence of probiotic bacteria on the prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice prostheses, as formed in a modified Robbins device. Exposure of oropharyngeal biofilms on voice prostheses to suspensions of Bifidobacterium infantis 420 or Enterococcus faecium 603 did not significantly reduce the number of yeasts in the biofilm. However, suspensions of Lactobacillus fermentum B54, L. rhamnosus 744 or L. lactis cremoris SK11 led to a reduction in the number of yeasts harvested from the voice prostheses. Suspensions of L. casei Shirota and Streptococcus thermophilus B significantly reduced the number of yeasts in the biofilm to 39% and 33%, respectively. The reduction brought about in yeast prevalence in the mixed biofilm was greatest by exposure to a suspension of L. lactis 53, with yeast prevalence only 4% of the control. In conclusion, the study demonstrated that the prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice prostheses might be controlled by consumption of probiotic bacteria.
TI  - Behavior of enterotoxigenic strains of Staphylococcus aureus in milk fermented with a yogurt starter culture.
AB  - The ability of a yogurt starter culture formed by Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus to inhibit the growth of four enterotoxin type A and B producers Staphylococcus aureus strains (ATCC 6538, S6, FRI-100 and a strain isolated from milk) during fermentation of milk and subsequent storage was investigated. Sterile skim milk was inoculated with about 10(6) CFU/ml of S. aureus and with about 10(6) CFU of starter culture, and incubated at 42 degrees C during 8 h, followed by refrigeration at 4 degrees C. Samples were taken every 2 h during fermentation and every 2 days during storage. Viable count of lactic acid bacteria and S. aureus as well as pH, acidity, thermostable deoxyribonuclease (TNase) and staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) production were evaluated. Behavior of four strains was similar; S. aureus survived the 8 h fermentation with LAB, and its population began to decrease from the first day of storage, being completely inhibited at 9-10 days. TNase and SEA production were positive in all samples taken along the study. It was demonstrated that enterotoxigenic strains of S. aureus were able to survive the fermentation of milk with a yogurt starter culture and they were inhibited after several days during storage of the fermented product, contrary to the general belief which considered it very difficult due to the low pH. Even though S. aureus was inhibited, TNase and SEA were demonstrable along the storage. Therefore, fermented milks may play an important role in the transmission of this organism.
TI  - Oral bacteriotherapy as maintenance treatment in patients with chronic pouchitis: a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Pouchitis is the major long-term complication after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis. Most patients have relapsing disease, and no maintenance treatment study has been performed. We evaluated the efficacy of a probiotic preparation (VSL#3) containing 5 x 10(11) per gram of viable lyophilized bacteria of 4 strains of lactobacilli, 3 strains of bifidobacteria, and 1 strain of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus compared with placebo in maintenance of remission of chronic pouchitis. METHODS: Forty patients in clinical and endoscopic remission were randomized to receive either VSL#3, 6 g/day, or an identical placebo for 9 months. Patients were assessed clinically every month and endoscopically and histologically every 2 months or in the case of a relapse. Fecal samples were collected for stool culture before and after antibiotic treatment and each month during maintenance treatment. RESULTS: Three patients (15%) in the VSL#3 group had relapses within the 9-month follow-up period, compared with 20 (100%) in the placebo group (P < 0.001). Fecal concentration of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, and S. thermophilus increased significantly from baseline levels only in the VSL#3-treated group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that oral administration of this new probiotic preparation is effective in preventing flare-ups of chronic pouchitis.
TI  - Correlation of activities of the enzymes alpha-phosphoglucomutase, UDP-galactose  4-epimerase, and UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase with exopolysaccharide biosynthesis by Streptococcus thermophilus LY03.
AB  - The effects of different carbohydrates or mixtures of carbohydrates as substrates on bacterial growth and exopolysaccharide (EPS) production were studied for the yoghurt starter culture Streptococcus thermophilus LY03. This strain produces two heteropolysaccharides with the same monomeric composition (galactose and glucose in the ratio 4:1) but with different molecular masses. Lactose and glucose were fermented by S. thermophilus LY03 only when they were used as sole energy and carbohydrate sources. Fructose was also fermented when it was applied in combination with lactose or glucose. Both the amount of EPS produced and the carbohydrate source consumption rates were clearly influenced by the type of energy and carbohydrate source used, while the EPS monomeric composition remained constant (galactose-glucose, 4:1) under all circumstances. A combination of lactose and glucose resulted in the largest amounts of EPS. Measurements of the activities of enzymes involved in EPS biosynthesis, and of those involved in sugar nucleotide biosynthesis and the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway, demonstrated that the levels of activity of alpha-phosphoglucomutase, UDP-galactose 4-epimerase, and UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase are highly correlated with the amount of EPS produced. Furthermore, a weaker relationship or no relationship between the amounts of EPS and the enzymes involved in either the rhamnose nucleotide synthetic branch of the EPS biosynthesis or the pathway leading to glycolysis was observed for S. thermophilus LY03.
TI  - Quaternary structure of the lactose transport protein of Streptococcus thermophilus in the detergent-solubilized and membrane-reconstituted state.
AB  - The quaternary structure of LacS, the lactose transporter of Streptococcus thermophilus, has been determined for the detergent-solubilized and the membrane-reconstituted state of the protein. The quaternary structure of the n-dodecyl-beta-d-maltoside-solubilized state was studied using a combination of sedimentation velocity and equilibrium centrifugation analysis. From these measurements it followed that the detergent-solubilized LacS undergoes reversible self-association with a monomer to dimer mode of association. The association constants were 5.4 +/- 3.6 and 4.4 +/- 1.0 ml mg(-1) as determined from the velocity and equilibrium sedimentation measurements, respectively. The experiments did not indicate significant changes in the shape of the protein-detergent complex or the amount of detergent bound in going from the monomeric to dimeric state of LacS. Importantly, a single Cys mutant of LacS is labeled by 2-(4'-maleimidylanilino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid in a substrate-dependent manner, indicating that the detergent-solubilized protein exhibits ligand binding activity. The quaternary structure of membrane-reconstituted LacS was determined by freeze-fracture electron microscopy analysis. Recent developments in the analysis of freeze-fracture images (Eskandari, S. P., Wright, E. M., Freman, M., Starace, D. M., and Zampighi, G. A. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 95, 11235-11240) allowed us to directly correlate the cross-sectional area of the transmembrane segment to a dimeric state of the functionally membrane-reconstituted LacS protein. The cross-sectional area of the LacS protein was calibrated using the membrane-reconstituted transmembrane domain of the mannitol transporter enzyme II, an intramembrane particle for which the cross-sectional area was obtained from maps of two-dimensional crystals. The consequences of the determined quaternary structure for the transport function and regulation of LacS are discussed.
TI  - Rotational mobility and orientational stability of a transport protein in lipid membranes.
AB  - A single-cysteine mutant of the lactose transport protein LacS(C320A/W399C) from  Streptococcus thermophilus was selectively labeled with a nitroxide spin label, and its mobility in lipid membranes was studied as a function of its concentration in the membrane by saturation-transfer electron spin resonance. Bovine rhodopsin was also selectively spin-labeled and studied to aid the interpretation of the measurements. Observations of spin-labeled proteins in macroscopically aligned bilayers indicated that the spin label tends to orient so as to reflect the transmembrane orientation of the protein. Rotational correlation times of 1-2 micros for purified spin-labeled bovine rhodopsin in lipid membranes led to viscosities of 2.2 poise for bilayers of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (28 degrees C) and 3.0 poise for the specific mixture of lipids used to reconstitute LacS (30 degrees C). The rotational correlation time for LacS did not vary significantly over the range of low concentrations in lipid bilayers, where optimal activity was seen to decrease sharply and was determined to be 9 +/- 1 micros (mean +/- SD) for these samples. This mobility was interpreted as being too low for a monomer but could correspond to a dimer if the protein self-associates into an elongated configuration within the membrane. Rather than changing its oligomeric state, LacS appeared to become less ordered at the concentrations in aligned membranes exceeding 1:100 (w/w) with respect to the lipid.
TI  - Comparison of low-molecular-weight heat stress proteins encoded on plasmids in different strains of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus is used extensively for industrial fermentation of dairy products. Some strains of S. thermophilus are known to carry plasmids, and many of these plasmids are suspected of encoding low-molecular-weight heat stress proteins (Hsps) that may aid in survival under stressful conditions. In order to confirm the presence and examine the similarity of these low-molecular-weight Hsps, genes were identified and sequenced encoding Hsps on plasmids pER16 (4.5 kb), pER35 (10 kb), and pER36 (3.7 kb) from three different strains of S. thermophilus. The plasmid replication proteins were also sequenced to examine their relatedness. Amino acid sequence comparisons of the Hsps and of the replication proteins revealed a high degree of identity suggesting a common origin. Heat stress proteins enhance the viability of bacteria in extreme environments, and the presence of an Hsp encoded on a plasmid may enhance survival of S. thermophilus under harsh production conditions.
TI  - Behavior of Listeria monocytogenes in pasteurized milk during fermentation with lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The behavior of Listeria monocytogenes in pasteurized milk during fermentation with starter and nonstarter lactic acid bacteria was investigated. Pasteurized milk was co-inoculated with approximately 10(4) CFU/ml of L. monocytogenes and 10(6) CFU/ml of Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus cremoris, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, or Streptococcus thermophilus. Inoculated milks were incubated at 30 degrees C or 37 degrees C for 24 to 72 h. Listeria monocytogenes survived and also grew to some extent during incubation in the presence of all starter cultures; however, inhibition ranged from 83 to 100% based on maximum cell populations. During incubation with L. bulgaricus and L. plantarum, L. monocytogenes was completely inactivated after 20 h and 64 h of incubation at 37 degrees C and 30 degrees C, respectively. The pH of the fermenting milks declined steadily throughout the fermentation periods and was approximately 4.2 at the conclusion of the experimental period regardless both of the starter culture and pathogen combination or the temperature of incubation.
TI  - Effect of carbon dioxide under high pressure on the survival of cheese starter cultures.
AB  - A new processing method that rapidly forms curds and whey from milk has the potential to improve cheesemaking procedures if cheese starter cultures can tolerate the processing conditions. The survival of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, or Streptococcus thermophilus through this new process was evaluated. Inoculated milk containing 0, 1, or 3.25% fat or Lactobacillus MRS broth or tryptone yeast lactose broth (depending on microorganism used) was sparged with CO2 to a pressure of 5.52 MPa and held for 5 min at 38 degrees C. Broth contained 7.93 to 8.78 log CFU/ ml before processing and 7.84 to 8.66 log CFU/ml afterward. Before processing, milk inoculated with L bulgaricus, L. lactis, or S. thermophilus contained 6.81, 7.35, or 6.75 log CFU/ml, respectively. After processing, the curds contained 5.68, 7.32, or 6.50 log CFU/g, and the whey had 5.05, 6.43, or 6.14 log CFU/ml, respectively. After processing, the pHs of control samples were lower by 0.41 units in broth, 0.53 units in whey, and 0.89 units in curd. The pH of the processed inoculated samples decreased by 0.3 to 0.53 units in broth, 0.32 to 0.37 units in whey, and 0.93 to 0.98 units in the curd. Storing curds containing L. lactis at 30 degrees C or control curds and curds with L. bulgaricus or S. thermophilus at 37 degrees C for an additional 48 h resulted in pHs of 5.22, 5.41, 4.53, or 4.99, respectively. This study showed that milk inoculated with cheese starter cultures and treated with CO2 under high pressure to precipitate casein-produced curds that contained sufficient numbers of viable starter culture to produce lactic acid, thereby decreasing the pH.
TI  - HPr(His approximately P)-mediated phosphorylation differently affects counterflow and proton motive force-driven uptake via the lactose transport protein of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The lactose transport protein (LacS) of Streptococcus thermophilus has a C-terminal hydrophilic domain that is homologous to IIA protein and protein domains of the phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS). The IIA domain of LacS is phosphorylated on His-552 by the general energy coupling proteins of the PTS, which are Enzyme I and HPr. To study the effect of phosphorylation on transport, the LacS protein was purified and incorporated into liposomes with the IIA domain facing outwards. This allowed the phosphorylation of the membrane-reconstituted protein by purified HPr(His approximately P) of S. thermophilus. Phosphorylation of LacS increased the V(max) of counterflow transport, whereas the V(max) of the proton motive force (delta p)-driven lactose uptake was not affected. In line with a range of kinetic studies, we propose that phosphorylation affects the rate constants for the reorientation of the ternary complex (LacS with bound lactose plus proton), which is rate-determining for counterflow but not for delta p-driven transport.
TI  - Phosphorylation state of HPr determines the level of expression and the extent of phosphorylation of the lactose transport protein of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The lactose transport protein (LacS) of Streptococcus thermophilus is composed of a translocator domain and a regulatory domain that is phosphorylated by HPr(His approximately P), the general energy coupling protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS). Lactose transport is affected by the phosphorylation state of HPr through changes in the activity of the LacS protein as well as expression of the lacS gene. To address whether or not CcpA-HPr(Ser-P)-mediated catabolite control is involved, the levels of LacS were determined under conditions in which the cellular phosphorylation state of HPr greatly differed. It appears that HPr(Ser-P) is mainly present in the exponential phase of growth, whereas HPr(His approximately P) dominates in the stationary phase. The transition from HPr(Ser-P) to HPr(His approximately P) parallels an increase in LacS level, a drop in lactose and an increase in galactose concentration in the growth medium. Because the K(m)(out) for lactose is higher than that for galactose, the lactose transport capacity decreases as lactose concentration decreases and galactose accumulates in the medium. Our data indicate that S. thermophilus compensates for the diminished transport capacity by synthesizing more LacS and phosphorylating the protein, which results in increased transport activity. The link between transport capacity and lacS expression levels and LacS phosphorylation are discussed.
TI  - Autolysis and related proteolysis in Swiss cheese for two Lactobacillus helveticus strains.
AB  - Intracellular peptidases of Lactobacillus helveticus may play a major role in the proteolysis of Swiss cheeses, provided that they are released through bacterial lysis. Experimental Swiss cheeses were manufactured on a small scale from thermized and microfiltered milk using as starters (in addition to Streptococcus thermophilus and Propionibacterium freudenreichii) one of two Lb. helveticus strains, ITGLH1 and ITGLH77, which undergo lysis to different extents in vitro. All the cheeses were biochemically identical after pressing. The viability of Lb. helveticus ITGLH1 and ITGLH77 decreased to a similar extent (96-98%) while in the cold room, but the concomitant release of intracellular lactate dehydrogenase in cheeses made with strain ITGLH1 was 5-7-fold that in cheeses made with ITGLH77. Protein profiles and immunoblot detection of the dipeptidase PepD confirmed a greater degree of lysis of the ITGLH1 strain. Free active peptidases were detected in aqueous extracts of cheese for both strains, and proteolysis occurred principally in the warm room. Reversed-phase HPLC revealed a more extensive peptide hydrolysis for ITGLH1, which was confirmed by the greater release of free NH2 groups (+33%) and free amino acids (+75%) compared with ITGLH77. As the intracellular peptidase activities of ITGLH1 and ITGLH77 have previously been shown to be similar, our results indicated that the extent of lysis of Lb. helveticus could have a direct impact on the degree of proteolysis in Swiss cheeses.
TI  - Dynamic changes of intracellular pH in individual lactic acid bacterium cells in  response to a rapid drop in extracellular pH.
AB  - We describe the dynamics of changes in the intracellular pH (pH(i)) values of a number of lactic acid bacteria in response to a rapid drop in the extracellular pH (pH(ex)). Strains of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Lactococcus lactis were investigated. Listeria innocua, a gram-positive, non-lactic acid bacterium, was included for comparison. The method which we used was based on fluorescence ratio imaging of single cells, and it was therefore possible to describe variations in pH(i) within a population. The bacteria were immobilized on a membrane filter, placed in a closed perfusion chamber, and analyzed during a rapid decrease in the pH(ex) from 7.0 to 5.0. Under these conditions, the pH(i) of L. innocua remained neutral (between 7 and 8). In contrast, the pH(i) values of all of the strains of lactic acid bacteria investigated decreased to approximately 5.5 as the pH(ex) was decreased. No pronounced differences were observed between cells of the same strain harvested from the exponential and stationary phases. Small differences between species were observed with regard to the initial pH(i) at pH(ex) 7.0, while different kinetics of pH(i) regulation were observed in different species and also in different strains of S. thermophilus.
TI  - Mur1, a Streptococcus thermophilus peptidoglycan hydrolase devoid of a specific cell wall binding domain.
AB  - The gene encoding Mur1, a Streptococcus thermophilus peptidoglycan hydrolase, was cloned by homology with acmA, the Lactococcus lactis major autolysin gene. Mur1 is a 24.7-kDa protein endowed with a putative signal peptide. Sequence analysis evidenced that Mur1 encompasses exactly the AcmA region containing the catalytic domain, but lacks the one containing amino acid repeats involved in cell wall binding. Mur1 appears to be expressed and cell-associated in S. thermophilus, as revealed by immunoblot analysis. These results suggest that the cell wall attachment mode of Mur1 differs from that of most peptidoglycan hydrolases described so far.
TI  - Effects of a muramidase on a mixed bacterial community.
AB  - In bacterial communities one bacterium can influence the growth of other members  of the population. These interactions may be based on nutritional factors or may occur via bacterial signaling molecules that are released in the medium. We present an example, showing that in addition to the above means of interactions, muramidases, enzymes that specifically cleave peptidoglycan chains, can also mediate interactions between bacteria. Using fluorescent in situ hybridization we demonstrate that Lactococcus lactis muramidase AcmA can hydrolyze the cell wall of Streptococcus thermophilus, without affecting viability. This intercellular activity of the lactococcal muramidase results in chain disruption of streptococci in vivo. Our data lead us to propose that chains can give growth advantages to streptococci in aerobic conditions.
TI  - Use of chemical mutagenesis for the isolation of food grade beta-galactosidase overproducing mutants of bifidobacteria, lactobacilli and Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - A classical chemical mutagenesis protocol was evaluated for increasing beta-galactosidase production by probiotic bacteria to improve their potential to treat symptoms of lactose malabsorption in humans. Two Bifidobacterium species (B. breve and B. longum) and one strain each of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus were tested by a single exposure to two chemical mutagens, ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). To screen for beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) overproducing mutants, optimized EMS and MNNG mutant pots for each strain were plated on BHI agar containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (X-gal). Colonies that exhibited a blue color were selected for quantitative beta-gal activities using the o-nitrophenyl-beta-galactoside (ONPG) assay. Seventy-five mutants were obtained out of more than 2 million colonies screened and showed increased beta-galactosidase activities compared with the wild-type strains. EMS gave a higher frequency of beta-gal overproducing mutants than MNNG for three of the four strains, S. thermophilus, B. breve, and B. longum, whereas the frequency of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus beta-gal mutants was similar with both mutagens. The highest beta-gal increases, when induced during growth in lactose, for mutants of each culture were 137% for L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus; 104% for S. thermophilus; 70% for B. breve; and 222% for B. longum mutants. This food-grade classical approach has the ability to moderately increase beta-gal concentrations in probiotic cultures to improve their potential for treating the symptoms of lactose malabsorption in humans.
TI  - Origin of acetaldehyde during milk fermentation using (13)C-labeled precursors.
AB  - Acetaldehyde formation by Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus during fermentation of cow's milk was investigated using (13)C-labeled glucose, L-threonine, and pyruvate with a recent static-and-trapped-headspace technique that does not require derivatization of acetaldehyde prior to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Over 90% and almost 100% of acetaldehyde originated from glucose during fermentation by L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus, respectively, taking into account both singly and doubly labeled acetaldehyde. As both microorganisms showed threonine aldolase activity and formed labeled acetaldehyde from (13)C-labeled threonine during the fermentation of milk, this amino acid should also contribute to the acetaldehyde produced.
TI  - Close approximation of putative alpha -helices II, IV, VII, X, and XI in the translocation pathway of the lactose transport protein of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The lactose transport protein (LacS) of Streptococcus thermophilus belongs to a family of transporters in which putative alpha-helices II and IV have been implicated in cation binding and the coupled transport of the substrate and the cation. Here, the analysis of site-directed mutants shows that a positive and negative charge at positions 64 and 71 in helix II are essential for transport, but not for lactose binding. The conservation of charge/side-chain properties is less critical for Glu-67 and Ile-70 in helix II, and Asp-133 and Lys-139 in helix IV, but these residues are important for the coupled transport of lactose together with a proton. The analysis of second-site suppressor mutants indicates an ion pair exists between helices II and IV, and thus a close approximation of these helices can be made. The second-site suppressor analysis also suggests ion pairing between helix II and the intracellular loops 6-7 and 10-11. Because the C-terminal region of the transmembrane domain, especially helix XI and loop 10-11, is important for substrate binding in this family of proteins, we propose that sugar and proton binding and translocation are performed by the joint action of these regions in the protein. Indeed, substrate protection of maleimide labeling of single cysteine mutants confirms that alpha-helices II and IV are directly interacting or at least conformationally involved in sugar binding and/or translocation. On the basis of new and published data, we reason that the helices II, IV, VII, X, and XI and the intracellular loops 6-7 and 10-11 are in close proximity and form the binding sites and/or the translocation pathway in the transporters of the galactosides-pentosides-hexuronides family.
TI  - Identification and synthesis of a trisaccharide produced from lactose by transgalactosylation.
AB  - Enzymatic transgalactosylation of lactose by means of Streptococcus thermophilus, subspecies DN-001065, led to a mixture of D-galactose (approximately 4%), D-glucose (approximately 15%), lactose (approximately 51%), minor disaccharides (6%), trisaccharides (approximately 20%) and tetrasaccharides (3%). The major trisaccharide (approximately 16%) was identified by NMR spectroscopy and chemical synthesis as being the known beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1-->3)-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1-->4)-D-glucos e (3'-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-lactose). It was purified from a mixture of peracetylated oligosaccharides by column chromatography followed by deacetylation. For the first time, 3'-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-lactose has been obtained on the 1 g scale, by resorting to simple techniques and equipment. NMR spectra have been unambiguously assigned.
TI  - Probiotic culture survival and implications in fermented frozen yogurt characteristics.
AB  - Low-fat ice cream mix was fermented with probiotic-supplemented and traditional starter culture systems and evaluated for culture survival, composition, and sensory characteristics of frozen product. Fermentations were stopped when the titratable acidity reached 0.15% greater than the initial titratable acidity (end point 1) or when the pH reached 5.6 (end point 2). Mix was frozen and stored for 11 wk at -20 degrees C. The traditional yogurt culture system contained the strains Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus. The probiotic-supplemented system contained the traditional cultures as well as Bifidobacterium longum and Lactobacillus acidophilus. We compared recovery of Bifodobacterium by three methods, a repair-detection system with roll-tubes and plates on modified bifid glucose medium and plates with maltose + galactose reinforced clostridial medium. Culture bacteria in both systems did not decrease in the yogurt during frozen storage. The roll-tube method with modified bifid glucose agar and repair detection system provided at least one-half log10 cfu/ml higher recovery of B. longum compared with recoveries using modified bifid glucose agar or maltose + galactose reinforced clostridial agar on petri plates. No change in concentrations of lactose or protein for products fermented with either culture system occurred during storage. Acid flavor was more intense when product was fermented to pH 5.6, but yogurt flavor was not intensified. The presence of probiotic bacteria in the supplemented system seemed to cause no differences in protein and lactose concentration and sensory characteristics.
TI  - Characterization of Streptococcus thermophilus strains that undergo lysis under unfavourable environmental conditions.
AB  - The autolysis of starter lactic acid bacteria appears as a promising way to enhance the flavour of fermented dairy products. The present work was aimed at investigating the autolysis phenomenon in Streptococcus thermophilus, a thermophilic lactic acid bacteria involved in the starters used for the production of yoghurts, Italian and Swiss-type cheeses. Out of 146 strains screened for their aptitude to spontaneously lyse at the end of growth in M17 medium containing lactose in limited concentration, six strains, among which is the type strain CNRZ 1358, were found to be highly autolytic. These autolytic strains are characterized by a typical bell-shaped growth curve. Lysis of the type strain, which was studied as the model, was triggered under unfavourable environmental conditions, such as lactose depletion and NaCl or organic solvents addition. The lysogenic character of this strain was evidenced. Taken together, our results indicate that the autolytic phenotype in S. thermophilus is linked to the lysogenic character but does not result from the massive prophage induction under stressing conditions.
TI  - Thermal and chemical inactivation of indigenous Streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophages isolated from Argentinian dairy plants.
AB  - Thermal and chemical resistance of five autochthonal bacteriophages of Streptococcus thermophilus, isolated from Cuartirolo cheese wheys and yogurt, was investigated. Times to obtain 99% inactivation of phages (T99) at 63 degrees C and 72 degrees C in three suspension media (enriched tryptic soy broth, reconstituted commercial nonfat skim milk, and tris magnesium gelatin buffer) were determined. The thermal resistance was dependent on the phages studied but not detectable counts (<10 PFU/ml) were only achieved by heating at 90 degrees C during 5 min. The data obtained for the three assayed media did not permit verifying significant differences among them. Sodium hypochlorite (100 ppm) provided a fast inactivation of bacteriophage particles (<10 PFU/ml after 5 min). Ethanol, at concentrations of 75% and 100%, was also effective for phage destruction. Isopropanol was slightly less effective than ethanol at the same concentrations. Peracetic acid (0.15%) was also a very effective agent for phage inactivation. The results showed that these autochthonal bacteriophages were not completely inactivated neither by normal pasteurization treatments nor by some biocides commonly used in disinfection, except sodium hypochlorite and peracetic acid. The practical implications of these findings have pointed out the necessity of recognizing the importance of establishing adequate conditions to assure effective thermal and chemical treatments in dairy plants and laboratory environments.
TI  - Reference map of soluble proteins from Streptococcus thermophilus by two-dimensional electrophoresis.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus is a lactic acid bacterium widely used for the production of fermented dairy products. The two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) protein profile was obtained from three independent analyses of 2-DE gels of soluble proteins of the strain PB18. About 270 spots were detected by silver staining and the average molecular weight and isoelectric point of each protein spot were calculated to be 41 600 and 5.2, respectively. Twelve proteins were purified by chromatographic techniques because their concentration was too low for direct sequencing from blots. Eleven were located in the PB18 2-DE profile after silver staining. These preliminary results contribute to the setting up of a two-dimensional image (or reference map) of the proteins from S. thermophilus in order to identify and compare strains of various origin or to follow metabolic process such as stress. Bidimensional autoradiographs of two strains (PB18 and ST105) of S. thermophilus grown in exponential phase at 42 degrees C with [35S]methionine were compared with an image analysis system. Among the eleven located proteins in the 2-DE silver-stained profile, nine were found in PB18 and eight in ST105 autoradiographs. One protein was specific to PB18. The eight proteins could play the role of internal 2-D PAGE markers of p/ and Mr for S. thermophilus.
TI  - Technological properties of milks fermented with thermophilic lactic acid bacteria at suboptimal temperature.
AB  - In the present work the synergistic relationship between different strains of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus was studied at optimal (44 degrees C) and suboptimal temperatures (30 degrees C). Acidification, viscosity, whey syneresis, and bacterial concentration of the final product were evaluated on single-strain and mixed cultures after 24 h at 30 degrees C and 6 h at 44 degrees C. Three pairs of strains (LBB + CP2, LBP + CP2, and LBR + CP2) showed synergistic effect, which was reflected by the viscosity and syneresis of the coagulum. These results were more significant when cultures were incubated at 30 degrees C, reaching apparent viscosity values of 19 to 28 mPa x s. On the other hand, lactobacilli cultures enhanced the growth of two streptococci strains (CP2 and CP4). These results were confirmed by cultures of streptococci supplemented with supernatants of culture of lactobacilli. Those supernatants stimulate the viscosity produced by CP2 and CP4 strains and reduce the syneresis of all cultures of streptococci. Neither the increase of viscosity nor reduction of syneresis could be attributed to a decrease of pH.
TI  - Effect of 8 week intake of probiotic milk products on risk factors for cardiovascular diseases.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of a probiotic milk product containing the culture CAUSIDO(R) and of two alternative products on risk factors for cardiovascular disease in overweight and obese subjects. DESIGN: An 8 week randomized, double-blind, placebo- and compliance-controlled, parallel study. SUBJECTS: Seventy healthy, weight-stable, overweight and obese (25.0<BMI<37.5 kg/m2) males (n=20) and females (n=50), 18-55 y old, were randomly assigned into five groups. INTERVENTION: Four groups consumed 450 ml fermented milk products (yoghurt) daily. Group 1: a yoghurt fermented with two strains of Streptococcus thermophilus and two strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus (StLa). Group 2: a placebo yoghurt fermented with delta-acid-lactone (PY). Group 3: a yoghurt fermented with two strains of Streptococcus thermophilus and one strain of Lactobacillus rhamnosus (StLr). Group 4: a yoghurt fermented with one strain of Enterococcus faecium and two strains of Streptococcus thermophilus (CAUSIDO(R) culture), GAIO(R) (G). The dietary composition of the yoghurt was otherwise similar. The fifth group was given two placebo pills (PP) daily. RESULTS: When comparing all five treatment groups, unadjusted for changes in body weight, no statistical effects were observed in week 8 in the G-group on low density lipoproteins (LDL)-cholesterol (P=0.29). After adjustment for small changes in body weight, LDL-cholesterol decreased by 8.4% (0.26+/-0.10 mmol/l; P<0.05) and fibrinogen increased (0.74+/-0.32 mmol/l; P<0.05) after 8 weeks in the G-group. This was significantly different from the group consuming chemically fermented yoghurt and the group consuming placebo pills (P<0.05). After 8 weeks, systolic blood pressure was significantly more reduced in the StLa and G-group compared to StLr. No other differences were found. CONCLUSION: The CAUSIDO(R) culture reduced LDL-cholesterol and increased fibrinogen in the overweight subjects at a 450 ml consumption daily for 8 weeks. The effect on LDL-cholesterol confirms previous studies. An immunostimulation by one of the strains in the product might explain the effect on fibrinogen in the G-group.

TI  - Characterization of a novel integrative element, ICESt1, in the lactic acid bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The 35.5-kb ICESt1 element of Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ368 is bordered by a 27-bp repeat and integrated into the 3' end of a gene encoding a putative fructose-1,6-biphosphate aldolase. This element encodes site-specific integrase and excisionase enzymes related to those of conjugative transposons Tn5276 and Tn5252. The integrase was found to be involved in a site-specific excision of a circular form. ICESt1 also encodes putative conjugative transfer proteins related to those of the conjugative transposon Tn916. Therefore, ICESt1 could be or could be derived from an integrative conjugative element.
TI  - Enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
AB  - Enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against Ent. faecalis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. sake, Listeria innocua, Propionibacterium acidipropionici, Propionibacterium sp., Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium. One of the four pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. No antimicrobial activity was recorded against Bacillus cereus, Cl. sporogenes, Cl. tyrobutyricum, Leuconostoc cremoris, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Staphylococcus carnosus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to Proteinase K, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. Treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. Half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees C for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a pH of 1.0-5.0 and pH 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. Enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 AU ml-1, but increased further to 1600 AU ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. The peptide is approximately 3.4 kDa in size, as determined after partial purification with Amberlite XAD-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The mechanism of antimicrobial activity against Lact. sake LMG 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.
TI  - The production of freeze-dried immobilized cultures of Streptococcus thermophilus and their acidification properties in milk.
AB  - The aim of this study was to prepare alginate-immobilized freeze-dried cultures of Streptococcus thermophilus and to compare the acidifying activities of these rehydrated cultures with classical free cell liquid inoculants. Streptococcus thermophilus BT1 grew in alginate beads and the population reached 10(10) cfu g(-1) after 6 h incubation. Re-inoculation of the beads in fresh medium with a further 6 h incubation did not improve the biomass level, but extending the incubation at 42 degrees C to 24 h caused significant death. The rehydrated immobilized cell technology (ICT) starter contained 13% free cells. In acidifying activity tests, the ICT culture had a similar acidification curve to that of a classical milk-grown free cell culture, except that it reached lower final pH values. Although the differences between the ICT and liquid cultures were not important, there were significant effects of inoculation level on lag time, maximum acidification rate and on the pH and time at which the acidification rate was at its highest.
TI  - [The role of the carbohydrate composition of the glycocalyx in some species of lactobacilli in the manifestation of their adhesive properties].
AB  - Availability of certain monosaccharides in the composition of glycocalyx of lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus plantarum--strains 337D and 11/16; Streptococcus thermophilus--strains S1 (nonmucous race) and S5 (mucous race), Enterococcus faecium (K-50) has been investigated with the help of plant lectins with certain carbohydrate specificity labelled by colloid gold. All the microorganisms under investigation were characterized by the presence of N-acetyl-D-galactosamine and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine in rather insignificant amounts. Glycocalyx of lactic acid bacteria was also characterized by availability of essential amount of L-fructose and low amount of sialic acid (except for S. thermophilus S5 (mucous race). Presence of alpha-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, alpha-D, beta-D-galactose, alpha-D-glucose, alpha-D-mannose in the composition of the lactic acid bacteria glycocalyx composition evidences for the additional role of these monosaccharides in the process of the microorganism adhesion on the human and animal intestine mucosa. It has been confirmed that availability of certain monosaccharides in the composition of surface glycopolymers of lactic acid bacteria was connected with adhesive properties of cells and their existence conditions.
TI  - Reduction of rotavirus infection in children receiving bifidobacteria-supplemented formula.
AB  - This study was conducted at Pakkred Babies Home, Bangkok, Thailand; with the hypothesis that children receiving probiotic-supplemented milk-based formula may be protected from developing diarrheal diseases. Salivary rotavirus-specific IgA antibody was used as an indicator of rotavirus infection. One hundred and seventy-five children, aged 6-36 months, were enrolled in the study. They were divided into 3 groups according to the type of formula given. There were 81 episodes of diarrhea during an 8-month study period, most of which were caused by bacterial enteropathogens. Ninety-seven pairs of salivary samples were adequate for the analysis of rotavirus antibody. Among 23 children receiving milk-based follow-up formula and serving as control group, 30.4 per cent of them had > or = 4-fold increase in the antibody titre, indicating subclinical rotavirus infection. The majority of children in the other 2 study groups, receiving the same formula supplemented with either Bifidobacterium Bb12 alone or together with Streptococcus thermophilus, had no significant change in the antibody titres between the two time points. The results of this study support our hypothesis that children receiving bifidobacteria-supplemented milk-based formula may be protected against symptomatic rotavirus infection.
TI  - Quantification of micro-organisms in binary mixed populations by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy.
AB  - Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was used for the first time to determine the ratios of different microorganisms in mixtures. Exemplarily, systems composed of two food-associated yeast species (Saccharomyces cerevisiae/Hanseniaspora uvarum) and two yoghurt lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus acidophilus/Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus) were investigated. Determination of the cell number ratio in the lactic acid bacteria system was possible with a minimal prediction accuracy of +/- 16 ratio percentage points while the minimum accuracy of prediction in the yeast two-component system was +/- 4% (both at a 95% confidence level). These results show that FT-IR spectroscopy is potentially a rapid method for the quantification of cell ratios in mixtures of two different microorganisms, provided that the cell ratio does not drop below a certain, system-specific threshold.
TI  - Vicinal diketone formation in yogurt: (13)C precursors and effect of branched-chain amino acids.
AB  - Addition of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) or an inhibitor of the BCAA biochemical pathways during fermentation of milk with a lac(-) mutant of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus strongly influenced the formation of two aroma-impact compounds, 2,3-butanedione and 2,3-pentanedione, as well as their direct precursors 2-acetolactate and 2-acetohydroxybutyrate. This suggests a connection between vicinal diketone formation and BCAA biosynthesis in yogurt bacteria. A recently developed static-and-trapped headspace technique combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry demonstrated incorporation of (13)C from [U-(13)C(6)]-D-glucose and [U-(13)C(4)]-L-threonine into both vicinal diketones. For 2,3-butanedione, glucose is the major precursor via pyruvate and activated acetaldehyde. For 2, 3-pentanedione, L-threonine is a precursor via 2-ketobutyrate, but glucose is the major contributor via activated acetaldehyde and, possibly, also via 2-ketobutyrate, which is a degradation product of 3-methylaspartate, an intermediate in glutamate synthesis.
TI  - Effect of administration of fermented milk containing whey protein concentrate to rats and healthy men on serum lipids and blood pressure.
AB  - The effect of fermented milk supplemented with whey protein concentrate on the serum lipid level of rats was investigated. The serum total cholesterol level for the group fed fermented milk with both Lactobacillus casei TMC0409 and Streptococcus thermophilus TMC 1543 was significantly lower than that of the control group (P<0.05) in rats. Furthermore, the effect of the longterm intake of this fermented milk on the serum lipid level of twenty healthy adult men was investigated. During the 8-wk study, the volunteers consumed 200 ml of fermented milk or placebo in the morning and evening. Blood samples were drawn for analysis three times, just before taking the experimental diet, and after 4 wk and 8 wk of consumption. After 8 wk, the high density lipoprotein cholesterol level for the fermented milk group showed a significant rise after 4 wk (P<0.05), whereas that of the placebo group showed no change even after 4 wk (P>0.05). The triglyceride level for the fermented milk group lowered significantly after 4 wk (<0.05), whereas that of the placebo group showed no change even after 4 wk (P>0.05). The atherogenic index [(total cholesterol - high density lipoprotein cholesterol)/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol] for the fermented milk group decreased significantly from 4.24 to 3.52 (P<0.05). The systolic blood pressure lowered significantly by the intake of fermented milk (P<0.05) On the other hand, such effect was not observed in the placebo group (P>0.05). These results indicate potential of the development of fermented milk with multiple therapeutic effects.
TI  - A probiotic strain of L. acidophilus reduces DMH-induced large intestinal tumors  in male Sprague-Dawley rats.
AB  - Probiotic bacteria strains were examined for their influence on 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-induced intestinal tumors in 100 male Sprague-Dawley rats. Lactobacillus acidophilus (Delvo Pro LA-1), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (GG), Bifidobacterium animalis (CSCC1941), and Streptococcus thermophilus (DD145) strains were examined for their influence when added as freeze-dried bacteria to an experimental diet based on a high-fat semipurified (AIN-93) rodent diet. Four bacterial treatments were compared: L. acidophilus, L. acidophilus + B. animalis, L. rhamnosus, and S. thermophilus, the bacteria being added daily at 1% freeze-dried weight (10(10) colony-forming units/g) to the diet. Trends were observed in the incidence of rats with large intestinal tumors for three treatments: 25% lower than control for L. acidophilus, 20% lower for L. acidophilus + B. animalis and L. rhamnosus treatments, and 10% lower for S. thermophilus. Large intestinal tumor burden was significantly lower for treated rats with L. acidophilus than for the control group (10 and 3 tumors/treatment group, respectively, p = 0.05). Large intestinal tumor mass index was also lower for the L. acidophilus treatment than for control (1.70 and 0.10, respectively, p < 0.05). Other treatments showed no statistically significant change from control for these indexes of tumorigenesis. For rats fed L. acidophilus, no adenocarcinomas were present in the colons. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of bacterial chromosomal DNA fragments was used to differentiate introduced (exogenous) bacterial strains from indigenous bacteria of the same genera present in the feces. Survival during gut passage and displacement of indigenous lactobacilli occurred with introduced L. acidophilus and L. rhamnosus GG during the probiotic treatment period. However, introduced strains of B. animalis and S. thermophilus were not able to be isolated from feces. It is concluded that this strain of L. acidophilus supplied as freeze-dried bacteria in the diet was protective, as seen by a small but significant inhibition of tumors within the rat colon.
TI  - The Streptococcus thermophilus autolytic phenotype results from a leaky prophage.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus autolytic strains are characterized by a typical bell-shaped growth curve when grown under appropriate conditions. The cellular mechanisms involved in the triggering of lysis and the bacteriolytic activities of these strains were investigated in this study. Lactose depletion and organic solvents (ethanol, methanol, and chloroform) were shown to trigger a premature and immediate lysis of M17 exponentially growing cells. These factors and compounds are suspected to act by altering the cell envelope properties, causing either the permeabilization (organic solvents) or the depolarization (lactose depletion) of the cytoplasmic membrane. The autolytic character was shown to be associated with lysogeny. Phage particles, most of which were defective, were observed in the culture supernatants after both mitomycin C-induced and spontaneous lysis. By renaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, a bacteriolytic activity was detected at 31 kDa exclusively in the autolytic strains. This enzyme was detected during both growth and spontaneous lysis with the same intensity. We have shown that it was prophage encoded and homologous to the endolysin Lyt51 of the streptococcal temperate bacteriophage phi01205 (M. Sheehan, E. Stanley, G. F. Fitzgerald, and D. van Sinderen, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 65:569-577, 1999). It appears from our results that the autolytic properties are conferred to the S. thermophilus strains by a leaky prophage but do not result from massive prophage induction. More specifically, we propose that phagic genes are constitutively expressed in almost all the cells at a low and nonlethal level and that lysis is controlled and achieved by the prophage-encoded lysis proteins.
TI  - Modulating immune responses with probiotic bacteria.
AB  - For many years, probiotic bacteria have been known to confer health benefits to the consumer. One possible mechanism for this may be the ability of probiotic bacteria to modulate immune responses. Oral administration of Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota (LcS) has been found to enhance innate immunity by stimulating the activity of splenic NK cells. Oral feeding with killed LcS was able to stimulate the production of Th1 cytokines, resulting in repressed production of IgE antibodies against Ovalbumin in experimental mice. The ability to switch mucosal immune responses towards Th1 with probiotic bacteria provides a strategy for treatment of allergic disorders. Growth of Meth A tumour cells in the lungs was also inhibited by intrapleural injection of LcS. Oral administration of other probiotic bacteria, such as Streptococcus thermophilus (St), Lactobacillus fermentum (Lf) and yeast (Y), elicited different immune responses. Mice that were prefed yeast or Lf followed by feeding with ovalbumin (OVA) responded better to vaccination with OVA than mice not given either probiotic or OVA or mice that had been prefed only OVA. However, antibody responses were significantly suppressed in response to vaccination with OVA in mice that had been prefed yeast followed by yeast and OVA as well as mice prefed Lf followed by Lf and OVA. Prefeeding St followed by OVA feeding enhanced cellular immune responses against ovalbumin. In contrast, mice prefed St followed by St + OVA were hyporesponsive against OVA. While antigen feeding alone appears to prime for an immune response, cofeeding antigen with probiotic bacteria can suppress both antibody and cellular immune responses and may provide an efficacious protocol to attenuate autoimmune diseases, such as experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, by jointly dosing with myelin basic protein and probiotic bacteria.
TI  - Screening of lactic acid bacteria for bile salt hydrolase activity.
AB  - Bile salt hydrolysis is an important metabolic reaction in the bile salt metabolism of mammals. This reaction has a facilitating effect for bile salt excretion but can also be involved in various illnesses. In recent years interest has increased to use bile salt hydrolysis to influence the cholesterol metabolism of humans and farm animals. To understand the distribution and range of bile salt hydrolase activity in lactic acid bacteria, we screened more than 300 strains of the genera Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus and the species Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Streptococcus thermophilus. Results obtained for 273 strains showed that bile salt hydrolase activity is common in Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus but absent in L. lactis, Leu. mesenteroides, and S. thermophilus. Nearly all bifidobacteria species and strains have bile salt hydrolase activity, whereas this activity can only be found in selected species of lactobacilli. A strong correlation can be observed between the habitat of a genus or species and the presence of bile salt hydrolase activity. Most often bile salt hydrolase activity is found in strains that have been isolated from the intestines or from feces from mammals--an environment rich in conjugated and unconjugated bile acids. Strains and species from other habitats like milk or vegetables--environments from which bile salts are absent--do normally not have bile salt hydrolase activity. In two independent assays, we established that bile salt hydrolase activity in bifidobacteria is, in general, much higher than in lactobacilli.
TI  - The effect of a probiotic milk product on plasma cholesterol: a meta-analysis of  short-term intervention studies.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Certain fermented dairy milk products may have beneficial effects on plasma cholesterol levels. However, a number of studies have produced conflicting results as to whether dietary supplementation by a probiotic dairy product containing the bacteria culture Causido(R) reduces plasma cholesterol. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a meta-analysis of intervention studies to evaluate the effect of the Causido(R) culture on plasma total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol. THE PROBIOTIC MILK PRODUCT: The yoghurt product Gaio(R) is fermented with Causido(R), composed of one strain of Enterococcus faecium (human species) with the proposed cholesterol-lowering effect, and two strains of Streptococcus thermophilus. STUDY INCLUSION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Six studies were identified from a literature search and from the yoghurt producer. All studies met the inclusion criteria. Summary data for plasma concentrations of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol were extracted from the original publications or by personal request to the authors. Data from 4-8 weeks of treatment duration was used. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: We performed a traditional meta-analysis where mean differences between intervention and control of the pre-post changes in total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol were calculated, as well as 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: In the six studies included in the meta-analysis, the Gaio(R) interventions produced changes in total cholesterol above those of the control groups ranging from -0.02 to -1.02 mmol/l and in LDL-cholesterol ranging from -0.02 to -1.15 mmol/l. After inclusion of an open-label study, the meta-analysis of the double-blind studies showed that Gaio(R) as compared to the control group changed total cholesterol by -0.22 mmol/l (95% CI: -0.35 to -0.08, P<0.01) and LDL-cholesterol by -0.20 mmol/l (95% CI: -0.33 to -0.06, P<0.005). The outcome was essentially the same if all studies were included. CONCLUSIONS: The present meta-analysis of controlled short-term intervention studies shows that the fermented yoghurt product produced a 4% decrease in total cholesterol and a 5% decrease in LDL-cholesterol when the open-label study is excluded. To demonstrate sustained effects on blood lipids, long-term studies are required. SPONSORSHIP: MD Foods A/S, Denmark.
TI  - Widespread distribution of a group I intron and its three deletion derivatives in the lysin gene of Streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophages.
AB  - Of 62 Streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophages isolated from various ecological  settings, half contain a lysin gene interrupted by a group IA2 intron. Phage mRNA splicing was demonstrated. Five phages possess a variant form of the intron resulting from three distinct deletion events located in the intron-harbored open reading frame (orf 253). The predicted orf 253 gene sequence showed a significantly lower GC content than the surrounding intron and lysin gene sequences, and the predicted protein shared a motif with endonucleases found in phages from both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. A comparison of the phage lysin genes revealed a clear division between intron-containing and intron-free alleles, leading to the establishment of a 14-bp consensus sequence associated with intron possession. The conserved intron was not found elsewhere in the phage or S. thermophilus bacterial genomes. Folding of the intron RNA revealed secondary structure elements shared with other phage introns: first, a 38-bp insertion between regions P3 and P4 that can be folded into two stem-loop structures (shared with introns from Bacillus phage SPO1 and relatives); second, a conserved P7.2 region (shared with all phage introns); third, the location of the stop codon from orf 253 in the P8 stem (shared with coliphage T4 and Bacillus phage SPO1 introns); fourth, orf 253, which has sequence similarity with the H-N-H motif of putative endonuclease genes found in introns from Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, and Bacillus phages.
TI  - Identification of four loci isolated from two Streptococcus thermophilus phage genomes responsible for mediating bacteriophage resistance.
AB  - Sequence data derived from the Streptococcus thermophilus phages phiO1205 and phi7201 indicated that each of these phages contains a distinct DNA region dedicated to replication. Southern blotting experiments showed that phages infecting S. thermophilus may be divided into at least two groups, each containing the presumptive replication functions of either &phi;O1205 (group I) or &phi;7201 (group II). Specific regions from the putative replication module of each of the two phages were examined for their ability to provide phage resistance.
TI  - Enhanced and feedback-resistant gamma-glutamyl kinase activity of an Escherichia  coli transformant carrying a mutated proB gene of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - We used a PCR-based method to generate a single base pair mutation in the proB gene of Streptococcus thermophilus, which replaced an aspartic acid with a glycine residue at position 192 of the first proline biosynthetic enzyme gamma-glutamyl kinase. This was the first identified mutation in amino acid biosynthesis in S. thermophilus to our knowledge. The mutation caused an enhanced, feedback-resistant gamma-glutamyl kinase activity and conferred an analogue-resistant phenotype to an Escherichia coli transformant containing the mutated gene.
TI  - A spectroscopic assay for the analysis of carbohydrate transport reactions.
AB  - A carbohydrate-transport assay was developed that does not require isotopically labelled substrates, but allows transport reactions to be followed spectrophotometrically. It makes use of a membrane system (hybrid membranes or proteoliposomes) bearing the transport system of interest, and a pyrroloquinoline quinone-dependent aldose dehydrogenase [soluble glucose dehydrogenase (sGDH)] and the electron acceptor 2,6-dichloroindophenol (Cl2Ind) enclosed in the vesicle lumen. After transport across the vesicular membrane, the sugar is oxidized by sGDH. The accompanying reduction of Cl2Ind results in a decrease in A600. The assay was developed and optimized for the lactose carrier (LacS) of Streptococcus thermophilus, and both solute/H+ symport and exchange types of transport could be measured with high sensitivity in crude membranes as well as in proteoliposomes. To observe exchange transport, the membranes were preloaded with a nonoxidizable substrate analogue and diluted in assay buffer containing an oxidizable sugar. Transport rates measured with this assay are comparable with those obtained with the conventional assay using isotopically labelled substrates. The method is particularly suited for determining transport reactions that are not coupled to any form of metabolic energy such as uniport reactions, or for characterizing mutant proteins with a defective energy-coupling mechanism or systems with high-affinity constants for sugars.
TI  - Proinflammatory cytokine and nitric oxide induction in murine macrophages by cell wall and cytoplasmic extracts of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Cells from a number of bacterial genera have been shown to possess mitogenic and  polyclonal activating properties when cultured with cells of the immune system. Based on previously reported health immune-enhancing effects of fermented dairy products, we tested the potentiating effects of representative lactic acid bacteria and their extracts on leukocyte function. Specifically, the effects of in vitro exposure to heat-killed cells of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. casei, L. gasseri, L. helveticus, L. reuteri, and Streptococcus thermophilus, their cell walls, and their cytoplasmic extracts on proliferation as well as cytokine and nitric oxide (NO) production were examined in the RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line. A similar strategy was applied to murine cultures composed of peritoneal, spleen, and Peyer's patch cells. Both the cell wall and cytoplasmic fractions of lactic acid bacteria were able to stimulate cloned macrophages to produce significant amounts of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, (interleukin) IL-6, and NO. Pronounced enhancement of IL-6 production by peritoneal cells was observed when cultured with those extracts, whereas, effects were not noted in spleen and Peyer's patch cell cultures from mice. Based on the results, it appears that, as a group, the lactic acid bacteria were capable of stimulating macrophages and possibly other immune cells to produce cytokines and NO, and both their cell walls and cytoplasm contributed to these capacities.
TI  - Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry for monitoring bacterial protein digestion in yogurt production
AB  - Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry was employed to determine the changes in milk protein profile due to the action of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus, the strains usually employed in yogurt production. Whereas the fermentation with the former shows the digestion of high molecular mass casein with the production of a low molecular mass peptide (3850 Da), the latter does not seem to exhibit any proteolytic activity. Proteolysis becomes relevant when milk is treated with a mixture of the two bacteria, reasonably due to symbiotic phenomena. The analysis of yogurt samples coming from industrial plants indicates increased activity of the two bacteria in the presence of ingredients containing sugars. Copyright 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
TI  - Molecular and physiological characterization of dominant bacterial populations in traditional mozzarella cheese processing
AB  - The development of the dominant bacterial populations during traditional Mozzarella cheese production was investigated using physiological analyses and molecular techniques for strain typing and taxonomic identification. Analysis of RAPD fingerprints revealed that the dominant bacterial community was composed of 25 different biotypes, and the sequence analysis of 16S rDNA demonstrated that the isolated strains belonged to Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, Leuc. lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Strep. bovis, Strep. uberis, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, L. garviae, Carnobacterium divergens, C. piscicola, Aerococcus viridans, Staphylococcus carnosus, Staph. epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Ent. sulphureus and Enterococcus spp. The bacterial populations were characterized for their physiological properties. Two strains, belonging to Strep. thermophilus and L. lactis subsp. lactis, were the most acidifying; theL. lactis subsp. lactis strain was also proteolytic and eight strains were positive to citrate fermentation. Moreover, the molecular techniques allowed the identification of potential pathogens in a non-ripened cheese produced from raw milk.
TI  - Antioxidative ability of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Nineteen strains of lactic acid bacteria were investigated for antioxidative activity. These includedLactobacillus acidophilus B, E, N1, 4356, LA-1, and Farr; Lactobacillus bulgaricus 12 278, 448, 449, Lb, 1006, and 11 842; Streptococcus thermophilus 821, MC, 573, 3641, and 19 987; and Bifidobacterium longum B6 and 15 708. Intracellular cell-free extract of all strains demonstrated antioxidative activity with inhibition rates of ascorbate autoxidation in the range of 7-12%. Antioxidative mechanisms including metal ion chelating ability, scavenge of reactive oxygen species, enzyme inhibition, and reducing activity of intracellular cell-free extract of lactic acid bacteria were studied. S. thermophilus 821 had the highest metal ion chelating ability for Fe(2+), and B. longum 15 708 showed the highest Cu(2+) chelating ability among the 19 strains tested. All strains demonstrated reactive oxygen species scavenging ability. L. acidophilus E showed the highest hydroxyl radical scavenging ability, and B. longum B6 had the best hydrogen peroxide scavenging ability. Reducing activity was also found in all strains. Most of the strains tested demonstrated excellent reducing activity. B. longum B6 showed the highest reducing activity among the 19 strains tested. In enzyme inhibition, superoxide dismutase activity was not found in these 19 strains, and the activity of superoxide dismutase was not induced when metal ion Mn(2+), Fe(2+), or Cu(2+)Zn(2+) was present.
TI  - Substrate recognition at the cytoplasmic and extracellular binding site of the lactose transport protein of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The lactose transport protein (LacS) of Streptococcus thermophilus catalyzes the  uptake of lactose in an exchange reaction with intracellularly formed galactose. The interactions between the substrate and the cytoplasmic and extracellular binding site of LacS have been characterized by assaying binding and transport of a range of sugars in proteoliposomes, in which the purified protein was reconstituted with a unidirectional orientation. Specificity for galactoside binding is given by the spatial configuration of the C-2, C-3, C-4, and C-6 hydroxyl groups of the galactose moiety. Except for a C-4 methoxy substitution, replacement of the hydroxyl groups for bulkier groups is not tolerated at these positions. Large hydrophobic or hydrophilic substitutions on the galactose C-1 alpha or beta position did not impair transport. In fact, the hydrophobic groups increased the binding affinity but decreased transport rates compared with galactose. Binding and transport characteristics of deoxygalactosides from either side of the membrane showed that the cytoplasmic and extracellular binding site interact differently with galactose. Compared with galactose, the IC(50) values for 2-deoxy- and 6-deoxygalactose at the cytoplasmic binding site were increased 150- and 20-fold, respectively, whereas they were the same at the extracellular binding site. From these and other experiments, we conclude that the binding sites and translocation pathway of LacS are spacious along the C-1 to C-4 axis of the galactose moiety and are restricted along the C-2 to C-6 axis. The differences in affinity at the cytoplasmic and extracellular binding site ensure that the transport via LacS is highly asymmetrical for the two opposing directions of translocation.
TI  - TPW22, a lactococcal temperate phage with a site-specific integrase closely related to Streptococcus thermophilus phage integrases.
AB  - The temperate phage TPW22, induced from Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris W22, and the evolutionarily interesting integrase of this phage were characterized. Phage TPW22 was propagated lytically on L. lactis subsp. cremoris 3107, which could also be lysogenized by site-specific integration. The attachment site (attP), 5'-TAAGGCGACGGTCG-3', of phage TPW22 was present on a 7.5-kb EcoRI fragment, a 3.4-kb EcoRI-HindIII fragment of which was sequenced. Sequence information revealed the presence of an integrase gene (int). The deduced amino acid sequence showed 42 and 28% identity with integrases of streptococcal and lactococcal phages, respectively. The identities with these integrase-encoding genes were 52 and 45%, respectively, at the nucleotide level. This could indicate horizontal gene transfer. A stable integration vector containing attP and int was constructed, and integration in L. lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363 was obtained. The existence of an exchangeable lactococcal phage integration module was suggested. The proposed module covers the phage attachment site, the integrase gene, and surrounding factor-independent terminator structures. The phages phiLC3, TP901-1, and TPW22 all have different versions of this module. Phylogenetically, the TPW22 Int links the phiLC3 lactococcal integrase with known Streptococcus thermophilus integrases.
TI  - The effects of some herbs on the activities of thermophilic dairy cultures.
AB  - In this study, the effects of some herbs (Allium sp., Thymus sp., Anhriscus sp. and Ferule sp.) on growth and acid production of thermophilic cultures (Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus) were determined. The herbs were sterilized with gamma radiation and added to fermentation media at concentrations of 0.5, 1, 2 and 3% (w/w). Control medium was without herb. Results showed that increasing herb concentrations stimulated acid production by Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus.
TI  - Characterization in vitro and in vivo of a new HU family protein from Streptococcus thermophilus ST11.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus is a thermophilic gram-positive bacterium belonging to the lactic acid group. We report the isolation and characterization of a new 9.6-kDa DNA-binding protein, HSth, belonging to the HU family of nucleoid-associated proteins. The hsth gene was isolated in a 2.5-kb genomic region, upstream of a gene with strong homology to Lactococcus lactis pyrD. It is transcribed from a single E. coli sigma(70)-like promoter. Based on its high level of sequence similarity to B. subtilis and E. coli HU, HSth appears to be an HU homologue. The HSth protein shows biochemical and functional properties typical of HU proteins from gram-positive bacteria, being heat-stable, acid-soluble, and homodimeric. When expressed in HU-deficient E. coli cells, HSth supported the growth of bacteriophage Mu as efficiently as E. coli HU homo- and heterodimeric proteins. It did not, however, display any IHF-specific functions. Finally, we show that HSth binds to linear DNA with no apparent specificity, forming protein-DNA complexes similar but not identical to those observed with E. coli HU proteins.
TI  - Antiproliferative effects of homogenates derived from five strains of candidate probiotic bacteria.
AB  - Unheated and heat-treated homogenates were separately prepared from candidate probiotic bacteria, including Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Bifidobacterium lactis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and Streptococcus thermophilus. We compared the phytohemagglutinin-induced proliferation of mononuclear cells in the presence of homogenates and in the presence of a control containing no homogenate by assessing thymidine incorporation in cell cultures. All homogenates suppressed proliferation, whether the enzymatic activity was inactivated or not inactivated by heating. When the proliferation assays were repeated with cytoplasmic and cell wall extracts derived from the homogenate of L. rhamnosus GG, the cytoplasmic extract but not the cell wall extract was suppressive. These findings indicate that candidate probiotic bacteria possess a heat-stable antiproliferative component(s). These bacteria may be used to generate microbiologically nonviable yet immunologically active probiotic food products that are easier to store and have a longer shelf life.
TI  - Expression of a new cold shock protein of 21.5 kDa and of the major cold shock protein by Streptococcus thermophilus after cold shock.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus is widely used in food fermentations; it commonly suffers diverse stress challenges during manufacturing. This study investigated the cold shock response of S. thermophilus when the cell culture temperature shifted from 42 degrees C to 15 degrees C or 20 degrees C. The growth of cells was affected more drastically after cold shock at 15 degrees C than at 20 degrees C. The generation time was increased by a factor of 19 when the temperature was lowered from 42 degrees to 20 degrees C, and by a factor of 72 after a cold shock at 15 degrees C. The two-dimensional electrophoretic protein patterns of S. thermophilus under cold shock conditions were compared with the reference protein pattern when cells were grown at optimal temperature. Two proteins of 21.5 and 7.5 kDa synthesized in response to cold shock were characterized. N-terminal sequencing and sequence homology searches have shown that the 7.5-kDa protein belonged to the family of the major cold shock proteins, while no homology was found for the new cold shock protein of 21.5 kDa.
TI  - Promoter activity of the pER341-borne ST(Phsp) in heterologous gene expression in Escherichia coli and Streptococcus thermophilus(1).
AB  - A 138-bp EcoO109/HinfI fragment of Streptococcus thermophilus plasmid pER341 (2798 bp) including the promoter sequence of the heat stress protein gene hsp16.4 was tested in vector constructs for ability to activate the promoterless green fluorescent protein gene (gfp) from a jelly fish in Escherichia coli, S. thermophilus, and lactococci. ST(Phsp) promoted gfp expression in transformed hosts as evidenced by the presence of green fluorescent (GFP(+)) colonies under UV illumination. The results confirmed the potential of ST(Phsp) as a functional promoter in heterologous gene expression in dairy fermentation bacteria.
TI  - Unraveling the function of glycosyltransferases in Streptococcus thermophilus Sfi6.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus Sfi6 produces a texturizing exopolysaccharide (EPS) consisting of a -->3)[alpha-D-Galp-(1-->6)]-beta-D-Glcp-(1-->3)-alpha-D-GalpNAc-(1--> 3)-beta-D-Galp-(1--> repeating unit. We previously identified and analyzed a 14.5-kb gene cluster from S. thermophilus Sfi6 consisting of 13 genes responsible for its EPS production. Within this gene cluster, we found a central region of genes (epsE, epsF, epsG, and epsI) that showed similarity to glycosyltransferases. In this study, we investigated the sugar specificity of these enzymes. EpsE catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of the EPS repeating unit. It exhibits phosphogalactosyltransferase activity and transfers galactose onto the lipophilic carrier. The second step is fulfilled by EpsG, which transfers an alpha-N-acetylgalactosamine onto the first beta-galactoside. The activity of EpsF was determined by characterizing the EPS produced by an S. thermophilus epsF deletion mutant. This EPS consisted of the monosaccharides Gal, Glc, and GalNAc in an approximately equimolar ratio, thus suggesting that epsF codes for the branching galactosyltransferase. epsI probably codes for the beta-1,3-glucosyltransferase, since it is the only glycosyltransferase to which no gene has been assigned and it exhibits similarity to other beta-glycosyltransferases. EpsE shows the conserved features of phosphoglycosyltransferases, whereas EpsF and EpsG exhibit the primary structure of alpha-glycosyltransferases, belonging to glycosyltransferase family 4, whose members are conserved in all major phylogenetic lineages, including the Archaea and Eukaryota.
TI  - Functional analysis of glycosyltransferase genes from Lactococcus lactis and other gram-positive cocci: complementation, expression, and diversity.
AB  - Sixteen exopolysaccharide (EPS)-producing Lactococcus lactis strains were analyzed for the chemical compositions of their EPSs and the locations, sequences, and organization of the eps genes involved in EPS biosynthesis. This allowed the grouping of these strains into three major groups, representatives of which were studied in detail. Previously, we have characterized the eps gene cluster of strain NIZO B40 (group I) and determined the function of three of its glycosyltransferase (GTF) genes. Fragments of the eps gene clusters of strains NIZO B35 (group II) and NIZO B891 (group III) were cloned, and these encoded the NIZO B35 priming galactosyltransferase, the NIZO B891 priming glucosyltransferase, and the NIZO B891 galactosyltransferase involved in the second step of repeating-unit synthesis. The NIZO B40 priming glucosyltransferase gene epsD was replaced with an erythromycin resistance gene, and this resulted in loss of EPS production. This epsD deletion was complemented with priming GTF genes from gram-positive organisms with known function and substrate specificity. Although no EPS production was found with priming galactosyltransferase genes from L. lactis or Streptococcus thermophilus, complementation with priming glucosyltransferase genes involved in L. lactis EPS and Streptococcus pneumoniae capsule biosynthesis could completely restore or even increase EPS production in L. lactis.
TI  - Cold shock proteins and low-temperature response of Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ302.
AB  - Low-temperature adaptation and cryoprotection were studied in the thermophilic lactic acid bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ302. S. thermophilus actively adapts to freezing during a pretreatment at 20 degrees C, resulting in an approximately 1, 000-fold increased survival after four freeze-thaw cycles compared to mid-exponential-phase cells grown at an optimal temperature of 42 degrees C. No adaptation is observed when cells are exposed to a temperature (10 degrees C) below the minimal growth temperature of the strain (just below 15 degrees C). By two-dimensional gel electrophoresis several 7-kDa cold-induced proteins were identified, which are the major induced proteins after a shift to 20 degrees C. These cold shock proteins were maximally expressed at 20 degrees C, while the induction level was low after cold shock to 10 degrees C. To confirm the presence of csp genes in S. thermophilus, a PCR strategy was used which yielded products of different sizes. Sequence analysis revealed csp-like sequences that were up to 95% identical to those of csp genes of S. thermophilus ST1-1, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Lactococcus lactis. Northern blot analysis revealed a seven- to ninefold induction of csp mRNA after a temperature shift to 20 degrees C, showing that this thermophilic bacterium indeed contains at least one cold-inducible csp gene and that its regulation takes place at the transcriptional level.
TI  - [Bioluminescent assay of total bacterial contamination of raw milk].
AB  - A rapid (30-35 min) bioluminescence assay of total bacterial contamination (TBC)  of raw milk was optimized. This method includes incubation of milk samples in the presence of Neonol-10 and medical purity grade pancreatin with further removal of nonbacterial ATP by filtration through a membrane filter, cell disruption by treatment with dimethyl sulfoxide, and measurement of ATP concentration in a reaction with the bioluminescent reagent Immolum. The TBC detection threshold is 0.5 x 10(5) colony-forming units (CFU) per ml milk. Coefficients of correlation between the standard plate count method and bioluminescence assay (R) and residual standard deviations (Sxy) in raw milk samples (n = 140) were 0.83 and 0.54, respectively. In sterilized milk samples artificially contaminated with pure cultures of the main representatives of milk microflora (coli-forms, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Streptococcus group D), these values were 0.89-0.99 and 0.09-0.29, respectively. The specific content of ATP was found to be (0.8 +/- 0.1) x 10(-18) mol/CFU in coli-forms; (12.0 +/- 8.1) x 10(-18) mol/CFU in S. aureus; (35.2 +/- 16.9) x 10(-18) mol/CFU in S. thermophilus; and (42.5 +/- 1.3) x 10(-18) in Streptococcus group D.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the pediocin operon in Streptococcus thermophilus and other lactic fermentation bacteria.
AB  - Production of pediocin in Pediococcus acidilactici is associated with pMBR1.0, which encodes prepediocin, a pediocin immunity protein, and two proteins involved in secretion and precursor processing. These four genes are organized as an operon under control of a single promoter. We have constructed shuttle vectors that contain all four structural genes, the chromosomal promoter ST(P2201) from Streptococcus thermophilus, and repA from the 2-kbp S. thermophilus plasmid pER8. The recombinant plasmid, pPC318, expressed and secreted active pediocin in Escherichia coli. Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, and Enterococcus faecalis were electrotransformed with pPC418, a modified vector fitted with an erythromycin resistance tracking gene. Pediocin was produced and secreted in each of the lactic acid bacteria, and production was stable for up to ten passages. The expression of pediocin in dairy fermentation microbes has important implications for bacteriocins as food preservatives in dairy products.
TI  - Comparative genomics of Streptococcus thermophilus phage species supports a modular evolution theory.
AB  - The comparative analysis of five completely sequenced Streptococcus thermophilus  bacteriophage genomes demonstrated that their diversification was achieved by a combination of DNA recombination events and an accumulation of point mutations. The five phages included lytic and temperate phages, both pac site and cos site, from three distinct geographical areas. The units of genetic exchange were either large, comprising the entire morphogenesis gene cluster, excluding the putative tail fiber genes, or small, consisting of one or maximally two genes or even segments of a gene. Many indels were flanked by DNA repeats. Differences in a single putative tail fiber gene correlated with the host ranges of the phages. The predicted tail fiber protein consisted of highly conserved domains containing conspicuous glycine repeats interspersed with highly variable domains. As in the T-even coliphage adhesins, the glycine-containing domains were recombinational hot spots. Downstream of a highly conserved DNA replication region, all lytic phages showed a short duplication; in three isolates the origin of replication was repeated. The lytic phages could conceivably be derived from the temperate phages by deletion and multiple rearrangement events in the lysogeny module, giving rise to occasional selfish phages that defy the superinfection control systems of the corresponding temperate phages.
TI  - Reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation product-scavenging ability of yogurt organisms.
AB  - The antioxidative activity of the intracellular extracts of yogurt organisms was  investigated. All 11 strains tested, including five strains of Streptococcus thermophilus and six strains of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, demonstrated an antioxidative effect on the inhibition of linoleic acid peroxidation. The antioxidative effect of intracellular extracts of 10(8) cells of yogurt organisms was equivalent to 25 to 96 ppm butylated hydroxytoluene, which indicated that all strains demonstrated excellent antioxidative activity. The scavenging of reactive oxygen species, hydroxyl radical, and hydrogen peroxide was studied for intracellular extracts of yogurt organisms. All strains showed reactive oxygen species-scavenging ability. Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus Lb demonstrated the highest hydroxyl radical-scavenging ability at 234 microM. Streptococcus thermophilus MC and 821 and L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 448 and 449 scavenged the most hydrogen peroxide at approximately 50 microM. The scavenging ability of lipid peroxidation products, t-butylhydroperoxide and malondialdehyde, was also evaluated. Results showed that the extracts were not able to scavenge the t-butylhydroperoxide. Nevertheless, malondialdehyde was scavenged well by most strains.
TI  - Impact on the composition of the faecal flora by a new probiotic preparation: preliminary data on maintenance treatment of patients with ulcerative colitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) oral compounds are the standard maintenance treatment for ulcerative colitis in remission, some patients cannot use them because of side-effects. Clinical and experimental observations have suggested the potential role of probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease therapy. AIM: To evaluate the effects on intestinal microflora and the clinical efficacy of a new probiotic preparation in patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with ulcerative colitis, intolerant or allergic to 5-ASA, have been treated with a new probiotic preparation (VSL#3, CSL, Milan, Italy) containing 5x10(11) cells/g of 3 strains of bifidobacteria, 4 strains of lactobacilli and 1 strain of Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. Two doses of 3 g were administered o.d. for 12 months. Faecal samples for stool culture were obtained from the patients at the beginning of the trial and after 10, 20, 40, 60, 75, 90 days, 12 months and at 15 days after the end of the treatment. The following bacterial groups have been evaluated in the faeces: total aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, enterococci, Streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, Bacteroides, clostridia, coliforms. Patients were assessed clinically every two months, and assessed endoscopically at 6 and 12 months or in relapse. RESULTS: Faecal concentrations of Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria increased significantly in all patients, compared to their basal level, from the 20th day of treatment (P<0.05) and remained stable throughout the study. Concentrations of Bacteroides, clostridia, coliforms, total aerobic and anaerobic bacteria did not change significantly during treatment (P = N.S.). Fifteen of 20 treated patients remained in remission during the study, one patient was lost to follow up, while the remaining relapsed. No significant side-effects have been reported. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that this probiotic preparation is able to colonize the intestine, and suggest that it may be useful in maintaining the remission in ulcerative colitis patients intolerant or allergic to 5-ASA. Controlled trials are warranted to confirm these preliminary results.
TI  - Characterisation of Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ1205 and its cured and re-lysogenised derivatives.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ1205 is the lysogenic host for the temperate phage phi O1205. A derivative of CNRZ1205 was isolated which was cured of phi O1205 and this strain was used to construct a re-lysogenised derivative. Pulse field gel electrophoresis and sequencing of the attachment site regions confirmed that excision and re-integration of the phage was a site-specific event. Interestingly, cells from the cured, as well as its re-lysogenised derivative, were found to have a very long chain length.
TI  - Structural information on a membrane transport protein from nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy using sequence-selective nitroxide labeling.
AB  - The lactose transport protein (LacS) from Streptococcus thermophilus bearing a single cysteine mutation, K373C, within the putative interhelix loop 10-11 has been overexpressed in native membranes. Cross-polarization magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) could selectively distinguish binding of (13)C-labeled substrate to just 50-60 nmol of LacS(K373C) in the native fluid membranes. Nitroxide electron spin-label at the K373C location was essentially immobile on the time scale of both conventional electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR) (<10(-8)s) and saturation-transfer ESR (<10(-3)s), under the same conditions as used in the NMR studies. The presence of the nitroxide spin-label effectively obscured the high-resolution NMR signal from bound substrate, even though (13)C-labeled substrate was shown to be within the binding center of the protein. The interhelix loop 10-11 is concluded to be in reasonably close proximity to the substrate binding site(s) of LacS (<15 A), and the loop region is expected to penetrate between the transmembrane segments of the protein that are involved in the translocation process.
TI  - Comparative sequence analysis of the DNA packaging, head, and tail morphogenesis  modules in the temperate cos-site Streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophage Sfi21.
AB  - The temperate Streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophage Sfi21 possesses 15-nucleotide-long cohesive ends with a 3' overhang that reconstitutes a cos-site with twofold hyphenated rotational symmetry. Over the DNA packaging, head and tail morphogenesis modules, the Sfi21 sequence predicts a gene map that is strikingly similar to that of lambdoid coliphages in the absence of any sequence similarity. A nearly one to one gene correlation was found with the phage lambda genes Nu1 to H, except for gene B-to-E complex, where the Sfi21 map resembled that of coliphage HK97. The similarity between Sfi21 and HK97 was striking: both major head proteins showed an N-terminal coiled-coil structure, the mature major head proteins started at amino acid positions 105 and 104, respectively, and both major head genes were preceded by genes encoding a possible protease and portal protein. The purported Sfi21 protease is the first viral member of the ClpP protease family. The prediction of Sfi21 gene functions by reference to the gene map of intensively investigated coliphages was experimentally confirmed for the major head and tail gene. Phage Sfi21 shows nucleotide sequence similarity with Lactococcus phage BK5-T and a lactococcal prophage and amino acid sequence similarity with the Lactobacillus phage A2 and the Staphylococcus phage PVL. PVL is a missing link that connects the portal proteins from Sfi21 and HK97 with respect to sequence similarity. These observations and database searches, which demonstrate sequence similarity between proteins of phage from gram-positive bacteria, proteobacteria, and Archaea, constrain models of phage evolution.
TI  - The genetic relationship between virulent and temperate Streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophages: whole genome comparison of cos-site phages Sfi19 and Sfi21.
AB  - The virulent cos-site Streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophage Sfi19 has a 37,392-bp-long genome consisting of 44 open reading frames all encoded on the same DNA strand. The genome of the temperate cos-site S. thermophilus phage Sfi21 is 3.3 kb longer (40,740 bp, 53 orfs). Both genomes are very similarly organized and differed mainly by gene deletion and DNA rearrangement events in the lysogeny module; gene replacement, duplication, and deletion events in the DNA replication module, and numerous point mutations. The level of point mutations varied from <1% (lysis and DNA replication modules) to >15% (DNA packaging and head morphogenesis modules). A dotplot analysis showed nearly a straight line over the left 25 kb of their genomes. Over the right genome half, a more variable dotplot pattern was observed. The entire lysogeny module from Sfi21 comprising 12 genes was replaced by 7 orfs in Sfi19, six showed similarity with genes from temperate pac-site S. thermophilus phages. None of the genes implicated in the establishment of the lysogenic state (integrase, superinfection immunity, repressor) or remnants of it were conserved in Sfi19, while a Cro-like repressor was detected. Downstream of the highly conserved DNA replication module 11 and 13 orfs were found in Sfi19 and phiSfi21, respectively: Two orfs from Sfi21 were replaced by a different gene and a duplication of the phage origin of replication in Sfi19; a further orf was only found in Sfi21. All other orfs from this region, which included a second putative phage repressor, were closely related between both phages. Two noncoding regions of Sfi19 showed sequence similarity to pST1, a small cryptic plasmid of S. thermophilus.
TI  - Starter culture activity in refrigerated fermented soymilk.
AB  - The refrigerated shelf life of soymilk fermented with single cultures of Lactobacillus fermentum, L. casei, Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, and Bifidobacterium longum was evaluated. During storage at 4 degrees C for 28 days, the stability of the microflora differed markedly among the starter cultures. After 28 days, the average numbers of S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus decreased by two log cycles to 6.0 x 10(7) CFU/ml, whereas those of L. casei increased gradually by more than two log cycles to 4.6 x 10(9) CFU/ml. Numbers of B. longum and L. fermentum remained moderately high (8.7 x 10(8) CFU/ml and 3.7 x 10(8) CFU/ml, respectively) even after 28 days of storage. S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus and L. casei continued to metabolize sucrose during the storage period, but the pattern of consumption was different among the strains. The other starter cultures did not seem to have significant activity (P > 0.05) on the residual sugars. In most cases, L(+)-lactate predominated.
TI  - Effect of the lactic acid bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus on ceramide levels in human keratinocytes in vitro and stratum corneum in vivo.
AB  - The effects of Streptococcus thermophilus on ceramide levels either in vitro on cultured human keratinocytes or in vivo on stratum corneum, have been investigated. In vitro, Streptococcus thermophilus enhanced the levels of ceramides in keratinocytes in a time-dependent way. The presence of high levels of neutral, glutathione-sensitive, sphingomyelinase in Streptococcus thermophilus could be responsible for the observed ceramide increase. The application of a base cream containing sonicated Streptococcus thermophilus in the forearm skin of 17 healthy volunteers for 7 d also led to a significant and relevant increase of skin ceramide amounts, which could be due to the sphingomyelin hydrolysis through bacterial neutral sphingomyelinase. Indeed, similar results were obtained with a base cream containing purified bacterial neutral sphingomyelinase. In addition, the inhibition of bacterial neutral sphingomyelinase activity through glutathione blocked the skin ceramide increase observed after the treatment. The topical application of a sonicated Streptococcus thermophilus preparation, leading to increased stratum corneum ceramide levels, could thus result in the improvement of lipid barrier and a more effective resistance against xerosis.
TI  - PepS from Streptococcus thermophilus. A new member of the aminopeptidase T family of thermophilic bacteria.
AB  - The proteolytic system of lactic acid bacteria is essential for bacterial growth  in milk but also for the development of the organoleptic properties of dairy products. Streptococcus thermophilus is widely used in the dairy industry. In comparison with the model lactic acid bacteria Lactococcus lactis, S. thermophilus possesses two additional peptidases (an oligopeptidase and the aminopeptidase PepS). To understand how S. thermophilus grows in milk, we purified and characterized this aminopeptidase. PepS is a monomeric metallopeptidase of approximately 45 kDa with optimal activity in the range pH 7.5-8.5 and at 55 degrees C on Arg-paranitroanilide as substrate. PepS exhibits a high specificity towards peptides possessing arginine or aromatic amino acids at the N-terminus. From the N-terminal protein sequence of PepS, we deduced degenerate oligonucleotides and amplified the corresponding gene by successive PCR reactions. The deduced amino-acid sequence of the PepS gene has high identity (40-50%) with the aminopeptidase T family from thermophilic and extremophilic bacteria; we thus propose the classification of PepS from S. thermophilus as a new member of this family. In view of its substrate specificity, PepS could be involved both in bacterial growth by supplying amino acids, and in the development of dairy products' flavour, by hydrolysing bitter peptides and liberating aromatic amino acids which are important precursors of aroma compounds.
TI  - Indication that the nitrogen source influences both amount and size of exopolysaccharides produced by streptococcus thermophilus LY03 and modelling of the bacterial growth and exopolysaccharide production in a complex medium
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus LY03 is a yogurt strain producing the same exopolysaccharide material in both milk and MRS broth. Actually, two types of exopolysaccharides are produced simultaneously. The two exopolysaccharides are identical in monomer composition (galactose and glucose in a 4:1 ratio) but differ in molecular size. Gel permeation chromatography revealed a high-molecular-mass exopolysaccharide (1.8 x 10(6)) and a low-molecular-mass exopolysaccharide (4.1 x 10(5)). Both exopolysaccharides can be isolated from the fermentation broth separately. The proportion in which they are produced is strongly dependent on the carbon/nitrogen ratio of the fermentation broth. A shift from a high-molecular-mass exopolysaccharide to a low-molecular-mass exopolysaccharide was observed with increasing initial complex nitrogen concentrations. All necessary biokinetic parameters to study the kinetics of S. thermophilus LY03 fermentations were obtained from a mathematical model which describes both S. thermophilus LY03 growth and exopolysaccharide production and degradation. The model is valid with various initial complex nitrogen concentrations and can be applied to simulate exopolysaccharide production in a milk medium.
TI  - Purification, characterization, gene cloning, sequencing, and overexpression of aminopeptidase N from Streptococcus thermophilus A.
AB  - The general aminopeptidase PepN from Streptococcus thermophilus A was purified to protein homogeneity by hydroxyapatite, anion-exchange, and gel filtration chromatographies. The PepN enzyme was estimated to be a monomer of 95 kDa, with maximal activity on N-Lys-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin at pH 7 and 37 degrees C. It was strongly inhibited by metal chelating agents, suggesting that it is a metallopeptidase. The activity was greatly restored by the bivalent cations Co2+, Zn2+, and Mn2+. Except for proline, glycine, and acidic amino acid residues, PepN has a broad specificity on the N-terminal amino acid of small peptides, but no significant endopeptidase activity has been detected. The N-terminal and short internal amino acid sequences of purified PepN were determined. By using synthetic primers and a battery of PCR techniques, the pepN gene was amplified, subcloned, and further sequenced, revealing an open reading frame of 2,541 nucleotides encoding a protein of 847 amino acids with a molecular weight of 96,252. Amino acid sequence analysis of the pepN gene translation product shows high homology with other PepN enzymes from lactic acid bacteria and exhibits the signature sequence of the zinc metallopeptidase family. The pepN gene was cloned in a T7 promoter-based expression plasmid and the 452-fold overproduced PepN enzyme was purified to homogeneity from the periplasmic extract of the host Escherichia coli strain. The overproduced enzyme showed the same catalytic characteristics as the wild-type enzyme.
TI  - Study of the possible mechanisms involved in the mucosal immune system activation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The induction of a mucosal immune response is not easy due to the development of  oral tolerance, but under some conditions, bacteria can activate this immune system. Antigens administered orally can interact with M cells of Peyer's patches or bind to the epithelial cells. We have demonstrated that certain lactic acid bacteria are able to induce specific secretory immunity, and others will enhance the gut inflammatory immune response. The aim of this work was to establish the reason for these different behaviors and to define possible mechanisms involved in the interaction of lactic acid bacteria at the intestinal level. We studied IgA+ and IgM+ B cells comparatively in bronchus and intestine and CD4+ T cells and IgA anti-lactic acid bacteria antibodies in the intestinal fluid, induced by oral administration of Lactobacillus casei, Lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lb. acidophilus, Lb. plantarum, Lb. rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis, and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. The increase in the IgA+ B cells in the bronchus means that these lactic acid bacteria were able to induce the IgA cycle by interaction with M cells from Peyer's patches or intestinal epithelial cells. The IgM+ cells increased when the stimulus did not induce the switch from IgM+ to IgA+. The increase in the CD4+ cells suggests interaction of Peyer's patches and enhancement of the B- and T-cell migration. The anti-lactic acid bacteria antibody is related to the processing and presentation of the microorganisms to the immune cells. We demonstrated that Lb. casei and Lb. plantarum were able to interact with Peyer's patch cells and showed an increase in IgA-, CD4+ cells, and antibodies specific for the stimulating strain. Lactobacillus acidophilus induced gut mucosal activation by interaction with the epithelial cells without increase in the immune cells associated with the bronchus. Although Lb. rhamnosus and Strep. salivarius ssp. thermophilus interact with epithelial cells, they also induced an immune response against their epitopes. Lactococcus lactis and Lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus induced an increase of IgA+ cells entering the IgA cycle but not CD4+ cells; thus, these bacteria would have been bound to epithelial cells that activated B lymphocytes without processing and presenting of their epitopes. We did not determine specific antibodies against Lc. lactis or Lb. bulgaricus.
TI  - Introduction of the exopolysaccharide gene cluster from Streptococcus thermophilus Sfi6 into Lactococcus lactis MG1363: production and characterization of an altered polysaccharide.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus Sfi6 produces an exopolysaccharide (EPS) composed of glucose, galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine in the molar ratio of 1:2:1. The genes responsible for the EPS biosynthesis have been isolated previously and found to be clustered in a 14.5 kb region encoding 13 genes. Transfer of this gene cluster into a non-EPS-producing heterologous host, Lactococcus lactis MG1363, yielded an EPS with a similar high molecular weight, but a different structure from the EPS from the native host. The structure of the recombinant EPS was determined by means of 1H homonuclear and 1H-13C heteronuclear two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra and was found to be --> 3)-beta-D-Glcp-(1 --> 3)-alpha-D-Galp-(1 --> 3)-beta-D-Galp-(1 --> as opposed to --> 3)[alpha-D-Galp-(1 --> 6)]-beta-D-Glcp-(1 --> 3)-alpha-D-GalpNAc-(1 --> 3)-beta-D-Galp-(1 --> for the wild-type S. thermophilus Sfi6. Furthermore, L. lactis MG1363 (pFS101) was also lacking a UDP-N-acetylglucosamine C4-epimerase activity, which would provide UDP-GalNAc for a GalNAc incorporation into the EPS and probably caused the substitution of GalNAc by Gal in the recombinant EPS. This modification implies that (i) bacterial glycosyltransferases could potentially have multiple specificities for the donor and the acceptor sugar molecule; and (ii) the repeating unit polymerase can recognize and polymerize a repeating unit that differs in the backbone as well as in the side-chain from its native substrate.
TI  - Are horizontal transfers involved in the evolution of the Streptococcus thermophilus exopolysaccharide synthesis loci?
AB  - A 32.5kb variable locus of the Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ368 chromosome, the eps locus, contains 25 ORF and seven insertion sequences (IS). The putative products of 17 ORF are related to proteins involved in the synthesis of polysaccharides in various bacteria. The two distal regions and a small central region of the eps locus are constant and present in all or almost all of the S. thermophilus strains tested. The other regions are variable and present in only some S. thermophilus strains tested, particularly in the closely related strains CNRZ368 and A054. A 13.6kb variable region of the eps locus of S. thermophilus CNRZ368 contains two ORF that are almost identical to epsL and orfY of the eps locus of Lactococcus lactis NIZOB40 and seven IS belonging to four different families, ISS1, IS981, IS1193 and IS1194. Five of these sequences were probably acquired by horizontal transfer from L. lactis (Bourgoin, F., et al., 1996. Gene 178, 15-23). Three probes of this 13.6kb region hybridized with the DNA of several L. lactis strains tested. A specific probe for another sequence within the S. thermophilus eps locus, epsF, hybridized with the DNA of one of the L. lactis strains tested. Sequence comparisons also suggest that five ORF of the eps locus have a mosaic structure and probably result from recombinations between sequences that are 10 to 50% divergent. The chimeric structure of the eps locus suggests a very complex evolution. This evolution probably involves both the acquisition of the 13.6kb region from L. lactis by horizontal transfer and exchanges within the S. thermophilus species.
TI  - Modulation of nonspecific mechanisms of defense by lactic acid bacteria: effective dose.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a fermented milk product containing Lactobacillus johnsonii La1 (formerly known as Lactobacillus acidophilus La1) on the phagocytic activity of peripheral blood leukocytes in healthy adult volunteers. Furthermore, we sought to define the effective doses of the bacteria, examine the effect on respiratory burst activity, and, finally, examine the contribution made by the starter culture to the biological effects. Volunteers were randomly distributed among three groups; each subject received one pot (150 ml) of fermented milk each day for 3 wk. The first two groups received a freshly prepared product fermented by Streptococcus thermophilus (group A) alone or S. thermophilus and 10(7) cfu/ml L. johnsonii La1 (group B). Group C received a product stored for a period of 21 to 28 d and that contained S. thermophilus and 10(6) cfu/ml of L. johnsonii La1. Ingestion of L. johnsonii La1 did not significantly increase fecal lactobacilli counts. However, L. johnsonii La1 was able to survive intestinal transit and was only recovered from the feces of the volunteers of groups B and C. The fermented base alone showed a weak effect on respiratory burst but not on phagocytic activity. However, the product containing 10(7) cfu/ml L. johnsonii La1 significantly enhanced both functions. The product containing 10(6) cfu/ml of L. johnsonii La1 had no significant effect on either function. These results suggest that fecal persistence may not necessarily reflect in vivo colonization and may not be a prerequisite for all forms of immune reactivity.
TI  - Streptococcus waius sp. nov., a thermophilic Streptococcus from a biofilm.
AB  - Thermophilic streptococci were isolated from biofilms on stainless steel samples  exposed to pasteurized skimmed milk and from dairy products from a dairy manufacturing plant. The phenotypic characters of these isolates were distinct from those of other thermophilic streptococci of dairy origin (Streptococcus thermophilus and Streptococcus bovis). Genotypic data [restriction endonuclease analysis, ribotyping, random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) profiles, DNA-DNA hybridization and G + C contents] support the classification of these isolates as a new species. The sequence of the 16S rRNA was compared with that of 29 species of streptococci and shown to be significantly different. The sequence of the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region also differed from published sequences of closely related species. A fluorescent in situ hybridization probe prepared to a specific part of the 16S rRNA gene sequence was able to distinguish the unknown isolates from reference isolates of S. thermophilus and S. bovis. It is proposed that these thermophilic streptococcal isolates from a dairy environment be classified in the genus Streptococcus as a new species, Streptococcus waius (from waiu, the New Zealand Maori word for milk). The type strain is 3/1T (= NZRCC 20100T).
TI  - [Comparative study of the homology of DNA in thermophilic and mesophilic lactococcal strains of various origin].
AB  - A comparative study of DNA homology among 12 strains of thermophilic streptococci currently used as ferments in the dairy industry in different regions of the CIS and 16 strains of mesophilic lactococci obtained from different sources was performed by the method of optical reassociation in solution. These strains were found to form three groups with DNA homology generally not exceeding 30-35% between each other. These data indicate that strains commonly classified as Streptococcus thermophilus may belong to different taxa. At the same time, the DNA base composition was similar in all these strains (the G + C content was 38-40 mol %). Among 16 strains of mesophilic lactococci DNA homology was generally higher than 50%, i.e., all these strains indeed belong to the same species, Lactococcus lactis.
TI  - Ingestion of yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium to potentiate immunoglobulin A responses to cholera toxin in mice.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria have been reported to have benefits for the prevention and treatment of some forms of diarrhea and related conditions. To determine whether these effects might involve direct stimulation of the gastrointestinal immune response, we administered yogurt to try to enhance mucosal and systemic antibodies against an orally presented immunogen, cholera toxin. Yogurts were manufactured with starter cultures containing different species and strains of lactic acid bacteria. Mice were fed these yogurts for 3 wk, during which they were also orally immunized twice with 10 micrograms of cholera toxin. Blood was collected on d 0 and 21, and fecal pellets were collected weekly. Mice that were immunized orally with cholera toxin responded by producing specific intestinal and serum immunoglobulin (Ig)A anti-cholera toxin. Antibody responses of the IgA isotype were significantly increased in mice fed yogurts made with starters containing the conventional yogurt bacteria Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus supplemented with Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Bifidobacterium infantis. Yogurt that was manufactured with starters containing only conventional yogurt bacteria produced less IgA anti-cholera toxin than did the control group fed nonfat dry milk. Although strong responses were also observed for IgG anti-cholera toxin in serum, the responses did not differ among groups. Thus, administration of yogurt supplemented with L. acidophilus and Bifidobacterium spp. enhanced mucosal and systemic IgA responses to the cholera toxin immunogen.
TI  - Structural and functional analysis of pCI65st, a 6.5 kb plasmid from Streptococcus thermophilus NDI-6.
AB  - The 6.5 kb cryptic plasmid pCI65st from Streptococcus thermophilus NDI-6, a strain isolated from the Indian fermented milk dahi, was subcloned and sequenced. Five putative ORFs were identified. ORF1 could encode a 315 aa polypeptide almost identical to the RepA protein of previously sequenced S. thermophilus plasmids, indicating that pCI65st is one of the pC194 group of small gram-positive rolling-circle plasmids. ORFs 2 and 4 were virtually identical and could specify proteins of approximately 150 aa with significant similarity to the small heat-shock proteins described from a variety of gram-positive bacteria. ORF3 could encode a 415 aa protein similar to enolase, an enzyme involved in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. ORF5 could encode a 412 aa protein which had high similarity to the HsdS (specificity) proteins of type I restriction-modification systems. Variants of strain NDI-6 which lacked pCI65st were readily isolated after subculture of the parent strain at 32 degrees C. The plasmid-bearing parent culture was significantly more resistant to a temperature shift from 42 degrees C to 62 degrees C than its plasmid-free variant and expressed proteins which corresponded with the predicted translation products from ORF2 and ORF4. In addition, plasmid-free mutants were lysed in broth by bacteriophages to which the parent culture was resistant.
TI  - Effects of lactic acid bacteria ingestion of basal cytokine mRNA and immunoglobulin levels in the mouse.
AB  - An increasing number of functional foods and pharmaceutical preparations containing lactic acid bacteria are being promoted with health claims based on the potential probiotic characteristics and on their capacity for stimulating the host immune system. However, the specific immune effects of oral administration of these microbes remain undefined. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that basal gastrointestinal immune status in mice is affected by orally administered lactic acid bacteria. The specific objective of this research was to evaluate the effects of repeated oral exposure to viable and nonviable lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. casei, and Streptococcus thermophilus) in mice on basal cytokine mRNA expression in mucosal (Peyer's patches), systemic (spleen), and lymphoid tissue and on immunoglobulin levels. The results indicated that oral exposure to 10(9) CFU/day for up to 14 days did not significantly affect basal interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, or interleukin-6 mRNA expression or total serum and intestinal immunoglobulins.
TI  - Note: evaluation of selective media for the enumeration of Bifidobacterium sp. in milk.
AB  - Pure cultures of three species of bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium longum, Bif. adolescentis and Bif. bifidum), Lactobacillus acidophilus and a mixed culture of Lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus were each enumerated on two differential media and six selective media for the enumeration of bifidobacteria. The appearance of the colonies on the differential media was as expected but when mixed cultures were present, it proved extremely difficult to distinguish one species from another. Of the selective media, AMC, RMS, NPNL and BL-OG performed well in that they gave good recoveries of bifidobacteria and were inhibitory to the growth of Lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Strep. salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lact. acidophilus. However, of these four media, AMC was most convenient as it is based on a commercially available medium, whereas the others must be made up from individual constituents. The AMC agar is thus a good choice for the routine enumeration of bifidobacteria from mixed cultures.
TI  - Electrotransformation of industrial strains of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - A standard electroporation procedure was utilized to introduce a range of Gram-positive plasmid vectors into nine industrial strains of Streptococcus thermophilus. All the strains were transformable with at least two of the plasmids assessed, but electrotransformation frequencies depended on both the strain and the nature of transforming DNA. In general, small rolling circle (RC) plasmids could be electroporated at high frequency into a wide range of strains with efficiencies of 10(2)-10(5) transformants microgram-1 of transforming DNA. The presence of these plasmids did not influence doubling times during growth in broth, and they were generally extremely stable in slow milk acidifying strains, with 85-100% of transformants retaining the selective markers over 105 generations. Vectors were less stable in fast-growing cultures. Of the three theta-type plasmids assessed, only one, pIL253, could be electroporated at low frequency into some slow growing strains. The presence of this plasmid caused a 40% increase in doubling time and it was lost from cells at a rate of 3% per generation. Attempts to alter the proteolytic status of slow acidifying strains of Strep. thermophilus by the introduction of heterologous proteinase genes are also described.
TI  - Complete genomic sequence of the lytic bacteriophage DT1 of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus lytic bacteriophage DT1, isolated from a mozzarella whey, was characterized at the microbiological and molecular levels. Phage DT1 had an isometric head of 60 nm and a noncontractile tail of 260 x 8 nm, two major structural proteins of 26 and 32 kDa, and a linear double-stranded DNA genome with cohesive ends at its extremities. The host range of phage DT1 was limited to 5 of the 21 S. thermophilus strains tested. Using S. thermophilus SMQ-301 as a host, phage DT1 had a burst size of 276 +/- 36 and a latent period of 25 min. The genome of phage DT1 contained 34,820 bp with a GC content of 39.1%. Forty-six open reading frames (ORFs) of more than 40 codons were found and putative functions were assigned to 20 ORFs, mostly in the late region of phage DT1. Comparative genomic analysis of DT1 with the completely sequenced S. thermophilus temperate phage O1205 revealed two large homologous regions interspersed by two heterologous segments. The homologous regions consisted of the early replication genes, the late morphogenesis genes, and the lysis cassette. The divergent segments contained the DNA packaging machinery, the major structural proteins, and remnants of a lysogeny module.
TI  - CtsR, a novel regulator of stress and heat shock response, controls clp and molecular chaperone gene expression in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - clpP and clpC of Bacillus subtillis encode subunits of the Clp ATP-dependent protease and are required for stress survival, including growth at high temperature. They play essential roles in stationary phase adaptive responses such as the competence and sporulation developmental pathways, and belong to the so-called class III group of heat shock genes, whose mode of regulation is unknown and whose expression is induced by heat shock or general stress conditions. The product of ctsR, the first gene of the clpC operon, has now been shown to act as a repressor of both clpP and clpC, as well as clpE, which encodes a novel member of the Hsp100 Clp ATPase family. The CtsR protein was purified and shown to bind specifically to the promoter regions of all three clp genes. Random mutagenesis, DNasel footprinting and DNA sequence deletions and comparisons were used to define a consensus CtsR recognition sequence as a directly repeated heptad upstream from the three clp genes. This target sequence was also found upstream from clp and other heat shock genes of several Gram-positive bacteria, including Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus salivarius, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. thermophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Leuconostoc oenos, Lactobacillus sake, Lactococcus lactis and Clostridium acetobutylicum. CtsR homologues were also identified in several of these bacteria, indicating that heat shock regulation by CtsR is highly conserved in Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Intestinal barrier function and cow's milk sensitization in guinea pigs fed milk  or fermented milk.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The respective effect of milk and fermented milks on intestinal barrier capacity and on sensitization to beta-lactoglobulin was studied using a guinea pig model of cow's milk allergy. METHODS: Guinea pigs were fed a control diet or the same diet supplemented with milk, fermented milk (Streptococcus thermophilus and Bifidobacterium breve), or dehydrated fermented milk. Intestinal barrier capacity to macromolecules was assessed in an Ussing chamber, and sensitization to cow's milk proteins was measured by systemic anti-beta-lactoglobulin immunoglobulin G1 titers and by intestinal anaphylaxis, the latter assessed by the beta-lactoglobulin-induced increase in short-circuit current of jejunal fragments (deltaIsc(beta-LG)). RESULTS: The electrical resistance of jejunum was similar in the four groups (approximately 80 omega/cm2) suggesting the same paracellular permeability. The transport of 14C-beta-lactoglobulin from mucosa to serosa was significantly decreased in the animals fed dehydrated fermented milk (403+/-131 ng / hr x cm2) compared with that in control animals or animals fed milk (767+/-250 ng / hr x cm2 and 749+/-475 ng / hr x cm2, respectively; p < 0.05). Milk fermentation did not modify native beta-lactoglobulin concentration but anti-beta-lactoglobulin immunoglobulin G1 titers were higher in fermented milk and dehydrated fermented milk (log10 titer = 2.86 and 2.79, respectively) than in guinea pigs fed milk (log10 titer = 2.5; p < 0.007). However, beta-lactoglobulin-induced intestinal anaphylaxis remained the same in the three groups (deltaIsc(beta-LG), 9.6+/-4.1 microA/cm2, 8.5+/-4.3 microA/cm2, and 8.5+/-3.4 microA/cm2 in milk-fed, fermented milk-fed, and dehydrated fermented milk-fed guinea pigs, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The intestinal barrier capacity to milk proteins seems to be reinforced by dehydrated fermented milk, but milk and fermented milks are equally efficient in inducing cow's milk allergy in guinea pigs.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria growth promoters from Spirulina platensis.
AB  - Spirulina has been used for many years as human food because of its high protein  content and nutritional value. Some strains also produce bioactive substances that may inhibit or promote microbial growth. Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus bulgaricus were grown in rich media, MRS and RM, as well as in minimal saline medium with and without addition of extracellular products obtained from a late log phase culture of Spirulina platensis in Zarrouk medium. In both MRS and RM media, the extracellular products significantly promote the growth of the lactic acid bacteria assayed. This stimulatory effect was observed in media with pH adjusted to 5.3, 6.3 and 7.0. No effect was observed in minimal saline medium.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a lysis module present in a large proportion of bacteriophages infecting Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - A lysis module encoded by the temperate bacteriophage phiO1205 was identified. This lysis module contains a lysin gene, designated lyt51, and two putative holin-encoding genes, designated lyt49 and lyt50. lyt51 encodes a lytic enzyme specifically directed against streptococcal cell walls. Similar to other phage-encoded lysins, Lyt51 appears to have a modular design in which the N-terminal portion corresponds to its enzymatic activity while the C-terminal region is responsible for its substrate binding specificity. The two putative holin-encoding genes, lyt49 and lyt50, located immediately upstream of lyt51, were identified on the basis of their homology to other identified holin-encoding genes. Expression of lyt49 or lyt50 in Escherichia coli was shown to cause cell death and leakage of the intracellular enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase into the growth medium without apparent lysis of the cells. Southern blotting experiments demonstrated that at least one of the three components of the identified lysis module is present in all members of a large collection of bacteriophages, indicating that components of this lysis module are widespread among bacteriophages infecting Streptococcus thermophilus.
TI  - Nisin independent induction of the nisA promoter in Lactococcus lactis during growth in lactose or galactose.
AB  - Nisin biosynthesis is autoregulated extracellularly by the mature and modified peptide. To investigate other regulatory effects on nisin biosynthesis, a transcription fusion of the nisA promoter from Lactococcus lactis ATCC 11454 to the promoterless lacZ gene from Streptococcus thermophilus was constructed. This fusion construct, pDOC99, expressed beta-galactosidase in L. lactis ATCC 11454 growing in M17 medium containing glucose (M17G). Consistent with the known model for transcription of nisA, pDOC99 did not express beta-galactosidase in the non-nisin producer, L. lactis LM0230 grown in M17G, unless the nisRK genes (cloned in pDOC23) were included in trans and nisin was added to the medium. Growth of this strain in M17 containing lactose or galactose, resulted in nisA transcription, even in the absence of exogenous nisin. This expression was independent of pDOC23. Furthermore, nisA transcription in L. lactis LM0230(pDOC99) grown in M17G could be induced by the addition of exogenous galactose, with maximum induction occurring at concentrations > 5 mM.
TI  - Bacteria used for the production of yogurt inactivate carcinogens and prevent DNA damage in the colon of rats.
AB  - Lactic acid-producing bacteria prevent carcinogen-induced preneoplastic lesions and tumors in rat colon. Because the mechanisms responsible for these protective effects are unknown, two strains of lactic acid bacteria, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 191R and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus CH3, that are used to produce yogurt, were investigated in vitro and in vivo to elucidate their potential to deactivate carcinogens. Using the "Comet assay" to detect genetic damage, we found that L. bulgaricus 191R applied orally to rats could prevent 1, 2-dimethylhydrazine-induced DNA breaks in the colon in vivo, whereas St. thermophilus CH3 were not effective. However, in vitro, both strains prevented DNA damage induced by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) in isolated primary rat colon cells. Extracts prepared from milk fermented with St. thermophilus CH3 were as efficient in deactivating MNNG as was L-cysteine. Isolated metabolites arising from bacteria during fermentation in the colon or in milk [L(+) lactate, D(-) lactate, palmitic acid and isopalmitic acid] were not effective. We postulate that thiol-containing breakdown products of proteins, via catalysis by bacterial proteases, could be one mechanism by which MNNG or other carcinogens are deactivated in the gut lumen resulting in reduced damage to colonic mucosal cells.
TI  - Phosphorylation and functional properties of the IIA domain of the lactose transport protein of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The lactose-H+ symport protein (LacS) of Streptococcus thermophilus has a carboxyl-terminal regulatory domain (IIALacS) that is homologous to a family of proteins and protein domains of the phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS) in various organisms, of which IIAGlc of Escherichia coli is the best-characterized member. On the basis of these similarities, it was anticipated that IIALacS would be able to perform one or more functions associated with IIAGlc, i.e., carry out phosphoryl transfer and/or affect other catabolic functions. The gene fragment encoding IIALacS was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the protein was purified in two steps by metal affinity and anion-exchange chromatography. IIALacS was unable to restore glucose uptake in a IIAGlc-deficient strain, which is consistent with a very low rate of phosphorylation of IIALacS by phosphorylated HPr (HPr approximately P) from E. coli. With HPr approximately P from S. thermophilus, the rate was more than 10-fold higher, but the rate constants for the phosphorylation of IIALacS (k1 = 4.3 x 10(2) M-1 s-1) and dephosphorylation of IIALacS approximately P by HPr (k-1 = 1.1 x 10(3) M-1 s-1) are still at least 4 orders of magnitude lower than for the phosphoryltransfer between IIAGlc and HPr from E. coli. This finding suggests that IIALacS has evolved into a protein domain whose main function is not to transfer phosphoryl groups rapidly. On the basis of sequence alignment of IIA proteins with and without putative phosphoryl transfer functions and the known structure of IIAGlc, we constructed a double mutant [IIALacS(I548E/G556D)] that was predicted to have increased phosphoryl transfer activity. Indeed, the phosphorylation rate of IIALacS(I548E/G556D) by HPr approximately P increased (k1 = 4.0 x 10(3) M-1 s-1) and became nearly independent of the source of HPr approximately P (S. thermophilus, Bacillus subtilis, or E. coli). The increased phosphoryl transfer rate of IIALacS(I548E/G556D) was insufficient to complement IIAGlc in PTS-mediated glucose transport in E. coli. Both IIALacS and IIALacS(I548E/G556D) could replace IIAGlc, but in another function: they inhibited glycerol kinase (inducer exclusion) when present in the unphosphorylated form.
TI  - Persistence of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in dairy fermentation systems.
AB  - We examined (i) the persistence of Escherichia coli O157:H7 as a postpasteurization contaminant in fermented dairy products; (ii) the ability of E. coli O157:H7 strains with and without the general stress regulatory protein, RpoS, to compete with commercial starter cultures in fermentation systems; and (iii) the survival of E. coli O157:H7 in the yogurt production process. In commercial products inoculated with 10(3) CFU/ml, E. coli O157:H7 was recovered for up to 12 days in yogurt (pH 4.0), 28 days in sour cream (pH 4.3), and at levels > 10(2) CFU/ml at 35 days in buttermilk (pH 4.1). For the starter culture competition trials, the relative inhibition of E. coli O157:H7 in the experimental fermentation systems was, in decreasing order, thermophilic culture mixture, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus R110 alone, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis D280 alone, Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris D62 alone, and Streptococcus thermophilus C90 alone showing the least inhibition. Recovery of the rpoS mutant was lower than recovery of its wild-type parent by 72 h or earlier in the presence of individual starter cultures. No E. coli O157:H7 were recovered after the curd formation step in yogurt manufactured with milk inoculated with 10(5) CFU/ml. Our results show that (i) postprocessing entry of E. coli O157:H7 into fermented dairy products represents a potential health hazard; (ii) commercial starter cultures differ in their ability to reduce E. coli O157:H7 CFU numbers in fermentation systems; and (iii) the RpoS protein appears to most effectively contribute to bacterial survival in the presence of conditions that are moderately lethal to the cell.
TI  - Production of cholera toxin B subunit in Lactobacillus.
AB  - The intracellular expression of the B subunit of cholera toxin (CTB) was first achieved in Lactobacillus paracasei LbTGS1.4 with an expression cassette including the P25 promoter of Streptococcus thermophilus combined with the translation initiation region from the strongly expressed L. pentosus D-lactate dehydrogenase gene (ldhD). Secretion of CTB was next attempted in L. paracasei LbTGS1.4 and L. plantarum NCIMB8826 with four different signal sequences from exported proteins of lactic acid bacteria (Lactococcus lactis Usp45 and PrtP, Enterococcus faecalis unknown protein and S. pyogenes M6 protein). Host-dependent secretion of CTB was clearly observed: whereas none of the secretion cassettes led to detectable CTB in the extracellular fraction of L. paracasei LbTGS1.4, secretion of CTB molecules was clearly achieved with three of the selected signal sequences in L. plantarum NCIMB8826.
TI  - Distribution of plasmid-borne stress protein genes in Streptococcus thermophilus  and other lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The presence of heat stress protein genes (hsp) was tested by Southern hybridization analysis in total DNA extracts from species of the genus Streptococcus (47 strains), Lactobacillus (34 strains), Lactococcus (24 strains), and Leuconostoc (5 strains). The biotinylated hsp16.4 probe prepared from an ORF2 fragment of pER341 (2.8 kb) tested positively with restricted DNA extracts of seven Streptococcus thermophilus strains and a single strain of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris. In all positive S. thermophilus strains, the hsp was located on plasmids ranging from ca. 2.8 kb to 11 kb in size, while hsp was present in a 7.5-kb plasmid in Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris. Southern blots with a rep probe showed that all hsp16.4+ plasmids in S. thermophilus strains also shared homology with the replication function (rep) of pER341, suggesting the common origin of these plasmids.
TI  - Production of amino acids by yogurt bacteria.
AB  - The dynamics of free amino acid production by the selected strains Streptococcus  thermophilus 13a and Lactobacillus bulgaricus 2-11 were studied in pure and mixed cultivations during yogurt starter culture manufacture. L. bulgaricus 2-11 showed the highest activity for producing free amino acids with high individual concentrations over the first hour of growth (50% of the total amount). By the end of milk's full coagulation (4.5 h), 70% of the total amount of amino acids was released. S. thermophilus 13a showed poor proteolytic properties and consumed up to 70% of the free amino acids produced by L. bulgaricus 2-11 in the process of coagulation of milk with the mixed culture.
TI  - Ingredient supplementation effects on viability of probiotic bacteria in yogurt.
AB  - The present investigation studied the effects of cysteine, whey powder, whey protein concentrate, acid casein hydrolysates, or tryptone on the viability of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacteria. Changes in pH, titratable acidity, redox potential, and viability of bacteria were monitored during 24 h of fermentation and refrigerated storage (4 degrees C) of yogurt for 35 d. The incubation time that was needed to reach pH 4.5 was considerably affected by the added ingredients. Also, the drop in pH or the increase in acidity and redox potential was dependent on the added ingredients. The addition of cysteine, whey protein concentrate, acid casein hydrolysates, or tryptone improved the viability of bifidobacteria to a variable extent, but whey powder failed to improve their viability. The morphology of S. thermophilus, as shown by electron microscopy, was affected by cysteine at 500 mg/L, possibly as a result of reduced redox potential. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE and amino acid analyses suggested that the nitrogen source in the form of peptides and amino acids improved the viability of bifidobacteria in yogurt made with a commercial ABT (Lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacteria, and Streptococcus thermophilus) starter culture, which showed a dramatic decline in the counts of this organism in previous studies.
TI  - Comparison of Streptococcus thermophilus strains by pulse field gel electrophoresis of genomic DNA.
AB  - Pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was utilised to compare the genomes of 16  Streptococcus thermophilus cultures from yoghurt, cheese, laban and dahi after digestion with the restriction endonucleases, SfiI, SmaI and BssHII. PFGE profiles could be used for strain identification and were also useful in predicting relatedness of certain strains. Genetic variations between specific morphotypes of a highly proteolytic culture were not detectable by PFGE in this study. Statistical analysis of SmaI restriction patterns enabled the clustering of strains into two groups which corresponded with biochemical properties of the strains examined and suggested that PFGE profiles could be useful in predicting biochemical characteristics.
TI  - The exopolysaccharides produced by Streptococcus thermophilus Rs and Sts have the same repeating unit but differ in viscosity of their milk cultures.
AB  - The polysaccharides produced by Streptococcus thermophilus Rs and Sts in skimmed  milk consist of D-Gal and L-Rha in a molar ratio of 5:2. Linkage analysis and 1D/2D NMR (1H and 13C) studies revealed that both polysaccharides have the same branched heptasaccharide repeating unit: [formula: see text] Remarkably, the two strains differ in their effects on the viscosity of stirred milk cultures. The milk culture of S. thermophilus Rs is non-ropy and affords 135 mg/L polysaccharide with an average molecular mass of 2.6 x 10(3) kDa. In contrast, the milk culture of S. thermophilus Sts is ropy and produces 127 mg/L polysaccharide with an average molecular mass of 3.7 x 10(3) kDa. Permeability measurements of non-stirred milk cultures of both strains suggest that both strains have a similar effect on the protein-polysaccharide network. Therefore, the only clear difference between both strains, which may cause the difference in ropiness of the milk cultures, is the difference in molecular mass of the polysaccharide.
TI  - Detergent-mediated reconstitution of membrane proteins.
AB  - The efficiency of reconstitution of the lactose transport protein (LacS) of Streptococcus thermophilus is markedly higher with Triton X-100 than with other detergents commonly employed to mediate the membrane insertion. To rationalize these differences, the lipid/detergent structures that are formed in the reconstitution process were studied by cryotransmission electron microscopy. Surprisingly, the two nonionic detergents Triton X-100 and n-dodecyl beta-D-maltoside (DDM) affected the liposome structures in a completely different manner. Preformed liposomes titrated with Triton X-100 maintained their bilayer structure far beyond the onset of solubilization, and transport activity was maximal when LacS was inserted into these structures. With DDM the vesicular structures were already disrupted at the onset of solubilization and these membrane sheets were converted into long threadlike micelles at higher DDM to lipid ratios. Triton X-100 allowed the protein to be reconstituted with the hydrophilic surface exposed to the outside, whereas LacS was incorporated randomly when DDM was used. These differences in orientation are readily explained by the different lipid-detergent structures formed by Triton X-100 and DDM. The orientation of the reconstituted LacS protein is a critical factor for the activity of the protein as the kinetics of translocation is very different for opposite directions of transport.
TI  - A short noncoding viral DNA element showing characteristics of a replication origin confers bacteriophage resistance to Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - A 302-bp noncoding DNA fragment from the DNA replication module of phage phiSfi21 was shown to protect the Streptococcus thermophilus strain Sfi1 from infection by 17 of 25 phages. The phage-inhibitory DNA possesses two determinants, each of which individually mediated phage resistance. The phage-inhibitory activity was copy number dependent and operates by blocking the accumulation of phage DNA. Furthermore, when cloned on a plasmid, the phiSfi21 DNA acts as an origin of replication driven by phage infection. Protein or proteins in the phiSfi21-infected cells were shown to interact with this phage-inhibitory DNA fragment, forming a retarded protein-DNA complex in gel retardation assays. A model in which phage proteins interact with the inhibitory DNA such that they are no longer available for phage propagation can be used to explain the observed bacteriophage resistance. Genome analysis of phiSfi19, a phage that is insensitive to the inhibitory activity of the phiSfi21-derived DNA, led to the characterisation of a variant putative phage replication origin that differed in 14 of 302 nucleotides from that of phiSfi21. The variant origin was cloned and exhibited an inhibitory activity toward phages that were insensitive to the phiSfi21-derived DNA.
TI  - Conservation of the major cold shock protein in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Primers designed from consensus regions of the major cold shock gene of different bacterial species were used in PCR amplification of Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB). An appropriately-sized PCR product was obtained from Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis LL43-1 and MG1363; Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris LC10-1, LC11-1, and LC12-1; Streptococcus thermophilus ST1-1; Enterococcus faecalis EF1-1; Lactobacillus acidophilus LA1-1; Lactobacillus helveticus LH1-1; Pediococcus pentosaceus PP1-1; and Bifidobacterium animalis BA1-1. The PCR products were cloned and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequences displayed high sequence similarity with the major cold shock proteins of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis and the human Y-box factor. The amino acid residues of the cold shock domain implicated in nucleic acid binding in several unrelated species were also highly conserved in the LAB strains. It is possible, therefore, that this protein in LAB may also act as a transcriptional enhancer to other cold shock genes and/or act as an RNA chaperone unwinding tightly folded RNA molecules.
TI  - Characterization of a novel Streptococcus thermophilus rolling-circle plasmid used for vector construction.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence of pER371, a native plasmid in Streptococcus thermophilus ST137, was determined. A putative open reading frame coding for a replication protein, Rep371, was identified. A characteristic promoter sequence and ribosome-binding site were found upstream of rep371. Rep371 (247 amino acid residues) does not show homology with RepA and RepS of the small S. thermophilus cryptic plasmids pST1-No.29 and pST1 respectively. The plus-origin sequence and Rep371 are highly homologous to the corresponding elements of the Staphylococcus aureus plasmids pC194 and pSK89. A novel 140-nucleotide palindromic minusorigin sequence, which is structurally similar but does not show sequence homology to the palA region of pC194, was identified in pER371. A palindromic sequence capable of forming a putative hairpin structure was identified and subsequently recognized as being highly conserved among several lactococcal rolling-circle plasmids. Cloning vectors derived from pER371 should provide valuable gene-delivery vehicles for the genetic engineering of lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Characterization of bacteriocins produced by strains from traditional Bulgarian dairy products.
AB  - A result of extensive screening of over 300 strains from the Collection of ELBY Bulgaricum, PLC, thirty six strains were selected as producers of bacteriocins, active closely related lactic acid bacterial species and some food spoilage bacteria. The selected strains belong to L. helveticus, L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus, which are rare bacteriocin producers. Nineteen nonidentified producers were characterized by molecular taxonomic approaches--M13 fingerprinting, repetitive PCR, ribotyping and hybridization with species-specific probes, which allowed to affiliate them to the species L. delbrueckii. Several strains were found to harbour plasmids of different size. The estimated activity against food borne pathogens makes the isolated substances perspective as safe food preservatives and the producing strains could be used as components of starters with improved quality.
TI  - Identification of streptococci from Greek Kasseri cheese and description of Streptococcus macedonicus sp. nov.
AB  - Taxonomic studies were performed on some Streptococcus-like organisms isolated from naturally fermented Greek Kasseri cheese. By SDS-PAGE analysis of whole-cell proteins the group was found to be quite different from Streptococcus thermophilus. Comparative 16S and 23S rRNA sequence analyses showed that the isolates represent a new species within the genus Streptococcus, where they are most closely related to the Streptococcus bovis cluster. On the basis of these phylogenetic results and some phenotypic differences, a new species, Streptococcus macedonicus, is proposed. The type strain is ACA-DC 206.
TI  - Characterization of a bacteriocin produced by Streptococcus thermophilus 81.
AB  - A new bacteriocin, produced by Streptococcus thermophilus 81 has been isolated, purified and characterized. By its heat sensitivity and broad inhibitory spectrum it does not resemble any other S. thermophilus bacteriocin. The mode of action is bacteriostatic. This peptide of 32 amino acids is efficient against several Bacillus species, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Yersinia enterocolitica. This bacteriocin is heat labile but its activity was not altered by pH variation from 3 to 10. Six months of storage at 40 degrees C did not influence the activity. The inactivation by detergents and the inability to resolve the protein in SDS-PAGE supposes a more complex structure or a possible stabilizing effect of other molecules. The low sensitivity of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus to the isolated bacteriocin suggests that S. thermophilus 81 may be used in yoghurt starters.
TI  - Preliminary characterization of microflora of Comte cheese.
AB  - The evolution of the microflora of three Comte cheeses made in duplicate with raw milk from three different sources was followed during ripening. The same starter was used with each type of milk. The comparison of the cheeses did not reveal any significant difference in the development of the microflora. Starter lactic acid bacteria (Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus helveticus), which are added at the beginning of manufacture, decreased quickly in the first stages of ripening supporting the hypothesis of cell autolysis. Other microorganisms, i.e. homofermentative and heterofermentative lactobacilli (Lact. delbrueckii ssp. lactis, Lact. paracasei ssp. paracasei, Lact. rhamnosus and Lact. fermentum), pediococci, enterococci and propionibacteria grew in cheese from small numbers in fresh curd. The characterization of Strep. thermophilus by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed that wild strains were also able to grow in the curd. The values for the genome size of 11 Strep. thermophilus strains determined in this investigation were in the range of 1.8-2.3 Mbp. The potential role of starter and raw milk microflora in cheese flavour development was considered.
TI  - Random amplified polymorphic DNA and amplified ribosomal DNA spacer polymorphism: powerful methods to differentiate Streptococcus thermophilus strains.
AB  - Streptococci from different collections and dairy materials were characterized by conventional and molecular methods. After amplification of the 16S-23S rDNA spacer region, all the strains referable to the genus Streptococcus exhibited a single polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product, allowing their differentiation from enterococci. Cleaving this PCR product with Hae III, two different restriction patterns could be observed, allowing Streptococcus salivarius DSM 20560T, Strep. thermophilus NCDO 822 and two strains of Streptococcus spp. to be gathered in one group and all the other strains in another. In order to achieve strain typing, all the cultures were investigated by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR analysis employing two selected primers. The results were treated by cluster analysis, appearing significantly consistent with both the taxonomic position and the origin of the strains. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of Sma I digests of the genomic DNA from 11 representative strains with decreasing levels of RAPD similarity allowed their diversity to be confirmed, even though RAPD-PCR proved to be less discriminating than PFGE analysis. The results are discussed with reference to the capability of the analytical procedures used to aid both identification and strain typing of streptococci, as well as the taxonomic structure of the species Strep. thermophilus.
TI  - Production by and isolation of exopolysaccharides from Streptococcus thermophilus grown in a milk medium and evidence for their growth-associated biosynthesis.
AB  - Four Streptococcus thermophilus strains (Strep. thermophilus BTC, Strep. thermophilus LY03, Strep. thermophilus 480 and Strep. thermophilus Sfi20) have been examined for their exopolysaccharide production capacity. All strains produced a polymer composed of the neutral sugars glucose and galactose, but in different ratios. It was clearly shown that the biosynthesis of exopolysaccharides from Strep. thermophilus LY03 is growth-associated and hence displays primary metabolite kinetics. The monomer ratio of the exopolysaccharide synthesized did not vary throughout the fermentation cycle. The production kinetics and exopolysaccharide yields were strongly dependent on the fermentation conditions. Physical factors such as temperature, pH and oxygen tension as well as chemical factors (medium composition, initial lactose concentration, carbon/nitrogen levels) were of utmost importance.
TI  - Small cryptic plasmids of Streptococcus pneumoniae belong to the pC194/pUB110 family of rolling circle plasmids.
AB  - The DNA sequences of two related plasmids pPR1 and pPR3 described previously in Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from Germany and Spain were now determined. Both plasmids belong to a family of rolling circle (RC) plasmids found in a variety of bacteria. Their GC content with 32% is lower than that of the S. pneumoniae chromosomal DNA. The plasmid pPR3 has a molecular size of 3160 bp with four putative open reading frames, whereas pPR1 contained a deletion of 313 bp that included the 5'-part of ORF2 and upstream regions and differed by three bp from pPR3. The predicted protein of ORF1 showed high similarity to replication proteins of RC plasmids with 74% identical amino acids to RepA of Streptococcus thermophilus plasmids. Sequences similar to the plus origin of replication of ssDNA plasmids were present in both plasmids. They also contained a 152-bp region with over 83% identity to the minus origin of replication of the Streptococcus agalacticae plasmid pMV158.
TI  - Characterization of extracellular beta-lactamases from penicillin G-resistant cells of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - In this study, biochemical properties of two extracellular beta-lactamases produced by penicillin-resistant Streptococcus thermophilus cells were investigated. Both beta-lactamases showed specificity for penicillins but not for cephaloridins. The beta-lactamases exhibited different affinities for penicillin G. The one with the higher molecular weight (FI) had a Km value of 3.44 microM and a Vmax value of 8.33 mumol/min/mg of protein, whereas the beta-lactamase with the lower molecular weight (FII) had a Km value of 4.76 microM and a Vmax value of 3.13 mumol/min/mg of protein. Both beta-lactamases were inhibited by iodine, copper sulfate, and iron sulfate but not by EDTA. The optimal pH ranged between 6 and 7, and the optimal temperatures were between 40 and 45 degrees C for both enzymes.
TI  - Stimulation of cytokine production in clonal macrophage and T-cell models by Streptococcus thermophilus: comparison with Bifidobacterium sp. and Lactobacillus bulgaricus.
AB  - The effects of four commercial strains of Streptococcus thermophilus used in yogurt manufacturing on cytokine production were evaluated by using a macrophage model (RAW 264.7 cells) and a T-helper-cell model (EL4.IL-2 thymoma cells) and compared to immunologically active strains of Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, and Bifidobacterium bifidum. All cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-6 in RAW 264.7 cells and IL-2 and IL-5 in EL4.IL-2 cells) were affected by heat-killed S. thermophilus in a strain- and dose-dependent fashion. Organisms of all three genera induced significant increases in IL-6 production by the macrophage line ranging from 31- to 192-fold, with S. thermophilus St 133 showing the greatest activity. The four S. thermophilus strains also strongly induced TNF-alpha production (from 135- to 176-fold). IL-6 and, to a lesser extent, TNF-alpha production were also increased when the macrophages were costimulated with lipopolysaccharide and cells of the three groups of lactic acid bacteria. Upon concurrent stimulation of EL4.IL-2 cells with phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate, seven of the eight strains displayed significant enhancement of IL-2 and IL-5 production, with S. thermophilus being most effective. Taken together, the S. thermophilus strains stimulated macrophage and T-cell cytokine production to a similar or greater extent than did the species of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus. These and previous results lend further support to the contention that lactic acid bacteria, in a concentration-dependent manner, can differentially induce cytokine production in macrophages, but that the effects on T cells required a costimulatory signal and were less remarkable.
TI  - Structural and functional properties of the hsp16.4-bearing plasmid pER341 in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The plasmid pER341 (2798 bp) of Streptococcus thermophilus ST134 was sequenced and its open reading frame (ORF) regions were characterized. Analysis of nucleotide sequences showed the putative translation product of ORF1 (rep) sharing a high level of homology with replication proteins of several small plasmids present in lactic acid bacteria and staphylococci. This and homology of regions of plus-strand (ORI) and minus-strand (ssoA) origin of replication with pC194-class plasmids indicated that pER341 replicates by the rolling-circle mechanism. ORF2 corresponded to a putative hsp gene that apparently encodes Hsp16.4, a 142-amino-acid heat stress protein. Hsp16.4 shared significant identity with other small, 18-kDa-class heat stress proteins from prokaryotic and eukaryotic sources. Hsp16.4 is apparently the first plasmidborne low-molecular-weight heat stress protein reported in dairy fermentation bacteria with a potential role in temperature-regulated functions in S. thermophilus.
TI  - Characterization of a novel insertion sequence, IS1194, in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - A novel insertion sequence, IS1194, has been identified in the lactic acid bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ368. This 1200-bp element has 16-bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats. The single large open reading frame of this element encodes a 332-amino-acid protein that displays similarities with transposases encoded by bacterial insertion sequences belonging to the IS5 group of the IS4 family. A single copy of IS1194 was detected by hybridization in only 2 of the 19 S. thermophilus strains tested and in 4 of the 13 Lactococcus lactis strains investigated. This suggests that this IS element was acquired by horizontal transfer. The unique IS1194 copy of S. thermophilus CNRZ368 is located in a region of at least 12 kb that was probably acquired by horizontal transfer from L. lactis. Furthermore, the IS1194 right end is identical to sequences found in a broad-host-range conjugative plasmid from Streptococcus pyogenes, pSM19035.
TI  - The structural gene module in Streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophage phi Sfi11  shows a hierarchy of relatedness to Siphoviridae from a wide range of bacterial hosts.
AB  - The structural gene cluster and the lysis module from lytic group II Streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophage phi Sfi11 was compared to the corresponding region from other Siphoviridae. The analysis revealed a hierarchy of relatedness. phi Sfi11 differed from the temperate S. thermophilus bacteriophage phi O1205 by about 10% at the nucleotide level. The majority of the changes were point mutations, mainly at the third base position. Only a single gene (orf 695) differed substantially between the two phages. Over the putative minor tail and lysis genes, phi Sfi11 and the lytic group 1 S. thermophilus phi Sfi19 shared regions with variable degrees of similarity. Orf 1291 from phi Sfi19 was replaced by four genes in phi Sfi11, two of which (orf 1000 and orf 695) showed a complicated pattern of similarity and nonsimilarity compared with phi Sfi19. The predicted orf 695 gp resembles the receptor-recognizing protein of T-even coliphages in its organization, but not its sequence. No sequence similarity was detected between phi Sfi11 and phi Sfi19 in the region covering the major head and tail genes. Comparison of the structural gene map of phi Sfi11 with that of Siphoviridae from gram-positive and -negative bacterial hosts revealed a common genomic organization. Sequence similarity was only found between phi Sfi11 and Siphoviridae from gram-positive hosts and correlated with the evolutionary distance between the bacterial hosts. Our data are compatible with the hypothesis that the structural gene operon from Siphoviridae of the low G + C group of gram-positive bacteria is derived from a common ancestor.
TI  - Purification and characterization of thermophilin T, a novel bacteriocin produced by Streptococcus thermophilus ACA-DC 0040.
AB  - ACA-DC 0040 produced an antimicrobial agent, which was named thermophilin T, active against several lactic acid bacteria strains of different species and food spoilage bacteria, such as Clostridium sporogenes C22/10 and Cl. tyrobutyricum NCDO-1754. The crude antimicrobial compound is sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and alpha-amylase, heat-stable (100 degrees C for 30 min), resistant to pH exposure at pH 1-12 and demonstrates a bactericidal mode of action against the sensitive strain Lactococcus cremoris CNRZ-117. The production of bacteriocin was optimized approximately 10-fold in an aerobic fermenter held at constant pH 5.8 and 6.2. Ultrafiltration experiments with culture supernatant fluids containing the bacteriocin, and further estimation of molecular weight with gel filtration chromatography, revealed that bacteriocin in the native form has a molecular weight in excess of 300 kDa. SDS-gel electrophoresis of partially purified thermophilin T showed that bacteriocin activity was associated with a protein band of approximately 2.5 kDa molecular mass.
TI  - Cell-free whey from milk fermented with Bifidobacterium breve C50 used to modify  the colonic microflora of healthy subjects.
AB  - The ingestion of viable bacteria is thought to be required to modify intestinal microflora. In the present study, the effects on fecal flora of consumption of cell-free concentrated whey from milk that had been fermented with Bifidobacterium breve C50 was tested using 10 healthy human volunteers. Results were compared with effects of a commercial milk formula that had been fermented with Streptococcus thermophilus and B. breve C50 and given to 10 control subjects. Nitroreductase and beta-glucuronidase activities were assessed as risk indexes for colon carcinogenesis, and beta-galactosidase was measured as an indicator of the fermentation capacity of the colonic flora. Fecal excretion of Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and clostridial spores decreased after 7 d of consumption of either preparation; however, counts of bifidobacteria only increased after intake of B. breve whey. Fecal pH was reduced from 7.1 +/- 0.2 to 6.6 +/- 0.3 after intake of whey that had been fermented with Bif. breve. Fecal nitroreductase and beta-glucuronidase significantly decreased, and beta-galactosidase activity increased, after consumption of either preparation. The results indicate that ingestion of viable bifidobacteria was not required to modify intestinal flora of humans. Repression of B. fragilis and clostridia seems to be independent of colonic bifidobacterial overgrowth in humans.
TI  - Role of Streptococcus thermophilus MR-1C capsular exopolysaccharide in cheese moisture retention.
AB  - Recent work by our group has shown that an exopolysaccharide (EPS)-producing starter pair, Streptococcus thermophilus MR-1C and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus MR-1R, can significantly increase moisture retention in low-fat mozzarella (D. B. Perry, D. J. McMahon, and C. J. Oberg, J. Dairy Sci. 80:799-805, 1997). The objectives of this study were to determine whether MR-1C, MR-1R, or both of these strains are required for enhanced moisture retention and to establish the role of EPS in this phenomenon. Analysis of low-fat mozzarella made with different combinations of MR-1C, MR-1R, and the non-EPS-producing starter culture strains S. thermophilus TA061 and Lactobacillus helveticus LH100 showed that S. thermophilus MR-1C was responsible for the increased cheese moisture level. To investigate the role of the S. thermophilus MR-1C EPS in cheese moisture retention, the epsE gene in this bacterium was inactivated by gene replacement. Low-fat mozzarella made with L. helveticus LH100 plus the non-EPS-producing mutant S. thermophilus DM10 had a significantly lower moisture content than did cheese made with strains LH100 and MR-1C, which confirmed that the MR-1C capsular EPS was responsible for the water-binding properties of this bacterium in cheese. Chemical analysis of the S. thermophilus MR-1C EPS indicated that the polymer has a novel basic repeating unit composed of D-galactose, L-rhamnose, and L-fucose in a ratio of 5:2:1.
TI  - Effect of fermented milk intake on plasmid transfer and on the persistence of transconjugants in the digestive tract of gnotobiotic mice.
AB  - Plasmid transfer occurs in the digestive tract and the transconjugants may become durably established. The aim of the present work is to investigate the effect of probiotics of plasmid transfer and on establishment of transconjugants in the gut. Plasmid transfers were carried out in the digestive tract of germ free mice associated with an E. coli K12 donor strain harboring three plasmids (R388, self-transmissible, pCE325 and pUB2380, mobilisable,) and an E. coli recipient strain, PG1, of human origin (Duval-Iflah et al., 1994). Milks fermented with either Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus or symbiosis, S85, of both strains were given daily as 1/3 of food diet. Fermented milks have no effect on the transfer of R388 and pUB2380 except a slight increase of TC(R388) with milk fermented with S85. Long term ingestion of milk fermented with S85 inhibited the formation and the establishment of transconjugants TC(pCE325). Milk fermented with L. bulgaricus lowered the population density of TC(pCE325) in animals where they were already established. This phenomenon was reversible, since the density of TC(pCE325) increased in the same animals after cessation of supplementation. Bacterial cultures obtained in MRS broth and given in state of drinking water were compared with fermented milks. Bacterial cultures with L. bulgaricus and with S85 favoured the establishment of TC(pCE325). There results indicate for the first time that probiotics have various effects on the formation and/or establishment of transconjugants in the gut of axenic mice. The effects depend on whether the probiotics were cultivated in milk or in MRS, indicating that bacterial metabolites and viable bacteria can be involved.
TI  - Chromosome geometry and intraspecific genetic polymorphism in Gram-positive bacteria revealed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
AB  - Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) proved to be a powerful approach to study bacterial genomics. The genome structure and genetic polymorphism of Gram-positive bacteria from the high G+C (Streptomyces) and low G+C (Streptococcus) groups have been studied. PFGE allowed the estimation of the size of their genome at about 8 Mbp and 1.8 Mbp, respectively, and to get an insight into their chromosome geometry. Thus, physical mapping of the genome of wild-type Streptomyces ambofaciens strains revealed the linearity of the 8 Mbp chromosomal DNA and its typical invertron structure, while the 1.8 Mbp chromosome of Streptococcus thermophilus was shown to be circular. These findings disproved the long-standing idea of universality of bacterial chromosome circularity. In addition, strains belonging to the species S. ambofaciens and S. thermophilus allowed us to characterize the genetic polymorphism at the intraspecific level. Within the S. thermophilus species, comparison of the physical maps showed a relative conservation of gene order as well as restriction sites along the chromosome. In contrast, variable loci were characterized that revealed localized genome rearrangements. The most spectacular of these corresponded to horizontal gene transfer events of sequences. In S. ambofaciens, the physical maps of three isolates pointed to the conservation of the genetic organization. However, a strong polymorphism was observed in the terminal regions of the linear chromosomal DNA. Previous PFGE studies in S. ambofaciens gave proof of a high structural instability of a limited region of the chromosome called unstable region (i.e., DNA rearrangements such as deletions and amplifications). These intraclonal rearrangements create an impressive intraspecific polymorphism of genome size and shape (linear or circular). In both organisms, the DNA rearrangements are restricted to particular regions of the chromosome.
TI  - Molecular ecology and evolution of Streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophages--a review.
AB  - Bacteriophages attacking Streptococcus thermophilus, a lactic acid bacterium used in milk fermentation, are a threat to the dairy industry. These small isometric-headed phages possess double-stranded DNA genomes of 31 to 45 kb. Yoghurt-derived phages exhibit a limited degree of variability, as defined by restriction pattern and host range, while a large diversity of phage types have been isolated from cheese factories. Despite this diversity all S. thermophilus phages, virulent and temperate, belong to a single DNA homology group. Several mechanisms appear to create genetic variability in this phage group. Site-specific deletions, one type possibly mediated by a viral recombinase/integrase, which transformed a temperate into a virulent phage, were observed. Recombination as a result of superinfection of a lysogenic host has been reported. Comparative DNA sequencing identified up to 10% sequence diversity due to point mutations. Genome sequencing of the prototype temperate phage phi Sfi21 revealed many predicted proteins which showed homology with phages from Lactococcus lactis suggesting horizontal gene transfer. Homology with phages from evolutionary unrelated bacteria like E. coli (e.g. lambdoid phage 434 and P1) and Mycobacterium phi L5 was also found. Due to their industrial importance, the existence of large phage collections, and the whole phage genome sequencing projects which are currently underway, the S. thermophilus phages may present an interesting experimental system to study bacteriophage evolution.
TI  - Permeabilization of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus with ethanol.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus cultures were treated with ethanol and tested for viability and beta-galactosidase activity. Exposure of the biomass of test cultures to 30%-55% ethanol (vol/vol) caused a 100% loss of viability and up to 15-fold increase in measurable beta-galactosidase activity in both streptococci and lactobacilli. Ethanol-treated cell suspensions could be stored for up to 6 months without loss of enzyme activity. The nonviable permeabilized biomass of the more active S. thermophilus was used to achieve up to 80% hydrolysis of lactose in aqueous solutions and non-fat milk.
TI  - Effects of lactic acid bacteria on binding and absorption of mutagenic heterocyclic amines.
AB  - Effects of binding heterocyclic amines to cells of lactic acid bacteria on theirs absorption were investigated. Cells of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 2038 and Streptococcus thermophilus 1131 bind both 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1) and 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx). The binding of strain 1131 cells to Trp-P-1 was maximum in the pHs from 4 to 8, but strain 2038 cells bound Trp-P-1 and MeIQx only slightly at pH 7. We investigated the absorption of heterocyclic amines by the small intestine of F344 rats in the presence of these bacterial cells, using an in situ loop technique. The absorption of Trp-P-1 by the small intestine was significantly lower in the presence of strain 1131 cells than in the absence of the cells, but the presence of strain 2038 cells had no effect on Trp-P-1 absorption. Perhaps strain 1131 cells bind to Trp-P-1 at the same pH as that of the small intestine (pH 6-7) and thus decrease its absorption.
TI  - Evolution of Streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophage genomes by modular exchanges followed by point mutations and small deletions and insertions.
AB  - Comparative sequence analysis of 40% of the genomes from two prototype Streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophages (lytic group I phage phi Sfi19 and the cos site containing temperate phage phi Sfi21) suggested two processes in the evolution of their genomes. In a first evolutionarily distant phase the basic genome structure was apparently constituted by modular exchanges. Over the 17-kb-long DNA segment analyzed in the present report, we observed clusters of genes with similarity to genes from Leuconostoc oenos phage L10, Lactococcus lactis phage BK5-T, and Streptococcus pneumoniae phage Dp-1. A chimeric protein was predicted for orf 1291 which showed similarity to both phage BK5-T and phage Dp-1 proteins. The very large orf 1626 gene product showed similarity to two adjacent genes from the Lactobacillus delbrueckii phage LL-H and further phage proteins (Lactococcus lactis, Bacillus subtills). The similarities were localized to distinct parts of this apparently multifunctional protein. The putative phi Sfi19 lysin showed similarity to both lysins of phages and cellular enzymes. In a second, evolutionarily more recent, phase the S, thermophilus phage genomes apparently diversified by point mutations and small deletions/insertions. Over the investigated 17-kb DNA region phi Sfi19 differed from phi Sfi21 by 10% base pair changes, the majority of which were point mutations (mainly at the third codon position), while a third of the base pair differences were contributed by small deletions/insertions. The base pair changes were unevenly distributed. Over the Leuconostoc phage-related DNA the change rate was high, while over the Lactococcus and S. pneumoniae phage-related DNA the change rate was low. We speculate that the degree of base pair change could provide relative time scales for the modular exchange reactions observed in S. thermophilus phages.
TI  - Comparison of the lysogeny modules from the temperate Streptococcus thermophilus  bacteriophages TP-J34 and Sfi21: implications for the modular theory of phage evolution.
AB  - A 7.6-kb DNA segment covering the putative lysogeny module of the pac-site-containing temperate Streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophage TP-J34 was sequenced. Sequence alignment with the lysogeny module from the cos-site-containing S. thermophilus bacteriophage phiSfi21 revealed areas of high sequence conservation (e.g., over the int gene), interspersed with regions of low or no sequence similarity (e.g., over the cro gene). Four of the six sharp transition zones from high to low sequence conservation were found within open reading frames coding for the CI repressor, the Anti-repressor, the Immunity protein, and a protein of unknown function. The transition points in the cI and ant genes appear to separate gene segments coding for distinct functional domains of these proteins. In addition, these two transition points were located at or near the deletion sites observed in spontaneous phage phiSfi21 deletion mutants, thus suggesting these transition points as recombinational hotspots. Furthermore, the sequence at the transition point in the cI gene resembles the attachment site of the phage, suggesting the involvement of the phage integrase in at least some of the exchange reactions. Contrary to the initial formulation of the modular theory of phage evolution the unit of the evolutionary exchange in streptococcal phages is not a group of functional genes, but can be as small as a single gene. Exchange reactions can also occur within genes, possibly between gene segments encoding distinct protein domains.
TI  - Molecular characterization of a phage-inducible middle promoter and its transcriptional activator from the lactococcal bacteriophage phi31.
AB  - An inducible middle promoter from the lactococcal bacteriophage phi31 was isolated previously by shotgun cloning an 888-bp fragment (P15A10) upstream of the beta-galactosidase (beta-Gal) gene (lacZ.st) from Streptococcus thermophilus (D. J. O'Sullivan, S. A. Walker, S. G. West, and T. R. Klaenhammer, Bio/Technology 14:82-87, 1996). The promoter showed low levels of constitutive beta-Gal activity which could be induced two- to threefold over baseline levels after phage infection. During this study, the fragment was subcloned and characterized to identify a smaller, tightly regulated promoter fragment which allowed no beta-Gal activity until after phage infection. This fragment, defined within nucleotides 566 to 888 (P(566-888); also called fragment 566-888), contained tandem, phage-inducible transcription start sites at nucleotides 703 and 744 (703/744 start sites). Consensus -10 regions were present upstream of both start sites, but no consensus -35 regions were identified for either start site. A transcriptional activator, encoded by an open reading frame (ORF2) upstream of the 703/744 start sites, was identified for P(566-888). ORF2 activated P(566-888) when provided in trans in Escherichia coli. In addition, when combined with pTRK391 (P15A10::lacZ.st) in Lactococcus lactis NCK203, an antisense ORF2 construct was able to retard induction of the phage-inducible promoter as measured by beta-Gal activity levels. Finally, gel shift assays showed that ORF2 was able to bind to promoter fragment 566-888. Deletion analysis of the region upstream from the tandem promoters identified a possible binding site for transcriptional activation of the phage promoters. The DNA-binding ability of ORF2 was eliminated upon deletion of part of this region, which lies centered approximately 35 bp upstream of start site 703. Deletion analysis and mutagenesis studies also elucidated a critical region downstream of the 703/744 start sites, where mutagenesis resulted in a two- to threefold increase in beta-Gal activity. With these improvements, the level of expression achieved by an explosive-expression strategy was elevated from 3,000 to 11,000 beta-Gal units within 120 min after induction.
TI  - Identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  - We have used a PCR assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (sodA(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (S. acidominimus, S. agalactiae, S. alactolyticus, S. anginosus, S. bovis, S. constellatus, S. canis, S. cricetus, S. downei, S. dysgalactiae, S. equi subsp. equi, S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, S. equinus, S. gordonii, S. iniae, S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. parasanguis, S. pneumoniae, S. porcinus, S. pyogenes, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. sobrinus, S. suis, S. thermophilus, and S. vestibularis). Phylogenetic analysis of these sodA(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16S rRNA sequences. We have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their sodA(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the sodA(int) fragments of the type species. We propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.
TI  - Manufacture and quality of iron-fortified yogurt.
AB  - Yogurts (nonfat and low fat) were manufactured and fortified with 10, 20, and 40  mg of iron/kg of yogurt. Growth of starter culture bacteria and nonstarter culture bacteria as well as lipid oxidation of the yogurts were monitored over 30 d of storage at 4 degrees C. Sensory characteristics of the yogurts were determined during that time by a trained panel of judges, and consumer panels were used to test acceptability of iron-fortified yogurt. Counts of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricas and Streptococcus thermophilus after 1 d of storage in iron-fortified skim yogurts were 7.0 x 10(8) cfu/ml, which were not significantly different from numbers in unfortified yogurts. Counts decreased to 2.5 x 10(8) and 1.9 x 10(8) cfu/ml for L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus, respectively, after 30 d of storage. Fortifying yogurt with iron did not support the growth of Pseudomonas fluorescens or Escherichia coli. No significant increases in chemical oxidation, as measured using the thiobarbituric acid assay, were detected as a consequence of iron fortification. Trained panelists scored all yogurts for oxidized, metallic, bitter, and other off-flavors in the range of "not perceptible" to "very slightly perceptible". Iron-fortified yogurts had slightly higher oxidized flavor scores than did the control yogurt. There was no increase in metallic, bitter, or other off-flavors. The consumer panel did not detect any significant differences in the appearance, mouthfeel, flavor, or overall quality between fortified and unfortified flavored yogurts. All yogurt samples were liked by the consumer panelists, suggesting that yogurt is a suitable vehicle for iron fortification.
TI  - Influence of yogurt and acidophilus yogurt on serum cholesterol levels in mice.
AB  - The effects of yogurt and acidophilus yogurt on the weight gain, serum cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and the numbers of fecal lactobacilli and coliforms were investigated in mice assigned to three dietary treatments for 56 d: 1) commercial rodent chow and water (control), 2) commercial rodent chow and yogurt made from milk inoculated with a 3% (vol/vol) liquid culture of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (yogurt), and 3) commercial rodent chow plus yogurt made from milk inoculated with a 0.01% (wt/vol) freeze-dried culture of Streptococcus thermophilus plus Lactobacillus acidophilus. The weight gains of mice receiving yogurt or acidophilus yogurt were higher than those of the mice in the control group. The mean values for serum cholesterol concentrations and LDL cholesterol concentrations were significantly decreased when acidophilus yogurt was fed on d 28 and 56. High density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides were not affected by yogurt or acidophilus yogurt. The highest number of fecal lactobacilli was found in mice receiving acidophilus yogurt, and the number of fecal coliforms of that group was also lower than in the other two groups.
TI  - Sequence analysis and characterization of phi O1205, a temperate bacteriophage infecting Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ1205.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence of phi O1205, a temperate bacteriophage infecting Streptococcus thermophilus strain CNRZ1205, was determined. The phage genome has a unit length of 43,075 bp and appears to be packaged by the so-called headful mechanism. The genomic organization and structure of phi O1205 resemble those of several temperate lactococcal phages that display a life-cycle-specific organization, where ORFs believed to be involved in the lysogenic life-cycle are clustered and arranged in an orientation opposite to the ORFs supposedly involved in the lytic life-cycle. Database searches revealed putative functions for several identified ORFs and further indicated that phi O1205 is genetically related to a particular group of lactococcal phages. Three genes encoding the major structural proteins were identified on the phi O1205 genome. The phage attachment site attP, the bacterial attachment site attB, and the two phage/chromosome junctions attL and attR were identified and found to contain a 40 bp common core sequence.
TI  - Application of the extracellular alpha-amylase gene from Streptococcus bovis 148  to construction of a secretion vector for yogurt starter strains.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus ATCC 19258, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus T-11, and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis IL1403 were transformed with the alpha-amylase gene (amyA) from Streptococcus bovis 148 by using a wide host-range vector, and all the transformants secreted the alpha-amylase successfully. Since the promoter and the secretion signal of the amyA gene were functional in these strains, we constructed a secretion vector using the expression elements of amyA. Trials to secrete foreign enzymes in yogurt starter strains were performed using this novel secretion vector.
TI  - The association of yogurt starters with Lactobacillus casei DN 114.001 in fermented milk alters the composition and metabolism of intestinal microflora in germ-free rats and in human flora-associated rats.
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the effects of milk and of various fermented milks on the composition and metabolic activities of the intestinal microflora. Groups of eight rats were fed for 6 wk a diet containing 30% nonfermented milk (M), yogurt (Y), milk fermented with Lactobacillus casei (LcFM) or milk fermented with the association of L. casei DN 114.001 and yogurt starters (LcYFM). In the first study, the survival of the lactic acid bacteria from the fermented milks was assessed by bacterial enumeration in feces of germ-free rats (GF rats) fed milk or fermented milks. The metabolic activities of the lactic acid bacteria were studied in these rats by the measurement of glycolytic activities and products of bacterial fermentation, i.e., acetate and lactate (isoforms L and D). In a second study, the effects of fermented milks on the composition and metabolism [gas, glycolytic activities, short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), alcohol and ammonia] of human flora were studied using human flora-associated rats (HF rats). In GF rats, the survival of L. casei in the feces did not differ between those fed the LcFM and LcYFM diets. L. bulgaricus was detected in the feces of the rats fed Y, whereas Streptoccus thermophilus was found in the feces of the LcYFM group. In HF rats, fecal concentration of Bifidobacteria was greater in the LcFM group than in the others. beta-Glucuronidase (EC 3.2.1.31) activity was lower in rats fed LcFM and Y than in those fed M and LcYFM, whereas beta-galactosidase (3.2.1.23), alpha-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1 20) and beta-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21) activities were higher in the LcYFM group compared with the others. Methane excretion was higher in rats fed Y than in other groups. Cecal SCFA concentrations did not differ in LcFM, Y and M groups, but total SCFA, acetate, propionate and butyrate were significantly greater in the LcYFM group. These results suggest that milk fermented with the combination of L. casei and yogurt starters leads to specific effects that are different from the simple addition of the effects found with yogurt and milk fermented with L. casei. These specific effects are potentially beneficial to human health.
TI  - The site-specific integration system of the temperate Streptococcus thermophilus  bacteriophage phiSfi21.
AB  - The temperate bacteriophage phiSfi21 integrates its DNA into the chromosome of Streptococcus thermophilus strains via site-specific recombination. Nucleotide sequencing of the attachment sites identified a 40-bp identity region which surprisingly overlaps both the 18-terminal bp of the phage integrase gene and the 11-terminal bp of a host tRNAArg gene. A 2.4-kb phage DNA segment, covering attP, the phage integrase, and a likely immunity gene contained all the genetic information for faithful integration of a nonreplicative plasmid into the attB site. A deletion within the int gene led to the loss of integration proficiency. A number of spontaneous deletions were observed in plasmids containing the 2.4-kb phage DNA segment. The deletion sites were localized to the tRNA side of the identity region and to phage or vector DNA with 3- to 6-bp-long repeats from the border region. A similar type of deletion was previously observed in a spontaneous phage mutant.
TI  - Streptococcus thermophilus and its biosurfactants inhibit adhesion by Candida spp. on silicone rubber.
AB  - The adhesion of yeasts, two Candida albicans and two Candida tropicalis strains isolated from naturally colonized voice prostheses, to silicone rubber with and without a salivary conditioning film in the absence and presence of adhering Streptococcus thermophilus B, a biosurfactant-releasing dairy isolate, was studied. Coverage of 1 to 4% of the surface of silicone rubber substrata with adhering S. thermophilus B gave significant reductions in the initial yeast adhesion regardless of the presence of a conditioning film. Mechanistically, this interference in yeast adhesion by S. thermophilus B was not due to direct physical effects but to biosurfactant release by the adhering bacteria, because experiments with S. thermophilus B cells that had released their biosurfactants prior to adhesion to silicone rubber and competition with yeasts did not show interference with initial yeast adhesion. The amounts of biosurfactants released were highest for mid-exponential- and early-stationary-phase bacteria (37 mg.g of cells-1 [dry weight]), but biosurfactants released by stationary-phase bacteria (14 mg.g of cells-1 [dry weight]) were the most surface active. The crude biosurfactants released were mixtures of various components, with a glycolipid-like component being the most surface active. A lipid-enriched biosurfactant fraction reduced the surface tension of an aqueous solution to about 35 mJ.m-2 at a concentration of only 0.5 mg.ml-1. The amount of biosurfactant released per S. thermophilus B cell was estimated to be sufficient to cover approximately 12 times the area of the cross section of the bacterium, making biosurfactant release a powerful defense weapon in the postadhesion competition of the bacterium with microorganisms such as yeasts. Preadsorption of biosurfactants to the silicone rubber prior to allowing yeasts to adhere was as effective against C. albicans GB 1/2 adhesion as covering 1 to 2% of the silicone rubber surface with adhering S. thermophilus B, but a preadsorbed biosurfactant layer was less effective against C. tropicalis GB 9/9.
TI  - Characterization of superoxide dismutase in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus AO54 possesses a single manganese-containing superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). The enzyme was found to be insensitive to cyanide or to a modified H2O2 treatment. The enzyme is expressed in a growth-phase-dependent fashion, increasing three- to fourfold upon entry into stationary phase. The specific activity for MnSOD was the same under anaerobic or aerobic conditions and was not induced by the presence of paraquat under aerobic conditions.
TI  - Structural characterization of the exocellular polysaccharides produced by Streptococcus thermophilus SFi39 and SFi12.
AB  - We investigated the structures of the exopolysaccharides (EPSs) produced by Streptococcus thermophilus SFi39 and SFi12. Both polymers were found to have molecular masses of greater than 2 x 10(6) Da. The SFi39 EPS consisted of D-glucose and D-galactose in a molar ratio of 1:1, whereas the SFi12 EPS was composed of D-galactose, L-rhamnose, and D-glucose in a molar ratio of 3:2:1. Methylation analysis of and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra recorded from the native polysaccharide, as well as oligosaccharides released by partial acid hydrolysis, allowed the complete structural determination of the SFi39 EPS, which consists of the following tetrasaccharide repeating unit: [formula: see text] Similar spectra recorded only from the native polysaccharide were sufficient to allow the structural determination of the SFi12 EPS, which consists of the following hexasaccharide repeating unit: [formula: see text] This study shows that the texturizing properties of different S. thermophilus ropy strains are based on the production of EPSs exhibiting chemical similarities but structural differences.
TI  - STP2201, a chromosomal promoter sequence of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Analysis of the structural and functional properties of chromosomal DNA fragments of Streptococcus thermophilus ST128 delineated the promoter sequence STP2201 and identified its -35, -10 and Shine-Dalgarno regions. STP2201 was used in cloning vectors derived from small resident plasmids pER8 (2094 bp) and pER371 (2672 bp) of S. thermophilus strains to facilitate expression of a Streptomyces sp. marker gene (cholesterol oxidase) in lactic acid bacteria. Cell extracts of ST128 transformants converted up to 75% of cholesterol into 4-cholesten-3-one during 8 h of incubation.
TI  - Sth132I, a novel class-IIS restriction endonuclease of Streptococcus thermophilus ST132.
AB  - The Sth132I restriction endonuclease (R.Sth132I) was detected in Streptococcus thermophilus ST132 and purified to near homogeneity by heparin Sepharose CL-6B affinity chromatography. Fragments from Sth132I digestion of plasmid DNA were subcloned into pUC19 in Escherichia coli DH5alpha and sequenced. Sequence analysis of inserts and their ligation junction sites revealed that Sth132I is a novel class-IIS restriction endonuclease, which recognizes the non-palindromic sequence 5'-CCCG(N)4-3', 3'-GGGC(N) 8-5'.
TI  - A highly conserved DNA replication module from Streptococcus thermophilus phages  is similar in sequence and topology to a module from Lactococcus lactis phages.
AB  - A highly conserved DNA region extending over 5 kb was observed in Streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophages. Comparative sequencing of one temperate and 26 virulent phages demonstrated in the most extreme case an 18% aa difference for a predicted protein, while the majority of the phages showed fewer, if any aa changes. The relative degree of aa conservation was not homogeneous over the DNA segment investigated. Sequence analysis of the conserved segment revealed genes possibly involved in DNA transactions. Three predicted proteins (orf 233, 443, and 382 gene product (gp)) showed nucleoside triphosphate binding motifs. Orf 443 gp showed in addition a DEAH box motif, characteristically found in a subgroup of helicases, and a variant zinc finger motif known from a phage T7 helicase/primase. Tree analysis classified orf 443 gp as a distant member of the helicase superfamily. Orf 382 gp showed similarity to putative plasmid DNA primases. Downstream of orf 382 a noncoding repeat region was identified that showed similarity to a putative minus origin from a cryptic S. thermophilus plasmid. Four predicted proteins showed not only high degrees of aa identity (34 to 63%) with proteins from Lactococcus lactis phages, but their genes showed a similar topological organization. We interpret this as evidence for a horizontal gene transfer event between phages of the two bacterial genera in the distant past.
TI  - Two groups of bacteriophages infecting Streptococcus thermophilus can be distinguished on the basis of mode of packaging and genetic determinants for major structural proteins.
AB  - A comparative study of 30 phages of Streptococcus thermophilus was performed based on DNA restriction profiles, DNA homology, structural proteins, packaging mechanisms, and host range data. All phages exhibited distinct DNA restriction profiles, with some phages displaying similarly sized restriction fragments. DNA homology was shown to be present among all 30 phages. The phages could be divided into two groups on the basis of their packaging mechanism as was derived from the appearance of submolar DNA fragments in restriction enzyme digests and the presence (cos-containing phages) or absence (pac-containing phages) of cohesive genomic extremities. Interestingly, the 19 identified cos-containing phages possessed two major structural proteins (32 and 26 kDa) in contrast to the remaining 11 pac-containing phages, which possessed three major structural proteins (41, 25, and 13 kDa). Southern hybridization demonstrated that all pac-containing phages tested contain homologs of the genes encoding the three major structural proteins of the pac-containing phage O1205, whereas all cos-containing phages tested exhibit homology to the gene specifying one of the structural components of the cos-containing phage phi 7201. Fifty-seven percent of the phages (both cos and pac containing) possessed the previously identified 2.2-kb EcoRI fragment of the temperate S. thermophilus phage Sfi18 (H. Brussow, A. Probst, M. Fremont, and J. Sidoti, Virology 200:854-857, 1994). No obvious correlation was detected between grouping based on packaging mechanism and host range data obtained with 39 industrial S. thermophilus strains.
TI  - Molecular ecology of Streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophage infections in a cheese factory.
AB  - A mozzarella cheese factory using an undefined, milk-derived Streptococcus thermophilus starter system was monitored longitudinally for 2 years to determine whether the diversity of the resident bacteriophage population arose from environmental sources or from genetic changes in the resident phage in the factory. The two hypotheses led to different predictions about the genetic diversity of the phages. With respect to host range, 12 distinct phage types were observed. With two exceptions, phages belonging to different lytic groups showed clearly distinct restriction patterns and multiple isolates of phages showing the same host range exhibited identical or highly related restriction patterns. Sequencing studies in a conserved region of the phage genome revealed no point mutations in multiple isolates of the same phage type, while up to 12% nucleotide sequence diversity was observed between the different phage types. This diversity is as large as that between the most different sequences from phages in our collection. These observations make unlikely a model that postulates a single phage invasion event and diversification of the phage during its residence in the factory. In the second stage of our factory study, a defined starter system was introduced that could not propagate the resident factory phage population. Within a week, three new phage types were observed in the factory while the resident phage population was decreased but not eliminated. Raw milk was the most likely source of these new phages, as phages with identical host ranges and restriction patterns were isolated from raw milk delivered to the factory during the intervention trial. Apparently, all of the genetic diversity observed in the S. thermophilus phages isolated during our survey was already created in their natural environment. A better understanding of the raw-milk ecology of S. thermophilus phages is thus essential for successful practical phage control.
TI  - Influence of charge differences in the C-terminal part of nisin on antimicrobial  activity and signaling capacity.
AB  - Three mutants of the antibiotic nisin Z, in which the Val32 residue was replaced  by a Glu, Lys or Trp residue, were produced and characterized for the purpose of establishing the role of charge differences in the C-terminal part of nisin on antimicrobial activity and signaling properties. 1H-NMR analyses showed that all three mutants harbor an unmodified serine residue at position 33, instead of the usual dehydroalanine. Apparently, the nature of the residue preceding the serine to be dehydrated, strongly affects the efficiency of modification. Cleavage of [Glu32,Ser33]nisin Z by endoproteinase Glu-C yielded [Glu32]nisin Z(1-32)-peptide, which has a net charge difference of -2 relative to wild-type nisin Z. The activity of [Lys32,Ser33]nisin Z against Micrococcus flavus was similar to that of wild-type nisin, while [Trp32,Ser33]nisin Z, [Glu32,Ser33]nisin Z and [Glu32]nisin Z(1-32)-peptide exhibited 3-5-fold reduced activity, indicating that negative charges in the C-terminal part of nisin Z are detrimental for activity. All variants showed significant loss of activity against Streptococcus thermophilus. The potency of the nisin variants to act as signaling molecules for auto-induction of biosynthesis was significantly reduced. To obtain mutant production, extracellular addition of (mutant) nisin Z to the lactococcal expression strains was essential.
TI  - Identification of a cold shock gene in lactic acid bacteria and the effect of cold shock on cryotolerance.
AB  - When Lactic Acid Bacterial cultures were frozen at -20 degrees C for 24 h, the cell viability decreased drastically, but when they were cold shocked at 10 degrees C for 2 h prior to freezing, viability improved significantly for the Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis strains (25-37%) and Pediococcus pentosaceus PO2 (18%), but not for the Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris strains tested or for one strain of Lactobacillus helveticus LB1 and Streptococcus thermophilus TS2. When the period for cold shock was extended to 5 h, the viability increased even further for those strains that displayed cold shock cryotolerance. Use of degenerate PCR primers based on the major cold shock protein (csp) of both Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis resulted in PCR products from all strains tested. The PCR product from Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis M474 was cloned and sequenced, and the deduced amino acid sequence displayed a high sequence similarity to other csp's. Use of PCR primers based on the M474 sequence resulted in PCR products being produced only from the lactococcal strains studied and not from the Lactobacillus helveticus, Streptococcus thermophilus, or Pediococcus pentosaceus strains tested.
TI  - Characterization of the lysogeny DNA module from the temperate Streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophage phi Sfi21.
AB  - Phage phi Sfi21, the only temperate Streptococcus thermophilus phage from our phage collection, showed extensive DNA homology with virulent phages from lytic group I. Southern blot hybridizations demonstrated that the phi Sfi21-specific DNA was clustered in an approximately 6.6-kb-long region, the putative lysogeny module. Sequence analysis and database research identified an integrase within this module; orf 203 with homology to an anonymous orf 258 from the temperate lactococcal phage BK5-T; orf 127 and orf 122 with weak homology to the N- and C-terminal parts, respectively, of the cl-like repressor from lactococcal phages Tuc2009 and BK5-T; orf 75 with homology to a repressor protein from lambdoid phage 434 and an anti-repressor ant with homology to phage P1. The molecular arrangement of the predicted orfs in phage phi Sfi21 was very similar to that of the lactococcal phage BK5-T. The transition from phi Sfi21-specific DNA into DNA shared with virulent phages was abrupt and flanked at one side by notable DNA repeats. Sequence analysis identified a holin protein to the left of the lysogeny module. A site-specific deletion of 2.4 kb, which reproducibly transformed phi Sfi21 into a lytic phage, was localized in the lysogeny module. It was flanked at both sides by conspicuous DNA repeats. One repeat region reflected the DNA around the attP site, while the other reflected the putative genetic switch region between repressor and anti-repressor genes. S. thermophilus host Sfi1 transformed with a plasmid containing int and orf 203 showed resistance to superinfection by heterologous phages, but not by the homologous phi Sfi21. Part of the int gene could be deleted without loss of this activity, while a deletion in orf 203 resulted in loss of the phage resistance. We speculate on the possibility of a bipartite immunity system for the control of lysogeny in phi Sfi21.
TI  - Structural characterisation of the exocellular polysaccharide produced by Streptococcus thermophilus OR 901.
AB  - The exocellular polysaccharide of Streptococcus thermophilus OR 901, isolated from partially deproteinised whey, is a heteropolymer of D-galactopyranose and L-rhamnopyranose residues in the molar ratio 5:2. The structure was established by methylation analysis and 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy of the native polysaccharide, in combination with characterisation of oligosaccharide fragments, obtained by partial acid hydrolysis, using methylation analysis and 1D 1H NMR spectroscopy. The polysaccharide has a branched heptasaccharide repeating unit with the following structure: [sequence: see text]
TI  - Presence of additional peptidases in Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ 302 compared to Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus is widely used in the dairy industry but little is known about its peptidase system. The aim of this study was to determine the biochemical and genetic characteristics of this system, and to compare it to the well known system of Lactococcus lactis. We separated the intracellular proteins of Strep. thermophilus CNRZ 302 and L. lactis NCDO 763 by ion-exchange chromatography and we detected the activity of the different types of peptidases. In both L. lactis and Strep. thermophilus strains, we showed 13 different peptidase activities with biochemical homologies between both species. Streptococcus thermophilus also possessed two peptidases which we did not find in L. lactis: an aminopeptidase and an oligopeptidase. We performed Southern blot experiments and among the eight peptidase genes tested, only the genes encoding the general aminopeptidases, pepC and pepN, were homologous between the L. lactis and Strep. thermophilus strains. Besides biochemical and genetic similarities, the peptidase systems of Strep. thermophilus and L. lactis thus differed by the presence of additional peptidases in Strep. thermophilus.
TI  - Survival of lactic acid bacteria in a dynamic model of the stomach and small intestine: validation and the effects of bile.
AB  - This study was conducted to validate a dynamic model of the stomach and small intestine to quantify the survival of lactic acid bacteria and to assess the influence of gastrointestinal secretions. The survival of a single strain of each of the following species, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, and Streptococcus thermophilus, was measured under physiological conditions (e.g., peristalsis, changes in pH, and changes in concentrations of enzymes and bile) and were compared with data obtained from humans. No significant differences were found between the in vitro and in vivo data, indicating that the model has a predictive value for the survival of these bacteria in humans. The survival of these strains of lactic acid bacteria in the gastrointestinal model was investigated under two different conditions in the small intestine: simulation of physiological secretion of bile and low bile secretion. Reductions in viability were significantly different between the bacterial species. The dose-response effect of bile on the survival of the tested bacteria was significant, demonstrating the bactericidal effect of bile salts. This study demonstrates the differences among bacterial species in their sensitivity to gastric and intestinal secretions.
TI  - Cloning, sequence, and expression of the L-(+) lactate dehydrogenase of Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - The ldh gene encoding the fructose-1,6-diphosphate-dependent L-(+) lactate dehydrogenase from the ruminal bacterium Streptococcus bovis was cloned and sequenced. A genomic library of S. bovis JB1 DNA was constructed in lambda ZAP II and screened by use of a heterologous probe derived from the cloned Streptococcus mutans ldh gene. Several clones were isolated that contained a common 2.9-kb fragment as determined by restriction analysis. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a 987-bp open reading frame with extensive homology to Streptococcus thermophilus and S. mutans ldh nucleic acid and amino acid sequences. Expression of the cloned S. bovis ldh gene in Escherichia coli was confirmed by the ability to complement the ldh mutation of E. coli FMJ39, by using an in-gel activity screen and by enzymatic assay. Increased LDH activity was observed in S. bovis JB1 containing the cloned ldh genes on a multicopy plasmid.
TI  - Thermophilin 13, a nontypical antilisterial poration complex bacteriocin, that functions without a receptor.
AB  - A novel broad host range antimicrobial substance, Thermophilin 13, has been isolated and purified from the growth medium of Streptococcus thermophilus. Thermophilin 13 is composed of the antibacterial peptide ThmA (Mr of 5776) and the enhancing factor ThmB (Mr of 3910); the latter peptide increased the activity of ThmA approximately 40 x. Both peptides are encoded by a single operon, and an equimolar ratio was optimal for Thermophilin 13 activity. Despite the antilisterial activity of Thermophilin 13, neither ThmA nor ThmB contain the YGNGV-C consensus sequence of Listeria-active peptides, and post-translational modifications comparable to that in the lantibiotics are also absent. Mass spectrometry did reveal the apparent oxidation of methionines in ThmA, which resulted in a peptide that could not be enhanced any longer by ThmB, whereas the intrinsic bactericidal activity was normal. Thermophilin 13 dissipated the membrane potential and the pH gradient in liposomes, and this activity was independent of membrane components from a sensitive strain (e.g. lipid or proteinaceous receptor). Models of possible poration complexes formed are proposed on the basis of sequence comparisons, structure predictions, and the functional analysis of Thermophilin 13.
TI  - Survival of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in yoghurt during preparation and storage at 4 degrees C.
AB  - Cow's milk was inoculated with ca 10(3) and 10(7) cfu ml-1 Escherichia coli O157:H7. After fermentation at 42 degrees C for 0-5 h, the yoghurt was stored at 4 degrees C. Two kinds of yoghurt were used: traditional yoghurt (TY), made with Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus starter cultures, and 'bifido' yoghurt (BY), made with the two starter cultures plus Bifidobacterium bifidum. After 7 d E. coli O157:H7 decreased from 3.52 to 2.72 log10 cfu ml-1 and from 7.08 to 5.32 log10 cfu ml-1 in TY, and from 3.49 to 2.73 log10 cfu ml-1 and from 7.38 to 5.41 log10 cfu ml-1 in BY. The pH values of yoghurt dropped from 6.6 to 4.5 and 4.4 in TY (for low and high pathogen inocula, respectively), and from 6.6 to 4.6 and 4.5 in BY (for low and high pathogen inocula, respectively).
TI  - A 16 kDa protein family overexpressed by Streptococcus thermophilus PB18 in acid  environments.
AB  - The one- and two-dimensional protein patterns of Streptococcus thermophilus PB18  in the exponential and stationary phases of growth were analysed. One-dimensional SDS-PAGE showed that a 16 kDa protein was overexpressed in stationary phase as well as 2 h after an acid shock, and that it was not expressed when the bacteria reached the stationary phase in medium with limiting lactose concentrations (5 or 10 g l-1), in which the pH (5.5) was not as acid as in control cultures (pH 4.7, lactose 20 g l-1). The results support the idea that this protein is expressed in response to the acidic environment and not in response to the growth phase. Two-dimensional PAGE showed that nine proteins were expressed only during the exponential phase and ten others only during the stationary phase. The 16 kDa band seen in one-dimensional SDS-PAGE corresponded to a 16 kDa protein family observed on two-dimensional SDS-PAGE/IEF gels, whose expression was increased 8.5-fold when the extracellular pH reached a critical value below 5.0. The N-terminal sequences of proteins from two spots on the two-dimensional gels (members of the 16 kDa family) were determined and found to be identical. The physiological role of this protein family has not yet been elucidated.
TI  - Cell wall anchoring of the Streptococcus pyogenes M6 protein in various lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The M6 protein from Streptococcus pyogenes is the best-characterized member of a  family of cell envelope-associated proteins. Based on the observation that the C-terminal sorting signals of these proteins can drive cell wall anchoring of heterologous unanchored proteins, we have cloned and expressed the emm6 structural gene for the M6 protein in various lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The emm6 gene was successfully expressed from lactococcal promoters in several Lactococcus lactis strains, an animal-colonizing Lactobacillus fermentum strain, Lactobacillus sake, and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. The M6 protein was efficiently anchored to the cell wall in all strains tested. In lactobacilli, essentially all detectable M6 protein was cell wall associated. These results suggest the feasibility of using the C-terminal anchor moiety of M6 for protein surface display in LAB.
TI  - Pharmaceutical probiotics for the treatment of anaerobic and other infections.
AB  - Pharmaceutical probiotics have been used as alternative treatments or preventative therapies for a variety of clinical diseases. The overuse of antibiotics and emergence of multiple-antibiotic resistant pathogens has refocused clinical attention on the field of probiotics. Anaerobic infections which seem to respond well to probiotics are infections which involve the disruption of normal microbial flora. Gastrointestinal infections (travelers' diarrhea, antibiotic-associated diarrhea,Clostridium difficile disease, rotavirus diarrhea) have been studied using the following pharmaceutical probiotics:Saccharomyces boulardii, Lactobacillus casei GG, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Streptococcus thermophilus and Enterococcus faecium. Vaginitis has been experimentally studied using L. acidophilus and L. casei GG. The efficacy, safety and mechanisms of action of these various probiotics are reviewed. Requirements for drug approval are similar for biologic probiotics and new drug entities and these requirements involve preclinical tolerability studies, pharmacokinetic studies and large, well-controlled blinded clinical trials.
TI  - Analysis of the genetic polymorphism between three Streptococcus thermophilus strains by comparing their physical and genetic organization.
AB  - The physical maps of Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ368 and NST2280 strains were  constructed by analysing PFGE patterns obtained with the low-frequency-cutting enzymes SmaI, BssHII and SfiI. Their chromosomes are 1864 and 1840 kb circular molecules, respectively. Comparison of their physical maps with that of the reference A054 strain revealed a relatively conserved organization of the restriction sites. Three variable regions were detected with the map of CNRZ368 whereas 15 were found with the map of NST2280. To construct the genetic maps, probes corresponding to 10 single-copy genes, the rrn genes and the insertion sequences IS1191, IS981 and ISS1 were hybridized to Southern blots of chromosomal DNA digested with the different mapping enzymes. Comparison of the genetic maps of the three strains showed a conserved location of the mapped single-copy genes. However, six rrn loci were present in the chromosome of A054 and CNRZ368 whereas five were present in the NST2280 chromosome. A polymorphism was also found in the copy number of the insertion sequences between the three strains.
TI  - Characterization of a thiol-dependent endopeptidase from Lactobacillus helveticus CNRZ32.
AB  - An endopeptidase gene (pepE) was isolated from a previously constructed genomic library of Lactobacillus helveticus CNRZ32. The pepE gene consisted of a 1,314-bp open reading frame encoding a putative peptide of 52.1 kDa. Significant identity was found between the deduced amino acid sequence of pepE and the sequences for aminopeptidase C from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis DSM7290, L. helveticus CNRZ32, Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ302, and Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris AM2. A recombinant PepE fusion protein containing an N-terminal six-histidine tag was constructed and purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. Characterization of PepE revealed that it was a thiol-dependent protease having a monomeric mass of 50 kDa, with optimum temperature, NaCl concentration, and pH for activity at 32 to 37 degrees C, 0.5%, and 4.5, respectively. PepE had significant activity under conditions which simulate those of ripening cheese (10 degrees C, 4% NaCl, pH 5.1). PepE hydrolyzed internal peptide bonds in Met-enkephalin and bradykinin; however, hydrolysis of alpha-, beta-, and kappa-caseins was not detected.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of transcription signal sequences from Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus (ST) chromosomal DNA fragments generated by partial Sau3A digestion were cloned into the unique BamHI site upstream from the promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) gene of the Escherichia coli (EC)promoter-probe vector pKK520-3. Recombinant plasmids containing ST sequences with transcription-activation activity were isolated from chloramphenicol-resistant (CmR) EC transformants. A promoterless Streptomyces antibioticus melanin biosynthesis operon (melC) was inserted immediately downstream from the ST sequence to identify DNA with strong promoter activity. Several ST transcription-activation sequences, termed STPs, were isolated and subcloned, and their nucleic acid sequences determined. The -10 and -35 consensus sequences were identified in these putative ST promoters. Detailed analysis of STP3306 sequence data revealed two partial open reading frames (ORFs) with high degrees of homology to prokaryotic GTP-binding protein and DNA repair enzyme, thus providing valuable information for further study on DNA maintenance in this important lactic acid bacterium.
TI  - Development of oligonucleotide primers from the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic sequences for identifying different dairy and probiotic lactic acid bacteria by PCR.
AB  - Spacer regions between the 16S and 23S rRNA genes of different dairy and probiotic lactic acid bacteria were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with conserved primers and the nucleotide sequences of these spacer regions were determined. Amplification/oligonucleotide primer pairs were designed for Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus and Streptococcus thermophilus based on the differences in the nucleotide sequences of the 16S-23S rRNA spacer regions. Also a primer pair identifying both Lb. paracasei and Lb. rhamnosus was designed. In addition to conventional PCR in a heat block a rapid PCR method in an Air Thermocycler (ATC) with glass capillaries was used.
TI  - Primary and secondary structures of rRNA spacer regions in enterococci.
AB  - The 16S-23S and 23S-5S rRNA spacer DNA regions (spacer regions 1 and 2, respectively) from Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus durans and Enterococcus mundtii were amplified by PCR. Their nucleotide sequences were established and a secondary structure model showing the interaction between the two spacer regions was built. Whereas lactococci and Streptococcus sensu stricto are characterized by a single type of spacer region 1, the enterococci show a high degree of variability in this region; thus the spacer regions 1 with and without tRNA(Ala) were characterized. However, as shown for lactococci and Streptococcus sensu stricto, the tRNA(Ala) gene does not encode the 3'-terminal CCA trinucleotide. A putative antitermination signal is found downstream from the tRNA(Ala) gene. Based on comparison with Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus, a double-stranded processing stem is proposed. In E, hirae, one of the three different types of spacer region 1 contains no tRNA(Ala), but displays a 107 nt insertion that forms a long stem-loop structure. A similar insertion (115 nt in length) was found in E. faecium and base compensatory mutations preserve the ability to form the long stem-loop structure. Such insertions may correspond to mobile intervening sequences, as found in the 23S rRNA coding sequences of some Gram-negative bacteria. The spacer regions 1 and 2 from the three subgroups of streptococci were compared, and except for the tRNA(Ala) gene and the double-stranded processing sites, little similarity was found, which opens large possibilities for future development of DNA-based typing methods.
TI  - Impact of dietary yogurt on immune function.
AB  - Studies of the effects of yogurt on immunity and atopic diseases have suggested improvements in cytokine (interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma) responses and clinical scores in patients with allergic rhinitis. This study compares prospectively immune parameters of participants who received 16 oz of yogurt versus 16 oz of milk/day in a randomized cross-over design. Yogurt that contained live, active Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus or 2% milk was consumed for one month each. Twenty otherwise healthy adults with atopic histories documented by skin testing were enrolled. Immune studies were performed at the beginning and end of the two 1-month study phases, separated by a 2-week washout period. These studies included measurements of cellular, humoral, and phagocytic function. No adverse events were noted in either group. No significant improvements in any immune parameter were noted. The consumption of yogurt that contained the live active bacteria L bulgaricus and S thermophilus does not appear to enhance immune function in atopic individuals at the dosage and duration used in this study.
TI  - Analysis of the icsBA locus required for biosynthesis of the inner core region from Neisseria meningitidis lipopolysaccharide.
AB  - By deletion mutagenesis in the entire meningococcal chromosome, we have previously identified the icsA gene, which encodes the glycosyltransferase required for adding GlcNAc to Hep-II in the inner core of meningococcal LPS. This gene has homology to several LPS glycosyltransferases, notably to rfaK from Salmonella typhimurium and bplH from Bordetella pertussis, both of which encode GlcNAc transferases. Directly upstream of icsA is an ORF showing significant homology to the hypothetical protein HI0653 from the Haemophilus influenzae genome sequence, and to a lesser degree to putative glycosyltransferases from Streptococcus thermophilus and Yersinia enterocolitica. Insertional inactivation of this ORF resulted in a meningococcal strain with truncated LPS. We have named this new LPS-involved gene icsB. Differences in binding of monoclonal antibodies and in mobility on Tricine-SDS-PAGE showed that LPS from icsA and icsB mutants is similar but not identical. On the basis of these results, we postulated that the new gene encodes the glycosyltransferase required for adding Glc to Hep-I. Structural analysis of purified mutant LPS by electrospray mass spectrometry was used to verify this hypothesis. The composition determined for icsA and icsB is lipidA-(KDO)2-(Hep)2.PEA and lipidA-(KDO)2-(Hep)2.PEA-GlcNAc, respectively. The icsA and icsB genes thus form an operon encoding the glycosyltransferases required for chain elongation from the lipidA-(KDO)2-(Hep)2 basal structure, with IcsA first adding GlcNAc to Hep-II and IcsB subsequently adding Glc to Hep-I. Only then is completion of the lacto-N-neotetraose structure possible through the action of the IgtA-E genes.
TI  - Purification and characterisation of an intracellular X-prolyl-dipeptidyl aminopeptidase from Streptococcus thermophilus ACA-DC 4.
AB  - An intracellular X-prolyl-dipeptidyl aminopeptidase from Streptococcus thermophilus ACA-DC 4, isolated from traditional Greek yoghurt, was purified by anion exchange and gel filtration chromatography. A single band of molecular weight of about 80,000 appeared in SDS-PAGE; by gel filtration it was shown that the native enzyme was dimeric. The peptidase showed optimum activity on glycyl-prolyl 4-nitroanilide at pH 7.0 and at 50 degrees C, with K(m) = 3.1 mM and Vmax = 3500 U mg-1; over 50 degrees C the enzyme activity declined rapidly. It was inactivated by PMSF; sulfhydryl group reagents and metal chelators had little effect on enzyme activity.
TI  - Natural milk cultures for the production of Argentinian cheeses.
AB  - Samples (32) of natural milk cultures used in the Santa Fe, Argentina, area for soft and semihard cheese production were examined. The microbial composition (including lactic acid microflora characterization) and technological parameters (acidifying and proteolytic activities) were evaluated. The cultures contained mainly thermophilic lactic acid bacteria, identified as Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus (96.8% of the total strains) and Enterococcus spp. The strains showed a low proteolytic activity. The isolates of S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus exhibited a widespread phage resistance. The nonlactic microflora comprised coliforms, yeasts, spore-forming bacteria and lactate fermentative bacteria. The samples showed an acidity level from 0.38 to 0.69% lactic acid (pH from 4.25 to 5.75). The acidifying activity was optimal at 45 degrees C. The advantages and disadvantages of the employment of natural milk starters are discussed.
TI  - The cpsABCDE genes involved in polysaccharide production in Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus strain NCBF 2393.
AB  - A 4074-bp EcoRI fragment of Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus (S. thermophilus) chromosomal DNA containing genes involved in exocellular polysaccharide (EPS) was identified and cloned. The nucleotide sequence of this fragment was determined and found to contain one partial and four complete open reading frames. These were designated cpsA, cpsB, cpsC, cpsD and cpsE and encoded proteins of > 130, 243, 230, 246 and 455 amino acids, respectively, that showed homology with the genes of the cps cluster, involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis, in Streptococcus pneumoniae Type 19F. The cpsA gene is predicted to encode a transcriptional regulator, while cpsC and cpsD are predicted to encode proteins involved in polysaccharide polymerization and export. The cpsE gene is likely to encode the phosphate-prenyl glycosyl-1-phosphate transferase catalyzing the first step in polysaccharide biosynthesis in S. thermophilus. Southern blot analysis revealed that cpsE is found only in polysaccharide producing strains of S. thermophilus.
TI  - Proline biosynthesis in Streptococcus thermophilus: characterization of the proBA operon and its products.
AB  - The presence of proline in the medium was not essential for growth of Streptococcus thermophilus, indicating that there is a proline biosynthetic pathway in this organism. Genetic and biochemical analysis identified and characterized this pathway. Two genes, designated proB and proA, were cloned, sequenced and characterized. Biochemical analysis of the proB- and proA-encoded enzymes showed that the proline biosynthetic pathway of S. thermophilus is similar to the one previously described in Escherichia coli. The deduced amino acid sequence of a 2-408 kb DNA region containing the genes revealed the similarity of the S. thermophilus gene products to ProB and ProA of E. coli and Serratia marcescens, and to the corresponding N- and C-terminal domains of the bifunctional plant enzyme delta 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase of Vigna aconitifolia. Northern blot analysis showed that the two genes in S. thermophilus are organized in a single operon with proB proximal and proA distal to the promoter; primer extension analysis indicated that proBA transcription is not under repressive control by exogenously supplied proline.
TI  - Characterization of a mosaic ISS1 element and evidence for the recent horizontal  transfer of two different types of ISS1 between Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - A 12-kb region of the Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ368 chromosome was found to  contain two copies of IS981 (one complete and one truncated) and three copies of ISS1 (two complete, ISS1SA and ISS1SC, and one truncated, delta ISS1SB). Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of these ISS1 elements with those of previously identified iso-ISS1 elements from Lactococcus lactis and the Enterococcus genus indicated that the ISS1 group is divided into three distinct subgroups which we have named alpha, beta and gamma. Nucleotide sequences of elements belonging to the same subgroup share more than 97% identity whereas sequences of elements from different groups share only 75-85% identity. Sequence analysis of ISS1SA and delta ISS1SB showed that they are members of the alpha group. We found that ISS1SC from S. themophilus CNRZ368, an ISS1 from L. lactis IL964 and IS946 from L. lactis TEK1 resulted from recombinations between alpha and beta elements. In addition, ISS1W from L. lactis Wg2 resulted from a recombination event between a gamma element and an ISS1 belonging to an unidentified subgroup. ISS1 sequences belonging to the alpha and beta subgroups were found in both S. thermophilus and L. lactis and gamma sequences were found in both the Enterococcus genus and L. lactis. The quasi-identity of some ISS1 elements in S. thermophilus and L. lactis and the distribution of alpha and beta elements suggest that horizontal transfer of ISS1 elements recently took place from L. lactis to S. thermophilus, two lactic acid bacteria used in the manufacture of cheeses. Since the presence of IS981 in S. thermophilus CNRZ368 also probably resulted from a horizontal transfer from L. lactis [Guedon et al. (1995) Mol. Microbiol. 16, 69-78], the 12-kb region bearing IS981 and ISS1 elements could be due to the integration of a lactococcal DNA fragment into the chromosome.
TI  - The galE gene encoding the UDP-galactose 4-epimerase of Brevibacterium lactofermentum is coupled transcriptionally to the dmdR gene.
AB  - The galE gene of Brevibacterium lactofermentum, encoding UDP-galactose 4-epimerase (EC 5.1.3.2), has been identified by DNA sequencing downstream from the orf1-sigB-dmdR region. The arrangement of the sigB-dtxR-galE cluster is also conserved in Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The deduced galE product was a protein of 329 aa residues (35.4 kDa) that shared a high degree of identity to known UDP-galactose 4-epimerase proteins from Gram-positive microorganisms (Streptomyces lividans and Streptococcus thermophilus). Transcriptional analysis of the dmdR and galE genes in nutrient-rich medium showed that these genes are part of an operon, that is actively transcribed as a bicistronic mRNA during the exponential growth phase, but transcription of the operon is decreased during the stationary growth phase. In addition, the dmdR gene was also expressed as a monocistronic 0.7-kb transcript during the active growth phase.
TI  - Disruption of the gene encoding penicillin-binding protein 2b (pbp2b) causes altered cell morphology and cease in exopolysaccharide production in Streptococcus thermophilus Sfi6.
AB  - Genetic and biochemical analysis of exopolysaccharide (EPS) production in lactic  acid bacteria has been a growing field of interest in the food industry. We previously identified and characterized a gene cluster composed of 13 genes (epsA to epsM) responsible for EPS production in Streptococcus thermophilus Sfi6. Here we report one further gene, pbp2b, that is connected to EPS production. Mutants with a gene disruption in pbp2b were no longer able to produce EPS, exhibited a reduced growth-rate, and their cell morphology was altered. The predicted gene product showed significant homology to the class B penicillin-binding proteins 2b of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mitis involved in peptidoglycan synthesis. Upstream of pbp2b, we further identified two genes which showed significant homology to the E. coli folD and urfl, which is an unidentified open reading frame presumed to be involved in DNA repair. Downstream of pbp2b, we identified a gene that showed homology to the Bacillus subtilis and the Escherichia coli recM or recR which, respectively, are involved in the methyl-dependent DNA mismatch repair. In S. thermophilus, pbp2b and recM were transcribed from their own promoters as monocistronic mRNAs and are therefore organized as independent transcriptional units.
TI  - Genomic organization of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Current knowledge of the genomes of the lactic acid bacteria, Lactococcus lactis  and Streptococcus thermophilus, and members of the genera Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus and Carnobacterium, is reviewed. The genomes contain a chromosome within the size range of 1.8 to 3.4 Mbp. Plasmids are common in Lactococcus lactis (most strains carry 4-7 different plasmids), some of the lactobacilli and pediococci, but they are not frequently present in S. thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus or the intestinal lactobacilli. Five IS elements have been found in L. lactis and most strains carry multiple copies of at least two of them; some strains also carry a 68-kbp conjugative transposon. IS elements have been found in the genera Lactobacillus and Leuconostoc, but not in S. thermophilus. Prophages are also a normal component of the L. lactis genome and lysogeny is common in the lactobacilli, however it appears to be rare in S. thermophilus. Physical and genetic maps for two L. lactis subsp. lactis strains, two L. lactis subsp. cremoris strains and S. thermophilus A054 have been constructed and each reveals the presence of six rrn operons clustered in less than 40% of the chromosome. The L. lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363 map contains 115 genetic loci and the S. thermophilus map has 35. The maps indicate significant plasticity in the L. lactis subsp. cremoris chromosome in the form of a number of inversions and translocations. The cause(s) of these rearrangements is (are) not known. A number of potentially powerful genetic tools designed to analyse the L. lactis genome have been constructed in recent years. These tools enable gene inactivation, gene replacement and gene recovery experiments to be readily carried out with this organism, and potentially with other lactic acid bacteria and Gram-positive bacteria. Integration vectors based on temperate phage attB sites and the random insertion of IS elements have also been developed for L. lactis and the intestinal lactobacilli. In addition, a L. lactis sex factor that mobilizes the chromosome in a manner reminiscent to that seen with Escherichia coli Hfr strains has been discovered and characterized. With the availability of this new technology, research into the genome of the lactic acid bacteria is poised to undertake a period of extremely rapid information accrual.
TI  - Gene for aspartate racemase from the sulfur-dependent hyperthermophilic archaeum, Desulfurococcus strain SY.
AB  - Amino acid racemases are ubiquitous throughout eubacteria. However, no amino acid racemases have yet been found in eukaryotes and archaea. We cloned a gene highly homologous to that for the aspartate racemase from the sulfur-dependent hyperthermophilic archaeum, Desulfurococcus strain SY. The product of the gene showed 35.2% amino acid sequence identity with the aspartate racemase of Streptococcus thermophilus IAM10064, and was also homologous to glutamate racemases around the putative catalytic cysteine residues. The encoded protein was expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein had amino acid racemizing activity, which was highly specific for aspartate and increased with temperature from 37 degrees C to 90 degrees C. Therefore, this was identified as the first hyperthermophilic archaeal amino acid racemase. A little aspartate racemizing activity was also detected in the crude extract of Desulfurococcus strain SY. The function of this aspartate racemase might be the uptake of -aspartate formed at high temperature or the production of -aspartate as a cell component. The fact that the amino acid racemases are distributed among both eubacteria and archaea suggests that endogenous -amino acids in mammals are also synthesized by amino acid racemases.
TI  - Selection of an adhesive phenotype of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus for use in fixed-bed reactors.
AB  - Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus was cultivated in a chemostat in order to obtain an adhesive phenotype of this strain. When the system was operated at low dilution rates (D < 0.2 h-1) for about 4 weeks, the strain formed a visible film on the surface of the culture vessel. The biofilm cells were not washed out even when dilution rates were increased (D = 6.9 h-1), and this resulted in a high biomass productivity (P = 4.1 g1(-1) h-1). On the other hand, when the culture was grown at dilution rates faster than 0.2 h-1, only the free suspended cells were present in the culture broth, and were washed out at velocities of about 1.0 h-1. The biomass productivity was consequently lower (P = 1.33 g1(-1) h-1) than in the previous case. The selected adhesive phenotype was grown on different glass beads and the possibility of lactate fermentation in a continuous and semicontinuous mode was demonstrated.
TI  - Evaluation of media for selective enumeration of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacteria.
AB  - Fifteen media were evaluated to determine their suitability for selective enumeration of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacteria using 5 to 6 strains of each of the four groups of organisms. Streptococcus thermophilus agar was found to be suitable for selective enumeration of S. thermophilus under aerobic incubation at 37 degrees C for 24 h. The MRS agar at pH 5.2 or reinforced clostridial agar at pH 5.3 could be used for the selective enumeration of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus when the incubation was carried out at 45 degrees C for > or = 72 h. However, the recovery of this organism was lower on MRS agar at pH 5.2 or reinforced clostridial agar at pH 5.3 than that obtained on MRS agar. The recovery of L. acidophilus and bifidobacteria on MRS agar and MRS-maltose agar was similar; MRS-maltose agar could be used to enumerate total counts of L. acidophilus and bifidobacteria. For selective enumeration of L. acidophilus, MRS-salicin agar or MRS-sorbitol agar could be used. For selective enumeration of bifidobacteria, MRS NNLP (nalidixic acid, neomycin sulfate, lithium chloride, and paromomycin sulfate) agar was suitable; however, determination of bifidobacteria by differential counts between L. acidophilus enumerated on MRS-salicin agar or MRS-sorbitol agar and the total counts of L. acidophilus and bifidobacteria obtained from MRS-maltose agar resulted in higher recovery of some strains of bifidobacteria. Other media that were evaluated in this study were not suitable for selective enumeration.
TI  - The effect of cations on the hydrolysis of lactose and the transferase reactions  catalysed by beta-galactosidase from six strains of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - beta-Galactosidases from Lactobacillus delbruekii subsp. bulgaricus 20056, Lb. casei 20094, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis 7962, Streptococcus thermophilus TS2, Pediococcus pentosaceus PE39 and Bifidobacterium bifidum 1901 were partially purified. The rate of hydrolysis of lactose given by the predominant beta-galactosidase activity from each of the bacteria studied was in all cases enhanced by Mg2+, while the effect of K+ and Na+ differed from strain to strain. The beta-galactosidases from all strains also catalysed trans-galactosylation reactions. The types of oligosaccharides produced appeared to be very similar in each case, but the rates of their production differed. All the beta-galactosidases were also capable of hydrolysing galactosyl-lactose although, unlike the other bacteria studied, Lb. delbruekii subsp. bulgaricus 20056 and Lc. lactis subsp. lactis 7962 were unable to utilise galactosyl-lactose as a carbon source for growth.
TI  - Unidirectional reconstitution into detergent-destabilized liposomes of the purified lactose transport system of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The lactose transport protein (LacS) of Streptococcus thermophilus was amplified  to levels as high as 8 and 30% of total membrane protein in Escherichia coli and S. thermophilus, respectively. In both organisms the protein was functional and the expression levels were highest with the streptococcal lacS promoter. Also a LacS deletion mutant, lacking the carboxyl-terminal regulatory domain, could be amplified to levels >20% of membrane protein. Membranes from S. thermophilus proved to be superior in terms of efficient solubilization and ease and extent of purification of LacS; >95% of LacS was solubilized with relatively low concentrations of Triton X-100, n-octyl-beta-D-glucoside, n-dodecyl-beta-D-maltoside, or C12E8. The LacS protein carrying a poly-histidine tag was purified in large quantities (approximately 5 mg/liter of culture) and with a purity >98% in a two-step process involving nickel chelate affinity and anion exchange chromatography. The membrane reconstitution of LacS was studied systematically by stepwise solubilization of preformed liposomes, prepared from E. coli phospholipid and phosphatidylcholine, and protein incorporation at the different stages of liposome solubilization. The detergents were removed by adsorption onto polystyrene beads and H+-lactose symport and lactose counterflow were measured. Highest transport activities were obtained when Triton X-100 was used throughout the solubilization/purification procedure, whereas activity was lost irreversibly with n-octyl-beta-D-glucoside. For reconstitutions mediated by n-dodecyl-beta-D-maltoside, C12E8, and to a lesser extent Triton X-100, the highest transport activities were obtained when the liposomes were titrated with low amounts of detergent (onset of liposome solubilization). Importantly, under these conditions proteoliposomes were obtained in which LacS was reconstituted in an inside-out orientation, as suggested by the outside labeling of a single cysteine mutant with a membrane impermeable biotin-maleimide. The results are consistent with a mechanism of reconstitution in which the hydrophilic regions of LacS prevent a random insertion of the protein into the membrane. Consistent with the in vivo lactose/galactose exchange catalyzed by the LacS protein, the maximal rate of lactose counterflow was almost 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of H+-lactose symport.
TI  - Performance of commercial cultures in fluid milk applications.
AB  - Six Lactobacillus acidophilus, 5 Bifidobacterium, and 6 Streptococcus thermophilus strains were studied for characteristics that are important to activity and stability in unfermented fluid milk products. Speciation, strain relatedness, frozen concentrate stability, bile sensitivity, and lactase activity were evaluated. The microbiological stability of a culture-containing fluid milk product was also determined. Two of the bifidobacteria cultures contained > 1 strain. Some strains were shown to be closely related or identical by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of fragmented chromosomal DNA. Selective media that distinguished among all 3 added genera were identified. All lactobacilli and most of the bifidobacteria were resistant to bile concentrations varying from 1 to 3%, and all streptococci were sensitive to bile. Lactase activities were highest for S. thermophilus strains, supporting use of this species in fluid milk and dairy products to aid in the digestion of lactose by consumers. The experimental product evaluated in this study contained 10(7) cfu/ml of both L. Acidophilus and Bifidobacterium spp. and 5 x 10(7) cfu/ml of S. thermophilus. Lactic, but not psychrotrophic, populations were fairly stable during storage. The results suggest that milk formulated with high concentrations of three different genera of probiotic bacteria can be manufactured with commercial strains.
TI  - Detection and localization of peptidases in Lactococcus lactis with monoclonal antibodies.
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies against peptidases of Lactococcus lactis were isolated and  characterized: PEPN1-4 against a lysyl aminopeptidase PepN, PEPT1-5 against a tripeptidase PepT and PEPD1-3 against a dipeptidase PepD. These monoclonal antibodies reacted specifically with their respective antigens in crude cell extracts of Lc. lactis subspp. cremoris and lactis. A number of monoclonal antibodies cross reacted with proteins of other (lactic acid) bacteria. PEPT1, 2, 4 and 5 cross reacted weakly with a 35 kDa protein in Lactobacillus delbrueckii, while PEPT1 and PEPT2 reacted with proteins in the cell-free extract of Streptococcus thermophilus and Clostridium fervidus. Of the four isolated monoclonal antibodies against PEPN, only PEPN3 cross reacted weakly with a 90 kDa protein in Escherichia coli cell-free extract, and the other three antibody species against PEPN3 cross reacted with 80 kDa proteins of Lb. casei, Lb. delbrueckii, and Str. bovis, but not of Esch. coli. Of the three monoclonal antibodies against PepD, only PEPD1 and PEPD2 cross reacted with 40 kDa proteins of Lb. casei, Lb. delbrueckii and Str. bovis. All PEPN, PEPD and PEPT antibodies reacted with components in cell-free extracts of eleven different Lc. lactis strains, indicating that the peptidases of these strains were very similar to those of Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris WG2. However, Lc. lactis subsp. hordniae appeared to differ from the other Lc. lactis subspecies since only PEPT1, 2 and 5 reacted with a protein in the cell-free extract. Immunogold labelling of Lc. lactis WG2 with the isolated monoclonal antibodies revealed that PepN, PepD and PepT were located intracellularly. The intracellular location of these peptidases is discussed in relation to the supply of essential amino acids and peptides.
TI  - The lactose transporter in Leuconostoc lactis is a new member of the LacS subfamily of galactoside-pentose-hexuronide translocators.
AB  - The gene encoding the lactose transport protein (lacS) of Leuconostoc lactis NZ6009 has been cloned from its native lactose plasmid, pNZ63, by functional complementation of lactose permease-deficient Escherichia coli mutants. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame with the capacity to encode a protein of 639 amino acids which had limited but significant identity to the lactose transport carriers (LacS) of Streptococcus thermophilus (34.5%) and Lactobacillus bulgaricus (35.6%). This similarity was present both in the amino-terminal hydrophobic carrier domain, which is homologous to the E. coli melibiose transporter, and in the carboxy-terminal enzyme IIA-like regulatory domain. The flanking regions of DNA surrounding lacS were also sequenced. Preceding the lacS gene was a small open reading frame in the same orientation encoding a deduced 95-amino-acid protein with a sequence similar to the amino-terminal portion of beta-galactosidase I from Bacillus stearothermophilus. The lacS gene was separated from the downstream beta-galactosidase genes (lacLM) by 2 kb of DNA containing an IS3-like insertion sequence, which is a novel arrangement for lac genes in comparison with that in other lactic acid bacteria. The lacS gene was cloned in an E. coli-Streptococcus shuttle vector and was expressed both in a lacS deletion derivative of S. thermophilus and in a pNZ63-cured strain, L. lactis NZ6091. The role of the LacS protein was confirmed by uptake assays in which substantial uptake of radiolabeled lactose or galactose was observed with L. lactis or S. thermophilus plasmids harboring an intact lacS gene. Furthermore, galactose uptake was observed in NZ6091, suggesting the presence of at least one more transport system for galactose in L. lactis.
TI  - Site-specific spontaneous deletions in three genome regions of a temperate Streptococcus thermophilus phage.
AB  - Site-specific spontaneous deletions were observed with high frequency in three regions of the genome of the temperate Streptococcus thermophilus phage phi SFi21. Deletion sizes were 750 bp (type 1), 2.7 kb (type 2), and 1 kb (type 3). Combinations of types 1 and 3 and 2 and 3 were observed. The mutants grew lytically although with reduced burst sizes. Type 2 mutants lost the capacity to lysogenize host cells. Upon serial passage, the deletion mutants overgrew the wild-type phage. No direct or inverted DNA repeats were associated with type 1 or 2 deletion sites. Several independent phage isolates showed deletions at identical nucleotide positions, suggesting a site-specific recombination system. Sequencing of an Xbal restriction fragment covering the type 1 deletion predicted a single long open reading frame (ORF) showing a high degree of amino acid similarity with two proteins from bacteriophage P1 implicated in its immunity control (KiIA, Ant). Type 1 deletion leads to a loss of the conserved C-terminal part of this ORF.
TI  - Synthesis of allyl beta-D-galactopyranoside from lactose using Streptococcus thermophilus beta-D-galactosidase.

TI  - Biotherapeutic agents. A neglected modality for the treatment and prevention of selected intestinal and vaginal infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential of biotherapeutic agents (microorganisms with therapeutic properties) for the prevention and/or treatment of selected intestinal and vaginal infections. DATA SOURCES: The MEDLINE database was searched for all relevant articles published between 1966 and September 1995. Search terms used were biotherapeutic agent, probiotic, Lactobacillus, Saccharomyces, Bifidobacterium, Candida, gastrointestinal- system, vaginitis, vaginosis-bacterial, and related terms. The bibliographies of obtained articles were also reviewed. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All placebo-controlled human studies on biotherapeutic agents were reviewed. English-language open trials, case series and reports, and animal studies were reviewed only if they were especially relevant to providing information on the potential efficacy, adverse effects, or mechanisms of action of these agents. DATA SYNTHESIS: Placebo-controlled studies have shown that biotherapeutic agents have been used successfully to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea (Lactobacillus caseiGG, bifidobacterium longum, B longum with L acidophilus, and Saccharomyces boulardii), to prevent acute infantile diarrhea (Bifidobacterium bifidum with Streptococcus thermophilus), to treat recurrent Clostridium difficile disease (S boulardii), and to treat various other diarrheal illnesses (Enterococcus faecium SF68, L caseiGG, and S boulardii). There is also evidence for Lactobacillus acidophilus in the prevention of candidal vaginitis. Few adverse effects have been reported. However, many of the studies tested only small numbers of patients or volunteers. CONCLUSIONS: There is now evidence that administration of selected microorganisms is beneficial in the prevention and treatment of certain intestinal and, possibly, treatment of vaginal infections. In an effort to decrease the reliance on antimicrobials, the time has come to carefully explore the therapeutic applications of biotherapeutic agents.
TI  - Development and characterization of lactose-positive pediococcus species for milk fermentation.
AB  - Bacteriophages against Streptococcus thermophilus are a growing problem in the Italian cheese industry. One possible control method involves replacing S. thermophilus in mozzarella starter blends with lactic acid bacteria from a different genus or species. In this study, we evaluated lactose-positive pediococci for this application. Because we could not identify any commercially available pediococci with fast acid-producing ability in milk, we transformed Pediococcus pentosaceus ATCC 25744, P. pentosaceus ATCC 25745, and Pediococcus acidilactici ATCC 12697 by electroporation with pPN-1, a 35-kb Lactococcus lactis lactose plasmid. Transformants of P. pentosaceus ATCC 25745 and P. acidilactici ATCC 12697 were then used to examine lactose-positive pediococci for properties related to milk fermentation. Both transformants rapidly produced acid and efficiently retained pPN-1 in lactose broth, and neither bacterium was attacked by bacteriophages in whey collected from commercial cheese facilities. Paired starter combinations of Pediococcus spp. and Lactobacillus helveticus LH100 exhibited synergistic pH reduction in milk, and small-scale cheese trials showed that these cultures could be used to manufacture part-skim mozzarella cheese. Results demonstrate that lactose-positive pediococci have potential as replacement cocci for S. thermophilus in Italian cheese starter blends and may facilitate development of new strain rotation schemes to combat S. thermophilus bacteriophage problems in mozzarella cheese plants.
TI  - Cation and sugar selectivity determinants in a novel family of transport proteins.
AB  - A new family of homologous membrane proteins that transport galactosides-pentoses-hexuronides (GPH) is described. By analysing the aligned amino acid sequences of the GPH family, and by exploiting their different specificities for cations and sugars, we have designed mutations that yield novel insights into the nature of ligand binding sites in membrane proteins. Mutants have been isolated/constructed in the melibiose transport proteins of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella typhimurium, and the lactose transport protein of Streptococcus thermophilus which facilitate uncoupled transport or have an altered cation and/or substrate specificity. Most of the mutations map in the amino-terminal region, in or near amphipathic alpha-helices II and IV, or in interhelix-loop 10-11 of the transport proteins. On the basis of the kinetic properties of these mutants, and the primary and secondary structure analyses presented here, we speculate on the cation binding pocket of this family of transporters. The regulation of the transporters through interaction with, or phosphorylation by, components of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system is also discussed.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence and analysis of pWC1, a pC194-type rolling circle replicon in Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - A 2.8-kb cryptic plasmid showing no homology to either pFX3 (rolling circle, pE194-type) or pCI305 (theta-type) lactococcal replicons was identified in Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris 2204. The plasmid, pWC1, was compatible with both pCI3340 (a pCI305 derivative) and pFX3 in L. lactis subsp. cremoris 2204. Sequence analysis of pWC1 showed one major ORF encoding a protein with a deduced size of 316 amino acids (aa). Database comparisons showed that the protein was distinct from the pFX- and pCI-type replication proteins (less than 21% aa identity), but shared significant homology (up to 57% aa identity) with the replication proteins from a different group of rolling circle plasmids (pC194-type) commonly found in gram-positive bacteria. A pC194-type rolling circle plasmid has not been previously described in L. lactis. Further sequence analysis showed a conserved double-stranded origin of replication in pWC1 preceded by a large (118-bp) direct repeat. The chloramphenicol-resistance gene from pC194 was inserted into a nonessential region of pWC1 to give pCP12. The host range of pCP12 included Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus, but not Escherichia coli. Both pCP12 and to a lesser extent pWC1 generated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) in L. lactis. A possible single-stranded origin of replication was identified by sequence analysis of pWC1 and by comparing levels of ssDNA produced by pCP12 deletion derivatives. The pWC1 replicon may be a useful addition to other replicons currently available for vector construction.
TI  - Identification and characterization of the eps (Exopolysaccharide) gene cluster from Streptococcus thermophilus Sfi6.
AB  - We report the identification and characterization of the eps gene cluster of Streptococcus thermophilus Sfi6 required for exopolysaccharide (EPS) synthesis. This report is the first genetic work concerning EPS production in a food microorganism. The EPS secreted by this strain consists of the following tetrasaccharide repeating unit:-->3)-beta-D-Galp-(1-->3)-[alpha-D-Galp-(1-->6)]-beta-D- D-Galp-(1-->3)-alpha-D-Galp-D-GalpNAc-(1-->. The genetic locus The genetic locus was identified by Tn916 mutagenesis in combination with a plate assay to identify Eps mutants. Sequence analysis of the gene region, which was obtained from subclones of a genomic library of Sfi6, revealed a 15.25-kb region encoding 15 open reading frames. EPS expression in the non-EPS-producing heterologous host, Lactococcus lactis MG1363, showed that within the 15.25-kb region, a region with a size of 14.52 kb encoding the 13 genes epsA to epsM was capable of directing EPS synthesis and secretion in this host. Homology searches of the predicted proteins in the Swiss-Prot database revealed high homology (40 to 68% identity) for epsA, B, C, D, and E and the genes involved in capsule synthesis in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus agalactiae. Moderate to low homology (37 to 18% identity) was detected for epsB, D, F, and H and the genes involved in capsule synthesis in Staphylococcus aureus for epsC, D, and E and the genes involved in exopolysaccharide I (EPSI) synthesis in Rhizobium meliloti for epsC to epsJ and the genes involved in lipopolysaccharide synthesis in members of the Enterobacteriaceae, and finally for eps K and lipB of Neisseria meningitidis. Genes (epsJ, epsL, and epsM) for which the predicted proteins showed little or no homology with proteins in the Swiss-Prot database were shown to be involved in EPS synthesis by single-crossover gene disruption experiments.
TI  - Antimutagenicity of yogurt.
AB  - Yogurt is milk fermented by a mixture of two bacteria: Lactobacillus delbrueckii  ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. Epidemiological studies have correlated a reduced risk of colon cancer with yogurt consumption. Independent studies have established that yogurt and extracts thereof are antimutagenic. Although multiple explanations can account for yogurt's putative anticarcinogenicity, we are interested in testing the hypothesis that antimutagenic compounds produced during fermentation are responsible. We recently reported on the antimutagenicity of an acetone extract of yogurt against the experimental carcinogens N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) and 3.2'dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl (DMAB) (Mutation Res. (1995) 334, 213-224). We are now aware that palmitic acid is an active ingredient against MNNG.
TI  - Comparison of the N-terminal sequence of NADH oxidase from Thermus aquaticus with those of other flavoenzymes.
AB  
TI  - Efficient insertional mutagenesis in lactococci and other gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - In lactococci, the study of chromosomal genes and their regulation is limited by  the lack of an efficient transposon mutagenesis system. We associated the insertion sequence ISS1 with the thermosensitive replicon pG+ host to generate a mutagenic tool that can be used even in poorly transformable strains. ISS1 transposition is random in different lactococcal strains as well as in Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus thermophilus. High-frequency random insertion (of about 1%) obtained with this system in Lactococcus lactis allows efficient mutagenesis, with typically one insertion per cell. After ISS1 replicative transposition, the chromosome contains duplicated ISS1 sequences flanking pG+ host. This structure allows cloning of the interrupted gene. In addition, efficient excision of the plasmid leaves a single ISS1 copy at the mutated site, thus generating a stable mutant strain with no foreign markers. Mutants obtained by this transposition system are food grade and can thus be used in fermentation processes.
TI  - Development of an expression strategy using a lytic phage to trigger explosive plasmid amplification and gene expression.
AB  - A novel plasmid-based expression strategy, exploiting two features of lytic bacteriophages, was developed in Lactococcus lactis. Components of this system include a phage origin of replication and phage expression signals, which were induced to high efficiency upon phage infection of the host. Phage-specific expression signals were cloned from phi 31 in a promoter-screening strategy using the lacZ gene from Streptococcus thermophilus. One clone exhibited a significant induction in beta-galactosidase production and concomitant increase in lacZ mRNA during the phi 31 infection cycle of the host. Molecular characterization of the cloned insert revealed 888 bp positioned near the phi 31 cos site. Primer extension analysis showed that transcription was induced approximately 20 min following phi 31 infection at four points, apparently organized in two sets of tandem promoters on the cloned phage insert. One of these middle phage promoters also showed a basal level of activity prior to phage infection. The phi 31 promoter lacZ cassette was cloned into a low-copy-number vector plasmid containing the phi 31 origin of replication (ori31) and the resulting low-copy-number plasmid exhibited negligible beta-galactosidase production in L. lactis. However, > 2,000 units were detected following a deliberate infection with phi 31. A control expression plasmid without ori31 could only be induced to 85 units. The combination of these phage-inducible expression signals together with ori31 functioned synergistically to drive rapid and high efficiency expression of a heterologous gene in L. lactis.
TI  - Lowering of ochratoxin A level in milk by yoghurt bacteria and bifidobacteria.
AB  - A decrease in the content of ochratoxin A (OA) was observed in milk samples fermented by yoghurt bacteria and bifidobacteria. OA was added to the milk before fermentation at a rate of 0.05-1.5 mg/L. No residues of OA were found in samples containing 0.05 and 0.1 mg/L of OA, fermented by S. Salivarius subsp. thermophilus, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and B. bifidum. Yoghurt bacteria (S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus) were the most effective since no residues were detected even in fermented samples containing originally 0.5 mg/L OA.
TI  - Lactobacillus- and bifidobacterium-mediated antigenotoxicity in the colon of rats.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are proposed to have several beneficial effects, including the inactivation of carcinogens. We have studied the potential of Lactobacillus acidophilus (from a commercially available yogurt), Lactobacillus gasseri (P79), Lactobacillus confusus (DSM20196), Streptococcus thermophilus (NCIM 50083), Bifidobacterium breve and Bifidobacterium longum (from human infant stool) to prevent the induction of DNA damage by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG, 7.5 mg/kg body wt) in colon cells of the rat. Using the new technique of single cell microgel electrophoresis, all investigated strains were antigenotoxic toward MNNG after a single dose of 10(10) viable cells/kg body wt p.o. eight hours before the carcinogen. One-half and one-tenth of this initial dose resulted in a loss of protective activity. High doses of heat-treated L. acidophilus strains were also not antigenotoxic. One mechanism of the preventive effect could be that bacterial metabolites or components are responsible. Accordingly, selected examples were investigated in vitro in colon cells of the rat. Metabolically active L. acidophilus cells, as well as an acetone extract of the culture, prevented MNNG-induced DNA damage. Different cell fractions from L. acidophilus (cytoplasm, cell wall skeleton, cell wall) were devoid of antigenotoxic activity, whereas the peptidoglycan fraction and whole freeze-dried cells were antigenotoxic. As a second carcinogen, 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) was used. A dose- and time-response study was first performed to assess the effects of DMH in several segments of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Exposure for 16 hours to 15 or 25 mg DMH/kg body wt p.o. induced DNA damage in cells of the distal colon of rats, whereas no cytotoxicity was seen. Pretreatment orally with LAB on four consecutive mornings before DMH gavage (8 hours after the last LAB application) revealed that L. acidophilus, L. confusus, L. gasseri, B. longum, and B. breve inhibited the genotoxic effect of DMH. One of four S. thermophilus and one of three Lactobacillus delbrueckeii ssp. bulgaricus strains were also protective. Heat-treated L. acidophilus did not inhibit DMH-induced genotoxicity. A few aliquots of the colon cells were processed immunohistochemically for the presence of the "proliferation cell nuclear antigen" (PCNA). DMH treatment did not increase PCNA, nor was there any modulation by LAB. The effect of L. acidophilus on foreign compound-metabolizing enzymes (Phase I and Phase II) in liver and colon cells of rats revealed only one parameter to be modulated, namely, a two- to three-fold increase in the levels of NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase. The meaning of this finding, in terms of possible chemoprevention by LAB, remains unclear. In conclusion, our studies show that most, but not all, LAB tested could strongly inhibit genotoxicity in the GI tract of the rat and that viable LAB organisms are required for the protective effect in vivo. The comet assay technique is a powerful tool to elucidate such in vivo antigenotoxic activities in tumor target tissues.
TI  - Role of intestinal bacteria in ileal ulcer formation in rats treated with a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug.
AB  - The role of intestinal bacteria in induction and repression of ulcer formation in the ileum of rats treated with one of the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), 5-bromo-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-(4-methylsulfonylphenyl) thiophene (BFMeT), was examined in this study. BFMeT was administered by intragastric gavage once at doses of 500-1,500 mg/kg of body weight to Wistar rats treated with and without antibiotics (bacitracin, neomycin, streptomycin), germ-free rats and gnotobiotic rats, and 72 hr later their gastrointestinal tracts were examined for ulcer formation. A single oral administration of BFMeT induced ileal ulcers in specific pathogen-free rats. However, the rats given antibiotics to reduce the intestinal bacteria had no ulcers. BFMeT-treated germ-free rats and gnotobiotic rats mono-associated with Bifidobacterium adolescentis or Lactobacillus acidophilus also had no intestinal ulcers. However, the drug induced ileal ulcers in gnotobiotic rats mono-associated with Eubacterium limosum or Escherichia coli. An overnight culture of B. adolescentis or L. acidophilus or yogurt containing Bifidobacterium breve and Streptococcus thermophilus, when given as drinking water, inhibited ulcer formation in the ileum of rats treated with BFMeT. Gram staining of the ileal contents of normal rats revealed that 97.4% of the stained microorganisms were Gram-positive rods and only 1.2% were Gram-negative rods. In the group of rats with ulcers induced by BFMeT, the Gram-positive rods decreased by 56.4% and the Gram-negative rods including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Proteus and Bacteroides increased by 37.3%. However, in the group of rats administered the Bifidobacterium culture, the Lactobacillus culture or yogurt, the percentages of the Gram-negative rods were decreased. Although Lactobacillus was a major bacterium in the ileum of normal rats, the Gram-negative facultatively anaerobic rods E.coli, Klebsiella and Proteus were increased in the ulcerated ileum of rats treated with BFMeT, suggesting that these bacteria are associated with ulcer formation in rats treated with NSAIDs, and that Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium inhibit it by repressing the growth of ulcer-inducing bacteria.
TI  - Tumor-specific transplantation resistance in mice after treatment of initial tumors with Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Antitumor activity observed by treatment with Streptococcus thermophilus was further investigated. The mice cured from fibrosarcoma by treatment with heat-killed preparation of S. thermophilus, when challenged with fibrosarcoma failed to take up the tumor. However, these cured mice when challenged with sarcoma-180 or Ehrlich ascites carcinoma, did not show significant changes in tumor take and/or survival compared to their respective controls. Similarly, mice cured from sarcoma-180 were challenged with fibrosarcoma, sarcoma-180 or Ehrlich ascites carcinoma. Though there was no change in the mean survival time (MST) of the dying mice regarding sarcoma-180 or Ehrlich ascites carcinoma, there was 50 and 30% increase in the number of mice that showed total regression respectively over controls. However, there was no difference in the growth rate of fibrosarcoma. Similar observations were made with mice cured from Ehrlich ascites carcinoma, challenged with these tumors. These findings thus suggest that the antitumor response was tumor-specific and that tumor-associated antigens may have a role in imparting this specificity. Bacterial treatment non-specifically augmented this primary response.
TI  - Modulation of proliferation, second messenger levels, and morphotype expression of the rat intestinal epithelial cell line IEC-6 by fermented milk.
AB  - Trophic effects of milk fermented with Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei, Bifidobacterium sp., or the combination of Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus (yogurt) were studied on the IEC-6 intestinal epithelial cell line. Incorporation of [methyl-3H]thymidine, mitochondrial dehydrogenase activities, cyclic AMP production, and differentiation of levels of the IEC-6 strain were evaluated between the 15th and 30th passage in culture. All fermented and unfermented milks enhanced trophic responses of IEC-6 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Compared with the corresponding milks, supernatant fractions were more effective in stimulating mitochondrial dehydrogenase response. Fermented milk supernatants were also more effective than the corresponding unfermented fractions. Increases in DNA synthesis and cyclic AMP confirmed the activation observed with mitochondrial dehydrogenase. Yogurt induced the more trophic response with an increased number of the more differentiated cell morphotype. Fermentation with L. casei also demonstrated an important trophic adaptation of IEC-6 cells. Milk processing by lactic acid bacteria enhanced trophic and proliferation responses of intestinal epithelial cell line IEC-6. These results suggested that IEC-6 cells could represent an accurate and easy in vitro model for testing the trophic quality of various nutrients and for an optimization of physiological digestive functions.
TI  - Antagonism of lactic acid bacteria towards Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia  coli on agar plates and in milk.
AB  - The antagonistic effect of lactic acid bacteria (LAB, including Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. casei and Streptococcus thermophilus) on Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli was evaluated on MRS agar with the deferred and cross-streaking techniques, and in milk with the plate counting method. All LAB were repressive to S aureus and E coli on the agar medium. However, their suppressive activity was significantly reduced when the agar medium was buffered to pH 7.2. In normal milk, L acidophilus strains A and B, S thermophilus and its combinations with L acidophilus A and L bulgaricus 6032 were inhibitory to S aureus, while in mastitic milk, only S thermophilus and its combinations showed inhibition. L acidophilus A and L bulgaricus 34104 were repressive to E coli growth in normal milk. S thermophilus and its combinations were inhibitory to E coli in both the normal and mastitic milk samples. These results indicate that the antagonistic activity of LAB on pathogenic bacteria varied with the type of media in which the tests were done, and that testing of in vitro antagonism in milk would be more informative than that in artificial media for in vivo tests concerning the possible roles of competitive microbiological ecology in mastitis control.
TI  - Observation of encapsulated lactic acid bacteria using confocal scanning laser microscopy.
AB  - The confocal scanning laser microscope allows direct observation of milk and cultured milks in their natural state. The microscope was used to observe the capsules of lactic acid bacteria growing in milk. Capsule production was confirmed by microscopic observation of cells suspended in latex beads. Some strains of Streptococcus thermophilus were surrounded by a capsule 4 to 5 microns in diameter, and others by capsules 2 microns in diameter. Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus strains showed capsule sizes from 1.5 to 3 micron in diameter. Of four strains of lactococci tested, three were unencapsulated, and one had capsule sizes of 1.5 and 2 microns around some cells. Encapsulated strains produced less acid in milk than did unencapsulated strains. Growth in Elliker's broth produced smaller capsules than did growth in milk. Capsules acted as a barrier to acid diffusing from the cell.
TI  - Highly bioluminescent Streptococcus thermophilus strain for the detection of diary-relevant antibiotics in milk.
AB  - Inefficient translational initiation is often the cause of poor foreign gene expression in gram-positive organisms. The expression of bacterial luciferase (lux) genes in Streptococcus thermophilus (bioluminescence) was improved by addressing this problem in two ways; by ribosome-binding site (RBS) replacement, and by enhancing lux RBS access by polymerase chain reaction modification either alone or combined with translational coupling to a truncated upstream open- reading frame (orf') having its own RBS. Lactococcal expression signals were employed for plasmid-based lux expression. The same constructs were used to monitor bioluminescence in Lactococcus lactis, as well as two non-lactic bacterial strains, for comparison. High lux expression was achieved in all four organisms with a heterodimeric thermostable enzyme. Surprisingly, where ready access to the lux RBS was predicted, translational coupling to the lactococcal orf remained a prerequisite for detectable lux expression in L. lactis. In contrast, high bioluminescence in S. thermophilus was independent of coupling. Consistent with these observations, inspection of published gene sequences suggests that RBS "strength" may be a more important factor in translation in S. thermophilus than in L. lactis. Using reduced light production in highly bioluminescent S. thermophilus as an indicator of biocide presence in milk, test times could be significantly shortened compared with a commercial test utilizing the related non-bioluminescent strain. lux genes appear to be sensitive, exponential-phase reporters of gene activity in S. thermophilus, an organism with molecular biology and genetics that remain largely unstudied.
TI  - Development of RAPD protocol for typing of strains of lactic acid bacteria and enterococci.
AB  - A protocol for typing strains of lactic acid bacteria and enterococci based on randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) fragments has been developed. Using a single 10-mer primer, fingerprints were achieved without the need to isolate genomic DNA. Different conditions of DNA release and amplification were investigated in order to obtain reproducible results and high discrimination among strains. This RAPD protocol was successfully applied for the typing of strains belonging to the species Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. helveticus, Lact. casei, Lact. reuteri, Lact. plantarum, Enterococcus faecalis, Ent. faecium and Streptococcus thermophilus.
TI  - 16S-23S and 23S-5S intergenic spacer regions of Streptococcus thermophilus and Streptococcus salivarius, primary and secondary structure.
AB  - The 16S-23S intergenic spacer region (spacer region 1) of Streptococcus salivarius, S. thermophilus, and Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris and the 23S-5S intergenic spacer region (spacer region 2) of S. salivarius and L. lactis subsp. cremoris were sequenced and compared with the spacer regions 1 and 2 of other streptococci. A high degree of intraspecific conservation was observed for S. thermophilus and L. lactis, and very similar sequences were found for S. salivarius and S. thermophilus. Whereas spacer region 1 is highly conserved in the genus Streptococcus sensu-stricto, only the tRNA gene and the rRNA processing stems are highly conserved in the three genera: Streptococcus sensu-stricto, Lactococcus, and Enterococcus. The presence of a unique tRNA(Ala) gene without the 3' terminal CCA sequence seems to be a general feature of the streptococci spacer region 1. A secondary structure model was built to show the interaction between the spacer regions 1 and 2 of S. thermophilus and S. salivarius. The rapid evolution of spacer region 1 in streptococci is in part due to insertions and deletions of small RNA stem/loop structures.
TI  - Rapid enzymatic method for biotyping and control of lactic acid bacteria used in  the production of yogurt and some cheeses.
AB  - Determination of enzymatic patterns of 30 strains of Streptococcus thermophilus and 18 strains of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus with a rapid APIZYM method was carried out. Alkaline and acid phosphatase, naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase, 10 esterases, 20 glycosidases, 61 peptidases and 2 proteases (trypsin and chymotrypsin) were included. The strains investigated were isolated from yogurt and from different starters used for different Italian cheeses. For S. thermophilus, all strains were positive for 3 glycosidases, 4 monopeptidases, 9 dipeptidases, 1 tripeptidase and all were negative for 2 esterases; 9 glycosidases; 8 peptidases and trypsin. For L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus it was observed that all strains were positive for 2 esterases; 2 glycosidases; 11 monopeptidases, 9 dipeptidases, 2 tripeptidases and 1 tetrapeptidase and all were negative for alkaline-phosphatase; 3 esterases, 7 glycosidases, 5 monopeptidases, 2 dipeptidases. The defined enzymatic pattern of starter cultures can be used for predicting their suitability for dairy fermentations and for monitoring their stability as well as for typing.
TI  - Enzyme thermostabilization by bovine serum albumin and other proteins: evidence for hydrophobic interactions.
AB  - BSA stabilizes Streptococcus thermophilus beta-galactosidase against thermal inactivation and binds to the active enzyme subunits formed on heating. The mechanism of interaction and stabilization, however, is unknown, and it was investigated using different proteins. The results show that several proteins increased the enzyme half-life (t 1/2) at 64 degrees C in the presence of the substrate lactose. The best stabilizers were BSA (9-fold) and casein (6-fold). There was a significant correlation between enzyme half-life (t 1/2) and surface hydrophobicity of the proteins (So), of the form t 1/2 varies; is directly proportional to S0.5o. The surface hydrophobicity of the enzyme increased upon heating, while that of BSA declined. Heating enzyme and BSA together caused a net loss in surface hydrophobicity, indicating hydrophobic interactions, but there was no change in the absence of heating. Stabilization of the enzyme by BSA was markedly affected by chaotropic and kosmotropic salts. Stabilization was increased by 1 M Na2SO4 and reduced by 1 M NaBr; 1 M NaCl had little effect. None of the three salts increased the stability of the enzyme itself, indicating that the effect was on the enzyme-protein interaction. The results indicate that BSA stabilized the enzyme by hydrophobic interactions with the heated enzyme and that surface hydrophobicity is a major determinant of the extent of stabilization by a protein.
TI  - Characterization of a temperate Streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophage and its  genetic relationship with lytic phages.
AB  - The temperate Streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophage phi SFi21 showed an 38-kb-long double-stranded DNA genome with cohesive ends. A single integration site was used in lysogens established in three different S. thermophilus strains. The attP and attB sites were localized on the restriction map of phage DNA and by hybridization on pulsed field separated bacterial DNA. All laboratory-established lysogens showed in addition to integrated prophage DNA unintegrated monomer phage DNA with unligated cos sites. The genetic relatedness of phi SFi21 DNA with DNA from lytic phages was studied in dot blot and Southern blot hybridization by using individual restriction fragments of phiSFi21 DNA as probes. Lytic group I phages hybridized with fragments of the central and the right part of the phiSFi21 genome but failed to hybridize with a fragment joining both parts. Lytic group II phages showed hybridization with the right half of the phiSFi21 genome. In lytic group IV phages, biologically a heterogeneous group, many different combinations of cross hybridization were detected in accordance with the hypothesis of the modular evolution of phage genomes.
TI  - [Comparison of methods for the detection and enumeration of lactic acid bacteria  in yogurt].
AB  - It is generally agreed that the population of lactic acid bacteria in yogurt must be not less than 10(6) ufc/g. Viability of the lactic flora until the end of shelf-life is affected for many factors, which has incidence in the recuperability of this microflora. MRS and LEE agar were selected for the total count of lactic bacteria, the M17 was used for the S salivarius ssp thermophilus and the RCA for L. delbrueckii ssp bulgaricus. Different methodologies were used for detection and enumeration of this bacteria: direct plate count; thermal treatment and recuperation of the injured cells in Soy Tripticase broth. The enumeration was done at time zero and 3 hours after the start of the fermentative process and during storage at 4, 12 and 21 days. The results shown an excellent recuperability of the lactic flora in the selected media and methods that were used: however the enumeration was significatively lower in the RCA agar. The counts in the LEE agar shown a better recuperability. The thermal treatment affected negatively the counts of lactic flora and the repair method shown better results in the yogurt sample during storage. pH and acidity were determined at the beginning and during the storage period. It was observed a pH decrease because of the lactic acid production at the end of shelf-life.
TI  - Amino acid requirements and peptidase activities of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus.
AB  - The aim of this work was to investigate the relationship between amino acid requirements and peptidase enzyme systems in three Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus strains. A synthetic medium without nitrogen components and a milk (RD milk) without its non-protein nitrogen fraction were prepared with different mixtures of amino acids. The strains showed different amino acid requirements. Some amino acids proved to be essential, some were required, while others did not affect growth. In the synthetic medium, only leucine and glutamic acid were essential for growth. In RD milk, the amino acid requirements were found to be lower, with only the absence of glutamic acid causing complete inhibition of growth. Relationships between aminopeptidase activities of the strains and their amino acid requirements were observed. Strains with higher amino acid requirements were also found to express a wider range of peptidases.
TI  - Effect of milks inoculated with Lactobacillus acidophilus or a yogurt starter culture in lactose-maldigesting children.
AB  - Dairy products containing live bacteria that possess lactase activity are used for dietary management of lactose maldigestion. The efficacy of acidophilus milk and the effect of consuming unfermented milk that had been inoculated with yogurt bacteria have not been examined in children. We compared scores for breath H2 excretion and symptoms of 20 lactose-maldigesting children following ingestion of 250 ml of uninoculated milk with two identical milks inoculated with 10(10) cells of Lactobacillus acidophilus or with a commercial yogurt starter culture containing 10(8) cells of Lactobacillus lactis and 10(10) cells of Streptococcus thermophilus. Nine of 10 subjects who were symptomatic following ingestion of uninoculated milk experienced a reduction in symptoms following ingestion of milk inoculated with L. acidophilus, without a decline in H2 excretion. Five of 6 subjects who were symptomatic following uninoculated milk had decreased symptoms and a significant reduction in H2 excretion following milk inoculated with the yogurt culture. For lactose-maldigesting children, milks inoculated with L. acidophilus or with a yogurt culture were associated with decreased symptoms compared with those with uninoculated milk.
TI  - Effect of a fermented infant formula containing viable bifidobacteria on the fecal flora composition and pH of healthy full-term infants.
AB  - We assessed the growth, tolerance, and acceptability as well as fecal flora composition and stool pH of 20 healthy full-term infants fed with a fermented whey-adapted infant formula containing viable bifidobacteria (10(6)/g of powder) during the first 2 months of life. This fermented infant formula, first biologically acidified by Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus helveticus, was compared to a whey-adapted, nonacidified, low-phosphate infant formula in a double-blind, randomized controlled study. The results were compared to a control group (n = 14) of fully breast-fed infants. The fermented whey-adapted formula containing viable bifidobacteria induced a prevalence of colonization with bifidobacteria at 1 month of age similar to that of breast-fed infants (12/20 versus 8/14) but significantly higher than in the group fed the standard infant formula (4/20). The mean bacterial count of bifidobacteria was similar in all colonized infants; however, fecal pH was significantly lower in the breast-fed infants than in the nonacidified bottle-fed infants. This kind of infant formula was well tolerated and promoted a normal growth during the first 2 months.
TI  - Regulation of glycerol and maltose uptake by the IIAGlc-like domain of IINag of the phosphotransferase system in Salmonella typhimurium LT2.
AB  - In Enterobacteriaceae the nonphosphorylated form of IIAGlc of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS) can inhibit the uptake and subsequent metabolism of glycerol and maltose by binding to, and inhibiting, glycerol kinase and the MalK protein of the maltose transport system, respectively. In this report we show that the IIAGlc-like domain of the membrane-bound IIN-acetylglucosamine (IINag) of the PTS can replace IIAGlc in a Salmonella typhimurium crr mutant strain that lacks all soluble IIAGlc. The inhibition was most severe in cells which were partially induced for the glycerol or maltose uptake systems. The Streptococcus thermophilus lactose transporter LacS, which also contains a IIAGlc-like domain, could not replace IIAGlc. Neither IINag nor LacS could replace IIAGlc in activation of adenylate cyclase.
TI  - Expression of a Lactococcus lactis Phage Resistance Mechanism by Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The 7.8-kb lactococcal plasmid pSRQ700 encodes the LlaII restriction/modification system which recognizes and cleaves the sequence 3(prm1)-GATC-5(prm1). When the plasmid pSRQ700 is introduced into a phage-sensitive Lactococcus lactis strain, strong phage resistance is conferred by the LlaII system. In this report, we show that pSRQ700 cannot replicate in Streptococcus thermophilus. However, if cloned into the vector pNZ123, the native LlaII system is expressed and strong phage resistance is conferred to various industrial S. thermophilus strains. Resistance against phages isolated from yogurt and mozzarella wheys was observed. To our knowledge, this is the first report of increased phage resistance in S. thermophilus.
TI  - Expression of Streptomyces melC and choA genes by a cloned Streptococcus thermophilus promoter STP2201.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus (ST) chromosomal DNA (chr DNA) fragments having promoter activity were cloned and selected in Escherichia coli using a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase- (cat-) based promoter-probe vector pKK520-3. Insertion of a promoterless streptomycete melanin biosynthesis operon (melC) downstream from the promoters of the library further identified clone STP2201 as a strong promoter in E. coli. Subcloning of a STP2201-melC DNA fragment into the pMEU-series S. thermophilus-E. coli shuttle vectors yielded pEU5xML2201x plasmids that conferred Mel+ phenotype to E. coli. The pEU5aML2201a was further shown to afford a high level of tyrosinase pro-anti-tyrosinase antiserum in S. thermophilus. Substituting melC with a streptomycete cholesterol oxidase gene (choA) in the same orientation yielded pEU5aCH2201a that conferred ChoA activity to an E. coli transformant at a level of (1.06 +/- 0.15) x 10(-7) units mg-1 protein. Introduction of this plasmid into S. thermophilus by electrotransformation yielded ChoA+ transformant that produced the enzyme at about 25% of the level found in E. coli.
TI  - [Antimutagenic action of bacterial culture liquid on mutagenesis induced by 2-nitrofluorene in Salmonella typhimurium strains].
AB  - It was shown that cell extracts and cells of Streptococcus faecalis decrease the  mutagenic effect of 2-nitrofluorene in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA1538 by 73 and 48%, respectively. Cell extracts and cells of Bifidobacterium bifidum and Propionibacterium shermanii exhibited weak antimutagenic activity. No antimutagenic effect was found in Escherichia coli AB1157, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, or Streptococcus thermophilus. Antimutageneicity of the cell extract of Str. faecalis is both associated with extracellular factors interacting with 2-nitrofluorene (desmutagenesis) and with factors affecting intracellular processes of mutagen biotransformation and mutation induction. Thiol compounds produced by growing Str. faecalis may be desmutagenic factors. A relatively heat-stable substance or substances of a peptide nature with a MM less than 12 kDa are antimutagenic factors affecting intracellular processes of mutagenesis.
TI  - Kinetic analysis of lactose and proton coupling in Glu379 mutants of the lactose  transport protein of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The role of Glu379 in the lactose-H+ symport protein (LacS) of Streptococcus thermophilus was studied by analyzing the kinetic mechanism of transport of wild-type and Ala379, Asp379, and Gln379 mutant proteins. Glu379 forms part of the sequence motif Lys-X-X-His-X-X-Glu that is present in a number of sugar transport proteins, including LacY of Escherichia coli. The E379A and E379Q mutants were defective in the uptake of lactose against a concentration gradient and lactose-dependent proton uptake, but catalyzed facilitated influx of lactose down a concentration gradient and equilibrium exchange with rates similar to that of the wild-type enzyme. The E379D mutant was partially defective in the coupled transport of lactose and protons. These results suggest that an acidic residue at position 379 is required for the coupled uptake of lactose and protons and are consistent with a mechanism in which lactose transport in the E379A and E379Q mutants occurs by uniport rather than proton symport. Lactose efflux down a concentration gradient in wild-type LacS and LacS-E379D increased with pH with apparent pK (pKa) values of > or = 8.5 and 8.0, respectively, whereas efflux in the E379Q mutant increased sigmoidally with a pKa of about 6.0. Imposition of an artificial membrane potential (inside negative) in membrane vesicles bearing wild-type LacS or LacS-E379Q not only inhibited the lactose efflux mediated by wild-type but also that of the mutant enzyme. To associate the role of Glu379 with specific step(s) in the translocation cycle of LacS, the properties of wild-type LacS and the Glu379 mutants have been evaluated by numerical analysis of simple kinetic schemes for translocation catalysis by solute H+ symport proteins. The properties of the wild-type enzyme are consistent with a mechanism in which the order of ligand binding on the inside is substrate first and proton last, whereas the order is random (or proton first, substrate last) at the outer surface of the membrane. The wild-type enzyme is asymmetric with regard to proton binding; the pK for proton binding on the outside is at least 4 units higher than the pK on the inside. The properties of the Glu379 mutants correspond with a lowering of the pK on the outside (pKOUT approximately pKIN), and the induction of a leak pathway in which the binary enzyme-substrate complex becomes mobile.
TI  - Characterization of the gor gene of the lactic acid bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ368.
AB  - Cloning and characterization of the gor gene of the lactic acid bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus, encoding glutathione reductase, are described in this paper. This enzyme is a part of the enzymatic defences against oxidative stress in eukaryotic cells and in Gram-negative bacteria, but was never found in Gram-positive bacteria before this study. The amino acid sequence shares extensive similarities with glutathione reductases from other organisms, e.g. 62% amino acid identity with Escherichia coli protein. Northern blot analysis and glutathione reductase enzyme assays gave evidence that the gene is expressed in aerobically growing cells.
TI  - Anti-mutagenic and immuno-stimulatory properties of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Statistically significant antigenotoxic activity was exerted by six of nine strains of lactic acid bacteria tested (Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Staphylococcus carnosus, Streptococcus thermophilus, L. rhamnosus, Enterococcus faecium and En. faecalis) against nitrovin and 2-aminofluorene in Salmonella typhimurium TA100 and TA97. The mutagenic activity of both mutagens was substantially decreased by viable bacteria; cells heated to 100 degrees C for 15 min were ineffective. In vitro, En. faecium stimulated the basic metabolic activities of human neutrophils which were essential for their antimicrobial and cytotoxic activity, whereas stimulation of guinea-pig macrophages was not so effective. Similar immuno-stimulatory effects were observed with both viable and heat-inactivated bacteria.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of the galactokinase gene from Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The objective of this research was to clone and characterize the galactokinase gene (galK) from Streptococcus thermophilus F410. Partially digested genomic DNA was cloned into pBR322 and transformed into galK Escherichia coli, and a galactose-fermenting transformant was isolated. Restriction analysis revealed that the transformant resulted from a Sau3A-HindIII 4.0-kb fragment. Galactokinase activity in the recombinant was 10 times that of the parent strain. Analysis of the DNA sequence showed the presence of a 1.3-kb open reading frame that had high homology with the galK gene from other organisms. A putative ribosome-binding site, start and stop codons, and -10 and -35 sequences were identified. The predicted protein had a molecular mass of 49 kDa, which corresponded to the estimated size of a band apparent by SDS-PAGE. Amino acid sequence homologies with other galactokinases ranged from 50 to 62% similarity. Northern blots were performed between the galK gene and mRNA from S. thermophilus. No hybridization signals were observed for cells grown in glucose, but cells grown in lactose or galactose gave moderate and strong signals. The results suggest that repression of the galK gene by glucose may be responsible for the galactose-releasing phenotype in these strains.
TI  - Characterization of a bacteriocin produced by Streptococcus thermophilus ST134.
AB  - A pH-dependent adsorption/desorption technique was used to screen Streptococcus thermophilus strains for the production of bacteriocins. Agar-diffusion tests with S. thermophilus strains as targets identified 13 out of 41 strains as producers of antibacterial activity. Thermophilin A, the bacteriocin-like substance present in the culture supernatant of S. thermophilus ST134 was purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation and ion-exchange chromatography, followed by ultrafiltration. Thermophilin A is a relatively heat-stable and apparently glycosylated bacteriocin with a bactericidal mode of action against sensitive cells.
TI  - Expression of cho and melC operons by a Streptococcus thermophilus synthetic promoter in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A 63-base-pair synthetic promoter, sP1, was synthesized on the basis of the nucleotide sequence of a putative Streptococcus thermophilus promoter. When inserted upstream from the Streptomyces cho operon in a recombinant plasmid, pUCO195P-36, sP1 activated the expression of the cho genes in Escherichia coli, as shown by the production of cholesterol oxidase by the transformants. The sP1-driven cholesterol oxidase production in pUCO195P-36-transformed cells was estimated to be 40% of that produced by P(lac)-mediated cho expression in a pUCO193-containing host. The recombinant pUCO195P-36 appeared to be segregationally less stable in E. coli DH5 alpha than in HB101. Its non-expressing counterpart, pUCO195P-1, was stable in both E. coli strains. The activity of sP1 was further demonstrated in E. coli by the expression of a Streptomyces melC operon. When placed upstream from the test operon in the pMCU22aPa construct, sP1 activated the melC expression as shown by the production of tyrosinase at (3.0 +/- 0.3) x 10(-3) U/mg and (16.0 +/- 1.0) x 10(-3) U/mg protein equivalent of cell extract in the absence and presence of isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside, respectively. The presence of a counter-oriented P(lac) at the 3' end of the operon in the pMCU22bPa plasmid reduced the sP1-mediated tyrosinase production by about 85%.
TI  - Antimutagenicity of an acetone extract of yogurt.
AB  - Reconstituted non-fat dry milk powder, fermented by a mixture of Streptococcus thermophilus CH3 and Lactobacillus bulgaricus 191R to produce yogurt, was freeze-dried and extracted in acetone. After evaporation of the acetone, the extract was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and tested for antimutagenicity. In the Ames test, significant dose-dependent activity was observed against N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), 4-nitro-quinoline-N-oxide (4NQO), 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl (DMAB), 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benz[a]anthracene (DMBA), and 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole acetate (Trp-P-2). Weak activity was observed against 1,2,7,8-diepoxyoctane (DEO), and no activity was observed against methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), or aflatoxin B1 (AFB1). In a related assay (Saccharomyces cerevisiae D7), significant antimutagenic activity was detected against MNNG and 4NQO. Activity against the experimental colon carcinogens MNNG and DMAB was examined further, as assayed in the Ames test (Salmonella typhimurium TA100). Compounds responsible for both activities were less soluble in aqueous solutions than in DMSO. Adjustment of yogurt pH to 3, 7.6, or 13 prior to freeze-drying and acetone extraction did not significantly alter the amount of anti-MNNG activity recovered. In contrast, extractability of anti-DMAB activity was significantly greater at acidic pH. Conjugated linoleic acid, a known dairy anticarcinogen, failed to inhibit mutagenesis caused by either mutagen, suggesting that other yogurt-derived compound(s) are responsible. Unfermented milk was treated with lactic acid, yogurt bacteria without subsequent growth, or both, to determine if formation of antimutagenic activity required bacterial growth. Extracts of the milk treatments exhibited the same weak antimutagenicity observed in unfermented milk, approximately 2.5-fold less than in the yogurt extracts, suggesting that antimutagenic activity is associated with bacterial growth.
TI  - Characterization and distribution of two insertion sequences, IS1191 and iso-IS981, in Streptococcus thermophilus: does intergeneric transfer of insertion sequences occur in lactic acid bacteria co-cultures?
AB  - A chromosomal repeated sequence from Streptococcus thermophilus was identified as a new insertion sequence (IS), IS1191. This is the first IS element characterized in this species. This 1313 bp element has 28 bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats and is flanked by short direct repeats of 8 bp. The single large open reading frame of IS1191 encodes a 391-amino-acid protein which displays homologies with transposases encodes by IS1201 from Lactobacillus helveticus (44.5% amino-acid sequence identity) and by the other ISs of the IS256 family. One of the copies of IS1191 is inserted into a truncated iso-IS981 element. The nucleotide sequences of two truncated iso-IS981s from S. thermophilus and the sequence of IS981 element from Lactococcus lactis share more than 99% identity. The distribution of these insertion sequences in L. lactis and S. thermophilus strains suggests that intergeneric transfers occur during cocultures used in the manufacture of cheese.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria in the treatment of acute rotavirus gastroenteritis.
AB  - We compared different lactic acid bacteria for their effect on the immune response to rotavirus in children with acute rotavirus gastroenteritis. After initial oral rehydration, 49 children aged 6 to 35 months with rotavirus gastroenteritis randomly received either Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei strain GG (LGG), L. casei subsp. rhamnosus (Lactophilus), or a combination of Streptococcus thermophilus and L. delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus (Yalacta) twice daily for 5 days. Serum antibodies to rotavirus, total number of immunoglobulin-secreting cells (ISC), and specific antibody-secreting cells (sASC) to rotavirus were measured at the acute stage and at convalescence. The mean (SD) duration of diarrhea was 1.8 (0.8) days in children who received LGG, 2.8 (1.2) days in those receiving Lactophilus, and 2.6 (1.4) days in those receiving Yalacta (F = 3.3, p = 0.04). The ISC response was comparable in the three study groups, but the rotavirus-specific immune responses were different. LGG therapy was associated with an enhancement of IgA sASC to rotavirus and serum IgA antibody level at convalescent stage. We conclude that certain strains of lactic acid bacteria, particularly LGG, promote serum and intestinal immune responses to rotavirus, and thus may be important in establishing immunity against rotavirus reinfections.
TI  - Antilisterial activity of thermophilin 347, a bacteriocin produced by Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus 347 isolated from yogurt produces a bacteriocin referred as thermophilin 347. The bacteriocin was evidenced in the neutralized, filtered and catalase treated culture supernatant fluid of the producer strain. After partial purification, thermophilin 347 exhibited a bactericidal effect against Listeria monocytogenes and several closely related lactic acid bacteria. The activity of thermophilin 347 was lost after protease treatment but was maintained after heating at 100 degrees C for 1 h; after autoclaving at 121 degrees C for 15 min the activity was reduced by 50%. SDS-PAGE of partially purified thermophilin 347 was used to detect bacteriocin activity corresponding to an apparent molecular mass between 2.5 and 6.2 KDa.
TI  - [Antimutagenic action of bacteria on mutagenesis induced by 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide in Salmonella typhimurium].
AB  - It is shown that in the presence of culture liquid and cells of Propionibacterium shermanii, P. pentosaceum, P. thoenii, P. coccoides, P. acnes, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Streptococcus thermophilus, Str. faecalis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Escherichia coli AB 1157 the mutagenicity of 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO) in Salmonella typhimurium TA 100 decreases significantly. The highest antimutagenic (desmutagenic) activity was found in culture liquid from all strains tested in the logarithmic growth phase; on aging of the cultures their antimutagenic activity decreased. The cells passaged in the medium containing 4-NQO demonstrate a higher antimutagenic activity than the control cells, and this effect is not related to the cell mutation. Young cultures of all studied propionic bacteria and of Str. faecalis release thiol compounds into medium. Thiol accumulation in culture liquid from P. shermanii between 10 and 24 h was accompanied by culture transition to the active growth. Over 24 h thiol content decreased. The maximal thiol accumulation by 24 h coincided with the maximal desmutagenic activity of the culture. It is suggested that desmutagenesis of the bacteria studied towards 4-NQO is connected with their production of reducing (possibly, sulfur-containing) compounds that inactivate electrophilic groups of the mutagen.
TI  - Use of HT-29, a cultured human colon cancer cell line, to study the effect of fermented milks on colon cancer cell growth and differentiation.
AB  - Epidemiological and in vivo and in vitro experimental studies have suggested that fermented milks may interfere with the emergence and/or the development of colon cancer. The results, however, remain inconclusive. This prompted us to develop a new approach based on the use of HT-29, a cultured human colon cancer cell line, to study at the cellular level the effect of fermented milks on colon cancer cell growth and differentiation characteristics. Undifferentiated HT-29 cells have been grown in the continuous presence of milks fermented by one of the following bacterial populations: Lactobacillus helveticus, Bifidobacterium, L.acidophilus or a mix of Streptococcus thermophilus and L. bulgaricus. Penicillin G was added to the cell culture medium, resulting in a complete blockade of bacterial growth without significant effect on bacterial viability. One out of the four bacteria species studied, namely L.acidophilus, was without effect on both cell growth and differentiation. The three other bacterial strains induced a significant, although variable, reduction in the growth rate of HT-29 cells, which resulted in a 10-50% decrease in the cell number at steady-state (i.e. at cell confluency). The most efficient strains in lowering the HT-29 growth rate were L. helveticus and Bifidobacterium. Concomitantly, the specific activities of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV), a sensitive and specific marker of HT-29 cell differentiation, and that of three other brush border enzymes (sucrase, aminopeptidase N and alkaline phosphatase) were significantly increased, thus suggesting that these cells may have entered a differentiation process. Altogether, these results indicate that the use of cultured colon cancer cells may be a useful tool to further study the effect of fermented milks on colon cancer and that bacterial strains may exert a different and specific effect on cancer cell growth and differentiation when used in fermented milk products.
TI  - Survival of yogurt-containing organisms and Lactobacillus gasseri (ADH) and their effect on bacterial enzyme activity in the gastrointestinal tract of healthy and hypochlorhydric elderly subjects.
AB  - The effect of the live bacterial yogurt cultures, namely Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus, and a mucosal adhering strain of Lactobacillus gasseri (ADH) on small intestinal and fecal bacterial characteristics was examined in 10 elderly subjects with atrophic gastritis and 23 elderly normal volunteers (11 received yogurt and 12 received ADH). Neither S thermophilus nor L bulgaricus was recovered from the stomach or small intestine of subjects fed yogurt or pasteurized yogurt. ADH was recovered from gastric or small intestinal aspirates in three of four subjects and in the stools of four of five subjects diagnosed with atrophic gastritis. In 11 of 12 normal subjects, ADH was isolated from stools. There was a significant reduction in fecal bacterial enzyme activity in both normal volunteers and subjects with atrophic gastritis after being fed with viable ADH. Adherent strains of bacteria such as ADH are likely to survive passage through the gastrointestinal tract and thus have greater metabolic effects.
TI  - Regulation of bacterial sugar-H+ symport by phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent enzyme  I/HPr-mediated phosphorylation.
AB  - The lactose-H+ symport protein (LacS) of Streptococcus thermophilus has a C-terminal hydrophilic domain that is homologous to IIA protein(s) domains of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS). C-terminal truncation mutants were constructed and expressed in Escherichia coli and their properties were analyzed. Remarkably, the entire IIA domain (160 amino acids) could be deleted without significant effect on lactose-H+ symport and galactoside equilibrium exchange. Analysis of the LacS mutants in S. thermophilus cells suggested that transport is affected by PTS-mediated phosphorylation of the IIA domain. For further studies, membrane vesicles of S. thermophilus were fused with cytochrome c oxidase-containing liposomes, and, when appropriate, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) plus purified enzyme I and heat-stable protein HPr were incorporated into the hybrid membranes. Generation of a protonmotive force (delta p) in the hybrid membranes resulted in accumulation of lactose, whereas uptake of the PTS sugar sucrose was not observed. With PEP and the energy-coupling proteins enzyme I and HPr of the PTS on the inside, high rates of sucrose uptake were observed, whereas delta p-driven lactose uptake by wild-type LacS was inhibited. This inhibition was not observed with LacS(delta 160) and LacS(H552R), indicating that PEP-dependent enzyme I/HPr-mediated phosphorylation of the IIA domain (possibly the conserved His-552 residue) modulates lactose-H+ symport activity.
TI  - High expression of a foreign reporter gene in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  
TI  - Homologous integration and transposition to identify genes involved in the production of exopolysaccharides in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  
TI  - Native promoter-plasmid vector system for heterologous cholesterol oxidase synthesis in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The cholesterol oxidase gene (choA) of a streptomycete was used as a model for studying heterologous gene expression in Streptococcus thermophilus, an essential bacterium in dairy food fermentations. The vectors pER82 and pER82P were developed from the 2.2-kb indigenous plasmid (pER8) of S. thermophilus ST108, and sP1, a 51-bp synthetic promoter patterned after a chromosomal sequence of S. thermophilus. The presence of sP1 promoter in pER82PbCOb with the choA insert aligned with the cat gene was essential for the intracellular production of cholesterol oxidase. The pER82PbCOb was apparently stable in S. thermophilus with no detectable evidence of deletion mutational events.
TI  - Physical and genetic map of Streptococcus thermophilus A054.
AB  - The three restriction endonucleases SfiI, BssHII, and SmaI were found to generate fragments with suitable size distributions for mapping the genome of Streptococcus thermophilus A054. A total of 5, 8, and 24 fragments were produced with SfiI, BssHII, and SmaI, respectively. An average genome size of 1,824 kb was determined by summing the total fragment sizes obtained by digestions with these three enzymes. Partial and multiple digestions of genomic DNA in conjunction with Southern hybridization were used to map SfiI, BssHII, and SmaI fragments. All restriction fragments were arranged in a unique circular chromosome. Southern hybridization analysis with specific probes allowed 23 genetic markers to be located on the restriction map. Among them, six rrn loci were precisely located. The area of the chromosome containing the ribosomal operons was further detailed by mapping some of the ApaI and SgrAI sites. Comparison of macrorestriction patterns from three clones derived from strain A054 revealed two variable regions in the chromosome. One was associated with the tandem rrnD and rrnE loci, and the other was mapped in the region of the lactose operon.
TI  - Detection and classification of Streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophages isolated from industrial milk fermentation.
AB  - In the last 30 years, 81 Streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophage isolates were collected from industrial yogurt (n = 40) and cheese (n = 41) fermentation. Forty-six distinct restriction patterns of phage DNA (11 in yogurt and 35 in cheese) were observed. The phages were investigated for host range, serological properties, and DNA homology to study whether these three independent techniques can be used to classify the phages into taxonomic groups. Yogurt factory-derived phages were classified into the same two subgroups by serology, host range analysis, and hybridization with subgroup-specific DNA sequences. Cheese factory-derived phages, however, could not be classified: the 35 cheese phage isolates with distinct restriction patterns showed 34 different host ranges. All but one cheese phage isolate showed serological cross-reactivity with yogurt phages. A phage DNA fragment that hybridized with all phage DNA samples was cloned, establishing the genetic relatedness of all S. thermophilus phages from our collection. With the sequence information from an unusually conserved S. thermophilus phage DNA element (H. Brussow, A. Probst, M. Fremont, and J. Sidoti, Virology 200:854-857, 1994), a PCR-based phage detection method was developed for cheese whey from a factory that produced mozzarella cheese with complex undefined starter mixes. PCR allowed the detection of phages in cheese whey (detection limit, 10(3) PFU/ml) which could not be detected by dot blot hybridization techniques (detection limit, 10(7) PFU/ml).
TI  - Influence of bile on beta-galactosidase activity of component species of yogurt starter cultures.
AB  - The influence of bile on beta-galactosidase activity and the cellular integrity of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus were tested. Two strains (OS 1 and OS 2) of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and three strains (HC 15, 17, and 18) of S. salivarius ssp. thermophilus were studied. In the presence of .15% oxgall, beta-galactosidase activity of whole cells of both species was significantly increased. However, at a higher concentration (.3% oxgall), the beta-galactosidase activity was significantly less than in the presence of .15% oxgall. The presence of oxgall did not promote the cell lysis of any of the strains of either species. Additionally, the presence of oxgall did not cause the leakage of the enzyme from the cells. Thus, the presence of oxgall increased the cellular permeability to allow more substrate to enter the cells, thereby increasing beta-galactosidase activity, and, at higher concentrations, was inhibitory to beta-galactosidase activity of both species.
TI  - On-line estimation of biological variables during pH controlled lactic acid fermentations.
AB  - Indirect measurement of lactose, galactose, lactic acid, and biomass concentration from on-line sodium hydroxide weight measurements have been obtained for pure and mixed batch cultures of Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus 404 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 398 conducted at controlled pH and temperature. Linear correlations were established between the equivalent sodium hydroxide concentration and the lactose (substrate), galactose and lactic acid (products) concentrations while nonlinear relationships were developed between biomass and lactic acid concentrations. These nonlinear relationships took into account the inhibitory effect of lactic acid on growth and acidification. The indirect measurements of biomass concentration were introduced into a nonlinear estimator of the state variables and of the specific growth and lactic acid production rates. Good agreement was found between estimated and measured biomass concentrations (error index ranging from 10.8% to 12.6%). The results showed the feasibility of on-line estimation of biomass concentration and of the specific kinetics from NaOH addition weight measurements and its applicability for monitoring lactic acid fermentations. Using off-line measurements of L(+) and D(-) lactic acid concentrations, the evolution of the concentration of each strain in mixed cultures was obtained from the relationships proposed for the mixed cultures.

TI  - Antimutagenicity of fermented milk.
AB  - Reconstituted nonfat dry milk was fermented by Lactobacillus helveticus CH65, Lactobacillus acidophilus BG2FO4, Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus CH3, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 191R, and by a mixture of the latter two organisms. The fermented milks were then freeze-dried, extracted in acetone, dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide, and assayed for antimutagenicity in the Ames test (Salmonella typhimurium TA 100) against N-methyl, N'-nitro, N-nitroso-guanidine, and 3,2'-dimethyl-4-amino-biphenyl. Dose-dependent activity was significant against both mutagens in all extracts. Maximal inhibitory activity against 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl and N-methyl, N'-nitro, N-nitroso-guanidine was 2- and 2.7-fold greater, respectively, than that exhibited by extracts of unfermented milk. Extracts of milk fermented by L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 191R were examined further. Compounds that were responsible for activity against both mutagens were less soluble in aqueous solutions than in dimethylsulfoxide. Adjustment of milk fermented by L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 191R to pH 3, 7.6, or 13 prior to freeze-drying and acetone extraction did not significantly alter the activity specific for 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl. In contrast, compounds with activity specific for N-methyl, N'-nitro, N-nitrosoguanidine were less extractable at pH 7.6. The weak antimutagenicity of unfermented milk was not increased by addition of 2% L-lactic acid.
TI  - Absence of cholic acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity in the strains of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium.
AB  - To investigate the presence of 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity on bile acids in the bacterial strains of fermented milk products, 46 strains of Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus gasseri, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium longum, Lactococcus lactis spp. lactis, and Streptococcus salivarius spp. thermophilus were tested for their ability to produce deoxycholic acid from cholic acid. The production of deoxycholic acid was quantitatively measured by radiochromatographic analysis in anaerobically prepared washed whole resting cells and by HPLC analysis in growing cultures. Resting whole cells from a positive control strain, Eubacterium lentum-like strain c-25, converted 81.7% of .2 mM cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and 3.7% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid, when the cell suspension was incubated anaerobically at a concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml for 4 h at pH 7.3. However, none of the test strains investigated in this study was able to transform cholic acid under the same conditions. In growing cultures, 91.5% of 150 micrograms/ml of cholic acid was transformed to deoxycholic acid and 1.1% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid by E. lentum-like c-25 after a 7-d anaerobic incubation. None of the test strains showed production of either deoxycholic acid or 7-keto-deoxycholic acid as growing cultures.
TI  - Genotyping of Streptococcus thermophilus evidenced by restriction analysis of ribosomal DNA.
AB  - Twenty strains of Streptococcus thermophilus were classified into five different  types characterized by ribotyping after DNA digestion with HindIII and hybridization with cDNA from 16S-23S rDNA of Escherichia coli. Ribotyping after digestion with HaeIII and XhoI enabled the same strains to be gathered into three groups as a consequence of the reduced influence of the flanking sequences within the analysis of rRNA operons. Amplified rDNA restriction analysis clearly confirmed the discrimination of these three different ribotypes, producing evidence to suggest that subtaxa are to be recognized within this species.
TI  - Feeding of Bifidobacterium bifidum and Streptococcus thermophilus to infants in hospital for prevention of diarrhoea and shedding of rotavirus.
AB  - Acute diarrhoea is a serious cause of infant morbidity and mortality, and the development of preventive measures remains an important goal. Bifidobacteria (which constitute the predominant intestinal flora of breastfed infants), as well as other lactic-acid-producing organisms such as Streptococcus thermophilus, are thought to have a protective effect against acute diarrhoeal disease. However, their efficacy has not been assessed in controlled trials. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, infants aged 5-24 months who were admitted to a chronic medical care hospital were randomised to receive a standard infant formula or the same formula supplemented with Bifidobacterium bifidum and S thermophilus. Patients were evaluated daily for occurrence of diarrhoea, and faecal samples, obtained weekly, were analysed for rotavirus antigen by enzyme immunoassay. Faecal samples were also obtained during an episode of diarrhoea for virological and bacteriological analyses. 55 subjects were evaluated for a total of 4447 patient-days during 17 months. 8 (31%) of the 26 patients who received the control formula and 2 (7%) of 29 who received the supplemented formula developed diarrhoea during the course of the study (p = 0.035, Fisher's exact test, two-tailed). 10 (39%) of the subjects who received the control formula and 3 (10%) of those who received the supplemented formula shed rotavirus at some time during the study (p = 0.025). The supplementation of infant formula with B bifidum and S thermophilus can reduce the incidence of acute diarrhoea and rotavirus shedding in infants admitted to hospital.
TI  - Purification and characterization of a general aminopeptidase (St-PepN) from Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus CNRZ 302.
AB  - A general aminopeptidase (St-PepN) was purified from an intracellular extract of  Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus CNRZ 302 by ion-exchange chromatography and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Gel electrophoresis of the purified enzyme in denaturing or nondenaturating conditions showed a single protein band. The enzyme is a monomer with a molecular mass of 97 kDa. Its activity is maximal at pH 7 and 36 degrees C and is completely abolished by CuCl2 and ZnCl2. The enzyme is strongly inhibited by metal-chelating reagents, such as EDTA and o-phenanthroline, which suggests that St-PepN is a metalloenzyme. The enzyme showed activity toward p-nitroanilide derivatives or dipeptides and tripeptides and showed a preference for hydrophobic or basic amino acids at the N-terminal position. Longer peptide chains, such as the B-chain of insulin, glucagon, or peptides generated by the hydrolysis of caseins, were degraded, too. The sequence of the first 21 residues of the mature enzyme was determined and showed high homology with that of the aminopeptidase PepN isolated from Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris Wg2. The properties of the enzyme are compared with those of corresponding enzymes of other species of lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Isolation and characterisation of promoter regions from Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Four promoter regions required for the expression of a promoterless antibiotic resistance gene (cat194) in Streptococcus thermophilus were isolated by random chromosomal cloning experiments. These were shown to be functional in vivo, and their sequences were determined. Each region expressed different amounts of Cat protein as determined by enzyme activities. One region, STP10, was found to contain the 5' coding region of the large ribosomal subunit protein L20.
TI  - Aminopeptidase N from Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus NCDO 573: purification and properties.
AB  - A 96 kDa aminopeptidase was purified from Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus NCDO 573. The enzyme had similar properties to aminopeptidases isolated from lactococci and lactobacilli and showed a high degree of N-terminal amino acid sequence homology to aminopeptidase N from Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris. It catalysed the hydrolysis of a range of aminoacyl 4-nitroanilides and 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin derivatives, dipeptides, tripeptides and oligopeptides. In common with aminopeptidases from other lactic acid bacteria, the enzyme from Strep. salivarius subsp. thermophilus showed highest activity with lysyl derivatives but was also very active with arginyl and leucyl derivatives. Relative activity with alanyl, phenylalanyl, tyrosyl, seryl and valyl derivatives was considerably lower and with glycyl, glutamyl and prolyl derivatives almost negligible. The aminopeptidase also catalysed the hydrolysis of dipeptides and tripeptides but mostly at rates much less than that with L-lysyl-4-nitroanilide and oligopeptides. The enzyme catalysed the successive hydrolysis of various amino acid residues from the N-terminus of several oligopeptides but it was unable to cleave peptide bonds on the N-terminal side of a proline residue.
TI  - Gene cloning and characterization of PepC, a cysteine aminopeptidase from Streptococcus thermophilus, with sequence similarity to the eucaryotic bleomycin hydrolase.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ 302 contains at least three general aminopeptidases able to hydrolyze Phe-beta-naphthylamide substrate. The gene encoding one of these aminopeptidases was cloned from a total DNA library of S. thermophilus CNRZ 302 constructed in Escherichia coli TG1 using pBluescript plasmid. The wild-type TG1 strain, although not deficient in aminopeptidase activity, is unable to hydrolyze the substrate Phe-beta-naphthylamide, and thus the library could be screened with an enzymic plate assay using this substrate. One clone was selected which was shown to express an aminopeptidase, identified as a PepC-like enzyme on the basis of cross-reactivity with polyclonal antibodies directed against the lactococcal PepC cysteine aminopeptidase. The gene was further subcloned and sequenced. A complete open reading frame coding for a 445-residue (50414 Da) polypeptide was identified. 70% identity was found between the deduced amino acid sequence and the sequence of PepC from Lactococcus lactis subspecies cremoris, confirming the identity of the cloned gene. High sequence similarity (38% identity) was also found with an eucaryotic enzyme, bleomycin hydrolase. In addition, the predicted amino acid sequence of the streptococcal PepC showed a region of strong similarity to the active site of cysteine proteinases with conservation of the residues involved in the catalytic site. The product of the cloned pepC gene was overproduced in E. coli and was purified from a cellular extract. Purification to homogeneity was achieved by two-step ion-exchange chromatography. Biochemical characterization of the pure recombinant enzyme confirms that the cloned peptidase is a thiol aminopeptidase possessing a broad specificity. The enzyme has a molecular mass of 300 kDa suggesting an hexameric structure. On the basis of sequence similarities as well as common biochemical and enzymic properties, the bacterial PepC-type enzymes and the eucaryotic bleomycin hydrolase constitute a new family of thiol aminopeptidases among the cysteine peptidases.
TI  - Molecular cloning and sequence analysis of the gene encoding the H2O2-forming NADH oxidase from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans induces both H2O2-forming and H2O-forming NADH oxidases in the presence of O2 [M. Higuchi, J. Gen. Microbiol., 130, 1819-1826 (1984)]. In this paper, a nox-1 gene encoding H2O2-forming NADH oxidase (NOX-1) from Streptococcus mutans was cloned, and the nucleotides sequenced. The structural gene of nox-1 consisted of 1530 base pairs, which encode a polypeptide consisting of 510 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 55,196 Da. The deduced N-terminal amino acid sequence was consistent with that previously found for the purified NOX-1 protein. The nox-1 gene was expressed in Escherichia coli using its own promoter. Alignment of the amino acid sequence of NOX-1 with those of NADH oxidases from other microorganisms showed identities of 55.6%, 20.8%, 20.3%, and 7.3% for those of Amphibacillus xylanus Ep01, Streptococcus faecalis 10C1, Thermoanaerobium brockii Rt8.G4, and Thermus thermophilus HB8, respectively.
TI  - Cloning and nucleotide sequencing of L-lactate dehydrogenase gene from Streptococcus thermophilus M-192.
AB  - The gene encoding L-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was cloned from an industrial dairy strain of Streptococcus thermophilus M-192 using a synthetic oligonucleotide probe based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. The enzyme was deduced to have 328 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 35,428 and found to have high sequence similarity to LDHs from other lactic acid bacteria (89.0% to Streptococcus mutans, 76.3% to Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, 67% to Lactobacillus casei, and 60% to Lactobacillus plantarum). The gene contained a promoter-like sequence similar to the Escherichia coli promoter consensus, and expression of the S. thermophilus LDH gene was observed in E. coli cells.
TI  - Direct screening of recombinants in gram-positive bacteria using the secreted staphylococcal nuclease as a reporter.
AB  - A system for direct screening of recombinant clones in Lactococcus lactis, based  on secretion of the staphylococcal nuclease (SNase) in the organism, was developed. The nuc gene (encoding SNase) was cloned on both rolling-circle and theta-replicating plasmids. L. lactis strains containing these nuc+ plasmids secrete SNase and are readily detectable by a simple plate test. A multicloning site (MCS) was introduced just after the cleavage site between leader peptide and the mature SNase, without affecting nuclease activity. Cloning foreign DNA fragments into any site of the MCS interrupts nuc and thus results in nuc mutant clones which are easily distinguished fron nuc+ clones on plates. The utility of this system for L. lactis was demonstrated by cloning an antibiotic resistance marker and Escherichia coli chromosomal DNA fragments into the MCS of the nucMCS cassette. Both cloning vectors containing the nucMCS cassette were also introduced into Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, in which direct screening of nuc mutant recombinant clones was also achieved. The potential uses of nuc as a secretion reporter system are discussed.
TI  - Distinct Streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophages share an extremely conserved DNA fragment.
AB  - A cross-hybridizing 2.2-kb EcoRI fragment was cloned from two lytic Streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophages with distinct phenotypes. The DNA fragments, which contained two unidentified open reading frames, differed at only 3 of 2207 nucleotide positions. Partial sequencing of a temperate S. thermophilus phage and of a further lytic phage belonging to a different lytic group isolated 20 years earlier from a different geographical area confirmed this extreme sequence conservation. Hybridization of this phage DNA with bacterial host DNA was not observed. The evolutionary implications of these observations are briefly discussed.
TI  - Antilisterial activity by enterococci in a model predicting the temperature evolution of Taleggio, an Italian soft cheese.
AB  - Enterococcus ssp. produced broad-spectrum bacteriocins, which were active against Listeria innocua and Listeria monocytogenes. Inhibition of L. innocua in milk by different starter cultures was evaluated. Milk was inoculated with a conventional starter (Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus mixed cultures) as a sole starter or in combination with inhibitory starter cultures (Enterococcus ssp., bacteriocin-producing strains). Tests were performed under a temperature gradient that reproduced the first 55 h of Taleggio cheese manufacturing and in the presence of rennet. Results indicated that satisfactory inhibition of L. innocua was linked to the combined synergistic antimicrobial effect of pH decrease and bacteriocin production. Overall, data suggested that a potential existed for use of the antagonistic activity from enterococci for protection of Taleggio cheese during ripening, when L. monocytogenes may often reach dangerous concentrations.
TI  - Microbiological evaluation of jejunal aspirates and faecal samples after oral administration of bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - A double-blind placebo controlled investigation was carried out to study the effect of peroral colonization. Human volunteers were given mixtures of bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria. Measurements were made over a 1 week treatment period and for another week after the end of the treatment. Two different bacteriological preparations were used, one consisted of Enterococcus faecium and Bifidobacterium longum (a total of 6.4 x 10(8) cfu d-1); the other consisted of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bif. bifidum, Lact. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and Streptococcus thermophilus (a total of 9 x 10(9) cfu d-1). Together with a placebo preparation, they were given to 24 healthy controls (eight in each group). Microbiological examinations of jejunal aspirates showed that viable counts of most species were below the detection limit. However, the test preparation containing Ent. faecium and Bif. longum significantly reduced the anaerobe: aerobe ratio in faeces by a factor of three during treatment (P = 0.03), and increased it by a factor of 30 during the following week (P < 0.02). This study shows that peroral administration of certain bacterial cultures may affect the distal intestinal microflora.
TI  - Multifactorial experimental design for optimizing transformation: Electroporation of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - A multifactorial process was used to optimize transformation of Streptococcus thermophilus by electroporation. Simple experimental designs were applied to study three, four, or five factors in eight experiments. Four qualitative factors, growth and recovering media, and plasmid and bacterial strains, were studied empirically. Eight quantitative factors, including electrical, physiological, and chemical parameters, were studied by fractional factorial designs. Effects of individual parameters as well as interactions between them were investigated and optimized. Optimization was performed for one S. thermophilus strain, ST11, and proved to work for all other tested strains of the same species. Transformation efficiencies of 9 x 10(2) to 6 x 10(5) transformants per microgram DNA were achieved, depending on the strains and vectors used. (c) 1994 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
TI  - Microbiological quality of French yogurts commercialized in Spain.
AB  - The microbiological quality has been evaluated in 6 batches of yogurt (plain, flavoured and fruit-added) produced commercially in France and purchased in Spain. The essential microflora: Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and contaminants (coliform bacteria, yeasts and molds) were checked. The pH was also measured. The totality of the samples tested fulfilled French and Spanish regulation with respect to the presence of viable yogurt organisms. Likewise, in 100% of the yogurts, counts of contaminants were under 10 cfu/g. The pH ranged between 3.92 and 4.19.
TI  - Partial characterization of an rpoD-like gene of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ML3 with a polymerase chain reaction-based approach.
AB  - With degenerated oligonucleotide primers for conserved regions of bacterial sigma factor proteins, a 117-bp internal DNA fragment of an rpoD-like gene of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ML3 was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The DNA sequence of this PCR product was determined by cycle sequencing, and the deduced amino acid sequence of this internal fragment showed an extensive homology with the known sigma factor sequences from six other microorganisms and present a 13-amino acid region corresponding to the typical "RpoD box" of primary sigma factors. This PCR product was used as a probe to specifically detect sigma homologs in Pediococcus acidilactici, Leuconostoc lactis, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris. These data are consistent with the existence of a high similarity between the primary sigma factors from diverse Gram-positive microorganisms.
TI  - Identification of the replication region of Streptococcus thermophilus No. 29 plasmid pST1.
AB  - The replication region of the 2.77-kilobases (kb) plasmid pST1 from Streptococcus thermophilus No. 29 was identified. Deletion derivatives of pST1 were introduced into plasmid-free S. thermophilus No. 29 and examined for their ability to replicate autonomously. The nucleotide sequence had one open reading frame encoded for a 315 amino acid protein (Rep). Comparisons with proteins encoded by other Gram-positive bacterial plasmids strongly suggest that the deduced protein (RepS) encoded by pST1 has a replicative role. pST1 also contains a DNA sequence similar to the origin nick sequences of pLP1 or pLAB1000, which initiate plasmid replication at the plus origin. In a maxicell system, E. coli CSR603 carrying pSTUC4 produced a protein that was considered to correspond to the product of the RepS gene. These results strongly suggest that pST1 is replicated following a rolling-circle mechanism via single-stranded DNA intermediates.
TI  - Shuttle vectors developed from Streptococcus thermophilus native plasmid.
AB  - pER8 (2.2 kb), a native plasmid of Streptococcus thermophilus ST108, was used to  develop pMEU-series shuttle vectors. In addition to the replication function of the pER8, these vectors contain origin of replication and beta-lactamase gene (bla) of Escherichia coli vector pUC18/19, the cat gene of pC194, and the pPV141-borne erm determinant of Staphylococcus hyicus ssp. chromogenes 3688. pMEU5a, pMEU5b, pMEU6a, and pMEU6b (all 5.7 kb in size) contain bla and erm markers, are capable of transforming E. coli and S. thermophilus at frequencies in the order of 10(5)-10(6) and 10(3) colony forming units (CFU)/microgram DNA, respectively, and are highly stable in the two host systems. pMEU9 and pMEU10 (both 6.9 kb) contain the cat marker in addition to the DNA elements found in pMEU5-6. These plasmids are also highly effective in transforming E. coli (at ca. 6 x 10(5) CFU/microgram DNA) and S. thermophilus (ca. 10(3) CFU/microgram DNA). Although expression of the resistance markers is not completely consistent, pMEU9 and pMEU10 remain important shuttle vectors for clonal selection by an insertional inactivation method.
TI  - Directed genomic integration, gene replacement, and integrative gene expression in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Several pGEM5- and pUC19-derived plasmids containing a selectable erythromycin resistance marker were integrated into the chromosome of Streptococcus thermophilus at the loci of the lactose-metabolizing genes. Integration occurred via homologous recombination and resulted in cointegrates between plasmid and genome, flanked by the homologous DNA used for integration. Selective pressure on the plasmid-located erythromycin resistance gene resulted in multiple amplifications of the integrated plasmid. Release of this selective pressure, however, gave way to homologous resolution of the cointegrate structures. By integration and subsequent resolution, we were able to replace the chromosomal lacZ gene with a modified copy carrying an in vitro-generated deletion. In the same way, we integrated a promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) gene between the chromosomal lacS and lacZ genes of the lactose operon. The inserted cat gene became a functional part of the operon and was expressed and regulated accordingly. Selective pressure on the essential lacS and lacZ genes under normal growth conditions in milk ensures the maintenance and expression of the integrated gene. As there are only minimal repeated DNA sequences (an NdeI site) flanking the inserted cat gene, it was stably maintained even in the absence of lactose, i.e., when grown on sucrose or glucose. The methodology represents a stable system in which to express and regulate foreign genes in S. thermophilus, which could qualify in the future for an application with food.
TI  - Biotyping of Streptococcus thermophilus strains by DNA fingerprinting.
AB  - DNA of 33 strains of Streptococcus thermophilus (7 isolated from natural whey cultures utilized as starter, 25 from commercial yogurts and 1 reference strain) was analysed by restriction endonuclease digestion and both conventional and pulsed-field agarose gel electrophoresis. The restriction patterns after digestion of total DNA with HindIII, EcoRI and BamHI enabled 10 different groups to be distinguished by conventional electrophoresis. Digesting genomic DNA with SmaI or NotI and separating it by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, the 33 strains could be classified into 5 groups. The same result was obtained after digestion with HaeIII and conventional electrophoresis. The 33 isolates could be divided into 13 groups when diversities among patterns obtained after both the first and second method were considered. A combination of the two techniques turned out to be the most reliable methodological approach for characterizing strains of S. thermophilus for scientific, industrial and legal purposes.
TI  - Effects of transgalactosylated disaccharides on the human intestinal microflora and their metabolism.
AB  - The effects of transgalactosylated disaccharide (TD) intake on human fecal microflora and their metabolism were investigated in 12 Japanese males. TD is a mixture of sugars, galactosyl galactose, and galactosyl glucose, synthesized from lactose through the transgalactosylation reaction of Streptococcus thermophilus beta-galactosidase. Volunteers took 15 g of the test sugar daily for 6 days. The TD ingestion increased the number of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, but decreased the number of Bacteroidaceae and Candida spp. in the feces. The ratio of bifidobacteria to total bacteria increased from 0.28 to 0.51. TD decreased the fecal concentrations of propionic acid, isobutyric acid, isovaleric acid, and valeric acid. This sugar also lowered the fecal pH, and the concentrations of fecal ammonia, p-cresol, and indole. Moreover, a positive correlation was found between the concentration of ammonia, and that of branched-chain fatty acids (isobutyric acid and isovaleric acid), p-cresol, and indole. All of these compounds are produced from amino acids through deamination by the intestinal bacteria. The depression of amino acid fermentation by intestinal bacteria may be involved in the reduction of fecal ammonia. These results suggest that a part of the transgalactosylated disaccharides passes into the colon, inducing changes in the colonic microflora composition, hastening carbohydrate fermentation, and depressing amino acid fermentation in the human gut.
TI  - Restriction/modification in Streptococcus thermophilus: isolation and characterization of a type II restriction endonuclease Sth455I.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus strain CNRZ 455 produces a type II restriction endonuclease designated Sth455I. This enzyme was isolated from cell extracts by anionic and cationic exchange chromatography. This yielded an enzyme preparation free of non-specific nucleases. The optimal reaction conditions for Sth455I are: MgCl2, 30 mM; pH range, 8-9; incubation temperature, 37-42 degrees C; and a high NaCl concentration, 100-200 mM. The results of single- and double-digestion experiments indicates that Sth455I is an isoschizomer of BstNI and EcoRII showing different sensitivity to methylation. The enzyme exhibits restriction activity on the DNA of three bacteriophages of S. thermophilus and no activity on the phage lytic for strain CNRZ 455. The restriction/modification system associated with this strain is discussed.
TI  - Purification, cloning, and cofactor independence of glutamate racemase from Lactobacillus.
AB  - Glutamate racemase has been purified more than 12,000-fold from Lactobacillus fermenti. The racemase gene has been cloned using standard hybridization techniques combined with a novel selection for in vivo glutamate racemase activity, and the racemase has been expressed in Escherichia coli as 20-25% of the total soluble cell protein. The cloned gene product is indistinguishable from that purified from Lactobacillus and is a monomer of M(r) 28,300. Both a coupled enzymatic assay and a circular dichroism assay show that the enzyme follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with a Km of 0.3 mM and a kcat of 70 s-1 in each reaction direction. Investigations into the cofactor dependence of glutamate racemase indicate that the enzyme employs neither pyridoxal phosphate nor a pyruvoyl group in the labilization of the proton at the stereogenic center of glutamate. Furthermore, the racemase activity is unaffected by the presence of the metal-chelating reagent EDTA. The gene sequence of the racemase is 24% identical to that of aspartate racemase from Streptococcus thermophilus and 30% identical to that of an unidentified open reading frame in the rrnB ribosomal RNA operon of E. coli. Because the two cysteine residues in glutamate racemase and their surrounding regions are well-conserved in both of these sequences, and since glutamate racemase is stabilized by the presence of reduced thiols, these residues are possible candidates for the enzymic bases that deprotonate glutamate at C-2.
TI  - Characterization of a Cell Envelope-Associated Proteinase Activity from Streptococcus thermophilus H-Strains.
AB  - The production and biochemical properties of cell envelope-associated proteinases from two strains of Streptococcus thermophilus (strains CNRZ 385 and CNRZ 703) were compared. No significant difference in proteinase activity was found for strain CNRZ 385 when cells were grown in skim milk medium and M17 broth. Strain CNRZ 703 exhibited a threefold-higher proteinase activity when cells were grown in low-heat skim milk medium than when grown in M17 broth. Forty-one percent of the total activity of CNRZ 385 was localized on the cell wall. The optimum pH for enzymatic activity at 37 degrees C was around 7.0. Serine proteinase inhibitors, such as phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and diisopropylfluorophosphate, inhibited the enzyme activity in both strains. The divalents cations Ca, Mg, and Mn were activators, while Zn and Cu were inhibitors. beta-Casein was hydrolyzed more rapidly than alpha(s1)-casein. The results of DNA hybridization and immunoblot studies suggested that the S. thermophilus cell wall proteinase and the lactococcal proteinase are not closely related.
TI  - Antigenotoxic properties of lactic acid bacteria in the S. typhimurium mutagenicity assay.
AB  - A high percentage of human tumors is reported to be related to dietary habits. One way to improve the nutritional impact is to increase the intake of protective factors, such as inhibitors of DNA damage and other types of anticarcinogens. Specific strains of lactic acid bacteria used to ferment milk are promising candidates that may be antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic. We have studied the antimutagenicity of 10 isolated strains of beneficial lactic acid bacteria. Four types of fermented milk products were also studied for their protective properties. The effect of these bacteria on the yield of revertants induced by nitrosated beef extract was investigated in the Salmonella typhimurium mutagenicity assay. Eight of 10 isolated Lactobacillus strains reduced the yield of his+ revertants almost back to the levels of the untreated controls. Different fermented fresh yogurts containing viable bacteria (probably Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus or Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacteria) showed protective effects as well. The degree of suppressing revertants was independent of the yogurt's fat content. In contrast, yogurt products that had been heat treated were not inhibitory. The other fresh fermented milk products (e.g., buttermilk, kefir, and "Dickmilch") were not antimutagenic in this study. The results imply that some bacteria used in milk processing have an antimutagenic potential and that this property is specific for the bacterial strain.
TI  - Lactose transport system of Streptococcus thermophilus. Functional reconstitution of the protein and characterization of the kinetic mechanism of transport.
AB  - The kinetic mechanism of the lactose transport system of Streptococcus thermophilus was studied in membrane vesicles fused with cytochrome c oxidase containing liposomes and in proteoliposomes in which cytochrome c oxidase was coreconstituted with the lactose transport protein. Selective manipulation of the components of the proton (and sodium) motive force indicated that both a membrane potential and a pH gradient could drive transport. The galactoside/proton stoichiometry was close to unity. Experiments which discriminate between the effects of internal pH and delta pH as driving force on galactoside/proton symport showed that the carrier is highly activated at alkaline internal pH values, which biases the transport system kinetically toward the pH component of the proton motive force. Galactoside efflux increased with increasing pH with a pKa of about 8, whereas galactoside exchange (and counterflow) exhibited a pH optimum around 7 with pKa values of 6 and 8, respectively. Imposition of delta pH (interior alkaline) retarded the rate of efflux at any pH value tested, whereas the rate of exchange was stimulated by an imposed delta pH at pH 5.8, not affected at pH 7.0, and inhibited at pH 8.0 and 9.0. The results have been evaluated in terms of random and ordered association/dissociation of galactoside and proton on the inner surface of the membrane. Imposition of delta psi (interior negative) decreased the rate of efflux but had no effect on the rate of exchange, indicating that the unloaded transport protein carries a net negative charge and that during exchange and counterflow the carrier recycles in the protonated form.
TI  - Effects of bacterial inoculation of high-moisture ear corn on its aerobic stability, digestion, and utilization for growth by beef steers.
AB  - High-moisture ear corn (HMEC) was treated with specific bacterial inoculants and  evaluated for its aerobic stability and utilization for growth by beef steers. Immediately after harvest, HMEC (65% DM) was ensiled in tower silos after being either untreated (control) or treated with the following inoculants: 1) Ecosyl (E); 2) Ecosyl plus Serratia rubidaea (E + SR); and 3) Ecosyl plus Streptococcus thermophilus (E + ST). A portion of HMEC was frozen immediately (-20 degrees C) and subsequently treated with eight bacterial inoculants before ensiling in laboratory silos; the fermented material was then exposed to air for 7 d for assessment of aerobic deterioration. The eight inoculants included the three used in the tower silos and four additional ones: Streptococcus thermophilus, Bacillus subtilis (BS), Serratia rubidaea, and a mixture of Ecosyl + B. subtilis (E + BS). The growth trial was conducted for 112 d with 32 crossbred steers (average BW 296 kg). A digestion trial was conducted, according to a 4 x 4 Latin square design, using an additional four steers (average BW 367 kg). In both trials, steers were fed the same four diets containing inoculated (E, E + SR, and E + ST) or control HMEC. Upon exposure to air, Ecosyl-treated ensiled HMEC had the least increase in pH compared with other single inoculants; all inoculant treatments lessened (P less than .05) the increase in sample temperature compared with control. During aerobic exposure, treatment of HMEC with BS seemed to reduce the disappearance of water-soluble carbohydrates, whereas Ecosyl seemed to reduce lactic acid. Despite evidence of improved aerobic stability with Ecosyl and BS, inoculation of HMEC did not (P greater than .10) improve BW gain or feed efficiency; however, all inoculants reduced (P less than .05) digestibility of ADF.
TI  - Properties of aspartate racemase, a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-independent amino acid racemase.
AB  - Aspartate racemase from Streptococcus thermophilus contains no pyridoxal 5'-phosphate or other cofactors such as FAD, NAD+, and metal ions. It was affected by neither carbonyl reagents such as hydroxylamine nor sodium borohydride but was strongly inhibited by iodoacetamide and other thiol reagents. Aspartate, cysteate, and cysteine sulfinate were the only substrates. The Km values for L- and D-aspartate were 35 and 8.7 mM, respectively. The enzyme catalyzed the exchange of alpha-hydrogen of the substrate with the solvent hydrogen. Racemization of L-aspartate in 2H2O showed an overshooting in the optical rotation of aspartate before the substrate was fully racemized. This shows that the removal of alpha-hydrogen of the substrate is at least partially rate-determining. When L- or D-aspartate was incubated with aspartate racemase in tritiated water, tritium was incorporated preferentially into the product enantiomer. The results strongly suggest that aspartate racemase contains two hydrogen acceptors.
TI  - Sequencing and characterization of pST1, a cryptic plasmid from Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Eighty-six strains of S. thermophilus were examined for their plasmid content. Thirteen strains were found to contain one or two plasmids ranging in size from 2.1 to 7.4 kb. DNA-DNA hybridization analysis revealed the presence of five distinct groups of DNA homology. The complete nucleotide sequence of plasmid pST1 (Accession number X65856), which belongs to the major homology group, was determined. It has a molecular size of 2093 bp, a GC content of 35% and contains one major open reading frame of 945 bp (ORF A). The predicted protein, designated Rep A, showed sequence homology with replication proteins from a group of plasmids which are known to replicate via single-stranded DNA intermediates (ssDNA plasmids).
TI  - A general method for cloning recA genes of gram-positive bacteria by polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - An internal fragment of the recA gene from eight gram-positive organisms has been amplified by using degenerate primers in a polymerase chain reaction. The internal 348- or 360-bp recA DNA segments from Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium acetobutylicum, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Leuconostoc mesanteroides, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus salivarus subsp. thermophilus were amplified, cloned, and sequenced. The G + C contents of the DNA from these species range from 28 to 52%. The sequences of the bacterial recA genes show strong relatedness. This method is particularly useful for the recovery of the recA genes of gram-positive bacteria and avoids the difficulties of using a genetic complementation test for cloning.
TI  - Different bacteriophage resistance mechanisms in Streptococcus salivarius subsp.  thermophilus.
AB  - Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus strain NST5 exhibited a temperature-dependent defence mechanism against the virulent bacteriophages phi B1.2 and phi A1.1. It was active at 42 degrees C but not at 30 degrees C as demonstrated by a significant increase of both plaque size and efficiency of plaquing. This defence mechanism did not affect host-dependent phage replication and did not interfere with phage adsorption to NST5. These results suggest that it interfered with phage development. The phages phi T33, phi T58, phi D1, phi T21 and phi T9, belonging to the same phage type as phi B1.2, were examined for their ability to infect NST3 and NST5. Restriction modification systems of different specificity were detected in NST3 and NST5; host-dependent phage replication was detected at 30 and 42 degrees C; an abortive defence mechanism was detected in NST5 which was active at 42 degrees C, but not 30 degrees C, and was independent of restriction modification action or interference with phage adsorption. Our investigations of phage-host interactions showed that the two Str. salivarius subsp. thermophilus strains studied avoided attack by related bacteriophages by evolving at least three different resistance systems.
TI  - Construction and characterization of shuttle plasmids for lactic acid bacteria and Escherichia coli.
AB  - The chimeric plasmid pBN183 was first constructed in Escherichia coli by ligating the BamHI-digested E. coli plasmid pBR322 and a Bg/II-linearized streptococcal plasmid, pNZ18. The pBN183 transformed E. coli to ApR at a frequency of (8.2 +/- 1.2) x 10(5) colony forming units (CFU)/microgram DNA. Electrotransformation of Streptococcus thermophilus with pBN183 yielded CmR, ApS clones at a frequency of (2.6 +/- 0.3) x 10(1) CFU/microgram DNA. Plasmid screening with pBN183-transformed S. thermophilus clones revealed that ca. 70% of these transformants contained deleted plasmids. Plasmid pBN183A, a pBN183 deletion mutant lacking one copy of a tandemly arranged, highly homologous DNA sequence, was isolated for further study. It transformed E. coli to ApR and S. thermophilus to CmR with frequencies of (4.8 +/- 0.1) x 10(5) and (8.1 +/- 0.2) x 10(2) CFU/microgram DNA, respectively. Screening of S. thermophilus transformants did not show the presence of deleted plasmids. Based on the structure of pBN183A, a new shuttle plasmid, pDBN183, was constructed from pBN183 by removal of the small (1.2 kb) Sa/I fragment. Transformation frequencies of pDBN183 were (5.0 +/- 1.3) x 10(5) and (4.6 +/- 0.2) x 10(2) CFU/microgram DNA with E. coli and S. thermophilus, respectively. In contrast to the parent pBN183, only 17% of the pDBN183-transformed S. thermophilus contained deleted plasmids. Plasmid copy numbers of the three vectors in E. coli were estimated at 17-18 per chromosome. The three plasmids conferred ApR and CmR to E. coli, but only CmR to S. thermophilus. The insertion of a Streptomyces cholesterol oxidase gene (choA) into pDBN183 did not affect the plasmid's stability in Lactobacillus casei, but resulted in deletion of the recombinant DNA in S. thermophilus.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the melB gene encoding the melibiose permease of Salmonella typhimurium LT2.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the melB gene coding for the Na+ (Li+)/melibiose symporter of Salmonella typhimurium LT2 was determined, and its amino acid sequence was deduced. It consists of 1428 bp, corresponding to a protein of 476 amino acid residues (calculated molecular weight 52,800). The amino acid sequence is homologous to that of the melibiose permease of Escherichia coli K12, with 85% identical residues. All, except one, of the amino acid residues that have been reported to be important for cation or substrate recognition in the melibiose permease of E. coli are conserved in the melibiose permease of S. typhimurium. In addition, part of the sequence resembles the lactose permease of Streptococcus thermophilus, the animal glucose transporter (GLUT1), the plasmid-coded raffinose permease (RafB), and the NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain 4 (Nuo4) of Aspergillus amstelodami.
TI  - The 23S-5S spacer of two rRNA loci of Streptococcus salivarius subsp thermophilus includes a promoter.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the 3' part of a ribosomal and transfer RNA locus from Streptococcus salivarius subsp thermophilus NST1403 was determined. The sequenced DNA fragment includes the 3' end of a 23S rRNA gene, a 5S rRNA gene, a tRNA(asn) gene and a potential transcriptional terminator. The tRNA gene does not encode for the CCA 3'terminus of mature tRNA. We compared this sequence to a promoter-carrying DNA fragment sequence (P20) of Streptococcus salivarius subsp thermophilus A054 [1]. We found that the P20 sequence included the 3' end of a 23S rRNA gene, a 5S rRNA gene and the 5' part of a tRNA(val) gene. The two 23S-5S spacer sequences are identical and contain a promoter and a potential 23S rRNA processing site. Therefore, 5S rRNA and tRNA genes could be transcribed from a promoter located within the 23S-5S spacer of at least two of the six rRNA loci.
TI  - Lactose transport system of Streptococcus thermophilus. The role of histidine residues.
AB  - The lactose transport protein (LacS) of Streptococcus thermophilus is a chimeric  protein consisting of an amino-terminal carrier domain and a carboxyl-terminal phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) IIA protein domain. The histidine residues of LacS were changed individually into glutamine or arginine residues. Of the 11 histidine residues present in LacS, only the His-376 substitution in the carrier domain significantly affected sugar transport. The region around His-376 was found to exhibit sequence similarity to the region around His-322 of the lactose transport protein (LacY) of Escherichia coli, which has been implicated in sugar binding and in coupling of sugar and H+ transport. The H376Q mutation resulted in a reduced rate of uptake and altered affinity for lactose (beta-galactoside), melibiose (alpha-galactoside), and the lactose analog methyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside. Similarly, the extent of accumulation of the galactosides by cells expressing LacS(H376Q) was highly reduced in comparison to cells bearing the wild-type protein. Nonequilibrium exchange of lactose and methyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside by the H376Q mutant was approximately 2-fold reduced in comparison to the activity of the wild-type transport protein. The data indicate that His-376 is involved in sugar recognition and is important, but not essential, for the cotransport of protons and galactosides. The carboxyl-terminal domain of LacS contains 2 histidine residues (His-537 and His-552) that are conserved in seven homologous IIA protein(s) (domains) of PTSs. P-enolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation of wild-type LacS, but not of the mutant H552Q, was demonstrated using purified Enzyme I and HPr, the general energy coupling proteins of the PTS, and inside-out membrane vesicles isolated from E. coli in which the lactose transport gene was expressed. The His-537 and His-552 mutations did not affect transport activity when the corresponding genes were expressed in E. coli.
TI  - Lithium chloride-sodium propionate agar for the enumeration of bifidobacteria in  fermented dairy products.
AB  - Lithium chloride-sodium propionate agar has been developed for the enumeration of bifidobacteria in fermented dairy products. The medium contains lithium chloride and sodium propionate to inhibit the growth of other lactic acid bacteria. Pure cultures of bifidobacteria, lactobacilli, and streptococci were tested for growth in this medium. With one exception, all bifidobacteria were able to grow in this medium and in a nonselective agar with a difference not exceeding .4 log units. However, none of the lactobacilli tested and only one strain each of Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris grew in lithium chloride-sodium propionate agar. In those cases, the numbers of colonies were lower in lithium chloride-sodium propionate agar by 1.26 and 2.51 log units, respectively, compared with a nonselective agar. Bifidobacteria were also selectively isolated from all fermented milks and cheeses analyzed.
TI  - Purification and partial characterization of an intracellular aminopeptidase from Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus strain ACA-DC 114.
AB  - An intracellular aminopeptidase from Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus strain ACA-DC 114, isolated from traditional Greek yoghurt, was purified by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and Sephadex G-100. The enzyme had a molecular weight of 89,000. It was active over a pH range 4.5-9.5 and had optimum activity on L-lysyl-4-nitroanilide at pH 6.5 and 35 degrees C with Km = 1.80 mmol/l; above 55 degrees C the enzyme activity declined rapidly. The aminopeptidase was capable of degrading substrates by hydrolysis of the N-terminal amino acid; it had very low endopeptidase and no carboxypeptidase activity. The enzyme was strongly inactivated by EDTA. Serine and sulphydryl group reagents had no effect on enzyme activity.
TI  - [Clinical consequences of replacing milk with yogurt in persistent infantile diarrhea].
AB  - Persistent diarrhea is an episode of diarrhea that begins acutely but lasts longer than expected for this usually self-limited disease. Treatment of this ill-defined syndrome is not well standardized but immediate intervention is required to minimize the risk of malnutrition with its various consequences. This randomized clinical trial was undertaken to evaluate the clinical efficacy of substituting yogurt for milk, as the only treatment. After a one to two-day observation period during which a standard milk diet was given, 78 children aged 3 to 36 months with confirmed persistent diarrhea of more than 15 days but less than one month duration and negative tests for fecal blood were fed either milk (infant formula) or yogurt (infant formula fermented with Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus). At inclusion both groups were comparable for age, nutritional status, diarrhea, and lactose hydrogen breath test results. Clinical treatment failure (weight loss greater than 5% in one day or persistent diarrhea after 5 days) was significantly less common in children fed yogurt (15 +/- 6%) than in children fed milk (45 +/- 8%). The beneficial effects of feeding yogurt were apparent within 48 hours in 67 +/- 8% of infants. In conclusion, these data confirm the clinical efficacy of substituting yogurt for milk in young children with persistent diarrhea. They also suggest that yogurt may be a good alternative for the initial treatment of persistent diarrhea.
TI  - Evidence and characterization of temperate bacteriophage in Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus St18.
AB  - Lysogenic strains of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus were studied using induction with mitomycin C (MC). The induction and presence of temperate phage were investigated carrying out tests on sensitive strains, electron microscopy and phage DNA analysis. Forty-five Str. salivarius subsp. thermophilus strains were subjected to induction with MC and growth of the various cultures was evaluated. Only one strain of those tested showed lysis after adding MC, thus indicating a possible lysogenic state, 0.5 micrograms MC/ml being the optimal dose. Two phi 18 phage-sensitive strains out of 45 were isolated in which this phage behaved as virulent, causing lysis of the culture in broth, but no lysis plaques on agar medium were detected. The St18 strain was cured by u.v. irradiation but no mutants sensitive to the phi 18 phage were found among the clones non-inducible by MC. The presence of phages having a hexagonal isometric head and a long non-contractile tail in the lysate obtained after inducing the St18 strain was confirmed by examination under the electron microscope. Study of the phage DNA showed a genome size of 40.9 +/- 0.5 kb without cohesive end fragments. In addition, the restriction map of the phage genome was constructed. This study has demonstrated lysogeny in Str. salivarius subsp. thermophilus and also that several phage infections of Str. salivarius subsp. thermophilus starters may have an 'endogenous' origin.
TI  - Detection of propionic acid bacteria in cheese.
AB  - Mesophilic lactic starters and thermophilic lactobacilli but not Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus grew on the sodium lactate agar (SLA) used for estimating the numbers of propionic acid bacteria (PAB) in cheese. The addition of cloxacillin (4 micrograms/ml) to SLA inhibited the starter bacteria but had no effect on the PAB. It was possible to count low numbers of PAB in the presence of high numbers of starter bacteria. A correlation coefficient of 0.9 was obtained between the level of propionic acid and the counts of PAB in cheese (n = 40). A disadvantage of the medium is that other bacteria found in cheese (mesophilic lactobacilli, enterococci, Clostridium tyrobutyricum) also grow on it; however, these bacteria are easily distinguishable from PAB on the basis of size, colour and absence of catalase.
TI  - Detection of intraspecific DNA polymorphism in Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus by a homologous rDNA probe.
AB  - Three ribosomal probes from Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus were cloned. Sequence data demonstrate that their juxtaposition corresponds to an entire operon. They were used in order to study ribosomal operon number and organization. rRNA genes were shown to be clustered in the order 5'-16S-23S-5S-3' and the number of rrn loci to vary within the subspecies. The smallest of the 3 probes was used for strain characterization. Substantial variability in hybridization patterns was observed among strains, resulting not only from, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) but also from the variability of ribosomal operon number.
TI  - Strains and species of lactic acid bacteria in fermented milks (yogurts): effect  on in vivo lactose digestion.
AB  - Lactose in yogurt with live bacteria is better tolerated than lactose in other dairy foods, partly because of the activity of microbial beta-galactosidase (beta-gal), which digests lactose in vivo. To evaluate the ability of different strains and species of lactic acid bacteria to digest lactose in vivo, yogurts (containing mixtures of strains of Streptococcus salivarius subsp thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus) and fermented milks (containing individual species of S thermophilus, L bulgaricus, L acidophilus, or Bifidobacterium bifidus) that varied in microbial beta-gal activity were produced. Selected products were fed to healthy people who cannot digest lactose, and breath hydrogen production was monitored. All yogurts dramatically and similarly improved lactose digestion, regardless of their total or specific beta-gal activity. The response to fermented milks varied from marginal improvement with B bifidus milk to nearly complete lactose digestion with L bulgaricus milk. The results suggest that total beta-gal was not the limiting factor in promoting lactose digestion, perhaps because of a limited rate of intracellular substrate transport.
TI  - Purification, properties, and sequence specificity of SslI, a new type II restriction endonuclease from Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus.
AB  - SslI, a type II restriction endonuclease, was purified from Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus strain BSN 45. SslI is an isoschizomer of BstNI. SslI activity was maximum at pH 8.8, 0 to 50 mM NaCl, 2 to 8 mM Mg2+, and 42 degrees C. Activity against phage DNA in vitro was demonstrated.
TI  - Purification and characterization of an endopeptidase from Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris Wg2.
AB  - An endopeptidase has been purified to homogeneity from a crude cell extract of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris Wg2 by a procedure that includes diethyl-aminoethane-Sephacel chromatography, phenyl-Sepharose chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, and fast protein liquid chromatography over an anion-exchange column and a hydrophobic-interaction column. Gel filtration and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated a molecular mass of the purified enzyme of 70,000 Da. The endopeptidase can degrade several oligopeptides into various tetra-, tri-, and dipeptides. The endopeptidase has no aminopeptidase, carboxypeptidase, dipeptidase, or tripeptidase activity. It is optimally active at pH 6.0 to 6.5 and in the temperature range of 30 to 38 degrees C. The enzyme is inactivated by the chemical agents 1,10-phenanthroline, ethylenedinitrilotetraacetate, beta-mercaptoethanol, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and is inhibited by Cu2+ and Zn2+. The ethylenedinitrilotetraacetate- or 1,10-phenanthroline-treated enzyme can be reactivated by Co2+. Immunoblotting with specific antibodies raised against the purified endopeptidase indicated that the enzyme is also present in other Lactococcus spp., as well as in Lactobacillus spp. and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus.
TI  - Diffusion of lactose in kappa-carrageenan/locust bean gum gel beads with or without entrapped growing lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Effective diffusion coefficients (De) of lactose in kappa-carrageenan (2.75% wt/wt)/locust bean gum (0.25% wt/wt) (LBG) gel beads (1.5-2.0-mm diameter)with or without entrapped lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were determined at 40 degrees C. The effects of lactose concentration, bacteria strain (Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei) and cell content at various steps of the fermentation process (after immobilization, pre-incubation of the beads and successive fermentations) were measured on De as a first step for process modelling. Results were obtained from transiend concentration changes n well-stirred lactose solutions in which the beads were suspended. A mathematical model of unsteady-state diffusion in a sphere was used, and De was obtained from the best fit of the experimental data. Diffusivity of lactose in cell-tree beads was significantly lower than in pure water mainly because of the obstruction effect of the polymer chains and the hydration region. Furthermore, effective diffusivity and equilibrium partition factor were independent of lactose concentration in the range from 12.5 to 50 g/L. No significant difference was found for De (effective diffusivity) and Kp (partition) coefficients between beads entrapping S. thermophilus (approximately 5 x 10(9) CFU/mL) and cell-free beads. On the other hand higher cell counts obtained with L. casei (close to 1.8 x 10(11) CFU/mL) increased mass transfer resistance resulting in lower effective diffusivities and Kp. Finally, the effects of the type of bacteria and their distribution in the beads on the diffusivity were also discussed.
TI  - Ultrasound treatment for harvesting an aminopeptidase from lactic Acid bacteria and quantitation of the enzyme by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.
AB  - Ultrasound treatment of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris AM2 was optimized to release a maximum amount of intracellular aminopeptidase without modifying the antigenicity of the enzyme. The cells were sonicated three times for 30 s at 23 W. Antibodies produced against the aminopeptidase purified from L. lactis subsp. cremoris AM2 enabled us to use immunoblotting to detect the enzyme in the lysates of all of the lactococci tested but not in the lysates of Leuconostoc strains, lactobacilli, and Streptococcus salivarus subsp. thermophilus. A sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed to quantify the purified aminopeptidase; the detection limit was 4 ng/ml. The aminopeptidase in the supernatant obtained after the ultrasound treatment of strain AM2 cells was detected with the ELISA starting with a total protein concentration of 200 ng/ml. The proportion of equivalent purified aminopeptidase in the supernatant of L. lactis subsp. cremoris AM2 was about 2% of the total protein. Similarly, the aminopeptidase was quantified in different lactococci; the percentages varied between 0.16 and 2%, depending on the strain. The aminopeptidase content in a mixture of several lactic bacteria was also determined with the sandwich ELISA.
TI  - Changes in chemical composition and sensory qualities of peanut milk fermented with lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The effects of fermentation of aqueous extracts of peanuts (peanut milk) with Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus, separately and in combination, on selected chemical and sensory qualities were investigated. Changes in pH, titratable acidity and viable cell populations indicated that there was a synergistic interaction between L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and S. salivarius ssp. thermophilus during fermentation. Analysis of headspace volatiles revealed that hexanal, which is one of the compounds responsible for undesirable green/beany flavor in peanut milk, completely disappeared as a result of fermentation. S. salivarius ssp. thermophilus was more effective than L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus in reducing the hexanal content. The acetaldehyde content of peanut milk increased during fermentation. Changes in concentrations of these volatile compounds were correlated with sensory evaluation scores which showed that a significant (P less than or equal to 0.05) decrease in green/beany flavor and a significant increase in creamy flavor occurred as a result of fermentation.
TI  - Interferon induction by Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus in mice.
AB  - This study investigates the effect of intraperitoneal injection of L. bulgaricus  and S. thermophilus on interferon production by Swiss mice. The serum from mice given 5 x 10(7) L. bulgaricus in 0.5 ml saline showed a maximal production of 300 U/ml of alpha/beta interferon activity six hours after injection. Cellular integrity appears to be necessary for stimulation; heat-treated bacteria had little effect, while irradiated-bacteria had a greater effect. TNF was also produced, the sera of mice with high IFN also contained 300 U/ml TNF. Streptococcus thermophilus produced no detectable increase in serum IFN, but the 2'-5' A synthetase activity of peritoneal cells was elevated suggesting that small amounts of interferon were produced. Injection of Streptococcus thermophilus plus Lactobacillus bulgaricus did not change the serum interferon response to L. bulgaricus. These observations suggest that non-pathogenic bacteria such as those used in food processing, can stimulate IFN production in mice. There is some evidence that the bacterial cell walls might be responsible for at least part of this effect.
TI  - Distribution and purification of aspartate racemase in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The distribution of aspartate racemase (EC 5.1.1.13) in various kinds of bacteria demonstrated that the enzyme occurs in lactic acid bacteria, such as Streptococcus species and Lactobacillus species. The enzyme from Streptococcus thermophilus IAM10064 was more thermostable than that from Streptococcus lactis IAM1198 which contained the enzyme most abundantly among the lactic acid bacteria we examined here. We purified the enzyme about 3400-fold to homogeneity from cell-free extract of S. thermophilus, which is composed of two identical subunits with a molecular weight of 28,000 as a homodimer. The enzyme utilizes specifically aspartate as a substrate, but not alanine and glutamate. Maximal reaction velocity was observed at 37 degrees C and around pH 8.0. The sequence of the NH2-terminal amino acids of the enzyme was determined to be Met-Glu-Asn-Phe-Phe-Ser-Ile-Leu-Gly-XXX-Met-Gly-Thr-Met-Ala-Thr-Glu-Ser- Phe-.
TI  - Galactose utilization in Lactobacillus helveticus: isolation and characterization of the galactokinase (galK) and galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (galT) genes.
AB  - By complementing appropriate gal lesions in Escherichia coli K802, we were able to isolate the galactokinase (galK) and galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (galT) genes of Lactobacillus helveticus. Tn10 transposon mutagenesis, together with in vivo complementation analysis and in vitro enzyme activity measurements, allowed us to map these two genes. The DNA sequences of the genes and the flanking regions were determined. These revealed that the two genes are organized in the order galK-galT in an operonlike structure. In an in vitro transcription-translation assay, the galK and galT gene products were identified as 44- and 53-kDa proteins, respectively, data which corresponded well with the DNA sequencing data. The deduced amino acid sequence of the galK gene product showed significant homologies to other prokaryotic and eukaryotic galactokinase sequences, whereas galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase did not show any sequence similarities to other known proteins. This observation, together with a comparison of known gal operon structures, suggested that the L. helveticus operon developed independently to a translational expression unit having a different gene order than that in E. coli, Streptococcus lividans, or Saccharomyces cerevisiae. DNA sequencing of the flanking regions revealed an open reading frame downstream of the galKT operon. It was tentatively identified as galM (mutarotase) on the basis of the significant amino acid sequence homology with the corresponding Streptococcus thermophilus gene.
TI  - A species-specific DNA probe obtained from Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus detects strain restriction polymorphism.
AB  - Genomic polymorphism in Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus was revealed by DNA restriction pattern analysis. A 4.2-kb variable DNA fragment was cloned from strain NST7 and hybridised with the DNA of 25 strains allowing an easy detection of intraspecific RFLP. Strong and weak hybridisation signals were observed and the latter were specifically revealed by a 2.1-kb fragment of the probe. Probe specificity was demonstrated by the absence of homology with DNA of strains belonging to 10 other species, with the exception of S. salivarius subsp. salivarius, confirming a close relationship between S. salivarius and S. thermophilus.
TI  - Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequencing of the aspartate racemase gene from lactic acid bacteria Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The gene coding aspartate racemase (EC 5.1.1.13) was cloned from the lactic acid  bacteria Streptococcus thermophilus IAM10064 and expressed efficiently in Escherichia coli. The 2.1 kilobase pairs long full length clone had an open reading frame of 729 nucleotides coding for 243 amino acids. The calculated molecular weight of 27,945 agreed well with the apparent molecular weight of 28,000 found in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the aspartate racemase purified from S. thermophilus. The N-terminal amino acid sequence from the purified protein exactly matches the derived sequence. In addition, the amino acid composition compiled from the derived sequence is very similar to that obtained from the purified recombinant protein. No significantly homologous proteins were found in a protein sequence data bank. Even the homology scores with alanine racemases of Salmonella typhimurium and Bacillus stearothermophilus were low. Aspartate racemase was overproduced in Escherichia coli NM522 with plasmid pAG6-2-7, which was constructed from two copies of the gene linked with a tac promoter and plasmid vector pUC18. The amount of aspartate racemase increases with the growth of E. coli and almost no degradation of the enzyme was observed. The maximum amount of the produced enzyme reached approx. 20% of the total protein of E. coli.
TI  - Influence of pH, temperature, and inoculum composition on mixed cultures of Streptococcus thermophilus 404 and Lactobacillus bulgaricus 398.
AB  - The effects of pH, temperature, and inoculum composition on Streptococcus thermophilus 404 and Lactobacillus bulgaricus 398 mixed cultures were studied. Linear quadratic models according to these three variables were proposed to express the growth and acidification characteristics, as well as the final proportion between the two strains. Initial and operating conditions, allowing maximization of these characteristics were determined. Finally, a graphic method to predict both final total concentration and final proportion of the two bacteria as a function of pH, temperature and inoculum composition is presented.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of chromosomal promoters of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus.
AB  - A promoter probe vector, pTG244, was constructed with the aim of isolating transcription initiation signals from Streptococcus thermophilus (Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus). pTG244 is based on the Escherichia coli-streptococcus shuttle vector pTG222, into which the promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene of Bacillus pumilus (cat-86) was cloned. Random Sau3A fragments from the S. thermophilus A054 chromosomal DNA were cloned upstream of the cat-86 gene by using E. coli as the host. The pool of recombinant plasmids were introduced into S. thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis in order to search for promoter activity in these hosts. For S. thermophilus, it was necessary to first select erythromycin-resistant transformants and then to screen for chloramphenicol resistance among these. Direct selection of chloramphenicol-resistant clones was, however, possible in L. lactis subsp. lactis. Six fragments exhibiting promoter activity were characterized in S. thermophilus by measuring the levels of cat-86 transcription and/or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase specific activity. Three of the promoter-carrying fragments were sequenced. The 5' ends of their corresponding mRNAs were determined by S1 mapping and shown to correspond to a purine residue in all cases. Upstream from these potential transcription start points, sequences homologous to the E. coli sigma 70 and the Bacillus subtilis vegetative sigma 43 (or sigma A) consensus promoters were identified.
TI  - The presence of two forms of the phosphocarrier protein HPr of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system in streptococci.
AB  - The protein, HPr, a necessary component of the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (PTS) in bacteria, was purified from Streptococcus salivarius by column chromatography. The purified preparation gave only one band when analyzed by sodium dodecylsulfate gel electrophoresis or by isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gel (pI = 4.85). However, electrophoresis in Tris-containing buffers under non-denaturing conditions revealed 2 bands that could be phosphorylated by PEP in the presence of enzyme I of the PTS or by ATP with the HPr kinase. Homogeneous preparations of these 2 forms could be obtained by preparative electrophoresis. Each preparation exhibited only 1 band when analyzed by electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions, indicating that the doublet observed before preparative electrophoresis was not an electrophoretic artefact. The electrophoretic mobility of each protein was not modified following heat-treatment at 100 degrees C for 20 min or storage at -40 degrees C for several months. Both HPr proteins catalyzed in vitro the PEP-dependent phosphorylation of glucose, but at a rate slightly lower than that observed with a preparation of HPr containing both forms of the protein. Both forms were also able to transfer the phosphate group from PEP to the other specific PTS proteins known in S salivarius. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against each form reacted with both proteins. The presence of the 2 forms of HPr was detected in fresh cellular extracts of S salivarius; however, their intracellular ratio varied according to growth conditions. A doublet was also found in many other streptococcal species tested (S mutans, S sobrinus, S sanguis, S thermophilus, S bovis, S rattus) and also in L lactis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Lactose Uptake Driven by Galactose Efflux in Streptococcus thermophilus: Evidence for a Galactose-Lactose Antiporter.
AB  - Galactose-nonfermenting (Gal) Streptococcus thermophilus TS2 releases galactose into the extracellular medium when grown in medium containing excess lactose. Starved and de-energized Gal cells, however, could be loaded with galactose to levels approximately equal to the extracellular concentration (0 to 50 mM). When loaded cells were separated from the medium and resuspended in fresh broth containing 5 mM lactose, galactose efflux occurred. De-energized, galactose-loaded cells, resuspended in buffer or medium, accumulated [C]lactose at a greater rate and to significantly higher intracellular concentrations than unloaded cells. Uptake of lactose by loaded cells was inhibited more than that by unloaded cells in the presence of extracellular galactose, indicating that a galactose gradient was involved in the exchange system. When de-energized, galactose-loaded cells were resuspended in carbohydrate-free medium at pH 6.7, a proton motive force (Deltap) of 86 to 90 mV was formed, whereas de-energized, nonloaded cells maintained a Deltap of about 56 mV. However, uptake of lactose by loaded cells occurred when the proton motive force was abolished by the addition of an uncoupler or in the presence of a proton-translocating ATPase inhibitor. These results support the hypothesis that galactose efflux in GalS. thermophilus is electrogenic and that the exchange reaction (lactose uptake and galactose efflux) probably occurs via an antiporter system.
TI  - Transfer and expression of a Streptomyces cholesterol oxidase gene in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The recombinant plasmid pNCO937 (8.1 kbp) containing a Streptomyces sp. cholesterol oxidase gene was introduced into Streptococcus thermophilus by electrotransformation. Transformation frequency was 7.2 x 10(5) colony forming units/micrograms of DNA. The presence of the cholesterol oxidase gene in S. thermophilus was confirmed with Southern blot analysis using a biotinylated probe. Thin-layer chromatographic analysis showed the expression of the Streptomyces cholesterol oxidase gene resulting in the oxidation of cholesterol to 4-cholesten-3-one. S. thermophilus may be a suitable host for the expression of other genes regulating prokaryotic cholesterol metabolism.
TI  - Inhibition of Clostridium tyrobutyricum by bacteriocin-like substances produced by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria were selected for their inhibitory activity against Clostridium tyrobutyricum under conditions that eliminate the effects of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide. Four strains were isolated belonging to the species Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. The sensitivity of the inhibitory substances to pronase and trypsine indicates that they are proteins or peptides different from nisin. Their resistance to phospholipase D indicates that they are also different from lactostrepcin. The inhibitory substances are produced during the exponential phase of growth. Their activity is bactericidal and directed toward some strains of Clostridium tyrobutyricum, Lactobacillus helveticus, and Streptococcus thermophilus, but strains used as dairy starters, Lactobacillus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Propionibacterium shermanii, are not all affected by the inhibition.
TI  - [Cloning the gene of beta-galactosidase from the industrial strain of Streptococcus lactis 111 in E. coli cells and conjugated transfer of this gene to Streptococcus thermophilus cells].
AB  - The ability of the industrial strains of Streptococcus lactis to synthesize the enzyme beta-galactosidase was studied. Five strains among sixteen were found to produce high levels of the enzyme. The beta-galactosidase gene in the most active strain Streptococcus lactis 111 was shown to be located on the 50 kb conjugative plasmid. The plasmid was transferred by conjugation into Streptococcus thermophilus cells and subsequently the gene for beta-galactosidase was studied in transconjugants. The beta-galactosidase gene from Streptococcus lactis 111 was subcloned in Escherichia coli cells on the plasmid pBR322. The gene was localized on the 4.8 kb BgIII fragment of DNA. Following the restriction of DNA by the Sau3A the gene was subcloned on the birepliconed plasmid vector pCB20 capable of replication in the Gram-negative as well as Gram-positive microorganisms. The recombinant derivatives of pCB20 were isolated that carry the beta-galactosidase gene on the DNA fragments of different size.
TI  - Induction of 2'-5' A synthetase activity and interferon in humans by bacteria used in dairy products.
AB  - The production of interferon by fasted human subjects in response to lactic bacteria Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus was evaluated in vivo and in vitro. The 2'-5' A synthetase activity of blood mononuclear cells was used to estimate interferon production following a single ingestion of 10(11) bacteria in yoghurt or sterile milk (controls). The level of the 2'-5' A synthetase of the yoghurt fed subjects was 83% (p = 0.002) higher than that of the milk fed controls 24 hours after ingestion. The baseline value remained unchanged in the control group. Blood mononuclear cells from a second group of subjects, were cultured with lactic bacteria for 48 hours, their cell-free supernatants contained gamma interferon. These results suggest that a transient production of interferon can be induced in healthy subjects by the lactic bacteria used in food processing.
TI  - Lactose metabolism in Lactobacillus bulgaricus: analysis of the primary structure and expression of the genes involved.
AB  - The genes coding for the lactose permease and beta-galactosidase, two proteins involved in the metabolism of lactose by Lactobacillus bulgaricus, have been cloned, expressed, and found functional in Escherichia coli. The nucleotide sequences of these genes and their flanking regions have been determined, showing the presence of two contiguous open reading frames (ORFs). One of these ORFs codes for the lactose permease gene, and the other codes for the beta-galactosidase gene. The lactose permease gene is located in front of the beta-galactosidase gene, with 3 bp in the intergenic region. The two genes are probably transcribed as one operon. Primer extension studies have mapped a promoter upstream from the lactose permease gene but not the beta-galactosidase gene. This promoter is similar to those found in E. coli with general characteristics of GC-rich organisms. In addition, the sequences around the promoter contain a significantly higher number of AT base pairs (80%) than does the overall L. bulgaricus genome, which is rich in GC (GC content of 54%). The amino acid sequences obtained from translation of the ORFs are found to be highly homologous (similarity of 75%) to those from Streptococcus thermophilus. The first 460 amino acids of the lactose permease shows homology to the melibiose transport protein of E. coli. Little homology was found between the lactose permease of L. bulgaricus and E. coli, but the residues which are involved in the binding and the transport of lactose are conserved. The carboxy terminus is similar to that of the enzyme III of several phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase systems.
TI  - Analysis of the lacZ sequences from two Streptococcus thermophilus strains: comparison with the Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus bulgaricus beta-galactosidase sequences.
AB  - The lacZ gene from Streptococcus thermophilus A054, a commercial yogurt strain, was cloned on a 7.2 kb PstI fragment in Escherichia coli and compared with the previously cloned lacZ gene from S. thermophilus ATCC 19258. Using the dideoxy chain termination method, the DNA sequences of both lacZ structural genes were determined and found to be 3071 bp in length. When the two sequences were more closely analysed, 21 nucleotide differences were detected, of which only nine resulted in amino acid changes in the proteins, the remainder occurring in wobble positions of the respective codons. Only three bases separated the termination codon for the lacS gene from the initiation codon for lacZ, suggesting that the lactose utilization genes are organized as an operon. The amino acid sequence of the beta-galactosidase, derived from the DNA sequence, corresponds to a protein with a molecular mass of 116860 Da. Comparison of the S. thermophilus amino acid sequences with those from Lactobacillus bulgaricus, E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae showed 48, 35 and 32.5% identity respectively. Although little sequence homology was observed at the DNA level, many regions conserved in the amino acid sequence were identified when the beta-galactosidase proteins from S. thermophilus, E. coli and L. bulgaricus were compared.
TI  - Antitumor activity of Streptococcus thermophilus against fibrosarcoma: role of T-cells.
AB  - Antitumor activity induced by a heat-killed preparation of S. thermophilus against mouse fibrosarcoma was investigated. The treatment of Swiss mice with S. thermophilus prior to transplantation could not prevent tumors. However, animals cured by treatment with a S. thermophilus preparation failed to take up the tumor when rechallenged with fibrosarcoma. S. thermophilus did not induce antitumor activity in animals immunosuppressed by sublethal whole body gamma-irradiation (4 Gy) or hydrocortisone treatment prior to transplantation. Suppression of activity of macrophages by carrageenan had no effect on antitumor activity of the heat inactivated preparation of S. thermophilus. The intravenous administration of sera from cured animals was ineffective in curing the tumours. Spleen cells from cured animals could effectively transfer the antitumor activity to recipients transplanted with the tumor. This effect was abolished when the T-lymphocyte population in the inoculum was specifically depleted. The results thus suggest the involvement of T-lymphocytes in antitumor activity exhibited by S. thermophilus.
TI  - Influence of nonfermented dairy products containing bacterial starter cultures on lactose maldigestion in humans.
AB  - The effect of nonfermented dairy products containing yogurt or acidophilus cultures on lactose utilization by lactose-maldigesting humans was investigated. Yogurt and acidophilus milk containing 10(7) or 10(8) of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus, or Lactobacillus acidophilus, respectively, were prepared using commercially processed 2% low fat milk. Immediately following inoculation, products were refrigerated. Lactose maldigestion was monitored by measuring breath hydrogen excretion at hourly intervals for 8 h following consumption of 400 ml of each test meal containing approximately 20 g of lactose. The yogurt milk containing 10(8) cfu/ml was shown to contain significant concentrations of microbial beta-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23; approximately 3 U/ml), which remained stable for at least 14 d at refrigerator temperatures. Breath hydrogen peaks were delayed and significantly lower (approximately 20 ppm at 5 to 7 h) than control values (approximately 70 ppm at 4 h), and intolerance symptoms were eliminated in all subjects. Yogurt milk containing 10(7) cfu/ml demonstrated intermediate breath hydrogen values and was marginally significantly different from control values. Lactobacillus acidophilus strains with varying resistance to bile and total beta-galactosidase-producing potential were also tested. Only one strain, LA-1, which demonstrated low bile resistance and intermediate beta-galactosidase activity, was capable of significantly decreasing breath hydrogen values when 10(8) cfu/ml of milk was consumed.
TI  - Antimutagenic activity of milk fermented by Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus.
AB  - Antimutagenic activity of acetone or ethylacetate extracts of skim milk fermented by Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, or a combination of both the organisms was studied using Salmonella typhimurium (TA 98 and TA 100). Mutagens used were 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide (a direct-acting mutagen) and 2-aminofluorene (a mutagen requiring S9 activation). Extracts from all fermented milks showed significant (P less than .05) dose response in suppressing the number of revertants caused by NQNO and 2-aminofluorene in both tester strains, whereas extracts from unfermented milk had no effect. Extracts prepared from milk fermented by L. bulgaricus plus S. thermophilus showed significantly (P less than .05) more antimutagenic activity than extracts prepared from milk fermented by S. thermophilus alone. Solvent (acetone vs. ethyl acetate) effect was not significant with 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide as mutagen. However, in the case of 2-aminofluorene, acetone extracts showed significantly (P less than .05) higher antimutagenic activity. The results of this and related studies strongly indicate that antimutagenic compounds are produced in milk during fermentation by S. thermophilus and L. bulgaricus.
TI  - Characterization and comparison of virulent bacteriophages of Streptococcus thermophilus isolated from yogurt.
AB  - Seven virulent bacteriophages of Streptococcus thermophilus were characterized at the molecular level and classified into 2 subgroups (A and B) by DNA/DNA hybridization experiments and analysis of their structural proteins. Two representatives of subgroups A and B were compared to 3 representatives of Neve's subgroups I, II and III (Neve et al, 1989) by Southern blot experiments. These isometric-headed phages possess a double-stranded DNA genome varying between 30-44 kilobase (kb) pairs. Subgroup A is composed of 3 phages (phi 57 as representative) with similar structural proteins as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-poly-acrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE) electrophoresis (estimated molecular weights of 31,000 and 27,500 for phage phi 57 and 32,000 and 27,000 for the 2 others). A common structural protein of 43,000 was found for phages of subgroup B. Phages phi 57 (subgroup A) and a10/J9 or PO (Neve's subgroups I or II, respectively) belonged to the same subgroup as determined by DNA/DNA hybridization experiments. Partial DNA homology was detected among all the phages tested except for phage phi ST27 of AW Jarvis. Phage-host interactions were also investigated by cross-propagation of the 7 studied phages on different indicator strains. A complete lack of correlation existed between the DNA homology grouping of the phages and their host range. Various restriction-modification systems were detected in some of the Streptococcus thermophilus strains.
TI  - Freeze-drying of Streptococcus thermophilus: a comparison between the vacuum and  the atmospheric method.
AB  - Frozen suspensions of Streptococcus thermophilus were freeze-dried in a vacuum or a fluidized adsorbent bed at atmospheric pressure. Optimum operating conditions for each process were defined. For the duration of processing and survival rate of bacteria, in each case vacuum freeze-drying seemed more satisfactory than atmospheric pressure freeze-drying. The use of reconstituted skimmed milk as a suspension medium provides good protection for S. thermophilus.
TI  - Molecular genetics of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The metabolism and genetics of Streptococcus thermophilus (presently Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus) have only been investigated recently despite its widespread use in milk fermentation processes. The development of recombinant DNA technology has allowed impressive progress to be made in the knowledge of thermophilic dairy streptococci. In particular, it has permitted a careful analysis of phenotypically altered variants which were derived from a mother strain by plasmid or chromosomal DNA reorganization. While natural phage defense mechanisms of S. thermophilus remain poorly documented, information on the bacteriophages responsible for fermentation failures has accumulated. The lysogenic state of two S. thermophilus strains has also been demonstrated for the first time. Gene transfer techniques for this species have been established and improved to the point that targeted manipulation of their chromosomal determinants is now feasible. Cloning and expression vectors have been constructed, and a few heterologous genes were successfully expressed in S. thermophilus. The first homologous genes, involved in carbohydrate utilization, have been cloned and sequenced, shedding some light on the molecular organization of key metabolic steps.
TI  - Carbohydrate utilization in Streptococcus thermophilus: characterization of the genes for aldose 1-epimerase (mutarotase) and UDPglucose 4-epimerase.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequences of the genes encoding aldose 1-epimerase (mutarotase) (galM) and UDPglucose 4-epimerase (galE) and flanking regions of Streptococcus thermophilus have been determined. Both genes are located immediately upstream of the S. thermophilus lac operon. To facilitate the isolation of galE, a special polymerase chain reaction-based technique was used to amplify the region upstream of galM prior to cloning. The galM protein was homologous to the mutarotase of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, whereas the galE protein was homologous to UDPglucose 4-epimerase of Escherichia coli and Streptomyces lividans. The amino acid sequences of galM and galE proteins also showed significant similarity with the carboxy-terminal and amino-terminal domains, respectively, of UDPglucose 4-epimerase from Kluyveromyces lactis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, suggesting that the yeast enzymes contain an additional, yet unidentified (mutarotase) activity. In accordance with the open reading frames of the structural genes, galM and galE were expressed as polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of 39 and 37 kilodaltons, respectively. Significant activities of mutarotase and UDPglucose 4-epimerase were detected in lysates of E. coli cells containing plasmids encoding galM and galE. Expression of galE in E. coli was increased 300-fold when the gene was placed downstream of the tac promoter. The gene order for the gal-lac gene cluster of S. thermophilus is galE-galM-lacS-lacZ. The flanking regions of these genes were searched for consensus promoter sequences and further characterized by primer extension analysis. Analysis of mRNA levels for the gal and lac genes in S. thermophilus showed a strong reduction upon growth in medium containing glucose instead of lactose. The activities of the lac (lactose transport and beta-galactosidase) and gal (UDPglucose 4-epimerase) proteins of lactose- and glucose-grown S. thermophilus cells matched the mRNA levels.
TI  - Structure of an exocellular polysaccharide produced by Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus strains grown on skimmed milk produced a viscosifying, exocellular, and water-soluble polysaccharide which contains D-glucose, D-galactose, and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine in the ratio of 1:2:1. Methylation analysis identified the glycosidic linkages in the tetrasaccharidic repeating-unit, and Smith degradation and nitrous deamination after N-deacetylation gave the sequence of monosaccharides in the repeating-unit. The anomeric configurations of the sugar residues were determined by oxidation of the peracetylated polysaccharide with chromium trioxide and by 1H- and 13C-n.m.r. spectroscopy. The following structure was assigned to the repeating unit of the polysaccharide,----3)-beta-D-Galp-(1----3)-[alpha-D-Galp-(1----6)]-beta- D- Glcp-(1----3)-alpha-D-GalpNAc-(1----.
TI  - [Cloning of the Streptococcus thermophilus beta-galactosidase gene and its expression in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis cells].
AB  - The beta-galactosidase gene from the chromosome of Streptococcus thermophilus, strain 6 kb, has been cloned on a vector plasmid pBR322. The corresponding gene has been found to be located on the Pst1 DNA fragment. The restriction map of this 6 kb fragment has been constructed. The shortening of the DNA fragment carrying the beta-galactosidase gene has been achieved by digestion of the recombinant derivative of pBR322 by the restriction endonuclease Sau3A under the conditions of incomplete hydrolysis. The obtained fragments have been cloned into the BamHI site in the berepliconed shuttle vector pCB20 for grampositive and gramnegative bacteria. The obtained recombinant plasmids contained the beta-galactosidase gene in the inserted fragments of different length. Expression of the cloned beta-galactosidase gene in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis cells has been studied.
TI  - Production of bakers' yeast in cheese whey ultrafiltrate.
AB  - A process for the production of bakers' yeast in whey ultrafiltrate (WU) is described. Lactose in WU was converted to lactic acid and galactose by fermentation. Streptococcus thermophilus was selected for this purpose. Preculturing of S. thermophilus in skim milk considerably reduced its lag. Lactic fermentation in 2.3x-concentrated WU was delayed compared with that in unconcentrated whey, and fermentation could not be completed within 60 h. The growth rate of bakers' yeast in fermented WU differed among strains. The rate of galactose utilization was similar for all strains, but differences in lactic acid utilization occurred. Optimal pH ranges for galactose and lactic acid utilization were 5.5 to 6.0 and 5.0 to 5.5, respectively. The addition of 4 g of corn steep liquor per liter to fermented WU increased cell yields. Two sources of nitrogen were available for growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae: amino acids (corn steep liquor) and ammonium (added during the lactic acid fermentation). Ammonium was mostly assimilated during growth on lactic acid. This process could permit the substitution of molasses by WU for the industrial production of bakers' yeast.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a type II restriction endonuclease from Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - A type II restriction endonuclease Sth134I was isolated from Streptococcus thermophilus strain 134. The enzyme is an isoschizomer of HpaII. The restriction endonuclease is most active at Mg(II) greater than or equal to 5 mM; in the pH range of 7.5-8; temperature of 50 degrees-55 degrees C; and (KCl) or (NaCl) below 100 mM. Double digestion and ligation experiments showed that Sth134I apparently recognized and cleaves DNA at the sequence C1CGG to produce two-base, 5'-protruding ends.
TI  - Serological identification of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus.
AB  - Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus (Str. thermophilus) has no group-specific antigen. HCl extracts of 551 strains of streptococci isolated from cheese or yogurt (123 Str. thermophilus and 428 Enterococcus faecalis - Ent. faecium spp.) were examined with three type-specific antisera prepared against representatives of Str. thermophilus and also with Lancefield group D antisera. All typical (80) or atypical (43) strains of Str. thermophilus reacted with at least one type-specific antiserum and none of the enterococci reacted. Only two strains reacted with both type-specific and group antisera.
TI  - Growth kinetics of Streptococcus thermophilus at subbacteriostatic penicillin G concentrations.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus may be subjected to the effects of penicillin G in contaminated milk used for yogurt production. Sensitivity of this microorganism to penicillin G has been conventionally determined by the help of penicillin G-impregnated disks placed on solid media. It was observed that the bacteriostatic penicillin G concentration was much greater in liquid media than in solid media. The conventional disk method may not be appropriate for antibiotic sensitivity determinations if the microorganisms will be used in liquid culture. A simple mathematical model simulated the growth of S. thermophilus in liquid culture. Numerical values of this model's parameters were regarded as the measure of the antibiotic effect on the culture. In penicillin G containing fresh medium, small concentrations of antibiotic decreased the specific growth rate considerably. Increasing the antibiotic concentration caused only slight additional decline. Antibiotic shock, i.e., rapidly introducing penicillin G into an actively growing antibiotic-free culture, stopped growth of the penicillin G-resistant microorganisms, and no death was observed, but a fraction of the microorganisms were killed in the wild culture. Both the wild and the resistant cultures recovered from the shock in a few hours. Addition of penicillin G-resistant microorganisms together with the antibiotic dosage into the wild culture prevented death.
TI  - Genome comparison of Lactococcus strains by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
AB  - The two restriction enzymes SmaI and ApaI were found to produce distributions of  DNA fragments useful for genome analysis of some lactic acid bacteria (Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus) by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The genome size was estimated to be 1750 to 2500 kb depending on the species. Each strain displayed unique restriction patterns; nevertheless, the percentage of the comigrating fragments of two isogenic or closely related strains was about 80% and fell to 20-40% when the patterns of two non-related strains of the same species or two strains belonging to different species were compared.
TI  - Effect of threonine and glycine concentrations on threonine aldolase activity of  yogurt microorganisms during growth in a modified milk prepared by ultrafiltration.
AB  - To evaluate the combined effects of threonine and glycine concentrations during growth on threonine aldolase activity (EC 2.1.2.1) of yogurt microorganisms, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus, a modified milk growth medium was prepared using UF to deplete the free amino acid level. Threonine and glycine were added according to a 2x2x2 factorial design at 5 or 195 microg.ml(-1) along with a standard amino acid mixture. Acetaldehyde production and threonine aldolase activity were evaluated utilizing headspace gas chromatography. Results showed that threonine and glycine concentrations did not affect growth or titratable acidity. The high concentration of threonine in combination with low glycine in the growth medium resulted in increased acetaldehyde synthesis by both microorganisms. Conversely, high glycine with low threonine decreased acetaldehyde synthesis. High threonine and low glycine increased threonine aldolase activity of cell-free extracts from S. thermophilus and L. bulgaricus, whereas high glycine and low threonine reduced threonine aldolase activity of both microorganisms.
TI  - Purification and substrate specificity of a strongly hydrophobic extracellular metalloendopeptidase ("gelatinase") from Streptococcus faecalis (strain 0G1-10).
AB  - An extracellular Zn-endopeptidase was purified to homogeneity from the culture filtrates of Streptococcus faecalis (human oral strain 0G1-10) by a procedure that comprised concentration in an Amicon Hollow Fiber System, ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel permeation chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography (batch operation on phenyl-sepharose Cl-4B), followed by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) on a phenyl-Superose HR 5/5 column, and finally FPLC on a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column. The enzyme is a 31.5-kDa strongly hydrophobic protein with an isoelectric point of 4.6 and a broad pH optimum of 6 to 8. The substrate specificity of the enzyme is similar to that of the mammalian membrane endopeptidase-24.11 and Streptococcus thermophilus thermolysin (EC 3.4.24.4) in hydrolyzing preferentially the Phe24-Phe25 bond in insulin B-chain, followed by cleavage of the His5-Leu6 bond. The enzyme was especially active on Azocoll and gelatin; soluble and insoluble collagens were hydrolyzed at a lower rate. S. faecalis sex pheromone-related peptides and several mammalian bioactive peptides were cleaved at sites involving pronounced hydrophobicity. The enzyme did not hydrolyze small synthetic peptide derivatives (phenylazobenzyloxycarbonyl-L-Pro-L-Leu-Gly-L-Pro-D-Arg and 2-furylacryloyl-L-Leu-Gly-L-Ala) that are typically attacked by "true" bacterial collagenases. Chemical modification indicated the importance of histidyl, carboxyl, and tyrosyl groups in enzyme activity, suggesting that this enzyme may thus be classified as a metalloprotease II (EC 3.4.24.4). The enzyme is strongly inhibited by a 720-kDa factor present in rat inflammatory exudate. The pronounced ability of the enzyme to attack collagenous materials and certain bioactive peptides suggests its participation in inflammatory processes involving the presence of S. faecalis.
TI  - Uptake of glutamic acid by Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus CNRZ 302.
AB  - Glutamic acid uptake in Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus was energy dependent, the source of energy and adaptation to sugar being important to efficiency of uptake. The disaccharides, lactose and sucrose, stimulated uptake, but cells grown in glucose were more active. Optimum temperature was approximately 40 degrees C and pH approximately 7.0. NaCl was strongly inhibitory to the uptake of glutamic acid although not to that of isoleucine. High specificity existed because only L-aspartic acid was inhibitory.
TI  - A method for determining beta-galactosidase activity of yogurt cultures in skim milk.
AB  - A method was developed for determining the specific activity of bacterial beta-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23) during growth of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus in skim milk. Individual and mixed strain cultures of S. thermophilus (St 3642, St14485) and L. bulgaricus (Lb11842, Lb880) were examined for growth (OD at 600 nm and viable cell counts), acid production, and beta-galactosidase activity (expressed as a function of recoverable TCA-precipitable cellular protein). Cultures were inoculated into 10% skim milk (2% inoculum) and incubated at 40 degrees C for 12 h. Aliquots were removed at 2-h intervals and diluted with ice cold EDTA, pH 12. The EDTA chelates calcium and solubilizes milk protein, allowing separation of the bacteria by centrifugation. Cells were then washed twice with 20 mM phosphate buffer and disrupted by sonication. Cell debris and intact cells were removed by centrifugation and the cell-free extract evaluated for beta-galactosidase activity using o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside as substrate. Specific activities ranged from 0 to 6 units/mg protein. This simple and reproducible method is applicable for enzyme assays and measurement of cellular components where contamination by milk proteins is a potential problem.
TI  - Purification and thermostability of beta-galactosidase (lactase) from an autolytic strain of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus.
AB  - beta-Galactosidase from an autolytic strain of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus was purified 109-fold to near homogeneity. The yield of purified enzyme was 41% and the specific activity was 592 o-nitrophenyl beta-D-galactopyranoside U/mg at 37 degrees C. Two isozymes were present, but only one subunit was detected, having a mol. wt of 116,000. Enzyme stability was 37-83 times greater in milk than in buffer in the range 60-65 degrees C. At 60 degrees C the half-life in milk was 146 min. Denaturation in buffer was first-order, but in milk the overall reaction order with respect to enzyme concentration was approximately 0.5. The activation energy for denaturation was 453 kJ/mol in milk and 372 kJ/mol in buffer. In milk the activation energy for lactose hydrolysis was 35.1 kJ/mol.
TI  - Sugar Utilization and Acid Production by Free and Entrapped Cells of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis in a Whey Permeate Medium.
AB  - Cells of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis entrapped in k-carrageenan-locust bean gum gel performed similarly to free cells in the conversion of lactose to lactic acid. Bead diameter influenced the fermentation rate. Cells entrapped in smaller beads (0.5 to 1.0 mm) showed higher release rates, higher lactose, glucose, and formic acid utilization, higher galactose accumulation, and higher lactic acid production than did cells entrapped in larger beads (1.0 to 2.0 mm). Values for smaller beads were comparable with those for free cells. Immobilization affected the fermentation rate of lactic acid bacteria, especially Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. Entrapped cells of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus demonstrated a lower lactic acid production than did free cells in batch fermentation. The kinetics of the production of formic and pyruvic acids by L. lactis subsp. lactis and S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus are presented.
TI  - Lactose transport system of Streptococcus thermophilus: a hybrid protein with homology to the melibiose carrier and enzyme III of phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase systems.
AB  - The gene responsible for the transport of lactose into Streptococcus thermophilus (lacS) was cloned in Escherichia coli as a 4.2-kilobase fragment from an EcoRI library of chromosomal DNA by using the vector pKK223-3. From deletion analysis, the gene for lactose transport mapped to two HindIII fragments with a total size of 2.8 kilobases. The gene was transcribed in E. coli from its own promoter. Functional expression of lactose transport activity was shown by assaying for the uptake and exchange of lactose both in intact cells and in membrane vesicles. The nucleotide sequence of lacS and 200 to 300 bases of 3' and 5' flanking regions were determined. The gene was 1,902 base pairs long, encoding a 69,454-dalton protein with an NH2-terminal hydrophobic region and a COOH-terminal hydrophilic region. The NH2-terminal end was homologous with the melibiose carrier of E. coli (23% similarity overall; greater than 50% similarity for regions with at least 16 amino acids), whereas the COOH-terminal end showed 34 to 41% similarity with the enzyme III (domain) of three different phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase systems. Among the conserved amino acids were two histidyl residues, of which one has been postulated to be phosphorylated by HPr. Since sugars are not phosphorylated during translocation by the lactose transport system, it is suggested that the enzyme III-like region serves a regulatory function in this protein. The lacS gene also appears similar to the partially sequenced lactose transport gene of Lactobacillus bulgaricus (lacL; greater than 60% similarity). Furthermore, the 3' flanking sequence of the S. thermophilus lactose transport gene showed approximately 50% similarity with the N-terminal portion of the beta-galactosidase gene of L. bulgaricus. In both organisms, the lactose transport gene and the beta-galactosidase appear to be separated by a 3-base-pair intercistronic region.
TI  - Evidence for the conjugal transfer of the broad host range plasmid pIP501 into strains of Lactobacillus helveticus.
AB  - The conjugative broad host range plasmid pIP501 was transferred from Streptococcus faecalis to a series of strains of lactic streptococci used commercially as dairy starter cultures. With these transconjugants as donors the plasmid was exconjugated to two strains of Lactobacillus helveticus and a commercially used strain of Strep. thermophilus. There was evidence that the plasmid could transfer between isogenic derivatives of one of the strains of Lact. helveticus. Transfer from Lact. helveticus to Strep. faecalis was also detected but at a low frequency. There was no evidence for the conjugal transfer of plasmid pIP501 into a strain of Lact. bulgaricus by exconjugation from either lactic streptococci or Lactobacillus sp.
TI  - Effects of Lactic Acid Bacteria and Organic Acids on Growth and Germination of Bacillus cereus.
AB  - Growth and germination of vegetative cells and endospores of Bacillus cereus were affected by Streptococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus bulgaricus in nonfat milk medium and by salts of organic acids in broth medium. Growth of the lactic acid bacteria was not affected by B. cereus. B. cereus increased rapidly to about 10 CFU/ml when cells were added at the beginning of growth of lactic acid bacteria; it was inactivated slowly when added after 24 h and rapidly when added after 72 h of lactic acid bacterial growth. Streptococci were more inhibitory to the growth of B. cereus than lactobacilli were at 24 h. Spore germination was not affected after 24 h, but it was inhibited after 48 and 72 h of lactic acid bacterial growth. Acetate was more inhibitory to the growth of vegetative cells, while formate was more inhibitory to spore germination. Acetate, formate, and lactate (all at 0.1 M) completely inactivated multiplication of B. cereus at pH 6.1, 6.0, and 5.6, respectively. Spores of B. cereus were more resistant to these organic acids compared with the resistance of vegetative cells. Formate, lactate, and acetate (all at 0.1 M) caused 50% inhibition of spore germination at pH 4.4, 4.3, and 4.2, respectively.
TI  - Antitumor activity of lactic acid bacteria on a solid fibrosarcoma, sarcoma-180 and Ehrlich ascites carcinoma.
AB  - Antitumor activity of Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Streptococcus cremoris and Streptococcus lactis was investigated in solid mouse fibrosarcoma. Intratumor administration of lyophilised bacterial cells at a dose of 20 mg/kg body wt resulted in the regression of tumors in a maximum number of animals. Intraperitoneal injection at the same dose resulted in a significant increase in the survival time but was ineffective in curing the animals. Intratumor injection of Streptococcus thermophilus at a dose of 20 mg/kg body wt also inhibited the growth of fibrosarcoma accompanied by an increase in the survival time while intraperitoneal administration of S. thermophilus prolonged only the survival time and did not result in cure. In mice bearing the ascitic form of sarcoma-180 or Ehrlich ascites carcinoma, intraperitoneal administration of S. thermophilus resulted in complete cure in a very significant proportion of tumor-bearing mice. S. thermophilus was more effective in sarcoma-180 than in Ehrlich ascites carcinoma. The cured tumors did not recur.
TI  - [Adjuvant activity of lactic bacteria: perspectives for its use in oral vaccines].
AB  - The effect of the oral and subcutaneous administration of Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus on humoral antibody production and delayed type hypersensitivity response against sheep red blood cells (SRBC) was studied. The species of the genus Lactobacillus proved to be more effective in both cases, effects being stronger when working with viable bacteria than with non-viable cells. The stimulation of primary cellular and humoral immune responses reached optimal activity with a dose of 6 x 10(9) cells. The plaque-forming cells (PFC) and the circulating antibody titers to the SRBC antigen obtained in the groups treated with lactobacilli were 2 to 3 times higher than those of the non-treated control group. In mice fed with the different lactic acid bacteria circulating antibody against these microorganisms failed to be detected, but when they were administered by subcutaneous route a strong response to antilactic acid bacteria was stimulated. S. thermophilus was not effective in increasing the immune response. These results suggest that the lactobacilli by oral route, exert a strong adjuvant activity which is responsible for the enhanced host immune responses obtained. In this respect, lactobacilli could be considered as the most promising oral adjuvant.
TI  - Plasmid transduction in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus is a common dairy starter for which very few genetic exchange systems have been described. Here we report plasmid transduction by phi 17 alpha and phi 56 alpha, two virulent phages of industrial yogurt starter strains. Several replicons could be transduced, independently of their size, with efficiencies which are high enough to allow gene transfer from a transformable intermediary strain of S. thermophilus to other hosts of the bacteriophages studied.
TI  - Genetic transformation of Streptococcus thermophilus by electroporation.
AB  - A rapid and convenient electroporation procedure was developed for the genetic transformation of intact cells of Streptococcus thermophilus with various species of plasmid DNA. Transformation frequency was influenced by the capacitance and voltage selected for electric pulsing, the pH and composition of the electroporation medium and the molecular mass of the transforming DNA. Electroporation is a simple and effective technique to introduce plasmid DNA into S. thermophilus and useful in the development of recombinant DNA technology for this important industrial microorganism.
TI  - Development of an efficient spheroplast transformation procedure for S. thermophilus: the use of transfection to define a regeneration medium.
AB  - The conditions for the efficient polyethylene glycol (PEG)-induced spheroplast transformation of three strains of Streptococcus thermophilus have been established. This required the careful optimization of various experimental parameters, the most important being the choice of the lytic enzyme (lysozyme versus mutanolysin), the extent of cell wall digestion and the conditions for the PEG shock which were found to be strain-specific. The transfection assay we had previously developed for S. thermophilus represented a key step and powerful tool in our transformation studies. It allowed individual and stepwise adjustment of the above mentioned factors, but was also compulsory for the establishment of an effective regeneration medium for the strains we examined. Among various potential osmotic protectors tested, raffinose in combination with CaCl2 and MgCl2 was most efficient and routinely supported regeneration with up to 10% efficiency, after PEG treatment. With the spheroplast transformation procedure described in this paper, shuttle vectors and recombinant plasmids could be introduced into three industrial yogurt starters, with maximal efficiencies of 7.5 x 10(4) transformants/micrograms of liposome encapsulated, covalently closed circular DNA. A striking, yet unexplained, reduction in transformation rates was observed when erythromycin rather than chloramphenicol was used as the selecting agent.
TI  - Molecular cloning of lactose genes in dairy lactic streptococci: the phospho-beta-galactosidase and beta-galactosidase genes and their expression products.
AB  - The mesophilic (S. lactis and S. cremoris) and thermophilic (S. thermophilus) dairy lactic streptococci, which are used in industrial dairy fermentations, contain two different lactose hydrolysing enzymes, a phospho-beta-galactosidase and a beta-galactosidase. The central role of these enzymes in the pathways used for lactose transport and degradation is discussed along with their properties and distributions in lactic streptococci. In addition, recent results on the cloning, expression and sequence organization of the genes for the mesophilic phospho-beta-galactosidase and thermophilic beta-galactosidase are reviewed. Original data are presented concerning heterologous gene expression in the study of lactose hydrolysis in lactic streptococci. These include 1) the purification of the S. lactis phospho-beta-galactosidase from an overproducing Escherichia coli, and 2) the expression of the E. coli beta-galactosidase (lacZ) gene in S. lactis employing a lactic streptococcal expression vector.
TI  - Adherence of specific yogurt micro-organisms to human peripheral blood lymphocytes.
AB  - Yogurt lactic-acid-bacteria (LAB) consisting of Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus were evaluated for their capacity to bind to human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). These micro-organisms adhere to human T lymphocytes, and bind to B lymphocytes, in high and low frequencies, respectively. In addition, a quantitative analysis of LAB binding to PBL was carried out using the same parameters previously applied to a Salmonella model. The effect of yogurt LAB on the natural anti-bacterial activity exerted by PBL was examined. Lymphocyte pretreatment with bacteria did not affect such functions. These findings are discussed in the light of the well known ability of yogurt LAB to modulate the immune response.
TI  - Enhancement of host resistance against Salmonella typhimurium infection by a diet supplemented with yogurt.
AB  - The effect of a diet supplemented with yogurt containing live lactobacilli (LAB)  - Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus - on the response of inbred mice to infection with Salmonella typhimurium was elaborated. The results of our experiments were consistent with the hypothesis that modifications of the microflora influence the adherence of S. typhimurium to intestinal mucosa, the natural antibacterial activity of the Peyer's patches lymphocytes, the accumulation of the macrophages in the liver, the proliferative responses of the splenocytes. The relationship between modifications of the immune response following ingestion of yogurt with live LAB and increased defense mechanisms was confirmed by the bacterial counts in livers and spleens and by the reduced mortality to S. typhimurium infection.
TI  - Conjugative mobilization as an alternative vector delivery system for lactic streptococci.
AB  - Due to the current variability in applying polyethylene glycol-mediated protoplast transformation to lactic streptococci, a study was undertaken to assess the feasibility of conjugative mobilization as an alternative method for vector delivery. By using the broad-host-range conjugative plasmid pVA797, the partially homologous cloning vector pVA838 was successfully introduced into various strains of Streptococcus lactis, Streptococcus cremoris, Streptococcus lactis subsp. diacetylactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Streptococcus faecalis. Frequencies ranged from 10(-2) to 10(-6) transconjugants per recipient. Both pVA797 and pVA838 were acquired intact, without alteration in functionality. Also, the shuttle vector pSA3, which shares partial homology with pVA797, was mobilized via conjugation. The use of S. lactis LM2301 as the intermediate donor allowed the use of physiologic and metabolic characteristics for recipient differentiation. The construction of a vector containing a "DNA cassette" conferring mobilization and the resolution, segregation, and stability of the cointegrates, pVA797, pVA838, and pSA3, are also reported.
TI  - Enhancement of immune response in mice fed with Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Swiss mice, fed for 8 consecutive d with 50 micrograms/d of viable cultures of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Streptococcus thermophilus, showed significant variation in their immune system. In order to study this phenomenon assays for macrophage and lymphocyte function were carried out. Both lactic acid bacteria enhanced significantly the enzymatic and phagocytic activity of peritoneal macrophages as checked against the controls and also accelerated the phagocytic function of the reticuloendothelial system as revealed by the carbon clearance test. On the 2nd d (100 micrograms), L. acidophilus reached a peak of K = .271, which remained high. Streptococcus thermophilus was effective only on the 2nd d and then decreased. The lymphocytic activity studied by immunoglobulin secreting cells was assayed by Jerne's method of plaque-forming cells (PFC). This activity also was increased by the two microorganisms. Streptococcus thermophilus proved more effective than L. acidophilus. Lactobacillus acidophilus and S. thermophilus activated macrophages and lymphocytes and produced the same increase in the immune response of mice whether administered orally or intraperitoneally.
TI  - Purification and characterization of X-prolyl-dipeptidyl-aminopeptidase from Lactobacillus lactis and from Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - X-Prolyl-dipeptidyl-aminopeptidase recently was found in several lactic acid bacteria. This article describes the purification of the enzymes from Lactobacillus lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus and compares their characteristics. Enzymes from both strains are serine-peptidases. They both have a molecular weight of about 165,000 daltons, an isoelectric point near 4.5, and are constituted of two subunits. The pH optimum of the enzyme isolated from L. lactis is 7.0, whereas the enzyme from S. thermophilus possesses a broad pH optimum between 6.5 and 8.2 with glycyl-L-prolyl-aminomethylcoumarin as substrate. Below pH 5, both enzymes are unstable; however, that from S. thermophilus is more rapidly denatured. The enzyme from S. thermophilus is more sensitive to heat than the corresponding enzyme from L. lactis. Enzymes from the both strains have different specificities towards various substrates and are differently effected by metals, chelators, and other inhibitors. The importance of this enzyme for the metabolism of lactic acid bacteria is discussed.
TI  - Some properties of Streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophages.
AB  - The morphology, host range, structural proteins and serological properties of Streptococcus thermophilus phages isolated from Finnish cheese plants were investigated. The results show that all the nine phages belong morphologically to Ackermann's group B1. The host-phage reactions and plating efficiency justify the division of these phages into four specificity groups. Most of the phages showed an absolute host specificity as to their plating efficiency but were not strictly specific in the adsorption to different hosts. The electrophoretic profiles of the structural proteins appeared nearly identical. Ten to eleven well separated proteins could be detected. The antiserum raised against one of the phages contained antibodies with different neutralization capacity depending on the phage. Using an immunoblotting technique, four structural proteins were detected that could bind phage antibodies.
TI  - Effect of oxygen on lactose metabolism in lactic streptococci.
AB  - Three strains of Streptococcus lactis, two of Streptococcus cremoris, and one of  Streptococcus thermophilus metabolized oxygen in the presence of added carbohydrate primarily via a closely coupled NADH oxidase/NADH peroxidase system. No buildup of the toxic intermediate H(2)O(2) was detected with the three S. lactis strains. All six strains contained significant superoxide dismutase activity and are clearly aerotolerant. Lactose- or glucose-driven oxygen consumption was biphasic, with a rapid initial rate followed by a slower secondary rate which correlated with factors affecting the in vivo activation of lactate dehydrogenase. The rate of oxygen consumption was rapid under conditions that led to a reduction in lactate dehydrogenase activity (low intracellular fructose 1,6-bisphosphate concentration). These conditions could be achieved with nongrowing cells by adding lactose at a constant but limiting rate. When the rate of lactose fermentation was limited to 5% of its maximum, nongrowing cells of S. lactis strains ML3 and ML8 carried out an essentially homoacetic fermentation under aerobic conditions. These same cells carried out the expected homolactic fermentation when presented with excess lactose under anaerobic conditions. Homoacetic fermentation leads to the generation of more energy, by substrate-level phosphorylation via acetate kinase, than the homolactic fermentation. However, it was not observed in growing cells and was restricted to slow fermentation rates with nongrowing cells.
TI  - Oxygen uptake activity and aerobic metabolism of Streptococcus thermophilus STH450.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus STH450 had a very high oxygen uptake. This strain was  then compared with aerobic metabolism to S. thermophilus ATCC 19258, a reference strain for aerobic metabolism. Molecular oxygen, which was absorbed by S. thermophilus STH450 during aerobic glycolytic metabolism, was involved in the oxidation of NADH by the catalytic activity of NADH oxidase. The portion of pyruvate that corresponded to the oxidized NADH was committed to form alpha-acetolactate, acetoin, and diacetyl. Both strains were deficient in peroxidase and pyruvate oxidase activities; therefore, NADH oxidase was probably the terminal oxidase in aerobic glycolytic metabolism. Oxygen uptake and NADH oxidase activities were significantly higher in S. thermophilus STH450 than in S. thermophilus ATCC 19258. alpha-Acetolactate, acetoin, and diacetyl also accumulated during aerobic glycolytic metabolism of S. thermophilus STH450. However, when both strains were grown in the presence of pyruvate, these metabolites were equivalent. Hence, less oxygen might be needed for pyruvate metabolism.
TI  - Survival of lactic acid bacteria in the human stomach and adhesion to intestinal  cells.
AB  - The survival of four strains of lactic acid bacteria in human gastric juice, in vivo and in vitro, and in buffered saline, pH 1 to 5, has been investigated. The strains studied include two Lactobacillus acidophilus strains, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, and Streptococcus thermophilus. In addition, the adhesion of these strains to freshly collected human and pig small intestinal cells and to pig large intestinal cells has been studied and the effect of milk on both survival and adhesion tested. As a result of these investigations, an in vitro test system for screening potential cultures for use as human dietary adjuncts can be developed. The ability to survive in gastric juice and to adhere varied significantly for the strains tested; L. acidophilus ADH survived and adhered better than the others while S. thermophilus survived and adhered poorly. For all strains, both survival and adhesion was enhanced by milk. As all strains adhered to some extent to both human and pig intestinal cells, the adhesion mechanism is probably a nonspecific attachment as opposed to other reported specific Lactobacillus adhesion to gastric tissue. From the survival and adhesion data it seems feasible to obtain elevated levels of viable Lactobacillus sp. in human intestine by careful selection of the bacterial strains ingested. Furthermore, the in vitro methods used here should be valuable to screen potential strains. The data presented here can then be correlated with human in vivo studies monitoring the beneficial effect of ingestion of these Lactobacillus.
TI  - Influence of mastitis on growth of starter organisms used for the manufacture of  fermented milks.
AB  - The effect of milk containing increased somatic cells on the starter organisms Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus and L. acidophilus was examined. Increased somatic cell count resulted in stimulation of Str. thermophilus owing to increased proteolysis, but inhibition of L. acidophilus as a consequence of increased phagocytic activity of the polymorphonuclear leucocytes
TI  - Improved media for differentiation of rods and cocci in yogurt.
AB  - Selected yogurt starters and commercial samples grew on Elliker's lactic agar supplemented with .1% Tween 80 and 50 micrograms/ml of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride to produce small, red Streptococcus thermophilus colonies and larger, white Lactobacillus bulgaricus colonies. The distinction was somewhat strain dependent but was satisfactory in most cases. Addition of 7% skim milk (11% solids) to lactic agar in place of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride allowed good rod-coccus differentiation, regardless of strain or yogurt brand. On this medium, called yogurt lactic agar, L. bulgaricus appeared as large white colonies surrounded by a cloudy zone and S. thermophilus as smaller white colonies devoid of a surrounding halo. Casein precipitation was responsible for the halo effect around the more acidogenic L. bulgaricus colonies. Yogurt lactic agar compared favorably with S. thermophilus and Lactobacillus agar media for the recovery of S. thermophilus and L. bulgaricus in single and mixed cultures.
TI  - Influence of temperature on associative growth of Streptococcus thermophilus and  Lactobacillus bulgaricus.
AB  - Compatibility of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus during associative growth as dependent on optimum growth temperature was determined. Optimum growth temperatures for 9 strains of S. thermophilus and 10 strains of L. bulgaricus ranged from 35 to 42 degrees C for S. thermophilus and 43 to 46 degrees C for L. bulgaricus. Streptococcus thermophilus and L. bulgaricus strains exhibiting similar to divergent optimum growth temperatures were combined (1:1 vol/vol) and incubated in milk at 37, 42, and 45 degrees C until pH 4.2 was reached. Initial and postincubation cell numbers were determined by plate count method. Streptococcus thermophilus strains reached greater cell numbers than L. bulgaricus at 37, 42, and 45 degrees C in 93.3% of the mixed culture trials. Average rod-coccus ratios obtained at 37, 42, and 45 degrees C were 1:2.2, 1:8, and 1:2.4, respectively. Optimum growth temperatures had no influence on growth of L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus in mixed culture. Rather, temperature appeared to influence compatibility by determining the concentration or type of stimulatory factor(s) produced by L. bulgaricus. All strains of S. thermophilus exhibited an uncoupling of growth from acid production. Optimum temperature for acid production ranged from 2 to 8 degrees C above optimum growth temperature. These findings warrant consideration in the manufacture of yogurt and other fermented milk products.
TI  - A comparison of beta-galactosidase specific activities in strains of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Six Streptococcus thermophilus strains were examined for growth, acid production, and beta-galactosidase activity per milligram protein (specific activity), so that strain comparisons could be made. A wide range in activity was observed. Activity depended on growth time in M17 broth and, for most strains, continued to increase after cells had reached stationary phase. Maximum activity was at 16 h and ranged from 0 to 58 units/mg protein. Strain ST exhibited no beta-galactosidase activity but had trace phospho-beta-galactosidase activity (.8 units/mg protein after 2 h of growth). Strains 3641 and TS2B exhibited slower growth rates and lower beta-galactosidase activities in milk as compared to M17 broth. Further, strain 3641 exhibited 10 times the activity of strain TS2B (2.86 vs. .24 units) after 4 h of growth in milk.
TI  - Antimutagenic properties of lactic acid-cultured milk on chemical and fecal mutagens.
AB  - The antimutagenic properties of milk cultured with Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus were examined using streptomycin-dependent strains of Salmonella in an in vitro assay system. The mutagens utilized for testing included 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl) acrylamide, 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide, and fecal mutagenic extracts from cats, monkeys, dogs, and other mammals. Both types of cultured milk exhibited antimutagenic activity on all mutagens used. Antimutagenic activities of the cultured milks with 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl) acrylamide and 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide increased with incubation time but were thermolabile beyond 55 degrees C for 10 min.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the beta-D-galactosidase gene from Streptococcus thermophilus in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The beta-D-galactosidase (beta-gal) gene from Streptococcus thermophilus was cloned to isolate and characterize it for potential use as a selection marker in a food-grade cloning vector. Chromosomal DNA from S. thermophilus 19258 was cleaved with the restriction enzyme PstI and ligated to pBR322 for transformation into Escherichia coli JM108. A beta-galactosidase-positive clone was detected by its blue color on a medium supplemented with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-D-galactoside. This transformant possessed a single plasmid, designated pRH116, which contained, in addition to the vector DNA, a 7.0-kilobase (kb) PstI insertion fragment coding for beta-gal activity. An extract from JM108(pRH116) contained a beta-gal protein with the same electrophoretic mobility as the beta-gal from S. thermophilus 19258. Compared with the beta-gal from E. coli HB101, the S. thermophilus beta-gal was of lower molecular weight. A restriction map of pRH116 was constructed from cleavage of both the plasmid and the purified insert. The construction of deletion derivatives of pRH116 with BglII, BstEII, and HindIII revealed the approximate location of the gene on the 7.0-kb fragment. The beta-gal gene was further localized to a 3.85-kb region.
TI  - Estimation of the true growth yield and maintenance coefficient for yoghurt cultures.
AB  - Point and 95% confidence interval estimates of the true growth yield and maintenance coefficient are reported for four pure cultures andtwo mixed cultures of Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus grown anaerobically on 3% nonfat dry milk using batch followed by fed batch culture. An improved method of data analysis, which includes separate analysis of the exponential growth region and a new method of selecting smoothing spline functions, is utilized. The parameter estimation results are compared with the theoretical maximum yields for one and two moles of ATP produced per mole of glucose and to the growth yield estimated from the exponential growth region analysis.
TI  - Utilization of spline functions for smoothing fermentation data and for estimation of specific rates.
AB  - A response surface method of smoothing fermentation data with spline functions is presented. The available electron balance is used to optimally select the values of the smoothing parameters associated with the spline functions. The method is applied to six sets of anaerobic fermentation data in which pure and mixed cultures are grown in batch followed by fed batch culture. Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus are cultured on 3% dry milk. Measured concentrations of biomass, lactose, galactose, lactic acid, and other acid products are smoothed using spline functions. Values of specific growth rate, specific lactose consumption rate, specific galactose formation rate, and specific acid product formation rate are estimated and the consistency of the results is examined using the available electron balance. The results show that the method works reasonably well, but that an upper bound should be used for the smoothing parameters to obtain accurate estimates of the derivative quantities.
TI  - Analysis of exponential growth data for yoghurt cultures.
AB  - Obtaining accurate estimates of maximum specific growth rate, growth yield, and product yield is important for many fermentation processes. A systematic procedure is presented to select the exponential growth region and estimate the maximum specific growth rate using the covariate adjustment method with all the available measured variables (i.e. biomass, substrate, and product). The procedure is applied to data collected during growth of pure and mixed cultures of Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus on 3% dry milk under anaerobic conditions. The estimation procedure gives good estimates with relatively narrow confidence intervals even though biomass concentration is measured by an indirect method. The estimated values of maximum specific growth rate range from 0.2805 h(-1) for S. thermophilus (ATCC-19258) to 0.4672 h(-1) for S. thermophilus (Microlife). Growth and product yields are estimated using regression analysis and the data for the exponential growth region. The growth yields are compared to their theoretical maximum values.
TI  - Anaerobic fermentation of Lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus on 3% nonfat dry milk with pure and mixed culture.
AB  - Two different strains of Lactobacillus bulgaricus (ATCC-11842 and Microlife) and  two strains of Streptococcus thermophilus (ATCC-19258 and Microlife) were grown anaerobically on 3% nonfat dry milk in pure and mixed culture using batch followed by fed batch culture. Samples were collected every 30 min. Concentrations of lactose, galactose, lactic acid, and other products present were measured using high pressure liquid chromatography. A spectrophotometric method from the literature was modified and used to determine microbial biomass concentrations. Relative cell numbers of the two organisms were measured microscopically in mixed culture. The results are presented in tabular form. S. thermophilus (Microlife) showed different growth characteristics compared to the other cultures. This culture utilized most of the galactose that was formed and produced greater amounts of lactic acid and biomass.
TI  - Fermentation of aqueous plant seed extracts by lactic Acid bacteria.
AB  - The effects of lactic acid bacterial fermentation on chemical and physical changes in aqueous extracts of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), peanut (Arachis hypogea), soybean (Glycine max), and sorghum (Sorghum vulgare) were studied. The bacteria investigated were Lactobacillus helveticus, L. delbrueckii, L. casei, L. bulgaricus, L. acidophilus, and Streptococcus thermophilus. Organisms were inoculated individually into all of the seed extracts; L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus were also evaluated together as inocula for fermenting the legume extracts. During fermentation, bacterial population and changes in titratable acidity, pH, viscosity, and color were measured over a 72-h period at 37 degrees C. Maximum bacterial populations, titratable acidity, pH, and viscosity varied depending upon the type of extract and bacterial strain. The maximum population of each organism was influenced by fermentable carbohydrates, which, in turn, influenced acid production and change in pH. Change in viscosity was correlated with the amount of protein and titratable acidity of products. Color was affected by pasteurization treatment and fermentation as well as the source of extract. In the extracts inoculated simultaneously with L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus, a synergistic effect resulted in increased bacterial populations, titratable acidity, and viscosity, and decreased pH in all the legume extracts when compared to the extracts fermented with either of these organisms individually. Fermented extracts offer potential as substitutes for cultured dairy products.
TI  - Galactokinase activity in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - ATP-dependent phosphorylation of [14C]galactose by 11 strains of Streptococcus thermophilus indicated that these organisms possessed the Leloir enzyme, galactokinase (galK). Activities were 10 times higher in fully induced, galactose-fermenting (Gal+) strains than in galactose-nonfermenting (Gal-) strains. Lactose-grown, Gal- cells released free galactose into the medium and were unable to utilize residual galactose or to induce galK above basal levels. Gal+ S. thermophilus 19258 also released galactose into the medium, but when lactose was depleted growth on galactose commenced, and galK increased from 0.025 to 0.22 micromol of galactose phosphorylated per min per mg of protein. When lactose was added to galactose-grown cells of S. thermophilus 19258, galK activity rapidly decreased. These results suggest that galK in Gal+ S. thermophilus is subject to an induction-repression mechanism, but that galK cannot be induced in Gal- strains.
TI  - Galactose transport in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Although Streptococcus thermophilus accumulated [14C]lactose in the absence of an endogenous energy source, galactose-fermenting (Gal+) cells were unable to accumulate [14C]galactose unless an additional energy source was added to the test system. Both Gal+ and galactose-nonfermenting (Gal-) strains transported galactose when preincubated with sucrose. Accumulation was inhibited 50 or 95% when 10 mM sodium fluoride or 1.0 mM iodoacetic acid, respectively, was added to sucrose-treated cells, indicating that ATP was required for galactose transport activity. Proton-conducting ionophores also inhibited galactose uptake, although N,N'-dicyclohexyl carbodiimide had no effect. The results suggest that galactose transport in S. thermophilus occurs via an ATP-dependent galactose permease and that a proton motive force is involved. The galactose permease in S. thermophilus TS2b (Gal+) had a Km for galactose of 0.25 mM and a Vmax of 195 micromol of galactose accumulated per min per g (dry weight) of cells. Several structurally similar sugars inhibited galactose uptake, indicating that the galactose permease had high affinities for these sugars.
TI  - Isolation and partial characterization of plasmid DNA from Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Of 23 strains of Streptococcus thermophilus examined, 5 were found to contain a single small cryptic plasmid, designated pHM1 through pHM5. Through analysis by restriction endonuclease mapping and DNA-DNA hybridization, the five plasmids were found to be closely related. They were present in 4 to 18 copies per cell and ranged in size from 1.4 to 2.2 megadaltons. Plasmids pHM1 and pHM5, as well as pHM2 and pHM4, were found to be identical. Single restriction endonuclease sites were observed on each plasmid for PvuII and MboI. Plasmids pHM2 and pHM3 each had an additional single site for HhaI, and pHM1 had an additional single site for HindIII. The characteristics of these plasmids may make them useful for the development of cloning vectors for use in S. thermophilus.
TI  - Use of microbial beta-lactamase to destroy penicillin added to milk.
AB  - A simple method is described for destruction of penicillin residues in bulk milk  to an undetectable amount (less than .003 U/ml) with commercially available crude beta-lactamase enzyme. Milk containing .1 or .5 U/ml penicillin G was treated with .01 to 1.0 mU/ml of beta-lactamase (Bacillus cereus) for up to 96 h. The Bacillus stearothermophilus var. calidolactis assay was used to quantify penicillin in milk between .003 to 1.0 U/ml. The .5 U/ml of penicillin G was reduced to an undetectable amount within 18 h at 4 degrees C by 1.0 mU/ml of beta-lactamase. The development of titratable acidity over 5 to 6 h in contaminated milks treated with beta-lactamase and inoculated with Streptococcus thermophilus GH, Streptococcus cremoris, Streptococcus lactis, or a commercial starter culture was the same as for control milk samples containing no additives or only enzyme. Pilot-scale manufacture of Swiss and Cheddar cheeses from contaminated milks treated with beta-lactamase yielded cheeses of comparable quality, to control cheeses produced from penicillin-free milk. There were no delays in acid production as judged from pH measurements during production and ripening of the cheeses. About 50% of beta-lactamase activity added to milk remained after pasteurization at 63 degrees C for 30 min. The safety for human consumption of cheese containing small quantities of penicillin degradation products from milk treated with beta-lactamase remains to be established.
TI  - Secretory and serum antibodies against Streptococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Lactobacillus bulgaricus in relation to ingestion of fermented milk products.
AB  - Serum, saliva, and urine were analyzed for the presence of IgA, IgG, and IgM antibodies reactive with the yoghurt bacteria Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus. A comparison was made between four subjects who frequently ate yoghurt and four subjects who never ate yoghurt. Salivary IgA and serum IgG activity against the milk-fermenting bacterium S. lactis was studied in five other subjects before, during, and after a period of ingestion of a fermented milk product, filmjolk. All analyses were carried out by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. Antibody activity against the yoghurt bacteria was found in saliva, serum, and urine. No difference in antibody activity between yoghurt eaters and non-yoghurt eaters was measured for salivary IgA, but for serum IgG a lower activity against S. thermophilus was present among the yoghurt eaters. Antibody activity against S. lactis was present already before the ingestion of filmjolk began, and the activity was not altered during the period of ingestion. It is concluded that in adult subjects, the ingestion of milk-fermenting bacteria does not result in a significant change in the antibody activity against these bacteria.
TI  - Nutritional value of yogurt.
AB  - Yogurt, made from fortified skim milk by conventional methods using Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus, was used in studies of the effect of fermentation on nutritional value of milk. In all experiments, the product was compared with the uninoculated base milk. The concentration of most vitamins was less in yogurt than in milk and was most noticeably so for biotin which was 60% less. The effect on folic acid content was inconsistent. In nutritional experiments with rats, high values for true digestibility, biological value and net protein utilization were obtained for both yogurt and its base milk, only minor differences being apparent between the two materials. In growth tests with rats, yogurt was not found to be consistently superior to the base milk when the milk was subjected to a double heat treatment to reduce bacterial contamination. Yogurt did not confer a nutritional advantage on fresh milk in this respect.
TI  - Selection of Galactose-Fermenting Streptococcus thermophilus in Lactose-Limited Chemostat Cultures.
AB  - Stock cultures of Streptococcus thermophilus are essentially galactose negative (Gal). Although both galactose 1-phosphate uridyl transferase and uridine-5-diphospho-glucose 4-epimerase are present, suggesting that the genes for the Leloir pathway exist, cells cannot induce high levels of galactokinase. Therefore, galactose is largely excreted when cultures are grown on lactose, and most strains cannot be readily adapted to grow on free galactose. Gal cultures were grown in a chemostat under lactose limitation in which high concentrations of residual galactose were present. Under this selection pressure, Gal organisms eventually took over the culture with all four strains examined. Gal cells had induced galactokinase, and three of the four strains grew on free galactose with doubling times of 40 to 50 min. When Gal organisms were grown on lactose in batch culture, the galactose moiety was only partially utilized while lactose was still present. As lactose was exhausted, and catabolite repression was lifted, the Leloir pathway enzymes (especially galactokinase) were induced and the residual galactose fermented. Neither phospho-beta-galactosidase activity nor the enzymes of the d-tagatose 6-phosphate pathway were detected in S. thermophilus. In contrast to Streptococcus cremoris and Streptococcus lactis, fermentation was homolactic with galactose in batch cultures and with lactose limitation in the chemostat. When mixed Gal-Gal cultures were repeatedly transferred in milk, the Gal cells became the dominant cell type. The Gal phenotype of stock cultures probably reflects their prolonged maintenance in milk.
TI  - The effect of yoghurt on some components of the gut microflora and on the metabolism of lactose in the rat.
AB  - Feeding yoghurt or base milk (from which the yoghurt was prepared by fermentation) to rats increased the counts of coliforms in the gut whereas the counts of lactobacilli were reduced by yoghurt but not by the base milk. Lactobacillus bulgaricus survived in the guts of gnotobiotic and conventional rats when yoghurt was fed continuously. Streptococcus thermophilus also survived in gnotobiotic rats but its ability to survive in conventional rats could not be examined. Both organisms failed to colonise the gut when a small inoculum of yoghurt was administered orally to germfree rats maintained on the stock diet. Streptococcus thermophilus but not Lact. bulgaricus grew in the rat diet when tested in vitro. Two enzyme systems (beta-galactosidase and lactase) were studied using, respectively, o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG) and lactose as the test substrates. Enzyme levels estimated with both substrates increased in the gut contents when rats were fed yoghurt but an increase was only found with ONPG in the intestinal mucosa fraction. The bacterial origin of all this increased activity is discussed. The other lactose-containing diets did not affect enzyme activity to the same degree. Feeding yoghurt changed the lactobacillus flora from one which was predominantly heterofermentative (Lact. reuteri ) to one which was predominantly homofermentative (Lact. salivarius).
TI  - DNA base composition, DNA-DNA homology and long-chain fatty acid studies on streptococcus thermophilus and Streptococcus salivarius.
AB  - DNA base composition, DNA-DNA homology and long-chain fatty acid studies were performed on Streptococcus thermophilus and Streptococcus salivarius. These species possess similar mol % G + C values (about 37 to 41), long-chain fatty acid profiles and belong to a single DNA homology group. On the basis of the present and earlier studies it is proposed that Streptococcus thermophilus (Orla-Jensen) be reclassified as Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus comb. nov.
TI  - Stimulation of Streptococcus thermophilus growth in mastitic milk.
AB  - Growth of Streptococcus thermophilus was faster in mastitic milk, aseptically collected following intramammary infusion of Escherichia coli endotoxin, than in normal aseptically collected milk. The contribution of polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMN), of plasma and plasmin to this stimulation has been investigated. Addition of plasmin to low cell count milk stimulated growth of the streptococcus to the same degree as mastitic milk. However, addition of plasma or PMN from blood or from milk were less stimulatory. The part played by these components in providing casein breakdown products for the weakly proteolytic Str. thermophilus in mastitic milk is discussed.
TI  - Contribution of Streptococcus thermophilus to growth-stimulating effect of yogurt on rats.
AB  - The origin of the growth-stimulating factor in yogurt was studied in rats fed liquid or freeze-dried diets of milk, yogurt, milks fermented individually by Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus, milks to which cells of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus were added. Diets containing sonicated cells, cell supernatant, and cell fractions also were fed. Milk fermented by Streptococcus thermophilus and milk plus Streptococcus thermophilus cells stimulated growth as effectively as did yogurt. That finding and the absence of stimulation in rats fed Lactobacillus bulgaricus showed that Streptococcus thermophilus is responsible for stimulation of growth by yogurt. Growth was stimulated by an intracellular factor and not by fermentative changes in the milk.
TI  - Numerical taxonomy of Streptococcus.
AB  - A numerical taxonomic study of strains of Streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. The major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (S. faecalis, S. faecium, 'S. avium' and a proposed new species 'S. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (S. bovis, S. equinus, S. salivarius, 'S. casseliflavus', S. mutans, S. raffinolactis and an unidentified Oral Group I); (c) lactic species group (S. lactis including S. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (S. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (S. mitis, S. sanguis, a proposed new species 'S. oralis' and 'S. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, S. equi, 'S. equisimilis' including 'S. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of Lancefield Group B strains of human origin); (g) parapyogenic species group (S. uberis, 'S. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of Lancefield Groups R, S and T). Species of Aerococcus, Gemella, Leuconostoc and Pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.
TI  - Uptake of Branched-Chain Amino Acids by Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The transport of branched-chain amino acids in Streptococcus thermophilus was energy dependent. The metabolic inhibitors of glycolysis and ATPase enzymes were active, but the proton-conducting uncouplers were not. Transport was optimal at temperatures of between 30 and 45 degrees C and at pH 7.0 for the three amino acids leucine, valine, and isoleucine; a second peak existed at pH 5.0 with valine and isoleucine. By competition and kinetics studies, the branched-chain amino acids were found to share at least a common transport system.
TI  - Effect of feeding fermented milk on the incidence of chemically induced colon tumors in rats.
AB  - The effect of feeding skim milk fermented by Streptococcus thermophilus or Lactobacillus bulgaricus on the incidence of chemically induced colon tumors was studied in rats. Weanling Fisher-344 rats were fed chow plus skim milk (SM), chow plus SM fermented by S. thermophilus, chow plus SM fermented by L. bulgaricus, or chow plus water until sacrifice at 36 weeks, or before if moribund. Colon tumors were induced by s.c. injections of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine hydrochloride during weeks 3 through 22. The control (chow + water) group received saline injections. The survival rate of the rats fed fermented milks was significantly higher than that of the rats fed nonfermented milk. The latter had a significantly higher incidence of ear-duct tumors than the rats receiving fermented milk. The percentage of rats showing colon tumors was similar among all three experimental groups. The control group did not have any tumors. The rats receiving fermented milk had a significantly higher incidence of small-intestine tumors than those receiving nonfermented milk. The rats on S. thermophilus milk had the lowest percentage of malignant colon tumors of the three experimental groups. Results indicated that the feeding of fermented milks altered the metabolism of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine and shifted the target organ from the ear duct to the small intestine. In addition, the colon tumor distribution for the fermented-milk groups appeared to shift toward the anus.
TI  - Phosphofructokinases from Lactobacteriaceae. II. Purification and properties of phosphofructokinase from Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Phosphofructokinase (ATP : D-fructose-6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.11) from Streptococcus thermophilus has been purified. It is a tetramer composed of identical subunits of molecular weight 36 000 and exhibits Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Compared to the phosphofructokinases from taxonomically related bacteria, the enzyme from S. thermophilus is more stable at high temperatures. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the phosphofructokinases from lactobacteria and also from Bacillus stearothermophilus show immunologic cross-reaction. In spite of the significantly different kinetic properties and the different thermostability of these enzymes, this finding indicates great structural resemblance.
TI  - Effect of the addition of extracts of thermophilic lactobacilli on acid production by Streptococcus thermophilus in milk.
AB  - Soluble extracts of 20 strains of thermophilic lactobacilli (Lactobacillus helveticus, L. lactis and L. bulgaricus) were prepared and added to milk for the culture of 10 strains of Streptococcus thermophilus. Acid production was stimulated in 64.5% of cases for 9 of these 10 strains. The L. helveticus extracts were the most stimulatory, but the same extracts did not always strongly stimulate each strain of Str. thermophilus. The stimulatory effects observed varied with the volume of extract and the strain of Str. thermophilus. The exception was Str. thermophilus 385, which was never stimulated. The stimulatory effects observed were due to aminopeptidases present in the lactobacillus extracts and were not related to a general caseinolytic activity. The possible addition of such extracts to milk for cooked hard cheese is discussed.
TI  - Deoxyribonucleic Acid homology among lactic streptococci.
AB  - A comparison was made by deoxyribonucleic acid homology of 45 strains of lactic streptococci, using two strains of Streptococcus cremoris and three strains of Streptococcus lactis as reference strains. All S. cremoris strains were grouped together by deoxyribonucleic acid homology. S. lactis strains formed a second group, except that three strains of S. lactis showed a high degree of homology with S. cremoris strains. The three Streptococcus diacetylactis strains could not be differentiated from S. lactis strains. In spite of these differences between S. lactis and S. cremoris strains, the majority of S. cremoris, S. lactis, and S. diacetylactis strains studied had at least 50% of their base sequences in common. In contrast, Streptococcus thermophilus strains generally showed little relationship with the other strains of lactic streptococci. The relevance of these findings to the selection of starter strains for cheese making is discussed.
TI  - Antibiotic Resistances of Yogurt Starter Cultures Streptococcus thermophilus and  Lactobacillus bulgaricus.
AB  - Twenty-nine strains of Lactobacillus bulgaricus and 15 strains of Streptococcus thermophilus were tested for resistance to 35 antimicrobial agents by using commercially available sensitivity disks. Approximately 35% of the isolates had uncharacteristic resistance patterns.
TI  - Culture of five commonly used Acid-producing bacteria on banana pulp.
AB  - A significant fraction of the bananas and plantains produced in the humid tropics are wasted due to rapid spoilage. The use of acid-producing, anaerobic fermentation may be a safe and economical way to preserve the fruit in both large- and small-scale applications. The abilities of five commonly used, acid-producing bacteria to ferment media containing ripe or green bananas were examined. Three homofermentative bacteria, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Streptococcus faecalis, typically reduced the pH of a puree of ripe bananas from 4.8 to about 3.5 to 3.6 in 7 days at 37 degrees C. Action on green bananas was similar, but the drop in pH was less pronounced. Very little gas evolved. Lactobacillus fermentum (formerly Lactobacillus fermenti) and Leuconostoc mesenteroides showed active gas evolution and a significant drop in pH. About twice as much gas evolved from ripe banana medium as from green bananas. The fermented purees were spongy, soft solids floating in a clear liquor. The color was medium to light creamy brown, and the odor was pleasant. Fermented products stored at room temperature retained good appearance and aroma throughout a 1-month storage test.
TI  - [In vivo study of the growth characteristics of the microflora of Armenian yogurt].
AB  - The microflora from the Armenian yoghurt was studied during its growth on the optimal for the medium (skim milk) using objectives of the Peshkoff system. It was shown that certain organisms of Lactobacterium jogorti tended to branch at the early stages of their growth, and the cells elongated and formed complex coils and helices by the third-fourth day of growth. Compact aggregates of cocci having angular outlines appeared in the culture of Streptococcus thermophilus by the end of the second day of growth. Lysis of individual organisms, and occasionally zones of lysis, were found in the both cultures at certain stages of their growth. Cultures grown for 4-5 days were characterized by wide polymorphism.
TI  - Effect of prostaglandin E1-induced elevation of cyclic AMP on glucose repression  in the lactic streptococci.
AB  - Cyclic adenosine 3', 5' -monophosphate (cAMP) activity was observed in Streptococcus lactis C2, Streptococcus cremoris C10, Streptococcus diacetlactis 18-16, and Streptococcus thermophilus C3. In vitro assays of cell-free extracts obtaianed from S. lactis C2 showed that the cAMP-associated enzymes adenyl cyclase and phosphodiesterase were also present. In vitro experiments showed that prostaglandin E1 (PGE) stimulation of adenyl cyclase increased cAMP concentrations approximately fivefold, and in vivo studies showed that PGE treatment of S. lactis C2 increased intracellular cAMP concentrations twofold. Futhermore, PGE-induced elevation of intracellular cAMP levels was shown to prevent the repression of ss-D-phosphogalactoside galactohydrolase synthesis by glucose.
TI  - Differences in sensitivity to penicillin between strains of Streptococcus thermophilus [proceedings].
AB  
TI  - Aflatoxin B1 effect on beta-D-galactosidase in some starter cultures.
AB  - Six starter cultures were examined for their ability to induce beta-D-Galactosidase activity. The maximum (713 x 10(-4) units/ml) and minimum (140 x 10(-4) units/ml) enzyme activity was shown by Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptomyces thermophilus, respectively. The maximum inhibition by aflatoxin B1 of induction and activity of enzyme in vitro was observed at 60 micrograms/ml in all cultures. However, low levels of the toxin stimulated induction of the enzyme in Streptococcus lactis and S. thermophilus.

TI  - [Detection of inhibitory substances in milk using the modified reduction micromethod].
AB  - In order to rationalize work and to reduce the consumption of laboratory glassware a reduction micromethod with the bacterial stain Streptococcus thermophilus has been modified; the method is used to detect inhibitory substances in genuine, pausteurized and dried milk, and it is performed on a serological plate made from organic glass. The method is sensitive to most antibiotics used in the veterinary clinical practice. The detection sensitivity to penicillin residua ranges from 0.0015 to 0.0015 i.u. in 1 ml of milk. The method may be assessed as semi-quantitative.
TI  - Interaction of bacteriophage infection and low penicillin concentrations on the performance of yogurt cultures.
AB  - Bacteriophage infection of a mixed-strain Streptococcus thermophilus culture, one strain of which is phage sensitive and the other phage resistant, may induce lysis of both strains. Experiments were carried out with three different phage-resistant strains. One such strain lysed in penicillin-free growth medium and another needed penicillin G (0.005 IU/ml) for lysis, while the third strain continued to grow in the presence of this concentration of antibiotic. Growth of the latter strain was inhibited when the medium contained a relatively high concentration of phage lysin. The different penicillin concentrations required to induce "lysis from without" of these phage-resistant strains correlated with their individual sensitivities to the antibiotic. The apparent relationship between the sensitivities of these strains to penicillin and to phage lysin could be explained by a difference in the degree of polymerization of the cell wall peptidoglycan.
TI  - Production of beta-galactosidase from Streptococcus thermophilus grown in whey.
AB  - beta-D-Galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23) was extracted from Streptococcus thermophilus  grown in deproteinized cheese whey. Cultural conditions optimum for maximum enzyme production were pH 7.0, 40 degrees C, and 24 h. Proteose peptone (2.0%, wt/vol) and corn steep liquor (2.8%, wt/vol) were highly stimulatory, increasing the enzyme units available in their absence from 660 U/liter of medium to 18,200 and 10,000 U/liter of medium, respectively, in their presence. There was an insignificant increase in the production of enzyme in the presence of added inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus sources. Enzymatic hydrolysis for recuction of lactose content in aqueous solution and in skim milk was studied.
TI  - Utilization of Lactose, Glucose, and Galactose by a Mixed Culture of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus in Milk Treated with Lactase Enzyme.
AB  - The mechanism responsible for an increased rate of acid production when yogurt starter cultures are grown in milk treated with lactase enzyme was investigated by studying carbohydrate utilization and acid development by a pure culture of Streptococcus thermophilus and a mixed yogurt starter culture consisting of S. thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus. In milk containing glucose, galactose, and lactose, glucose and lactose (but not free galactose) were fermented. Fermentation of lactose in control milk was accompanied by the release of free galactose, with the result that carbohydrate utilization was less efficient than in treated milk. This phenomenon also occurred when lactose was fermented by S. thermophilus in broth culture. Carbohydrate utilization by the mixed yogurt culture was more rapid when the lactose in milk was partially prehydrolyzed. Our results suggest that the more rapid acid development that took place when a mixed yogurt starter culture was grown in milk containing prehydrolyzed lactose was the result of a more rapid and efficient utilization of carbohydrate by S. thermophilus when free glucose in addition to lactose was available for fermentation. The evidence presented also suggests that uptake and utilization of glucose and lactose by S. thermophilus are different in broth and milk cultures.
TI  - Arthritogenicity in rats of cell walls from several streptococci staphylococci and two other bacteria.
AB  - Bacterial cell walls from Str. bovis, Str. lactis, Str. mutans, Str. thermophilus, Str. salivarius, and Str. pyogenes were able to produce polyarthritis in rats but Str. faecalis cell walls were nonarthritogenic. S. aureus cell walls produced extremely severe disease. It was also shown that cell walls from S. epidermidis, B. megaterium, and M. lysodeikticus were nonarthritogenic. A close correlation was observed between development of arthritis and the delayed hypersensitivity to bacterial peptidoglycans but not with the PPD hypersensitivity. It was suggested that the adjuvanticity of bacterial cell walls is needed to induce the disease and that arthritogenicity requires a specific antigen in addition to the presence of an adjuvant-inducing agent.
TI  - Microorganisms and characteristics of laban.
AB  - Laban had a titratable acidity of about 1.0%, a pH of 4.25, an ethanol content of 1.25%, and contained 4.2 mug acetaldehyde and 34 mug acetoin/ml. There was no diacetyl. Five microorganisms, classified as Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Leuconostoc lactis, Kluyveromyces fragilis, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, were responsible for the fermentation. Streptococcus thermophilus and L. acidophilus were responsible for acid production with S. thermophilus producing acid more rapidly. Most of the acetaldehyde was produced by K. fragilis, little ethanol was found in absence of S. cerevisiae, and the acetoin was producted by S. thermophilus.
TI  - [Development and resistance of staphylococci in Bulgaricus milk].
AB  - Studied was the dynamics of development of 9 strains of staphilococci isolated from humans and animals, kept in heat-treated milk, and their resistance in Bulgarian sour milk. It was established that the pathogenic Staph. aureus and Staph. epidermidis develop will in fresh milk kept up to 7 days at 2--6degreesC and 18--22degreesC. In the production of Bulgarian sour milk Staph, aureus was shown to be viable, remaining active for seven days at 2 to 6degreesC. At room temperature (18--22degreesC) the survival rate has been dependent on the dynamics of accumulating metabolite products in connection with the development of Lactobac. bulgaricum and Streptococcus thermophilus. When the total acidity value reaches 160degreesT the pathogenic staphylococci are destroyed. Staphylococcus epidermidis finds no favourable medium to develop in Bulgarian sour milk, and it perishes when the total acidity is 120degreesT and pH -- 3.
TI  - Binding of the Fluorescent probes 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate and N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine to bacteria.
AB  - Changes in fluorescence intensities in Pseudomonas fluorescens, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Bacillus subtilis were investigated by means of the fluorescence probes (1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate and N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine) during a temperature programmed run. A decrease in fluorescence intensity was observed in all investigated organisms when the temperature was elevated from 4 to about 40 degrees C. A strong increase in fluorescence intensity was found in gram-negative Ps. fluorescens and E. coli when the temperature was elevated over 40 degrees C. On the other hand, only a slight enhancement in fluorescence intensities was observed in gram-positive Str. thermophilus and B. subtilis when the lipid specific dye NPN was applied at elevated temperatures. Discontinuities in all the fluorescence temperature profiles were found between 20 and 30 degrees C in the case of both ANS and NPN. With ANS the fluorescence profiles turned upwards and with NPN downwards after the inflection points. The effects of KCl, NH4Cl, NaCl and LiCl on ANS binding differed from those detected for NPN. Saturation of probe binding was reached at lower salt concentrations in the case of NPN than ANS, but depended somewhat on temperature.
TI  - [Influence of some factors on the quality of Bulgarian sour milk].
AB  - The results obtained with three feeding experiments revealed that combined forages containing biovit-40 are effective in that the antibiotic is not excreted with cow's milk and it does not inhibit the development of lactic acid fermentation. The season of the year associated with the passage of a given type of feed on to another type was found to influence the course of the lactic acid fermentation as follows: --in feeding green mass in the summer period there is a stimulation of the development of Lactobacillus bulgaricum and Str. thermophilus in the milk; -- in feeding greater amounts of succulent forages in the winter, spring, and autumn periods there is a retardation in the development of the same organisms in the milk.
TI  - Recovery of Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus on Nine Commonly Used Agar Media.

TI  - Susceptibility of cheese and yoghurt starter bacteria to antibiotics.
AB  - Eight single-strain lactic streptococci, three commercial cheese starters, and six lactic acid bacteria isolated from yoghurt were examined for their susceptibility to penicillin, cloxacillin, tetracycline-hydrochloride and streptomycin. The ranges of the antibiotics causing 50% inhibition of the bacteria were (mug/ml): penicillin, 0.009 to 0.20; cloxacillin, 0.24 to 2.50; tetracycline, 0.09 to 0.60; and streptomycin, 0.35 to 13.0. The average concentrations required to cause 50 and 100% inhibition of the cheese starters were (mug/ml): penicillin, 0.12 and 0.26; cloxacillin, 1.91 and 3.9; tetracycline-hydrochloride, 0.13 and 0.36; and streptomycin, 0.59 and 2.06. All the cocci were about equally susceptible to tetracycline, and all organisms were more resistant to cloxacillin than penicillin. The yoghurt isolates were more resistant to streptomycin and more susceptible to penicillin than the cheese starters. The 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride test, using Streptococcus thermophilus BC as assay organism, does not detect low levels of streptomycin in milk. However, it is useful in detecting cloxacillin residues.
