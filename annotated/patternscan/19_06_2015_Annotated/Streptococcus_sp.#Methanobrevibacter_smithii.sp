TI  == in vitro bacterial growth and in vivo ruminal microbiota populations associated with bloat in steers grazing wheat forage.
AB  == the role of ruminal bacteria in the frothy bloat complex common to cattle grazing winter wheat has not been previously determined. two experiments, one in vitro and another in vivo, were designed to elucidate the effects of fresh wheat forage on bacterial growth, biofilm complexes, rumen fermentation end products, rumen bacterial diversity, and bloat potential. in exp. 1, 6 strains of ruminal bacteria (streptococcus bovis strain 26, prevotella ruminicola strain 23, eubacterium ruminantium b1c23, ruminococcus albus sy3, fibrobacter succinogenes ssp. s85, and ruminococcus flavefaciens c94) were used in vitro to determine the  effect of soluble plant protein from winter wheat forage on specific bacterial growth rate, biofilm complexes, vfa, and ruminal h2 and ch4 in mono or coculture  with methanobrevibacter smithii. the specific growth rate in plant protein medium containing soluble plant protein (3.27% nitrogen) was measured during a 24-h incubation at 39 degrees c in hungate tubes under a co2 gas phase. a monoculture  of m. smithii was grown similarly, except under h2:co2 (1:1), in a basal methanogen growth medium supplemented likewise with soluble plant protein. in exp. 2, 6 ruminally cannulated steers grazing wheat forage were used to evaluate  the influence of bloat on the production of biofilm complexes, ruminal microbial  biodiversity patterns, and ruminal fluid protein fractions. in exp. 1, cultures of r. albus (p < 0.01) and r. flavefaciens (p < 0.05) produced the most h2 among  strains and resulted in greater (p < 0.01) ch4 production when cocultured with m. smithii than other coculture combinations. cultures of s. bovis and e. ruminantium + m. smithii produced the most biofilm mass among strains. in exp. 2, when diets changed from bermudagrass hay to wheat forage, biofilm production increased (p < 0.01). biofilm production, concentrations of whole ruminal content (p < 0.01), and cheesecloth filtrate protein fractions (p < 0.05) in the ruminal  fluid were greater on d 50 for bloated than for nonbloated steers when grazing wheat forage. the molecular analysis of the 16s rdna showed that 2 different ruminal microbiota populations developed between bloated and nonbloated animals grazing wheat forage. bloat in cattle grazing wheat pastures may be caused by increased production of biofilm, resulting from a diet-influenced switch in the rumen bacterial population.

TI  == h2/co2 metabolism in acetogenic bacteria isolated from the human colon.
AB  == the present work reports on autotrophic metabolism in four h2/co2-utilizing acetogenic bacteria isolated from the human colon (two clostridium species, one streptococcus species, and ruminococcus hydrogenotrophicus). h2/co2-utilization by these human acetogenic strains occurred during both exponential and stationary phases of growth. acetate was the major metabolite produced by all isolates following the stoichiometric equation of reductive acetogenesis. furthermore, the ability of these acetogenic bacteria to incorporate 13co2 into acetate in the presence of h2 in the gas phase demonstrated the utilization of the reductive pathway of acetate formation from a one-carbon compound. energy conservation during the autotrophic metabolism in colonic acetogens might involve sodium- or proton-chemiosmotic mechanisms. a sodium-dependent atp generation was only demonstrated in one clostridium species, whereas sodium could be replaced by potassium in other strains. the minimal thresholds of hydrogen uptake were determined and varied from 1100 to 3680 ppm depending on the acetogenic strain. these values appeared higher than those measured for the colonic methanogen,methanobrevibacter smithii.
