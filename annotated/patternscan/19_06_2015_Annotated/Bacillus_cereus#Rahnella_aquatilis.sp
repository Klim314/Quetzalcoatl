TI  == [characterization of growth-promoting rhizobacteria in eucalyptus nitens seedlings].
AB  == rhizospheric and endophytic bacteria were isolated from the rizosphere and root tissue of eucalyptus nitens. the objective of this work was to evaluate their capacity to promote growth in seedlings of the same species under greenhouse conditions. the isolates that improved seedling growth were identified and characterized by their capacity to produce indoleacetic acid (iaa), solubilize phosphates and increase 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (acc) deaminase activity. one hundred and five morphologically different strains were isolated, 15 of which promoted e. nitens seedling growth, significantly increasing the height (50%), root length (45%) as well as the aerial and root dry weight (142% and 135% respectively) of the plants. bacteria belonged to the genus arthrobacter, lysinibacillus, rahnella and bacillus. isolates a. phenanthrenivorans 21 and b. cereus 113 improved 3.15 times the emergence of e. nitens after 12 days, compared to control samples. among isolated r. aquatilis, 78 showed the highest production of iaa (97.5+/-2.87 mug/ml) in the presence of tryptophan and the highest solubilizer index (2.4) for phosphorus, while b. amyloliquefaciens 60 isolate was positive for acc deaminase activity. our results reveal the potential of the studied rhizobacteria as promoters of emergence and seedling growth of e. nitens, and their possible use as pgpr inoculants, since they have more than one mechanism associated with plant growth promotion.
