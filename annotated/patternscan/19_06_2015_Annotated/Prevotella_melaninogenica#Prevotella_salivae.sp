TI  == chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma-associated proteobacteria, but not commensal prevotella spp., promote toll-like receptor 2-independent lung inflammation and pathology.
AB  == recent studies of healthy human airways have revealed colonization by a distinct  commensal bacterial microbiota containing gram-negative prevotella spp. however,  the immunological properties of these bacteria in the respiratory system remain unknown. here we compare the innate respiratory immune response to three gram-negative commensal prevotella strains (prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella nanceiensis and prevotella salivae) and three gram-negative pathogenic proteobacteria known to colonize lungs of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) and asthma (haemophilus influenzae b, non-typeable haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis). the commensal prevotella spp.  and pathogenic proteobacteria were found to exhibit intrinsic differences in innate inflammatory capacities on murine lung cells in vitro. in vivo in mice, non-typeable h. influenzae induced severe toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2)-independent copd-like inflammation characterized by predominant airway neutrophilia, expression of a neutrophilic cytokine/chemokine profile in lung tissue, and lung  immunopathology. in comparison, p. nanceiensis induced a diminished neutrophilic  airway inflammation and no detectable lung pathology. interestingly, the inflammatory airway response to the gram-negative bacteria p. nanceiensis was completely tlr2-dependent. these findings demonstrate weak inflammatory properties of gram-negative airway commensal prevotella spp. that may make colonization by these bacteria tolerable by the respiratory immune system.

TI  == microbial transformation from normal oral microbiota to acute endodontic infections.
AB  == background: endodontic infections are a leading cause of oro-facial pain and tooth loss in western countries, and may lead to severe life-threatening infections. these infections are polymicrobial with high bacterial diversity. understanding the spatial transition of microbiota from normal oral cavities through the infected root canal to the acute periapical abscess can improve our knowledge of the pathogenesis of endodontic infections and lead to more effective treatment. we obtained samples from the oral cavity, infected root canal and periapical abscess of 8 patients (5 with localized and 3 with systemic infections). microbial populations in these samples were analyzed using next-generation sequencing of 16s rrna amplicons. bioinformatics tools and statistical tests with rigorous criteria were used to elucidate the spatial transition of the microbiota from normal to diseased sites. results: on average,  10,000 partial 16s rrna gene sequences were obtained from each sample. all sequences fell into 11 different bacterial phyla. the microbial diversity in root canal and abscess samples was significantly lower than in the oral samples. streptococcus was the most abundant genus in oral cavities while prevotella and fusobacterium were most abundant in diseased samples. the microbiota community structures of root canal and abscess samples were, however, more similar to each  other than to the oral cavity microbiota. using rigorous criteria and novel bioinformatics tools, we found that granulicatella adiacens, eubacterium yurii, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella salivae, streptococcus mitis, and atopobium rimae were over-represented in diseased samples. conclusions: we used a novel approach and high-throughput methodologies to characterize the microbiota associated normal and diseased oral sites in the same individuals.
