TI  == metabolic mechanism of mannan in a ruminal bacterium, ruminococcus albus, involving two mannoside phosphorylases and cellobiose 2-epimerase: discovery of a new carbohydrate phosphorylase, beta-1,4-mannooligosaccharide phosphorylase.
AB  == ruminococcus albus is a typical ruminal bacterium digesting cellulose and hemicellulose. cellobiose 2-epimerase (ce; ec 5.1.3.11), which converts cellobiose to 4-o-beta-d-glucosyl-d-mannose, is a particularly unique enzyme in r. albus, but its physiological function is unclear. recently, a new metabolic pathway of mannan involving ce was postulated for another ce-producing bacterium, bacteroides fragilis. in this pathway, beta-1,4-mannobiose is epimerized to 4-o-beta-d-mannosyl-d-glucose (man-glc) by ce, and man-glc is phosphorolyzed to alpha-d-mannosyl 1-phosphate (man1p) and d-glucose by man-glc phosphorylase (mp;  ec 2.4.1.281). ruminococcus albus ne1 showed intracellular mp activity, and two mp isozymes, ramp1 and ramp2, were obtained from the cell-free extract. these enzymes were highly specific for the mannosyl residue at the non-reducing end of  the substrate and catalyzed the phosphorolysis and synthesis of man-glc through a sequential bi bi mechanism. in a synthetic reaction, ramp1 showed high activity only toward d-glucose and 6-deoxy-d-glucose in the presence of man1p, whereas ramp2 showed acceptor specificity significantly different from ramp1. ramp2 acted on d-glucose derivatives at the c2- and c3-positions, including deoxy- and deoxyfluoro-analogues and epimers, but not on those substituted at the c6-position. furthermore, ramp2 had high synthetic activity toward the following  oligosaccharides: beta-linked glucobioses, maltose, n,n'-diacetylchitobiose, and  beta-1,4-mannooligosaccharides. particularly, beta-1,4-mannooligosaccharides served as significantly better acceptor substrates for ramp2 than d-glucose. in the phosphorolytic reactions, ramp2 had weak activity toward beta-1,4-mannobiose  but efficiently degraded beta-1,4-mannooligosaccharides longer than beta-1,4-mannobiose. consequently, ramp2 is thought to catalyze the phosphorolysis of beta-1,4-mannooligosaccharides longer than beta-1,4-mannobiose  to produce man1p and beta-1,4-mannobiose.

TI  == dysbiosis of fecal microbiota in crohn's disease patients as revealed by a custom phylogenetic microarray.
AB  == background: a custom phylogenetic microarray composed of small subunit ribosomal  rna probes, representing approximately 500 bacterial species from the human and animal gut, was developed and evaluated for analysis of gut microbial diversity using fecal samples from healthy subjects and crohn's disease (cd) patients. methods: oligonucleotide probes ( approximately 40 mer) used on the microarray were selected from published articles or designed with the "goarray" microarray probe design program using selected bacterial 16s rrna sequences. fecal 16s rdna  from individual samples of six healthy subjects and six cd patients were used as  template to generate fluorescently labeled crna that was hybridized to the microarray. differences revealed by the microarray in relative abundance of microbial populations between healthy and diseased patients were verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with species-specific primer sets. results: the microarray analyses showed that eubacterium rectale, bacteroides fragilis group, b. vulgatus, ruminococcus albus, r. callidus, r. bromii, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii were 5-10-fold more abundant in the healthy subjects than in the cd patients, while enterococcus sp., clostridium difficile, escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, and listeria sp. were more abundant in the cd group. conclusions: the microarray detected differences in abundance of bacterial populations within the phylum firmicutes that had been reported previously for the same samples based on phylogenetic analysis of metagenomic clone libraries. in addition, the microarray showed that enterococcus sp. was in higher abundance in the cd patients. this microarray should be another useful tool to examine the diversity and abundance of human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == development of a membrane-array method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == a membrane-array method was developed for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples without using the expensive microarray-arrayer and laser-scanner. the 16s rdna sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to nitrocellulose membranes. digoxigenin (dig)-labeled 16s rdnas were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) from human fecal samples or pure cultured bacteria using two universal primers, and were hybridized to the membrane-array. hybridization signals were read by nbt/bcip color development. the 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, b. fragilis, b. distasonis, clostridium clostridiiforme, c. leptum, fusobacterium prausnitzii, peptostreptococcus productus, ruminococcus obeum, r. bromii, r. callidus, r. albus, bifidobacterium  longum, b. adolescentis, b. infantis, eubacterium biforme, e. aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus,escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecium. the two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16s rdna from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. the hybridization results indicated that the membrane-array method is a reliable technique for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples. the result was also confirmed by  using specific pcr methods for these bacteria.

TI  == design and evaluation of oligonucleotide-microarray method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == an oligonucleotide-microarray method was developed for the detection of intestinal bacteria in fecal samples collected from human subjects. the 16s rdna  sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to glass slides. cyanine5 (cy5)-labeled 16s rdnas were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) from human fecal samples or bacterial dna using two universal primers and were hybridized to the oligo-microarray. the 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides vulgatus, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides distasonis, clostridium clostridiiforme, clostridium leptum, fusobacterium prausnitzii, peptostreptococcus productus, ruminococcus obeum, ruminococcus bromii, ruminococcus callidus, ruminococcus albus, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium infantis, eubacterium biforme, eubacterium aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus, escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecium. the two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16s rdna from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. the hybridization results indicated that the oligo-microarray method developed in this study is a reliable method for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples.
