TI  == gut metabolites and bacterial community networks during a pilot intervention study with flaxseeds in healthy adult men.
AB  == scope: flaxseeds contain the phytoestrogens lignans that must be activated to enterolignans by intestinal bacteria. we investigated the impact of flaxseeds on  fecal bacterial communities and their associations with fecal and blood metabolites. methods and results: nine healthy male adult subjects ingested 0.3 g/kg/day flaxseeds during 1 week. gut bacteria as well as blood and fecal metabolites were analyzed. ingestion of flaxseeds triggered a significant increase in the blood concentration of enterolignans, accompanied by fecal excretion of propionate and glycerol. overall diversity and composition of dominant fecal bacteria remained individual specific throughout the study. enterolactone production was linked to the abundance of two molecular species identified as ruminococcus bromii and ruminococcus lactaris. most dominant species of the order bacteroidales were positively associated with fecal concentrations of either acetic, isovaleric, or isobutyric acid, the latter being negatively correlated with blood levels of triglycerides. the relative sequence abundance of one gemmiger species (ruminococcaceae) and of coprococcus comes (lachnospiraceae) correlated positively with blood levels of ldl cholesterol and  triglycerides, respectively. conclusion: flaxseeds increase enterolignan production but do not markedly alter fecal metabolome and dominant bacterial communities. the data underline the possible role of members of the family ruminococcaceae in the regulation of enterolignan production and blood lipids.

TI  == selective colonization of insoluble substrates by human faecal bacteria.
AB  == insoluble plant polysaccharides and endogenous mucin are important energy sources for human colonic microorganisms. the object of this study was to determine whether or not specific communities colonize these substrates. using faecal samples from four individuals as inocula for an anaerobic in vitro continuous flow system, the colonization of wheat bran, high amylose starch and porcine gastric mucin was examined. recovered substrates were extensively washed and the  remaining tightly attached bacterial communities were identified using polymerase chain reaction-amplified 16s rrna gene sequences and fluorescent in situ hybridization. the substrate had a major influence on the species of attached bacteria detected. sequences retrieved from bran were dominated by clostridial cluster xiva bacteria, including uncultured relatives of clostridium hathewayi, eubacterium rectale and roseburia species. bacteroides species were also detected. the most abundant sequences recovered from starch were related to the cultured species ruminococcus bromii, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium breve and e. rectale. the most commonly recovered sequences from  mucin were from bifidobacterium bifidum and uncultured bacteria related to ruminococcus lactaris. this study suggests that a specific subset of bacteria is  likely to be the primary colonizers of particular insoluble colonic substrates. for a given substrate, however, the primary colonizing species may vary between host individuals.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis by 16s ribosomal dna sequence comparison reveals two unrelated groups of species within the genus ruminococcus.
AB  == phylogenetic analysis of the genus ruminococcus based on 16s rdna sequence data showed the genus to be phylogenetically heterogenous. ruminococcus species fall within the radiation of the bacillus/clostridium subphylum of the gram-positive line of descent. two distinct and unrelated clusters are recovered. one group contains r. flavefaciens, r. albus, r. bromii, and r. callidus. the second group  constitutes r. gnavus, r. hansenii, r. lactaris, r. obeum, r. productus and r. torques which together with some clostridium species may constitute a new genus.
