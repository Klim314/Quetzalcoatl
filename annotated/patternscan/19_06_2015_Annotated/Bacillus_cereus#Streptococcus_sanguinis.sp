TI  == design, structural and spectroscopic elucidation, and the in vitro biological activities of new diorganotin dithiocarbamates.
AB  == the reaction of 2,2-dimethoxy-n-methylethyllamine or 2-methyl-1,3-dioxolane with  cs(2) in alkaline media produced two novel dithiocarbamate salts. subsequent reactions with organotin halides yielded six new complexes: [snme(2){s(2)cnr(r(1))(2)}(2)] (1), [sn(n-bu)(2){s(2)cnr(r(1))(2)}(2)] (2), [snph(2){s(2)cnr(r(1))(2)}(2)] (3), [snme(2){s(2)cnr(r(2))(2)}(2)] (4), [sn(n-bu)(2){s(2)cnr(r(2))(2)}(2)] (5), [snph(2){s(2)cnr(r(2))(2)}(2)] (6), where r = methyl, r(1) = ch(2)ch(ome)(2), and r(2) = 2-methyl-1,3-dioxolane. all compounds were identified in terms of infrared, (1)h and (13)c nmr, and the complexes were also characterized using (119)sn nmr, (119)sn mossbauer and x-ray  crystallography. the biological activity of all derivatives has been screened in  terms of ic(90) and ic(50) against aspergillus flavus, aspergillus niger, aspergillus parasiticus, penicillium citrinum, curvularia senegalensis, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, streptococcus sanguinis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, salmonella typhimurium, and pseudomonas aeruginosa and the results correlated well with a performed study of  structure-activity relationship (sar). complexes (3), (5) and (6) displayed the best ic(90) and ic(50) in the presence of the fungi, greater than that of miconazole, used as control drug.

TI  == novel bacterial lipoprotein structures conserved in low-gc content gram-positive  bacteria are recognized by toll-like receptor 2.
AB  == bacterial lipoproteins/lipopeptides inducing host innate immune responses are sensed by mammalian toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2). these bacterial lipoproteins are structurally divided into two groups, diacylated or triacylated lipoproteins, by  the absence or presence of an amide-linked fatty acid. the presence of diacylated lipoproteins has been predicted in low-gc content gram-positive bacteria and mycoplasmas based on the absence of one modification enzyme in their genomes; however, we recently determined triacylated structures in low-gc gram-positive staphylococcus aureus, raising questions about the actual lipoprotein structure in other low-gc content gram-positive bacteria. here, through intensive ms analyses, we identified a novel and unique bacterial lipoprotein structure containing an n-acyl-s-monoacyl-glyceryl-cysteine (named the lyso structure) from low-gc gram-positive enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, streptococcus sanguinis, and lactobacillus bulgaricus. two of the purified native lyso-form lipoproteins induced proinflammatory cytokine production from mice macrophages in a tlr2-dependent and tlr1-independent manner but with a different dependence on tlr6. additionally, two other new lipoprotein structures were identified. one is  the "n-acetyl" lipoprotein structure containing n-acetyl-s-diacyl-glyceryl-cysteine, which was found in five gram-positive bacteria, including bacillus subtilis. the n-acetyl lipoproteins induced the proinflammatory cytokines through the tlr2/6 heterodimer. the other was identified in a mycoplasma strain and is an unusual diacyl lipoprotein structure  containing two amino acids before the lipid-modified cysteine residue. taken together, our results suggest the existence of novel tlr2-stimulating lyso and n-acetyl forms of lipoproteins that are conserved in low-gc content gram-positive bacteria and provide clear evidence for the presence of yet to be identified key  enzymes involved in the bacterial lipoprotein biosynthesis.

TI  == binding of porcine ficolin-alpha to lipopolysaccharides from gram-negative bacteria and lipoteichoic acids from gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == protein(s) reactive with n-acetyl-d-glucosamine (glcnac) was isolated from porcine nonimmune serum. the molecular weight of the purified protein was found to be mainly 40 kda on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  under reducing conditions. the n-terminal 10 amino acid sequence of the purified  protein were found to be identical to that of porcine ficolin-alpha reported previously. in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the purified protein was found  to react with lipopolysaccharides (lps) from different gram-negative bacteria such as esherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella enteritidis, salmonella abortus equi, pseudomonas aeruginosa, shigella flexeneri, and serratia marcescens and with lipoteichoic acid (lta) from gram-positive bacteria such as streptococcus sanguis, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus. the purified protein also reacted with e. coli o26 isolated from food poisoning and bovine feces and heat-treated gram-positive bacteria such as s. aureus, b. cereus, b. subtilis, enterococcus faecium, and corynebacterum bovis. on the other hand, porcine igg isolated from nonimmune serum showed different reactivity with these lps, lta, and heat-treated bacterial cells. from the present findings, purified porcine serum protein reactive with glcnac is concluded to be ficolin-alpha playing an important role(s) in innate immunity against microbial infection with gram-positive and -negative bacteria.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria from healthy oral cavity of thai volunteers: inhibition of oral pathogens.
AB  == the aims of the present study were to screen and characterize the antimicrobial lactic acid bacteria which were isolated from healthy oral cavities of thai volunteers, and to characterize their inhibiting substances. among 3790 isolates  (suspected to be lactic acid bacteria) from 130 volunteers, five showed an appreciable effect against sarcina lutea atcc 9341, bacillus cereus atcc 11778, escherichia coli atcc 25922, staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538, streptococcus mutans dtmu 1, strep. salivarius dtmu 1, strep. sanguis dtmu 1, candida albicans  atcc 13803 and c. albicans dtmu 2, as well as the oral pathogens. these antimicrobial isolates included l17 and n14 which showed the antibacterial activity, d14 which showed the anticandidal activity, and d6 and n8 which showed  both the antibacterial and anticandidal activities. the isolates were later found to be facultative anaerobic, gram-positive, non-spore-forming, non-capsule-forming and catalase-negative bacilli. they could utilize casein but  could not hydrolyse starch, and they produced hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocins. their antimicrobial potentials were found to be affected by ph, catalase, proteolytic enzymes and temperature. the activity was partially inactivated after catalase treatment, significantly declined at ph > or =9.0 or after trypsin and pepsin treatments, and also reduced after heating at > or =100 degrees c. however, the antimicrobial activity of these five isolates was somewhat resistant to heat. when the isolates were tested for their antimicrobial sensitivity, they  were shown to be sensitive to a number of antimicrobial agents. the final identification revealed that d6, d14 and n14 were lactobacillus paracasei subsp.  paracasei, and l17 and n8 were lact. rhamnosus.

TI  == novel automated microbial screening of platelet concentrates.
AB  == the recovery of bacteria and the speed of detection of microbial growth in platelet concentrates (pc) were studied, comparing a novel automated blood culture system (bact/alert) with two traditional methods. full-scale experiments  were performed with a total of 33 units of pc (average content 320 x 10(9) platelets per unit) obtained from pooled buffy coats. six strains known as possible pc contaminants were tested: s. epidermidis, s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, b. cereus, e. aerogenes, and s. sanguis. using an inoculum of 50-98 bacteria/ml,  bacterial contamination was detected in all of 11 pcs on 132 sampling occasions.  with a small inoculum (0.3-9 bacteria/ml), the bacterial contamination was detected in all pcs in which abundant growth appeared, but failed to be detected  in some instances where the bacterial content was very small. all of 11 uninoculated pc controls were negative. with the automated method the time for detection of a culture-positive pc was 6-16 h, clearly shorter than with the two  manual-visual systems. the new system provides a rapid, reliable, and labour-saving method for screening of bacterial contamination in pcs. this would  increase safety particularly if the present 5-day shelf life were extended.

TI  == metabolism of 17 beta-estradiol by oral streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, bacillus cereus and candida albicans.
AB  == the ability of oral isolates of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, bacillus cereus and candida albicans to metabolize 17 beta-estradiol was analyzed by thin-layer chromatography using 4-14c-estradiol as the substrate. all test microorganisms metabolized 17 beta-estradiol. estrone was the main metabolic product, except for b. cereus, which converted 17 beta-estradiol mainly to unidentified, more polar metabolites. s. sanguis and b. cereus had the most active metabolism but s. mutans and c. albicans were also active.

TI  == bactericidal action of carbon dioxide laser radiation in experimental dental root canals.
AB  == the ability of a carbon dioxide laser to sterilize the root canal of human teeth  has been investigated. three oral bacteria, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus  mutans, and actinomyces viscosus, and three other bacteria, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were used as experimental organisms. exposure of cells on glass slides to laser radiation showed there was  little difference in the exposure required to kill these six organisms. complete  recovery of bacteria from the root canal was initially a problem and was only achieved when bacterial manipulations and removal were carried out in rapid succession, within 5 min of inoculation. however, the geometry of the instrumented canal and the laser alignment were major factors in achieving consistent cell death of oral bacteria in the root canals. using sets of 10 teeth, four repeated exposures of 10 w for 1 s was found to sterilize 4 or more of the teeth.

TI  == [effect of solid substrates of microbial colony development].
AB  == bacteria have been found to grow differently at contact sites to both organic and anorganic solids as on pure agar media. of 16 ad hoc selected bacterial strains,  the following species (arranged in decreasing order) responded with stronger colony formation: bacillus subtilis, b. cereus, streptococcus sanguis, s. saprophyticus, s. faecalis, escherichia coli, micrococcus flavus, actinomyces viscosus, veillonella sp., enterobacter liquefaciens, yersinia enterocolitica. lactobacillus casei behaved neutral. proteus vulgaris, y. enterocolitica and chromobacterium violaceum grow on certain media only in the presence of solid particles. the yeasts endomyces lactis, saccharomyces cerevisiae, rhodotorula mucilaginosa and cryptococcus nigricans did not respond to solid particles during colony formation. the kind of protein-animal (meat) or vegetable (soy beans)-did  not influence the behaviour of the microorganisms in these experiments.
