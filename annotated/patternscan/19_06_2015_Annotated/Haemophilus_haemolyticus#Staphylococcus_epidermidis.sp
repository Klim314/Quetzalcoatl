TI  == microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of may bryndza cheese.
AB  == diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of may bryndza cheese, a traditional slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, e. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16s rdna and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. the culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese,  lactobacilli, lactococci and geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) cfu/g, 10(9) cfu/g and 10(5) cfu/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. the diversity of bacteria encompassed acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter guillouiae, acinetobacter sp., acinetobacter johnsonii, citrobacter braakii, clostridium bartlettii, corynebacterium callunae, corynebacterium maris, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter asburiae, enterobacter hormaechei, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus pallens, escherichia  coli, haemophilus haemolyticus, hafnia alvei, kluyvera cryocrescens, lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus garvieae, lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "leuconostoc garlicum", mannheimia glucosida, mannheimia haemolytica, pseudomonas sp., ps. fluorescens, "ps. reactans", raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, "rothia arfidiae", staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis, staph. felis, staph. pasteuri, staph. sciuri, staph. xylosus, streptococcus parauberis, str. thermophilus and variovorax paradoxus. the diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed alternaria alternata, "ascomycete sp.", aspergillus fumigatus, beauveria brongniartii, candida xylopsoci, c. inconspicua, cladosporium cladosporioides, debaromyces hansenii, fomes fomentarius, galactomyces candidus, gymnoascus reesii, chaetomium globosum, kluyveromyces marxianus, metarhizium anisopliae, penicillium aurantiogriseum, p. camemberti, p. freii, p. polonicum, p. viridicatum, pichia kudriavzevii, sordaria alcina, trichosporon lactis and yarrowia lipolytica.

TI  == neonatal community-acquired pneumonia: pathogens and treatment.
AB  == aim: to analyse the bacterial pathogens and drug sensitivities for neonatal community-acquired pneumonia. methods: seven hundred sixty sputum samples from newborns with community-acquired pneumonia were cultured to determine microbial organisms present and their drug sensitivities. results: of the 760 specimens, 425 grew pathogens for a 55.9% positive rate. among the 425 positive cultures, 278 grew gram-negative organisms (65.4%), 142 grew gram-positive organisms (33.3%), while 5 grew fungus (1.3%). the most common gram-negative organisms were escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and hemophilus influenzae, while the most common gram-positive organisms were staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus. to the gram-negative organisms, the  most sensitive drugs were meropenem, imipenem and amikacin, while to the gram-positive ones were vancomycin, teicoplanin and quinupristin/dalfopristin. conclusions: the most common causative bacteria were gram-negative organisms, which were highly sensitive to meropenem, imipenem and amikacin, yet often treatable with more focused antibiotic coverage, which depended on the bacterium  identified.

TI  == pd-140248 (parke-davis & co).
AB  == pd-140248 is an isomerase inhibitor and topoisomerase ii inhibitor under development by parke-davis and co as a potential treatment for bacterial infection. although no details of active development have been published in the scientific literature since 1996, in september 1999, the company confirmed that pd-140248 is still in active development [338530]. the compound is one of two new pyrrolidinyl naphthyridines (the other compound being pd-131628) with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, including activity against quinolone-resistant bacteria. pd-140248 demonstrates strong in vitro activity, particularly against gram-positive bacteria, such as quinolone-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (s aureus), staphylococcus epidermidis (s epidermidis), staphylococcus haemolyticus (s haemolyticus), methicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant s aureus, streptococcus species, streptococcus pneumoniae (s pneumoniae) and enterococcus faecalis (e faecalis). an mic90 value of 0.015 microg/ml was obtained against haemophilus influenzae (h influenzae) and moraxella catarrhalis [160129]. the (3r,1s) enantiomer, pd-140248, demonstrated a 1- to 10-fold enhanced activity against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms in vitro and in vivo compared to its stereoisomers, and has thus been targeted for further preclinical studies [133377].

TI  == the binding of mbl to common bacteria in infectious diseases of children.
AB  == objective: to purify mannan-binding lectin (mbl) from human serum and detect its  binding ability to several kinds of bacteria common in infectious diseases of children. methods: mbl was purified from human serum by affinity chromatography on mannan-sepharose 4b column. its binding ability to eight species, 97 strains of bacteria was detected by enzyme-linked lectin assay (ella). results: mbl has different binding ability to bacteria and shows strong binding ability to klebsiella ornithinolytica and escherichia coli, but shows relatively lower binding ability to staphylococcus haemolyticus, enterobacter cloacae and staphylococcus epidermidis. to different isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and staphylococcus aureus, mbl shows quite different binding ability. conclusions: mbl has different binding ability to different bacteria, and has relatively stronger binding ability to gram-negative bacteria.  its binding ability to different isolates of certain kinds of bacteria is quite different.

TI  == sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles in the detection of cornea organ culture media contamination by bacteria and fungi.
AB  == aims: to test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. methods: the bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 iu/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin b was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees c with five inocula of 14 bacteria. two yeasts  (candida spp) and one aspergillus were also tested. contaminated media were then  inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened  daily by visual inspection. the sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. results: organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria  irrespective of the starting inoculums: streptococcus pneumoniae, branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, propionibacterium acnes, and haemophilus influenzae. for micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal  only (methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, bacillus subtilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans, candida kruzei, aspergillus  fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (sd 13.8, range 2-52). in cases of detection by the  blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. conclusions: blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.

TI  == in vitro activities of rwj-54428 (mc-02,479) against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == rwj-54428 (mc-02,479) is a new cephalosporin with a high level of activity against gram-positive bacteria. in a broth microdilution susceptibility test against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), rwj-54428 was as active as vancomycin, with an mic at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic(90)) of 2 microg/ml. for coagulase-negative staphylococci, rwj-54428 was 32  times more active than imipenem, with an mic(90) of 2 microg/ml. rwj-54428 was active against s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides (rwj-54428 mic range, < or = 0.0625 to 1 microg/ml). rwj-54428 was eight times more potent than  methicillin and cefotaxime against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mic(90), 0.5 microg/ml). for ampicillin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant and high-level aminoglycoside-resistant strains), rwj-54428  had an mic(90) of 0.125 microg/ml. rwj-54428 was also active against enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-, gentamicin-, and ciprofloxacin-resistant strains. the potency against enterococci correlated with ampicillin susceptibility; rwj-54428 mics ranged between < or = 0.0625 and 1 microg/ml for ampicillin-susceptible strains and 0.125 and 8 microg/ml for ampicillin-resistant strains. rwj-54428 was more active than penicillin g and cefotaxime against penicillin-resistant, -intermediate, and -susceptible strains of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90)s, 0.25, 0.125, and < or = 0.0625 microg/ml, respectively). rwj-54428 was only marginally active against most gram-negative bacteria; however, significant activity was observed against haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis (mic(90)s, 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively). this survey of the susceptibilities of more than 1,000 multidrug-resistant gram-positive isolates to rwj-54428 indicates that this new cephalosporin has the potential to be useful in the treatment of infections due to gram-positive bacteria, including strains resistant to currently available antimicrobials.

TI  == neonatal airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli: association with severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  == background: airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli (gnb) and gram-positive cocci (gpc) is common in mechanically ventilated neonates. whether  gnb are related to nosocomial bloodstream infection (bsi) and/or to the severity  of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (bpd) is unknown. methods: we prospectively examine this relationship using a cohort design. data from 260 < or = 1250-g birth weight inborn infants (1991 to 1995) intubated > or = 2 weeks included 917 serial tracheal cultures and 583 blood cultures. the severity of bpd was assessed by duration of mechanical ventilation, oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and the use of home oxygen supplementation. results: after 2 weeks of ventilation, 80% of the infants were colonized with gpc (staphylococus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus in 90% of the cases). superimposed on 36% of these infants was gnb airway colonization with klebsiella pneumoniae (25%), enterobacter cloacae (25%), escherichia coli (25%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%), serratia marcescen (10%), acinetobacter baumannii and haemophilus influenzae (5%). comparison between 174 gpc- and 86 gnb-colonized infants showed  that demographics, birth weight, gestational age, perinatal risk factors and mortality were similar. fifteen percent of gnb-colonized infants developed bsi caused by gnb and 14% developed bsi caused by gpc. no significant temporal relationship between airway colonization and bsi was noted. gnb infants were ventilated longer and required oxygen at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and home oxygen supplementation twice as often as infants colonized only with gpc. gnb colonization was a predictor of severe bpd after controlling for ventilation. ureaplasma colonization occurred in 28% of gnb-colonized and 33% of noncolonized  infants and was not a predictor of bpd severity. conclusion: gnb airway colonization creates a moderate risk for bsi. antibiotic treatment does not regularly eradicate gnb. gnb airway colonization is associated with severe bpd, but further studies will be necessary before therapeutic efforts to eradicate gnb from the airways should be undertaken.

TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of cs-940, a new trifluorinated quinolone.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of cs-940, a new trifluorinated quinolone drug, was tested against 761 clinical isolates. cs-940 activity against members of the family enterobacteriaceae was most similar to that of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, with a large range of mics inhibiting 90% of isolates tested (mic90s)  of 0.015 to 16 micrograms/ml (median mic90, 0.06 micrograms/ml). cs-940 had greater activity than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin when they were tested against acinetobacter spp. (mic90s, 0.03 micrograms/ml) and stenotrophomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia (mic90s, 2 micrograms/ml). cs-940 demonstrated a high degree of potency against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and neisseria spp. (mic90s, < or = 0.06 micrograms/ml). cs-940 was two- to eightfold  more active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, and coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. cs-940 was also very active against streptococcus spp. and enterococci, for which mic90s were < or = 2 micrograms/ml; for enterococcus faecium, however, the mic90 was 4 micrograms/ml. cs-940 was generally less active than a comparison investigational fluoroquinolone, clinafloxacin. this compound appears promising by in vitro test analysis and warrants further in vivo trials.

TI  == in vitro activity of ro 23-9424, a dual-action antibacterial agent, against bacterial isolates from cancer patients compared with those of other agents.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ro 23-9424 against bacterial isolates from patients with cancer was compared with those of fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, cefoperazone, and ceftazidime. ro 23-9424 inhibited the majority of the members of the family enterobacteriaceae and all aeromonas isolates at a concentration of less than or  equal to 1.0 micrograms/ml. it was also active against acinetobacter spp. and haemophilus influenzae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. the mic for 90% of isolates (mic90) of pseudomonas aeruginosa was 16.0 micrograms/ml. all group a and b streptococci were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml, and 90% of group g streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae were  inhibited by 1.0 micrograms/ml. all methicillin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus and 60% of methicillin-resistant strains were susceptible to 2.0 micrograms of ro 23-9424 per ml, whereas the mic90 for staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus hominis isolates was 4.0 micrograms/ml. staphylococcus haemolyticus and enterococcus spp. were less susceptible; mic90s for them were 16.0 and 32.0 micrograms/ml. ro 23-9424 has a broad antibacterial spectrum and potential utility for therapy of infections in cancer patients.
