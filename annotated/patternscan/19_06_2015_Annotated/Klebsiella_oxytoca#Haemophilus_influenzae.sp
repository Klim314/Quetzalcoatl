TI  == pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluation of ceftaroline fosamil.
AB  == introduction: ceftaroline fosamil is a 5th generation cephalosporin with an in vitro spectrum of activity including streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. aureus, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella oxytoca, k. pneumoniae and moraxella catarrhalis. it is currently approved by the fda for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (absssi) and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (cabp) in adults. areas covered: this review covers the mechanism of action; bacterial resistance; pharmacokinetic characteristics in various patient populations; pharmacodynamic data in animal and in vitro models as well as human studies; efficacy observed in clinical trials for absssi and cabp; and adverse effects. expert opinion: ceftaroline provides in vitro bactericidal activity against methicillin-, vancomycin-, daptomycin-, and linezolid-resistant gram-positive organisms and select gram-negative pathogens. the pharmacodynamics of ceftaroline is similar to other beta-lactam agents. ceftaroline exhibits a favorable adverse effect profile and is generally well tolerated. there is little data on clinical success of ceftaroline in patients with bacteremia or endocarditis other than what has been  published in a small series of case reports. randomized-control studies are needed to establish clinical outcomes and safety in these patient populations.

TI  == ceftaroline activity against organisms isolated from respiratory tract infections in usa hospitals: results from the aware program, 2009-2011.
AB  == the assessing worldwide antimicrobial resistance evaluation program monitors the  activity of ceftaroline and comparator agents tested against pathogens causing either respiratory or skin and soft tissue infections. a total of 7733 isolates from patients in 80 medical centers across the united states (usa) identified as  respiratory tract pathogens by the infection type and/or specimen site recorded by the submitting laboratory during 2009-2011 were evaluated. there were 3360 isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae, 1799 haemophilus influenzae, 1087 staphylococcus aureus, 678 moraxella catarrhalis, 459 klebsiella pneumoniae, 223  escherichia coli, and 127 klebsiella oxytoca. annual penicillin resistance among  s. pneumoniae ranged from 21.9 to 24.3%. all s. pneumoniae strains were inhibited at a ceftaroline mic of </=0.5 mug/ml with 100.0% of isolates categorized as susceptible. ceftaroline was 16-fold more active than ceftriaxone and 32-fold more active than amoxicillin-clavulanate against penicillin-resistant pneumococci. only 49.8% of the penicillin-resistant isolates were susceptible to  ceftriaxone. there were a total of 1087 s. aureus (48.9% methicillin-resistant s. aureus [mrsa]) isolates, and the yearly mrsa rate ranged from 47.9 to 49.7%. the  ceftaroline mic50/90 for s. aureus was at 0.25/1 mug/ml; 98.2% susceptible and no resistant strains (>/=4 mug/ml). ceftaroline activity against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) isolates (mic50 and mic90, 0.25 and 0.25 mug/ml, respectively; 100% susceptible) was 2- to 4-fold greater than for mrsa (mic50/90, 0.5/1 mug/ml; 96.2% susceptible). the ceftriaxone mic90 for mssa was 4 mug/ml. ceftaroline was active against h. influenzae (mic50/90 </=0.015/0.03 mug/ml; 100.0% susceptible) and against m. catarrhalis (mic50/90, 0.06/0.12 mug/ml). ceftaroline was active against non-extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) phenotype strains of enterobacteriaceae but not against esbl-positive phenotype strains. in summary, ceftaroline was highly active against a large collection of bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with respiratory tract infections in the usa during 2009 through 2011.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the canward surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 canadian hospitals from january 2010 to december 2012. in total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution method (document m07-a9, 2012), with mics interpreted by using clsi breakpoints (document m100-s23, 2013). ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (mic90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca,  proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii, and haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, c. freundii, and h. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to clsi mic interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (p. mirabilis) to 54.0% (s. marcescens). all isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates (mic90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity  against staphylococci or streptococci. all isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 0.03 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and streptococcus agalactiae (mic90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. we conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of enterobacteriaceae resistant to  third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)- and ampc-producing e. coli and esbl-producing k. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.

TI  == [antimicrobial susceptibilityof clinical isolates of aerobic gram-negative bacteria in 2008].
AB  == we determined mics of antibacterial agents against 1145 clinical strains of aerobic gram-negative bacteria (22 species) isolated at 16 japanese facilities in 2008. mics were determined using mostly broth microdilution method and antibacterial activity was assessed. strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) accounted for 3.8% of escherichia coli, 2.6% of klebsiella pneumoniae, 6.8% of klebsiella oxytoca, 5.5% of proteus mirabilis and 1.8% of proteus vulgaris. esbl produced strains were 6.8% at k. oxytoca that increased compared with 3.2% and 5.5% at p. mirabilis that decreased compared with 18.8% in 2006. among haemophilus influenzae, 61.7% that decreased compared with 67.7% in 2006, equaled 58.7% in 2004, were strains when classified by penicillin-binding protein 3 mutation. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, the activity of most antibacterial agents was similar to that in 2006. although two antibacterial agents that tobramycin showed an mic90 of 1 microg/ml and doripenem showed an mic90 of 4 microg/ml against p. aeruginosa have potent activity. of all p. aeruginosa strains, 4.3% were resistant to six agents of nine antipseudomonal agents, that decreased compared to 12.2% in 2004 and 5.7% in 2006. against other  glucose-non-fermentative gram-negative rods, the activity of most antibacterial agents was similar to that in 2006.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftaroline against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated from patients in canadian hospitals in 2009.
AB  == the in vitro activities of ceftaroline and comparative agents were determined for a collection of the most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens from hospital-associated patients across canada in 2009 as part of the ongoing canward surveillance study. in total, 4,546 isolates from 15 sentinel canadian hospital laboratories were tested using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution method. compared with other cephalosporins, including  ceftobiprole, cefepime, and ceftriaxone, ceftaroline exhibited the greatest potency against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), with a mic(9)(0) of 0.25 mug/ml. ceftaroline also demonstrated greater potency than ceftobiprole against community-associated methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa)  (mic(9)(0), 0.5 mug/ml) and health care-associated mrsa (mic(9)(0), 1 mug/ml) and was at least 4-fold more active than other cephalosporins against staphylococcus  epidermidis; all isolates of mssa and mrsa tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (mic, </=1 mug/ml). against streptococci, including streptococcus pneumoniae, ceftaroline mics (mic(9)(0), </=0.03 mug/ml) were comparable to those of ceftobiprole; however, against penicillin-nonsusceptible, macrolide-nonsusceptible, and multidrug-nonsusceptible isolates of s. pneumoniae, ceftaroline demonstrated 2- to 4-fold and 4- to 16-fold more potent activities than those of ceftobiprole and ceftriaxone, respectively. all isolates of s. pneumoniae tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (mic, </=0.25 mug/ml). among gram-negative isolates, ceftaroline demonstrated potent activity (mic(9)(0), </=0.5 mug/ml) against escherichia coli (92.2% of isolates were susceptible), klebsiella pneumoniae (94.1% of isolates were susceptible), proteus mirabilis (97.7% of isolates were susceptible), and haemophilus influenzae (100% of isolates were susceptible). ceftaroline demonstrated less potent activity (mic(9)(0), >/=4 mug/ml) against enterobacter spp., acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella oxytoca, serratia marcescens, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. overall, ceftaroline demonstrated potent in vitro activity against a recent collection of the most frequently encountered gram-positive and gram-negative isolates from patients attending hospitals across canada in 2009.

TI  == recurrent hemolacria: a sign of scleral buckle infection.
AB  == purpose: the purpose of this study was to report recurrent hemolacria, or "bloody tears," as a sign of scleral buckle (sb) infection. methods: this is an interventional case series of three eyes of three patients with hemolacria after  sb placement. results: two men and one woman were treated for recurrent hemolacria after sb placement for a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. two patients had an encircling silicone sponge placed, one 6 years and the other 3 years before presentation. the third patient had a segmental solid silicone element placed 3 months before presentation. two of the patients reported between 6 to 10 episodes of hemolacria occurring for "years" before referral and diagnosis. in all three patients, hemolacria originated from an occult conjunctival fistula overlying or adjacent to an exposed sb. microbiological cultures grew staphylococcus aureus in two eyes and polymicrobial growth in the other. hemolacria resolved with explantation of the sb in two patients and with long-term continuous topical antibiotics in the other patient. conclusion: hemolacria can be a sign of a sb infection and should raise a high level of suspicion for the presence of an occult conjunctival fistula with exposure of the underlying scleral buckling element when frank exposure is not seen.

TI  == characterization of three new competence-regulated operons in haemophilus influenzae.
AB  == haemophilus influenzae is one of a growing number of bacteria in which the natural ability to uptake exogenous dna for potential genomic transformation has  been recognized. to date, several operons involved in transformation in this organism have been described. these operons are characterized by a conserved 22-bp regulatory element upstream of the first gene and are induced coincident with transfer from rich to nutrient-depleted media. the previously identified operons comprised genes encoding proteins that include members of the type ii secretion system and type iv pili, shown to be essential for transformation in other bacteria, and other proteins previously identified as required for transformation in h. influenzae. in the present study, three novel competence operons were identified by comparative genomics and transcriptional analysis. these operons have been further characterized by construction of null mutants and examination of the resulting transformation phenotypes. the putative protein encoded by the hi0366 gene was shown to be essential for dna uptake, but not binding, and is homologous to a protein shown to be required for pilus biogenesis and twitching motility in pseudomonas aeruginosa. an insertion in hi0939 abolished both dna binding and uptake. the predicted product of this gene shares  characteristics with pulj, a pseudopilin involved in pullulanase export in klebsiella oxytoca.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. changes in czop susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, serratia liquefaciens, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter iwoffii,  burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, bacteroides fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas. czop preserved its antibacterial activity against m. (b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the  mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and  0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity  of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of  czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

TI  == ceftriaxone activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated in us clinical microbiology laboratories from 1996 to 2000: results from the surveillance network (tsn) database-usa.
AB  == ceftriaxone was introduced into clinical practice in the usa in 1985 and was the  first extended-spectrum (third-generation) cephalosporin approved for once-daily  treatment of patients with gram-positive or gram-negative infections. review of ceftriaxone activity is important given its continued use since the mid-1980s and reports of emerging resistance among all antimicrobial agent classes. we reviewed the activity of ceftriaxone and relevant comparative agents against five gram-positive and 11 gram-negative species for a 5-year period, 1996-2000, using  data from the surveillance network (tsn) database-usa. all mic results were interpreted using nccls breakpoint criteria. ceftriaxone resistance among isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (n=17219) remained essentially unchanged over the 5 years studied and in fact was lower from 1998 to 2000 (5.0-5.1%) than  in 1996 (6.3%) and 1997 (6.6%). ceftriaxone resistance (range, 5.1-6.9%) among viridans group streptococci (n=6621) varied by <2% from 1997 to 2000. beta-lactam-resistant streptococcus pyogenes (n=935) and group b beta-haemolytic  streptococci (n=2267) were not identified in any year. among methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (n=39 284) ceftriaxone resistance was 0.1-0.3% per year from 1996 to 2000. ceftriaxone resistance among escherichia coli (n=472407; range, 0.2-0.4%), klebsiella oxytoca (n=16231; range, 3.5-4.8%),  klebsiella pneumoniae (n=117754; range, 1.9-2.6%), proteus mirabilis (n=67692; range, 0.2-0.3%), morganella morganii (n=11251; range, 0.3-2.1%) and serratia marcescens (n=26519; range, 1.6-3.8%) was low and consistent from 1996 to 2000. resistance to ceftriaxone among enterobacter cloacae (n=48114; range, 21.7-23.9%) was relatively high, compared with other enterobacteriaceae, but unchanged from 1996 to 2000. rates of resistance to ceftriaxone among acinetobacter spp. (n=20813) increased from 24.8% in 1996 to 45.1% in 2000. all haemophilus influenzae (n=7911) and neisseria gonorrhoeae (n=218) were susceptible to ceftriaxone, as were 99.7% of moraxella catarrhalis (n=312) tested in 1996 and 1997. in summary, ceftriaxone has retained its potent activity against the most commonly encountered gram-positive and gram-negative human pathogens despite widespread and ongoing clinical use for more than 15 years.

AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. changes in czop susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), escherichia coli (n = 276), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), enterobacter  aerogenes (n = 93), serratia marcescens (n = 172), serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), citrobacter freundii (n = 177), citrobacter koseri (n = 70), proteus mirabilis (n = 113), proteus vulgaris (n = 89), morganella morganii (n = 116), providencia spp. (n = 41), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), pseudomonas putida (n = 63), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and prevotella/porphyromonas (n = 173). an antibacterial activity of czop against e.  coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, and s. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against m.(b.) catarrhalis, c. koseri, and p. aeruginosa  was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, and p. mirabilis increased year by year. the increase in mic90 of czop against e. aerogenes and p. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. in contract, the susceptibility of e. cloacae  to czop was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to czop. mic90 of czop against c. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. additionally, mic90 of czop against h. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little  higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. an antibacterial activity of czop against p. fluorescens, p. putida, b. cepacia, s.  maltophilia, b. fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. changes in mic90 of czop against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a north american surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == production of n-acyl homoserine lactones by gram-negative bacteria isolated from  contact lens wearers.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate the production of n-acyl-homoserine  lactone (ahl) signal molecules in ocular gram-negative bacteria. a total of 91 ocular strains isolated from contact lens adverse response patients and asymptomatic subjects were used in the study. these included acinetobacter, aeromonas hydrophila, escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella oxytoca, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia liquefaciens, serratia marcescens, and  stenotrophomonas maltophilia. the biosensor strains chromobacterium violaceum mutant cv026 and agrobacterium tumefaciens a136 were used for detection of ahl signal molecules. the majority of a. hydrophila, p. aeruginosa, and s. liquefaciens strains produced more than one ahl molecule. serratia marcescens strains were ahl positive only under detection of a136. the rest of the test species did not show any ahl production under the current detection system. these findings indicate that ahl-mediated quorum-sensing systems are present in some of the ocular bacteria, and the different signal molecules may be involved with the  quorum-sensing pathway in the other bacterial species.

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the usa.
AB  == the antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (sb-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 gram-positive and 995 gram-negative organisms collected from various usa sites. time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (pae) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) 0. 016 mg/l), streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/l), streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/l), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/l), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  (0.03 mg/l), staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/l), staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/l). against gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. mic(90)s for gemifloxacin were: haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008  mg/l), moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/l), escherichia coli (0.016 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/l), klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/l), enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/l), enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/l), proteus spp. (4 mg/l), serratia spp. (1 mg/l), citrobacter freundii (2 mg/l), morganella morganii (0.12  mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/l), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/l) and acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/l). gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x mic. the pae for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at  2 and 4 x mic, although longer paes were observed with h. influenzae, p. aeruginosa and proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x mic) and shorter paes with e. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and k. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). in conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. it has substantially improved potency against gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. it retains the good gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged paes.

TI  == susceptibility to levofloxacin of clinical isolates of bacteria from intensive care and haematology/oncology patients in switzerland: a multicentre study.
AB  == the objective of this study was to examine the susceptibility of clinical isolates to levofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone with extended activity against gram-positive bacteria, and other antibiotics in 12 swiss clinical microbiology laboratories using the nccls disc diffusion technique. isolates were prospectively collected from intensive care units (icus (59%), oncology wards (7%) and other units with haematology/oncology patients (34%) from june 1995 to march 1996. the levofloxacin breakpoints used were as recommended by the manufacturer. a total of 310 gram-positive and 580 gram-negative isolates from the respiratory tract (36%), skin/wounds (12%), blood (16%), urine (17%) and other sources (19%) were tested. the percentage of isolates susceptible to levofloxacin was 100% for enterococcus spp. (38 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (13), streptococcus pneumoniae (65), acinetobacter spp. (11), citrobacter diversus (6), citrobacter freundii (17), klebsiella oxytoca (39), morganella morganii (16), proteus mirabilis (20), proteus vulgaris (23), serratia spp. (19), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (10) and haemophilus influenzae (41). the percentage of isolates susceptible to levofloxacin for staphylococcus aureus (95  strains, including 2% mrsa) was 94%, coagulase-negative staphylococci (85) 65%, enterobacter spp. (75) 99%, escherichia coli (111) 97%, klebsiella pneumoniae (45) 98% and pseudomonas aeruginosa (124) 87%. in conclusion, levofloxacin is a new fluoroquinolone to which the most common clinical isolates in switzerland are susceptible. the susceptibility of enterococcus spp. and s. pneumoniae to levofloxacin was particularly remarkable. this compound appears to be a promising therapeutic alternative for the treatment of gram-positive infections.

TI  == cefetamet pivoxil: comparable evaluation with other orally available antibiotics  against selected species of respiratory pathogens.
AB  == cefetamet pivoxil, the prodrug ester of cefetamet, is a new third-generation cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of activity. the in vitro activity of cefetamet was superior to that of cefaclor, ceftibuten, amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, and amoxicillin alone when tested against 403 strains of freshly isolated upper and lower respiratory tract pathogens. cefetamet killed 100% haemophilus influenzae and h. parainfluenzae, including beta-lactamase-producing  strains, at < or = 0.25 mg/l, streptococcus pyogenes and s. pneumoniae at < or =  0.5 mg/l, s. agalactiae at < or = 0.1 mg/l, and streptococci at < or = 2.0 mg/l.  moreover, at < or = 4 mg/l (breaking point), cefetamet was also highly effective  against escherichia coli (94%), klebsiella pneumoniae (92%), k. oxytoca (91%) and, at 1 mg/l, against moraxella catarrhalis (90%), including beta-lactamase-producing strains. furthermore, time-killing analyses at 4 x mic demonstrated that cefetamet was bactericidal against beta-lactamase-producing h.  influenzae, m. catarrhalis, and k. pneumoniae within 6 h and s. pneumoniae within 4 h. hydrolysis studies confirmed cefetamet's stability to tem1 and shv1, the most common enterobacterial beta-lactamases.

TI  == [nodular pulmonary opacities caused by a severe suppurative bronchitis and bronchiectases].
AB  == history and clinical findings: a 67-year-old man with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) for many years and a heavy smoker was hospitalized because of increasing dyspnoea and moderately productive cough. his general condition was clearly impaired. he was markedly cyanotic, he had a barrel-shaped  chest, and there were wheezing rhonchi throughout the lung. body temperature was  37.8 degrees c. he had mild ankle oedema. the preliminary diagnosis was exacerbation of the copd with global respiratory failure. tests: there was severe hypoxaemia (po2 48 mm hg) with hypercapnia (pco2 46 mm hg). vital capacity was reduced to 1.81, one-second forced expiratory volume 0.91. chest radiograph revealed multiple nodular opacities, such as seen in bronchial carcinoma with metastases. but computed tomography showed fluid-filled bronchi. bronchoscopy demonstrated large amounts of dirty-white, sticky secretions as high up as the trachea, confirming the preliminary diagnosis. klebsiella oxytoca and haemophilus influenzae were cultured from the secretions. treatment and course: immediate administration of amoxycillin and clavulanic acid (2.2 g daily) quickly led to clinical improvement. chest x-ray was normalized after 10 days. but long-term oxygen treatment was instituted because of persisting resting hypoxaemia (po2 46  mm hg), after which he was discharged free of dyspnoea. conclusion: to clarify nodular pulmonary opacities in a chest radiograph computed tomography should be performed before bronchoscopy.

TI  == comparative evaluation of orally active antibiotics against community-acquired pathogens: a multi-center study in five mediterranean countries.
AB  == in 5 mediterranean countries 7902 pathogens, all isolated in 1992 and 1993 from community-acquired infections, were studied for susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin g, ampicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, amoxycillin + clavulanic acid (both 2:1 ratio), cefalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime,  cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. ten centers in italy, 4 centers in greece, 3 centers in spain, and 1 center in lebanon and saudi arabia contributed  to this study; all centers used performed standardized microtiter panels (sceptor, bbl, heidelberg, frg). the most frequently isolated pathogens were escherichia coli (n = 1267), proteus mirabilis (n = 843), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 771), enteric salmonella spp. (n = 629), enterobacter cloacae (n = 486), citrobacter freundii (n = 383), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 346), haemophilus influenzae (n = 298), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 294), streptococcus pneumoniae  (n = 246), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 243), and shigella spp. (n = 185). statistical analysis was performed for each of the above countries and for all pooled data available. the penicillin antibiotics were the most active compounds against the  gram-positive cocci, exceeding the mic90 values 2- to 8-fold over all cephalosporins. regarding the gram-negatives (above all klebsiella spp.) cefetamet was by far the most active compound (mic90 = 1 mg/l). regarding the percentage of resistant isolates, there were no striking discrepancies between the centers and countries involved in this study. there was, however, complete cross-resistance in penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae isolates (mic90 = 2 mg/l). by far the majority of the penicillin-resistant pneumococci showed additional resistance to doxycycline and erythromycin.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [antimicrobial activity of cefodizime against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == in order evaluate antimicrobial activities of cefodizime (cdzm), minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic's) of cdzm and other control drugs were determined against various clinical isolates, that were sent to our center from nation-wide  medical institutions or were isolated and identified in our laboratory from various specimens of infected patients. the followings are a summary of the results: 1. bacterial species with no or few strains resistant to cephems including cdzm included streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, citrobacter diversus, most of klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis. some strains of klebsiella oxytoca were resistant to cephems increases in beta-lactams resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and cephem resistant escherichia coli seemed likely. among citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii and providencia spp. belonging to a category of so-called "mildly toxic bacteria", high portions of the strains examined were resistant to cephems including cdzm and these strains were also resistant to new quinolones, thus they showed multiple drug resistance. 2. mic90's of cdzm against streptococcus spp., h. infleunzae, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, e. coli, klebsiella spp. and p. mirabilis, frequently found in daily treatment of infections, were less than < or = 0.025 to 1.56 micrograms/ml. this indicates that cdzm would be expected to have enough antibiotic activity in infections caused by above mentioned bacteria. however, cautions are needed in the treatment of infections by beta-lactam resistant s. pneumoniae, cephem resistant e. coli and cephem resistant k. oxytoca with cdzm. 3. among the above mentioned "mildly toxic bacteria", many multiple drug resistant strains exist. therefore, we evaluated an usefulness of concomitant use of cdzm with aminoglycosides in the treatment of infections by these bacteria, using other reports which indicates the usefulness in vitro and in vivo. 4. antibacterial activities of cdzm we observed in this study seem to indicate that  cdzm concentrations in infected areas are maintained at above mic levels for relatively long periods of time.

TI  == characterization of pilq, a new gene required for the biogenesis of type 4 fimbriae in pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == type 4 fimbriae are produced by a variety of pathogens, in which they appear to function in adhesion to epithelial cells, and in a form of surface translocation  called twitching motility. using transposon mutagenesis of pseudomonas aeruginosa, we have identified a new locus required for fimbrial assembly. this locus contains the gene pilq which encodes a 77 kda protein with an n-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence characteristic of secretory proteins. pilq mutants lack the spreading colony morphology characteristic of twitching motility, are devoid of fimbriae, and are resistant to the fimbrial-specific bacteriophage po4. the pilq gene was mapped to spel fragment 2, which is located at 0-5 minutes on the p. aeruginosa pao1 chromosome, and thus it is not closely linked to the previously characterized pila-d, pils,r or pilt genes. the pilq region also contains pona, arok and arob-like genes in an organization very similar to that of corresponding genes in escherichia coli and haemophilus influenzae. the predicted amino acid sequence of pilq shows homology to the puld protein of klebsiella oxytoca and related outer membrane proteins which have been found in association with diverse functions in other species including protein secretion,  dna uptake and assembly of filamentous phage. pilq had the highest overall homology to an outer membrane antigen from neisseria gonorrhoeae, encoded by omc, that may fulfil the same role in type 4 fimbrial assembly in this species.

TI  == molecular cloning and characterization of 13 out genes from erwinia carotovora subspecies carotovora: genes encoding members of a general secretion pathway (gsp) widespread in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the chemical mutagen ethylmethanesulphonate (ems) has been used to generate mutants of erwinia carotovora subspecies carotovora which are defective in the secretion of pectinases (pel) and cellulases (cel) but unaltered for protease (prt) secretion. such mutants, called out-, still synthesize pel and cel but these enzymes accumulate within the periplasm. cosmid clones carrying wild-type e. carotovora ssp. carotovora dna, identified by their ability to restore the out+ phenotype when transferred to some out- mutants, were classified into six complementation groups using cosmids and cosmid derivatives. analysis of the nucleotide sequence of a 12.7 kb dna fragment, encompassing complementing cosmid  inserts, revealed a coding capacity for 13 potential open reading frames (orfs),  and these were designated outc-outo. some of the out gene products were visualized using a t7 gene 10 expression system. the predicted out proteins are highly similar to components of extracellular enzyme secretion systems from a diverse range of eubacteria including erwinia chrysanthemi, klebsiella oxytoca, aeromonas hydrophila, pseudomonas aeruginosa and xanthomonas campestris. lower levels of similarity exist between ecc out proteins and components of macromolecular trafficking systems from bacillus subtilis, haemophilus influenzae, agrobacterium tumefaciens, yersinia pestis and a protein involved in  the morphogenesis of filamentous bacteriophages such as m13.

AB  == cefprozil is a newer oral cephalosporin with a spectrum of activity against organisms that include gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. a review of published data shows that cefprozil is active (susceptibility, less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml; moderate susceptibility, 16 micrograms/ml; resistance, greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml) against gram-positive species such as  streptococci, methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, and listeria monocytogenes;  it may have marginal activity against some enterococci. among the gram-negative species, cefprozil has activity against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis. for anaerobic species, cefprozil has activity against clostridial species, including clostridium difficile, peptostreptococci, and possibly bacteroides melaninogenicus and eubacterium. the  activity of cefprozil is generally greater than that of cephalexin and generally  similar to that of cefaclor. in these reports, cefprozil showed more in vitro activity than cephalexin and cefaclor against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, penicillin-resistant viridans streptococci, beta-lactamase-positive methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, and c. difficile, although the clinical significance of some of these differences has yet to be studied.

TI  == in vitro activity of cefquinome, a new cephalosporin, compared with other cephalosporin antibiotics.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cefquinome, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a c-3 bicyclic pyridinium group, was compared with ceftazidime, cefpirome, and cefepime. cefquinome inhibited members of the enterobacteriaceae at less than or  equal to 0.5 microgram/ml for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, citrobacter diversus, salmonella shigella, proteus mirabilis, morganella, and providencia. although most citrobacter freundii and enterobacter  cloacae were inhibited by less than 2 micrograms/ml, some strains resistant to ceftazidime were resistant, [minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) greater than  16 micrograms/ml]. serratia marcescens were inhibited by less than 1 microgram/ml and pseudomonas aeruginosa by 8 micrograms/ml similar to the activity of cefepime. the majority of haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited by less than 0.25 microgram/ml. most enterococci had cefquinome mics of 4-8 micrograms/ml. cefquinome was extremely active against group-a streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae with mics less than 0.12 microgram/ml. 90% of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus 90% were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml. overall, the in vitro activity of cefquinome was comparable with aminothiazolyl cephalosporins. it inhibited some enterobacter and citrobacter freundii resistant to ceftazidime as did cefpirome and cefepime. cefquinome was not destroyed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases tem-1, tem-2, shv-1, or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of klebsiella, branhamella, and pseudomonas, but  it was hydrolyzed by tem-3, tem-5, and tem-9. its activity was not adversely decreased in different medium or protein, and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) for most species except for enterobacter were within a dilution of mics.

TI  == ru 29 246, the active compound of the cephalosporin-prodrug-ester hr 916. i. antibacterial activity in vitro.
AB  == the aminothiazolyl-cephalosporin ru 29 246 is the active metabolite of the prodrug-pivaloyl-oxyethyl-ester hr 916. ru 29 246 in vitro activity includes a wide range of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens. against methicillin-sensitive staphylococci ru 29 246 (mic90 of 0.25 approximately 2 micrograms/ml) was clearly more active than cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, cefixime and ceftibuten, but slightly less active than cefdinir. ru 29 246 inhibited hemolytic streptococci of the serogroups a, b, c and g as well as penicillin-sensitive streptococcus pneumoniae at concentrations similar to cefdinir, cefpodoxime and cefuroxime (mic90 less than or equal to 0.13 micrograms/ml), but less than the other oral cephalosporins investigated (cefixime, cefaclor and ceftibuten). mic90s of ru 29 246 against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, salmonella spp., shigella spp.,  proteus mirabilis and haemophilus influenzae were less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. only ru 29 246 and cefdinir demonstrated moderate activity against acinetobacter baumannii (mic90 greater than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml). most strains of pseudomonas spp., serratia marcescens, enterobacter spp., hafnia alvei and bacteroides spp. were resistant to ru 29 246. ru 29 246 killed escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus at a rate of 99% to 99.9% at concentrations of two times mic. the ph value of the medium (range 5.5 to 8.5) and the inoculum size (range 10(5) to 10(7) cfu/ml) had no or only low influence on the antibacterial activity of ru 29 246. ru 29 246 is a broad spectrum cephalosporin including in its activity both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens and therefore--depending on the bioavailability of its prodrug--looks promising as to its therapeutic perspective.

TI  == clinical results of a multicenter study with sulbactam/ampicillin for the treatment of patients with lower respiratory and urinary tract infections.
AB  == a total of 124 patients with lower respiratory tract (44) or urinary tract infections (80) were enrolled in an open, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of sulbactam/ampicillin, administered at the dosage of  3 g/die by intramuscular route. pretreatment pathogens from patients with lower respiratory tract infections included: streptococcus alpha-haemolyticus in 8 cases, streptococcus beta-haemolyticus in 2 cases, staphylococcus albus in 7 cases, haemophilus influenzae in 7 cases, staphylococcus aureus in 6 cases, klebsiella oxytoca in 5 cases, staphylococcus epidermidis in 3 cases, streptococcus pneumoniae in 3 cases, escherichia coli in 2 cases; in one subject  (2.75%), no microorganisms were isolated. in vitro, 36 isolates (84%) were sensitive to sa and 7 (16%) were resistant. at the end of therapy, all the causative pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated. in patients with urinary tract infections, pretreatment pathogens were: e. coli in 40 cases, s. albus in 16 cases, proteus mirabilis in 8 cases, enterobacter agglomerans in 6 cases, proteus vulgaris in 3 cases, streptococcus faecalis in 3  cases, streptococcus liquefaciens in 2 cases, pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2 cases.  in vitro, 64 isolates (80%) were sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin and 16 (20%) were resistant. at the end of therapy, 63 out of the 64 pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated; in one case the therapy was interrupted due to adverse effect. clinical efficacy: in subjects with lower respiratory tract infections, sulbactam/ampicillin cured 32 patients (72.72%) and ameliorated the clinical status of 8 patients (18.18%); efficacy rate: 90.9%).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == microbiology of chronic sinusitis in children.
AB  == to better understand the factors involved in chronic sinusitis in childhood, we cultured the sinuses, middle meatus, and nasopharynx in 39 children requiring surgical intervention. sixty-nine percent of these patients had other medical problems, including asthma (49%) and immunologic compromise (18%). we cultured coagulase-negative staphylococcus in 18 patients, streptococcus viridans in 14 patients, normal flora in 10 patients, staphylococcus aureus in nine patients, group d streptococcus in five patients, corynebacterium in five patients, haemophilus influenzae in three patients, neisseria in three patients, and streptococcus pneumoniae, group a streptococcus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella oxytoca, propionibacterium acnes, actinomyces, and an anaerobic gram-negative bacillus in one patient each. cultures yielded no growth  in nine patients. a strong association between cultures of the middle meatus obtained ipsilaterally and cultures of the maxillary (83%) and ethmoid sinuses (80%) occurred. a poor correlation was found between cultures of the nasopharynx  and maxillary (45%) and ethmoid sinuses (49%). all seven patients who had both maxillary and ethmoid sinus cultures showed the same organisms in both sinuses. only 41% of organisms were found on both sides when procedures were performed bilaterally. cultures of the middle meatus appear to be sensitive and specific for organisms within sinuses. the presence of predominantly nonvirulent organisms in low titers suggests that additional factors other than bacterial overgrowth contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic sinusitis in children.

TI  == in vitro activity of a new cephalosporin me-1206 compared with other agents.
AB  == the in vitro activity of me-1206, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin that can be  orally absorbed when converted to an ester, was compared with that of other beta-lactams. me-1206 inhibited 50% of the enterobacteriaceae at 2 micrograms/ml, similar to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and cefixime. it did not inhibit, mic greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml, enterobacter species or citrobacter freundii resistant to cefotaxime and ceftazidime, and it was less active than cefotaxime and ceftazidime against serratia marcescens. haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and moraxella catarrhalis were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml of me-1206 inhibited hemolytic streptococci groups a, b, c, and g, mic90 0.06 micrograms/ml, but it did not inhibit enterococci. pseudomonas  aeruginosa and other pseudomonads were resistant to me-1206. mics and mbcs of me-1206 for susceptible species were within a dilution. me-1206 was not hydrolyzed by tem-1 or tem-2, but was hydrolyzed by tem-3 and tem-5. me-1206 was  hydrolyzed by beta-lactamases of morganella, proteus vulgaris, and k1 of klebsiella oxytoca, but minimally by the p99 beta-lactamase of enterobacter cloacae. me-1206 is comparable in in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability  to many of the current cephalosporins.

AB  == fifty-two patients with moderate or severe infections associated with internal medicine were treated with imipenem/cilastatin sodium (ipm/cs) and the efficacy and the safety of this drug were evaluated. there were 20 patients with pneumonia, 10 with acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections, 9  with sepsis, 2 with pyothorax, 3 with intraabdominal infection, 2 with urinary tract infection, 1 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with infective endocarditis, 4 with  fever of unknown origin. forty-four patients were evaluable for the efficacy. clinical efficacies were excellent in 12 patients, good in 26, fair in 3 and poor in 3. the overall clinical efficacy was 86.4%. the efficacy rate was 63.6% in patients previously treated and 93.9% in patients previously untreated with other antibiotics. bacteriologically, staphylococcus aureus (8 strains), streptococcus  pneumoniae (5), streptococcus pyogenes (1), other gram-positive coccus (1), klebsiella pneumoniae (8), haemophilus influenzae (4), pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), serratia marcescens (3), escherichia coli (3), branhamella catarrhalis (1),  citrobacter freundii (1), klebsiella oxytoca (1), enterobacter sp. (1), and peptostreptococcus sp. (1) were eradicated. p. aeruginosa (3) and acinetobacter sp. (1) decreased. s. aureus (1), s. epidermidis (1), p. aeruginosa (5), and s. marcescens (1) persisted or appeared. the eradication rate was 83.7%. six patients showed adverse reactions including general fatigue 1, epigastralgia 1, eruption 1, eosinophilia 1 and elevation of s-got 2. but all of the adverse reactions were mild or slight, and transient. these findings indicate that ipm/cs is a useful and safe drug against bacterial infections in internal medicine.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of gr69153, a new long-acting cephalosporin.
AB  == gr69153, a new parenteral cephalosporin, inhibited 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter diversus, shigellae, and salmonellae at less than 0.25 micrograms/ml (mic90). it had activity comparable to those of ceftazidime, cefpirome, cefepime, and e-1040. against cephalosporinase-producing enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, and serratia marcescens, mics ranged from 0.12 to greater than 32 micrograms/ml, and  cefpirome and cefepime were the most active agents against these species. pseudomonas aeruginosa was highly susceptible to gr69153, and for this organism the mic90 was less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, which was similar to the e-1040 mic90, but most pseudomonas cepacia and xanthomonas maltophilia isolates were resistant. gr69153 inhibited haemophilus influenzae and moraxella branhamella at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. for staphylococcus aureus gr69153 mics were similar to those of ceftazidime and e-1040. enterococci and listeriae were resistant to gr69153, but streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml. the activity of gr69153 was not affected by serum. gr69153 was not inactivated by the beta-lactamases of staphylococcus aureus, tem-1, tem-2, shv-1, and bro-1, but it was hydrolyzed by tem-3, tem-9, and morganellae. gr69153 had overall activity comparable to those of commercially available parenteral cephalosporins or those found in clinical investigations. it is more active against bacteroides than most available aminothiazolyl parenteral cephalosporins are. gr69153 is hydrolyzed by the new plasmid beta-lactamases, and thus, its primary value may be related to its pharmacological properties.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime, a new orally active methoxy-imino cephalosporin was evaluated in 470 recent isolates of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods from clinical specimens and compared to that of other orally active beta-lactam compounds. cefpodoxime was highly active against ampicillin-resistant enterobacteria producing the plasmid-mediated tem-1, tem-2 or oxa-1 enzymes, as was the case for the other newer compounds. however, it was  poorly active against cefuroxime-resistant (mic greater than or equal to 16 mg/l) e. coli isolates, thus resembling cefetamet and cefixime. it was inactive against isolates exhibiting a production of large amounts of class i beta-lactamase, as was the case with all other compounds studied. cefpodoxime was highly active against beta-hemolytic streptococci and against haemophilus influenzae, resembling the related agents. moreover, its activity against staphylococcus aureus was comparable to that of cefotaxime and exceeded that of cefetamet and cefixime. cefpodoxime and the other methoxyimino cephalosporins exhibited a poor  affinity to the plasmid-mediated tem-2 and oxa-1 enzymes. the hydrolysis of cefpodoxime by class i beta-lactamases was barely detectable, whereas it served as a moderate substrate for the enzyme from klebsiella oxytoca 3951. cefpodoxime, cefetamet and cefixime were slowly inactivated by the enzyme from proteus vulgaris 4917 (an enzyme with cefuroximase activity) and much poorer substrates than cefotaxime.

AB  == antibacterial activities of monobactam antibiotics (carumonam (crmn) and aztreonam (azt] against gram-negative bacilli isolated from inpatients in the latter half of 1987 were investigated using penicillin (pc: piperacillin (pipc],  cephems (ceps: ceftazidime (caz), cefotaxime (ctx), latamoxef (lmox), cefsulodin  (cfs], carbapenem (imipenem (ipm] and pyridonecarboxylic acids (norfloxacin (nflx) and ofloxacin (oflx] as reference antibiotics. a total of 400 strains of 13 species, i.e. escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and haemophilus influenzae, were used as test  strains. 1. crmn and azt, both monobactam antibiotics, were roughly comparable in their activities and no resistant strain to these antibiotics were found among isolates of e. coli, klebsiella spp., proteus spp., m. morganii, p. rettgeri or h. influenzae and few resistant strains were observed among isolates of s. marcescens. on the other hand, isolates of c. freundii, enterobacter spp. and p.  aeruginosa included rather numerous strains resistant to the monobactam antibiotics. among these cases, whereas r strains, i.e. resistant strains showing mics greater than or equal to 50 micrograms/ml, accounted for a large proportion  of strains resistant to pc and ceps, i strains, i.e. intermediately resistant strains showing mics between 12.5 and 25 micrograms/ml, accounted for a large proportion of strains resistant to the monobactam antibiotics. 2. strains resistant to pipc, a pc, were detected with high and more or less uniform frequencies over the entire spectrum of the isolates examined. 3. antibacterial activities of ceps varied against different bacterial species. while strains resistant to ctx, caz and lmox were commonly detected with high frequencies among isolates of c. freundii, enterobacter spp. and s. marcescens, large percentages of lmox-resistant strains of c. freundii and enterobacter spp. were of the i type. ctx-resistant strains were also found among isolates of p. vulgaris and m.  morganii. proportions of cep-resistant strains of p. aeruginosa were 28% for cfs  and 12% for caz. 4. no or few strains among the isolates of 13 species investigated were resistant to ipm, a carbapenem antibiotic, which showed the most stable antibacterial activity, but it was less active than monobactam antibiotics and ceps against klebsiella spp., p. mirabilis and h. influenzae.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == [clinical evaluation of s 6472 granule preparation (sustained-release cefaclor) in chronic bronchitis].
AB  == s 6472 granule preparation, a sustained-release cefaclor, was orally administered to 20 acutely exacerbated cases of chronic bronchitis at a daily dosage of 750 mg (titer) in 2 divided doses for a duration of 7-15 days and its clinical usefulness was evaluated. clinical efficacies were good in 17 cases and fair in 3 cases, with a rate of efficacy of 85.0%. organisms isolated from 13 patients were totalling 14 strains, i.e., 5 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 3 strains of branhamella catarrhalis, 2 strains of streptococcus sp., 2 strains of klebsiella  oxytoca, 1 strain of haemophilus influenzae and 1 strain of staphylococcus aureus. all these strains, except the strains of streptococcus sp., disappeared upon the administration of the drug. with regard to the safety, no side effects nor abnormal laboratory test values were encountered.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of cs-807, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  == cs-807 is a new oral prodrug of r-3746, a cephalosporin derivative, with potent in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the susceptibility of about 1,200 clinical isolates to r-3746 was determined by the agar dilution method. ninety percent or more of pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, indole-positive and indole-negative proteus spp., providencia rettgeri, and haemophilus influenzae were inhibited at  concentrations ranging less than or equal to 0.01 to 1.56 micrograms/ml. furthermore, at a concentration of 3.13 micrograms/ml, 50% or more of staphylococcus epidermidis, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii, and serratia marcescens strains were also inhibited. pseudomonas aeruginosa and xanthomonas maltophilia were resistant to r-3746. the activity of r-3746 was scarcely influenced by several growth conditions. r-3746 was highly resistant to  hydrolysis by beta-lactamases derived from various species of bacteria. killing-curve studies demonstrated bactericidal activity of r-3746 at concentrations above the mic. r-3746 showed high affinity for penicillin-binding  proteins 1, 3, and 4 of staphylococcus aureus and 1a, 1bs, and 3 of escherichia coli. systemic infections in mice caused by various pathogens, including beta-lactamase-producing strains, responded well to therapy with oral doses of cs-807.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new monobactam, b0-1165.
AB  == b0-1165 is a 1-carboxy-1-cyclopropoxyamino,4-fluoromethyl monobactam. it inhibited the majority of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter diversus, aeromonas hydrophila, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, yersinia enterocolitica, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and salmonella and shigella species at less than or equal to 0.125 microgram/ml. overall, its in vitro activity was similar to that of aztreonam, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime, with minor differences in the mics for individual isolates. enterobacter species and citrobacter freundii which were derepressed for beta-lactamase production and had higher mics of aztreonam and ceftazidime had mics that ranged from 4 to 32 micrograms/ml. b0-1165 had activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa similar to that of aztreonam but lower than that of ceftazidime and carumonam. pseudomonas maltophilia and other pseudomonas species were resistant or had mics of 32 micrograms/ml, as did acinetobacter species. b0-1165 did not inhibit streptococcal, staphylococcal, or anaerobic species, such as clostridium and bacteroides species. b0-1165 was not hydrolyzed to any appreciable extent by common plasmid- and chromosomally richmond-sykes type 1a-, 1c-, and 1d-mediated beta-lactamases. it inhibited the enterobacter cloacae p99 and inducible pseudomonas aeruginosa beta-lactamases. b0-1165 was a poor inducer of beta-lactamase, but exposing e. cloacae and c. freundii to b0-1165 selected for resistant isolates. overall, b0-1165 had in vitro properties similar to those of  other monobactams currently available or under investigation.

TI  == the anti-microbial activity, beta-lactamase stability, and disk diffusion susceptibility testing of carumonam (ro 17-2301, ama-1080), a new monobactam.
AB  == carumonam, a new monobactam, was found to have an anti-microbial spectrum similar to aztreonam. its spectrum includes enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, pathogenic neisseria species, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and some streptococci. staphylococcus species, enterococci, and many other nonenteric gram-negative bacilli were not inhibited. enterobacteriaceae resistant to cefoperazone (minimum inhibitory concentrations [mics] greater than or equal to 32 mg/l) were more likely inhibited by carumonam (52% at less than or equal to 8.0 mg/l) than aztreonam (39%) or ceftazidime (35%). dilution test methods on agar or in mueller-hinton broth produced similar results. carumonam minimum bactericidal concentrations were usually the same or one dilution above the mic. carumonam and aztreonam were very stable to most chromosomal (p99, k1, k14) and plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (tem, oxa, pse). the klebsiella oxytoca enzymes  hydrolyzed aztreonam at rates greater than or equal to fivefold higher than carumonam but at a rate less than 1% that of cephaloridine. the aztreonam mics for these klebsiella stains were greater than or equal to 32 mg/l, but the hydrolysis rates do not fully explain the high-grade resistance to aztreonam. in  vitro susceptibility tests with 30-micrograms carumonam disks were found to be very predictive. similar regression statistics were observed for aztreonam and cefotaxime. recommendations for carumonam susceptibility testing are susceptible  greater than or equal to 21 mm (less than or equal to 8.0 mg/l) and resistant less than or equal to 14 mm (greater than or equal to 32 mg/l). cross-resistance  analysis favors the independent testing of carumonam or aztreonam against gram-negative species other than enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of two oral cephalosporins, ceftetrame (ro 19-5247) and cefetamet (ro 15-8074).
AB  == ceftetrame (ro 19-5247) and cefetamet (ro 15-8074), two new orally administered aminothiazolyl imimomethoxy cephalosporins, inhibited hemolytic streptococci and  streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml but were less active against staphylococci than were cephalexin and cefaclor. they did not inhibit s. faecalis, s. faecium, listeria monocytogenes, corynebacterium jk species, or pseudomonas aeruginosa. haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, including ampicillin-resistant isolates,  were inhibited at less than 0.25 micrograms/ml. both agents inhibited escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, salmonella species, shigella species, citrobacter diversus, and aeromonas hydrophila resistant to ampicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, although many isolates of enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, and serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime were not inhibited by these agents. a marked inoculum effect was noted for enterobacteriaceae carrying the richmond-sykes type 1a chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases, but plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases did not hydrolyze the compounds. both drugs inhibited the chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of e. cloacae, p99.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (ama-1080), a new n-sulfonated monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic.
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (ama-1080), a synthetic sulfazecin derivative, were compared with those of aztreonam, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and cefsulodin. carumonam was highly active in vitro against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and haemophilus influenzae and weakly active against streptococcus pneumoniae, but it was not active against staphylococcus aureus. the mics of carumonam for 90% of 1,156 clinical enterobacteriaceae isolates were between 0.013 and 25 micrograms/ml, which were the lowest mics of the antibiotics tested. the mic of carumonam for 90% of klebsiella oxytoca was 0.2 micrograms/ml, whereas that of aztreonam was 50 micrograms/ml. the superiority of carumonam to aztreonam and the reference cephalosporins was also demonstrated by their activities against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. the mic of carumonam for 90% of p. aeruginosa was 12.5 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the mics of aztreonam and ceftazidime. carumonam showed a high affinity for the penicillin-binding protein 3 of gram-negative bacteria, but not for the penicillin-binding proteins of s. aureus and bacteroides fragilis. carumonam was  resistant to hydrolysis by 12 plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases and 7 chromosomal  beta-lactamases. it was more stable than aztreonam to hydrolysis by the beta-lactamase of k. oxytoca; this stability is related to the superiority of the in vitro and in vivo activities of carumonam to those of aztreonam against this species. in general, the protective activities (50% effective dose) of carumonam  and reference antibiotics in mice with experimental intraperitoneal infections correlated with the in vitro activities (mic); carumonam showed excellent protective activity against most aerobic gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  == blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (cfu) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. at intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (hs-glc). forty-six isolates including all those examined of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, s. faecalis, s. milleri, s. mitior, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, serratia sp., enterobacter cloacae, bacterioides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, candida albicans, c. krusei and torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by hs-glc. hs-glc failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus. haemophilus influenzae, corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of s. epidermidis. the growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. no significant difference was found between hs-glc analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. all the yeast isolates were detected by hs-glc after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by hs-glc analysis than by other methods.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of fr 17027, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == fr 17027, a new orally absorbed cephalosporin ester, inhibited group a and b streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.1 micrograms/ml, which is similar to the inhibition concentration of amoxicillin and cefaclor, and was more active than cephalexin. it was less active (mic, 25 micrograms/ml) against staphylococci than was cephalexin, and it did not inhibit  streptococcus faecalis or listeria monocytogenes. fr 17027 inhibited beta-lactamase-producing isolates of neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus influenzae, and branhamella catarrhalis at less than 0.1 micrograms/ml and was more active than cefaclor or cephalexin against these bacteria. fr 17027 inhibited escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella  oxytoca, providencia stuartii, providencia rettgeri, and citrobacter diversus at  less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, including isolated resistant to amoxicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor, but it was less active than ceftizoxime. some strains of enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter agglomerans, citrobacter freundii, and enterobacter aerogenes were resistant (mic, greater than 25 micrograms/ml). fr 17027 did not inhibit pseudomonas aeruginosa, other pseudomonas species, acinetobacter species, or bacteroides species. activity was  minimally affected by growth conditions. fr 17027 was not hydrolyzed by the common beta-lactamases present in many of the pathogens causing respiratory and urinary tract infections in outpatients.

TI  == clinical evaluation of mezlocillin in neonates.
AB  == single-dose pharmacokinetic studies were performed in 64 infants, ranging in age  from less than 1 day to 6 days, after intravenous infusion or intramuscular injection of approximately 75 mg/kg of mezlocillin. mean serum concentrations at  one hour were 107 micrograms/ml and 82.5 micrograms/ml for neonates less than or  equal to 1 day of age and greater than or equal to 6 days of age, respectively. the serum clearance ranged from 3.0 to 6.4 hours. based on data from the study, it is recommended that mezlocillin be administered to neonates with gram-negative bacterial infections in a single dose of 75 mg/kg, either as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes or as an intramuscular injection, every 12 hours during  the first week of life. mezlocillin alone or in conjunction with penicillin was used in treating 165 neonates with suspected sepsis. gram-negative organisms were recovered from 18 of the 27 neonates from whom pathogens were isolated. three of  these 18 strains, a klebsiella oxytoca, an acinetobacter anitratum, and a haemophilus influenzae, were resistant to mezlocillin in vitro. twenty-four of the 27 patients who satisfied criteria for evaluation achieved a bacteriological  and a clinical cure. cerebrospinal fluid permeation after multiple doses ranged from 18% to 45% of serum levels. no significant local or systemic side effects were seen. the results indicate that mezlocillin is an effective ureidopenicillin for the treatment of gram-negative bacterial infections.

TI  == evaluation of the four-hour micro-id technique for direct identification of oxidase-negative, gram-negative rods from blood cultures.
AB  == a 4-h micro-id technique for direct identification of oxidase-negative gram-negative rods from positive blood cultures was compared to subculture and species identification of single colonies by api 20e and micro-id, using standardized inocula. a total of 127 patients (220 positive cultures) were studied. isolates included 96 escherichia coli, 46 klebsiella pneumoniae, 7 klebsiella oxytoca, 8 enterobacter aerogenes, 17 enterobacter cloacae, 19 serratia marcescens, 2 serratia liquefaciens, 8 proteus mirabilis, 1 salmonella species, 1 morganella morganii, 6 haemophilus influenzae, 2 haemophilus parainfluenzae, 3 bacteroides fragilis, 3 acinetobacter calcoaceticus biotype anitratus, and 1 pseudomonas maltophilia. in 90% of the cultures, identification  by micro-id was identical to that obtained after subculture; if the 15 non-enterobacterial isolates were excluded, the corresponding figure was 96.6%. enterobacteria identified incorrectly by direct micro-id were three s. marcescens (two identified as s. liquefaciens, one as hafnia alvei), two s. liquefaciens (both identified as e. cloacae), and two k. pneumoniae (one identified as klebsiella ozaenae, the other as serratia rubidaea). none of the 15 non-enterobacterial cultures were correctly identified by micro-id (non-identifiable, or classified as providencia/yersinia/klebsiella species). although biochemical discrepancies between direct and final micro-id tests occurred in 41% of the enterobacterial cultures, this did not seriously interfere with identification. direct species identification of enterobacteriaceae from blood cultures by direct micro-id is accurate and easily performed and identified organisms within 4 h compared to at least 24 h by most other methods; the direct  micro-id technique would be rendered even more valuable by the additional capability of identifying non-enterobacterial gram-negative isolates.
