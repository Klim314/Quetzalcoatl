TI  == optimisation of the prevention and treatment of bacterial endocarditis.
AB  == this paper reviews currently established guidelines for the prevention and treatment of bacterial endocarditis. endocarditis remains a life-threatening disease with substantial morbidity and mortality. primary prevention of endocarditis, whenever possible, is therefore very important. in an individual with endocarditis, rapid diagnosis and effective treatment are essential to good  patient outcome. the guidelines discussed here are largely based on those issued  by the american heart association. while most cases of endocarditis are not attributable to an invasive procedure, certain procedures are associated with bacteraemia by organisms commonly associated with endocarditis, and antibacterial prophylaxis is recommended before such procedures. patient cardiac conditions are stratified into high, moderate and negligible risk categories based on potential  outcome if endocarditis develops. for oral, dental, respiratory tract, and oesophageal procedures (most often associated with viridans streptococci) the standard antibacterial regimen is oral amoxicillin. for gastrointestinal and genitourinary procedures (most often associated with enterococci), parenteral antibacterials are most often recommended. for high-risk patients, intramuscular  or intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin (or vancomycin and gentamicin in penicillin-allergic individuals) is recommended. for moderate risk patients, an option of oral amoxicillin or parenteral ampicillin is offered. treatment of bacterial endocarditis is guided by identification of the causative micro-organism. approximately 80% of cases of endocarditis are due to the gram-positive cocci: streptococci and staphylococci. other gram-positive organisms include enterococci (predominantly enterococcusfaecalis and e. faecium) and the hacek group of organisms (haemophilus parainfluenzae, h. aphrophilus, actinobacillus [haemophilus] actinomycetemcomitans, cardiobacterium hominis, eikenella corrodens, and kingella kingae). in general, for uncomplicated cases of endocarditis due to penicillin-susceptible viridans streptococci or streptococcus bovis 4 weeks of benzylpenicillin (or ceftriaxone) is the preferred regimen for most patients aged >65 years. a 2-week course of treatment can be used when gentamicin is added, in patients at low risk for adverse events caused by gentamicin therapy. when endocarditis is caused by strains of viridans streptococci or s. bovis relatively resistant to penicillin, or by enterococci, both benzylpenicillin and gentamicin are recommended. for staphylococcal endocarditis on native heart valves, nafcillin or oxacillin with or without gentamicin is the preferred regimen. in prosthetic valve staphylococcal endocarditis, nafcillin (or oxacillin) with rifampicin and gentamicin is recommended. for all of the above situations, vancomycin is recommended for the patient allergic to penicillin (or methicillin). finally, consideration of out-of-hospital therapy in selected patients is discussed.

TI  == in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500) against a large collection of infrequently isolated or tested species.
AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500, synercid) is a parenteral streptogramin combination antimicrobial that possesses a synergistic and often bactericidal action against many grampositive species. in this study, a collection of 1270 uncommonly isolated or tested strains were evaluated for susceptibility to quinupristin/dalfopristin using agar dilution minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) methods described in the national committe for clinical laboratory standards. the greatest antimicrobial activity observed for quinupristin/dalfopristin was against staphylococci, streptococci, the pathogenic neisseria, legionella spp., lactobacillus spp., and peptostreptococcus spp. (mic90 range, 0.5-2 micrograms/ml). marginal activity (mic90s, 4 to 8 micrograms/ml) was identified for the rarer enterococci, leuconostoc spp., pediococcus spp., and streptococcus bovis. against haemophilus parainfluenzae, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, fusobacterium spp., and prevotella spp., the streptogramin was inactive. although no susceptible breakpoint has been approved  for quinupristin/dalfopristin, three possible breakpoints (< or = 1, < or = 2, or < or = 4 micrograms/ml) were evaluated. acceptance of the lower breakpoints (< or = 1 or < or = 2 micrograms/ml) would limit quinupristin/dalfopristin use to staphylococci, streptococci, gonococci, meningococci, and legionella spp. these results markedly expand the understanding of the usable spectrum of quinupristin/dalfopristin.
