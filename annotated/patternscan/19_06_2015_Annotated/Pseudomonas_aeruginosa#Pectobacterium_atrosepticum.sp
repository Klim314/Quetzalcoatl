TI  == deciphering the dual effect of lipopolysaccharides from plant pathogenic pectobacterium.
AB  == lipopolysaccharides (lps) are a component of the outer cell surface of almost all gram-negative bacteria and play an essential role for bacterial growth and survival. lipopolysaccharides represent typical microbe-associated molecular pattern (mamp) molecules and have been reported to induce defense-related responses, including the expression of defense genes and the suppression of the hypersensitive response in plants. however, depending on their origin and the challenged plant, lps were shown to have complex and different roles. in this study we showed that lps from plant pathogens pectobacterium atrosepticum and pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum induce common and different responses in a. thaliana cells when compared to those induced by lps from non-phytopathogens escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. among common responses to both types of lps are the transcription of defense genes and their ability to limit of cell death induced by pectobacterium carotovorum subsp carotovorum. however, the differential kinetics and amplitude in reactive oxygen  species (ros) generation seemed to regulate defense gene transcription and be determinant to induce programmed cell death in response to lps from the plant pathogenic pectobacterium. these data suggest that different signaling pathways could be activated by lps in a. thaliana cells.

TI  == a type vi secretion system is involved in pseudomonas fluorescens bacterial competition.
AB  == protein secretion systems are crucial mediators of bacterial interactions with other organisms. among them, the type vi secretion system (t6ss) is widespread in gram-negative bacteria and appears to inject toxins into competitor bacteria and/or eukaryotic cells. major human pathogens, such as vibrio cholerae, burkholderia and pseudomonas aeruginosa, express t6sss. bacteria prevent self-intoxication by their own t6ss toxins by producing immunity proteins, which  interact with the cognate toxins. we describe here an environmental p. fluorescens strain, mfe01, displaying an uncommon oversecretion of hcp (hemolysin-coregulated protein) and vgrg (valine-glycine repeat protein g) into the culture medium. these proteins are characteristic components of a functional  t6ss. the aim of this study was to attribute a role to this energy-consuming overexpression of the t6ss. the genome of mfe01 contains at least two hcp genes (hcp1 and hcp2), suggesting that there may be two putative t6ss clusters. phenotypic studies have shown that mfe01 is avirulent against various eukaryotic  cell models (amebas, plant or animal cell models), but has antibacterial activity against a wide range of competitor bacteria, including rhizobacteria and clinical bacteria. depending on the prey cell, mutagenesis of the hcp2 gene in mfe01 abolishes or reduces this antibacterial killing activity. moreover, the introduction of t6ss immunity proteins from s. marcescens, which is not killed by mfe01, protects e. coli against mfe01 killing. these findings suggest that the protein encoded by hcp2 is involved in the killing activity of mfe01 mediated by  effectors of the t6ss targeting the peptidoglycan of gram-negative bacteria. our  results indicate that mfe01 can protect potato tubers against pectobacterium atrosepticum, which causes tuber soft rot. pseudomonas fluorescens is often described as a major pgpr (plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium), and our results suggest that there may be a connection between the t6ss and the pgpr properties of this bacterium.

TI  == regulation of type vi secretion gene clusters by sigma54 and cognate enhancer binding proteins.
AB  == type vi secretion systems (t6ss) are bacteriophage-derived macromolecular machines responsible for the release of at least two proteins in the milieu, which are thought to form an extracellular appendage. although several t6ss have  been shown to be involved in the virulence of animal and plant pathogens, clusters encoding these machines are found in the genomes of most species of gram-negative bacteria, including soil, marine, and environmental isolates. t6ss  have been associated with several phenotypes, ranging from virulence to biofilm formation or stress sensing. their various environmental niches and large diversity of functions are correlated with their broad variety of regulatory mechanisms. using a bioinformatic approach, we identified several clusters, including those of vibrio cholerae, aeromonas hydrophila, pectobacterium atrosepticum, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, and a marinomonas sp., which possess typical -24/-12 sequences, recognized by the alternate sigma factor sigma 54 (sigma(54) or sigma(n)). sigma(54), which directs the rna polymerase to these promoters, requires the action of a bacterial enhancer binding protein (bebp), which binds to cis-acting upstream activating sequences. putative bebps are encoded within the t6ss gene clusters possessing sigma(54) boxes. using in vitro binding experiments and in vivo reporter fusion assays, we showed that the expression of these clusters is dependent on both sigma(54) and bebps.

TI  == lines of evidence for horizontal gene transfer of a phenazine producing operon into multiple bacterial species.
AB  == phenazines are secondary metabolites with broad-spectrum antibiotic activity against bacteria, fungi, and eukaryotes. in pseudomonad species, a conserved seven-gene phenazine operon (phzabcdefg) is required for the conversion of chorismic acid to the broad-spectrum antibiotic phenazine-1-carboxylate. previous analyses of genes involved in phenazine production from nonpseudomonad species uncovered a high degree of sequence similarity to pseudomonad homologues. the analyses undertaken in this study wished to eluciadate the evolutionary history of genes involved in the production of phenazines. furthermore, i wanted to determine if the phenazine operon has been transferred through horizontal gene transfer. analyses of gc content, codon usage patterns, frequency of 3:1 dinucleotides, sequence similarities, and phylogenetic reconstructions were undertaken to map the evolutionary history of phenazine genes from multiple bacterial species. patchy phyletic distribution, high sequence similarities, and  phylogenetic evidence infer that pseudomonad, streptomyces cinnamonensis, pantoea agglomerans, burkholderia cepacia, pectobacterium atrosepticum, brevibacterium linens, and mycobacterium abscessus species all contain a phenazine operon which  has most likely been transferred among these species through horizontal gene transfer. the acquisition of an antibiotic-associated operon is significant, as it may increase the relative fitness of the recipient species.
