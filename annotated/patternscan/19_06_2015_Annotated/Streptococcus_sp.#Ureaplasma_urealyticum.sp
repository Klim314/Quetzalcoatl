TI  == bacterial infections of the lower genital tract in fertile and infertile women from the southeastern poland.
AB  == objectives: the objective of the study was to investigate the detection rates of  chlamydia trachomatis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, mycoplasma genitalium, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, gardnerella vaginalis, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae and enterococcus faecalis, showing no clinical signs of  an ongoing, acute inflammatory state of the vagina and/or the cenrvix, in fertile and infertile women. material and methods: the study encompassed 161 women, including 101 women treated for infertility and 60 fertile women who had already  given birth to healthy children. the material for the presence of c. trachomatis, n. gonorrhoeae, m. genitalium, m. hominis and u. urealyticum was collected from the cervical canal and analyzed by pcr. furthermore, bd probetec et system was used to detect c. trachomatis infection. vaginal swabs were collected for classification of bacterial vaginosis and aerobic vaginitis and assessed according to the nugent score, as well as by traditional culture methods. results: u. urealyticum was identified in 9% of the infertile women and in 8% of  controls. presence of m. hominis was demonstrated only in the former (4%) and c.  trachomatis only in latter (3%). n. gonorrhoeae and m. genitalium were not found  in any of the examined women. the frequency of aerobic vaginitis in both groups was estimated at 12%. there were 7% bacterial vaginosis cases in the study group, and none in the control group (p=0.0096). conclusions: despite having no symptoms of an ongoing acute inflammation of the reproductive tract, many women may experience permanent or periodic shifts of equilibrium of the vaginal and/or cervical microflora. bv develops more frequently in infertile patients when compared to the fertile women.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance of abnormal vaginal discharges microorganisms in ouagadougou, burkina faso.
AB  == objective: to assess the prevalence of bacterial strains and fungal strains infecting the vaginal tract and test their sensitivity to antibiotics in women attending saint camille medical centre in ouagadougou. methods: from january 2008 to december 2009, a total of 2 000 vaginal swabs were cultivated for bacterial and fungal identification and isolation. furthermore, bacterial strains were tested for their susceptibility to several antibiotics used in routine in the centre. results: the results revealed that microbial isolation and identification was attempted for 1 536/2 000 sample, a positivity rate of 76.80%. candida albicans (48.76%), followed by escherichia coli (16.67%), streptococcus agalactiae (8.14%) and staphylococcus aureus (7.55%) were the major agents of genital tract infections in patients. mycoplasma hominis and ureaplasma urealyticum combined accounted for less than 7%. trichomonas vaginalis was identified in 1.04% cases. the antimicrobial tests revealed that the microorganisms developed resistance to several antibiotics including beta lactams. however, antibiotics such as cefamenzol, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin were still active on these bacteria. conclusions: the results reveal that many sexually active women are infected by one or more microbial pathogens, probably because of the lack of hygiene or the adoption of some risky behaviors, such as not using condoms or having multiple sexual partners. efforts should be made to address these points in the country.

TI  == chronic scrotal pain syndrome (csps): the widespread use of antibiotics is not justified.
AB  == data supporting the widespread use of antibiotics in patients with chronic scrotal pain syndrome (csps) are not available. therefore, the aim of this study  was to investigate the presence of bacteria in the genitourinary tract in patients presenting with csps. from july 2005 to july 2007 we prospectively enrolled patients presenting with csps in our outpatient clinic. the evaluation consisted of a detailed patient's history, physical examination and ultrasound examination of the scrotum. a blood and urinalysis, a meares-stamey four-glass test for bacterial cultures and pcr testing for chlamydia trachomatis, ureaplasma urealyticum, mycoplasma hominis and neisseria gonorrhoeae as well as a semen culture were performed. we assessed the symptom severity with the chronic epididymitis symptom index (cesi) score according to nickel et al. (j urol 2002,  167:1701; based on the nih-cpsi). a total of 55 eligible men (median age 34 years) with csps were enrolled in the study. the median cesi score was 17 (range  4-26). the majority of patients (n = 39; 71%) were seen by a general practitioner or an urologist before. of these, 25 patients (64%) were treated with antibiotics and 26 (67%) with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, respectively. a significant bacterial colony count in at least one specimen was detected in 21 of 55 patients (38%). the predominantly detected microorganisms were an alpha-haemolytic streptococcus (11 patients) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (10 patients). thus, only in 12 of 55 (22%) patients isolated bacteria were considered to be of clinical relevance. no factor or condition predictive for a bacterial aetiology for csps could be identified. in our microbiological assessment of patients presenting with csps we found no evidence for the widely held belief that csps is predominantly the result of a chronic bacterial infection. we therefore conclude that the widespread use of antibiotic agents in  the treatment of patients with csps is not justified.

TI  == [microbiologic basis of diagnosis and treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease].
AB  == pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) is caused by a large spectrum of micro-organisms. however, the microbiological cause is unknown in approximately half of cases according to varying series. in the context of sexually transmitted disease (std), the most frequently identified microorganisms causing pid are neisseria gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis and mycoplasma genitalium. in such cases, bacterial vaginosis and trichomonas vaginalis are frequently associated. in case of complicated pid or when pid is the consequence of delivery, abortion,  intra-uterine procedure, bacteria that come from vaginal carriage may be encountered: enterobacteriacae, staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., anaerobes. mycopslama hominis as well as ureaplasma urealyticum may also be found in this context. the microbiological diagnosis may be performed on samples of vaginal liquid, endocervix or, when available, surgical specimens. the microbiological diagnostic procedures that are used to identify these microrgansims are reviewed. vaginal sampling may help to identify n. gonorrhoeae, c. trachomatis and m. genitalium using nucleic acid amplification tests (naat), and is also of interest because of the epidemiological association of pid to bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis. samples from the endocervix, and if available, from endometrial biopsy surgical procedures, should be processed to detect n. gonorrhoeae, c. trachomatis and m. genitalium using naat, and to search for the presence of neisseria gonorrhoeae (antibiogram should be performed), facultative anaerobes, anaerobes and capnophilic bacteria. the antibiotic treatment should at least cover n. gonorrhoeae, c. trachomatis and m. genitalium, and for most of the authors, anaerobes. in case, microbiological studies demonstrate the role of other bacteria (e.g., enterobacteriacae), theses should be treated according to the results of antibiogram.

TI  == simultaneous direct identification of genital microorganisms in voided urine using multiplex pcr-based reverse line blot assays.
AB  == our aim was to develop and evaluate sensitive methods that would allow simultaneous direct identification of multiple potential pathogens in clinical specimens for diagnosis and epidemiological studies, using a multiplex pcr-based  reverse line blot assay. we have previously developed assays suitable for detection of bacterial respiratory and systemic pathogens. in this chapter we describe, in detail, a method developed to identify 14 genital microorganisms, for use in epidemiological studies of genital infection or colonization, using first voided urine specimens. the 14 urogenital pathogens or putative pathogens studied were trichomonas vaginalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis, chlamydia trachomatis, ureaplasma parvum, u. urealyticum, mycoplasma hominis, m. genitalium, gardnerella vaginalis, haemophilus influenzae, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, and adenovirus. two species-specific primer pairs and probes were designed for each target. the method was validated using a reference strain or a well-characterized clinical isolate of each target organism. in a clinical study among men attending sexual health clinics in sydney, we used the assay to compare rates of detection of the  14 organisms in men with urethritis with those in asymptomatic controls and found the method to be sensitive, specific, convenient, and relatively inexpensive.

TI  == bacterial modulation of human fetal membrane toll-like receptor expression.
AB  == problem: preterm premature rupture of fetal membranes (pprom) occurs in 30-40% of spontaneous preterm births (ptb) and is associated with intra-amniotic infection  and inflammation. the membranes may sense and respond to microbes via toll-like receptors (tlrs); however, little is known about their expression and regulation  in this tissue. the objective of this study was to evaluate the expression of tlrs 1-10 in fetal membranes after exposure to pathogens associated with intra-amniotic infection and ptb. method of study: normal human term fetal membrane explants were exposed to various bacteria. after 24 hrs, rna was extracted and quantitative rt-pcr performed for tlrs1-10. results: treatment of fetal membranes with mycoplasma hominis increased expression of tlr4, tlr6, and tlr8 mrna. ureaplasma parvum upregulated tlr8 mrna, and porphyromonas gingivalis  significantly increased fetal membrane tlr7 expression. in contrast, treatment with gram-negative escherichia coli (and its cell wall component lipopolysaccharide) downregulated tlr10 mrna. no effect was detected for ureaplasma urealyticum, gardnerella vaginalis, or group b streptococcus. conclusion: these findings demonstrate that different types of bacteria have distinct effects on fetal membrane tlr expression patterns. moreover, these findings highlight the disparity of fetal membrane responses to infection and thus suggest heterogeneity in the mechanisms by which infection-associated pregnancy complications, such as pprom and ptb, arise.

TI  == the prevalence of vaginal microorganisms in pregnant women with preterm labor and preterm birth.
AB  == background: to investigate the risk factors for vaginal infections and antimicrobial susceptibilities of vaginal microorganisms among women who experienced preterm birth (ptb), we compared the prevalence of vaginal microorganisms between women who experienced preterm labor (ptl) without preterm  delivery and spontaneous ptb. methods: vaginal swab specimens from 126 pregnant women who experienced ptl were tested for group b streptococcus (gbs), mycoplasma hominis, mycoplasma genitalium, ureaplasma urealyticum, chlamydia trachomatis, trichomonas vaginalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, treponema pallidum, herpes simplex  virus (hsv) i and ii, and bacterial vaginosis. a control group of 91 pregnant women was tested for gbs. antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed for gbs, m. hominis, and u. urealyticum. results: the overall detection rates for each microorganism were: u. urealyticum, 62.7%; m. hominis, 12.7%; gbs, 7.9%; c.  trachomatis, 2.4%; and hsv type ii, 0.8%. the colonization rate of gbs in control group was 17.6%. the prevalence of gbs, m. hominis, and u. urealyticum in ptl without preterm delivery and spontaneous ptb were 3.8% and 8.7% (relative risk [rr], 2.26), 3.8% and 17.3% (rr, 4.52), and 53.8% and 60.9% (rr, 1.13), respectively, showing no significant difference between the 2 groups. the detection rate of m. hominis by pcr was higher than that by culture method (11.1% vs. 4.0%, p=0.010). the detection rates of u. urealyticum by pcr and culture method were 16.7% and 57.1%, respectively. conclusions: there was no significant  difference in the prevalence of gbs, m. hominis, and u. urealyticum between the spontaneous ptb and ptl without preterm delivery groups.

TI  == [possible role of enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis in the etiology of infectious vaginitis].
AB  == vaginitis is a common gynecologic disorder. it is due to several causes, some even unknown. bacteroides fragilis is the most important anaerobe in clinical bacteriology, some strains of this group are notable for being enterotoxigenic and they have been associated with intestinal and extraintestinal syndromes. they have recently been isolated from patients with vaginitis. the purpose of this study was to investigate a possible association of enterotoxigenic b. fragilis with infectious vaginitis. 265 samples of vaginal exudate were processed, 202 from symptomatic patients and 63 healthy women. the identification of the microorganisms was carried out by conventional methods. in 31.2% of symptomatic patients were identified: gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus, candida albicans, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum and streptococcus agalactiae. b. fragilis was identified in 27 symptomatic patients and 5 healthy women. these strains were cultivated in liquid medium and incubated during 48 h at 36 degrees  c in anaerobe chambers. supernatant activity was assayed in ht-29 cells. eighteen b. fragilis strains isolated from symptomatic patients were enterotoxigenic, because induced alterations in target cell morphology. it was not identified in healthy women (p < 0.05). 77.7% of enterotoxigenic b. fragilis strains were not associated with other specific pathogens. this fact suggests that enterotoxigenic b. fragilis could be a cause for vaginitis. the effect of enterotoxin on e-cadherin of vaginal epithelium could facilitate invasion and its possible pathogenic role in the vagina. this is the first report that associates enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis as a possible cause of infectious vaginitis.

TI  == microbiological findings in endometrial specimen: our experience.
AB  == purpose: collection of an endometrial specimen for investigating infectious agents in the endometrial cavity is an invasive technique that is at times difficult and painful. in order to avoid the need for endometrial sampling in the cases of suspected or evident endometrial pathology, the aim of this study is to  investigate the reliability of cervical cultures for detecting infectious agents  present at the endometrial level, comparing the results between cervical cultures and endometrial cultures in women with clinical signs of endometrial inflammation. methods: in a prospective diagnostic study, in the period from january 2009 to october 2010, we enrolled 404 women referred to the department of obstetrics and gynecology for diagnostic hysteroscopy. all the patients underwent cervical and endometrial sampling. cultures for common bacteria, neisseria gonorrhoeae, yeast, and ureaplasma urealyticum were performed. results: the most  frequent infectious agents detected at the endometrial level were common bacteria, which accounted for 69% of all cases. in particular, streptococci were  found in 27% of cases, and bacteria from intestinal flora (enterococcus faecalis  and escherichia coli) was recovered in 31% of cases. u. urealyticum was detected  in 10% and mycoplasma in only one patient (0.2% of cases). no cases of n. gonorrhoeae were found. conclusions: cervical culture has a low concordance with  endometrial culture. in fact in only 33% of cases was the microorganism found in  the cervix the same as that found in the endometrium. these results infer that an endometrial culture is a useful investigative tool for determining the microorganisms in endometrial pathology.

TI  == hiv-infected women of burkina faso: a "reservoir" of mycoplasma infection.
AB  == introduction: the objective of this work was to assess the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis (bv) and genital mycoplasma colonization in 251 hiv-positive  compared to 200 hiv-negative women at the maternal and child health (mch) service of saint camille medical center ouagadougou (burkina faso). methodology: after revealing the cervix with a speculum, we collected swabs of vaginal discharge for the detection of pathogenic bacteria. results: among hiv-positive and hiv-negative women, we identified respectively: mycoplasma hominis (16.7% versus  5.5%); ureaplasma urealyticum (16.3% versus 0.0%); co-infection m. hominis with u. urealyticum (13.14% versus 0.0%); candida albicans (21.11% versus 41.5%); e. coli (9.96% versus 4.0%); and the presence of abundant vaginal discharge (27.5% versus 5.0%) respectively. the nugent's score, utilized for the diagnosis of bv,  was significantly higher in hiv-positive women (p < 0.001) associated with poor vaginal hygiene practices (p < 0.01) and no use of condoms (p < 0.01). enterobacter, klebsiella pneumonia, klebsiella oxitocica, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, trichomonas vaginalis, and gardnerella vaginalis were also isolated, but in a low prevalence  ranging from 0% to 5%. conclusion: these results demonstrate that the hiv-positive women of burkina faso are frequently affected by bv and represent a  reservoir for mycoplasma infection. since these germs can lead to sterility and premature delivery, it is important to develop a policy of screening.

TI  == the prevalence of urogenital micro-organisms detected by a multiplex pcr-reverse  line blot assay in women attending three sexual health clinics in sydney, australia.
AB  == this study used a previously described multiplex pcr-based reverse line blot (mpcr/rlb) assay to assess the prevalence and distribution of 14 urogenital pathogens or putative pathogens, namely neisseria gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis, mycoplasma genitalium, mycoplasma hominis, trichomonas vaginalis, gardnerella vaginalis, ureaplasma parvum, ureaplasma urealyticum, neisseria meningitidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, and human adenovirus. first-voided urine specimens and endocervical and self-collected vaginal swabs from each of 216 women attending three sexual health clinics in sydney, australia, were tested and the results were compared with those of reference methods for each organism. one hundred and  sixty-eight women (77.7 %) had at least one and 105 (48.6 %) had more than one target organism, most commonly g. vaginalis and ureaplasma spp. the prevalence of each of the four known sexually transmissible pathogens was <5 %. of the 216 women, 111 (51.4 %) reported at least one symptom consistent with genital or urethral infection, including discharge, pain or discomfort. only g. vaginalis was detected more frequently in women with symptoms (p = 0.05). the specificity of the mpcr/rlb assay compared with that of the reference methods for each organism and for all specimen types was 100 %. the mean sensitivities of the mpcr/rlb assay compared with those of the reference methods for self-collected vaginal swabs, cervical swabs and first-voided urine specimens for all organisms  were 99.3, 98.1 and 84.6 %, respectively; however, these differences were not significant. there were no differences in sensitivities between specimen types for c. trachomatis, n. gonorrhoeae, t. vaginalis and h. influenzae, although all  were found infrequently. overall, the mpcr/rlb platform was found to be an accurate testing platform in a sexual health clinic setting.

TI  == [association of human papillomavirus infection with other microbial pathogens in  gynecology].
AB  == objective: to investigate correlation between screening assay of human papillomavirus (hpv) and microbial pathogens in gynecology. methods: cervical samples were collected to search for hpv, bacteria and yeast infections in gynecologic outpatients. hpv typing was carried out by pcr and sequencing on cervical brush specimens. chlamydia trachomatis was identified by strand displacement amplification (sda) and the other microorganisms were detected by conventional methods. all data were analyzed to investigate the correlation among them. results: in this cross-sectional study, among 857 enrolled outpatients, there were 266 cases with positive hpv dna, and the rate of infection was 31.0% (266/857). hpv genotype showed that thirty-five different hpv types were identified, of which hpv16 was the most prevalent (14.5%, 38/262), followed by hpv58 (9.2%, 24/262), hpv53 (8.0%, 21/262) and hpv42 (6.1%, 16/262); while other  genotypes were present in less than 5% of hpv positive women. according to the reclassification, the aggregated percentage (high-risk and probably high-risk) of detected hpv was 58.8% (154/262), 27.9% (73/262) for low-risk and 13.4% (35/262)  for unknown-risk hpv types. among hpv positive women, cervical brush specimens results showed that more than 60% cases with normal cytology, 3.8% (10/266) with  high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (hsil), 29.7% (79/266) with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (lsil) and 3.0% (8/266) with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ascus), respectively. statistical analyses revealed there was a significant association between the infected hpv and chlamydia trachomatis or ureaplasma urealyticum (> 10,000 ccu/ml; all p < 0.01),  while no correlation was found between hpv infection and bacterial vaginosis, streptococcus agalactiae, candida, trichomonas vaginalis or ureaplasma urealyticum (</= 10 000 ccu/ml; all p > 0.05). among the cases with bacterial vaginosis, the positive rate of hpv infected was 42.6%. chlamydia trachomatis was one of the high-risk factors for the infection of hpv (or = 2.82, 95% ci: 1.74 -  4.57). mycoplasma hominis was isolated only in 2 cases, no patient was infected with neisseria gonorrhoeae. conclusions: although bacterial vaginosis was not significantly associated with hpv, it was more common among the hpv positive women. there is the significant association between hpv and chlamydia trachomatis or ureaplasma urealyticum which may be increase the infection of hpv. these data  suggest that it may be important to screen for the simultaneous presence of different microorganisms which may have synergistic pathological effects.

TI  == detection of sexually transmitted infection and human papillomavirus in negative  cytology by multiplex-pcr.
AB  == background: the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of human papillomavirus (hpv) and 15 species that cause sexually transmitted infections (stis) in negative cytology. in addition, we compared the diagnostic performance  of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with widely available techniques used to detect hpv. methods: we recruited 235 women of reproductive age who had negative cytology findings in a liquid-based cervical smear. stis were identified by multiplex pcr, and hpv genotypes by multiplex pcr, hybrid capture 2, and dna microaray; discordant results were analyzed by direct sequencing. results: approximately 96.6% of patients with negative cytology results were positive for  pathogens that cause stis. the pathogens most frequently detected were gardnerella vaginalis, ureaplasma urealyticum. the incidence of hpv in negative cytology was 23.3%. low-risk hpv infection was significantly correlated with chalmaydia trachomatis, and high-risk hpv infection was significantly correlated  with group beta streptococcus. the analytical sensitivities of the multiplex pcr  and dna microarray were higher than 80%, and the analytical specificity was nearly 100% for all tests. conclusions: multiplex pcr yielded results that most of patients with negative cytology were positive for pathogens that cause stis, and were more similar to that of dna microarray, than that of hybrid capture 2 in terms of analytical sensitivity and prediction value of hpv infection.

TI  == interaction between pathogenic bacteria and intrauterine leukocytes triggers alternative molecular signaling cascades leading to labor in women.
AB  == increased risk of preterm labor has been linked to cervicovaginal infection with  ureaplasma urealyticum and group b streptococci. although various experimental models have been developed to study the role of amniochorion infection in preterm labor, they typically exclude the initial interaction between intrauterine leukocytes (recruited from decidual vessels into the avascular fetal membranes) and infecting bacteria. in this work, we ascertained whether inflammatory molecules secreted by bacterium-activated intrauterine leukocytes stimulate the amniochorion production of mediators involved in human labor. using a two-step process beginning with placental circulating leukocytes as a proxy for intrauterine leukocytes, we found that coincubation of amniochorion explants with plasma from placental whole blood preincubated with group b streptococci resulted in a significant increase in tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (mmp-9) levels in tissue. extensive changes in the connective tissue arrangement and a decrease in collagen content demonstrated the degradation of the extracellular matrix following this treatment. in contrast, plasma from blood preconditioned with u. urealyticum induced a highly significant secretion of interleukin-1beta (il-1beta) and prostaglandin e(2) (pge(2)) by the  amniochorion without changes in the extracellular matrix organization or content. these data demonstrate that group b streptococci induce degradation of the amniochorion as a result of mmp-9 production, probably via tnf-alpha, whereas u.  urealyticum stimulates the secretion of pge(2), probably via il-1beta, potentially stimulating myometrial contraction. our study provides novel evidence that the immunological cells circulating within the uterine microenvironment respond differentially to an infectious agent, triggering alternative molecular signaling pathways leading to human labor.

TI  == gardnerella, trichomonas vaginalis, candida, chlamydia trachomatis, mycoplasma hominis and ureaplasma urealyticum in the genital discharge of symptomatic fertile and asymptomatic infertile women.
AB  == this study aimed to establish the different prevalence of the microorganisms investigated in the two groups considered: fertile women with symptoms and asymptomatic women with infertility problems. the data from women (n= 952) investigated for two years for quality of genital discharge and the presence of gardnerella vaginalis, trichomonas vaginalis, candida species, streptococcus agalactiae, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyiticum and chlamydia trachomatis were retrospectively analyzed. in the population of fertile women with symptoms the microrganisms most frequently involved are gardnerella vaginalis (26.6%), candida species (12.1%) and streptococcus agalactiae (9.2%). the genital discharges of asymptomatic women with infertility problems are characterized by a prevalence of gardnerella vaginalis (19.7%), enterobacteriaceae or enterococci (12.1%) and streptococcus agalactiae (8.6%). the reduction of vaginal lactobacilli flora and the presence of an elevated number of polymorphonucleates  in the vaginal discharge are important parameters to consider for the evaluation  of the health status of the human female urogenital tract. our results indicate that is important to culture the vaginal discharge for streptococcus agalactiae and for prevalence of enterobacteriaceae and enterococci. lastly, the reasons for the prevalence of some microorganisms (gardnerella vaginalis, enterobacteriaceae  and enterococci, streptococcus agalactiae) in the population of infertile asymptomatic women need to be better analyzed especially after the recent studies correlating idiopathic infertility with the presence of cervical cytokines in women with an abnormal vaginal flora.

TI  == cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells of women with a history of preterm birth.
AB  == preterm birth is associated with elevated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tnfalpha at the maternal-fetal interface. previous studies have suggested that women with a history of preterm birth produce aberrantly strong inflammatory responses to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lps). however many intrauterine infections in women are associated with pathogens including ureaplasma urealyticum, mycoplasma hominis and streptococcus agalactiae (group b  streptococcus) that contain pro-inflammatory factors other than lps. we evaluated whether peripheral blood leukocytes from women with a history of preterm birth produce elevated amounts of tnfalpha upon stimulation with pathogens associated with preterm birth and if pre-treatment with aspirin, an anti-inflammatory medication, decreases the ex vivo production of this cytokine. heat-killed bacteria elicited increased tnfalpha production from leukocytes in a dose-dependent manner, but no differences in tnfalpha production between leukocytes from women with preterm birth and control women with term birth were detected. in women who consumed aspirin each day for one week, tnfalpha production was increased in leukocytes from control women stimulated with escherichia coli and u. urealyticum, but was reduced or unchanged in leukocytes from women with preterm birth. similar trends were observed for a subset of samples stimulated with u. urealyticum and assayed for il-6, il-10, il-1beta and  tnfalpha by bead array. we conclude that leukocytes from women with a history of  preterm birth do not have elevated pro-inflammatory responses to pathogens, and that reproductive history is associated with different effects of aspirin on pro-inflammatory cytokine production.

TI  == comparison of clinical symptoms scored according to the national institutes of health chronic prostatitis symptoms index and assessment of antimicrobial treatment in patients with chronic prostatitis syndrome.
AB  == we examined a total of 194 patients over 18 years of age with chronic prostatitis syndrome and no evidence of structural or functional lower genitourinary tract abnormalities. the following data were obtained for each patient: clinical history--the severity of chronic prostatitis symptoms scored by a croatian translation of the nih cpsi questionnaire, clinical status including digitorectal examination, urethral swab specimens, and selective samples of urine and expressed prostatic secretion, according to the 4-glass localization test (meares and stamey localization technique). patients were treated orally with antimicrobial agents in doses and duration according to clinical practice in croatia. an infectious etiology was determined in 169 (87%) patients. chlamydia trachomatis was the causative pathogen in 38 (20%), trichomonas vaginalis in 35 (18%), enterococcus in 36 (19%) and escherichia coli in 35 (18%) patients. in the remaining 25 patients the following causative pathogens were found: ureaplasma urealyticum, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. comparison of symptoms scores and effect on quality of life has shown that the most severe clinical presentation of disease was recorded in patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis caused by e. coli and enterococcus (p<0.001). clinical success was paralleled by bacteriological eradication in chronic bacterial prostatitis caused by c. trachomatis, enterococcus and e. coli (kappa >0.2<0.5), but not in inflammatory chronic pelvic pain syndrome caused by t. vaginalis.

TI  == simultaneous identification of 14 genital microorganisms in urine by use of a multiplex pcr-based reverse line blot assay.
AB  == the aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a sensitive method for the simultaneous identification of 14 urogenital potential pathogens. a multiplex pcr-based reverse line blot (mpcr/rlb) assay was developed to detect 14 urogenital pathogens or putative pathogens, namely trichomonas vaginalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis, ureaplasma parvum, u. urealyticum, gardnerella vaginalis, haemophilus influenzae, herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv1) and hsv2, n. meningitidis, mycoplasma hominis, m. genitalium, and adenovirus, using two species-specific primer pairs and probes for each. the method was validated using a reference strain or a well-characterized clinical isolate of each target organism and was found to be both sensitive and specific. the limits of detection for the mpcr/rlb assay varied among the 14 target organisms from 4.2 x 10(-1) to 7.0 x 10(-11) ng/microl of genomic dna. there were no cross-reactions among any of the probes. this method was used to test 529 first-voided urine specimens from male patients with  and without urethritis attending two sydney sexual health clinics. one or more target species were detected in 193 (36%) subjects. of 233 positive results, overall 216 (93%) were concordant between mpcr/rlb and a comparator method (culture and/or species-specific pcr), 9 were positive only by mpcr/rlb, and 8 were positive only by the comparator method. the mpcr/rlb method was an accurate, convenient, and inexpensive method for the detection of multiple potential pathogens in first-voided urine specimens from men.

TI  == a novel diagnostic tool for detecting neonatal infections using multiplex polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == background: in newborns with infections, it is necessary to detect various pathogens rapidly and accurately, because the infections are often fatal when diagnosis is delayed. however, no diagnostic tools that rapidly detect pathogens  causing neonatal infectious diseases are available. objectives: to establish a rapid diagnostic tool using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to detect 8 major pathogens that often cause neonatal infections, including group b streptococcus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, ureaplasma urealyticum, herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, and candida albicans, and to validate this tool in the neonatal  intensive care unit (nicu). methods: one hundred and thirty clinical samples were obtained from newborns with any infectious signs or histories. dna was extracted  from these samples and multiplex pcr was performed with a mixture of 8 primer pairs, all designed to amplify pathogenic dna and produce different sizes of amplicons. seventy-seven samples with suspicion of bacterial infections were also examined by bacterial culture to evaluate the accuracy of the multiplex pcr results. results: six of the 8 pathogens could be rapidly detected by our multiplex pcr method, within 3.5-4.5 h. these positive results led us to immediately diagnose and select proper drugs against each pathogen. in comparison with culture results, our test characteristics were as follows: specificity: 93%, negative predictive value: 96%, and concordance rate: 90%. conclusions: we have established and validated a rapid diagnostic tool for detecting pathogens using multiplex pcr, which may be useful for the confirmed diagnosis of neonatal infections in the nicu.

TI  == human papillomaviruses and genital co-infections in gynaecological outpatients.
AB  == background: high grade hpv infections and persistence are the strongest risk factors for cervical cancer. nevertheless other genital microorganisms may be involved in the progression of hpv associated lesions. methods: cervical samples  were collected to search for human papillomavirus (hpv), bacteria and yeast infections in gynaecologic outpatients. hpv typing was carried out by pcr and sequencing on cervical brush specimens. chlamydia trachomatis was identified by strand displacement amplification (sda) and the other microorganisms were detected by conventional methods. results: in this cross-sectional study on 857 enrolled outpatients, statistical analyses revealed a significant association of  hpv with c. trachomatis and ureaplasma urealyticum (at high density) detection, whereas no correlation was found between hpv infection and bacterial vaginosis, streptococcus agalactiae, yeasts, trichomonas vaginalis and u. urealyticum. mycoplasma hominis was isolated only in a few cases both in hpv positive and negative women and no patient was infected with neisseria gonorrhoeae. conclusion: although bacterial vaginosis was not significantly associated with hpv, it was more common among the hpv positive women. a significant association between hpv and c. trachomatis was found and interestingly also with u. urealyticum but only at a high colonization rate. these data suggest that it may  be important to screen for the simultaneous presence of different microorganisms  which may have synergistic pathological effects.

TI  == placental histological inflammation and reproductive tract infections in a low risk pregnant population in latvia.
AB  == background: to investigate the correlation of reproductive tract infections (rti) and endogenous vaginal flora at first antenatal consultation with placental histological inflammation. methods: in a follow-up study, 154 low risk women with no miscarriage risk factors were examined for the presence of neisseria gonorrhoeae, trichomonas vaginalis, chlamydia trachomatis, ureaplasma urealyticum, mycoplasma hominis, gardnerella vaginalis, streptococcus agalactiae  (gbs), staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis (gds) and bacterial vaginosis (bv). at delivery, outcome data were collected and the histology of the placenta  was studied. results: some 85 (56.3%) of all pregnant women had rti or endogenous vaginal flora. placental histological inflammation correlated with genital tract  colonisation with g. vaginalis (p =0.013), bv (p =0.031), s. aureus (p =0.04) and aerobic vaginitis (p =0.017). bv and bv-related g. vaginalis correlated with the  presence of parietal and placental chorioamnionitis in 53.8 and 43.5% of cases. genital tract colonisation with gds and other aerobic flora in combination with inflammatory vaginitis correlated with the presence of funisitis in 33.3 and 40.0% of cases. mycoplasmas increased the risk for intrauterine infection only when present in combination with other rtis (p =0.023). conclusion: histological  placental inflammation is associated with both bv and genital tract colonisation  with aerobic bacteria, while funisitis is associated with colonisation of aerobic bacteria at first prenatal visit before the 17th gestational week.

TI  == human neutrophil peptides in vaginitis/cervicitis of different etiology.
AB  == development of female genito-urinary infections depends on many factors, such as  immune system activity, virulence of microorganism and production of factors inhibiting the growth of microorganisms. taking into account the possibility of relapses or severe complications, it is very important to appropriately diagnose  and treat infections. because of recently observed increase of microbial resistance to antibiotics, researchers are looking for alternatives. in our study we evaluated and compared the concentration of human neutrophil peptides (hnp 1-3) in cervico-vaginal lavages (cvl), obtained from women with vaginitis/cervicitis. swabs from the posterior vaginal fornix and from the endocervical canal as well as cvl samples were obtained from 32 patients with vaginitis/cervicitis and 29 healthy women (control group). supernatants of cvl were used for determination of concentration of hnp by elisa. the difference between concentrations of hnp 1-3 in studied and control groups was statistically significant (p = 0.018). the maximal concentration was determined in patients with mixed infections (28.41 ng/ml), and group b streptococci, gbs, (28.06 ng/ml), the minimal concentrations in cases of c. trachomatis (mean concentrations did not differ from those in the control group: 16.93 ng/ml and 16.39 ng/ml, respectively). maximal correlation was determined for control-studied group with isolation of gbs (r = 0.79), and very high negative correlation for group of gbs - c. trachomatis (r = -0.98).

AB  == objective: to assess the in vitro effect of five bacterial strains isolated from  semen samples (escherichia coli, staphylococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus oralis, bacteroides ureolyticus, and ureaplasma urealyticum) on reactive oxygen intermediate (roi) release and lipid sperm membrane peroxidation in the coincubated suspensions of white blood cells (wbc) with spermatozoa. design: an in vitro model of semen infection. setting: basic research laboratory. patient(s): healthy normozoospermic volunteers and healthy blood donors. intervention(s): none. main outcome measure(s): chemiluminescent assay was used to evaluate roi generation by wbc. malondialdehyde (mda) concentration was determined in sperm lysates using high-performance liquid chromatography. result(s): of the bacterial strains tested, b. ureolyticus, s. haemolyticus, and  e. coli caused the greatest damage to sperm membrane lipids. an increase in mda levels in sperm lysates was a natural consequence of bacteria-induced roi generation. the wbc usually enhanced harmful activity of the infectious agent toward the cell membranes. conclusion(s): the harmful effect of bacteria on spermatozoa depends on the type and species of microorganisms invading, colonizing, or infecting the male genital tract and is associated with the accompanying oxidative stress. the presence of leukocytes in semen appears to be  the additional factor enhancing the sperm lipid membrane peroxidation, which may  affect the fertility status.

AB  == the aim of our study was to investigate the cervical immunoglobulin a concentration in women with threatened preterm delivery. immunoglobulin a concentration in the cervical mucus of 80 women with symptoms of preterm delivery was measured using radial immunodiffusion. the results were compared with those of 60 healthy pregnant women. concentrations of immunoglobulins in maternal serum were also measured. there was no significant difference of cervical immunoglobulin a (iga) concentration between women with threatened preterm delivery and controls: 53.98 (0.0-189.7) mg/l vs. 61.7 (1.4-400.9; p<0.4) mg/l (median, range). the median of cervical iga levels in the group of threatened preterm delivery did not differ significantly between patients delivered preterm  (n=34) or at term (n=46): 38.3 (0.0-187.9) vs. 65.7 (1.4-189.7; p<0.2) mg/l. women with a normal vaginal flora showed a significantly higher cervical iga concentration than those with a pathological colonization: 72.7 (0.0-187.9) vs. 42.5 (0.0-189.7) mg/l. patients with a pathological vaginal smear and preterm delivery had the lowest iga levels (35.0; 0.0-187.9 mg/l). measurement of cervical iga concentration does not differentiate between women who deliver before or at term.

TI  == intrapartum chlorhexidine vaginal irrigation and chorioamnion and placental microbial colonization.
AB  == objectives: to determine whether intrapartum chlorhexidine vaginal irrigation reduces microbial colonization of the chorioamnion or placenta. methods: secondary analysis was made of a randomized trial. cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, mycoplasma species and ureaplasma urealyticum were performed  using standard isolation techniques. results: the placentas of 83 trial participants allocated to chlorhexidine and 93 allocated to placebo underwent evaluation. these two groups were statistically balanced for risk factors for infection. aerobic bacteria were isolated from 47% of the chlorhexidine placentas vs. 51% of the placebo placentas (relative risk 0.9, 95% confidence interval 0.7-1.3), anaerobic bacteria from 30% and 35%, respectively (0.8, 0.5-1.3), group b streptococcus from 12% and 15% (0.8, 0.4-1.7), u. urealyticum from 18% and 29%  (0.6, 0.4-1.1), mycoplasma species from 6% and 11% (0.6, 0.2-1.6), and any organism from 57% and 67%, respectively (0.8, 0.7-1.1). conclusions: intrapartum  chlorhexidine vaginal irrigation was associated with non-significant reductions in the rates of placental microbial isolation.

TI  == [role of bacteria associated with sexually transmitted infections in the etiology of lower urinary tract infection in primary care].
AB  == introduction: urinary tract infections (uti) are the second most frequent type of infectious pathology treated in primary care clinics. the participation of microorganisms associated with sexually transmitted infection has been reported as a cause of uti; nevertheless this concept is still controversial. to gather data on this subject, we carried out a search for gardnerella vaginalis, ureaplasma urealyticum, mycoplasma hominis and streptococcus agalactiae besides the common microorganisms involved in uti. methods: a total of 1507 urine cultures from patients with a clinical diagnosis of low uti were analyzed. samples were inoculated onto 5% sheep blood agar and mcconkey agar, as well as hbt medium for g. vaginalis, and u9b broth and agar e broth for m. hominis and u. urealyticum. the following parameters were analyzed as possible risk factors: age, sex, pregnancy and diabetes status. results. there were 436 (28.9%) positive urine cultures. escherichia coli was isolated in 44.34% of cases. microorganisms  associated with sexually transmitted disease were found in 162 (37%): g. vaginalis (25.7%), u. urealyticum (5.9%), s. agalactiae (3.4%) and m. hominis (2%). uti were more frequent among the 20 to 40 year-old age group, in women and  in diabetic patients. conclusions: microorganisms associated with sexually transmitted disease were found in a large percentage of cultures, indicating the  need for studies to clarify their role in the etiology of uti.

TI  == vaginal bacterial flora activates rat peritoneal mast cells.
AB  == sixteen strains of physiological and pathological vaginal bacteria were tested for their ability to secrete histamine from rat peritoneal mast cells in vitro. we noticed that mycoplasma hominis-induced histamine release was very high (up to 53.6%). the stimulation of rat mast cells with staphylococccus cohnii, staphylococcus coagulase(-) (two strains), ureaplasma urealyticum, peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides capillosus, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae resulted in lower but significant histamine secretion (11.2%-17.5%). other bacteria strains (staphylococcus epidermidids, enterococcus  faecalis, escherichia coli, actinomyces naeslundii (two strains) and lactobacillus fermentum (two strains) caused very low (4.2% - 8.8%) histamine release.

TI  == [prevalence of associated microorganisms in genital discharge, argentina].
AB  == objective: there was a significant increase in the number of women demanding gynecological care in public hospital of the great buenos aires, argentina, between 1997 and 1998. it was necessary to update the prevalence of associated microorganisms in order to review the laboratory support and adjust prevention and control guidelines. methods: samples from vaginal and endocervical discharge, from total cases: 84 adolescents (15 to 19 years) and 784 adults (20-60 years) attended in 1997-1998, were studied. neisseria gonorrhoeae, streptococcus agalactiae, trichomonas vaginalis, candida spp, and bacterial vaginosis, were diagnosed applying direct detection methods and specific culture isolation. chlamydia trachomatis (antigen detection), ureaplasma urealyticum and mycoplasma  hominis (culture) were also studied in part of the population. results: patient care increased steadily from 1997 and there was an increase of 2.1 times from the first semester to the last one in 1998. bacterial vaginosis was the most prevalent disease in the adult group, with 23.8%; followed by candida spp 17.8%;  s. agalactiae 5.6%; t.vaginalis 2.4%. in 50.3% of total adult cases neither bacterial vaginosis or presence of any sought microorganisms, was detected. in the adolescents group the most frequent detection was candida spp with a 29.7%; bacterial vaginosis in 17.8%; followed by s. agalactiae 3.6%, t.vaginalis 2.4%. also in this group on an important number of cases, 46.4%, none bacterial vaginosis or the presence of the sought microorganism were found. in some of the  adult group, c. trachomatis (7/400) 1.76%, u. urealyticum (209/340) 61.4% and m.  hominis (45/272) 16.5% were detected. conclusions: bacterial vaginosis and candida spp prevalence is important in both groups. the absence of n. gonorrhoeae and lower prevalence of t. vaginalis and c. trachomatis is remarkable. a high prevalence of u. urealyticum and m. hominis were also detected, but the actual pathogenic role in adult women is still under discussion. the significant increase of attendance in the public system is due to social changes in the population and not due to changes in any particular pathology. laboratory support has to be adjusted to the most cost-effective procedures to solve the most prevalent problems.

TI  == intrauterine infection and prematurity.
AB  == intrauterine infection is a major cause of premature labor with and without intact membranes. intrauterine infection is present in approximately 25% of all preterm births and the earlier the gestational age at delivery, the higher the frequency of intra-amniotic infection. microorganisms may also gain access to the fetus before delivery. a fetal inflammatory response syndrome elicited in response to microbial products is associated with the impending onset of preterm  labor and also with multi-systemic organ involvement in the human fetus and a higher rate of perinatal morbidity. the most common microorganisms involved in intrauterine infections are ureaplasma urealyticum, fusobacterium species and mycoplasma hominis. the role of chlamydia trachomatis and viruses in preterm labor remain to be determined. use of molecular microbiology techniques to diagnose intrauterine infection may uncover the role of fastidious microorganisms that have not yet been discovered. antibiotic administration to patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria is associated with a significant reduction in the rate of preterm birth. however, such benefit has not been demonstrated for patients with bacterial vaginosis, or women who carry streptococcus agalactia, ureaplasma  urealyticum or trichomonas vaginalis. antibiotic administration to patients with  preterm premature rupture of membranes is associated with prolongation of pregnancy and a reduction in the rate of clinical chorioamnionitis and neonatal sepsis. the benefit has not been demonstrated in patients with preterm labor and  intact membranes. major efforts are required to determine why some women develop  an ascending intrauterine infection and others do not and also what interventions may reduce the deleterious effect of systemic fetal inflammation.

TI  == rho is not essential for viability or virulence in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == we have identified the gene for transcription termination factor rho in staphylococcus aureus. deletion of rho in s. aureus reveals that it is not essential for viability or virulence. we also searched the available bacterial genomic sequences for homologs of rho and found that it is broadly distributed and highly conserved. exceptions include streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus  pyogenes, mycoplasma genitalium, mycoplasma pneumoniae, ureaplasma urealyticum, and synechocystis sp. strain pcc6803, all of which appear not to possess a rho homolog. complementation studies indicate that s. aureus rho possesses the same activity as escherichia coli rho and that the rho inhibitor bicyclomycin is active against s. aureus rho. our results explain the lack of activity of bicyclomycin against many gram-positive bacteria and raise the possibility that the essentiality of rho may be the exception rather than the rule.

TI  == intrauterine infection and spontaneous midgestation abortion: is the spectrum of  microorganisms similar to that in preterm labor?
AB  == objective: to determine whether microorganisms associated with intrauterine infection and preterm labor play a contributing role in midgestation abortion. methods: a 4 year retrospective review of spontaneous midgestation abortions for  which autopsy and microbiological cultures of placental and fetal tissue were performed was conducted for a tertiary obstetrics hospital, which included a regional referral service for perinatal and fetal pathology. one hundred twenty-nine spontaneously delivered, nonmacerated, midgestation fetuses or stillbirths (of between 16 and 26 weeks' gestation) and placentas were examined and cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, yeasts, and genital mycoplasmas. results: microorganisms were recovered in 85 (66%) cases (57% placentas, 49% fetuses). among the culture positive cases, 81% had histological chorioamnionitis, 28% fetal pneumonitis, 38% clinical signs of infection, and 62% ruptured membranes at the time of miscarriage. these differed significantly from  culture-negative cases (44%, 5%, 13%, and 34%, respectively). group b streptococcus (gbs) was the most significant pathogen, recovered in 21 cases, 13  as the sole isolate, 94% with chorioamnionitis, and 47% in women with intact membranes. escherichia coli and ureaplasma urealyticum (22 and 24 cases, respectively) occurred mostly as mixed infections, with ruptured membranes. gbs,  mu urealyticum, and streptococcus anginosus group were individually associated with chorioamnionitis, bacteroides/prevotella and s. anginosus with fetal pneumonitis. the spectrum of microorganisms was similar to that in preterm labor  at later gestations; however, gbs appeared to be the most significant pathogen in midgestation miscarriage, especially with intact membranes. conclusions: unsuspected intrauterine infection underlies many spontaneous midgestation abortions. gbs is a key pathogen in this setting.

AB  == objective: to describe the etiologic study of the pertussis-like syndrome, not only as far as bordetella genus is concerned but also regarding the causative role of other microorganisms for a 11-year period (1988-1998). methods: in all specimens from patients suffering from pertussis-like cough the presence of bordetella spp., other bacteria, viruses, and mycoplasma was investigated. the analysed data included microbiological findings and epidemiologic issues (age, sex, hospital admission area, yearly distribution and seasonal period). results:  a total of 1,063 specimens were investigated, most of them nasopharyngeal aspirates (910), corresponding to 905 patients; a positive culture was obtained form 56.9 of these patients. b. pertussis was isolated from 10.5% of patients. as for other bacteria, haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae were also isolated, in 16.9% and 15.8% of occasions, respectively. the respiratory syncitial virus was isolated from 10.7% of patients and other viruses in 9.4%. among mycoplasma, ureaplasma urealyticum predominated, with a recovery rate of 2.9%. the male/female ratio was 495/410; the ages of 67.2% of patients ranged from 0 to 6 months; a total of 689 (76.1%) required hospital admission. the recovery of b. pertussis and adenoviruses predominated during spring and summer months. in contrast, h. influenzae, s. pneumoniae and respiratory syncitial virus were recovered more frequently during winter months. conclusions: most patients with pertussis-like syndrome are children aged less than 6 months. the recovery percentages of b. pertussis and respiratory syncitial virus are identical and therefore we think that the investigation of their presence in this syndrome is fully warranted as well as the search for other microorganisms, since clinical symptoms are commonly non-specific among infants.

AB  == objective: we designed this retrospective study to compare radiologic findings in premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (bpd) in whom gram-positive cocci (gpc), gram-negative bacilli (gnb), or ureaplasma urealyticum were colonized. another objective was to correlate the radiologic findings of these patients with the clinical severity of bpd. study design: we correlated serial tracheal aspirates with radiographic findings from 183 infants whose birth weight was < or = 1250 gm. bpd severity was assessed by oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age (36 w pca) and at the time of discharge. two radiologists independently scored films taken at birth and 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days of life. results: of the study population, 55% were male and 35% were black; 80% received surfactant and 69% received dexamethasone; 91% survived. gpc isolates from throat cultures were mainly staphylococcus [corrected] epidermidis and streptococcus haemolyticus. a superimposed gnb colonization was present in 37% of these infants. most common isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and escherichia coli. sepsis caused by gpc developed in 16% of all patients; 7% had sepsis caused by gnb. infants infected with gnb remained receiving oxygen at 36 w pca and at the time of discharge twice as often as those noninfected. radiologic findings: hyperinflation, interstitial changes, and generalized or localized emphysema were prominent features throughout. mean radiologic scores increased over time in a pattern similar among gpc, gnb, and u. urealyticum infected and noninfected infants. high radiologic scores were not predictive at any time of infants who needed supplemental oxygen at 28 days and at 36 w pca. infants infected with u. urealyticum were neither clinically nor radiologically different than noncolonized neonates. conclusion: gpc, gnb, and u. urealyticum airway colonization is not associated with particular radiographic changes at any time. gnb-infected infants had the most severe bpd course, and yet they were radiologically indistinguishable from the other patients. u. urealyticum colonization does not result in more clinically severe bpd or demonstrate a unique radiologic course.

TI  == history of macrolide use in pediatrics.
AB  == erythromycin, the prototypical macrolide, has been widely used since the 1950s in the management of pediatric infections. erythromycin is the drug of choice for infants and children with legionnaire's disease, pertussis, diphtheria, lower respiratory tract infections caused by mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia pneumoniae and chlamydia trachomatis and enteritis caused by campylobacter jejuni. it is also indicated for treatment of syphilis; for streptococcal, staphylococcal and pneumococcal infections; genital infections caused by ureaplasma urealyticum; and for the prevention of rheumatic fever and endocarditis in patients who are allergic to beta-lactam antibiotics. the new macrolides azithromycin and clarithromycin are also active against borrelia burgdorferi, helicobacter pylori, mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex, cryptosporidium spp. and toxoplasma gondii. erythromycin is associated with a low risk of serious side effects, although gastric distress occurs in a significant proportion of patients. drug interactions with theophylline, carbamazepine, warfarin, cyclosporine, terfenadine and digoxin limit erythromycin use. the newer macrolides azithromycin and clarithromycin are more stable, better absorbed and better tolerated than erythromycin. azithromycin is more active than erythromycin against haemophilus influenzae. excellent tissue and intracellular penetration may contribute to their clinical efficacy. in children both azithromycin and clarithromycin are indicated for acute otitis media caused by streptococcus pneumoniae, h. influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis and for pharyngitis/tonsillitis caused by streptococcus pyogenes. (as of december, 1996,  azithromycin for oral suspension was approved for community-acquired pneumonia in children caused by c. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, m. pneumoniae and s. pneumoniae.) claritromycin is also indicated for acute maxillary sinusitis, uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, pneumonia and disseminated mycobacterial infections. azithromycin and clarithromycin are associated with a lower incidence of gastrointestinal side effects, a low rate of drug discontinuation caused by side effects and a low potential for interaction with other drugs.

TI  == the role of ureaplasma urealyticum in adverse pregnancy outcome.
AB  == we investigated ureaplasma urealyticum genital tract colonization rates in an australian population to determine whether colonization was associated with adverse pregnancy outcome. women attending an antenatal clinic were evaluated for lower genital tract colonization at their first antenatal visit (162 women) and at 28 weeks' gestation (120 women). placentas from 92 women were cultured. u. urealyticum was the predominant isolate from the lower (57.4%) and upper (17.4%)  genital tract in this population of pregnant women. u. urealyticum was a persistent colonizer during mid-trimester of pregnancy (in 88% of women colonized) whereas m. hominis, g. vaginalis, and group b streptococcus were present as transient flora of the lower genital tract. lower genital tract colonization during pregnancy was not directly associated with adverse pregnancy  outcome. however preterm delivery in afebrile, asymptomatic women, could possibly be associated with chorioamnionitis (4 of 16 preterm births). screening of women  with a history of preterm birth may prevent upper genital tract infections and preterm delivery.

AB  == a total of 342 couples planning to undergo in-vitro fertilization (ivf) were examined for the presence of bacteria in semen prior to and during the procedure. pregnancy rates were analysed retrospectively to ascertain any adverse affects if > 10000 colony forming units (cfu)/ml bacteria were detected in the semen sample. the most common bacteria isolated from semen were enterococcus spp. (73%). the presence of these bacteria did not affect the pregnancy rate of the patients with positive cultures prior to (32%) or during (37%) the ivf procedure compared with  those patients in whom no bacteria were detected (32%). those patients with semen cultures positive for escherichia coli prior to the ivf procedure, but which cleared after treatment had a higher pregnancy rate (60%) compared with those patients who were positive for e.coli at the time of the attempt. the group of patients with staphylococcus aureus in the semen at the time of ivf also demonstrated a low pregnancy rate (17%). of the patients. 36 (11%) had positive ureaplasma cultures from the screening test carried out on the semen and 22% became pregnant after successful treatment. none of the three patients with persistently positive cultures became pregnant. in conclusion, the presence of enterococcus in semen does not affect pregnancy rates following ivf. e.coli, s.aureus and ureaplasma urealyticum may have a negative effect and should be treated.

TI  == bacterial 16s rdna polymerase chain reaction in the detection of intra-amniotic infection.
AB  == objective: bacterial polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was used to detect early subclinical intraamhiotic infection. we used universal primers which amplify a dna fragment of 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) from all known bacteria and sequenced the positive samples to identify the bacterial species. design: transabdominally  obtained amniotic fluid samples from 20 pregnant women with prelabour rupture of  the fetal membranes (prom), showing no signs of clinical infection, and 16 control samples were analysed with universal bacterial pcr. in addition, routine  bacterial culture and amniotic fluid glucose were studied. results: out of 20 prom patients, five were positive in the pcr. pcr detected ureaplasma urealyticum in two cases, haemophilus influenzae in one case, streptococcus oralis in one case and fusobacterium sp. in one case. only two of these were positive in a routine bacterial culture. both were multibacterial infections, which caused discrepancies between the pcr and culture results. two patients developed infectious complications: both were identified with the pcr assay. amniotic fluid glucose was lower in pcr positive patients compared with pcr negative patients. conclusion: bacterial 16s rdna pcr, in properly controlled conditions, promises to be a fast and reliable test for early intra-amniotic infection especially concerning ureaplasma urealyticum.

TI  == the tetracycline resistance gene tet(m) exhibits mosaic structure.
AB  == tetracycline resistance genes of the m class, tet(m), are typically found on mobile genetic elements as the conjugative transposons of gram-positive bacteria. by comparing the sequences of eight different tet(m) genes (from enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, ureaplasma urealyticum, and neisseria), a mosaic structure was detected which could be traced to two distinct alleles. the two alleles displayed a divergence of 8% and  a different g/c content. the block structure of these genes provides evidence for the contribution of homologous recombination to the evolution and the heterogeneity of the tet(m) locus. unlike described cases of chromosomally located mosaic loci, tet(m) is a relatively recently acquired determinant in the  species examined and it would appear that mosaic structure within tet(m) has evolved after acquisition of the gene by the mobile genetic elements upon which it is located.

TI  == unique susceptibility of patients with antibody deficiency to mycoplasma infection.
AB  == patients with congenital or acquired disorders of antibody production suffer from a wide variety of infections. they are most often bacterial and due to haemophilus influenzae or streptococcus pneumoniae. chronic pulmonary disease accounts for most of the deaths. while non-urogenital tract infections due to ureaplasma urealyticum or other mycoplasmas are unusual in individuals with normal resistance, patients with antibody deficiency demonstrate a unique susceptibility. with increasing frequency, patients with impaired humoral immunity have been shown to have a mycoplasmal infection that results in pneumonitis, sinusitis, cystitis, arthritis, osteomyelitis, or cellulitis. the mycoplasmas may be responsible for chronic sinopulmonary disease in a majority of such patients. awareness of the role these organisms play in causing infection in antibody-deficient patients and the institution of appropriate antibiotic therapy will contribute to an improvement in clinical outcome.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and spectrum of rifaximin, a new topical rifamycin derivative.
AB  == rifaximin, a rifamycin derivative, was evaluated in vitro to assess its spectrum  and potency against a wide variety of bacteria, yeasts, viruses, and parasites. high concentrations of rifaximin were often used to reflect topically achieved levels since this compound is poorly absorbed by oral route. like rifampin, rifaximin possessed best activity against staphylococcus spp. (mic50 < or = 0.015 microgram/ml), streptococcus spp. (mic50s, < or = 0.03-0.12 microgram/ml), enterococcus spp. (mic50s, 0.25-2 micrograms/ml), bacillus cereus (mic50, 0.06 microgram/ml), moraxella catarrhalis (mic50, < or = 0.03 microgram/ml), and haemophilus influenzae (mic50, 0.25 microgram/ml). rifaximin demonstrated potential use as a topical agent for bacterial vaginosis by inhibiting bacteroides bivius-disiens, gardnerella vaginalis, lactobacillus spp., and mobiluncus spp. strains (all mics < or = 1 microgram/ml). strains of haemophilus  ducreyi and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mic50s, 0.25 microgram/ml) were also inhibited. however, some organisms associated with genital tract infections were  rifaximin resistant, for example, candida spp., herpes virus, mycoplasmas, trichomonas vaginalis, and ureaplasma urealyticum. clinical trials appear warranted using rifaximin topical concentrations that will minimize mutations to  rifamycin resistance.

TI  == prostaglandin production by amnion and decidual cells in response to bacterial products.
AB  == media from bacterial cultures have been tested for actions on prostaglandin biosynthesis by human amnion and decidual cells. the bacterial species, which are commonly associated with intrauterine infections, were group b streptococcus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides fragilis, gardnerella vaginalis, neisseria gonorrhea, mycoplasma hominis and ureaplasma urealyticum. overall, low doses of bacterial products were stimulatory of amnion prostaglandin production, whereas high doses were inhibitory. a similar pattern of results was  obtained for effects on decidual prostaglandin production, although stimulatory actions at low doses were less pronounced. in all experiments interleukin 1 beta  consistently induced a stimulation of prostaglandin production that greatly exceeded that caused by any bacterial product. it is possible that the inhibitory action of high doses of bacterial products on prostaglandin biosynthesis may contribute to the poor course of labor experienced by women with chorioamnionitis. furthermore, these data lend credence to the view that the host response to infection (i.e. cytokine secretion) is the major mediator of subsequent preterm labor.

AB  == recently, strains of neisseria gonorrhoeae have been isolated which are highly resistant to tetracycline (mics of 16 to 64 micrograms/ml). this resistance was due to the acquisition of the resistance determinant tetm, a transposon-borne determinant initially found in the genus streptococcus and more recently in mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, and gardnerella vaginalis. in n. gonorrhoeae, the tetm determinant was located on a 25.2-megadalton plasmid. this  plasmid arose from the insertion of tetm into the 24.5-megadalton gonococcal conjugative plasmid. the tetm determinant could be transferred to suitable recipient strains of n. gonorrhoeae by both genetic transformation and conjugation.

TI  == endometrial cultures obtained by a triple-lumen method from afebrile and febrile  postpartum women.
AB  == transfundal endometrial cultures obtained from afebrile women who delivered vaginally were uniformly free of bacteria and contained ureaplasma urealyticum in only 2 of 14 women. a protected triple-lumen transcervical method to obtain an endometrial culture recovered organisms from 6 (43%) of the 14 women. compared with cultures from afebrile women, organisms were recovered from 51 (93%) of 55 febrile postpartum women by using the triple-lumen transcervical culture method (p less than .001). among febrile women there was a correlation between the recovery of group b streptococcus, enterococcus, gardnerella vaginalis, staphylococcus aureus, and anaerobic bacteria from the cervix and their recovery  from the endometrium. protected transcervical methods used to obtain postpartum endometrial cultures reduce cervical contamination, but semiquantitation of the culture is useful to further increase culture specificity.

TI  == polymicrobial early postpartum endometritis with facultative and anaerobic bacteria, genital mycoplasmas, and chlamydia trachomatis: treatment with piperacillin or cefoxitin.
AB  == a protected, triple-lumen transcervical culture method was used to recover organisms from the endometrium. at least one facultative or one anaerobic species of bacteria was recovered from 82% of the patients, and genital mycoplasmas were  recovered from 76% of the women with endometritis. bacteria together with genital mycoplasmas were present in 61% of the women, bacteria alone were present in 20%, genital mycoplasmas alone were present in 16%, and chlamydia trachomatis was isolated from 2% of the patients. the most common organisms included gardnerella  vaginalis, peptococcus spp., bacteroides spp., staphylococcus epidermidis, group  b streptococcus, and ureaplasma urealyticum. a randomized, double-blind regimen of either piperacillin or cefoxitin was equally successful in treating the postpartum endometritis.

TI  == screening for ureaplasma urealyticum infections in the neonate and the association with prematurity.
AB  == ureaplasma urealyticum has been implicated in gynaecological, obstetrical and neonatal pathology. increased levels of c-reactive protein and total igm concentrations in cord blood have often been used as a screening method for infectious disease in the fetus and the newborn. analysis of the isolation rate of u. urealyticum in function of the concentrations of these two parameters in cord blood showed that u. urealyticum was significantly (p less than 0.05) more frequently isolated when crp was above normal in cord blood. no correlation between the igm level in the newborn and the presence of u. urealyticum could be  established. a significant relationship was found (p less than 0.01) between ureaplasma isolation in the urine of mother and child on the one hand and gestational age on the other hand, which supports the hypothesis that u. urealyticum may play a role in preterm delivery.

TI  == prevalence of chlamydia trachomatis and other micro-organisms in women seeking abortions in pittsburgh, pennsylvania, united states of america.
AB  == the prevalence of chlamydia trachomatis, ureaplasma urealyticum, mycoplasma hominis, group b streptococcus, herpes simplex virus, and neisseria gonorrhoeae from cervical cultures obtained from 210 women seeking abortion in pittsburgh, pennsylvania, united states of america was 9.3%, 72.9%, 25.2%, 4.3%, 0.9%, and 0.9% respectively. cultures from 40/203 (19.7%) patients failed to produce any of these organisms. c trachomatis isolation was not associated with age, race, marital status, average family income, number of sexual partners, history of gonorrhoea or syphilis, or previous pregnancies, live births, or abortions, and 82.4% of women with chlamydial infections had had no urogenital symptoms in the preceding six months. the highest concentration of u urealyticum was 10(5) colour changing units (ccu)/ml, and about half of the positive ureaplasma cultures produced less than 10(3) ccu/ml of this organism. screening for c trachomatis, is encouraged to prevent neonatal morbidity and the common complication of pelvic inflammatory disease after abortion.

TI  == microbiology of the lower genital tract in postmenarchal adolescent girls: differences by sexual activity, contraception, and presence of nonspecific vaginitis.
AB  == the prevalence of selected microorganisms in the lower genital tract in postmenarchal adolescent girls was assessed, including vaginal gardnerella vaginalis, group b streptococcus, lactobacillus, mycoplasma species, ureaplasma urealyticum, staphylococcus aureus, and yeast, and endocervical mycoplasma species, u. urealyticum, chlamydia trachomatis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and trichomonas vaginalis. specific attention was focused on important sexually transmitted disease organisms, and differences in isolations by age, sexual activity, ethnicity, contraception, and the diagnosis of nonspecific vaginitis were measured. sexually active subjects had a mean of 6.05 organisms (sd = 3.16), compared with 3.12 organisms (sd = 3.92) in non-sexually active subjects (p = 0.001). sexually active subjects had significantly more vaginal g. vaginalis, lactobacilli, mycoplasma species, and u. urealyticum, as well as endocervical mycoplasma species and u. urealyticum, compared with non-sexually active subjects; c. trachomatis, n. gonorrhoea, and t. vaginalis were isolated exclusively from the sexually active group. significant differences in isolation  rates by ethnicity were found in vaginal mycoplasma species and u. urealyticum, and endocervical mycoplasma species, u. urealyticum, c. trachomatis, n. gonorrhoeae, and t. vaginalis. in general, organisms were isolated from blacks most frequently; n. gonorrhoea was isolated from blacks exclusively. differences  were found in microbiologic isolations by the presence or absence of nonspecific  vaginitis. vaginal g. vaginalis and mycoplasma species and endocervical mycoplasma species and u. urealyticum were found significantly more often in isolates from the group with nonspecific vaginitis. it is important to define the microbial flora of the lower genital tract in adolescent girls in order to understand its role in the pathogenesis of acute salpingitis.

TI  == [prevalence of 7 microorganisms in abnormal vaginal secretions (vaginitis)].
AB  == seven microorganisms (n. gonorrhoeae, c. albicans, t. vaginalis, g. vaginalis, m. hominis, u. urealyticum and streptococcus of group b) have been assayed in genital samplings of 164 asymptomatic women (control group) and of 374 women suffering from abnormal vaginal secretions (vaginitis group). all these bacteria  except group b streptococci were isolated in the vaginitis group more frequently  than in the control group (p less than 0.01). the proportion of negative cultures for all tested bacteria was 39% in the control group and 6.4% in the vaginitis group (p less than 0.01). this shows an association of these bacteria with 70% of the patients of the vaginitis group and with only 26% of the women of the control group (p less than 0.01). it is to be noted that the ph values are higher in the  group of women with vaginitis than in the control group (p less than 0.01). comparison of the microbial flora during "specific" an "non-specific" vaginitis indicates that g. vaginalis is isolated more frequently in patients with non-specific vaginitis than among those with specific vaginitis (p less than 0.01). likewise, m. hominis is isolated more frequently in groups of women with either non-specific vaginitis or t. vaginalis vaginitis, than in groups of patients with a c. albicans vaginitis (p less than 0,01). the results of this study indicate that there is a causal relationship between vaginitis and the presence of t. vaginalis. c. albicans, g. vaginalis, m. hominis or n. gonorrhoeae, either as a single or a mixed infection, and that there is a relationship between increased ph values and abnormal vaginal secretions.

TI  == urethral syndrome (abacterial cystitis)--search for a pathogen.
AB  == thirty-one women with the recurrent urethral syndrome (abacterial cystitis) had extensive microbiological, cytological and histological investigations. a streptococcus species was isolated from the bladder aspirate of one patient, a wall-deficient streptococcus species from two others and both a lactobacillus species and ureaplasma urealyticum from another. a possible microbiological cause was therefore identified in the bladder in only 4 of the 31 patients. a lactobacillus species was isolated from the bladder aspirate of one control subject. lactobacilli were grown in the voided urine of the majority of patients  and in seven of the eight control subjects. chlamydia trachomatis and herpes simplex were isolated from the cervix and the urethra of one patient. urethral cytology was normal in all patients. trigonitis was noted at cystoscopy in 26 of  the 31 patients. bladder biopsies showed squamous metaplasia in 15 and lymphocytic infiltration of the lamina propria in 29, giving support to an inflammatory aetiology of this enigmatic syndrome.

TI  == prevalence of low genital tract infectious agents in young israeli women.
AB  == low genital tract infectious agents were examined 411 times in 386 young women. each examination included anamnesis, physical examination and broad-spectrum microbiologic analysis for the detection of: ureaplasma urealyticum, chlamydia trachomatis, trichomonas vaginalis, candida species, mycoplasma hominis, streptococcus beta hemolyticus group b, hemophilus vaginalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae and syphilis serology. three hundred and six patients were symptomatic for low genital tract infection and 80 were asymptomatic. most patients were young, 19.6 +/- 1.7 (sd) years old, single (84.7%) and sexually active (87.4%). u. urealyticum and c. trachomatis were the most common agents recovered in 43.9 and 40.8% of symptomatic patients, respectively. all agents were isolated more frequently in the symptomatic group, but statistically significant group comparisons were obtained only for candida sp. (p less than 0.001), t. vaginalis (p less than 0.005) and m. hominis (p less than 0.05). n. gonorrhoeae was isolated in only one case (0.3%), which may reflect technical difficulties or a true very low prevalence of this agent. clinical diagnoses of candidiasis and trichomoniasis in symptomatic patients were confirmed by laboratory results in only 34.9 and 54.9%, whereas negative clinical diagnoses were confirmed in 83.9 and 73.2%, respectively.

TI  == association of ureaplasma urealyticum in the placenta with perinatal morbidity and mortality.
AB  == we investigated the presence of ureaplasmas, mycoplasmas, chlamydiae, fungi, aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, and cytomegalovirus in fetal membranes and evaluated their association with perinatal morbidity and mortality. we cultured 801 placentas from three groups of subjects (144 who died in the perinatal period, 452 neonates admitted to the intensive-care unit, and 205 controls). ureaplasma urealyticum, mycoplasma hominis, or both were isolated from 21 per cent of placentas of premature and term infants who died in the perinatal period, 25 per cent of those admitted to intensive care, and 11 per cent of controls. gestational age and birth weight were inversely related to isolation of ureaplasma, and chorioamnionitis was positively related to isolation. the presence of ureaplasmas in the placenta suggests the transcervical migration of these microorganisms from the lower genitourinary tract. these data show a strong association between ureaplasma infection of the placenta and low birth weight of  the neonate and suggest that the association is causal.
