TI  == probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus downregulates fcer1 and hrh4 expression in human mast cells.
AB  == aim: to investigate the effects of four probiotic bacteria and their combination  on human mast cell gene expression using microarray analysis. methods: human peripheral-blood-derived mast cells were stimulated with lactobacillus rhamnosus  (l. rhamnosus) gg (lgg((r))), l. rhamnosus lc705 (lc705), propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii js (pjs) and bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb12 (bb12) and their combination for 3 or 24 h, and were subjected to global microarray analysis using an affymetrix genechip((r)) human genome u133 plus 2.0  array. the gene expression differences between unstimulated and bacteria-stimulated samples were further analyzed with gorilla gene enrichment analysis and visualization tool and mev multiexperiment viewer-tool. results: lgg and lc705 were observed to suppress genes that encoded allergy-related high-affinity ige receptor subunits alpha and gamma (fcer1a and fcer1g, respectively) and histamine h4 receptor. lgg, lc705 and the combination of four probiotics had the strongest effect on the expression of genes involved in mast cell immune system regulation, and on several genes that encoded proteins with a  pro-inflammatory impact, such as interleukin (il)-8 and tumour necrosis factor alpha. also genes that encoded proteins with anti-inflammatory functions, such as il-10, were upregulated. conclusion: certain probiotic bacteria might diminish mast cell allergy-related activation by downregulation of the expression of high-affinity ige and histamine receptor genes, and by inducing a pro-inflammatory response.

TI  == persistence of probiotic strains in the gastrointestinal tract when administered  as capsules, yoghurt, or cheese.
AB  == most clinical studies of probiotics use freeze-dried, powdered bacteria or bacteria packed in capsules. however, probiotics are commercially available in various food matrices, which may affect their persistence in the gastrointestinal tract. the objective of the study was to compare oral and faecal recovery during  and after administration of a combination of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lc705, propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii js, and bifidobacterium  animalis subsp. lactis bb12 as capsules, yoghurt, or cheese. this randomized, parallel-group, open-label trial (n=36) included a 4-week run-in, 2-week intervention, and 3-week follow-up period. participants consumed 10(10)cfu/day of probiotic combination and provided saliva and faecal samples before, during, and  after the intervention. strain-specific real-time pcr was used to quantify the strains. l. rhamnosus gg was the only probiotic strain regularly recovered in saliva samples. during the intervention period it was recovered in the saliva of  88% of the volunteers at least once. no difference was found between the yoghurt  and cheese groups. at the end of the intervention, l. rhamnosus gg and lc705 counts were high in faecal samples of all product groups (8.08 and 8.67log(10) genome copies/g, respectively). there was no matrix effect on strain quantity in  faeces or the recovery time after ceasing the intervention. for p. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii js and b. animalis subsp. lactis bb12, a matrix effect was found at the end of the intervention (p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively) and in the recovery time during follow-up (p<0.05 for both). yoghurt yielded the highest faecal quantity of js and bb12 strains (8.01 and 9.89log(10) genome copies/g, respectively). the results showed that the administration matrix did not influence the faecal quantity of lactobacilli, but affected faecal counts of propionibacteria and bifidobacteria that were lower when consumed in cheese. thus, the consumption of probiotics in yoghurt matrix is highly suitable for studying potential health benefits and capsules provide a comparable means of administration when the viability of the strain in the capsule product is confirmed.

TI  == probiotic intervention has strain-specific anti-inflammatory effects in healthy adults.
AB  == aim: to evaluate the effects of three potentially anti-inflammatory probiotic bacteria from three different genera on immune variables in healthy adults in a clinical setting based on previous in vitro characterization of cytokine responses. methods: a total of 62 volunteers participated in this randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled parallel group intervention study. the volunteers were randomized to receive a milk-based drink containing either lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg), bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb12 (bb12), or propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii js (pjs) or a placebo  drink for 3 wk. venous blood and saliva samples were taken at baseline and on d 1, 7 and 21. fecal samples were collected at baseline and at the end of intervention. results: the serum hscrp expressed as the median auc(0-21) (minus baseline) was 0.018 mg/l in the placebo group, -0.240 mg/l in the lgg group, 0.090 mg/l in the bb12 group and -0.085 mg/l in the pjs group (p = 0.014). in vitro production of tnf-alpha from in vitro cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) was significantly lower in subjects receiving lgg vs placebo. il-2 production from pbmc in the bb12 group was significantly lower compared with the  other groups. conclusion: in conclusion, probiotic bacteria have strain-specific  anti-inflammatory effects in healthy adults.

TI  == clinical trial: multispecies probiotic supplementation alleviates the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and stabilizes intestinal microbiota.
AB  == background: irritable bowel syndrome is the most common diagnosis in gastroenterology. trials suggest certain probiotics to be beneficial. aim: to investigate the effects of multispecies probiotic supplementation (lactobacillus  rhamnosus gg, l. rhamnosus lc705, propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii js and bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb12) on abdominal symptoms, quality  of life, intestinal microbiota and inflammatory markers in irritable bowel syndrome. methods: eighty-six irritable bowel syndrome patients (rome ii criteria) participated in this randomized, placebo-controlled 5-month intervention. patients were randomized to receive daily either multispecies probiotic supplementation or placebo. irritable bowel syndrome symptoms, quality  of life, microarray-based intestinal microbiota stability (n = 20), serum cytokines and sensitive c-reactive protein were monitored. results: the composite irritable bowel syndrome score had at 5 months decreased 14 points (95% ci: -19 to -9) from baseline with the multispecies probiotic vs. three points (95% ci: -8 to 1) with placebo (p = 0.0083). especially, distension and abdominal pain were affected. a stabilization of the microbiota was observed, as the microbiota similarity index increased with the probiotic supplementation (1.9 +/- 3.1), while it decreased with placebo (-2.9 +/- 1.7). no differences were seen in c-reactive protein. conclusions: this multispecies probiotic seems to be an effective and safe option to alleviate symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, and  to stabilize the intestinal microbiota.

TI  == safety assessment of dairy microorganisms: propionibacterium and bifidobacterium.
AB  == the genera propionibacterium and bifidobacterium are clustered in the class actinobacteria and form the anaerobic branch of coryneform bacteria. the dairy propionibacteria comprising four species p. freudenreichii, p. acidipropionici, p. jensenii and p. thoenii are industrially important as starter cultures in hard-cheese ripening and recently also as protective bio-preservatives and probiotics. these four species are considered as safe whereas cutaneous propionibacterium species (also named "acnes group") are pathogens. in contrast,  bifidobacteria in fermented dairy products and milk powder are exclusively used as probiotics; selected strains of several species (out of more than thirty) contribute to this task. it has been only rarely found that commensal bifidobacteria have been connected with certain dental and other infections. consequently, only one single species, bifidobacterium dentium, is recognized as  pathogenic. genome sequence analysis of bifidobacterium longum and molecular biological analysis of other probiotic strains confirmed so far the absence of virulence and pathogenecity factors. however, tetracycline resistance genes tet(w), although probably not easy transferable, were found in bifidobacterium strains, also in bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, the worldwide most used  industrial strain. conclusively, strains from the propionibacterium and bifidobacterium species in dairy food generally represent so far no health hazards.
