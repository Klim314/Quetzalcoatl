functional analysis and induction of four novel goose (anser cygnoides) avian beta-defensins in response to salmonella enteritidis infection.
in the current study, four novel avian beta-defensins (avbds) (avbd2, 5, 9, and 10) were identified in tissues from the chinese goose (anser cygnoides). the antibacterial activity of the avbds showed that all of these avbds exhibited antibacterial activity against most of the bacteria investigated (p<0.01). in addition, antibacterial activity of all of the avbds against staphylococcus aureus and pasteurella multocida decreased significantly or was completely abolished at 150mm nacl (p<0.01). none of the avbds showed hemolytic activity. avbd2 and avbd10 were expressed widely, whereas avbd5 and avbd9 mrnas were expressed in a limited number of geese tissues. avbd9 was significantly induced in some immune tissues from geese after salmonella enteritidis infection. the others were significantly upregulated in small intestine and some immune tissues of the geese (p<0.01). the present results suggest that the avbds are part of the host defense mechanism of the goose.
