TI  == a lactose fermentation product produced by lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, acetate, inhibits the motility of flagellated pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == many strains of lactic acid bacteria have been used for the production of probiotics. some metabolites produced by lactic acid bacteria impair the motilities of pathogenic bacteria. because bacterial motility is strongly associated with virulence, the metabolic activities of lactic acid bacteria are effective for suppressing bacterial infections. here we show that lactose fermentation by lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis inhibits the motility of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. a single-cell tracking and rotation assay for a single flagellum showed that the swimming behaviour of salmonella was severely but transiently impaired through disruption of flagellar rotation on exposure to media cultivated with lac. lactis. using a ph-sensitive fluorescent protein, we observed that the intracellular ph of salmonella was decreased because of some fermentation products of lac. lactis. we identified acetate as the lactose fermentation product of lac. lactis triggering the paralysis of salmonella flagella. the motilities of pseudomonas, vibrio and leptospira strains were also severely disrupted by lactose utilization by lac. lactis. these results highlight the potential use of lac. lactis for preventing infections by multiple  bacterial species.

TI  == biophysical characterization of the type iii secretion tip proteins and the tip proteins attached to bacterium-like particles.
AB  == bacterium-like particles (blps), derived from lactococcus lactis, offer a self-adjuvanting delivery vehicle for subunit protein vaccines. proteins can be specifically loaded onto the blps via a peptidoglycan anchoring (pa) domain. in this study, the tip proteins ipad, sipd, and lcrv belonging to type iii secretion systems of shigella flexneri, salmonella enterica, and yersinia enterocolitica, respectively, were fused to the pa and loaded onto the blps. herein, we biophysically characterized these nine samples and condensed the spectroscopic results into three-index empirical phase diagrams (epds). the epds show distinctions between the ipad/sipd and lcrv subfamilies of tip proteins, based on their physical stability, even upon addition of the pa. upon attachment to the blps, the blps become defining moiety in the spectroscopic measurements, leaving  the tip proteins to have a subtle yet modulating effect on the structural integrity of the tip proteins-blps binding. in summary, this work provides a comprehensive view of physical stability of the tip proteins and tip protein-blps and serves as a baseline for screening of excipients to increase the stability of the tip protein-blps for future vaccine formulation.

TI  == live vaccination tactics: possible approaches for controlling visceral leishmaniasis.
AB  == vaccination with durable immunity is the main goal and fundamental to control leishmaniasis. to stimulate the immune response, small numbers of parasites are necessary to be presented in the mammalian host. similar to natural course of infection, strategy using live vaccine is more attractive when compared to other  approaches. live vaccines present the whole spectrum of antigens to the host immune system in the absence of any adjuvant. leishmanization was the first effort for live vaccination and currently used in a few countries against cutaneous leishmaniasis, in spite of their obstacle and safety. then, live attenuated vaccines developed with similar promotion of creating long-term immunity in the host with lower side effect. different examples of attenuated strains are generated through long-term in vitro culturing, culturing under drug  pressure, temperature sensitivity, and chemical mutagenesis, but none is safe enough and their revision to virulent form is possible. attenuation through genetic manipulation and disruption of virulence factors or essential enzymes for intracellular survival are among other approaches that are intensively under study. other designs to develop live vaccines for visceral form of leishmaniasis  are utilization of live avirulent microorganisms such as lactococcus lactis, salmonella enterica, and leishmania tarentolae called as vectored vaccine. apparently, these vaccines are intrinsically safer and can harbor the candidate antigens in their genome through different genetic manipulation and create more potential to control leishmania parasite as an intracellular pathogen.

TI  == a flagellin-producing lactococcus strain: interactions with mucin and enteropathogens.
AB  == bacillus cereus ch is a probiotic strain used in human nutrition whose adhesion to mucin is dependent on its surface-associated flagellin. flagellins from the surface of several probiotic bacillus strains were efficiently extracted with 5 m licl and identified by peptide fingerprinting. based on the proteomic analysis, cloning of the gene coding for the flagellin of b. cereus ch was performed in the lactococcal vector pnz8110 under the control of a nisin-inducible promoter. the resulting strain, lactococcus lactis ch, produced a surface-associated flagellin  after 6 h of induction with nisin. the recombinant lactococcus strain adhered strongly to mucin-coated polystyrene plates, whilst inhibiting competitively the  adhesion of the pathogens escherichia coli lmg2092 and salmonella enterica ssp. enterica lmg15860 to the same molecule. strain ch could be used in further experimentation for the characterization of the molecular mechanism of action of  this probiotic b. cereus ch flagellin.

TI  == inhibitory spectra and modes of antimicrobial action of gallotannins from mango kernels (mangifera indica l.).
AB  == this study investigated the antimicrobial activities and modes of action of penta-, hexa-, hepta-, octa-, nona-, and deca-o-galloylglucose (gallotannins) isolated from mango kernels. the mics and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) against food-borne bacteria and fungi were determined using a critical dilution assay. gram-positive bacteria were generally more susceptible to gallotannins than were gram-negative bacteria. the mics of gallotannins against bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, clostridium botulinum, campylobacter jejuni,  listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus were 0.2 g liter(-1) or less; enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and salmonella enterica were inhibited by 0.5 to 1 g liter(-1), and lactic acid bacteria were resistant. the use of lipopolysaccharide mutants of s. enterica indicated that the outer membrane confers resistance toward gallotannins. supplementation of lb medium with iron eliminated the inhibitory activity of gallotannins against staphylococcus aureus, and siderophore-deficient mutants of s. enterica were less resistant toward gallotannins than was the wild-type strain. hepta-o-galloylglucose sensitized lactobacillus plantarum tmw1.460 to hop extract, indicating inactivation of hop resistance mechanisms, e.g., the multidrug resistance (mdr) transporter hora. carbohydrate metabolism of lactococcus lactis mg1363, a conditionally respiring organism, was influenced by hepta-o-galloylglucose when grown under aerobic conditions and in the presence of heme but not under anaerobic conditions, indicating that gallotannins influence the respiratory chain. in conclusion, the  inhibitory activities of gallotannins are attributable to their strong affinity for iron and likely additionally relate to the inactivation of membrane-bound proteins.

TI  == investigation of the mechanisms by which listeria monocytogenes grows in porcine  gallbladder bile.
AB  == the food-borne pathogen listeria monocytogenes is known to colonize the lumen of  the gallbladder in infected mice and to grow rapidly in this environment (j. hardy et al., science 303:851-853, 2004). however, relatively little is known about the mechanisms utilized by the pathogen to survive and grow in this location. we utilized gallbladder bile (gb bile) isolated directly from porcine gallbladders as an ex vivo model of gallbladder growth. we demonstrate that gb bile is generally nontoxic for bacteria and can readily support growth of a variety of bacterial species including l. monocytogenes, lactococcus lactis, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, and escherichia coli. significantly, l.  monocytogenes grew at the same rate as the nonpathogenic species listeria innocua, indicating that the pathogen does not possess specialized mechanisms that enable growth in this environment. however, when we reduced the ph of gb bile to ph 5.5 in order to mimic the release of bile within the small intestine,  the toxicity of gb bile increased significantly and specific resistance mechanisms (sigma b, bsh, and bile) were essential for survival of the pathogen under these conditions. in order to identify genetic loci that are necessary for  growth of l. monocytogenes in the gallbladder, a mariner transposon bank was created and screened for mutants unable to replicate in gb bile. this led to the  identification of mutants in six loci, including genes encoding enzymes involved  in purine metabolism, amino acid biosynthesis, and biotin uptake. although gb bile does not represent a significant impediment to bacterial growth, specific metabolic processes are required by l. monocytogenes in order to grow in this environment.

TI  == anti-inflammatory properties of probiotic bacteria on salmonella-induced il-8 synthesis in enterocyte-like caco-2 cells.
AB  == invasion of the gut by pathogenic salmonella leads to production of il-8 that initiates inflammatory reactions to combat the bacterium. however, its persistent production causes tissue damage and interventions that suppress il-8 production prevent tissue damage. we hypothesised that probiotics could mediate their benefits via inhibition of il-8 synthesis. caco-2 cells were infected with probiotic bifidobacterium infantis w52, lactobacillus casei w56, lactococcus lactis w58, lactobacillus acidophilus w70, bifidobacterium bifidum w23, or lactobacillus salivarius w24 or pathogenic salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis 857 at 0, 0.2, 1, 2, 10, 20, 100 or 200 bacterial cells/caco-2 cell for 1 hour. cells were also exposed to a combination of one probiotic bacterium (200 bacterial cells/caco-2 cell) and the graded numbers of salmonella as either  co-incubation (1 hour) or pre-incubation of the probiotic bacterium (1 hour) followed by salmonella (1 hour). the cells recovered for 2 or 24 hours. il-8 and  hsp70 were determined by elisa and western blot respectively. both probiotics and salmonella induced a dose- and time-dependent synthesis of il-8 but probiotics induced far lower il-8 levels than salmonella. the salmonella-induced il-8 was significantly suppressed by b. infantis w52, l. casei w56 and l. lactis w58 at low numbers of salmonella (0.2 to 20 bacterial cells/caco-2 cell) and within 2 hours of recovery. the observed probiotic-mediated reduction in il-8 secretion was transient, and lost after a few hours. in addition, these three probiotics induced a significant increase in hsp70 expression while l. acidophilus w70, b. bifidum w23 and l. salivarius w24 induced a weak hsp70 expression and could not suppress the salmonella-induced il-8 synthesis. we conclude that suppression of salmonella-induced il-8 synthesis by caco-2 cells is exhibited by probiotics that induce expression of hsp70, suggesting that the protective role of probiotics could be mediated, at least in part, via hsp70 expression. this suppression is limited to a low number of infecting pathogenic salmonella.

TI  == evaluation of a mathematical model structure describing the effect of (gel) structure on the growth of listeria innocua, lactococcus lactis and salmonella typhimurium.
AB  == aims: to evaluate a novel secondary model structure (int j food microbiol 2008; 128: 67) that describes the effect of medium structure on the maximum specific growth rate (mu(max)) of salmonella typhimurium on the growth of s. typhimurium,  listeria innocua, lactococcus lactis and listeria monocytogenes. methods and results: in the present study, the novel secondary model is validated for s. typhimurium in more realistic media, namely, pasteurized milk and a cheese mimicking medium. the predictions were accurate. next, the secondary model structure was evaluated in a two step and a global regression procedure on literature data. on the one hand, the growth of two other micro-organisms, namely l. innocua and l. lactis, in monoculture for varying gelatine concentrations was  tested and on the other hand the growth rate of l. monocytogenes was fitted in a  broth of which the viscosity was altered with polyvinylpyrrolidone. the model was able to describe the effect of increasing gelatine concentration or viscosity accurately. conclusions: the proposed secondary model structure is able to describe the effect of gelatine concentration on the mu(max) of the micro-organisms tested in this study. significance and impact of the study: in predictive microbiology, much attention has been paid to the effect of food structure on the mu(max) of bacteria. however, to the authors' knowledge, a lack  of secondary models still exists to describe this effect. although the proposed model is empirical, the model parameters have clear biological meaning. the predictive power of the model to describe the effect of food structure is clearly illustrated.

TI  == innate inflammatory responses to the gram-positive bacterium lactococcus lactis.
AB  == lactococcus lactis is a non-pathogenic and non-colonizing gram-positive bacterium commonly used in the dairy industry. to support the potential applications of this bacterium, such as use as an oral live vaccine, it is of interest to investigate the adjuvant properties of l. lactis. we compared the proinflammatory effects of l. lactis with two non-pathogenic gram-negative bacteria: escherichia  coli and salmonella typhi, a widely studied live vaccine. the gene expression profiles of chemokines induced by the three bacteria were examined in macrophages in vitro and in cells recruited into murine air-pouches in vivo. in addition, we  studied the effect of co-incubating bacteria with dendritic cells (dcs) generated from mice bone marrow. we demonstrate that l. lactis exhibits proinflammatory effects, which indicates a capacity for adjuvanticity by this bacterium.

TI  == display of heterologous proteins on the surface of lactococcus lactis using the h and w domain of prtb from lactobacillus delburueckii subsp. bulgaricus as an anchoring matrix.
AB  == aims: the aim of this study was to develop a cell-surface display system for foreign antigens on the surface of a lactococcus lactis strain using an h and w domain of prtb from lactobacillus delburueckii subsp. bulgaricus as an anchoring  matrix. methods and results: to construct a cell-surface display pacl1 vector, a  derivative of psece1 vector, we amplified the h and w domain of the cell-surface  proteinase prt b from lact. bulgaricus using specific primers and then cloned it  into a site downstream of the secretion signal sequence in the psece1 vector. the new system, designed for cell-surface display of recombinant proteins on l. lactis, was evaluated by the expression and display of the flic protein of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis as a reporter gene (palc1:flic). the expression of the flic protein by the transformed cells was analysed by western blot analysis, and the localization of flic on the cell surface was confirmed by  immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry analysis. a specific band corresponding in size (approx. 110 kda) to flic plus the anchor residues was detected by anti-flic antibody in the cell extract of l. lactis h61 harbouring palc1:flic, but not l. lactis h61 harbouring palc1. in addition, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy revealed flic-specific positive signals and a significant increase of fluorescence, respectively, in cells harbouring palc1:flic compared with that in control cells harbouring the parental palc1 plasmid. these findings demonstrated that flic was successfully displayed on the  cell surface by the anchor domain of prtb. conclusions: a palc1 vector using the  h and w domain of prtb from lact. bulgaricus as an anchoring matrix can be used to successfully display the flic protein on the surface of l. lactis. significance and impact of the study: this novel way of displaying heterologous proteins on the cell surface of l. lactis using the prtb anchor domain should prove useful for the delivery of antigens and other proteins.

TI  == bioprotection of golden delicious apples and iceberg lettuce against foodborne bacterial pathogens by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria were isolated from fresh vegetables and fruit and its ability to inhibit the growth of foodborne human pathogens (escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium, and staphylococcus aureus) was tested using the agar spot assay. eighteen isolates showed a strong antagonistic capacity and were further characterised and identified using 16s rdna sequencing and api 50ch. most of them pertained to leuconostoc spp. and lactobacillus plantarum, and a few corresponded to weissella spp. and lactococcus lactis. growth and efficacy of control of foodborne pathogen test bacteria by selected strains were tested in wounded golden delicious apples  and iceberg lettuce leaf cuts. the strains grew on the substrates and did not cause negative effects on the general aspect of tissues of apple or lettuce. treatment of apple wounds and lettuce cuts with the antagonistic strains reduced  the cell count of s. typhimurium and e .coli by 1 to 2 log cfu/wound or g, whereas the growth of l. monocytogenes was completely inhibited. results support  the potential use of lactic acid bacteria as bioprotective agents against foodborne human pathogens in ready-to-eat fresh fruit and vegetable products.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of flavonoids extracted from bergamot (citrus bergamia risso) peel, a byproduct of the essential oil industry.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of flavonoid-rich fractions derived from bergamot peel, a byproduct from the citrus fruit processing industry and the influence of enzymatic deglycosylation on their activity against different bacteria and yeast. methods and results: bergamot ethanolic fractions were tested against gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida, salmonella enterica), gram-positive bacteria (listeria innocua, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, lactococcus lactis) and the yeast saccharomyces  cerevisiae. bergamot fractions were found to be active against all the gram-negative bacteria tested, and their antimicrobial potency increased after enzymatic deglycosylation. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of the fractions and the pure flavonoids, neohesperidin, hesperetin (aglycone), neoeriocitrin, eriodictyol (aglycone), naringin and naringenin (aglycone), were found to be in the range 200 to 800 microg ml(-1). the interactions between three bergamot flavonoids were also evaluated. conclusion: the enzyme preparation pectinase 62l  efficiently converted common glycosides into their aglycones from bergamot extracts, and this deglycosylation increased the antimicrobial potency of citrus  flavonoids. pairwise combinations of eriodictyol, naringenin and hesperetin showed both synergistic and indifferent interactions that were dependent on the test indicator organism. significance and impact of the study: bergamot peel is a potential source of natural antimicrobials that are active against gram-negative  bacteria.

TI  == a functional homing endonuclease in the bacillus anthracis nrde group i intron.
AB  == the essential bacillus anthracis nrde gene carries a self-splicing group i intron with a putative homing endonuclease belonging to the giy-yig family. here, we show that the nrde pre-mrna is spliced and that the homing endonuclease cleaves an intronless nrde gene 5 nucleotides (nt) upstream of the intron insertion site, producing 2-nt 3' extensions. we also show that the sequence required for efficient cleavage spans at least 4 bp upstream and 31 bp downstream of the cleaved coding strand. the position of the recognition sequence in relation to the cleavage position is as expected for a giy-yig homing endonuclease. interestingly, nrde genes from several other bacillaceae were also susceptible to cleavage, with those of bacillus cereus, staphylococcus epidermidis (nrde1), b. anthracis, and bacillus thuringiensis serovar konkukian being better substrates than those of bacillus subtilis, bacillus lichenformis, and s. epidermidis (nrde2). on the other hand, nrde genes from lactococcus lactis, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, and corynebacterium ammoniagenes were not cleaved. intervening sequences (ivss) residing in protein-coding genes are often found in enzymes involved in dna metabolism, and the ribonucleotide reductase nrde gene is a frequent target for self-splicing ivss. a comparison of  nrde genes from seven gram-positive low-g+c bacteria, two bacteriophages, and nocardia farcinica showed five different insertion sites for self-splicing ivss within the coding region of the nrde gene.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of lactic acid bacteria and yeast-lab cultures isolated  from traditional fermented milk against pathogenic escherichia coli and salmonella enteritidis strains.
AB  == the survival and growth of escherichia coli 3339 and salmonella enteritidis 949575 isolated from human clinical samples, in milk fermented with lactic acid bacteria (lab) and yeast strains previously isolated from zimbabwean naturally fermented milk (nfm) was studied. the lab starter cultures used were lactococcus  lactis subsp. lactis biovar. diacetylactis c1 alone (c1) or in combination with candida kefyr 23 (c1/23), l. lactis subsp. lactis lc261 alone (lc261) or in combination with c. kefyr 23 (lc261/23). the growth of the same pathogens in milk fermented with a commercial dl culture (ch-n 22) and spontaneously fermented raw  milk was also monitored. the c1 and c1/23 cultures significantly (p<0.05) inhibited the growth of both pathogens. when inoculated at the beginning of the fermentation, both e. coli 3339 and s. enteritidis 949575 counts were significantly (p<0.05) reduced by about two log cycles in c1 and c1/23 cultured milk. however, in naturally fermented milk and the dl cultured milk, both e. coli 3339 and s. enteritidis 949575 grew and reached high populations of about 9 and 8.8 log cfu ml(-1), respectively, after 18 h. when e. coli 3339 was inoculated into previously fermented milk, the viable counts were significantly (p<0.05) reduced in the presence of c1 and c1/23 from 7 log cfu ml(-1) to 3 log cfu ml(-1) after 48 h. s. enteritidis 949575 could not be recovered from these cultures after 48 h. the addition of the yeast did not enhance or diminish the inhibitory  capacity of the lab cultures. the pathogens survived in high numbers when inoculated into pre-fermented nfm and the commercial dl- (ch-n 22) cultured milk. the c1 strain, therefore, offered the best protection against the pathogens. its  inhibitory effect was mainly related to fast acid production.

TI  == drug-lipid a interactions on the escherichia coli abc transporter msba.
AB  == msba is an essential atp-binding cassette half-transporter in the cytoplasmic membrane of the gram-negative escherichia coli and is required for the export of  lipopolysaccharides (lps) to the outer membrane, most likely by transporting the  lipid a core moiety. consistent with the homology of msba to the multidrug transporter lmra in the gram-positive lactococcus lactis, our recent work in e. coli suggested that msba might interact with multiple drugs. to enable a more detailed analysis of multidrug transport by msba in an environment deficient in lps, we functionally expressed msba in l. lactis. msba expression conferred an 86-fold increase in resistance to the macrolide erythromycin. a kinetic characterization of msba-mediated ethidium and hoechst 33342 transport revealed apparent single-site kinetics and competitive inhibition of these transport reactions by vinblastine with k(i) values of 16 and 11 microm, respectively. we also detected a simple noncompetitive inhibition of hoechst 33342 transport by free lipid a with a k(i) of 57 microm, in a similar range as the k(i) for vinblastine, underscoring the relevance of our lps-less lactococcal model for studies on msba-mediated drug transport. these observations demonstrate the ability of heterologously expressed msba to interact with free lipid a and multiple drugs in the absence of auxiliary e. coli proteins. our transport data provide further functional support for direct lps-msba interactions as observed in a recent crystal structure for msba from salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (c. l. reyes and g. chang, science 308:1028-1031, 2005).

TI  == isolation, identification, and selection of lactic acid bacteria from alfalfa sprouts for competitive inhibition of foodborne pathogens.
AB  == several studies have investigated the control of pathogens on alfalfa sprouts, and some treatments have been shown to be effective in reducing pathogen populations. however, control methods investigated thus far only provide pathogen control at a given point in the sprouting process and can affect germination. competitive inhibition of pathogens with lactic acid bacteria might provide pathogen control throughout the sprouting process and up to consumption. the purpose of this study was to isolate and identify lactic acid bacteria from alfalfa sprouts to inhibit the growth of foodborne pathogens. fifty-eight lactic  acid bacteria isolates were obtained from alfalfa seeds and sprouts. these isolates were evaluated for inhibitory action against salmonella enterica, escherichia coli o157:h7, and listeria monocytogenes by agar spot tests. all pathogens were inhibited by 32 (55%) of the isolates, s. enterica by 56 (97%), e. coli o157:h7 by 49 (84%), and l. monocytogenes by 41 (71%). the isolates were identified by the analytical profile index evaluation of carbohydrate utilization. isolates obtained from a sample of alfalfa seeds and identified as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis showed zones of inhibition of 4.0 mm or greater  for all pathogens. one of these isolates, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (l7),  and an isolate previously obtained, pediococcus acidilactici (d3), were evaluated for competitive inhibition of s. enterica, e. coli o157:h7, and l. monocytogenes  in deman rogosa sharpe agar and broth. pathogen populations were significantly reduced by day 5. the selected isolates will be further evaluated in future studies for inhibitory action toward s. enterica, e. coli o157:h7, and l. monocytogenes during sprouting.

TI  == deciphering the function of an orf: salmonella enterica deom protein is a new mutarotase specific for deoxyribose.
AB  == we identified in salmonella enterica serovar typhi a cluster of four genes encoding a deoxyribokinase (deok), a putative permease (deop), a repressor (deoq), and an open reading frame encoding a 337 amino acid residues protein of unknown function. we show that the latter protein, called deom, is a hexamer whose synthesis is increased by a factor over 5 after induction with deoxyribose. the cd spectrum of the purified recombinant protein indicated a dominant contribution of betatype secondary structure and a small content of alpha-helix.  temperature and guanidinium hydrochloride induced denaturation of deom indicated  that the hexamer dissociation and monomer unfolding are coupled processes. deom exhibits 12.5% and 15% sequence identity with galactose mutarotase from lactococcus lactis and respectively escherichia coli, which suggested that these  three proteins share similar functions. polarimetric experiments demonstrated that deom is a mutarotase with high specificity for deoxyribose. site-directed mutagenesis of his183 in deom, corresponding to a catalytically active residue in galm, yielded an almost inactive deoxyribose mutarotase. deom was crystallized and diffraction data collected for two crystal systems, confirmed its hexameric state. the possible role of the protein and of the entire gene cluster is discussed in connection with the energy metabolism of s. enterica under particular growth conditions.

TI  == m1 protein triggers a phosphoinositide cascade for group a streptococcus invasion of epithelial cells.
AB  == invasion of nonphagocytic cells by bacteria provides a favorable niche for persistence and evasion of host defenses and antibiotics. m protein is a major virulence factor because it promotes high-frequency invasion of epithelial cells  by group a streptococcus (gas) and also renders the bacterium resistant to phagocytosis. in this study, we investigated the role of m1 protein from serotype m1 strain 90-226 in regulating mammalian signal transduction and cytoskeletal rearrangement for bacterial entry. ly294002 and wortmannin, which are inhibitors  of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi 3-k) blocked invasion of epithelial cells by gas by 75 and 80%, respectively, but failed to inhibit invasion by salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. also, epithelial cells transiently transfected with dominant negative p85 and p110 genes, the regulatory and catalytic subunits of pi 3-k, respectively, were less able to be invaded by gas. to separate the influence of other streptococcal virulence factors from m protein, lactococcus lactis was engineered to express m1 protein on its surface. l. lactis(plm1) invaded epithelial cells efficiently in vitro, and pi 3-k inhibitors blocked 90% of this  invasion. purified soluble m1 protein stimulated the formation of stress fibers and actin tuffs on epithelial cells. ly294002 and wortmannin inhibited these cellular changes. a phosphoinositide analogue also inhibited the invasion of epithelial cells by gas. therefore, m1 protein, either directly or via bound fibronectin, initiates signals that depend on the lipid kinase pi 3-k pathway, which paves the way for cytoskeletal rearrangement that internalize the bacterium.

TI  == an in vitro assay to evaluate competitive exclusion products for poultry.
AB  == an in vitro assay was developed to measure the ability of competitive exclusion (ce) bacteria to protect caco-2 and crl-2117 epithelial cells from invasion by salmonella typhimurium. the proposed assay is needed to expedite the development  of defined-flora ce products. the average significantly protective concentration  of the commercial poultry-specific ce product preempt was 4.05 log cfu/6.41 log human caco-2 cells and 3.71 log cfu/6.89 log cfu chicken crl-2117 cells, enterococcus faecalis isolated from preempt protected crl-2117 cells, escherichia coli isolates protected caco-2 cells, lactococcus lactis and bacteroides distasonis isolates protected both cell lines, and three species of lactobacillus isolates failed to protect either cell line. a defined mixture of 29 strains of bacteria similar to the constituents of preempt protected both cell lines from salmonella invasion at a concentration of 7.83 log cfu. the constituents of the defined ce culture were separated into mixtures of obligate (8.42 log cfu) and facultative (8.49 log cfu) anaerobes, which both protected the cell lines, suggesting that both types of bacteria were equally protective. although not a substitute for in vivo testing, the in vitro ce assay is a rapid technique for the evaluation of bacterial mixtures for potential ce products.

AB  == nisin is an antimicrobial peptide produced by the food-grade microorganism lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis. this peptide inhibits many gram-positive bacteria, and when combined with chelating agents it inhibits gram-negative bacteria such as salmonella sp. the efficacy of packaging films treated with nisin-containing formulations to reduce salmonella contamination of fresh broiler drumstick skin and increase the refrigerated shelf life was investigated. three films (5.1 cm2) of varying hydrophobicities (polyvinyl chloride [pvc], linear low density polyethylene, nylon) were coated with one of three liquid formulations (ph 3.5 to 3.8) composed of 100 microg/ml nisin and varying concentrations of citric acid, edta, and tween 80. the treated films were applied either wet or dry to 5.1-cm2 broiler drumstick skin samples inoculated with a nalidixic acid-resistant (nar) strain of salmonella typhimurium. after incubation at 4 degrees c for 24 h the populations of surviving salmonella typhimuriumnar organisms were recovered from the skin and film samples using a rinse procedure and enumerated on brain heart infusion agar containing 800 ppm na. log reductions (untreated versus treated skin) in salmonella typhimuriumnar populations ranged from 0.4 to 2.1. treatment formulation compositions and wet versus dry treatment  application also influenced the extent of kill. the shelf life of refrigerated broiler drumsticks was extended by 0.6 to 2.2 days following a 3-min immersion in a nisin-containing treatment solution and subsequent storage in a foam tray pack  containing a nisin-treated pvc overwrap and a nisin-treated absorbent tray pad. these findings demonstrated that salmonella typhimurium and spoilage microorganism populations on the surface of fresh broiler skin and drumsticks can be significantly reduced using immersion treatments, absorbent tray pads, and packaging films treated with nisin-containing formulations.

TI  == modulation of humoral immune response through probiotic intake.
AB  == thirty healthy volunteers were randomised into three different treatment groups and consumed lactobacillus gg, lactococcus lactis or placebo (ethyl cellulose) for 7 days. on days 1, 3 and 5, an attenuated salmonella typhi ty21a oral vaccine was given to all subjects to mimic an enteropathogenic infection. all subjects responded well to the vaccine, but no significant differences were observed in numbers of iga-, igg- and igm-secreting cells among the different groups. there was a trend towards a greater increase in specific iga among the subjects receiving the vaccine in combination with lactobacillus gg. those receiving l. lactis with their vaccine evinced significantly higher cr3 receptor expression on neutrophils than those receiving either the placebo or lactobacillus gg. these results indicate that probiotics may influence differently the immune response to oral s. typhi vaccine and that the immunomodulatory effect of probiotics is strain-dependent.

TI  == specificity mutants of the binding protein of the oligopeptide transport system of lactococcus lactis.
AB  == the kinetic properties of wild-type and mutant oligopeptide binding proteins of lactococcus lactis were determined. to observe the properties of the mutant proteins in vivo, the oppa gene was deleted from the chromosome of l. lactis to produce a strain that was totally defective in oligopeptide transport. amplified  expression of the oppa gene resulted in an 8- to 12-fold increase in oppa protein relative to the wild-type level. the amplified expression was paralleled by increased bradykinin binding activity, but had relatively little effect on the overall transport of bradykinin via opp. several site-directed mutants were constructed on the basis of a comparison of the primary sequences of oppa from salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and l. lactis, taking into account the known structure of the serovar typhimurium protein. putative peptide binding-site residues were mutated. all the mutant oppa proteins exhibited a decreased binding affinity for the high-affinity peptide bradykinin. except for oppa(d471r), the mutant oppa proteins displayed highly defective bradykinin uptake, whereas the transport of the low-affinity substrate kygk was barely affected. cells expressing oppa(d471r) had a similar k(m) for transport, whereas the v(max) was increased more than twofold as compared to the wild-type protein. the data are discussed in the light of a kinetic model and imply that the rate of transport is determined to a large extent by the donation of the peptide from the oppa protein to the translocator complex.

TI  == effect of chelators and nisin produced in situ on inhibition and inactivation of  gram negatives.
AB  == the ability of chelators and nisin generated in situ to inhibit and inactivate e. coli and other gram negatives in a model substrate was investigated. the effect of various chelators and different concentrations of exogenous nisin on inhibition of e. coli in broth medium showed that only edta and pyrophosphates were able to cause appreciable inhibition of e. coli by nisin. in a broth where l. lactis ncfb 497 produced nisin in a concentration of 250-300 iu/ml, pyrophosphates were unable to inactivate e. coli. under the same conditions, addition of edta led to inactivation of e. coli at neutral and slightly acidic ph only. a cocktail of strains of e. coli was less sensitive than e. coli atcc 25922 alone. pseudomonas aeruginosa was more sensitive and salmonellae more resistant.  edta also caused a slight reduction in the l. lactis population and its biochemical activity as regards ph drop and acid production. some of the inhibition of e. coli could be ascribed to the physical presence of lactococcus cells rather than their metabolites excreted into the medium. failure to observe  any inhibition in fermented broths at their natural ph (4.0) was ascribed to the  poor chelating power of edta under acid conditions.

TI  == effect of elevated oxygen and carbon dioxide on the surface growth of vegetable-associated micro-organisms.
AB  == the impact of a novel type of modified atmosphere (ma), referred to as high o2-ma, on micro-organisms associated with the spoilage of minimally-processed vegetables was studied. pure cultures of pseudomonas fluorescens, enterobacter agglomerans, aureobacterium strain 27, candida guilliermondii, c. sake, salmonella typhimurium, salm. enteritidis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, leuconostoc mesenteroides var. mesenteroides, lactobacillus plantarum and lactococcus lactis were cultured on an agar-surface model system and incubated at 8 degrees c under an atmosphere composed of o2 (80 or 90%, balanced with n2), co2 (10 or 20%, balanced with n2), or a combination of both gases. in general, exposure to high o2 alone did not inhibit microbial growth strongly, while co2 alone reduced growth to some extent in most cases. consistently strong inhibition was observed only when the two gases were used in  combination. with minimally-processed vegetables, where co2 levels of around 20%  or above cannot be used because of physiological damage to the produce, the combined treatment of high o2 and 10-20% co2 may provide adequate suppression of  microbial growth, allowing a safe, prolonged shelf-life.

TI  == bactericidal action of 308 nm excimer-laser radiation: an in vitro investigation.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of 308 nm excimer-laser radiation on bacterial growth. six different bacterial strains (staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, lactococcis lactis, salmonella typhimurium, and deinococcus radiodurans) were exposed in vitro to various doses and energy densities of laser radiation. to exclude bacterial killing by supraphysiological heating, the temperature change in the samples during irradiation was measured. extended antimicrobial effects of xecl excimer-laser radiation depending on the time of radiation, the energy density of the laser beam, and the irradiated bacterial strain were observed. reduction of bacterial growth is independent of temperature and not linked to any ablative tissue removal. in almost all cases, a 99.9% reduction of bacteria was reached by total radiation times < 100 ms. the proven antimicrobial effects of 308 nm excimer-laser radiation may be of significant clinical importance in endodontics  and periodontology in the future.

TI  == characterization of escherichia coli nrdh. a glutaredoxin-like protein with a thioredoxin-like activity profile.
AB  == ribonucleotides are converted to deoxyribonucleotides by ribonucleotide reductases. either thioredoxin or glutaredoxin is a required electron donor for class i and ii enzymes. glutaredoxins are reduced by glutathione, thioredoxins by thioredoxin reductase. recently, a glutaredoxin-like protein, nrdh, was isolated  as the functional electron donor for a nrdef ribonucleotide reductase, a class ib enzyme, from lactococcus lactis. the absence of glutathione in this bacterium raised the question of the identity of the intracellular reductant for nrdh. homologues of nrdh are present in the genomes of escherichia coli and salmonella  typhimurium, upstream of the genes for the poorly transcribed nrdef, separated from it by an open reading frame (nrdi) coding for a protein of unknown function. overexpression of e. coli nrdh protein shows that it is a functional hydrogen donor with higher specificity for the class ib (nrdef) than for the class ia (nrdab) ribonucleotide reductase. furthermore, this glutaredoxin-like enzyme is reduced by thioredoxin reductase and not by glutathione. we suggest that several  uncharacterized glutaredoxin-like proteins present in the genomes of organisms lacking gsh, including archae, will also react with thioredoxin reductase and be  related to the ancestors from which the gsh-dependent glutaredoxins have evolved  by the acquisition of a gsh-binding site. we also show that nrdi, encoded by all  nrdef operons, has a stimulatory effect on ribonucleotide reduction.

TI  == application of direct-fed microbial bacteria and fructooligosaccharides for salmonella control in broilers during feed withdrawal.
AB  == providing direct-fed-microbial (dfm) bacteria and fructooligosaccharides (fos) for the control of potential escalation of salmonella colonization during simulated feed withdrawal and confinement was assessed. eight hundred and eighty  broilers (16 pens; 55 chicks per pen) were reared to 6 wk of age. chicks were sprayed with a solution containing 10(6) nalidixic-acid resistant salmonella typhimuriumnr cells per milliliter on the 2nd d after hatching. because this first challenge did not yield a high infection rate, chickens were rechallenged per os at day 18 by providing water containing 10(7) cells of s. typhimuriumnr per milliliter. at 3 and 5 wk of age, 10 birds per pen were euthanatized and cecal salmonella were quantified (log colony-forming units per gram). feed was removed from all pens at 6 wk, and pens were randomly assigned to be either the treatment group or the control group. the treatment groups were provided a dfm (mixture of nine bacteria) and fos 50 (r) (10%) in the drinking water. the control groups received drinking water only. after 6 h of feed withdrawal, chickens were cooped (eight per coop) and held 10 h. immediately after confinement, 10 chickens were used for cecal enumeration of s. typhimuriumnr. salmonella colonization declined from 99% at 3 wk to 44% at 5 wk. after feed withdrawal, application of the treatment, and confinement, 11 and 14% of the treated and control groups, respectively, yielded s. typhimuriumnr by direct plating from ceca (3.87 and 3.75 log 10 cfu/g, respectively). no difference (p >  0.05) in salmonella colonization occurred between the treated and the control groups; however, enrichment of ceca (incubation in nutrient broth at 37 c for 24  h) yielded a higher incidence of s. typhimuriumnr in the control groups (32% in the treated vs 51% in the control). ceca weights were greater in the treated group (p < 0.05). simulated feed withdrawal and confinement did not escalate salmonella colonization in the chicken ceca.

TI  == [isolation and reassociation of acetogen and methanogen in a syntrophobic coculture degrading butyrate anaerobically].
AB  == anaerobic coculture bf2 which degraded butyrate into acetate and produced methane was isolated from granular methanogenic sludge. the coculture is associated syntrophically the syntrophomonas subsp. saponavida strain cf2 with methanobacterium formicicum strain mf2 and appeared to degraded c4 approximately  c18 fatty acids including isobutyrate. the optimal temperature and ph for growth  was 37 degrees c and 7.7 respectively. the strain cf2 was obtained in pure culture with crotonate as substrate and produces acetate and butyrate. the doubling time of strain cf2 in crotonate media was about 20 hours. strain cf2 is  gram negative, slightly curved 0.2 approximately 0.3 x 2.0 approximately 3.0 micron with round ends, motile by lateral flagellation at the concave side, non sporeforming. with a hydrogen scavenging organism, such as methanospillum hungatei jf1, methanobacterium formicicum 1535, methanobrevibacterium bryantii 1125 and desulfovibrio sp. b11, the strain cf2 paired up and the defined coculture degraded butyrate to acetate. when the strain cf2 associated with the original accompanist, methanobacterium formicius strain mf2, the reassociated couculture degraded butyrate to acetate and produced methane again.

TI  == tripeptidase gene (pept) of lactococcus lactis: molecular cloning and nucleotide  sequencing of pept and construction of a chromosomal deletion mutant.
AB  == the gene encoding a tripeptidase (pept) of lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris (formerly subsp. lactis) mg1363 was cloned from a genomic library in puc19 and subsequently sequenced. the tripeptidase of l. lactis was shown to be homologous  to pept of salmonella typhimurium with 47.4% identity in the deduced amino acid sequences. l. lactis pept was enzymatically active in escherichia coli and allowed growth of a peptidase-negative leucine-auxotrophic e. coli strain by liberation of leu from a tripeptide. using a two-step integration-excision system, a pept-negative mutant of l. lactis was constructed. no differences between the growth of the mutant and that of the wild-type strain in milk or in chemically defined medium with casein as the sole source of essential amino acids were observed.

TI  == effect of a defined continuous-flow derived bacterial culture and dietary lactose on salmonella typhimurium colonization in broiler chickens.
AB  == a defined bacterial culture protective against salmonella typhimurium cecal colonization in broiler chicks was derived utilizing a continuous-flow (cf) culture apparatus. chicks receiving the cf culture in combination with a diet containing dietary lactose were protected against cecal colonization by s. typhimurium. the culture consisted of a mixture of gram-positive and gram-negative facultative and strictly anaerobic bacteria. the isolates were identified as enterococcus avium, two strains of enterococcus faecalis (designated a and b), lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus animalis, a lactobacillus that could not be identified to species level (designated strain cms), citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli, e. fergusonii, bifidobacterium animals, and propionibacterium acidipropionici. results indicated that cf cultures can be  used as a tool to identify bacteria which are antagonistic to s. typhimurium in the chick cecum.

TI  == inhibition of clostridium tyrobutyricum by bacteriocin-like substances produced by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria were selected for their inhibitory activity against clostridium tyrobutyricum under conditions that eliminate the effects of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide. four strains were isolated belonging to the species lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. the sensitivity of the inhibitory substances to pronase and trypsine indicates that they are proteins or peptides different from  nisin. their resistance to phospholipase d indicates that they are also different from lactostrepcin. the inhibitory substances are produced during the exponential phase of growth. their activity is bactericidal and directed toward some strains  of clostridium tyrobutyricum, lactobacillus helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus, but strains used as dairy starters, lactobacillus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, and propionibacterium shermanii, are not all affected by the inhibition.
