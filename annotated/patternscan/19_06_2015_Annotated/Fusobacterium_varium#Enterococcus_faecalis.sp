TI  == a simulation of microbial competition in the human colonic ecosystem.
AB  == many investigations of the interactions of microbial competitors in the gastrointestinal tract used continuous-flow anaerobic cultures. the simulation reported here was a deterministic 11-compartment model coded by using the c programming language and based on parameters from published in vitro studies and  assumptions were data were unavailable. the resource compartments were glucose, lactose and sucrose, starch, sorbose, and serine. six microbial competitors included indigenous nonpathogenic colonizers of the human gastrointestinal tract  (escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, bacteroids ovatus, fusobacterium varium, and enterococcus faecalis) and the potential human enteropathogen salmonella typhimurium. flows of carbon from the resources to the microbes were modified by resource and space controls. partitioning of resources to the competitors that could utilize them was calculated at each iteration on the basis of availability of all resources by feeding preference functions. resources did not accumulate during iterations of the model. the results of the computer simulation of microbial competition model and for various modifications of the model. the results were based on few measured parameters but may be useful in the design of user-friendly software to aid researchers in defining and manipulating  the microbial ecology of colonic ecosystems as relates to food-borne disease.

TI  == selected faecal bacteria and nutrients essential for antagonism of salmonella typhimurium in anaerobic continuous flow cultures.
AB  == as few as five of the species of bacteria commonly found in human faeces--escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides ovatus and fusobacterium varium--when grown together in anaerobic continuous flow cultures exerted antagonistic effects on salmonella typhimurium as great as those given by mixed bacteria from extracts of human faeces. in a single culture, the population of s. typhimurium was c. 10(8) cfu/ml but in mixed cultures with the five antagonistic bacteria or mixed faecal bacteria it was reduced to c. 10(3) cfu/ml. antagonism appeared to be the result of competition for the growth limiting amino acids, arginine, serine, threonine and aspartic acid. optimal manifestation of antagonism required the presence of carbon sources fermentable only by antagonistic bacteria, such as lactose 0.1%, w/v, sucrose 0.1% (w/v) and starch 0.2-0.3% w/v. these carbohydrates promoted the growth of the antagonistic bacteria, particularly e. coli and b. ovatus. however, an increase in concentration by several fold of any one of four growth-limiting amino acids in the medium diminished the antagonistic effects and the population  of s. typhimurium rose 10(2)-10(3)-fold.

TI  == the role of escherichia coli haemolysin in the pathogenic synergy of colonic bacteria in subcutaneous abscess formation in mice.
AB  == the growth of nine species of colonic bacteria--escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides ovatus, fusobacterium varium, clostridium perfringens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus and bifidobacterium adolescentis--was examined after concomitant injection to form experimental subcutaneous abscesses in mice. injection of a mixture of c. 10(5) cfu of each of the first five strains (e. coli, ent. faecalis, b. ovatis, f. varium and c. perfringens) resulted in abscess formation in all mice tested when  the e. coli strain was haemolytic. e. coli and b. ovatus multiplied and reached a maximum population of c. 10(8) cfu/abscess. when non-haemolytic e. coli was used, injection of greater than or equal to 10(7) cfu was required for abscess formation. the inclusion of partially purified e. coli haemolysin (125 hu50) with c. 10(5) cfu of bacteria including non-haemolytic e. coli resulted in abscess formation in most mice tested. these results indicate that e. coli haemolysin is  one factor that may potentiate pathogenic synergy among colonic bacteria especially between e. coli and b. ovatus, during abscess formation.

TI  == potent antagonism of escherichia coli, bacteroides ovatus, fusobacterium varium,  and enterococcus faecalis, alone or in combination, for enteropathogens in anaerobic continuous flow cultures.
AB  == interactions between representative strains of four predominant resident bacteria of the human colon, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides ovatus,  and fusobacterium varium, and strains of seven enteropathogens, yersinia enterocolitica, shigella flexneri, salmonella typhimurium, vibrio parahaemolyticus, v. cholerae serogroup non o1, staphylococcus aureus, and clostridium perfringens, were examined in studies with an anaerobic continuous flow culture system and medium resembling the content of the mouse caecum (mcm).  potent unilateral antagonism attributable to synergic activities of the resident  bacteria against the enteropathogens was evident. the four resident bacteria persisted at levels of c. 10(6) cfu/ml or more in single and in any mixed cultures of the resident species. the seven enteropathogens also persisted in single cultures. in contrast, y. enterocolitica was excluded in several days in mixed cultures with each of the four resident bacteria. sh. flexneri and staph. aureus were excluded in the presence of e. coli alone. c. perfringens, v. parahaemolyticus and v. cholerae serogroup non o1 were excluded in the presence of e. coli with b. ovatus and, in some cases, with additional species. s. typhimurium was the most resistant; only c. 10(2)-fold reduction of the population level was observed in mixed culture with all four of the resident species. when the amounts of some components in the medium, such as peptone and yeast extract, were increased, c. perfringens grew and persisted even in the presence of the four resident bacteria. sh. flexneri, in contrast decreased steadily, even in enriched media.

TI  == microbial synergy in experimental intra-abdominal abscess.
AB  == intra-abdominal sepsis was studied in wistar rats by using four microbial species: escherichia coli, enterococci, bacteroides fragilis, and fusobacterium varium. these organisms were implanted into the peritoneal cavity singly and in all possible dual combinations. results were evaluated by mortality rates and the incidence of intra-abdominal abscesses on autopsy following sacrifice after 7 days. mortality was restricted to recipients of e. coli, thus implicating coliforms in the acute lethality associated with this experimental model. intra-abdominal abscesses were produced in 61 of 95 (94%) animals that received the combination of an anaerobe and a facultative organism. abscesses failed to form with any single strain or with e. coli plus enterococci, and they were detected in one 1 of 19 animals receiving b. fragilis plus f. varium. these results suggest that intra-abdominal abscess formation is related to synergy between anaerobes and facultative bacteria.
