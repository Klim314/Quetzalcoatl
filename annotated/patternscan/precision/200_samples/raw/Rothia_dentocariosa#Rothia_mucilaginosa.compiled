TI  - Anti-biofilm and antibacterial activities of zinc oxide nanoparticles against the oral opportunistic pathogens Rothia dentocariosa and Rothia mucilaginosa.
AB  - Species of the genus Rothia that inhabit the oral cavity have recently been implicated in a number of diseases. To minimize their role in oral infections, it is imperative to reduce and/or control the growth and biofilm formation activity of Rothia spp. In this study, two bacterial isolates, Ora-7 and Ora-16, were obtained from the oral cavity of a healthy male subject and identified as Rothia dentocariosa and Rothia mucilaginosa, respectively, using a polyphasic taxonomic approach. Antimicrobial and anti-biofilm formation activities of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs), of average size 35 nm, were assessed in in vitro assays using Crystal Violet and live and dead staining techniques. The ZnO-NPs exhibited an IC50 value of 53 and 76 mug ml(-1) against R. dentocariosa and R. mucilaginosa, respectively. Biofilm-formation assays, performed on the surfaces of polystyrene plates, artificial teeth, and dental prostheses, revealed the efficacy of ZnO-NPs as a potential antibacterial agent for controlling the growth of Rothia isolates in both planktonic form and biofilm.
TI  - A novel selective medium for the isolation and distribution of Rothia dentocariosa in oral cavities.
AB  - Rothia dentocariosa is an indigenous microbial flora of dental plaque. To examine the bacterium population in oral cavities, a novel selective medium, designated RDSM, was developed for the isolation of R. dentocariosa. RDSM was prepared by adding 0.5 mug/ml of lincomycin, 10 mug/ml of colistin, and 40% sucrose to Heart Infusion (HI). Average growth recovery of R. dentocariosa on RDSM was 93.8% that of HI medium. Growth of other bacteria including Rothia mucilaginosa, Neisseria, Actinomyces, or streptococci was remarkably inhibited on the selective medium. Clinical efficacy was evaluated by the recovery of R. dentocariosa on RDSM from the stimulated saliva samples of 8 volunteers. R. dentocariosa was detected at 2.6 (range: 1.0-4.6) % to total bacteria of 8.0x10(7)CFU/ml on BHI in their oral cavities. The new selective medium, RDSM, was highly selective for R. dentocariosa and was useful for the isolation of R. dentocariosa from clinical samples.
TI  - Comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (RP) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (GRs = good responders) or periodontal health (PH) using the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM). METHODS: At baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with PH and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by HOMIM. The subjects with periodontitis were classified as having RP (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (AL) and/or more than three sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as GRs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after treatment. Significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the Kruskal-Wallis and chi(2) tests. RESULTS: More species were detected in patients with disease (GR or RP) than in those without disease (PH). Subjects with RP were distinguished from GRs or those with PH by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Campylobacter gracilis, Eubacterium nodatum, Selenomonas noxia, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., Treponema spp., and Eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, TM7 spp. oral taxon [OT] 346/356, Bacteroidetes sp. OT 272/274, Solobacterium moorei, Desulfobulbus sp. OT 041, Brevundimonas diminuta, Sphaerocytophaga sp. OT 337, Shuttleworthia satelles, Filifactor alocis, Dialister invisus/pneumosintes, Granulicatella adiacens, Mogibacterium timidum, Veillonella atypica, Mycoplasma salivarium, Synergistes sp. cluster II, and Acidaminococcaceae [G-1] sp. OT 132/150/155/148/135) (P <0.05). Species that were more prevalent in subjects with PH than in patients with periodontitis included Actinomyces sp. OT 170, Actinomyces spp. cluster I, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Cardiobacterium hominis, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Lautropia mirabilis, Propionibacterium propionicum, Rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and Streptococcus sanguinis (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: As determined by HOMIM, patients with RP presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the GR and PH groups.
TI  - Evaluation of bacterial nitrate reduction in the human oral cavity.
AB  - It is hypothesized that the enterosalivary nitrate circulation encourages nitrate reducing bacteria to reside within the oral cavity. Nitrite production may then limit the growth of acidogenic bacteria as a result of the production of antimicrobial oxides of nitrogen, including nitric oxide. This study was carried out with 10 subjects to characterize oral nitrate reduction and identify the bacteria responsible. Nitrate reduction varied between individuals (mean 85.4 +/- 15.9 nmol nitrite min(-1) with 10 ml 1 mm KNO(3) mouth wash) and was found to be concentrated at the rear of the tongue dorsal surface. Nitrate reductase positive isolates identified, using 16S rDNA sequencing, from the tongue comprised Veillonella atypica (34%), Veillonella dispar (24%), Actinomyces odontolyticus (21%), Actinomyces naeslundii (2%), Rothia mucilaginosa (10%), Rothia dentocariosa (3%) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (5%). Nitrite production rates, using intact and permeabilized cells, of the major tongue nitrate reducers were determined in the presence of methyl and benzyl viologen. Under anaerobic conditions in the presence of nitrate, rates in decreasing order were: A. odontolyticus > R. mucilaginosa > R. dentocariosa > V. dispar > V. atypica. In conclusion, Veillonella spp. were found to be the most prevalent taxa isolated and thus may make a major contribution to nitrate reduction in the oral cavity.
TI  - Structural and serological characterization of the major glycolipid from Rothia mucilaginosa.
AB  - Structural studies on the major glycolipid isolated from Rothia mucilaginosa were carried out utilising specific chemical degradation, NMR spectroscopy and matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI TOF-MS). The glycolipid was found to be a dimannosylacylmonoglyceride in which the carbohydrate part was the glycerol-linked dimannoside alpha-D-Manp-(1-->3)-alpha-D-Manp-(1-->3)-sn-Gro (Man A-Man B-Gro), of which Man B was esterified at O-6 by a fatty acid residue. A second fatty acid substituted the secondary methylene position of the glycerol residue, in contrast to the glycolipid previously found in R. dentocariosa and Saccharopolyspora strains, in which the second fatty acid esterified the primary methylene position of glycerol. Results of the ELISA experiment with rabbit specific antibacterial sera indicate that these two major glycolipids are antigenic, and the patterns of serological reactivity are similar but not identical.
TI  - Identification of some charcoal-black-pigmented CDC fermentative coryneform group 4 isolates as Rothia dentocariosa and some as Corynebacterium aurimucosum: proposal of Rothia dentocariosa emend. Georg and Brown 1967, Corynebacterium aurimucosum emend. Yassin et al. 2002, and Corynebacterium nigricans Shukla et al. 2003 pro synon. Corynebacterium aurimucosum.
AB  - Sixty-three clinical isolates of charcoal-black-pigmented, gram-positive coryneform rods were received for identification by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and were provisionally designated CDC fermentative coryneform group 4 (FCG4). Forty-five of these were characterized by morphological, physiologic, antimicrobial susceptibility, cellular fatty acids, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and DNA-DNA hybridization analyses. Nitrate reduction, cellular fatty acid analysis, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and DNA-DNA hybridization studies segregated these strains into two groups: FCG4a (8 strains) and FCG4b (37 strains). The FCG4a strains, only one of which was from a female genitourinary source, produced cellular fatty acid and biochemical profiles similar to those observed with reference strains of Rothia dentocariosa and Rothia mucilaginosa, while the FCG4b strains were similar to Corynebacterium species. DNA-DNA hybridization analysis demonstrated species-level relatedness among six FCG4a tested strains and showed that they were a charcoal-black-pigmented variant of R. dentocariosa. Sixteen isolates of the FCG4b group, mainly from female genitourinary tract specimens, as well as the type strains of two recently named species, Corynebacterium aurimucosum and Corynebacterium nigricans, were shown by DNA-DNA hybridization analysis and the sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to be related at the species level and unrelated to the type strain of R. dentocariosa; therefore, the Corynebacterium-like strains were classified as a charcoal-black-pigmented variant of C. aurimucosum, because this name has nomenclatural priority over C. nigricans. These findings indicate that FCG4 represents a heterogeneous group that contains pigmented variants of both R. dentocariosa and C. aurimucosum; hence, the descriptions of both R. dentocariosa and C. aurimucosum have been amended to include charcoal-black-pigmented variants, and C. nigricans is a pro synonym of C. aurimucosum.
TI  - Rothia aeria sp. nov., Rhodococcus baikonurensis sp. nov. and Arthrobacter russicus sp. nov., isolated from air in the Russian space laboratory Mir.
AB  - Four Gram-positive bacteria, strains A1-17B(T), A1-22(T), A1-3(T) and A1-8, isolated from the air in the Russian space laboratory Mir, were subjected to a polyphasic taxonomic study. Phylogenetic analysis of the bacteria based on their 16S rDNA sequence showed that they belong to the genera Rothia (A1-17B(T)), Rhodococcus (A1-22(T)) and Arthrobacter (A1-3(T) and A1-8). Morphological, physiological, chemotaxonomic and genomic characteristics supported the assignments of these strains to these genera, but they could not be classified as any existing species within each respective genus. 16S rDNA similarity values between strain A1-17B(T) and its neighbours, Rothia dentocariosa genomovar II, Rothia dentocariosa, Rothia mucilaginosa and Rothia nasimurium, were respectively 99.8, 98.0, 96.4 and 95.4 %. Polyphasic taxonomic evidence indicated that strain A1-17B(T) should be categorized together with the unofficially named Rothia dentocariosa genomovar II, but clearly differentiated them from the established species of the genus ROTHIA: Strain A1-22(T) formed a coherent cluster with Rhodococcus erythropolis, Rhodococcus globerulus, Rhodococcus marinonascens and Rhodococcus percolatus in 16S rDNA sequence analysis, but DNA-DNA relatedness values were only 45.5, 35.3, 18.9 and 21.9 %. Strains A1-3(T) and A1-8 shared 99.9 % 16S rDNA sequence similarity, and strain A1-3(T) showed the highest level of 16S rDNA similarity, 96.6 %, to Arthrobacter polychromogenes. Contrasting biochemical characteristics were also identified. Finally, as a result of the polyphasic taxonomic study, three of the strains are proposed as type strains of novel species: Rothia aeria sp. nov. (A1-17B(T)=GTC 867(T)=JCM 11412(T)=DSM 14556(T)), Rhodococcus baikonurensis sp. nov. (A1-22(T)=GTC 1041(T)=JCM 11411(T)=DSM 44587(T)) and Arthrobacter russicus sp. nov. (A1-3(T)=GTC 863(T)=JCM 11414(T)=DSM 14555(T)).
TI  - Characterization of a Rothia-like organism from a mouse: description of Rothia nasimurium sp. nov. and reclassification of Stomatococcus mucilaginosus as Rothia mucilaginosa comb. nov.
AB  - An unknown, Gram-positive, ovoid-shaped bacterium isolated from the nose of a mouse was subjected to a polyphasic taxonomic analysis. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing demonstrated that the unknown organism was a member of the family Micrococcaceae and possessed a specific phylogenetic association with Rothia dentocariosa and Stomatococcus mucilaginosus. Phenotypically, the bacterium closely resembled R. dentocariosa and S. mucilaginosus but could be distinguished from these species by biochemical tests and electrophoretic analysis of whole-cell proteins. Based on both phylogenetic and phenotypic evidence, it is proposed that the unknown bacterium be classified in the genus Rothia, as Rothia nasimurium sp. nov. In addition, it is proposed that S. mucilaginosus be reclassified in the genus Rothia, as Rothia mucilaginosa comb. nov.
