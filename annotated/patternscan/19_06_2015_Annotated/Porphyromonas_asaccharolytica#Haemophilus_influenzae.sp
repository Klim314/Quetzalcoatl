TI  == bacteriology of chronic maxillary sinusitis associated with nasal polyposis.
AB  == aspirates from 48 chronically inflamed maxillary sinuses from patients who had nasal polyposis were processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. bacterial growth was present in 46 (96%) specimens. aerobic or facultative bacteria were present in 6 (13%) specimens, anaerobic bacteria alone in 18 (39%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 22 (48%). there were 110 bacterial isolates (2.4 per specimen). thirty-nine of the isolates were aerobic or facultative organisms (0.85 per specimen). the predominant aerobic or facultative organisms were: staphylococcus aureus, microaerophilic streptococci, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis. seventy-one anaerobes were isolated (1.5 per specimen), peptostreptococcus spp., prevotella spp., porphyromonas asaccharolytica and fusobacterium spp. being predominant. these findings illustrate for the first time the presence of polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora in patients with chronic maxillary sinusitis who had nasal polyposis.
