TI  - Alternative fecal indicators and their empirical relationships with enteric viruses, Salmonella enterica, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in surface waters of a tropical urban catchment.
AB  - The suitability of traditional microbial indicators (i.e., Escherichia coli and enterococci) has been challenged due to the lack of correlation with pathogens and evidence of possible regrowth in the natural environment. In this study, the relationships between alternative microbial indicators of potential human fecal contamination (Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Methanobrevibacter smithii, human polyomaviruses [HPyVs], and F+ and somatic coliphages) and pathogens (Salmonella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, rotavirus, astrovirus, norovirus GI, norovirus GII, and adenovirus) were compared with those of traditional microbial indicators, as well as environmental parameters (temperature, conductivity, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen, total organic carbon, total suspended solids, turbidity, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus). Water samples were collected from surface waters of urban catchments in Singapore. Salmonella and P. aeruginosa had significant positive correlations with most of the microbial indicators, especially E. coli and enterococci. Norovirus GII showed moderately strong positive correlations with most of the microbial indicators, except for HPyVs and coliphages. In general, high geometric means and significant correlations between human-specific markers and pathogens suggest the possibility of sewage contamination in some areas. The simultaneous detection of human-specific markers (i.e., B. thetaiotaomicron, M. smithii, and HPyVs) with E. coli and enterococcus supports the likelihood of recent fecal contamination, since the human-specific markers are unable to regrow in natural surface waters. Multiple-linear-regression results further confirm that the inclusion of M. smithii and HPyVs, together with traditional indicators, would better predict the occurrence of pathogens. Further study is needed to determine the applicability of such models to different geographical locations and environmental conditions.
TI  - Abnormal weight gain and gut microbiota modifications are side effects of long-term doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine treatment.
AB  - Doxycycline has been proposed for the treatment of malnourished children in developing countries, and its use has been associated with weight gain in healthy volunteers. No previous studies have assessed abnormal weight gain as a putative side effect of long-term doxycycline treatment; thus, the objective of the present study was to characterize this phenomenon. We also analyzed the role of the gut microbiota in this effect. We assessed changes in the body mass index in Q fever endocarditis patients treated with doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine and healthy individuals with no antibiotic treatment. Abnormal weight gain was defined as a gain in weight above that of the controls. The fecal samples were examined using molecular assays for Methanobrevibacter smithii, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus, Lactobacillus reuteri, and total bacterial concentrations. We examined 82 patients, including 48 patients with Q fever endocarditis and 34 controls. Approximately 23% of the treated patients showed abnormal weight gain (P = 0.001). Patients treated with doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine presented significantly lower concentrations of Bacteroidetes (P = 0.002), Firmicutes (P = 0.01), and Lactobacillus (P = 0.02). The linear regression analysis revealed that the duration of treatment was significantly associated with a decrease in Bacteroidetes (P = 0.0001), Firmicutes (P = 0.002), and total bacteria (P < 0.00001). Abnormal weight gain is a side effect of long-term doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine treatment. Gut microbiota modifications at the phylum level could play an instrumental role in this effect. We highlight the need for specific nutritional care in patients undergoing long-term antibiotic treatment, particularly treatment involving the use of doxycycline.
TI  - Lactobacillus reuteri and Escherichia coli in the human gut microbiota may predict weight gain associated with vancomycin treatment.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotics, used for 60 years to promote weight gain in animals, have been linked to obesity in adults and in children when administered during early infancy. Lactobacillus reuteri has been linked to obesity and weight gain in children affected with Kwashiorkor using ready-to-use therapeutic food. In contrast, Escherichia coli has been linked with the absence of obesity. Both of these bacteria are resistant to vancomycin. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: We assessed vancomycin-associated weight and gut microbiota changes, and tested whether bacterial species previously linked with body mass index (BMI) predict weight gain at 1 year. All endocarditis patients treated with vancomycin or amoxicillin in our center were included from January 2008 to December 2010. Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Lactobacillus and Methanobrevibacter smithii were quantified using real-time PCR on samples obtained during the 4-6 weeks antibiotic regimen. L. reuteri, L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium animalis and E. coli were quantified on stool samples obtained during the first week of antibiotics. RESULTS: Of the193 patients included in the study, 102 were treated with vancomycin and 91 with amoxicillin. Vancomycin was associated with a 10% BMI increase (odds ratio (OR) 14.1; 95% confidence interval (CI; 1.03-194); P=0.047) and acquired obesity (4/41 versus 0/56, P=0.01). In patients treated with vancomycin, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Lactobacillus increased, whereas M. smithii decreased (P<0.05). The absence of E. coli was an independent predictor of weight gain (OR=10.7; 95% CI (1.4-82.0); P=0.02). Strikingly, a patient with an 18% BMI increase showed a dramatic increase of L. reuteri but no increase of E. coli. CONCLUSION: The acquired obesity observed in patients treated with vancomycin may be related to a modulation of the gut microbiota rather than a direct antibiotic effect. L. reuteri, which is resistant to vancomycin and produces broad bacteriocins, may have an instrumental role in this effect.
TI  - A DNA microarray for the versatile diagnosis of infectious diarrhea.
AB  - Several bacteria, viruses, and parasites cause diarrhea as coinfecting pathogens. We designed a DNA microarray comprising 60-bp probes spotted 194 times for the multiplex detection of 33 enteropathogenic bacteria and seven enteropathogenic viruses, and the archaeon Methanobrevibacter smithii was used as an internal positive control. Nine pathogen-free stool specimens were used as negative controls. One of these control specimens was further spiked with Salmonella enterica as a positive control. The microarray was then tested with 40 pathological stool specimens, comprising S. enterica (n = 30), Campylobacter jejuni (n = 4), pathogenic Escherichia coli (n = 2), and adenovirus (n = 4). M. smithii was detected in 47/49 (95.9%) specimens, no pathogen was detected in negative controls and S. enterica was identified in the S. enterica-spiked positive control. The overall specificity was 100% and the overall sensitivity was 97.5% because one S. enterica sample was missed by the microarray. The multiplexed detection of C. jejuni spiked into an adenovirus-positive stool sample gave positive results, with fluorescence values of 14.3 and 9.1, respectively. These data indicate that using the protocol developed in this article, the DNA array allows for the multiplexed detection of some enteropathogens in stool samples.
TI  - Correlation between body mass index and gut concentrations of Lactobacillus reuteri, Bifidobacterium animalis, Methanobrevibacter smithii and Escherichia coli.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genus and species level analysis is the best way to characterize alterations in the human gut microbiota that are associated with obesity, because the clustering of obese and lean microbiotas increases with the taxonomic depth of the analysis. Bifidobacterium genus members have been associated with a lean status, whereas different Lactobacillus species are associated both with a lean and an obese status. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: We analyzed the fecal concentrations of Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Methanobrevibacter smithii, the genus Lactobacillus, five other Lactobacillus species previously linked with lean or obese populations, Escherichia coli and Bifidobacterium animalis in 263 individuals, including 134 obese, 38 overweight, 76 lean and 15 anorexic subjects to test for the correlation between bacterial concentration and body mass index (BMI). Of these subjects, 137 were used in our previous study. FINDINGS: Firmicutes were found in >98.5%, Bacteroidetes in 67%, M. smithii in 64%, E. coli in 51%, Lactobacillus species between 17 and 25% and B. animalis in 11% of individuals. The fecal concentration of Lactobacillus reuteri was positively correlated with BMI (coefficient=0.85; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12-0.58; P=0.02) in agreement with what was reported for Lactobacillus sakei. As reported, B. animalis (coefficient=-0.84; 95% CI -1.61 to -0.07; P=0.03) and M. smithii (coefficient=-0.43, 95% CI -0.90 to 0.05; P=0.08) were negatively associated with the BMI. Unexpectedly, E. coli was found here for the first time to negatively correlate with the BMI (coefficient=-1.05; 95% CI -1.60 to -0.50; P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Our findings confirm the specificity of the obese microbiota and emphasize the correlation between the concentration of certain Lactobacillus species and obesity.
TI  - The smallest active carbamoyl phosphate synthetase was identified in the human gut archaeon Methanobrevibacter smithii.
AB  - The genome of the major intestinal archaeon Methanobrevibacter smithii contains a complex gene system coding for carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (CPSase) composed of both full-length and reduced-size synthetase subunits. These ammonia-metabolizing enzymes could play a key role in controlling ammonia assimilation in M. smithii, affecting the metabolism of gut bacterial microbiota, with an impact on host obesity. In this study, we isolated and characterized the small (41 kDa) CPSase homolog from M. smithii. The gene was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant enzyme was purified in one step. Chemical cross-linking and size exclusion chromatography indicated a homodimeric/tetrameric structure, in accordance with a dimer-based CPSase activity and reaction mechanism. This small enzyme, MS-s, synthesized carbamoyl phosphate from ATP, bicarbonate, and ammonia and catalyzed the same ATP-dependent partial reactions observed for full-length CPSases. Steady-state kinetics revealed a high apparent affinity for ATP and ammonia. Sequence comparisons, molecular modeling, and kinetic studies suggest that this enzyme corresponds to one of the two synthetase domains of the full-length CPSase that catalyze the ATP-dependent phosphorylations involved in the three-step synthesis of carbamoyl phosphate. This protein represents the smallest naturally occurring active CPSase characterized thus far. The small M. smithii CPSase appears to be specialized for carbamoyl phosphate metabolism in methanogens.
TI  - HuBac and nifH source tracking markers display a relationship to land use but not rainfall.
AB  - Identification of the source of fecal pollution is becoming a priority for states and territories in the U.S. in order to meet water quality standards and to develop and implement total maximum daily loads. The goal of this research was to relate microbial source tracking (MST) assay concentrations to land use and levels of impervious surfaces in order to gauge how increasing development is associated with human fecal contamination in inland watersheds. The concentrations of two proposed MST markers, targeting nifH of Methanobrevibacter smithii and HuBac of Bacteroides sp., were positively correlated with increasing anthropogenic development and impervious surfaces. Higher concentrations of these MST markers in more urbanized watersheds suggest that increasing development negatively affects water quality. Neither MST marker concentration was correlated with antecedent rainfall levels, and detection of markers did not differ between dry weather and rain events. Water samples were also analyzed for norovirus and enterovirus, but these enteric viruses were rarely detected. These MST results differ from previous studies that have found correlations between traditional fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) and antecedent rainfall. This difference suggests that the MST markers used in this study may be more specific for recent, land-based contamination events as opposed to resuspension of particle-associated organisms in waterways. HuBac was detected in 98% of samples, correlating with fecal coliform and Escherichia coli concentrations. The ubiquity of the HuBac marker in our samples suggests that this marker does not provide sufficiently different or additional information than FIB, and it is likely this marker was amplifying non-human targets. The nifH marker was detected in 30% of samples. Less than half of the nifH-positive samples contained levels of fecal coliforms or E. coli above regulatory thresholds, suggesting that nifH would be more useful when utilized simultaneously with FIB than in a tiered monitoring strategy. The results of this research suggests that land use factors play an important role in characterizing and mitigating fecal contamination in watersheds.
TI  - Effects of antimicrobial peptides on methanogenic archaea.
AB  - As members of the indigenous human microbiota found on several mucosal tissues, Methanobrevibacter smithii and Methanosphaera stadtmanae are exposed to the effects of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) secreted by these epithelia. Although antimicrobial and molecular effects of AMPs on bacteria are well described, data for archaea are not available yet. Besides, it is not clear whether AMPs affect them as the archaeal cell envelope differs profoundly in terms of chemical composition and structure from that of bacteria. The effects of different synthetic AMPs on growth of M. smithii, M. stadtmanae, and Methanosarcina mazei were tested using a microtiter plate assay adapted to their anaerobic growth requirements. All three tested methanoarchaea were highly sensitive against derivatives of human cathelicidin, of porcine lysin, and a synthetic antilipopolysaccharide peptide (Lpep); however, sensitivities differed markedly among the methanoarchaeal strains. The potent AMP concentrations affecting growth were below 10 muM, whereas growth of Escherichia coli WBB01 was not affected at peptide concentrations up to 10 muM under the same anaerobic growth conditions. Atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy revealed that the structural integrity of the methanoarchaeal cells is destroyed within 4 h after incubation with AMPs. The disruption of the cell envelope of M. smithii, M. stadtmanae, and M. mazei within a few minutes of exposure was verified by using LIVE/DEAD staining. Our results strongly suggest that the release of AMPs by eukaryotic epithelial cells is a potent defense mechanism targeting not only bacteria, but also methanoarchaea.
TI  - Evaluation of the nifH gene marker of Methanobrevibacter smithii for the detection of sewage pollution in environmental waters in Southeast Queensland, Australia.
AB  - This study aimed at evaluating the host-specificity and -sensitivity of the nifH  gene marker of Methanobrevibacter smithii by screening 272 fecal and wastewater samples from 11 animal species including humans in Southeast Queensland (SEQ), Australia. In addition, environmental water samples (n = 21) were collected during the dry and wet weather conditions and tested for the presence of the nifH marker along with other sewage-associated markers, namely, enterococci surface protein (esp) found in Enterococci faecium, Bacteroides HF183, adenoviruses (AVs), and polyomaviruses (PVs). The overall host-specificity of the nifH marker to differentiate between human and animal feces was 0.96 (maximum value of 1), while the overall sensitivity of this marker in human sourced feces and wastewater was 0.81 (maximum value of 1). Among the 21 environmental water samples tested, 2 (10%), 3 (14%), 12 (57%), 6 (29%), and 6 (29%) were positive for the nifH, esp, HF183, AVs and PVs markers, respectively. The prevalence of the nifH marker in environmental water samples, however, was low compared to other markers, suggesting that the use of this marker alone may not be sensitive enough to detect fecal pollution in environmental waters. The nifH marker, however, appears to be sewage-specific in SEQ, Australia, and therefore, it is recommended that this marker should be used as an additional marker in combination with the HF183 or viral markers such as AVs or PVs for accurate and sensitive detection of fecal pollution in SEQ waterways.
TI  - Validation and field testing of library-independent microbial source tracking methods in the Gulf of Mexico.
AB  - Water quality is frequently impacted by microbial pollution from human and animal feces. Microbial source tracking (MST) can identify dominant pollution sources and improve assessment of health risk compared to indicator bacteria alone. This study aims to standardize and validate MST methods across laboratories in coastal Gulf of Mexico states. Three laboratories evaluated library-independent MST methods for human sewage detection via conventional PCR: (1) human-associated Bacteroidales, (2) human polyomaviruses (HPyVs), and (3) Methanobrevibacter smithii. All methods detected targets in human sewage seeded into buffer, freshwater or marine water (100% sensitivity). The limit of detection (LOD) for human sewage was lowest for the Bacteroidales assay (10(-5)-10(-6) dilution). LODs for HPyVs and M. smithii assays were similar to each other (10(-3)-10(-4)), but were higher than Bacteroidales. The HPyVs assay was 100% specific, showing no cross-reactivity to dog, cow, cat, bird, or wild animal feces among >300 samples from three Gulf Coast regions. The human Bacteroidales assay was 96% specific, but cross-reacted with 10% of dog and some chicken samples. The M. smithii assay was 98% specific with limited cross-reactivity with cow, dog and seagull samples. An experts' workshop concluded that all methods showed sufficient accuracy and reliability to move forward. SOPs will be distributed to collaborating laboratories for further inter-laboratory comparison, and field validation will occur in year 2.
TI  - Quantification of human polyomaviruses JC Virus and BK Virus by TaqMan quantitative PCR and comparison to other water quality indicators in water and fecal samples.
AB  - In the United States, total maximum daily load standards for bodies of water that do not meet bacterial water quality standards are set by each state. The presence of human polyomaviruses (HPyVs) can be used as an indicator of human-associated sewage pollution in these waters. We have developed and optimized a TaqMan quantitative PCR (QPCR) assay based on the conserved T antigen to both quantify and simultaneously detect two HPyVs; JC virus and BK virus. The QPCR assay was able to consistently quantify > or =10 gene copies per reaction and is linear over 5 orders of magnitude. HPyVs were consistently detected in human waste samples (57 of 64) and environmental waters with known human fecal contamination (5 of 5) and were not amplified in DNA extracted from 127 animal waste samples from 14 species. HPyV concentrations in sewage decreased 81.2 and 84.2% over 28 days incubation at 25 and 35 degrees C, respectively. HPyVs results were compared to Escherichia coli, fecal coliform, and enterococci concentrations and the presence of three other human-associated microbes: Bacteroidetes, Methanobrevibacter smithii, and adenovirus. HPyVs were the most frequently detected of these in human and contaminated environmental samples and were more human specific than the Bacteroidetes (HF183) or M. smithii. HPyVs and M. smithii more closely mimicked the persistence of adenovirus in sewage than the other microbes. The use of this rapid and quantitative assay in water quality research could help regulatory agencies to identify sources of water pollution for improved remediation of contaminated waters and ultimately protect humans from exposure to pathogens.
TI  - Identification of archaeal rDNA from subgingival dental plaque by PCR amplification and sequence analysis.
AB  - A PCR assay for the amplification of small subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA) of Euryarchaea was developed and used to detect archaeal rDNA in 37 (77%) out of 48 pooled subgingival plaque samples from 48 patients suffering from periodontal disease. One major group of cloned periodontal sequences was identical to Methanobrevibacter oralis and a second minor group to Methanobrevibacter smithii. These two groups and a third novel group were found to be more than 98% similar to each other over an 0.65-kb segment of the 16S rRNA gene sequenced. M. oralis was found to be the predominant archaeon in the subgingival dental plaque. Phylogenetic analysis of partial SSU rDNA sequences revealed evidence for a distinct cluster for human and animal Methanobrevibacter sp. within the Methanobacteriaceae family.
TI  - Phylogenetic study of methanogens associated with rumen ciliates.
AB  - The phylogeny of methanogenic archaea associated with ciliate protozoa in a sheep rumen was investigated. Ruminal ciliate protozoa were exhaustively washed and mixtures of genomic DNA extracted. Archaea-specific nested PCR amplification was conducted with the ciliate genomic mixture. The resultant small subunit (16S) ribosomal RNA gene (ssu rDNA) was cloned into Escherichia coli JM 109. Many methanogens were still observed on and/or in ciliate cells by fluorescent microscopy even after exhaustive washing with buffer. Partial sequences of ssu rDNA close to Methanobrevibacter smithii were dominant in the retrieved sequences. RFLP analyses on the retrieved sequences revealed the absence of Methanobrevibacter ruminantium in the protozoal preparation. The association of Methanobrevibacter spp. with ruminal ciliate protozoa was demonstrated by the isolation of archaeal ssu rDNA phylogenetically close to that of M. smithii.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of a 12-gene cluster from Bacillus subtilis encoding nine enzymes for de novo purine nucleotide synthesis.
AB  - An approximately 16-kilobase pair region of the Bacillus subtilis chromosome at 55 degrees containing genes for de novo purine nucleotide synthesis (Piggot, P. J., and Hoch, J. A. (1985) Microbiol. Rev. 49, 158-179) was cloned. The nucleotide sequence of over 13 kilobase pairs indicates that this region contains a cluster of 12 genes, 11 of which encode enzymes that catalyze the 10 reactions for de novo purine nucleotide synthesis from 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate to IMP. The genes were identified by complementation of Escherichia coli pur mutants and by sequence comparisons with homologous enzymes. The cluster is likely an operon and is organized into three groups of overlapping genes followed by the last gene: purEKB-purC(orf)QLF-purMNH(J)-purD. Sequence comparisons provide evidence for homology of monofunctional purine nucleotide biosynthetic enzymes from B. subtilis with the corresponding multifunctional enzymes from yeast and Drosophila. Sequence alignment of the phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase heterodimer from B. subtilis with the monomeric enzyme from Methanobrevibacter smithii indicates an evolutionary relationship between these two enzymes. S1 nuclease analysis was used to map the mRNA 5' and 3' ends and to estimate levels of mRNA. These experiments indicate that synthesis of purine nucleotides is regulated independently by adenine and guanine nucleotides. Adenine nucleotides regulate transcription initiation. Guanine nucleotides regulate transcription by a termination-antitermination mechanism in a 242-nucleotide 5' untranslated mRNA leader region. Groups of overlapping genes, regulated at least in part by transcription termination-antitermination is likely to be a common theme for genetic organization and regulation of biosynthetic genes in this Gram-positive organism.
TI  - Sequence divergence of an archaebacterial gene cloned from a mesophilic and a thermophilic methanogen.
AB  - A 1.6-kb fragment of DNA from the thermophilic, methane-producing, anaerobic archaebacterium Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum delta H has been cloned and sequenced. This DNA complements mutations in both the purE1 and purE2 loci of Escherichia coli. The sequence of the M. thermoautotrophicum DNA predicts that complementation in E. coli results from the synthesis of a polypeptide with a molecular weight of 36,249. A polypeptide apparently of this molecular weight is synthesized in E. coli minicells containing recombinant plasmids that carry the cloned fragment of methanogen DNA. We have previously cloned and sequenced a purE-complementing gene from the mesophilic methanogen Methanobrevibacter smithii. The two methanogen-derived purE-complementing genes are 53% homologous and encode polypeptides that are 45% homologous in their amino acid sequences but would be 74% homologous if conservative amino acid substitutions were considered as maintaining sequence homology. The genome of M. thermoautotrophicum has a molar G + C content of 49.7%, whereas the genome of M. smithii is 30.6% G + C. Conservation of encoded amino acids while accommodating the very different G + C contents is accomplished by use of different codons that encode the same amino acid. The majority of base changes occur at the third codon position. The intergenic regions of the cloned M. thermoautotrophicum DNA contain sequences previously identified as ribosome binding sites and as putative methanogen promoters. Although the two purE-complementing genes are apparently derived from a common ancestor, only the gene from M. smithii maintains a codon usage that conforms to the RNY rule.
TI  - Structure of genes and an insertion element in the methane producing archaebacterium Methanobrevibacter smithii.
AB  - DNA fragments cloned from the methanogenic archaebacterium Methanobrevibacter smithii which complement mutations in the purE and proC genes of E. coli have been sequenced. Sequence analyses, transposon mutagenesis and expression in E. coli minicells indicate that purE and proC complementations result from the synthesis of M. smithii polypeptides with molecular weights of 36,697 and 27,836 respectively. The encoding genes appear to be located in operons. The M. smithii genome contains 69% A/T basepairs (bp) which is reflected in unusual codon usages and intergenic regions containing approximately 85% A/T bp. An insertion element, designated ISM1, was found within the cloned M. smithii DNA located adjacent to the proC complementing region. ISM1 is 1381 bp in length, has 29 bp terminal inverted repeat sequences and contains one major ORF encoded in 87% of the ISM1 sequence. ISM1 is mobile, present in approximately 10 copies per genome and integration duplicates 8 bp at the site of insertion. The duplicated sequences show homology with sequences within the 29 bp terminal repeat sequence of ISM1. Comparison of our data with sequences from halophilic archaebacteria suggests that 5'GAANTTTCA and 5'TTTTAATATAAA may be consensus promoter sequences for archaebacteria. These sequences closely resemble the consensus sequences which precede Drosophila heat-shock genes (Pelham 1982; Davidson et al. 1983). Methanogens appear to employ the eubacterial system of mRNA: 16SrRNA hybridization to ensure initiation of translation; the consensus ribosome binding sequence is 5'AGGTGA.
