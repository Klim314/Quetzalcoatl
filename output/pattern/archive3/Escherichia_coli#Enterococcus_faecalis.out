polyamine derivatives of betulinic acid and beta-sitosterol: a comparative investigation.
beta-sitosterol and betulinic acid were used in designing their conjugates with selected polyamines bearing either an amide bond, or an ester and an amide bond simultaneously in the target molecule. the synthesized compounds were subjected to basic cytotoxic and antimicrobial tests. the synthetic protocol is described separately for each of the three series of the target amides, because each series of compounds required a different synthetic approach. the cytotoxicity was tested on cells derived from human t-lymphoblastic leukemia, breast adenocarcinoma and cervical cancer, and compared with the tests on normal human fibroblasts. most of the target compounds (5a-5c, 11a-11c and 16a-16c) showed medium to high cytotoxicity (0.7-7.8mum), however, in some cases the compounds showed high cytotoxicity even toward normal human fibroblasts (11a-11c). two compounds of this series (11c and 16c) also displayed antimicrobial activity with high and selective microbe specificity. the compound 11c was potent against escherichia coli (minimal inhibition concentration (mic) 6.25mugml(-1), i.e. 9.75nmml(-1)) and staphylococcus aureus (mic 12.5mugml(-1), i.e. 19.5nmml(-1)), and showed medium activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa. the compound 16c was highly active against enterococcus faecalis and s. aureus (both, mic 3.125mugml(-1), i.e. 4.22nmml(-1)), both gram-positive bacteria, however showed only weak activity against e. coli and no activity against p. aeruginosa, both gram-negative bacteria, which indicates possible microbe specificity of 16c. comparing beta-sitosterol-based series (5a-5c) and betulinic acid series (11a-11c and 16a-16c) of the target compounds, the latter one gave more promising structures. the compounds 11c and 16c showed effects which may be described as multifarious activity (pleiotropic effects).
2-alkyl(aryl)-quinazolin-4(3h)-thiones, 2-r-(quinazolin-4(3h)-ylthio)carboxylic acids and amides: synthesis, molecular docking, antimicrobial and anticancer properties.
in this study, a series of novel 2-alkyl(aryl)-quinazolin-4(3h)-thiones, 2-r-(quinazolin-4(3h)-ylthio)carboxylic acids and amides were synthesized and evaluated for antimicrobial and anticancer activities. their structure was confirmed by elemental analysis and spectral data (ft-ir, lc-ms, 1h-nmr). antimicrobial activity was tested in vitro against staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia, candida albicans and nci in vitro preliminary anticancer activity against nine different cancer types. the most active antibacterial and antifungal compounds were: 2.1, 2.2 and 2.4. the introduction of the carboxylic acid or amide residue into the fourth position of quinazolin-4(3h)-thione resulted in the absence of antimicrobial activity. substance 3.8 inhibited renal cancer uo-31 line and 2.18 - leukemia ccrf-cem. the results of in silico molecular docking for dhfr and ck2 kinase had no correlation with in vitro properties, proposing the presence of other biological activity pathways.
nonselective mevalonate kinase inhibitor as a novel class of antibacterial agents.
introduction. there are a few evidences about targeting isoprenoids biosynthesis  pathway in bacteria for finding new antibiotics. this study was conducted to assess antibacterial effects of vanadyl sulfate (vs), one of the mevalonate kinase inhibitors to find a new target for killing bacteria. materials and methods. antibacterial effect of vs alone and in combination with glycine or edta was assessed on escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa as gram-negative and staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis as gram-positive bacteria using serial dilution method and minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) identified. result. mics for s. aureus and e. coli were 4 and 8 mg/ml, respectively. vs could not affect the growth of two other bacteria. however, vs in combination with glycine not only inhibited the growth of e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa, but also reduced mics for vs-sensitive bacteria (s. aureus and e. coli). edta could reduce mic for e. coli and p. aeruginosa. conclusion. vs could inhibit the growth of s. aurous and e. coli, and adding glycine or edta improved vs antibacterial activity presumably via instability of the cell wall and enhanced transport of vs through bacterial cell wall. inhibition of the isoprenoid pathway might provide new tools to overcome bacterial resistance.
extraction, characterization and antimicrobial activity of sulfated polysaccharides from fish skins.
sulfated polysaccharides were extracted from gray triggerfish (gtsp) and smooth hound (shsp) skins. their chemical and physical characteristics were determined using x-ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopic analysis. the antibacterial activities of gtsp and shsp against listeria monocytogenes (atcc 43251), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 25923), enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212), escherichia coli (atcc 25922), salmonella enterica (atcc 43972) and enterobacter sp were evaluated by determining clear growth inhibition zone diameters and the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values and by essays in liquid media. gtsp and shsp were fractionated by a diethylaminoethyl-cellulose chromatography. fraction fgii, from gtsp, and fraction fsii, from shsp, showed the most important inhibitory effects against the tested bacterial species. the sulfated polysaccharides from fish skins did not show hemolytic activity towards bovine erythrocytes. overall, the results suggested that those polysaccharides could offer promising sources of polysaccharides for future application as dietary ingredients in the nutraceutical industry.
synthesis of silver nanoparticles using solanum trilobatum fruits extract and its antibacterial, cytotoxic activity against human breast cancer cell line mcf 7.
in the present study, we have synthesized silver nanoparticles by a simple and eco-friendly method using unripe fruits of solanum trilobatum. the aqueous silver ions when exposed to unripe fruits extract were reduced and stabilized over long time resulting in biosynthesis of surface functionalized silver nanoparticles. the bio-reduced silver nanoparticles were characterized by uv-visible spectroscopy, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir), scanning electron microscopy (sem), transmission electron microscopy (tem), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (edx) and x-ray diffraction (xrd). these biologically synthesized silver nanoparticles were tested for its antibacterial activity against few human pathogenic bacteria including gram-positive (streptococcus mutans, enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae) bacteria. in addition, we also demonstrated anticancer activity of these nanoparticles in vitro against human breast cancer cell line (mcf 7) using mtt, nuclear morphology assay, western blot and rt-pcr expression. these results taken together show the potential applications of biosynthesized silver nanoparticles using s. trilobatum fruits.
in vitro spectrum of pexiganan activity when tested against pathogens from diabetic foot infections and with selected resistance mechanisms.
pexiganan, a 22-amino-acid synthetic cationic peptide, is currently in phase 3 clinical trials as a topical antimicrobial agent for the treatment of mild infections associated with diabetic foot ulcers. bacterial isolates from the 2013 sentry antimicrobial surveillance program designated as pathogens from diabetic foot infections (dfi) and gram-negative and -positive pathogens from various infection types that harbored selected resistance mechanisms/phenotypes were tested against pexiganan in reference cation-adjusted mueller-hinton broth. the mic50 and mic90 against all organisms tested from dfi were 16 and 32 mug/ml, respectively. escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter koseri, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter species, and pseudomonas aeruginosa mic values ranged from 8 to 16 mug/ml. pexiganan mic values among staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant s. aureus [mrsa] and methicillin-susceptible s. aureus [mssa]), beta-hemolytic streptococci, and enterococcus faecium ranged from 8 to 32 mug/ml. pexiganan activity was not adversely affected for members of the family enterobacteriaceae or p. aeruginosa that produced beta-lactamases or resistance mechanisms to other commonly used antimicrobial agents. decreased susceptibility to vancomycin did not affect pexiganan activity against s. aureus or e. faecium. enterococcus faecalis appears to be intrinsically less susceptible to pexiganan (mic, 32 to 256 mug/ml). the "all organism" mic90 of 32 mug/ml for pexiganan in this study was >250-fold below the pexiganan concentration in the cream/delivery vehicle being developed for topical use.
antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of alcoholic extracts obtained from vegetative organs of a. retroflexus.
in vitro antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of amaranthus retroflexus leaves and inflorescence alcoholic (ethanol 70%) extracts of various concentrations ranging from 0.78 to 400 mul/ml were analyzed on different clinical and reference bacterial strains (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtills, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii) and fungal strains (candida albicans, c. famata, c. utilis, saccharomyces cerevisiae) using agar disk diffusion method and broth dilution method (mic determination) for antimicrobial activity and teac (trolox capacity) assay for the evaluation of the antioxidant activity. the adapted diffusion method was used to test the antimicrobial effect of the extracts separately and in combination with a range of standard antibiotics, in order to evidence any synergic effects of a. retroflexus extracts on the antibiotics activity. the extracts showed the highest inhibitory effect against k. pneumoniae and b. subtilis with no activity against s. aureus among the bacterial strains, while in case of the fungal strains the most intensive effect was exhibited against c. famata by both extracts. the a. retroflexus leaves extract improved the ciprofloxacin and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid activity towards the p. aeruginosa clinical strain. the inflorescences extract significantly increased chloramphenicol activity on b. subtilis strain. the antioxidant activity assay showed that the studied extracts exhibited the ability to neutralize the free radicals leading to the conclusion that the tested extracts bear compounds with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial and antioxidant activity that could represent a potential alternative for treating various infectious diseases.
synthesis, antibacterial, antioxidant activity and qsar studies of novel 2-arylidenehydrazinyl-4-arylthiazole analogues.
a novel series of 2-arylidenehydrazinyl-4-arylthiazole analogues (3a-p) was designed and synthesized in excellent yields using a rapid, simple, efficient methodology. sixteen novel compounds were screened for in vitro antimicrobial activities against eleven bacteria, namely, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis, klebsiella pneumonia, citrobacter freundii, cronobacter sakazakii, salmonella enteritidis, escherichia coli, yersinia pestis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. all 16 compounds showed significant anti-bacterial activities against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. in particular, compound 3g showed potent inhibition of e. coli and k. pneumonia, compound 3i inhibited e. faecalis, compound 3n s. tythi and e. faecalis, and compound 3c e. coli and c. sakazakii. in fact, our results indicate that most of the compounds synthesized exhibit strong antibacterial activity. the qualitative structure-antibacterial activity relationships (qsar) were studied using the physicochemical and quantum-chemical parameters of the ab initio hartree-fock model at the rhf/6-31g level of theory. a good qualitative correlation between predicted physicochemical parameters (log p and polar surface area (psa)) and antibacterial activity has been found. the synthesized compounds were also evaluated for antioxidant activity. compounds 3j, 3a and 3i exhibited the greatest antioxidant activity, with ic50 values of 0.66, 0.81, and 1.08 microm, respectively, which were comparable to that of ascorbic acid (ic50 0.87 microm). the promising antibacterial and antioxidant activities of some of these synthesized 2-arylidenehydrazinyl-4-arylthiazole derivatives, together with the results of quantum-chemical studies, could be helpful for the development of drugs to combat diseases caused by microorganisms and oxidative stress.
in vitro antimicrobial activity of an experimental dentifrice based on ricinus communis.
this study evaluated the antimicrobial activity of a ricinus communis-based experimental dentifrice for denture hygiene against the following standard strains: staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, streptococcus mutans, enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans and candida glabrata. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) assay was performed with r. communis in pure oil at 2.5%. only e. coli was not inhibited by r. communis, but the mic (0.0781%) was effective against the other microorganisms. from these results it was determined the r. communis concentrations for experimental dentifrices, 1, 2, 5 and 10%, which were evaluated by the test-well diffusion in agar. the commercial dentifrices colgate, trihydral and corega brite were tested for comparative purposes. the diameter of the zones of bacterial growth inhibition produced around the wells was measured (in mm) with a rule under reflected light. data were analyzed statistically by analysis of variance and tukey's post-hoc test (alpha=0.05). neither the commercial nor the experimental dentifrices were effective against e. coli. the experimental dentifrices containing r. communis at 2, 5 and 10% presented action against s. mutans, s. aureaus and e. faecallis. the experimental dentifrices showed no antimicrobial activity against candida spp. and e. coli in any of the tested concentrations. trihydral was the most effective. comparing the experimental dentifrices, the product with 10% r. communis produced the largest zones of bacterial growth inhibition and had similar antimicrobial activity to the commercial dentifrices, except against s. aureus.
bacteriophages as an alternative strategy for fighting biofilm development.
the ability of microbes to form biofilms is an important element of their pathogenicity, and biofilm formation is a serious challenge for today's medicine. fighting the clinical complications associated with biofilm formation is very difficult and linked to a high risk of failure, especially in a time of increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics. bacterial species most commonly isolated from biofilms include coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. the frequent failure of antibiotic therapy led researchers to look for alternative methods and experiment with the use of antibacterial factors with a mechanism of action different from that of antibiotics. experimental studies with bacteriophages and mixtures thereof, expressing lytic properties against numerous biofilm-forming bacterial species showed that bacteriophages may both prevent biofilm formation and contribute to eradication of biofilm bacteria. a specific role is played here by phage depolymerases, which facilitate the degradation of extracellular polymeric substances (eps) and thus the permeation of bacteriophages into deeper biofilm layers and lysis of the susceptible bacterial cells. much hope is placed in genetic modifications of bacteriophages that would allow the equipping bacteriophages with the function of depolymerase synthesis. the use of phage cocktails prevents the development of phage-resistant bacteria.
antibacterial efficiency of vermiculite/chlorhexidine nanocomposites and results  of the in vivo test of harmlessness of vermiculite.
clay minerals have been proposed as very useful materials for modulating drug delivery. these are the commonly used materials in pharmaceutical production both as inorganic carriers or active agents. we focused on the development of suitable long-acting material for local treatment of oral infection where clay minerals act as inorganic drug carriers. organovermiculites with antibacterial activity were prepared by ion exchange reactions using different concentrations of chlorhexidine diacetate. the samples were characterized by x-ray diffraction (xrd), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir) and thermal analysis (tga). the antibacterial activity was evaluated by finding the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic). all studied organoclays possessed good antibacterial activity after 24h exposure against escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis and particularly against staphylococcus aureus. pseudomonas aeruginosa however proved very resistant as only the sample with the highest concentration of ca that successfully inhibited bacterial growth. furthermore, clay mineral vermiculite was subjected to in vivo toxicological analysis and its influence on gastrointestinal tract during its oral application was investigated. tissue samples from buccal mucosa, tongue, esophagus, stomach, terminal duodenum, small intestine, caecum, distal colon and liver were subjected to histological examination, both macroscopically and microscopically. neither systemic nor local reactions were observed. therefore the toxicity of vermiculite to a mammal model organism can be excluded.
eco-designed biohybrids based on liposomes, mint-nanosilver and carbon nanotubes  for antioxidant and antimicrobial coating.
noncovalent entities (consisting of liposomes, phyto-nanosilver and carbon nanotubes) with interesting properties were constructed by a "green" bottom-up method. phytosynthesis of silver nanoparticles using the mentha piperita extract combines the benefits of this herb with the interesting properties of silver. the obtained silver-based biohybrids showed antioxidant and antimicrobial properties that have been considerable improved in the presence of carbon nanotubes. thus the eco-designed bioconstructs consisting of cholesterol-containing liposomes, phytonanosilver and carbon nanotubes exhibited high antioxidant activity (aa=90.8%) and have been shown to be strong biocides offering inhibition zone of 25mm against escherichia coli and 23mm against staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis.
investigation of antimicrobial resistance in escherichia coli and enterococci isolated from tibetan pigs.
objectives: this study investigated the antimicrobial resistance of escherichia coli and enterococci isolated from free-ranging tibetan pigs in tibet, china, and analyzed the influence of free-ranging husbandry on antimicrobial resistance. methods: a total of 232 fecal samples were collected from tibetan pigs, and the disk diffusion method was used to examine their antimicrobial resistance. broth microdilution and agar dilution methods were used to determine minimum inhibitory concentrations for antimicrobial agents for which disks were not commercially available. results: a total of 129 e. coli isolates and 84 enterococcus isolates were recovered from the fecal samples. all e. coli isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and 40.4% were resistant to tetracycline. a small number of isolates were resistant to florfenicol (27.9%), ampicillin (27.9%), sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (19.4%), nalidixic acid (19.4%), streptomycin (16.2%) and ceftiofur (10.9%), and very low resistance rates to ciprofloxacin (7.8%), gentamicin (6.9%), and spectinomycin (2.3%) were observed in e. coli. all enterococcus isolates, including e. faecium, e. faecalis, e. hirae, and e. mundtii, were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and vancomycin, but showed high frequencies of resistance to oxacillin (92.8%), clindamycin (82.1%), tetracycline (64.3%), and erythromycin (48.8%). resistance rates to florfenicol (17.9%), penicillin (6.0%), ciprofloxacin (3.6%), levofloxacin (1.2%), and ampicillin (1.2%) were low. only one high-level streptomycin resistant e. faecium isolate and one high-level gentamicin resistant e. faecium isolate were observed. approximately 20% and 70% of e. coli and enterococcus isolates, respectively, were defined as multidrug-resistant. conclusions: in this study, e. coli and enterococcus isolated from free-ranging tibetan pigs showed relatively lower resistance rates than those in other areas of china, where more intensive farming practices are used. these results also revealed that free-range husbandry and absence of antibiotic use could decrease the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance to some extent.
toxicity of magnetic chitosan micro and nanoparticles as carriers for biologically active substances.
nanoparticles of inorganic magnetic core surrounded by layers of functional coatings are potential representatives of nanostructures for immobilization of bio-substances. magnetic nanoparticles (mnps) are often bound in aggregates due to a strong magnetic dipole, which has a lot of advantages, such as large surface area for binding biologically active substances. chitosan is a polysaccharide polymer that is non-toxic, hydrophilic, biocompatible and has hydroxy and amino groups in its structure. because of these chemical and biological properties it is a desirable bio-product for immobilization of enzymes and for binding of other biologically active substances. magnetic micro and nanoparticles were synthesized with chitosan by three different methods; microemulsion process, suspension cross-linking technique and covalent binding of chitosan. toxic effect of the prepared magnetic particles was determined as well and was examined on five different bacterial cultures; escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and klebsiella pneumoniae. at concentrations of 10-30 mg of magnetic particles per 0.5 mcfarland standard solution of e. coli and per 400 cfu of s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, e. faecalis in k. pneumonia, no inhibition on the chosen bacterial cultures was detected.
novel benzoxazoles: synthesis and antibacterial, antifungal, and antitubercular activity against antibiotic-resistant and -sensitive microbes.
a new series of 5-(p-substituted benzamido/phenylacetamido)-2-(p-tert-butylphenyl)benzoxazole derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for their antibacterial, antifungal, and antimycobacterial activities against antibiotic-resistant and -sensitive staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and mycobacterium tuberculosis as well as against candida albicans and candida krusei. the compounds possessed broad-spectrum activity against all of the tested gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and yeasts, their minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) ranging between 16-128 microg/ml. one compound exhibited significant antibacterial activity (16 microg/ml) against an antibiotic-resistant enterococcus faecalis isolate, having twice the potency of the compared standard drugs vancomycin and gentamycin sulfate. the compounds also showed moderate antitubercular activity with mic values between 8-128 microg/ml against mycobacterium tuberculosis and its clinical isolate.
effects of single- and multi-strain probiotics on biofilm formation and in vitro  adhesion to bladder cells by urinary tract pathogens.
purpose: there is increasing evidence that probiotic bacteria can inhibit and/or  prevent urinary tract infections. possible mechanisms include prevention of adhesion of pathogens to the bladder epithelium and inhibition of biofilm formation. currently there is interest in the comparative efficacy of single probiotics vs. strain mixtures. we have therefore tested the inhibitory activity of four single probiotics and four probiotic mixtures towards the urinary tract pathogens escherichia coli nctc 9001 and enterococcus faecalis nctc 00775. methods: inhibition of biofilm formation by cell-free supernatants was tested using the crystal violet assay, while prevention of pathogen adhesion to host cells was tested by using bladder cancer cells as a model for the human urinary tract. results: under ph-controlled conditions, there was no significant inhibition of biofilm formation by any treatment. without ph control, 5/8 treatments significantly inhibited biofilm production by e. coli, while 5/8 treatments inhibited production by e. faecalis. using data from all crystal violet assays, there was no significant difference in the ability of single- and multi-strain probiotics to inhibit biofilm formation. in the cell culture assays, all treatments were able to significantly reduce numbers of pathogenic cells adhering to host cells by 2.5-3.5 logs. no significant difference was observed between the displacement caused by single strains and mixtures for either pathogen. conclusions: inhibition of biofilm seems to be a major mechanism of urinary tract pathogen exclusion, related to, and possibly dependent upon, the probiotic ability to reduce environmental ph. exclusion via competition of binding sites is a possible in vivo mechanism for these probiotics. if an additive or synergistic effect exists between strains within a mixture, it does not manifest itself in a greater effect through these two inhibitory mechanisms.
recombinant human lipocalin 2 acts as an antibacterial agent to prevent platelet  contamination.
background: bacterial contamination of platelet products is the major infectious  risk in blood transfusion medicine, which can result in life-threatening sepsis in recipient. lipocalin 2 (lcn2) is an iron-sequestering protein in the antibacterial innate immune response, which inhibit bacterial growth. this study was aimed to evaluate the antibacterial property of lcn2 in preventing bacterial contamination of platelets. methods: recombinant lcn2 was expressed in a eukaryotic expression system and following purification and characterization of the recombinant lcn2, its minimum inhibitory concentration was determined. then, platelet concentrates were inoculated with various concentrations of staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecalis, and the antibacterial effects of lcn2 was evaluated at 20-24 degrees c. results: results revealed that lcn2 effectively inhibited the growth of 1.5 x 10(4) cfu/ml s. epidermidis, p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, e. coli, and e. faecalis at 40 ng/ml. at this concentration, lcn2 also inhibited the growth of 1.5 x 10(3) cfu/ml staphylococcus aureus and proteus mirabilis. conclusion: recombinant lcn2 inhibited growth of a variety of platelet-contaminating bacteria. therefore, supplementation of platelet concentrates with lcn2 may reduce bacterial contamination.
antimicrobial activity of the marine alkaloids, clathrodin and oroidin, and their synthetic analogues.
marine organisms produce secondary metabolites that may be valuable for the development of novel drug leads as such and can also provide structural scaffolds for the design and synthesis of novel bioactive compounds. the marine alkaloids, clathrodin and oroidin, which were originally isolated from sponges of the genus, agelas, were prepared and evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against three bacterial strains (enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli) and one fungal strain (candida albicans), and oroidin was found to possess promising gram-positive antibacterial activity. using oroidin as a scaffold, 34 new analogues were designed, prepared and screened for their antimicrobial properties. of these compounds, 12 exhibited >80% inhibition of the growth of at least one microorganism at a concentration of 50 microm. the most active derivative was found to be 4-phenyl-2-aminoimidazole 6h, which exhibited mic(9)(0) (minimum inhibitory concentration) values of 12.5 microm against the gram-positive bacteria and 50 microm against e. coli. the selectivity index between s. aureus and mammalian cells, which is important to consider in the evaluation of a compound's potential as an antimicrobial lead, was found to be 2.9 for compound 6h.
antimicrobial susceptibility of indicator bacteria isolated from chickens in southeast asian countries (vietnam, indonesia and thailand).
to determine the prevalence of indicator bacteria resistant to antimicrobials among poultry in three southeast asian countries (vietnam, indonesia and thailand), we examined the antimicrobial susceptibilities of commensal bacteria isolated from chickens. in total, 125, 117 and 180 isolates of escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, respectively, were used to test for antimicrobial susceptibility. bacterial resistance to antimicrobial treatment was most frequently observed with oxytetracycline with a prevalence of 73.6% (e. coli), 69.2% (e. faecalis) and 92.2% (e. faecium). resistance to fluoroquinolones, which are critically important medicines, was also frequently observed in e. coli (48.8%), e. faecalis (17.9%) and e. faecium (82.8%). the prevalence of indicator bacteria resistant to most of the antimicrobials tested in these countries was higher than those for developed countries. the factors underlying antimicrobial resistance may include inappropriate and/or excessive use of antimicrobials. these results highlight the need for monitoring the emergence and prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in developing countries.
detection, partial purification and characterization of bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus brevis fptlb3 isolated from freshwater fish: bacteriocin from lb. brevis fptlb3.
lactobacillus brevis fptlb3 was isolated from freshwater fish, capable of producing bacteriocin that had broad spectrum of inhibition (3200 au/ml) against escherichia coli mtcc 1563, enterococcus faecalis mtcc 2729, lactobacillus casei mtcc 1423, lactobacillus sakei atcc 15521 and staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923. the antimicrobial activity of crude supernatant fluid was stable after heating at 121 degrees c for 60 min and declined thereafter. stability of antimicrobial activity was observed at ph range of 2.0 to 8.0. its active principle was proteinaceous in nature since the bacteriocin was inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, but not by other non-proteolytic enzymes. mitomycin c and uv light did not affect the activity of the bacteriocin, while chloroform extraction completely destroyed their activity. exposure to surfactant resulted in an increase in titre, except nonidet p-40, which led to total loss of activity. no bacteriocin adsorption was detected at ph 1 to 2, whereas 100% bacteriocin adsorption was found at ph 6.5. based on tricine sds-page the estimated molecular mass of bacteriocin was 54 kda. no plasmid was found to present in the isolate.
chitosan-cellulose composite for wound dressing material. part 2. antimicrobial activity, blood absorption ability, and biocompatibility.
chitosan (cs), a polysaccharide derived from chitin, the second most abundant polysaccharide, is widely used in the medical world because of its natural and nontoxic properties and its innate ability for antibacterial and hemostasis effects. in this study, the novel composites containing cs and cellulose (cel) (i.e., [cel + cs]), which we have previously synthesized using a green and totally recyclable method, were investigated for their antimicrobial activity, absorption of anticoagulated whole blood, anti-inflammatory activity through the reduction of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) and interleukin-6 (il-6), and the biocompatibility with human fibroblasts. the [cel + cs] composites were found to inhibit the growth of both gram positive and negative micro-organisms. for examples, the regenerated 100% lyophilized chitosan material was found to reduce growth of escherichia coli (atcc 8739 and vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecalis (atcc 51299) by 78, 36, and 64%, respectively. the composites are nontoxic to fibroblasts; that is, fibroblasts, which are critical to the formation of connective tissue matrix were found to grow and proliferate in the presence of the composites. they effectively absorb blood, and at the same rate and volume as commercially available wound dressings. the composites, in both air-dried and lyophilized forms, significantly inhibit the production of tnf-alpha and il-6 by stimulated macrophages. these results clearly indicate that the biodegradable, biocompatible and nontoxic [cel + cs] composites, particularly those dried by lyophilizing, can be effectively used as a material in wound dressings.
in vitro evaluation of the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection  treatment with photolysis of hydrogen peroxide.
the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection treatment with photolysis of h2o2 and comparing this with existing antibacterial agents. we tested seven antibacterial agents, including amoxicillin, cefepime hydrochloride, erythromycin, ofloxacin, clindamycin hydrochloride, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, and minocycline hydrochloride, as positive controls for validation of the assay protocol. for all of the agents tested, at least one of the four bacterial species (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and streptococcus salivarius) was resistant to these agents by repeated exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of the agents up to 10 times. in contrast, antibacterial activity against any of the bacterial species tested (s. aureus, e. faecalis, e. coli, s. salivarius, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus mutans, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) was not affected by repeated exposure to the disinfection treatment up to 40 times. this finding suggested that the risk of inducing bacterial resistance by disinfection treatment was low. the active ingredient of this disinfection treatment is hydroxyl radicals generated by photolysis of h2o2. therefore, hydroxyl radicals interact with several cell structures and different metabolic pathways in microbial cells, probably resulting in a lack of development of bacterial resistance. in conclusion, disinfection treatment with photolysis of h2o2 appears to be a potential alternative for existing antimicrobial agents in terms of a low risk of inducing bacterial resistance.
photocatalytic antibacterial effects are maintained on resin-based tio2 nanocomposites after cessation of uv irradiation.
photocatalysis induced by tio2 and uv light constitutes a decontamination and antibacterial strategy utilized in many applications including self-cleaning environmental surfaces, water and air treatment. the present work reveals that antibacterial effects induced by photocatalysis can be maintained even after the cessation of uv irradiation. we show that resin-based composites containing 20% tio2 nanoparticles continue to provide a pronounced antibacterial effect against the pathogens escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis for up to two hours post uv. for biomaterials or implant coatings, where direct uv illumination is not feasible, a prolonged antibacterial effect after the cessation of the illumination would offer new unexplored treatment possibilities.
antibacterial effects of curcumin: an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration study.
aim: to evaluate the antibacterial effect of curcumin with the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) method in standard bacterial strains. methods: the in vitro antibacterial activity of curcumin was evaluated against methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (atcc 29213), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (atcc 43300), enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212), bacillus subtilis (atcc 6633), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 27853), escherichia coli (atcc 25922) and klebsiella pneumoniae (atcc 700603) using the macrodilution broth susceptibility test method. after incubation in tubes, the antibacterial activity of curcumin was detected by a lack of turbidity, which indicated the inhibition of bacterial growth. the concentration in the tube with the highest dilution showing no turbidity was defined as the mic. results: the curcumin mic values were 175 microg/ml, 129 microg/ml, 219 microg/ml, 217 microg/ml, 163 microg/ml, 293 microg/ml and 216 microg/ml against p. aeruginosa, b. subtilis, mssa, mrsa, e. coli, e. faecalis and k. pneumonia, respectively. conclusion: this study revealed antibacterial effects of curcumin against standard bacterial strains in high concentrations. animal experiments have demonstrated that curcumin applied at high doses has strong antibacterial activity. there is a need for further in vivo studies to shed light on antibacterial effects of curcumin with high concentrations.
the two functional enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductases of enterococcus faecalis do not mediate triclosan resistance.
enoyl-acyl carrier protein (enoyl-acp) reductase catalyzes the last step of the elongation cycle in the synthesis of bacterial fatty acids. the enterococcus faecalis genome contains two genes annotated as enoyl-acp reductases, a fabi-type enoyl-acp reductase and a fabk-type enoyl-acp reductase. we report that expression of either of the two proteins restores growth of an escherichia coli fabi temperature-sensitive mutant strain under nonpermissive conditions. in vitro assays demonstrated that both proteins support fatty acid synthesis and are active with substrates of all fatty acid chain lengths. although expression of e. faecalis fabk confers to e. coli high levels of resistance to the antimicrobial triclosan, deletion of fabk from the e. faecalis genome showed that fabk does not play a detectable role in the inherent triclosan resistance of e. faecalis. indeed, fabk seems to play only a minor role in modulating fatty acid composition. strains carrying a deletion of fabk grow normally without fatty acid supplementation, whereas fabi deletion mutants make only traces of fatty acids and are unsaturated fatty acid auxotrophs. importance: the finding that exogenous fatty acids support growth of e. faecalis strains defective in fatty acid synthesis indicates that inhibitors of fatty acid synthesis are ineffective in countering e. faecalis infections because host serum fatty acids support growth of the bacterium.
microwave-assisted synthesis, characterization and antibacterial activity of ag/zno nanoparticles supported bentonite clay.
composites of silver-zinc oxide nanoparticles supported on bentonite clay were synthesized by the microwave-assisted synthesis method for use as an antibacterial material. silver nitrate was used as the precursor of silver nanoparticles while zinc oxide nanoparticles were commercially sourced. the composites were characterized by powder x-ray diffraction (xrd), transmission electron microscope (tem), fourier transform infrared (ftir) and bet surface area measurements. xrd spectra showed peaks of silver confirming the formation of the silver and not of the silver nitrate or any other impurity of the metal. meanwhile tem confirmed the formation of silver and zinc oxide nanoparticles on the clay layers, with particle sizes ranging from 9-30 nm and 15-70 nm, respectively. the antibacterial activities of the composites were evaluated against gram negative escherichia coli bacteria and gram positive enterococcus faecalis bacteria by the disc diffusion method. whereas both composites of ag-clay and zno-clay showed good antibacterial activity against bacteria, a better antibacterial activity was observed with ag/zno-clay composite. the results therefore reveal that ag/zno-clay composite is a promising bactericide that can be used for deactivating microbes in water.
new function of molybdenum trioxide nanoplates: toxicity towards pathogenic bacteria through membrane stress.
inorganic nanostructures are highly recognized for their potential use in the development of new functional materials for biomedical applications. in this study, we investigated the antibacterial efficiency of molybdenum trioxide (moo3) nanoplates against four types of pathogenic bacteria. moo3 nanoplates are synthesized by a simple wet chemical approach. x-ray diffraction and ft-ir analysis showed the presence of an orthorhombic phase of moo3 nanoplates. field emission scanning electron microscope studies confirmed the formation of plate-like structures of moo3. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of moo3 nanoplates against pathogenic bacteria was evaluated using a microdilution method. mics such as 8mug/ml (against escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium), 16mug/ml (against enterococcus faecalis), and 8mug/ml (against bacillus subtilis) show that moo3 nanoplates have predominant antibacterial activity compared to the standard antibiotic, kanamycin. evaluation of bacterial enzymatic (beta-d-galactosidase) activity in the hydrolysis of o-nitrophenol and beta-d-galactopyranoside suggested the disruption of the bacterial cell wall mechanism responsible for bacterial toxicity.
microwave assisted synthesis of dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-ones;  synthesis, in vitro antimicrobial and anticancer activities of novel coumarin substituted dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-ones.
the present article describes the synthesis of dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one (2a-h) under microwave irradiation. the product was obtained in excellent yield (74-94%) in a shorter reaction time (2 min). these molecules (2a, b) further reacted with various substituted 4-bromomethylcoumarins (3a-f) to yield a new series of coumarin substituted dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-ones (4a-h). the structure of all the synthesized compounds were confirmed by spectral studies and screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against three gram-positive bacteria viz., staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus mutans and three gram-negative bacteria viz., escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia, pseudomonas aeruginosa and antifungal activity against candida albicans, aspergillus niger, aspergillus fumigatus, aspergillus flavus, fusarium oxysporum, penicillium chrysogenum and anticancer activity against dalton's ascitic lymphoma (dal) cell line. in general, all the compounds possessed better antifungal properties than antibacterial properties. the coumarin substituted dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one (4g) (r = i-pr, r(1) = 6-cl) was found to be the most potent cytotoxic compound (88%) against dalton's ascitic lymphoma cell line at the concentration of 100 mug/ml.
dissemination of antibiotic resistant enterococcus spp. and escherichia coli from wild birds of azores archipelago.
antibiotic-resistant is profoundly important to human and animal health, but the  environmental reservoirs of resistance determinants are poorly understood, in particular in wild environments in remote archipelagos. moreover, the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in wild bird populations is rather unknown. in the present study, we used the azores islands as a model study for antimicrobial resistance in a remote archipelago, and examined the antibiotic resistance profile in enterococci and escherichia coli recovered from faecal samples of wild birds collected in this archipelago. a total of 138 enterococci and 115 e. coli isolates were analyzed for resistance to antimicrobial agents. of the enterococcal isolates, enterococcus faecalis was the most prevalent detected species (59 isolates), followed by enterococcus faecium (40 isolates), enterococcus durans (27 isolates) and enterococcus hirae (12 isolates). the enterococci strains showed high percentages of resistance to tetracycline (32.6%), to ciprofloxacin (19.6%) and to erythromycin (11.6%). lower level of resistance (<10%) was detected for ampicillin, chloramphenicol and teicoplanin. one vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis isolate was detected and harbored the vana resistant gene. resistance genes detected included tet(m) and/or tet(l), ermb in all tetracycline and erythromycin-resistant isolates. resistance in e. coli isolates was detected for ampicillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, streptomycin, and tobramycin. the blatem, aada, aada5, stra, strb, tet(a) and/or tet(b), and the inti genes were found in all ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim-resistant isolates respectively. the data shown in this study are essential to improve knowledge about the dissemination of resistant strains through wild birds from remote archipelagos such as the azores archipelago and the possible implications involved in transferring these resistances either to other animals or to humans.
correlations between income inequality and antimicrobial resistance.
objectives: the aim of this study is to investigate if correlations exist between income inequality and antimicrobial resistance. this study's hypothesis is that income inequality at the national level is positively correlated with antimicrobial resistance within developed countries. data collection and analysis: income inequality data were obtained from the standardized world income inequality database. antimicrobial resistance data were obtained from the european antimicrobial resistance surveillance network and outpatient antimicrobial consumption data, measured by defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitants per day, from the european surveillance of antimicrobial consumption group. spearman's correlation coefficient (r) defined strengths of correlations of: > 0.8 as strong, > 0.5 as moderate and > 0.2 as weak. confidence intervals and p values were defined for all r values. correlations were calculated for the time period 2003-10, for 15 european countries. results: income inequality and antimicrobial resistance correlations which were moderate or strong, with 95% confidence intervals > 0, included the following. enterococcus faecalis resistance to aminopenicillins, vancomycin and high level gentamicin was moderately associated with income inequality (r= >/=0.54 for all three antimicrobials). escherichia coli resistance to aminoglycosides, aminopenicillins, third generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones was moderately-strongly associated with income inequality (r= >/=0.7 for all four antimicrobials). klebsiella pneumoniae resistance to third generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones was moderately associated with income inequality (r= >/=0.5 for all three antimicrobials). staphylococcus aureus methicillin resistance and income inequality were strongly associated (r=0.87). conclusion: as income inequality increases in european countries so do the rates of antimicrobial resistance for bacteria including e. faecalis, e. coli, k. pneumoniae and s. aureus. further studies are needed to confirm these findings outside europe and investigate the processes that could causally link income inequality and antimicrobial resistance.
czech ethanol-free propolis extract displays inhibitory activity against a broad  spectrum of bacterial and fungal pathogens.
propolis acts primarily as a biocide against invasive bacteria and fungi in the hive, suggesting its potential for industrial applications. in food application, propolis is considered as a chemical preservative in meat products, extending shelf life of frozen meat and other food. the mechanism of action is still unclear due to the synergy of multiple compounds contained in propolis and due to parallel targeting of multiple pathways within each affected organism. here, we examined the antimicrobial properties of dimethylsulfoxide (dmso) czech propolis extract. until recently, dmso was only rarely used in the propolis studies, although the other solvents tested (mostly ethanol) may significantly affect the observed inhibitory effects, notwithstanding the antimicrobial effects of ethanol itself. here, we provide results of zone inhibition tests against aspergillus fumigatus, microsporum gypseum, microsporum canis, candida albicans, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, and enterococcus faecalis. although we determined inhibitory effects against all the microorganisms tested, the dose-dependent response curves were not similar to each other. while inhibitory effects against c. albicans or s. aureus were strictly dose-dependent, responses of m. gypseum and e. faecalis displayed plateau across the broad range of concentrations tested. interestingly, response of e. coli revealed the double-peak dose-dependent curve, and responses of m. canis and l. monocytogenes decreased at the highest concentrations tested. suggested is evaluation of dmso propolis extracts in experimental treatment of human and veterinary infections, preferably in multitherapy with antibiotics.
nationwide surveillance of bacterial pathogens from patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis conducted by the japanese surveillance committee during 2009 and 2010: antimicrobial susceptibility of escherichia coli and staphylococcus saprophyticus.
the japanese surveillance committee conducted the first nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of uropathogens responsible for female acute uncomplicated cystitis at 43 hospitals throughout japan from april 2009 to november 2010. in this study, the causative bacteria (escherichia coli and staphylococcus saprophyticus) and their susceptibility to various antimicrobial agents were investigated by isolation and culturing of bacteria from urine samples. in total, 387 strains were isolated from 461 patients, including e. coli (n = 301, 77.8 %), s. saprophyticus (n = 20, 5.2 %), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 13, 3.4 %), and enterococcus faecalis (n = 11, 2.8 %). s. saprophyticus was significantly more common in premenopausal women (p = 0.00095). the minimum inhibitory concentrations of 19 antibacterial agents used for these strains were determined according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute manual. at least 87 % of e. coli isolates showed susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins, and 100 % of s. saprophyticus isolates showed susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides. the proportions of fluoroquinolone-resistant e. coli strains and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing e. coli strains were 13.3 % and 4.7 %, respectively. it is important to confirm the susceptibility of causative bacteria for optimal antimicrobial therapy, and empiric antimicrobial agents should be selected by considering patient characteristics and other factors. however, the number of isolates of fluoroquinolone-resistant or esbl-producing strains in gram-negative bacilli may be increasing in patients with urinary tract infections (utis) in japan. therefore, these data present important information for the proper treatment of utis and will serve as a useful reference for future surveillance studies.
antimicrobial activity of pleurocidin is retained in plc-2, a c-terminal 12-amino acid fragment.
an analysis of a series of five peptides composed of various portions of the pleurocidin (plc) sequence identified a l2-amino acid fragment from the c-terminus of plc, designated plc-2, as the smallest fragment that retained a antimicrobial activity comparable to that of the parent compound. mic tests in vitro with low-ionic-strength medium showed that plc-2 has potent activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus but not against enterococcus faecalis. the antifungal activity of the synthetic peptides against phytopathogenic fungi, such as fusarium oxysporum, colletotrichum sp., aspergillus niger and alternaria sp., also identified plc-2 as a biologically active peptide. microscopy studies of fluorescently stained fungi treated with plc-2 demonstrated that cytoplasmic and nuclear membranes were compromised in all strains of phytopathogenic fungi tested. together, these results identify plc-2 as a potential antimicrobial agent with similar properties to its parent compound, pleurocidin. in addition, it demonstrated that the khvgkaalthyl residues are critical for the antimicrobial activity described for pleurocidin.
design, synthesis and antimicrobial activity of novel benzothiazole analogs.
in an attempt to design and synthesize a new class of antimicrobials, dialkyne substituted 2-aminobenzothiazole was reacted with various substituted aryl azides to generate a small library of 20 compounds (3a-t) by click chemistry. structures of the newly synthesized compounds were established on the basis of spectral data. these compounds were screened for their antibacterial activity against gram+ bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis), gram- bacteria (salmonella typhi, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, shigella boydii) and antifungal activity against candida tropicalis, candida albicans, candida krusei, cryptococcus neoformans) as well as molds (aspergillus niger, aspergillus fumigatus). the compound 3e showed maximum potency against all gram+/gram- bacterial strains with mic value 3.12 mug/ml, which is two fold more active as compared to standard drug ciprofloxacin (mic 6.25 mug/ml). however, all compounds were found ineffective against s. boydii (clinical isolate). further, only one compound 3n was found to be the most active against all fungal strains with mic value in the range of 1.56 mug/ml-12.5 mug/ml while the remaining compounds showed moderate to weak antifungal activity.
antimicrobial activity and hydrophobicity of edible whey protein isolate films formulated with nisin and/or glucose oxidase.
the use of edible antimicrobial films has been reported as a means to improve food shelf life through gradual releasing of antimicrobial compounds on the food surface. this work reports the study on the incorporation of 2 antimicrobial agents, nisin (n), and/or glucose oxidase (go), into the matrix of whey protein isolate (wpi) films at ph 5.5 and 8.5. the antimicrobial activity of the edible films was evaluated against listeria innocua (atcc 33090), brochothrix thermosphacta (ncib10018), escherichia coli (jmp101), and enterococcus faecalis (mxvk22). in addition, the antimicrobial activity was related to the hydrophobicity and water solubility of the wpi films. the greatest antibacterial activity was observed in wpi films containing only go. the combined addition of n and go resulted in films with lower antimicrobial activity than films with n or go alone. in most cases, a ph effect was observed as greater antimicrobial response at ph 5.5 as well as higher film matrix hydrophobicity. wpi films supplemented with go can be used in coating systems suitable for food preservation.
preparation of some eco-friendly corrosion inhibitors having antibacterial activity from sea food waste.
chitosan is one of the important biopolymers and it is extracted from exoskeletons of crustaceans in sea food waste. it is a suitable eco-friendly carbon steel corrosion inhibitor in acid media; the deacetylation degree of prepared chitosan is more than 85.16 %, and the molecular weight average is 109 kda. chitosan was modified to 2-n,n-diethylbenzene ammonium chloride n-oxoethyl chitosan (compound i), and 12-ammonium chloride n-oxododecan chitosan (compound ii) as soluble water derivatives. the corrosion inhibition efficiency for carbon steel of compound (i) in 1 m hcl at varying temperature is higher than for chitosan and compound (ii). however, the antibacterial activity of chitosan for enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and candida albicans is higher than for its derivatives, and the minimum inhibition concentration and minimum bacterial concentration of chitosan and its derivatives were carried out with the same strain.
biological approach to synthesize tio2 nanoparticles using aeromonas hydrophila and its antibacterial activity.
nanosized materials have been an important subject in basic and applied sciences. a novel, low-cost, green and reproducible bacteria, aeromonas hydrophila mediated biosynthesis of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (tio2 nps) was reported. the resulting nanoparticles were characterized by ftir, xrd, afm and fesem with edx. ftir showed characteristic bands (1643 and 3430 cm(-1)) finds the role of carboxyl group oh stretching amine nh stretch in the formation of tio2 nps. the xrd spectrum confirmed that the synthesized tio2 nps were in the form of nanocrystals, as evidenced by the peaks at 2theta values of 27.47 degrees , 31.77 degrees , 36.11 degrees , 41.25 degrees , 54.39 degrees , 56.64 degrees and 69.54 degrees were identified as 110, 100, 101, 111, 211, 220 and 301 reflections, respectively. the crystallite sizes were calculated using scherrer's formula applied to the major intense peaks and found to be the size of 40.50 nm. the morphological characterization was analyzed by fesem and the analysis showed the nps smooth shaped, spherical and uneven. gc-ms analysis showed the main compounds found in a. hydrophila were uric acid (2.95%), glycyl-l-glutamic acid (6.90%), glycyl-l-proline (74.41%) and l-leucyl-d-leucine (15.74%). the potential glycyl-l-proline could have played an important role as a capping agent. a possible mechanism for the biosynthesis of tio2 nps has been proposed. the antibacterial activity of the synthesized tio2 nps was assessed by well diffusion method toward a. hydrophila, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis and showed effective inhibitory activity against s. aureus (33 mm) and s. pyogenes (31 mm).
microbiological survey of imported produce available at retail across canada.
increasing consumption and year-round consumer demand for fresh, minimally processed green vegetables have been observed in canada and other developed countries. however, in the past two decades, produce has been increasingly implicated in outbreaks and correspondingly recognized as a vector for the transmission of pathogenic microorganisms. to this end, we examined the microbiological quality of imported produce available at retail across canada during a period of limited domestic availability. in total, 106 samples obtained from five canadian cities were purchased from retail outlets and subjected to microbiological analyses, including aerobic plate (apc) and coliform counts, and enrichments for enterococci, indicator escherichia coli, e. coli o157:h7 and salmonella spp. also, recovered enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium were screened for antimicrobial resistance (amr). overall, samples included herbs (n=61), leafy greens (n=25), and spinach (n=20) deriving from five countries (columbia, dominican republic, guatemala, mexico, and the united states [us]). apcs were consistent across commodities regardless of country, ranging from mean log10 cfu/g of 6.1 to 7.4, with no significant differences observed. excluding a single leafy green sample from guatemala, the lowest prevalence of coliforms was for mexican herbs (22.2%), with a high of 66.7% on us leafy greens. with the exception of spinach, concentrations of coliforms varied widely, ranging from undetectable to too numerous to count (>8.5 log10 cfu/g). of the commodities assessed, mexican and us spinach had the lowest coliform concentrations (undetectable to 4.0 log10 cfu/g). organic herbs and conventional leafy greens possessed significantly lower (p<0.05) prevalence of coliforms compared to conventional herbs and organic leafy greens, respectively. the most frequent recovery of indicator e. coli was observed for herbs, with 11.1, 8.3, and 3.7% prevalence observed in samples from columbia, us, and mexico, respectively. for spinach, 0 and 6.7% of mexican and us samples tested positive, while no leafy green samples from either country were positive. no e. coli o157:h7 or salmonella spp. were detected. e. faecium and e. faecalis were recovered from 15.1 and 5.7% of samples, respectively. although no glycopeptide resistance was observed, resistance to other clinically relevant antibiotics was noteworthy in both species. overall, though microbiological quality indicators were frequently high, e. coli o157:h7 and salmonella were not detected. however, the presence of resistance and reduced susceptibility to clinically relevant antimicrobials in recovered enterococci demonstrate imported fresh produce may serve as a vehicle for the transmission of antimicrobial resistance across national borders.
inactivation of enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli present in treated urban wastewater by coagulation-flocculation and photo-fenton processes.
the purpose of the current study is to evaluate the inactivation of three different kinds of bacteria usually present in municipal wastewater treatment effluents (enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli) using a coagulation-flocculation-decantation (cfd) process combined with photo-fenton treatment at ph 5. different concentrations of fe(3+)-h2o2 (0.4/25, 5/25 and 15/25 mg l(-1)), and h2o2 (25 mg l(-1)) were evaluated for 210 minutes under artificial solar irradiation in a solar chamber atlas suntest cps+. the results were compared applying the cfd process before or after the disinfection treatment. the results of the bacteria inactivation show that the highest rate was observed using cfd-photo-fenton treatment with 15 mg l(-1) of fe(3+) and 25 mg l(-1) of h2o2, obtaining the total inactivation of pseudomonas sp., a 5.64-log inactivation of enterococcus sp. and a 4.61-log inactivation of e. coli. in addition, turbidity and suspended solids decreased more than 90% with the combined treatments. the treated wastewater samples could be reused in urban, agricultural, industrial, recreational and environmental uses according to current spanish legislation (rd 1620/2007).
using rapid diagnostic tests to optimize antimicrobial selection in antimicrobial stewardship programs.
new advances in rapid diagnostic tests provide several collaborative opportunities for stewardship teams, particularly in processes where delay in the initiation of appropriate therapy has significant consequences for patient outcomes. rapid molecular tests enhance one of the key functions of microbiology laboratories, which is to produce accurate organism identification and timely antimicrobial susceptibility testing data. these data are used to guide the choice of antimicrobial agents for treating infections in individual patients, and the aggregate data (i.e., hospital's antibiogram) are used to guide empiric therapy for infections before the availability of the patient's culture results and antimicrobial susceptibility testing data. in addition, accurate antimicrobial susceptibility testing data are critical for the overall success of a health care institution's antimicrobial stewardship program. tests that provide accurate organism identification and antimicrobial susceptibility not only benefit the individual patient but also increase the effectiveness of antimicrobial stewardship programs. this review focuses on the use of molecular diagnostic methods to rapidly identify staphylococcus species, enterococcus faecalis,enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli,klebsiella pneumoniae,pseudomonas aeruginosa,clostridium difficile, and candida species from clinical samples and summarizes studies that describe the application of rapid diagnostic tests in antimicrobial stewardship programs.
behavior of escherichia coli o26:h11 in the presence of hafnia alvei in a model cheese ecosystem.
this study was designed to evaluate the capacity of three hafnia strains to inhibit the growth of an e. coli strain o26:h11 in an uncooked pressed model cheese, in the presence or absence of a microbial consortium added to mimic a cheese microbial community. inoculated at 2 log cfu/ml into pasteurized milk without hafnia, the e. coli o26:h11 strain reached 5 log cfu/g during cheese-making and survived at levels of 4 to 5 log cfu/g beyond 40 days. inoculated into milk at 6 log cfu/ml, all three tested hafnia strains (h. alvei b16 and ha, h. paralvei 920) reached values close to 8 log cfu/g and reduced e. coli o26:h11 counts in cheese on day 1 by 0.8 to 1.4 log cfu/g compared to cheeses inoculated with e. coli o26:h11 and the microbial consortium only. the hafnia strains slightly reduced counts of enterococcus faecalis (~-0.5 log from day 1) and promoted lactobacillus plantarum growth (+0.2 to 0.5 log from day 8) in cheese. they produced small amounts of putrescine (~1.3 mmol/kg) and cadaverine (~0.9 mmol/kg) in cheese after 28 days, and did not affect levels of volatile aroma compounds. further work on h. alvei strain b16 showed that e. coli o26:h11, inoculated at 2 log cfu/ml, was inhibited by h. alvei b16 inoculated at 6 log cfu/ml and not at 4.5 log cfu/ml. the inhibition was associated neither with lower ph values in cheese after 6 or 24h, nor with higher concentrations of lactic acid. enhanced concentrations of acetic acid on day 1 in cheese inoculated with h. alvei b16 (4 to 11 mmol/kg) could not fully explain the reduction in e. coli o26:h11 growth. a synergistic interaction between h. alvei b16 and the microbial consortium, resulting in an additional 0.7-log reduction in e. coli o26:h11 counts, was observed from day 8 in model cheeses made from pasteurized milk. however, e. coli o26:h11 survived better during ripening in model cheeses made from raw milk than in those made from pasteurized milk, but this was not associated with an increase in ph values. in vitro approaches are required to investigate the mechanisms and causative agents of this interaction. h. alvei b16 appears to be a promising strain for reducing e. coli o26:h11 growth in cheese, as part of a multi-hurdle approach.
in vitro antimicrobial activity of novel azaphenothiazine derivatives.
antimicrobial activity in vitro of a series of novel azaphenothiazine derivatives containing a quinoline moiety was investigated using gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa) strains as well as in candida albicans yeast. the examined compounds showed the highest activity against enterococcus faecalis and escherichia coli whereas activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa was the lowest. compound 1d demonstrates the highest activity against all tested bacterial strains. compounds 1c, 1h and 1k with various substituents (ch3, oh, nh2) at c11 position of the quinobenzothiazine ring, did not exhibit activity against any tested bacterial strain. only compounds 1m and 1n with long aliphatic chains at the quinoline nitrogen atom showed antifungal activity. correlations between antimicrobial activity and chemical structure of the tested compounds were observed.
comparison of rosco neo-sensitabs with oxoid paper disks in eucast disk diffusion antimicrobial susceptibility testing on mueller-hinton agar.
this study compared neo-sensitabs with oxoid paper disks using the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) disk diffusion antimicrobial susceptibility test on mueller-hinton agar. the eucast-recommended quality control strains (escherichia coli atcc 25922, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213 and enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212) (part i) and clinical isolates (part ii) were investigated. in part i of the study, 27 combinations of antimicrobial agents were tested on four quality control strains repeatedly up to 60 times and zone diameters of tablets and disks were compared. in part ii of the study, 351 clinical isolates were included to cover a broad range of species, as well as resistance mechanisms. in part i, four major deviations (>1 mm outside quality control ranges) were observed with neo-sensitabs. in one case with p. aeruginosa atcc 27853 (meropenem), there was a corresponding major deviation (2 mm) with the oxoid disk. the three remaining major deviations with neo-sensitabs were observed with meropenem (2 mm) in e. coli atcc 25922 and with ciprofloxacin (2 mm) and gentamicin (3 mm) in p. aeruginosa atcc 27853. for oxoid disks, there were only minor deviations (=1 mm outside quality control ranges) in these three cases. in part ii, there were six discrepancies, susceptible versus resistant, in 3,533 comparisons between the two methods with the clinical isolates. the rosco neo-sensitabs appear to be a possible alternative to oxoid paper disks for eucast disk diffusion antimicrobial susceptibility testing on mueller-hinton agar.
enterococcus and streptococcus spp. associated with chronic and self-medicated urinary tract infections in vietnam.
background: urinary tract infections (uti) are one of the most common infections  among women worldwide. e. coli often causes more than 75% of acute uncomplicated uti, however, little is known about how recurrent utis and indiscriminate use of antimicrobials affect the aetiology of utis. this study aimed to establish the aetiology of uti in a population of recurrent and self-medicated patients referred from pharmacies to a hospital in hanoi, vietnam and to describe genotypes and antimicrobial susceptibility of the associated bacterial pathogens. the aetiology of bacterial pathogens associated with uti (defined as >/= 104 cfu/ml urine) was established by phenotypic and molecular methods. enterococcus faecalis isolates were typed by multi locus sequence typing (mlst), pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. methods: urine samples from 276 patients suffering symptoms of urinary tract infection were collected and cultured on flexicult agar(r) allowing for detection of the most common urine pathogens. patients were interviewed about underlying diseases, duration of symptoms, earlier episodes of uti, number of episodes diagnosed by doctors and treatment in relation to uti. all tentative e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates were identified to species level by pcr, 16s rrna and partial sequencing of the groel gene. e. faecalis isolates were further characterized by multi locus sequence typing and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. results: mean age of 49 patients was 48 yrs (range was 11-86 yrs) and included 94% women. on average, patients reported to have suffered from uti for 348 days (range 3 days-10 years, and experienced 2.7 utis during the previous year). cephalosporins were reported the second drug of choice in treatment of uti at the hospital. e. faecalis (55.1%), e. coli (12.2%) and streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (8.2%) were main bacterial pathogens. mic testing of e. faecalis showed susceptibility to ampicillin, penicillin and vancomycin, but high-level resistance against gentamicin (48.1%). mlst revealed 12 sequence types (st) of which st 16 made up 44.5% and showed closely related pfge types. conclusion: the different aetiology of uti compared with reports elsewhere, where e. coli dominates, may be a result of chronic and recurrent utis together with indiscriminate use of antimicrobials. the similar genotypes shown by epidemiologically unrelated st 16 isolates in vietnam and elsewhere, suggest that e. faecalis st 16 might represent a globally distributed clone. treatment of uti with cephalosporins may select for e. faecalis as it is intrinsic resistant and further studies are needed to establish the source(s) and role of e. faecalis st 16 in acute uti.
the changing epidemiology of bacteraemias in europe: trends from the european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system.
we investigated bacteraemia trends for five major bacterial pathogens, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, and determined how expanding antimicrobial resistance influenced the total burden of bacteraemias in europe. aetiological fractions of species and antibiotic phenotypes were extracted from the european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system (earss) database for laboratories, which consistently reported between 2002 and 2008. trend analyses used generalized linear models. robustness of results was assessed by iterative analysis for different geographic regions. from 2002 to 2008, the overall number of reports increased annually by 6.4% (95% confidence interval (ci) 6.2-6.5%), from 46 095 to 67 876. in the subset of laboratories providing denominator information, the overall incidence increased from 0.58/1000 patient-days to 0.90/1000 patient-days (7.2% per year; 95% ci 6.9-7.5%). the frequency of reported bacteraemia isolates of s. aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae increased moderately, while increase in e. coli and enterococcus faecium was more pronounced. bacteraemias caused by methicillin-resistant s. aureus increased until 2005 (7.6% per year; 95% ci 6.1-9.1%), and then decreased (-4.8% per year; 95% ci -6.1 to -3.5%), whereas the number attributable to methicillin-sensitive s. aureus increased continuously (3.4% per year; 95% ci 3.0-3.7). increasing rates of e. coli were mainly caused by antibiotic-resistant phenotypes. our data suggest that the burden of bacterial bloodstream infection has been increasing for all species during earss surveillance. trends were mainly driven by resistant strains and clearly dissociated between resistant and susceptible isolates. it appears that infections with resistant clones add to rather than replace infections caused by susceptible bacteria. as a consequence, expansion of antibiotic resistance creates an additional strain on healthcare systems.
impact of ph on activity of trimethoprim, fosfomycin, amikacin, colistin and ertapenem in human urine.
objective: although major impairment of activity at lower ph values has been reported for fluoroquinolones, acidification is a widely recommended practice for the prophylaxis and treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (utis). until now, there is little evidence for the influence of ph on the activity on other antimicrobial classes in urine. methods: bacterial growth curves of staphylococcus aureus (atcc 29213), klebsiella oxytoca (atcc 700324), proteus mirabilis (atcc 14153), escherichia coli (atcc 25922) and enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212) were performed in mueller-hinton broth and in pooled human urine with a ph of between 5.0 and 8.0. bacterial killing of trimethoprim, fosfomycin, amikacin, colistin and ertapenem against the five strains (where appropriate) was determined consecutively at concentrations equal to the mic. results: while no difference in the bacterial growth of e. coli, s. aureus, p. mirabilis and k. oxytoca was observed at different ph values, bacterial growth of e. faecalis was significantly reduced at low ph. acidification to ph 5 impaired the antimicrobial activity of all investigated antibiotics, i.e. the net effect of bacterial growth and killing resulted in increased colony-forming units/ml at the end of the experiment. conclusion: the present in vitro findings indicate that acidification of urine during the treatment of utis should be carefully considered. while growth curves of one strain supports the concept of therapeutic or prophylactic acidification during utis, the most common pathogen, e. coli, was not affected by low ph. independent of the investigated strain or antibiotic, ph values below 6 lead to a reduction of antimicrobial activity.
synergistic bactericidal activity between hyperosmotic stress and membrane-disrupting nanoemulsions.
there is a clear clinical need for alternative types of non-antibiotic biocides due to the rising global health concern of microbial drug resistance. in this work, a novel antibacterial concept was delineated that utilized hyperosmotic stress (h) in concert with membrane-disrupting nanoemulsions (nes). the antibacterial effects of either h or a ne, as well as in combination (h+ne), were assessed in vitro using an escherichia coli model. it was found that exposure to h or ne alone produced dose-dependent bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects, respectively. however, the bactericidal action of ne was significantly amplified in the presence of h. outcomes following h+ne exposure included rapid efflux of k(+) and nucleic acids, increased membrane permeability and a reduction in both intracellular atp and cell viability. further inspection of morphology by electron microscopy highlighted cell shrinkage, membrane dissolution and bacteriolysis. pathogen inactivation occurred immediately upon contact with h+ne. the effects of h, ne and h+ne against enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and meticillin-resistant s. aureus isolates were also examined. similar to the escherichia coli model, h+ne showed antibacterial synergism in these organisms when classified by the chou-talalay combination index for two-agent interactions. this synergistic interaction suggests that the h+ne platform may potentially serve as a new paradigm in disinfectants, antiseptics and antibacterial wound dressings. the h+ne mechanism of action was termed osmopermeation, as a descriptor for the underlying inactivation process.
in vivo exposure of mytilus edulis to living enteric bacteria: a threat for immune competency?
mussels are widespread in coastal environments and experience various physical, chemical, and bacteriological conditions. owing to the increase of coastal urbanization, mussels are now commonly exposed not only to indigenous bacteria, but also to enteric bacteria originating from pulsed and chronic sewage discharges into coastal environments. due to its broad resilience to environmental variations, the blue mussel mytilus edulis is commonly used as an indicator of environmental quality in bio-monitoring programs. however, since mussel immune system capabilities may be affected by the presence of exogenous fecal bacteria in coastal seawater subjected to sewage discharges, we aimed to determine the effect of in vivo bacterial challenges on mussels' immune competency by using two exogenous enteric bacterial strains, escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis, and an indigenous bacterial strain vibrio splendidus (as control). bacterial strains were tested individually, by injection into the posterior adductor muscle at three different cell densities (10(2), 10(3), and 10(4) cells). unlike classic in vitro experiments using higher bacterial concentrations, neither the enteric bacteria nor the indigenous strain induced significant increase or decrease of either cell-mediated (phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species, and no(x) production) or humoral components (prophenoloxidase-like, acid phosphatase, and l-leucine-aminopeptidase production) of the immune system. this study demonstrates that, at low concentrations, e. coli and e. faecalis do not represent an additional threat that could impair m. edulis immune competency and, as a consequence, its potential of survival in coastal areas subjected to sewage discharges.
monitoring of antibiotic resistance in bacteria isolated from laboratory animals.
the drug resistance of microorganisms isolated from laboratory animals never treated with antibiotics is being reported consistently, while the number of laboratory animals used in medicine, pharmacy, veterinary medicine, agriculture, nutrition, and environmental and health science has increased rapidly in korea. therefore, this study examined the development of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from laboratory animals bred in korea. a total of 443 isolates (7 species) containing 5 sphingomonas paucimobilis, 206 escherichia coli, 60 staphylococcus aureus, 15 staphylococcus epidermidis, 77 enterococcus faecalis, 27 citrobacter freundii, 35 acinetobacter baumannii were collected from the nose, intestine, bronchus and reproductive organs of icr mice and sd rats. of these species, acinetobacter baumannii and enterococcus faecalis showed significant antimicrobial resistance according to the minimum inhibition concentration (mic) in e-test. in case of acinetobacter baumannii, several isolates showed mic values 16-128 microg/ml for cefazolin and cefoxitin, and higher resistance (128-512 microg/ml) to nitrofurantoin than that of standard type. resistance to cefazolin, cefoxitin and nitrofurantoin was detected in 17.14, 20.00, and 8.57% of the acinetobacter baumannii isolates, respectively. in addition, 44.1% of the enterococcus faecalis isolates collected from the laboratory animals were resistant to oxacillin concentration of 16-32 microg/ml range, while mic value of standard type was below oxacillin concentration of 6 microg/ml. these results suggest that in rodent species of laboratory animals, acinetobacter baumannii are resistance to cefazolin, cefoxitin and nitrofurantoin, whereas those of enterococcus faecalis were resistance to oxacillin.
evaluation of impact of exposure of sudan azo dyes and their metabolites on human intestinal bacteria.
sudan azo dyes are banned for food usage in most countries, but they are illegally used to maintain or enhance the color of food products due to low cost, bright staining, and wide availability of the dyes. in this report, we examined the toxic effects of these azo dyes and their potential reduction metabolites on 11 prevalent human intestinal bacterial strains. among the tested bacteria, cell growth of 2, 3, 5, 5, and 1 strains was inhibited by sudan i, ii, iii, iv, and para red, respectively. at the tested concentration of 100 mum, sudan i and ii inhibited growth of clostridium perfringens and lactobacillus rhamnosus with decrease of growth rates from 14 to 47%. sudan ii also affected growth of enterococcus faecalis. growth of bifidobacterium catenulatum, c. perfringens, e. faecalis, escherichia coli, and peptostreptococcus magnus was affected by sudan iii and iv with decrease in growth rates from 11 to 67%. c. perfringens was the only strain in which growth was affected by para red with 47 and 26% growth decreases at 6 and 10 h, respectively. 1-amino-2-naphthol, a common metabolite of the dyes, was capable of inhibiting growth of most of the tested bacteria with inhibition rates from 8 to 46%. however, the other metabolites of the dyes had no effect on growth of the bacterial strains. the dyes and their metabolites had less effect on cell viability than on cell growth of the tested bacterial strains. clostridium indolis and clostridium ramosum were the only two strains with about a 10 % decrease in cell viability in the presence of sudan azo dyes. the present results suggested that sudan azo dyes and their metabolites potentially affect the human intestinal bacterial ecology by selectively inhibiting some bacterial species, which may have an adverse effect on human health.
the antimicrobial activity of the appetite peptide hormone ghrelin.
the present study examined the antimicrobial activity of the peptide ghrelin. both major forms of ghrelin, acylated ghrelin (ag) and desacylated ghrelin (dag), demonstrated the same degree of bactericidal activity against gram-negative escherichia coli (e. coli) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa), while bactericidal effects against gram-positive staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) and enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis) were minimal or absent, respectively. to elucidate the bactericidal mechanism of ag and dag against bacteria, we monitored the effect of the cationic peptides on the zeta potential of e. coli. our results show that ag and dag similarly quenched the negative surface charge of e. coli, suggesting that ghrelin-mediated bactericidal effects are influenced by charge-dependent binding and not by acyl modification. like most cationic antimicrobial peptides (camps), we also found that the antibacterial activity of ag was attenuated in physiological nacl concentration (150mm). nonetheless, these findings indicate that both ag and dag can act as camps against gram-negative bacteria.
gender and age-dependent etiology of community-acquired urinary tract infections.
urinary tract infections (utis) are among the most frequent community-acquired infections worldwide. escherichia coli is the most common uti pathogen although underlying host factors such as patients' age and gender may influence prevalence of causative agents. in this study, 61 273 consecutive urine samples received over a 22-month period from outpatients clinics of an urban area of north italy underwent microbiological culture with subsequent bacterial identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of positive samples. a total of 13 820 uropathogens were isolated and their prevalence analyzed according to patient's gender and age group. overall escherichia coli accounted for 67.6% of all isolates, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (8.8%), enterococcus faecalis (6.3%), proteus mirabilis (5.2%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.5%). data stratification according to both age and gender showed e. coli isolation rates to be lower in both males aged >/=60 years (52.2%), e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa being more prevalent in this group (11.6% and 7.8%, resp.), as well as in those aged </=14 years (51.3%) in whom p. mirabilis prevalence was found to be as high as 21.2%. streptococcus agalactiae overall prevalence was found to be 2.3% although it was shown to occur most frequently in women aged between 15 and 59 years (4.1%). susceptibility of e. coli to oral antimicrobial agents was demonstrated to be as follows: fosfomycin (72.9%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (72.9%), ciprofloxacin (76.8%), ampicillin (48.0%), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (77.5%). in conclusion, both patients' age and gender are significant factors in determining utis etiology; they can increase accuracy in defining the causative uropathogen as well as providing useful guidance to empiric treatment.
sensitivities of major causative organisms isolated from patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis against various antibacterial agents: results of subanalysis based on the presence of menopause.
we investigated whether the presence of menopause influenced the species and distribution of causative bacteria isolated from patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis (the most common urinary tract infection), and we also investigated the sensitivity of the isolated species to antibacterial agents. using multivariate analysis, we also investigated risk factors for infection with quinolone-resistant escherichia coli, because its frequency has increased and it is now a clinical problem in japan. six hundred and thirty-four strains were isolated from 489 premenopausal patients (mean age 32.3 +/- 10.1 years). major causative bacteria detected were escherichia coli (65.0 %), enterococcus faecalis (12.0 %), streptococcus agalactiae (5.5 %), and klebsiella pneumoniae (1.6 %). from 501 postmenopausal patients (mean age 68.7 +/- 10.29 years), 657 strains were isolated, and the major causative bacteria detected were e. coli (61.5 %), e. faecalis (13.7 %), k. pneumoniae (5.2 %), and s. agalactiae (4.0 %). the sensitivities to fluoroquinolones (fqs) and cephems of e. coli isolated from premenopausal patients were both >/=90 %, while the sensitivities to fqs of e. coli isolated from postmenopausal patients were about 5 % lower. in regard to infection with quinolone-resistant e. coli (minimal inhibitory concentration of levofloxacin [lvfx] >/=4 mug/ml), significant risk factors were observed in patients with more than two episodes of cystitis within a year (p = 0.0002), patients to whom antibacterial agents were used previously for this episode of cystitis (p = 0.0175), and patients who had a history of fq administration within 1 month. although the species and distribution of causative bacteria of acute uncomplicated cystitis were the same regardless of the presence of menopause, the sensitivities to fqs of e. coli detected in postmenopausal patients were significantly lower than those in the premenopausal women. the major risk factors for infection with quinolone-resistant e. coli were a history of fq administration and the morbidity of cystitis rather than the menopausal status. it was considered that taking an appropriate history including the morbidity of cystitis and history of fq administration, and the appropriate selection of an antibacterial agent, would be important when empirical therapy is required.
profile of antibiotic consumption, sensitivity and resistance in an urban area of andhra pradesh, india.
introduction: antibiotics are an important category of drugs in which indiscriminate use can affect the susceptibility patterns among infectious organisms, resulting in antibiotic resistance. methods: data on antibiotic usage and susceptibility patterns were collected from public and private health centres in vijayawada, andhra pradesh, india, through the use of questionnaires. the data collected were then coded, tabulated, computed and evaluated using statistical analysis. results: the consumption profile of the different categories of drugs used in public and private hospitals was as follows: nutrition and metabolism products 19.0%; gastrointestinal disorder-related drugs 18.5%; antibiotics 16.8%; anti-pyretics and anti-analgesics 20.6%. these drugs were found to be in high demand. among the antibiotics, aminoglycosides (amikacin), quinolones (ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin), tetracyclines (doxycycline), penicillin (ampicillin) and sulphonamides (co-trimoxazole) were the most commonly prescribed drugs for antibiotic therapy. 46% of the culture laboratory reports were positive with the following organism profile: escherichia coli (36%), klebsiella pneumoniae (16%), staphylococcus aureus (29%), enterococcus faecalis (9%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%). in terms of the sensitivity profile of antibacterials, amikacin (66.9%) was the only antibiotic showing sensitivity patterns, while the majority of antibiotics, such as cotrimoxazole, nalidixic acid, amoxicillin, gentamycin and norfloxacin, had acquired a resistance rate of 55.1%-80.6%. conclusion: the results of this study suggest that indiscriminate prescription and consumption of new broad-spectrum antibiotics against sensitive organisms results in the development of antimicrobial resistance. therefore, there is an urgent need to curb the excessive use of antibiotics in local hospitals in order to control the trend of increasing antimicrobial resistance to antibiotics.
antibacterial effect and cytotoxicity of beta-1,3-1, 4-glucanase from endophytic  bacillus subtilis swb8.
objective: we studied the antibiotic activity and selective cytotoxicity of beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase from endophytic bacillus subtilis swb8. methods: based on gel permeation chromatography, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry methods, protein fragments of beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase from endophytic bacillus subtilis strain swb8 were purified and identified. then, beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase was used to evaluate the antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, salmonella paratyphi a, shigella dysenteriae, candida albicans and cryptococcus neoformans and cytotoxicity against human pulmonary adenocarcinoma cells (a549) and human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (mscs) by using the disc diffusion, methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium and flow cytometry methods, respectively. results: bacterial beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase showed broad antimicrobial spectrum against all nine bacterial and fungal strains. furthermore, beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase possessed significant anticancer activity against a549 cells that the ic50 and ic90 values were 11.5 and 20.1 microg/ml, respectively. the percentage of apoptotic a549 cells treated with different concentrations of beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase was significantly increased from 4.43% of the control to 43.1% of 19.2 microg/ml glucanase in a dose dependent manner. in contrast, these changes could not be observed in human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. conclusion: beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase could be a potential source of desirable antimicrobial agent, or anticancer compounds with higher efficiency and lower toxicity.
relationship between urinary tract infection categorization and pathogens' antimicrobial susceptibilities.
background: urinary tract infections (utis) can be hard to treat and treatment plans need to include accurate categorization such as uncomplicated or complicated uti, or catheterized or uncatheterized uti. we investigated the antibiotic susceptibilities of representative uropathogens in uti categories. methods: we isolated uropathogens and analyzed their antimicrobial susceptibilities according to uti categorization such as: (1) urology outpatients, urology inpatients, or other department inpatients; (2) uncomplicated or complicated utis; (3) upper or lower utis, and (4) non-catheterized or catheterized utis. results: escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were representative uropathogens. susceptibilities to levofloxacin (lvfx) in e. coli in urology outpatients (p = 0.0179), those to ceftadizime in e. coli in other department inpatients (p = 0.0327), and those to lvfx in e. faecalis in complicated uti (p = 0.0137) significantly decreased in these 3 years compared with the previous 3 years. susceptibilities of upper uti to lvfx in e. coli were significantly lower in the recent 4 years compared to lower uti (p = 0.0452) and those of catheterized uti to lvfx in e. faecalis were significantly lower than in non-catheterized uti (p = 0.0153). conclusions: data demonstrated different tendencies of uropathogens' antibiotic susceptibilities according to uti categorizations and they could be useful for planning uti treatments.
colicin m hydrolyses branched lipids ii from gram-positive bacteria.
lipids ii found in some gram-positive bacteria were prepared in radioactive form  from l-lysine-containing udp-murnac-pentapeptide. the specific lateral chains of enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus (di-l-alanine, d-isoasparagine, and pentaglycine, respectively) were introduced by chemical peptide synthesis using the fmoc chemistry. the branched nucleotides obtained were converted into the corresponding lipids ii by enzymatic synthesis using the mray and murg enzymes. all of the lipids were hydrolysed by escherichia coli colicin m at approximately the same rate as the meso-diaminopimelate-containing lipid ii found in gram-negative bacteria, thereby opening the way to the use of this enzyme as a broad spectrum antibacterial agent.
pharmacological, genotoxic and phytochemical properties of selected south african medicinal plants used in treating stomach-related ailments.
ethnopharmacological relevance: the evaluated medicinal plants are used in south  african traditional medicine in treating stomach-related ailments. aims of the study: the study aimed at evaluating the pharmacological, genotoxic and phytochemical properties of the seven selected medicinal plants used for treating stomach-related ailments. materials and methods: ethyl acetate (etoac), ethanol (etoh) 70% and water extracts of the selected plant parts were evaluated for their antimicrobial and anthelmintic activities using microdilution assays. gram-positive bacteria (enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus), gram-negative bacterium (escherichia coli) and candida albicans were used for antimicrobial assays. caenorhabditis elegans was used for the anthelmintic assay. plant extracts were also assayed for their cyclooxygenase-inhibitory activity against cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 enzymes. the ames test was used to evaluate the genotoxicity of the plant extracts. a spectrophotometric method was used to determine the total phenolics, gallotannins, flavonoids and saponins. results: twelve extracts exhibited minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) <1 mg/ml against the bacterial test strains, and five extracts exhibited mic <1 mg/ml against candida albicans. the etoac extract of tetradenia riparia had the best minimum lethal concentration (mlc) value (0.004 mg/ml) against caenorhabditis elegans. all the etoac extracts exhibited percentage inhibition in the range of 50.7-94.7% against cox-1 and -2 enzymes at 250 mug/ml. all the plant extracts were non-mutagenic towards salmonella typhimurium tester strains ta98, ta100 and ta1537 without metabolic activation. phytochemical analysis revealed relatively high amounts of total phenolics, gallotannins and flavonoids in the evaluated plant extracts. conclusions: the general pharmacological activities exhibited by some of the plant extracts in this study support the traditional uses of the selected plants in treating stomach-related ailments. the ames test showed that all the plant extracts were non-mutagenic but cytotoxicity tests are needed to ascertain the safety for long-term consumption.
fate of pathogens in a simulated bioreduction system for livestock carcasses.
the eu animal by-products regulations generated the need for novel methods of storage and disposal of dead livestock. bioreduction prior to rendering or incineration has been proposed as a practical and potentially cost-effective method; however, its biosecurity characteristics need to be elucidated. to address this, salmonella enterica (serovars senftenberg and poona), enterococcus faecalis, campylobacter jejuni, campylobacter coli and a lux-marked strain of escherichia coli o157 were inoculated into laboratory-scale bioreduction vessels containing sheep carcass constituents. numbers of all pathogens and the metabolic activity of e. coli o157 decreased significantly within the liquor waste over time, and only e. faecalis remained detectable after 3months. only very low numbers of salmonella spp. and e. faecalis were detected in bioaerosols, and only at initial stages of the trial. these results further indicate that bioreduction represents a suitable method of storing and reducing the volume of livestock carcasses prior to ultimate disposal.
evaluation of wound healing and antimicrobial potentials of ixora coccinea root extract.
objective: to evaluate the wound healing and antimicrobial activity of root extracts of ixora coccinea (i. coccinea). methods: to investigate the wound healing efficacy of root extract of i. coccinea linn, five groups of animals were divided each containing six animals. two wound models including incision and excision wound models were used in this study. the parameters studied were tensile strength on incision wound model and in terms of wound contraction for excision wound model were compared with standard nitrofurazone (nfz) ointment (0.2% w/w). six extracts (ethanol, aqueous, petroleum ether, benzene, chloroform and ethyl acetate) of i. coccinea were screened for in vitro growth inhibiting activity against different bacterial strains viz, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus pumilius, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, salmonella typhi and pseudomonas aeruginosa and fungi candida albicans and aspergillus niger were compared with the standard drugs ciprofloxacin and chloramphenicol for antibacterial and griseofulvin for antifungal screening. the serial dilution and cup (or) well plate methods were used for the antimicrobial study and mic was determined. results: the ethanolic extract showed significant (p<0.001) wound healing activity when compared to standard drug nfz with respect to normal control group. amongst all, ethanolic extract showed highly significant antibacterial activity against all bacterial strains used in this study when compared to standard. the aqueous extract showed moderate significant inhibition against all bacterial strains when compared to standard. all the extracts were shown negligible activity against the fungal strains used in this study. conclusions: the ethanolic root extract of i. coccinea showed pronounced wound healing and antibacterial activity. the probable reason to heal the wound was that the external application of the extract prevented the microbes to invade through the wound thus the protection of wound occurs against the infection of the various organisms.
enhanced antibacterial activity of bimetallic gold-silver core-shell nanoparticles at low silver concentration.
herein we report the development of bimetallic au@ag core-shell nanoparticles (nps) where gold nanoparticles (au nps) served as the seeds for continuous deposition of silver atoms on its surface. the core-shell structure and morphology were examined by uv-vis spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (tem), energy dispersive x-ray (edx) analysis and x-ray diffraction (xrd). the core-shell nps showed antibacterial activity against both gram negative (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) and gram positive (enterococcus faecalis and pediococcus acidilactici) bacteria at low concentration of silver present in the shell, with more efficacy against gram negative bacteria. tem and flow cytometric studies showed that the core-shell nps attached to the bacterial surface and caused membrane damage leading to cell death. the enhanced antibacterial properties of au@ag core-shell nps was possibly due to the more active silver atoms in the shell surrounding gold core due to high surface free energy of the surface ag atoms owing to shell thinness in the bimetallic np structure.
dna, protein binding, cytotoxicity, cellular uptake and antibacterial activities  of new palladium(ii) complexes of thiosemicarbazone ligands: effects of substitution on biological activity.
the coordination propensities of 4(n,n')-diethylaminosalicylaldehyde-4(n)-substituted thiosemicarbazones (h(2)l(1-4)) were investigated by reacting with an equimolar amount of [pdcl(2)(pph(3))(2)]. the new complexes were characterized by various spectroscopic techniques. the structure determination of the complexes [pd(deasal-tsc)(pph(3))] (1), [pd(deasal-mtsc)(pph(3))] (2) and [pd(deasal-etsc)(pph(3))] (3) by x-ray crystallography showed that ligands are coordinated in a dibasic tridentate ons donor fashion forming stable five and six membered chelate rings. the binding ability of complexes (1-4) to calf-thymus dna (ct dna) has been explored by absorption and emission titration methods. based on the observations, an electrostatic and an intercalative binding mode have been proposed. the protein binding studies have been monitored by quenching of tryptophan and tyrosine residues in the presence of complexes using lysozyme as a model protein. as determined by mtt assays, complex 3 exhibited a higher cytotoxic effect towards human lung cancer cell line (a549) and liver cancer cells (hepg2). ldh, no assay and cellular uptake of the complexes have been studied. further, antibacterial activity studies of the complexes have been screened against the pathogenic bacteria such as enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, mic50 values of the complexes showed that the complexes exhibited significant activity against the pathogens and among the complexes, 3 exhibited higher activity.
chemical composition and antibacterial activity of the essential oil of lantana camara var. moritziana.
the essential oil obtained from the leaves of lantana camara var. moritziana (otto & dietr.) lopez-palacios collected at rubio, tachira state, venezuela, was obtained by hydrodistillation in a clevenger trap (0.1% yield). the oil was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc/ms) on hp gc-ms system, model 5973, identifying 33 compounds (97.1%) of which the major components were germacrene d (31.0%), followed by beta-caryophyllene (14.8%), a-phellandrene (6.7%), limonene (5.7%) and 1,8-cineole (5.2%). evaluation of the antibacterial activity by agar diffusion method with discs against international reference bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhi, pseudomonas aeruginosa) showed growing inhibition of e. faecalis and s. aureus at mic of 350 mg/ml and 400 mg/ml, respectively.
antimicrobial susceptibilities of commonly encountered bacterial isolates to fosfomycin determined by agar dilution and disk diffusion methods.
we studied the antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin against 960 strains of commonly encountered bacteria associated with urinary tract infection using standard agar dilution and disk diffusion methods. species studied included 3 common species of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia; methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus; and vancomycin-susceptible and resistant enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. mics and inhibition zone diameters were interpreted in accordance with both the currently recommended clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) criteria for urinary tract isolates of escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis and the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) criteria for enterobacteriaceae. tentative zone diameter interpretive criteria were developed for species not currently published by clsi or eucast. escherichia coli was uniformly susceptible to fosfomycin, as were most strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. a. baumannii was resistant to fosfomycin, while the prevalence of resistance in p. aeruginosa and s. maltophilia was greatly affected by the choice of mic breakpoint. new tentative zone diameter criteria for k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, s. aureus, and e. faecium were able to be set, providing some interim laboratory guidance for disk diffusion until further breakpoint evaluations are undertaken by clsi and eucast.
in vitro assay of the antimicrobial activity of kephir against bacterial and fungal strains.
kephir is a fermented carbonated refreshing milk, with a slightly acidic aromatic taste and creamy foam composition which contains lactobacilli, leuconostocci, acetic acid bacteria, lactostreptococci and yeasts. recent studies have demonstrated its antibacterial, immunostimulating, antitumoral and cholesterol-lowering activities. purpose: the purpose of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial activity of kephir against bacillus subtilis spp. spizizenii atcc 6633, staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, escherichia coli atcc 8739, salmonella enteritidis atcc 13076, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 9027 and candida albicans atcc 10231. the kephir fermented for 24 h and 48 h, as well and after 7 days preservation at 4-8 degrees c was tested by in vitro disk diffusion method. the intensity of the antimicrobial activity was interpreted by comparison with two antibiotics, i.e. ampicillin and neomycin. results: the antimicrobial activity of 24 h as well as 48 fermented kephir, fresh or after 7 days preservation at 4-8 degrees c was similar and observed against b. subtilis, s. aureus, e. coli, e. faecalis and s. enteritidis. for e. coli, e. faecalis and s. enteritidis the antimicrobial activity was superior to both tested antibiotics and for b. subtilis and s. aureus to one antibiotic. the tested products exhibited no activity against p. aeruginosa and c. albicans. conclusion: kephir is exhibiting large spectrum and strong antibacterial activity probably due to the complex viable probiotic strains association producing antimicrobial substances.
impact of medicated feed on the development of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria at integrated pig-fish farms in vietnam.
integrated livestock-fish aquaculture utilizes animal excreta, urine, and feed leftovers as pond fertilizers to enhance the growth of plankton and other microorganisms eaten by the fish. however, antimicrobial-resistant bacteria may be transferred and develop in the pond due to selective pressure from antimicrobials present in animal feed, urine, and feces. in an experimental pig-fish farm located in periurban hanoi, vietnam, nine piglets were provided feed containing 5 mug of tetracycline (tet)/kg pig weight/day and 0.45 mug of enrofloxacin (enr)/kg pig weight/day during the second and fourth (last) months of the experiment. the aim of this study was to determine the association between the provision of pig feed with antimicrobials and the development of antimicrobial resistance, as measured in a total of 520 escherichia coli and 634 enterococcus strains isolated from pig manure and water-sediment pond samples. mic values for nalidixic acid (nal) and enr showed that e. coli and enterococcus spp. overall exhibited significant higher frequencies of resistance toward nal and enr during the 2 months when pigs were administered feed with antimicrobials, with frequencies reaching 60 to 80% in both water-sediment and manure samples. tet resistance for both indicators was high (>80%) throughout the study period, which indicates that tet-resistant e. coli and enterococcus spp. were present in the piglets before the initiation of the experiment. pcr-based identification showed similar relative occurrences of enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and other enterococcus spp. in the water-sediment and manure samples, suggesting that enterococcus spp. isolated in the ponds originated mainly from the pig manure. the development of antimicrobial resistance in integrated animal husbandry-fish farms and possible transfers and the impact of such resistance on food safety and human health should be further assessed.
in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate dressing on burn wound isolates.
objective: to test the antimicrobial effectiveness of a silver alginate dressing  on opportunistic pathogens, namely meticillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa) and meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), klebsiella spp., enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, enterobacter sakazakii, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, chryseobacterium indologenes, proteus vulgaris and acinetobacter baumannii. method: in total, 40 microorganisms were isolated from patients attending three burn centres in the us and evaluated for their susceptibility to a silver alginate wound dressing, employing a corrected zone of inhibition assay, conducted on mueller hinton agar (mha). results: the sizes of the corrected zones of inhibition varied between and within genera. for example, all acinetobacter baumannii strains were found to be sensitive to ionic silver at ph 7, with a mean of 2.8mm, compared with 3.5mm at ph 5.5. the silver alginate dressing also demonstrated activity on all strains of enterobacter and escherichia coli, with susceptibility to the silver alginate dressing enhanced at ph 5.5. for enterococcus spp. the average corrected zone of inhibition at ph 7 was 3.6mm, versus 4.9mm at ph 5.5. all strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were found to be sensitive to the silver alginate dressing. the average corrected zone of inhibition was 6.9mm at ph 7, compared with 8mm at ph 5.5. for mrsa and staphylococcus aureus, it ranged from 4.5mm to 7.5mm at ph 7. when the ph was decreased to 5.5, the corrected zone of inhibition increased. conclusion: this study demonstrates the activity of a silver alginate dressing on a wide range of burn isolates, including antibiotic-resistant bacteria, isolated from three different burn centres in the us. it also highlights the possible importance of ph and its potential effects on antimicrobial performance and microbial susceptibility. however, more extensive testing is required to substantiate this. conflict of interest: slp is employed by advanced medical solutions ltd.
lactobacillus fermentum isolated from human colonic mucosal biopsy inhibits the growth and adhesion of enteric and foodborne pathogens.
a number of lactobacillus species are used as probiotic strains in order to benefit health. we have isolated l. fermentum from human colonic mucosal biopsy samples that possess antimicrobial activities against entroinvasive and foodborne pathogens such as escherichia coli, salmonella paratyphi a, shigella sonnei, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vibrio sp. in addition to lactic acid, l. fermentum secretes antimicrobial proteinacious compound(s) that was found to be active even at neutral ph (ph 7.0). the compound was sensitive to heat treatment and trypsin digestion. lactobacillus fermentum inhibited the adhesion of enteropathogens to intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. isolated cell surface associated proteins (saps) from l. fermentum were sufficient for the adhesion exclusions of enteropathogenic e. coli. our results indicate that l. fermentum produces antimicrobial compounds and saps to inhibit the growth and adhesion of enteropathogens, respectively.
bacterial monocultures, propionate, butyrate and h2o2 modulate the expression, secretion and structure of the fasting-induced adipose factor in gut epithelial cell lines.
previous research showed that an intestinal microbial community represses the fasting-induced adipose factor (fiaf) in the gut epithelium, thereby increasing fat storage in the host. this study was designed to investigate the overall effect of different bacterial species and metabolites on fiaf in intestinal (caco-2, ht-29 and hct-116) and hepatic (hepg2) cancer cell lines. first, we showed that fiaf was present in different isoforms, and secreted as n-glycosylated proteins, exclusively at the basal side of the cell monolayer. second, co-incubation of cell lines with bacterial monocultures and metabolites altered both fiaf production and isoform appearance. propionate and/or butyrate treatment increased fiaf expression and cleavage in all tested cell lines. in contrast, different bacteria induced cell line-specific fiaf modulation. clostridium perfringens induced fiaf isoform changes in caco-2 cells. enterococcus faecalis and bacteroides thetaiotaomicron treatment resulted in cell line-specific fiaf increases, whereas escherichia coli significantly decreased fiaf expression in hct-116 cells. treatment with h(2) o(2) and peroxide-producing e. faecalis strains induced fiaf isoform changes in caco-2 cells. since bacteria and bacterial metabolites alter both fiaf production and isoform appearance, further investigation may reveal an important role for bacteria in fiaf-regulated physiological processes, such as cell differentiation and fat metabolism.
cytotoxicity, antiviral and antimicrobial activities of alkaloids, flavonoids, and phenolic acids.
objective: some natural products consisting of the alkaloids yohimbine and vincamine (indole-type), scopolamine and atropine (tropane-type), colchicine (tropolone-type), allantoin (imidazolidine-type), trigonelline (pyridine-type) as well as octopamine, synephrine, and capsaicin (exocyclic amine-type); the flavonoid derivatives quercetin, apigenin, genistein, naringin, silymarin, and silibinin; and the phenolic acids namely gallic acid, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and quinic acid, were tested for their in vitro antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal activities and cytotoxicity. materials and methods: antiviral activity of the compounds was tested against dna virus herpes simplex type 1 and rna virus parainfluenza (type-3). cytotoxicity of the compounds was determined using madin-darby bovine kidney and vero cell lines, and their cytopathogenic effects were expressed as maximum non-toxic concentration. antibacterial activity was assayed against following bacteria and their isolated strains: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and bacillus subtilis, although they were screened by microdilution method against two fungi: candida albicans and candida parapsilosis. results: atropine and gallic acid showed potent antiviral effect at the therapeutic range of 0.8-0.05 microg ml(-1), whilst all of the compounds exerted robust antibacterial effect. conclusion: antiviral and antimicrobial effects of the compounds tested herein may constitute a preliminary step for further relevant studies to identify the mechanism of action.
in vitro activity of ceftobiprole against frequently encountered aerobic and facultative gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens: results of the canward 2007-2009 study.
the in vitro activity of ceftobiprole was evaluated against 15 011 clinical isolates obtained from patients in canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. all staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ceftobiprole (mic(90)'s for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus of </= 1 mug/ml and 2 mug/ml, respectively). ceftobiprole was active against penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90), </= 0.06 mug/ml), penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90), 0.5 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic(90), </= 0.06 mug/ml), staphylococcus epidermidis (mic(90), </= 1 mug/ml), and enterococcus faecalis (mic(90), </= 1 mug/ml). over 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, and serratia marcescens isolates were inhibited by a ceftobiprole concentration of </= 1 mug/ml. ceftobiprole was not active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and k. pneumoniae. the in vitro activity of ceftobiprole versus pseudomonas aeruginosa was similar to that of cefepime (mic(90), 16 mug/ml). the broad spectrum of activity by ceftobiprole would support further study of this agent in the treatment of hospital-acquired infections.
triterpenoid saponins from symplocos lancifolia.
three new bidesmosidic saponins (1-3) and a new ursane triterpenoid, 2alpha,3beta,11alpha,23-tetrahydroxyurs-12-en-28-oic acid (4), along with seven known compounds, were isolated from a methanolic extract of the leaves of symplocos lancifolia. the bidesmosidic saponins were found to possess the same sugar unit part, composed of two beta-d-glucose moieties and one alpha-l-rhamnose moiety, linked to maslinic acid, arjunolic acid, and asiatic acid, respectively. their structures were elucidated by interpretation of their 1d and 2d nmr spectra and completed by analysis of the hresims data. the antibacterial activity of the isolated triterpenoids was evaluated against staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and several showed activity against gram-positive bacteria.
synthesis of 2-mercaptobenzimidazole derivatives as potential anti-microbial and  cytotoxic agents.
a series of novel 2-(1h-benzimidazol-2-ylsulfanyl)-n-(4-oxo-2-phenyl-thiazolidin-3yl)-acetamide 5a-j have been synthesized from various aldehydes and 2-(5-phenyl-[1,3,4]-oxadiazol-2-ylmethylsulfanyl)-1h-benzimidazole 6a-j from various benzoic acids. these compounds were screened for their in-vitro anti-bacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis as gram positive, klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli as gram negative bacterial strains and for in-vitro anti-fungal activity against asperigillus fumigatus and candida albicans. the in vitro cytotoxic properties were studied using brine shrimp bioassay. results revealed that, compounds 5b, 5d, 5g, 5i, 6b, 6e, 6f, and 6i showed excellent activity against a panel of microorganisms. the cytotoxic activities of 5b, 5g, 5i, 6b, 6f, 6h, and 6i were found to be good. all the newly synthesized compounds were characterized by elemental analysis, ir, (1)h-nmr, (13)c-nmr and ms.
analysis of the bacterial heat shock response to photodynamic therapy-mediated oxidative stress.
antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (pdt) has recently emerged as an effective modality for the selective destruction of bacteria and other pathogenic microorganisms. we investigated whether pdt induced protective responses such as heat shock proteins (hsps) in bacteria. using the photosensitizer toluidine blue o (tbo) at sublethal pdt conditions, a seven-fold increase in bacterial hsp groel and a three-fold increase in hsp dnak were observed in escherichia coli post pdt. pretreatment with 50 degrees c heat for 30 min reduced pdt killing in both e. coli and in enterococcus faecalis, with the most pronounced inhibition occurring at 50 mum tbo with 5 j cm(-2) 635 nm light, where e. coli killing was reduced by 2 log(10) and e. faecalis killing was reduced by 4 log(10). finally, inhibition of the highly conserved chaperone dnak using a small molecule benzylidene lactam hsp inhibitor potentiated (but not significantly) the effect of pdt at a tbo concentration of 2.5 mum in e. faecalis; however, this effect was not observed in e. coli presumably because inhibitor could not gain access due to gram-negative permeability barrier. induction of hsps may be a mechanism whereby bacteria could become resistant to pdt and warrants the need for further study in the application of dual pdt-hsp-inhibition therapies.
[antimicrobial potential of metarhizium taii in vitro].
objective: to investigate the antimicrobial potential of metarhizium tail and its corresponding active fractions. methods: the agar diffusion method and growth-rate assay were employed individually to measure the antibacterial and antifungal activities of m. taii. the microdilution and disk colony count was used to test the minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bacterial concentration. results: the extraction fractions of m. tail could evidently inhibi the growth of gram positive bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, gram negative bacteria such as escherichia coli, pseudomonas aerzginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis,and phytopathogenic fungi such as rhizoctonia solani, fusarium oxysporum, hereby m. taii had a broad spectrum antimicrobial effect including potent antibacterial and antifungal activities. the antimicrobial active ingredients of m. tail mainly existed in three extraction fractions including ethyl acetate extract in fermented broth, chloroform, and ethyl acetate extracts in mycelia. however there was an evident discrepancy on the antibacterial spectrum and competence for different active extraction fractions. conclusion: m. taii possess potent and broad-spectrum antimicrobial potential, and it is a good edible and medicinal resource for the functional food development and the discovery of new antimicrobial drug.
antimicrobial resistance in swiss laying hens, prevalence and risk factors.
antimicrobial resistance is an emerging concern to public health, and food-producing animals are known to be a potential source for transmission of resistant bacteria to humans. as legislation of the european union requires to ban conventional cages for the housing of laying hens on the one hand, and a high food safety standard for eggs on the other hand, further investigations about the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in alternative housing types are required. in this study, we determined antimicrobial resistance in indicator bacteria from 396 cloacal swabs from 99 swiss laying hen farms among four alternative housing types during a cross-sectional study. on each farm, four hens were sampled and exposure to potential risk factors was identified with a questionnaire. the minimal inhibitory concentration was determined using broth microdilution in escherichia coli (n=371) for 18 antimicrobials and in enterococcus faecalis (n=138) and enterococcus faecium (n=153) for 16 antimicrobials. all antimicrobial classes recommended by the european food safety authority for e. coli and enterococci were included in the resistance profile. sixty per cent of the e. coli isolates were susceptible to all of the considered antimicrobials and 30% were resistant to at least two antimicrobials. in e. faecalis, 33% of the strains were susceptible to all tested antimicrobials and 40% were resistant to two or more antimicrobials, whereas in e. faecium these figures were 14% and 39% respectively. risk factor analyses were carried out for bacteria species and antimicrobials with a prevalence of resistance between 15% and 85%. in these analyses, none of the considered housing and management factors showed a consistent association with the prevalence of resistance for more than two combinations of bacteria and antimicrobial. therefore we conclude that the impact of the considered housing and management practices on the egg producing farms on resistance in laying hens is low.
silver or nitrofurazone impregnation of urinary catheters has a minimal effect on uropathogen adherence.
purpose: bacterial adherence to the urinary catheter is an early step in biofilm  formation and the pathogenesis of catheter associated urinary tract infection. we studied in vitro the effect of silver or nitrofurazone impregnation of urinary catheters on uropathogen ability to adhere to urinary catheters. materials and methods: we studied commercially available nitrofurazone-silicone, silicone only, silver-silicone-hydrogel, silicone-hydrogel, silver-latex-hydrogel and latex-hydrogel catheters. catheters were incubated in sterile broth for 0, 3, 5, 7 and 10 days, respectively, before inoculation and overnight incubation with escherichia coli or enterococcus faecalis. results: adherence of e. coli and e. faecalis to nitrofurazone catheters was significantly decreased compared to that of silicone-only catheters when catheters were fresh. the anti-adherence effect of nitrofurazone on e. coli decreased with time but was still significant at 5 days. for e. faecalis the effect of nitrofurazone was lost by 3 days of pre-incubation. e. coli adherence was not significantly decreased on silver impregnated catheters compared to that on control catheters of the same base material. silver was associated with a significant decrease in e. faecalis adherence to latex-hydrogel catheters but not to silicone-hydrogel catheters. the adherence of each species to silicone catheters with hydrogel was significantly lower than that to silicone-only control catheters. conclusions: silver impregnation had little effect on bacterial adherence in our model and nitrofurazone impregnation had a significant effect only for the first 5 days. our results do not support a role for silver urinary catheters to prevent catheter associated urinary tract infection by decreasing bacterial adherence.
[etiology and sensitivity of uropathogens identified in uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections in women (aresc study): implications on empiric therapy].
background and objective: to determine the etiology and susceptibility of uropathogens identified in women with uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections (uti). patients and methods: in a multicenter study (aresc) in 9 spanish hospitals, 803 female patients with uncomplicated cystitis were consecutively enrolled and evaluated to identify the uropathogens and their susceptibility to 9 antimicrobials. results: of 803 patients with uncomplicated cystitis, 784 patients were included. a positive urine culture was found in 87.7% of the samples. of the 650 pathogens isolated, escherichia coli (e. coli) was the most frequent (79.2%) followed by staphylococcus saprophyticus (4.4%), proteus mirabilis (4.3%), enterococcus faecalis (3.2%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (2.3%). e. coli showed a high rate of susceptibility to phosphomycin (97.2%), nitrofurantoin (94.1%) and somewhat lower to ciprofloxacin (88.1%). fluorquinolone resistance rates were higher among postmenopausal women (17 versus 10%). e. coli was highly resistant to ampicillin (65%) and cotrimoxazole (34%) and 25% of the strains were resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanalic acid and cefuroxime. conclusions: in spain, e. coli shows high resistance rates to widely used antimicrobial antibiotics. phosphomycin and nitrofurantoin have a high in vitro activity. taking into account practical aspects such as convenience (only one dose), and the influence of the amount of fluorquinolone use on enterobacteriaceae and other microorganisms resistance levels, phosphomycin trometamol represents the option of first choice for the empirical treatment of uncomplicated cystitis in women.
[evaluation of the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of microorganisms isolated from urine in the region of vale do sousa and tamega].
the urinary tract is one of the more common sites of bacterial infections, especially in women. urinary infection can be defined as an infection of urinary tract structures which occurs, generally, as a consequence of the presence or colonization by urine bacteria. the aim of this study was to determine the etiology of urinary tract infections and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents in the region of vale do sousa and tamega. from february 2008 to january 2009, 18653 urine cultures were analyzed. from these cultures 1037 were positive. from this total of positive cultures, 18,3% were from males and 81.7% were from females. in bacteriological positive tests, 23 different strains of microorganisms were found. it was verified that the most frequent microorganism was escherichia coli, followed by proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. for antimicrobial susceptibility it was verified that escherichia coli showed low susceptibility to amoxicillin and cotrimoxazole. proteus mirabilis showed good susceptibility to cefotaxime and low to cotrimoxazole, amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin. for klebsiella pneumoniae was found only a reasonable susceptibility to gentamicin and enterococcus faecalis showed amoxicillin susceptibility. pseudomonas aeruginosa showed low susceptibility to all antibiotics analyzed with the exception of the combination piperacillin/tazobactam. in conclusion, this study shows that escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and klebsiella pneumoniae are the three main microorganisms that causes urinary infections in the region of vale do sousa and tamega. therefore, the antimicrobial empirically used must have a spectrum against enterobacteria, because they are the most likely to be present in urinary tract infections acquired in the community. a periodic analysis of the susceptibility profile should be performed over time for each region in order to help in the beginning of the empirical antimicrobial treatment.
spectral, thermal and in vitro antimicrobial studies of cyclohexylamine-n-dithiocarbamate transition metal complexes.
transition metal complexes of the type [m(l)(2)] and those containing monodentate phosphines of the type [m(l)(2)(pph(3))] {m=ni, co, cu and zn; l=cyclohexylamine-n-dithiocarbamate; pph(3)=triphenylphosphine} have been synthesized. the complexes were characterized using ir, uv-vis, nmr spectroscopy, and thermal analysis (tga). the (1)h nmr, (13)c nmr and (31)p nmr showed the expected signals for the dithiocarbamate and triphenylphosphine moieties. the spectral studies in all compounds revealed that the coordination of metals occurs via the sulphur atom of the dithiocarbamate ligand in a bidentate fashion. thermal behavior of the complexes showed that the complexes were more stable than their parent ligands. the ligand moiety is lost in the first step and the rest of the organic moiety decomposes in the subsequent steps. furthermore, the ligand and their metal complexes were screened in vitro for their antibacterial activity against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhi, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacillus cereus and antifungal activities against aspergillus flavus, aspergillus carbonarius, aspergillus niger and aspergillus fumigatus. the metal complexes exhibited higher antimicrobial activity than the parent ligands. generally, the zinc complexes were effective against the growth of bacteria with zn(l)(2) displaying broad spectrum bacteriocidal activity at concentrations of 50microg/ml; and ni(l)(2) was more effective against the growth of fungi at concentrations of 100-400microg/ml under laboratory conditions.
molecular characterization of antimicrobial resistance in enterococci and escherichia coli isolates from european wild rabbit (oryctolagus cuniculus).
a total of 44 escherichia coli and 64 enterococci recovered from 77 intestinal samples of wild european rabbits in portugal were analyzed for resistance to antimicrobial agents. resistance in e. coli isolates was observed for ampicillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, streptomycin, gentamicin, tobramycin, nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin and chloramphenicol. none of the e. coli isolates produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls). the bla(tem), aada, aac(3)-ii, tet(a) and/or tet(b), and the cata genes were demonstrated in all ampicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol-resistant isolates respectively, and the sul1 and/or sul2 and/or sul3 genes in 4 of 5 sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim resistant isolates. of the enterococcal isolates, enterococcus faecalis was the most prevalent detected species (39 isolates), followed by e. faecium (21 isolates) and e. hirae (4 isolates). more than one-fourth (29.7%) of the isolates were resistant to tetracycline; 20.3% were resistant to erythromycin, 14.1% were resistant to ciprofloxacin and 10.9% were resistant to high-level-kanamycin. lower level of resistance (<10%) was detected for ampicillin, quinupristin/dalfopristin and high-level-gentamicin, -streptomycin. no vancomycin-resistance was detected in the enterococci isolates. resistance genes detected included aac(6')-aph(2''), ant(6)-ia, tet(m) and/or tet(l) in all gentamicin, streptomycin and tetracycline-resistant isolates respectively. the aph(3')-iiia gene was detected in 6 of 7 kanamycin-resistant isolates, the erm(b) gene in 11 of 13 erythromycin-resistant isolates and the vat(d) gene in the quinupristin/dalfopristin-resistant e. faecium isolate. this survey showed that faecal bacteria such as e. coli and enterococci of wild rabbits could be a reservoir of antimicrobial resistance genes.
linum usitatissimum (linseed/flaxseed) fixed oil: antimicrobial activity and efficacy in bovine mastitis.
purpose: in vitro antimicrobial activity and in vivo therapeutic efficacy of l. usitatissimum (linseed/flaxseed) fixed oil in bovine mastitis were investigated. method: in vitro antimicrobial activity of l. usitatissimum fixed oil was evaluated against a number of microorganisms by disc diffusion method and mic determination. the in vivo efficacy of the oil was evaluated in nine mastitis-affected cows divided into three groups (three in each group), following once-a-day intramammary infusion of oil, cefoperazone or an oil-cefoperazone combination for 7 days and by monitoring the california mastitis test score, somatic cell count and microbial count in milk samples. results: the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the oil against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae and escherichia coli was comparable to that of cefoperazone while the antimicrobial activity against enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus luteus and candida albicans, was greater than that of cefoperazone. in the in vivo study, the oil exhibited significant reduction in the california mastitis test score and somatic cell count in milk samples from infected udders following 7 days of intramammary administration suggesting its anti-inflammatory effect. the microbial count in milk samples was also reduced significantly following oil treatment. the effects were comparable to the treatment by cefoperazone (mastiwock) alone or in combination with the oil. apparently, the anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties of the oil contribute to its therapeutic efficacy in mastitis; the oil could be used as an alternative treatment for bovine mastitis conclusion: the results suggest possible therapeutic potential of l. usitatissimum fixed oil in bovine mastitis.
in vitro bactericidal activity of human beta-defensin 2 against nosocomial strains.
human beta-defensin 2 (hbd-2) is a 41-amino acid cationic peptide of the innate immune system that serves as antimicrobial molecule. we determined the bactericidal activity of synthetic hbd-2 against nosocomial strains belonging to eight different bacterial species and exhibiting various antimicrobial resistance phenotypes. the native disulfide connectivity was found essential for the bactericidal activity of hbd-2, while sodium chloride concentration was reversely associated with its potency. hbd-2 exhibited high bactericidal activity against acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus clinical strains. characteristically, a. baumannii strains that exhibited multi-drug resistant (mdr) phenotypes were susceptible to lower concentrations of hbd-2 (vld(90)=3.25-4.5 microg/ml) in comparison with non-mdr (wild-type) a. baumannii strains (vld(90)=3.90-9.35 microg/ml). bactericidal activity of hbd-2 was less pronounced against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis strains but was significantly enhanced against strains of these species that exhibited resistance to several beta-lactam antibiotics. these observations give indications that the natural hbd-2 has a potential therapeutic role against bacterial pathogens and particularly against those exhibiting mdr phenotypes.
defensin of the zebra mussel (dreissena polymorpha): molecular structure, in vitro expression, antimicrobial activity, and potential functions.
a 409 bp full length defensin gene was cloned and sequenced based on an expressed sequence tag (est) obtained from a normalized zebra mussel (dreissena polymorpha) foot cdna library developed in our laboratory. the d. polymorpha defensin (dpd) gene encoded a peptide with 76 amino acid residues. the mature dpd contains 54 amino acids with a fully functional insect defensin a domain. homologue searching against genbank database suggested that this dpd was phylogenetically close to defensins from a group of insects with six conserved cysteine residues. predicted with homology-modeling method, the three-dimensional structure of dpd also demonstrated a significant similarity with insect defensin a. the recombinant dpd was in vitro expressed through an escherichia coli expression system. the antimicrobial activities of the refolded recombinant dpd were found against the growth of morganella sp., plesiomonas shigelloides, edwardsiella tarda, e. coli and staphylococcus aureus aureus (atcc12598) with the minimal inhibition concentration (mic) 0.35, 0.43, 1.16, 6.46, and 30.39 microm, respectively. however, with less than 50 microm no detectable inhibition activities were observed against the other four gram-negative bacteria (aeromonas salmonicida salmonicida, motile aeromonas, flavobacterium sp., pseudomonas fluorescens, shewanella putrifaciens), as well as the other gram-positive bacteria (bacillus megaterium atcc14581, carnobacterium maltaromaticum atcc27865, enterococcus faecalis atcc19433, and micrococcus leteus atcc4698), and the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. the rna fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) of dpd in the zebra mussel suggested that the dpd was expressed in a variety of tissues, such as foot, retractor muscle, ctenidium, mantle, hemocytes, gonad, digestive gland, and intestine. by using the quantitative pcr, the expression level of dpd in the zebra mussel foot was the highest, followed by the muscle. by comparing the amount of dpd transcripts in the zebra mussel foot under two different byssogenesis conditions (byssogenesis and non-byssogenesis) with qpcr, we found that the higher expression levels of dpd were always associated with the byssogenesis status from 2 to 4 days after the start of byssogenesis. findings of this study suggest that the expression of the dpd gene was upregulated in vivo by byssogeneis, and by hemocytes in vitro upon stimulation with microbial antigens.
isolation of bacteriocin-like substances producing bacteria from finished cattle-manure compost and activity evaluation against some food-borne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria.
a finished compost sample was examined for bacteriocin-like substance production  against five pathogenic bacteria: salmonella typhimurium ef 85-9, escherichia coli o157:h7 atcc 43888, enterococcus faecalis jcm 8726, staphylococcus aureus jcm 2151, and yersinia enterocolitica jcm 7577. at the preliminary detection of bacterial strains exhibiting antimicrobial activity from the compost sample, thirteen strains could be isolated. screening of the inhibitory activity was done using agar-well diffusion assay and microtiter plate growth assay. six bacterial strains from the compost showed an antimicrobial activity against one or more of the tested indicator strains. four strains (m1-m4) belonged to shigella species and the other two strains (m5 and m6) belonged to salmonella species. the antimicrobial activity was sensitive for alpha-chymotrypsin and papain. the antimicrobial substances from m3, m4 and m6 were heat stable when heated for 15 min at 121 degrees c with 100% relative activity. the bacteriocin-like substance produced by strain m2 was partially characterized. it exhibited an inhibitory activity against the tested food-borne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria, except enterobacter aerogenes jcm 1235 and lactobacillus plantarum subsp. plantarum jcm 1149. it was stable at a wide range of ph (3-11). there was no loss of activity for up to 3 weeks when stored at 4 and -20 degrees c or for up to 2 weeks when stored at 28 and -80 degrees c. this is the first report indicating the presence of bacteriocin-like activity in animal manure compost.
essential oil from the underground parts of laserpitium zernyi: potential source  of alpha-bisabolol and its antimicrobial activity.
the composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil from the underground parts (roots and rhizomes) of laserpitium zernyi hayek (apiaceae) were investigated. the pale blue essential oil, obtained by hydrodistillation, was analyzed by gc and gc-ms. forty-three compounds were identified (94.3% of total oil). the main constituent, beside alpha-pinene (31.6%) was alpha-bisabolol (30.9%), so this oil may be a novel potential natural source of this sesquiterpene alcohol. the antimicrobial activity was tested using the microdilution method against gram (+) bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecalis), gram (-) bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli), and two strains of yeast (candida albicans). l. zernyi oil showed significant antibacterial activity against s. epidermidis, s. aureus and m. luteus, but lower activities against the other tested strains.
sewage sludge and liquid pig manure as possible sources of antibiotic resistant bacteria.
within the last decades, the environmental spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria has become a topic of concern. in this study, liquid pig manure (n=305) and sewage sludge (n=111) - used as agricultural fertilizers between 2002 and 2005 - were investigated for the presence of escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium. bacteria were tested for their resistance against 40 chemotherapeutics including several "reserve drugs". e. coli (n=613) from pig manure were at a significantly higher degree resistant to streptomycin, doxycycline, spectinomycin, cotrimoxazole, and chloramphenicol than e. coli (n=116) from sewage sludge. enterococci (ent. faecalis, n=387, and ent. faecium, n=183) from pig manure were significantly more often resistant to high levels of doxycycline, rifampicin, erythromycin, and streptomycin than ent. faecalis (n=44) and ent. faecium (n=125) from sewage sludge. significant differences in enterococcal resistance were also seen for tylosin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin high level, fosfomycin, clindamicin, enrofloxacin, moxifloxacin, nitrofurantoin, and quinupristin/dalfopristin. by contrast, aminopenicillins were more effective in enterococci from pig manure, and mean mic-values of piperacillin+tazobactam and third generation cefalosporines were significantly lower in e. coli from pig manure than in e. coli from sewage sludge. 13.4% (e. coli) to 25.3% (ent. faecium) of pig manure isolates were high-level multiresistant to substances from more than three different classes of antimicrobial agents. in sewage sludge, high-level-multiresistance reached from 0% (ent. faecalis) to 16% (ent. faecium). high rates of (multi-) resistant bacteria in pig manure emphasize the need for a prudent - cautious - use of antibiotics in farm animals.
antibacterial activity of root canal filling materials for primary teeth: zinc oxide and eugenol cement, calen paste thickened with zinc oxide, sealapex and endorez.
this study evaluated in vitro the antibacterial activity of 4 root canal filling  materials for primary teeth - zinc oxide and eugenol cement (zoe), calen paste thickened with zinc oxide (calen/zo), sealapex sealer and endorez sealer - against 5 bacterial strains commonly found in endodontic infections (kocuria rhizophila, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus mutans, escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus) using the agar diffusion test (agar-well technique). calen paste, 1% chlorhexidine digluconate (chx) and distilled water served as controls. seven wells per dish were made at equidistant points and immediately filled with the test and control materials. after incubation of the plates at 37 degrees c for 24 h, the diameter of the zones of bacterial growth inhibition produced around the wells was measured (in mm) with a digital caliper under reflected light. data were analyzed statistically by analysis of variance and tukey's post-hoc test (alpha=0.05). there were statistically significant differences (p<0.0001) among the zones of bacterial growth inhibition produced by the different materials against all target microorganisms. k. rhizophila was inhibited more effectively (p<0.05) by zoe, while calen/zo had its highest antibacterial activity against e. faecalis (p<0.05). s. mutans was inhibited by calen/zo, sealapex and zoe in the same intensity (p>0.05). e. coli was inhibited more effectively (p<0.05) by zoe, followed by calen/zo and sealapex. calen/zo and zoe were equally effective (p>0.05) against s. aureus, while sealapex had the lowest antibacterial efficacy (p<0.05) against this microorganism. endorez presented antibacterial activity only against k. rhizophila and s. aureus. the calen paste and calen/zo produced larger zones of inhibition than 1% chx when the marker microorganism was e faecalis. in conclusion, the in vitro antibacterial activity of the 4 root canal filling materials for primary teeth against bacterial strains commonly found in endodontic infections can be presented in a decreasing order of efficacy as follows: zoe>calen/zo>sealapex>endorez.
impact of a change in antibiotic prophylaxis on total antibiotic use in a surgical intensive care unit.
objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of reducing the length of antibiotic prophylaxis for cerebro spinal shunts on total antibiotic use and key resistant pathogens. methods: in january 2004, the use of antibiotic prophylaxis was reduced to a single shot dose with cefuroxime in an intensive care unit (icu). prior to this intervention, prophylaxis with second-generation cephalosporins was administered during the entire period of external cerebro spinal fluid (csf) drainage. the effect on the antibiotic use density (ad: ddd [defined daily doses] per 1,000 patient-days[pd]) was calculated prior to (january 2002-december 2003) and following implementation of the intervention(january 2004-december 2006) by segmented regression analysis of an interrupted time series. resistance proportions(rp) and resistance densities (rd), defined as resistant pathogen/1,000 pd of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis or e. faecium, third-generation-resistant (3gc) escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant pseudomonus aeruginosa, were compared by the fisher's exact test before and after the intervention. results: total antibiotic use by 147 ddd/1,000 pd decreased after the intervention when pre-operative prophylaxis was changed into single shot prophylaxis, from an estimated mean of 1,036 ddd/1,000 pd before the intervention to 887ddd/1,000 pd post-intervention. this decrease was primarily due to a significant reduction in the amount of cefuroxime used for prophylaxis. the reduction in total antibiotic consumption was sustainable, and it did not increase again during the next 36 months. the rr and rd of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant e. coli increased after january 2004, whereas the percentage of mrsa significantly decreased. conclusion: change to single shot prophylaxis along with an ongoing antibiotic stewardship program resulted in a cut-back in total antibiotic use amounting to as much as 15%. it would therefore appear that targeting interventions aimed at reducing antibiotic prophylaxis in surgical icus may be very worthwhile.
antibacterial activity of synthetic fire ant venom: the solenopsins and isosolenopsins.
background: we determined the in vitro activity of 9 synthetic fire ant venom alkaloids (+/-)-solenopsin a, (2r, 6r)-solenopsin a, (2s, 6s)-solenopsin b, (+/-)-isosolenopsin a, (2s, 6r)-isosolenopsin a,(2r, 6s)-isosolenopsin a, (+/-)-isosolenopsin b, (2s, 6r)-isosolenopsin b, and (2r, 6s)-isosolenopsin b against 6 species of bacteria (streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). methods: the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bacteriocidal concentration were determined in accordance with the clinical laboratory standards institute guidelines. time kill studies used american type culture collection bacterial isolates tested at 5 times the minimum inhibitory concentration. results: none of the venom alkaloids inhibited e. coli or p. aeruginosa, whereas all the alkaloids inhibited s. pneumoniae. only 4 alkaloids inhibited s. pneumoniae, s. aureus, and s. maltophilia. time-kill kinetics indicates that all 4 active alkaloids had bactericidal activity. conclusions: specific isomers of synthetic fire ant venom alkaloids have antibacterial activity against human pathogens.
chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the extracts of kefe cumin (laser trilobum l.) fruits from different regions.
structural properties (using gas chromatographic analyses: gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) of some compounds (pure chemicals, essential oils, extracts, etc.) and systematic investigation of antimicrobial activities (with agar dilution and agar diffusion disc methods) were determined in the fruits of kefe cumin (laser trilobum l.) obtained from different regions (germany, india, and turkey). the main components were established as limonene (41.03-72.24%) and perillaldehyde (4.23-32.75%) in the essential oils determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. mineral contents in the fruits were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer. it was determined that the fruits were rich in potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, arsenic and aluminium minerals. the highest sodium content was found to be 9,261.28 mg/kg in the samples obtained from turkey, but the potassium content of the samples from germany and india was higher than that of kefe cumin fruits obtained from turkey. the fruit extracts had a significant antimicrobial effect on pathogen bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus, proteus vulgaris (fmc 1), proteus mirabilis, bacillus cereus (fmc 19), aeromonas hydrophila (atcc 7965), enterococcus faecalis (atcc 15753), klebsiella pneumoniae (fmc 5), salmonella typhimurium, enterobacter aerogenes (ccm 2531) and escherichia coli (atcc 8739), whereas no significant antimicrobial effect of the essential oils was observed.
detection of antibiotic resistant e. coli and enterococcus spp. in stool of healthy growing children in portugal.
from stool specimens of 118 healthy children's (1-14 years) in portugal 92 e. coli and 101 enterococcu s spp. strains have been isolated. almost half (40.2%) of the e. coli isolates were resistant to ampicillin, 25.0% were resistant to tetracycline and 26.1% were resistant to streptomycin. resistance genes detected by specific pcr included bla(tem) and/or bla(shv) and/or bla(ctx-m) (33 of 37 ampicillin and/or cefotaxime resistant isolates), tet (a) and/or tet (b) (16 of 23 tetracycline-resistant isolates), aad a (19 of 24 streptomycin-resistant isolates), cml a (in the two chloramphenicol-resistant isolates), aac (3)-ii with/without aac (3)-iv (in the four gentamicin-resistant isolates), sul 1 and/or sul 2 and/or sul 3 (in all trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole resistant isolates). the majority of the resistant e. coli isolates (69.1%) belonged to phylogenetic group b2. of the enterococci isolates e. faecium (n = 53), e. faecalis (n = 41), e. hirae (n = 4) and e. durans (n = 3) more than one-fourth (28.7%) of the isolates were resistant to tetracycline; 21.8% were resistant to erythromycin and 8.9% were resistant to kanamycin. resistance genes detected by pcr in enterococci included aph (3)'-iiia (in all kanamycin-resistant isolates), aac (6') (in all gentamicin-resistant isolates), tet (m) and/or tet (l) (26 of 29 tetracycline-resistant isolates), erm (b) (17 of 22 erythromycin-resistant isolates). this survey showed that faecal bacteria such as e. coli and enterococci of healthy growing children's could be a reservoir of antimicrobial resistance genes.

a new series of novel 5-(nitro/bromo)-styryl-2-benzimidazoles (1-12) has been synthesized by simple, mild and efficient synthetic protocol by attempted condensation of 5-(nitro/bromo)-o-phenylenediamine with trans-cinnamic acids in ethylene glycol. screening for in vitro anti-tubercular activity against mycobacterium tuberculosis h(37) rv, anti-bacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae bacterial strains and anti-fungal activity against candida albicans and asperigillus fumigatus fungal strains were carried out. compounds 5, 7, 8, 9, 11 showed higher anti-tubercular activity and compounds 7, 8, 10, 11, 12 have proved to be effective with mic (microg/ml) and emerged as lead molecules showing excellent activities against a panel of microorganisms. all synthesized compounds were characterized using ir, (1)h, (13)c nmr, gc-ms and elemental analysis.
in vitro antibacterial activity of tigecycline against resistant gram-negative bacilli and enterococci by time-kill assay.
this time-kill study was performed with 65 genetically unique clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli and enterococci to further define the antibacterial activity of tigecycline. to our knowledge, this is the largest published time-kill study evaluating tigecycline activity to date. isolates evaluated were 10 meropenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii; 15 escherichia coli, including 10 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers; 15 klebsiella pneumoniae, including 10 esbl producers; 20 vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre), including 10 that were linezolid resistant; and 5 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis. time-kill testing was performed using tigecycline concentrations of 1x, 2x, and 4x mic with colony-forming units (cfu) per milliliter determined at 0, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. tigecycline mics (microg/ml) were < or =1 for e. coli and k. pneumoniae, regardless of the isolates' esbl production; a. baumannii, 0.06 to 4; 9/10 (90%) were < or =2; e. faecalis < or =0.12; and vre < or =0.25, regardless of linezolid susceptibility. in the time-kill assay, tigecycline significantly inhibited bacterial growth when compared with the growth control. the reduction in growth was <3 log(10) cfu/ml for all isolates, indicative of a bacteriostatic effect.
antiplasmid activity of 1'-acetoxychavicol acetate from alpinia galanga against multi-drug resistant bacteria.
ethnopharmacological relevance: alpinia galanga (l.) swartz is traditionally used in the treatment of various ailments across india, china, and southeast asian countries. in india it is a reputed drug in indigenous system of medicine and largely used as antibacterial and antiseptic. in southern india the rhizomes has been used as a domestic remedy against bacterial infections. aim of the study: to identify a potential antiplasmid compound from alpinia galanga against multi-drug resistant bacteria. materials and methods: the crude rhizome extract of alpinia galanga was prepared in acetone. antibacterial activity was checked by mic and antiplasmid activity was checked by sic. the principal compound responsible for the antiplasmid activity, in the crude extract, was identified by bioassay guided fractionation using hexane-acetone. antibiotic resistance profile of plasmid harboring strains and plasmid cured strains was determined by disc diffusion method. results: the crude acetone extract of the rhizomes of alpinia galanga exhibited antiplasmid activity against salmonella typhi, escherichia coli and vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecalis with an efficiency of 92%, 82% and 8% respectively at 400 microg/ml sic. the principal compound responsible for the activity was identified as 1'-acetoxychavicol acetate. 1'-acetoxychavicol acetate demonstrated the ability to cure plasmid encoded antibiotic resistance in various multi-drug resistant bacterial strains of clinical isolates such as enterococcus faecalis, salmonella typhi, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and bacillus cereus with curing efficiency of 66%, 75%, 70%, 32% and 6% respectively at sic of 400-800 microg/ml. conclusion: 1'-acetoxychavicol acetate mediated r-plasmid curing significantly reduced the minimal inhibitory concentration of antibiotics required to inhibit growth of bacteria, thus making the antibiotic treatment more effective.
murf inhibitors with antibacterial activity: effect on muropeptide levels.
murf catalyzes the last cytoplasmic step of bacterial cell wall synthesis and is  essential for bacterial survival. our previous studies used a pharmacophore model of a murf inhibitor to identify additional inhibitors with improved properties. we now present the characterization of two such inhibitors, the diarylquinolines dq1 and dq2. dq1 inhibited escherichia coli murf (50% inhibitory concentration, 24 microm) and had modest activity (mics, 8 to 16 microg/ml) against lipopolysaccharide (lps)-defective e. coli and wild-type e. coli rendered permeable with polymyxin b nonapeptide. dq2 additionally displayed activity against gram-positive bacteria (mics, 8 to 16 microg/ml), including methicillin (meticillin)-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus isolates and vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium isolates. treatment of lps-defective e. coli cells with >or=2x mic of dq1 resulted in a 75-fold-greater accumulation of the murf substrate compared to the control, a 70% decline in the amount of the murf product, and eventual cell lysis, consistent with the inhibition of murf within bacteria. dq2 treatment of s. aureus resulted in similar effects on the murf substrate and product quantities. at lower levels of dq1 (<or=1x mic), the level of accumulation of the substrate was less pronounced (15-fold greater compared to the amount for the control). however, a 50% increase in the amount of the murf product compared to the control was reproducibly observed, consistent with the possible upregulation of muropeptide biosynthesis upon partial inhibition of this pathway. the overexpression of cloned murf appeared to partly alleviate the dq1-mediated inhibition of muropeptide synthesis. the identification of murf inhibitors such as dq1 and dq2 that disrupt cell wall biosynthesis suggests that murf remains a viable target for an antibacterial agent.
real-time microgravimetric quantification of cryptosporidium parvum in the presence of potential interferents.
the quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (qcm-d) is used to develop a biosensor for detection of viable cryptosporidium parvum (c. parvum) in water matrices of varying complexity. in a clean environment, a good log-log linear response is obtained for detection of c. parvum in aqueous suspensions with oocyst concentrations from 3x10(5) to 1x10(7)oocysts/ml. c. parvum detection is slightly affected by the presence of dissolved organic acids, likely due to steric stabilization and/or masking of the antibodies/antigens by adsorbed molecules. colloidal contaminants generally have a greater influence as biosensor interferents, whereby the presence of model latex microspheres, enterococcus faecalis, or escherichia coli, led to decreases in biosensor response of up to 64%, 40%, and 20%, respectively.
leptoglycin: a new glycine/leucine-rich antimicrobial peptide isolated from the skin secretion of the south american frog leptodactylus pentadactylus (leptodactylidae).
antimicrobial peptides are components of innate immunity that is the first-line defense against invading pathogens for a wide range of organisms. here, we describe the isolation, biological characterization and amino acid sequencing of a novel neutral glycine/leucine-rich antimicrobial peptide from skin secretion of leptodactylus pentadactylus named leptoglycin. the amino acid sequence of the peptide purified by rp-hplc (c(18) column) was deduced by mass spectrometric de novo sequencing and confirmed by edman degradation: gllggllgpllgggggggggll. leptoglycin was able to inhibit the growth of gram-negative bacteria pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and citrobacter freundii with minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 8 microm, 50 microm, and 75 microm respectively, but it did not show antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus and enterococcus faecalis), yeasts (candida albicans and candida tropicalis) and dermatophytes fungi (microsporum canis and trichophyton rubrum). no hemolytic activity was observed at the 2-200 microm range concentration. the amino acid sequence of leptoglycin with high level of glycine (59.1%) and leucine (36.4%) containing an unusual central proline suggests the existence of a new class of gly/leu-rich antimicrobial peptides. taken together, these results suggest that this natural antimicrobial peptide could be a tool to develop new antibiotics.
regioselective synthetic approaches towards 1,2,8,9-tetraazadispiro[4.1.4.2]trideca-2,9-dien-6-ones of potential antimicrobial properties.
reaction of 2,5-bis(arylmethylidene)cyclopentanones 1a-d with nitrilimines (generated in situ via triethylamine dehydrohalogenation of the corresponding hydrazonoyl chlorides 2a,b) in 1:2 molar ratio proceeds in a high regioselective manner affording monocycloadducts 3 and dicycloadducts in the form of two isomers 4, 5. single crystal x-ray diffraction studies of the isolated crystalline form of 3c support the established structure and indicate that the formed product is 7e, 4s, 5r. antimicrobial activity screening of the synthesized compounds 3-5, utilizing a variety of gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus fecalis and streptococcus agalactiae), gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus vulgaris) and yeast (candida albicans), exhibited that all the prepared analogues acquire promising activities against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria especially compounds 3b, 4a (antimicrobial active agents against gram-positive bacteria) and 3c (antimicrobial active agent against gram-negative bacteria).
hylin a1, the first cytolytic peptide isolated from the arboreal south american frog hypsiboas albopunctatus ("spotted treefrog").
rp-hplc fractionation of the electrically stimulated skin secretion of the arboreal south american frog hypsiboas albopunctatus ("spotted treefrog") led to the isolation of a cytolytic c-terminally amidated peptide. this novel peptide, named hylin a1 (hy-a1), consists of 18 amino acid residues (ifgailplalgalknlik-nh(2)). the alpha-helical structure of the synthetic hylin a1 peptide was confirmed by cd spectroscopy in the presence of 60% (v/v) tfe. the synthetic peptide displayed broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria including escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa and also against fungi (candida albicans, c. krusei, c. parapsilosis and cryptococcus neoformans). hylin a1 was also able to disrupt human erytrocytes (hc(50)=18 microm). similarity analysis using psi-blast revealed 50-44% of identity to maximins hv, h16, h15 and h10 from bombina maxima and also to hylins b1 and b2 (hy-b1 and hy-b2) from hypsiboas lundii (synonym: hyla biobeba).
in vitro bactericidal activity of recombinant human beta-defensin-3 against pathogenic bacterial strains in human tooth root canal.
human beta-defensin-3 (hbd3), an endogenous antimicrobial peptide, has strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. this study aimed to obtain recombinant hbd3 (rhbd3) and to test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial characteristics of hbd3 may offer an advantage over conventional medicine in reducing intracanal bacteria. genetic engineering was used to obtain active rhbd3 and analysis revealed that it exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity at low micromolar concentrations against not only staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli but also against some critical pathogenic microbes in infected root canals, including fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella melaninogenica, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces naeslundii, enterococcus faecalis and candida albicans. in an in vitro antibacterial experiment, rhbd3 significantly eliminated pathogenic bacteria in root canals. the ratio of bacterial death was up to 98%. we conclude that hbd3 has the potential to eliminate bacteria effectively and rapidly in the local microenvironment of the root canal system and that it may contribute to successful endodontic treatment.
antimicrobial activity of essential oil and major constituents of salvia chloroleuca.
the aerial parts of salvia chloroleuca were collected at full flowering stage at  shahrestanak (tehran province of iran). the essential oil was isolated by hydrodistillation and analyzed by combination of capillary gc and gc-ms. thirty-four components were identified, representing 98.5% of the total oil. beta-pinene (10.6%), alpha-pinene (9.0%), beta-caryophyllene (9.0%), 1,8-cineole (9.0%) and carvacrol (7.9%) were the main components. the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of s. chloroleuca was studied against seven gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae) and three fungi (candida albicans, saccharomyces cerevisiae and aspergillus niger); the disc diffusion method and mic values indicated that the oil exhibited moderate to high antimicrobial activity.
in vitro antibacterial effects of topical local anesthetics.
background: the antibacterial activities of local anesthetics are recognized. objective: to investigate in vitro the activity of topical local anesthetic ointments at clinical doses. methods: the activity of two different local anesthetic ointments including lidocaine 5% and lidocaine/prilocaine 2.5% was tested against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis by the disc-diffusion method. sterile discs containing topical local anesthetic drugs were prepared taking into account the doses of ointments used in clinical practice. the validity of the methodology was confirmed using topical antibacterial mupirocin. the inhibition zones of the discs were measured. results: mupirocin inhibited all the bacteria. both local anesthetic ointments were found to be most effective on e. coli, whereas they had no effects on p. aeruginosa. lidocaine 5% revealed antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, e. coli, s. pyogenes and e. faecalis, but lidocaine/prilocaine 2.5% showed no activity on e. faecalis and inhibited s. pyogenes only at double doses. it was also observed that the antibacterial activity was in a dose-dependent manner. conclusion: in the light of these findings, it might be concluded that topical local anesthetic ointments in routine settings may have a preventive role against some bacteria.
heterologous expression of functionally active enterolysin a, class iii bacteriocin from enterococcus faecalis, in escherichia coli.
the heterologous expression of enterolysin a (enla), heat-labile class iii bacteriocin from enterococcus faecalis ii/1 with anti-listerial activity, was studied in escherichia coli. the pcr amplified products of enterolysin a structural gene, n-terminal part of enla with endopeptidase-like activity and c-terminal part of enla similar to a lysis gene of bacteriophage, were cloned in prelinearized pqe-30ua expression vector. the expression of enla structural gene led to the synthesis and secretion of functional-active his-tagged enterolysin a protein, which was purified to homogeneity using his-select cartridge and was shown to be fully active against the indicator strain. the expression of n-terminal or c-terminal part of enla and deletion of last 58 amino acids from c-terminal domain of enla led to the synthesis of biologically non-active proteins.
antibacterial activity of honey from stingless honeybees (hymenoptera; apidae; meliponinae).
the aim of the study was to examine antibacterial activity of the honey of stingless honeybees (meliponinae). an agar well diffusion assay demonstrated that many honey samples of stingless honeybees inhibited the growth of test strains of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa; moreover, they exhibited non-peroxide antibacterial activity against those strains. this is the first time that non-peroxide antimicrobial activity of honey from a number of species of stingless honeybees has been demonstrated. these antibacterial activities appear to be powerful, even when compared to those of"manuka honey" from apinae honeybees.
succession of dominant and antagonistic lactic acid bacteria in fermented cucumber: insights from a pcr-based approach.
the goal of the investigation was to study the succession of major groups of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and their antagonism in salt-fermented cucumber using pcr. in a direct detection method as well as a short enrichment process, pcr enabled detection of leuconostoc and lactobacillus during early hours of fermentation. subsequently, lactobacillus and pediococcus emerged as the dominant genera. nucleic acid sequence of culture-independent clones confirmed the detection of pediococcus as a dominant genera emerging during late stages of fermentation. pcr also revealed time-dependent emergence of mesentericin, pediocin and plantaricin a producers and accounted for the lab succession in the fermenting samples. a total of 328 lab isolates were obtained collectively from 30 cucumber samples, of which pcr could identify an overwhelming 186 lactobacillus isolates followed by 113 pediococcus and 29 leuconostoc isolates, respectively. based on antimicrobial assay against target strain leuconostoc mesenteroides nrrl b640, 28% of the lab were bacteriocin producers, of which pediocin producers were substantial, followed by plantaricin a and mesentericin producers. the bacteriocins elaborated by the isolates were active against a large number of gram-positive target lab strains and pathogenic bacteria including bacillus cereus, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus.
antibiotic pretreatment of hydrogel ureteral stent.
purpose: to compare bacterial adhesion to hydrogel-coated and uncoated ureteral stents. the antimicrobial activity of coated and uncoated stents treated with commonly used antibiotic solutions also was evaluated. materials and methods: hydrogel coated and uncoated stent segments were dipped in different antibiotic solutions (ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, and cefazolin). normal saline was used as the control. the segments were incubated in separate broths of escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis to reach the log phase. they were sonicated to free the bacteria, and colony-forming units were determined after 48 hours. to evaluate antibacterial activity, hydrogel-coated and uncoated stent segments were dipped in the above-mentioned antibiotic solutions. normal saline was used as the control. segments were incubated in separate mueller-hinton agar plates inoculated with e. coli or enterococcus faecalis, and the zones of inhibition were determined at 24 hours. the duration of antibacterial activity for each bacterium-antibiotic combination also was studied. results: hydrogel coating did not significantly reduce bacterial adhesion. zones of inhibition around stent pieces dipped in antibiotic solutions differed with the organism and the antibiotic. cefazolin produced a significantly larger zone of inhibition with hydrogel-coated stent, but the duration of antibacterial activity was similar to that of uncoated stent. hydrophilic coating significantly increased the duration of antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. conclusion: hydrogel coating on the surface of ureteral stents does not prevent or reduce bacterial adhesion. however, after antibiotic treatment, stents exhibit antibacterial activity in the local environment at greater intensity and for a longer time, depending on the bacterium-antibiotic combination.
diversity of bacterial isolates from commercial and homemade composts.
the diversity of heterotrophic bacterial isolates of three commercial and two homemade composts was studied. the commercial composts were produced from poultry litter (pc), sewage sludge (sc), municipal solid waste (mc), and homemade composts (thermal compost [dc] and vermicompost [vc]) from food wastes. the taxonomic and physiological diversity of the heterotrophic culturable bacteria was assessed using phenotypic and genotypic characterization and the analysis of the partial 16s rrna gene sequence. composts dc and sc presented the higher genotypic diversity, as could be inferred from the number of distinct genotypic patterns observed, 28 and 21, respectively. gram-positive bacteria, mainly firmicutes, were predominant in all the composts. some organisms related with taxa rarely reported in composts, as rhodanobacter spathiphylli, moraxella osloensis, lysobacter, corynebacterium, pigmentiphaga kullae, and new taxa were also isolated. the highest relative proportion of isolates able to degrade starch was found in compost sc (> 70%), to degrade gelatine in compost dc (> 70%), to degrade tween 80 in compost pc (> 90%), and to degrade poly-epsilon-caprolactones in compost dc (> 80%). compost mc presented the lowest relative proportions of isolates able to degrade starch (< 25%), gelatine (< 20%), and poly-epsilon-caprolactone (< 40%). when compared with the others, the homemade composts presented higher relative proportions of gram-positive isolates able to inhibit the target organisms staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, or pseudomonas aeruginosa. in compost mc, none of the gram-positive isolates was able to inhibit those targets.
the structures and antibacterial properties of nano-sio2 supported silver/zinc-silver materials.
objectives: the aims of this study were to investigate the structures and antibacterial properties of two kinds of sterilizing nano-sio(2) specimens. methods: the specimens were synthesized by adsorption methodology. one of them was synthesized by adsorbing silver cation onto nano-sio(2) carrier (silver-loading nano-sio(2) specimen (sls)), and the other one by co-adsorbing zinc and silver cations onto the same kind of carrier (zinc-silver-loading nano-sio(2) specimen (slzs)). chemical compositions of these specimens were estimated. the structure and morphology of the specimens were determined by x-ray diffraction (xrd) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (hrtem). also, the antibacterial properties of the specimens were examined. results: the amount of silver loaded in slzs was approximate to that of sls. consequently, it can be proved that the amount of nano-sio(2) adsorbed silver cation did not change with the addition of zinc cation. the obvious differences were not observed among the xrd patterns for each specimen. so it was possible to confirm no formation of new phase(s) after ag(+)/zn(2+) absorption. the loaded silver and zinc existed as nano-particles, as observed by hrtem. antibacterial properties of sls and slzs were excellent against escherichia coli and s. faecalis. the antibacterial effect of the same antibacterial agent against e. coli or s. faecalis was different. in addition, the antibacterial effect of slzs was better than that of sls. significance: these results suggested sls and slzs can be effectively incorporated in dental resin-based materials to provide antibacterial activity against bacteria.
role of a qnr-like gene in the intrinsic resistance of enterococcus faecalis to fluoroquinolones.
fluoroquinolones are poorly active against enterococci. recently, plasmid-borne resistance to fluoroquinolones due to the qnr gene was reported in members of the enterobacteriaceae family. the gene encodes a pentapeptide repeat protein that protects dna gyrase from inhibition by fluoroquinolones. we have identified in the genome of enterococcus faecalis v583 a qnr-like gene, named e. faecalis qnr (qnr(e. faecalis)), encoding a putative pentapeptide repeat protein that shares 25% identity with qnr. to assess its potential role in the intrinsic resistance of e. faecalis to fluoroquinolones, qnr(e. faecalis) was inactivated in e. faecalis jh2-2 by insertion of the thermosensitive vector pg1kt. this strain was then complemented with qnr(e. faecalis) cloned in the multicopy plasmid pori23. the effects of its overexpression were also studied. inactivation of the qnr(e. faecalis) gene resulted in twofold decreases in the mics of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. when the gene was complemented or overexpressed, mics of fluoroquinolones increased four- to nine-fold, leading to mics of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin equal to 32 mug/ml and 8 mug/ml, respectively. the e. faecalis qnr (qnr(e. faecalis)) protein was produced and purified. qnr(e. faecalis) protein protected escherichia coli dna gyrase from inhibition by ofloxacin. the qnr(e. faecalis) gene was then introduced into e. coli dh10b, staphylococcus aureus rn4220, and lactococcus lactis il-1419 to study its heterologous expression. mics of the various fluoroquinolones tested increased 4- to 16-fold, showing that qnr(e. faecalis) conferred resistance to fluoroquinolones in various bacterial backgrounds. overexpression of qnr(e. faecalis) in enterococci or mobilization of the gene to other bacterial species may be anticipated as a possible new mechanism for fluoroquinolone resistance.
mathematical models for conventional and microwave thermal deactivation of enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli.
temperature dependencies of survival fecal coliforms such as enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli in water were investigated between 25-65 degrees c. measured dependencies had "bell" shaped form with maximum bacterial viability at 35-45 degrees c. the rates of growth and decay of bacterial viability depend on specific forms of bacteria. at temperatures of 60-65 degrees c the number of viable bacteria decreased in one hundred times in comparison with the maximum value. similar "bell" shape forms were found for dependencies between bacterial viability and time of microwave (dielectric) heating of water. the dependencies had maximum value at 1-2 min of microwave heating. then, the number of viable bacteria decreased, and at 4-5 min of microwave heating, became insignificantly small. the proposed mathematical models for conventional and microwave heating took into account "growth" and "death" factors of bacteria, and had forms of second degree polynomial functions. the results showed good relationships (with coefficient correlation 0.84-0.99) between the proposed mathematical models and experimental data for both conventional and microwave heating.
application of real-time quantitative pcr for the detection of selected bacterial pathogens during municipal wastewater treatment.
bacteria were detected at five stages of municipal wastewater treatment using taqman(r) real-time quantitative pcr (qpcr). thirteen probe and primer sets were tested for diverse pathogens that may be present in wastewater, including aeromonas hydrophila, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, e. coli o157:h7, helicobacter pylori, klebsiella pneumoniae, legionella pneumophila, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella sp., and staphylococcus aureus. the sensitivity of the assay was 100 fg of genomic dna (=22 gene copies), based on a standard curve generated using a. hydrophila purified dna. samples from five stages of wastewater treatment were collected, including raw wastewater, primary effluents, mixed liquor, waste activated sludge and final effluents. in duplicate samples, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, c. perfringens and e. faecalis were detected throughout the wastewater process, and their numbers decreased by 3.52-3.98, 4.23-4.33, 3.15-3.39, and 3.24 orders of magnitude respectively, between the raw wastewater and final effluent stage. this qpcr method was effective for the detection of pathogens in wastewater and confirmed that the risk of exposure to pathogens in the wastewater discharge was well within the environment canada guidelines.
a new antibacterial compound produced by an indigenous marine bacteria--fermentation, isolation, and biological activity.
the use of microorganisms for biological purpose has become an effective alternative to control pathogens. a marine bacterium pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from eal fish of baluchistan coast of pakistan. this strain produced a bactericidal antibiotic against environmental and clinical isolates. in this study, we purified bactericidal antibiotic from the ethyl acetate extract of the cells of p. aeruginosa and analyzed its chemical structure. based on spectrometric analysis, this compound 1 is proposed to be 1-methyl-1,4 dihydroquinoline and is active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-sensitive s. aureus (mssa), salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, vibrio aliginolyticus, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter faecium but it is not active against g streptococci, candida albicans, aspergillus niger. minimal inhibitory concentration for gram-positive bacteria was between 50 and 75 microg ml(-1) and for gram-negative bacteria 75-100 microg ml(-1).
antimicrobial activities of some tetrahydronaphthalene-benzimidazole derivatives.
novel retinoid derivatives containing a benzimidazole moiety were synthesized and tested for their antimicrobial activity. their antimicrobial activities against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, candida krusei and candida albicans were evaluated. while some of the compounds exhibited moderate activity against mrsa, s. aureus, e. faecalis, c. krusei and c. albicans, none of the compounds showed activity against e. coli and p. aeruginosa.
in vitro growth control of selected pathogens by lactobacillus acidophilus- and lactobacillus casei-fermented milk.
aims: food-borne pathogen inhibition was tested in the presence of a mixture of lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus casei during fermentation under controlled ph conditions. methods and results: the growth of escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella serotype typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, listeria innocua, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis was evaluated for 48 h at 37 degrees c. in the presence of the lactic acid bacteria (lab), an increase of the generation time was observed for all the gram-positive bacteria evaluated. staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive strain showing an increase of the generation time by 210%. however, for all the gram-negative bacteria evaluated, no inhibition occurred after 8 h of fermentation. the soluble portion of lact. acidophilus- and lact. casei-fermented milk was recuperated and tested for its antimicrobial activity. listeria innocua and staph. aureus were the most sensitive to the presence of fermented milk supernatant showing an inhibition of 85.9% and 84.7%, respectively. this soluble fraction was neutralized to eliminate the antimicrobial effect of the organic acids produced; the most sensitive strains were l. innocua and e. coli o157:h7 showing an inhibition of 65.9% and 61.9%, respectively. finally, the soluble fraction was neutralized and irradiated at 45 kgy using a (60)co source to eliminate the possible antimicrobial effect of both organic acids and bacteriocin-like substances. enterococcus faecalis, e. coli o157:h7 and staph. aureus were the most affected bacteria by this fraction, showing 39.1, 32 and 31.2% inhibition, respectively. conclusions: the results obtained in this study suggest the implication of both organic acids and bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances in the antimicrobial activity observed in the soluble fraction of the probiotic preparation. significance and impact of the study: this study revealed the antimicrobial mechanisms of action of lact. acidophilus- and lact. casei-fermented milk used to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.
in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of endodontic sealers.
the purpose of this study is to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the endodontic sealers: n-rickert, sealapex, ah plus, mineral trioxide aggregate (mta) and portland cement. the agar diffusion method was used in plates previously inoculated with the following microorganisms: c. albicans, s. aureus, e. faecalis, e. coli. the diameters of microbial inhibition zones were measured after 24 hours of incubation in kiln at 37 degrees c. according to the methodology used, it was possible to conclude that only the sealers ah plus and n-rickert presented antimicrobial activity against c. albicans, s. aureus, and e. coli; no antimicrobial activity in mta, sealapex and portland cement was observed. n-rickert presented the largest inhibition zones varying from 8 to 18 mm, and the microorganism e. faecalis was resistant against all sealers tested.
in vitro antimicrobial activity of crude extracts from plants bryophyllum pinnatum and kalanchoe crenata.
extracts from the leaves of bryophyllum pinnatum and kalanchoe crenata were screened for their antimicrobial activities. solvents used included water, methanol, and local solvents such as palmwine, local gin (seaman's schnapps 40% alcoholic drink,) and "omi ekan-ogi" (sour water from 3 days fermented milled maize). leaves were dried and powdered before being soaked in solvents for 3 days. another traditional method of extraction by squeezing raw juice from the leaves was also employed. all extracts were lyophilized. these extracts were tested against some gram-negative organisms (escherichia coli atcc 25922, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella flexneri, salmonella paratyphi, citrobacter spp); gram-positive organisms staphylococcus aureus atcc 25213, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis) and a fungus (candida albicans). agar well diffusion and broth dilution methods were used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) at concentrations of 512 mg/ml to 4 mg/ml. all the organisms except candida albicans were susceptible to the extracts obtained from the traditional method. the squeezed-leaf juice of kalanchoe crenata was the most active one with mic of 8 mg/ml against pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and bacillus subtilis, 32 mg/ml against shigella flexneri, 64 mg/ml against escherichia coli and 128 mg/ml against the control strain staphylococcus aureus while its mbc is 256 mg/ml against these organisms except bacillus subtilis and klebsiella pneumoniae. the gram-positive organisms were more sensitive to the methanol and local gin-extract of bryophyllum pinnatum. extracts from other solvents showed moderate to weak activity.
antimicrobial activity of diterpenoids from hairy roots of salvia sclarea l.: salvipisone as a potential anti-biofilm agent active against antibiotic resistant staphylococci.
the antimicrobial activities of crude dichloromethane fractions from acetone extracts of agrobacterium rhizogenes transformed roots and roots of field-grown plants of salvia sclarea as well as four pure abietane diterpenoids isolated from the hairy root cultures were determined. the growth of gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis) but not gram-negative ones (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa) or pathogenic fungi (candida albicans) was inhibited by fractions tested at concentrations of 37.5-75.0 microgml(-1). abietane diterpenoids: salvipisone, aethiopinone, 1-oxoaethiopinone and ferruginol were shown to be bacteriostatic as well as bacteriocidal for the cultures of s. aureus and s. epidermidis strains, regardless of their antibiotic susceptibility profile. this was demonstrated by using simultaneously the optical density measuring method and 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide-reduction assay. the highest activity was shown by salvipisone which demonstrated also a very interesting activity when its effect on 24-h-old staphylococcal biofilm cells viability was examined. it limited the survival of biofilms formed by s. aureus as well as by s. epidermidis, putting this compound to the list of potential anti-biofilm agents, better than most of known antibiotics.
prevalence of bacterial species in cats with clinical signs of lower urinary tract disease: recognition of staphylococcus felis as a possible feline urinary tract pathogen.
this study investigated the prevalence of bacterial pathogens of the urinary tract in australian cats. urine was collected by cystocentesis and subjected to urinalysis, bacterial culture and susceptibility testing. a total of 126 isolates were obtained from 107 culture-positive cats. escherichia coli was most commonly isolated (37.3% of isolates) with the majority of isolates showing susceptibility to the 14 antimicrobials tested. just over a quarter of isolates (27.0%) were enterococcus faecalis, which showed resistance to cephalosporins and clindamycin. staphylococcus felis, a previously unreported feline urinary tract pathogen which was susceptible to all antimicrobial agents tested, comprised 19.8% of the isolates. s. felis was significantly associated with urine that had a higher specific gravity (p=0.011) and ph (p=0.006) and was more likely to contain crystals (p=0.002) than urine from which other bacterial species were isolated. this is the first published study that associates the isolation of s. felis with clinical signs of lower urinary tract disease in cats.
antiviral and antimicrobial assessment of some selected flavonoids.
in the current study, the results of antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activity tests of four flavonoid derivatives, scandenone (1), tiliroside (2), quercetin-3,7-o-alpha-l-dirhamnoside (3), and kaempferol-3,7-o-alpha-l-dirhamnoside (4), are presented. antibacterial and antifungal activities of these compounds were tested against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, and enterococcus faecalis, as well as the fungus candida albicans by a micro-dilution method. on the other hand, both dna virus herpes simplex (hsv) and rna virus parainfluenza-3 (pi-3) were employed for antiviral assessment of the compounds using madin-darby bovine kidney and vero cell lines. according to our data, all of the compounds tested were found to be quite active against s. aureus and e. faecalis with mic values of 0.5 microg/ml, followed by e. coli (2 microg/ml), k. pneumoniae (4 microg/ml), a. baumannii (8 micro/g/ml), and b. subtilis (8 microg/ml), while they inhibited c. albicans at 1 microg/ml as potent as ketoconazole. however, only compound 3 displayed an antiviral effect towards pi-3 in the range of 8-32 microg/ml of inhibitory concentration for cytopathogenic effect (cpe).
[comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2004). iii. secular changes in susceptibility].
the bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa) isolated from patients diagnosed as urinary tract infections (utis) in 14 institutions in japan were collected between august 2004 and july 2005. the susceptibilities of these bacteria to various antimicrobial agents were measured. the bacteria were divided into 2 groups consisting of uncomplicated utis and complicated utis (with and without indwelling catheter) based on their isolation origins. the results were compared with those obtained between 1995 and 2003. the drug sensitivity of s. aureus in this year was similar to those in up to the previous year and s. aureus showed the best susceptibility to vancomycin (vcm) and arbekacin (abk). the drug sensitivity of e. faecalis in this year also was similar to those in up to the previous year. the susceptibility of e. coli to cephems in this year was generally good and was similar to those in up to the previous year. mic90 of cefozopran (czop) was the most stable and 0.125 microg/ml or less since 1995. the susceptibility of e. coli to cefpirome (cpr) and cefotiam (ctm) also was good but to cefaclor (ccl), cefixime (cfix), and cefpodoxime (cpdx) was largely decreased in complicated uti groups. the sensitivity of e. coli to carbapenems also was good but to carumonam (crmn) tended to decrease. the susceptibility of e. coli to quinolones, however, has largely changed and has decreased since 2003 in uncomplicated utis and 2000 in complicated utis. that was suggested the development of the resistance to the drug. the susceptibility of klebsiella spp. to cefazolin (cez), ctm, ccl, cpdx, and cefditoren (cdtr) decreased in the previous year and recovered to the year before the previous year in this year. the susceptibility of klebsiella spp. to other cephems was stable since 1995, especially against czop, the highest sensitivity (mic90: < or = 0.125 microg/ml) was maintained. the susceptibility of klebsiella spp. to carbapenems and crmn also was good. the susceptibility of klebsiella spp. to aminoglycosides was lower than to czop but was stable since 1995. the susceptibility of p. aeruginosa was generally low and has largely changed against the majority of the agents since 1995. the susceptibility of p. aeruginosa isolated from uncomplicated utis has largely changed against ceftazidime (caz), cefsulodin (cfs), czop, imipenem (ipm), meropenem (mepm), aztreonam (azt), crmn, gentamicin (gm), and tobramycin (tob). the susceptibility of p. aeruginosa isolated from complicated utis has largely changed against csf, czop, mepm, gm, and ciprofloxacin (cpfx). the susceptibility of p. aeruginosa isolated from complicated utis has been stable against amikacin (amk). for annual changes in mic50, tob and ipm had a relatively stable and high activity (mic50: 0.5-2 microg/ml).
evaluation of the hygienic quality and associated public health hazards of raw milk marketed by smallholder dairy producers in the dar es salaam region, tanzania.
a cross-sectional study was conducted to determine three parameters of the quality of the raw milk marketed by milk selling points (msps) in dar es salaam region. total bacterial count (tbc) was used as an indicator of the microbial quality of the milk; antimicrobial residues were determined; and the california mastitis test (cmt) was used to screen for milk somatic cells as an indication of the mastitis level in the cows that provided the milk. moreover, a water sample at each msp was taken for bacteriological culturing. finally, a questionnaire survey was conducted with the milk sellers at the msps to identify risk factors for poor milk hygiene. a total of 128 milk samples and corresponding water samples were collected from randomly selected milk selling points in dar es salaam region. the mean tbc was (8.2 +/- 1.9) x 10(6) cfu/ml, and major bacterial isolates from the milk samples were escherichia coli (6.3%), bacillus cereus (6.3%), staphylococcus aureus (6.3%) and streptococcus agalactiae (6.3%), enterobacter aerogenes (5.6%) and enterococcus faecalis (4.7%). in most cases, the organisms identified in milk corresponded to those isolated from the corresponding water samples. of milk samples, 79.0% were positive to the cmt and 7.0% were positive for antimicrobial residues. tbc was normalized by log-transformation, and the possible predictors of tbc were identified by fitting two linear regression models. in a random effect model, water microbial quality, frequency of cleaning the milk containers, frequency of milk supply, milk storage time and the type of containers, and mixing of fresh and previous milk were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with the mean log tbc. in a fixed effect model, in addition to these indicators, water shortage, water source and the refrigerator condition were significantly (p < or = 0.01) associated with log tbc. it was concluded that the milk sold in dar es salaam region is of poor quality and is of public health significance.
gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase-glutathione synthetase: domain structure and identification of residues important in substrate and glutathione binding.
in most organisms, glutathione (gsh) is synthesized by the sequential action of distinct enzymes, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-gcs) and gsh synthetase (gs). in streptococcus agalactiae, gsh synthesis is catalyzed by a single enzyme, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase-glutathione synthetase (gamma-gcs-gs). the n-terminal sequence of gamma-gcs-gs is similar to escherichia coli gamma-gcs, but the c-terminal sequence is an atp-grasp domain more similar to d-ala, d-ala ligase than to any known gs. in the present studies, c-terminally and n-terminally truncated constructs were characterized in order to define the limits of the gamma-gcs and gs domains, respectively. although wt gamma-gcs-gs is nearly uninhibited by gsh (k(i) approximately 140 mm), shorter gamma-gcs domain constructs were unexpectedly found to be strongly inhibited (k(i) approximately 15 mm), reproducing a physiologically important regulation seen in monofunctional gamma-gcs enzymes. because studies with e. coli gamma-gcs implicate a flexible loop region in gsh binding, chimeras of s. agalactiae gamma-gcs-gs were made containing gamma-gcs domain flexible loop sequences from enterococcus faecalis and pasteurella multocida gamma-gcs-gs, isoforms that are inhibited by gsh. inhibition remained s. agalactiae-like (i.e., very weak). c-terminal constructs of gamma-gcs-gs have gs activity (0.01-0.04% of wt), but proper folding and significant gs activity required a covalently linked gamma-gcs domain. in addition, site-directed mutants in the middle region of the gamma-gcs-gs sequence established that gs activity depends on residues in a region that is also part of the gamma-gcs domain. our results provide new insights into the structure of gamma-gcs-gs and suggest gamma-gcs-gs evolved from a monomeric gamma-gcs that became c-terminally fused to a multimeric atp-grasp protein.
antibacterial analysis in vitro of ethyl-cyanoacrylate against ocular pathogens.
purpose: to analyze the antimicrobial properties of ethyl-cyanoacrylate (superbonder, loctite, brazil) in vitro in different microorganisms related to corneal infections. methods: we analyzed the following microorganisms: (1) staphylococcus aureus (multiresistant); (2) s. aureus (atcc 25923); (3) coagulase-negative staphylococcus; (4) streptococcus pyogenes; (5) streptococcus pneumoniae; (6) pseudomonas aeruginosa (multiresistant); (7) p. aeruginosa (atcc 27853); (8) escherichia coli (atcc25922); and (9) enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212). one drop of the glue was dropped directly into the nutrient broth. the plates were incubated at 35 +/- 2 degrees c and its growth examined after 24 hours. bactericidal activity of the glue was verified by sampling inhibition zones when present. the samples were plated in blood agar an analyzed after 24 and 48 hours. results: the ethyl-cyanoacrylate inhibited the growth of every gram-positive microorganism tested and showed bactericidal effect over 70% for all of them. among the gram-negative microorganisms, only the e. coli and the e. faecalis had its growth inhibited, and the bactericidal effect was 60% and 40%, respectively. conclusion: the ethyl-cyanoacrylate has bacteriostatic and bactericidal action in vitro, mainly against gram-positive microorganisms.
genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity in enterococcus isolates from batzos, a raw goat milk cheese.
this study investigated the genotypic and phenotypic diversity in 34 isolates of  enterococci obtained during ripening of batzos cheese from raw goat milk and characterized phenotypically as enterococcus durans. rapd-pcr, plasmid profiling and pfge were used to study the genetic variability and distinguish closely related isolates. species recognition by means of rapd-pcr was in agreement with the phenotypic identification for 29 strains. one strain was characterized as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis by rapd-pcr and four strains were grouped with the enterococcus faecium reference strain. all strains were vancomycin sensitive, while 10 strains showed beta-haemolytic reaction on human blood and the majority of them (88.9%) showed decarboxylase activity on tyramine. all strains exhibited antagonistic activity against bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and listeria monocytogenes and the majority inhibited enterococcus faecalis. isolates displayed weak acidifying ability and low proteolytic activities when grown in milk for 24h. however, their caseinolytic activity after growth in milk for seven days was significant with preference for alphas-casein degradation.
[comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2003). ii. background of patients].
seven hundred and nineteen bacterial strains isolated from 565 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (utis) in 14 institutions in japan were collected between august 2002 and july 2003. the frequency of bacteria isolation divided with patient clinical background was compared. the clinical background investigated included sex, age, type of infections, timing of antibiotics administration, and presence or absence of surgery affecting a decrease in defense against infection. the bacterial strains were divided with the age and sex of the patients and the types of infections. in males, the number of patients aged less than 50 years was few and the complicated utis without indwelling catheter was observed most frequently. number of patients aged 20-39 years was greater in female than male. in all of ages except 0-9 and 70-79 years, the ratio of the uncomplicated utis was high, accounting for 44.4-91.7% of all types of infections. in the present time, the bacteria most frequently isolated were escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis also were relatively frequently isolated. e. coli was most frequently isolated from the uncomplicated utis, and p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis were frequently isolated from the complicated utis with indwelling catheter. with respect to the relation of these results to the age of the patients, in the uncomplicated utis, the isolation frequency of e. coli was the highest in all age groups, accounting for 40% or higher. in the complicated utis without indwelling catheter, the isolation frequency of e. coli decreased with aging of the patients but still was the highest in all age groups. in the complicated utis with indwelling catheter, the isolation frequency of e. coli was lower than in the uncomplicated utis in all age groups and p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis were more frequently isolated. in comparison of causative bacteria in utis between before and after the administration of antibiotics, p. aeruginosa increased after the administration in any types of utis. in comparison of causative bacteria in utis with or without surgery, e. coli was more frequently isolated in the patients without surgery, while p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis were more frequently isolated in the patients with surgery in any utis.
acquired antimicrobial resistance in the intestinal microbiota of diverse cat populations.
the aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of acquired antimicrobial resistance in the resident intestinal microbiota of cats and to identify significant differences between various cat populations. escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium and streptococcus canis were isolated as faecal indicator bacteria from rectal swabs of 47 individually owned cats, 47 cattery cats and 18 hospitalised cats, and submitted through antimicrobial sensitivity tests. the results revealed that bacteria isolated from hospitalised and/or cattery cats were more frequently resistant than those from individually owned cats. e. coli isolates from hospitalised cats were particularly resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline and sulfonamide. both enterococci and streptococci showed high resistance to tetracycline and in somewhat lesser extent to erythromycin and tylosin. most e. faecium isolates were resistant to lincomycin and penicillin. one e. faecalis as well as one e. faecium isolate from hospitalised cats showed 'high-level resistance' (mic > 500 microg/ml) against gentamicin, a commonly used antimicrobial agent in case of human enterococcal infections. the results of this research demonstrate that the extent of acquired antimicrobial resistance in the intestinal microbiota of cats depends on the social environment of the investigated population. it is obvious that the flora of healthy cats may act as a reservoir of resistance genes.
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sm-216601, a new broad-spectrum  parenteral carbapenem.
sm-216601 is a novel parenteral 1beta-methylcarbapenem. in agar dilution susceptibility testing, the mic of sm-216601 for 90% of the methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) strains tested (mic(90)) was 2 microg/ml, which was comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid. sm-216601 was also very potent against enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-resistant strains (mic(90) = 8 microg/ml). sm-216601 exhibited potent activity against penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis, with mic(90)s of less than 0.5 microg/ml, and intermediate activity against citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the therapeutic efficacy of sm-216601 against experimentally induced infections in mice caused by s. aureus, e. faecium, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa reflected its in vitro activity and plasma level. thus, sm-216601 is a promising candidate for nosocomial bacterial infections caused by a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including multiresistant pathogens.
bacterial flora of leg ulcers in patients admitted to department of dermatology,  poznan university of medical sciences, during the 1998-2002 period.
venous leg ulcers are an important cause of morbidity in a significant percentage of the world population. the percentage of leg ulceration, either active or healed, in the european population is about 1%-2%. the aim of this study was to analyze the rate of colonization and qualitative composition of the bacterial flora isolated from leg ulcers in patients admitted to dermatology department, poznan university of medical sciences, during the 1998-2002 period, with special reference to the infection risk factors. bacteriological diagnosis of 175 wound swabs was performed in compliance with compulsory laboratory methods. in 173 positive results, the predominant culture composition included staphylococcus aureus (56.57%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (37.14%), enterococcus faecalis (22.29%), proteus mirabilis (13.71%) and escherichia coli (12.57%). there was a significant increase in the incidence of pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and escherichia coli, along with a decrease in the incidence of staphylococcus aureus isolation during the study period. the rate of yeast-like fungi strains, mainly candida albicans, recorded in culture composition showed a systematic increase. changes in the qualitative and quantitative composition of bacterial flora, presence of multiple isolates, and concomitant diseases that may influence the characteristics of leg ulcer disease were closely monitored.
a study on inhibitory effects of sigla tree (liquidambar orientalis mill. var. orientalis) storax against several bacteria.
in this study, sigla (liquidambar orientalis mill.) storax (styrax) was investigated for antibacterial activity against aeromonas hydrophila, bacillus amyloliquefaciens, b. brevis, b. cereus, b. megaterium, b. subtilis, corynebacterium xerosis, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, e. coli o157:h7, klebsiella pneumoniae, listeria monocytogenes, micrococcus luteus, mycobacterium smegmatis, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, p. fluorescens, staphylococcus aureus and yersinia enterocolitica. the storax was dissolved in absolute ethanol and was tested at concentrations of 10.0%, 1.0%, 0.4%, 0.2% and 0.1%. pure ethanol was used for the control. the antibacterial activity of the sigla storax was determined by using the agar diffusion method. the growths of a. hydrophila, b. amyloliquefaciens, b. megaterium, e. coli, e. coli o157:h7, l. monocytogenes and y. enterocolitica were not inhibited by any of the concentrations of sigla storax. the results showed that sigla storax has antibacterial activity against many bacteria at concentrations of 10.0% and against some bacteria at concentrations of 1.0%, 0.4% and 0.2%.
cloning, production and functional expression of enterocin p, a sec-dependent bacteriocin produced by enterococcus faecium p13, in escherichia coli.
the cloning and expression of enterocin p (entp), a sec-dependent bacteriocin produced by enterococcus faecium p13, was studied in escherichia coli. pcr-amplified products of the preenterocin p gene (entp) or entp plus the putative entp immunity gene (entip), were cloned in plasmid petblue-1 under the control of the inducible t7lac promoter. although target genes in derivative plasmids pjg01 (entp) and pjg02 (entp plus entip) did not generate products with antimicrobial activity after an in vitro combined transcription/translation reaction, they were expressed as biologically active products following transformation and induction in the e. coli tuner(de3)placi host. the use of specific antibodies and an elisa permitted the detection and quantification of entp in the supernatant (sn), cellular soluble protein fraction (csf), and inclusion bodies (ib) of e. coli tuner(de3)placi cells transformed with either pjg01 or pjg02. functional entp from the supernatants of e. coli tuner(de3)placi (pjg01) cultures grown in a complex medium was recovered, at a high efficiency, by immunoaffinity chromatography in a single step. a purification method based on hydrophobic adsorption and reverse-phase chromatographies also permitted the recovery of active entp from the supernatants of the same cultures grown in a minimally defined medium. the e. coli tuner(de3)placi (pjg01) cells would merit consideration as an alternative experimental model for the heterologous production and functional expression of entp, as well as for the fast and efficient recovery of this bacteriocin from the supernatant of this recombinant producer.
antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of contemporary pathogens from uncomplicated urinary tract infections isolated in a multicenter italian survey: possible impact on guidelines.
during 2004 four italian laboratories assessed the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens causing acute uncomplicated cystitis in female out-patients. a total of 600 urine samples from individuals aged 18-65 were studied. the overall prevalence of escherichia coli was 85.3%. klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus saprophyticus, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis and other rarer species were far less represented. determination of the antibiotic susceptibility pattern of the entire collection of e. coli (512 organisms) revealed that among the drugs analyzed ampicillin was the least active molecule with only 62.5% of the strains being inhibited. amoxicillin-clavulanate and cefuroxime displayed a higher potency (87.7% and 89.2% respectively). cotrimoxazole inhibited only 70.1% of the uropathogens. the three fluoquinolones tested had comparable activity ranging from 83.0% for ciprofloxacin, to 83.6% for levofloxacin and 84.9% for prulifloxacin, indicating an identical spectrum of cross resistance. nitrofurantoin (96.7%) and fosfomycin (98.6%) were the most potent drugs. against the whole collection of uropathogens, only cefuroxime, nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin overcame the threshold of 90% activity, with the fluoroquinolones and amoxicillin-clavulanate suffering from about 15% resistance. the results of this survey strongly support the conclusions of recent italian guidelines concerning the best empiric treatment of uti in this country today.
characterization of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria isolated from spoiled black olives.
bacteriocin-producing strains of lactobacillus plantarum st23ld and st341ld, enterococcus faecium st311ld and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides st33ld were isolated from the brine of spoiled black olives. the bacteriocins produced by all four strains inhibited the growth of gram-positive bacteria (e. faecalis, l. casei and streptococcus pneumoniae), but also escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. strain st23ld produced two bacteriocins (st23lda and st23ldb of approximately 3.0 and 14.0 kda, respectively), with a combined maximum level of activity of 25,600 au/ml after 18 h of growth. the same level of activity was recorded for bacteriocin st341ld (approximately 3.0 kda), but after 16 h. bacteriocins st311ld (ca. 2.3 kda) and st33ld (ca. 2.7 kda) were produced at much lower levels (6400 au/ml), and only after 20 h of growth. bacteriocin activity was destroyed after treatment with proteolytic enzymes and triton x, but not when treated with alpha-amylase, sds, tween 20, tween 80, urea and edta, or when heated for 20 min at 121 degrees c. addition of bacteriocins st23ld, st341ld and st311ld to cells of lactobacillus casei lhs in logarithmic phase resulted in growth inhibition for one hour, followed by a slight increase in optical density over the next seven hours. bacteriocin st33ld also inhibited the growth of strain lhs, but to a lesser extent. bacteriocins st23ld, st341ld and st33ld remained at the same level of activity for 6 h at ph<4.0. however, the activity of bacteriocin st311ld decreased by 50% within 2 h at ph 4.4. the possibility of the bacteriocin adsorbing to the producer cell and proteolytic degradation is unlikely.
in vitro antimicrobial activity of fill canal, sealapex, mineral trioxide aggregate, portland cement and endorez.
aim: to determine in vitro the antimicrobial activity of fill canal, sealapex, mineral trioxide aggregate (mta), portland cement and endorez on various species of microorganisms. methodology: the diffusion method on muller-hinton agar (mh) was employed. a base layer was made using mh agar and five wells were made by removing agar at equidistant points. sealers were placed into the wells immediately after manipulation. the microorganisms enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, escherichia coli atcc 25922, micrococcus luteus atcc 9341, staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853 and candida albicans atcc 10231 were seeded by pour plate. the plates were kept at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion and then incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h. aliquots of 10 ml of 0.05% triphenyltetrazolium chloride gel were added for optimization and the zones of inhibition were measured. results: sealapex and fill canal demonstrated antimicrobial activity for all strains. for mta and portland cement, only e. coli was not inhibited. no antimicrobial activity was detected for endorez. conclusions: in this laboratory study, fill canal, sealapex, mta and portland cement presented antimicrobial activity whilst endorez did not.
combined effect of high-pressure treatments and bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria on inactivation of escherichia coli o157:h7 in raw-milk cheese.
the effect of high-pressure (hp) treatments combined with bacteriocins of lactic  acid bacteria (lab) produced in situ on the survival of escherichia coli o157:h7 in cheese was investigated. cheeses were manufactured from raw milk inoculated with e. coli o157:h7 at approximately 10(5) cfu/ml. seven different bacteriocin-producing lab were added at approximately 10(6) cfu/ml as adjuncts to the starter. cheeses were pressurized on day 2 or 50 at 300 mpa for 10 min or 500 mpa for 5 min, at 10 degrees c in both cases. after 60 days, e. coli o157:h7 counts in cheeses manufactured without bacteriocin-producing lab and not pressurized were 5.1 log cfu/g. a higher inactivation of e. coli o157:h7 was achieved in cheeses without bacteriocin-producing lab when 300 mpa was applied on day 50 (3.8-log-unit reduction) than if applied on day 2 (1.3-log-unit reduction). application of 500 mpa eliminated e. coli o157:h7 in 60-day-old cheeses. cheeses made with bacteriocin-producing lab and not pressurized showed a slight reduction of the pathogen. pressurization at 300 mpa on day 2 and addition of lacticin 481-, nisin a-, bacteriocin tab 57-, or enterocin as-48-producing lab were synergistic and reduced e. coli o157:h7 counts to levels below 2 log units in 60-day-old cheeses. pressurization at 300 mpa on day 50 and addition of nisin a-, bacteriocin tab 57-, enterocin i-, or enterocin as-48-producing lab completely inactivated e. coli o157:h7 in 60-day-old cheeses. the application of reduced pressures combined with bacteriocin-producing lab is a feasible procedure to improve cheese safety.
the expression of alpha4 integrins by human polymorphonuclear neutrophils in response to sonicated extracts of enterococcus faecalis.
this study was undertaken to investigate immunopathologic mechanism of enterococcus faecalis in relation to persistent apical periodontitis. we monitored the expression levels of alpha4 integrin in human polymorphonuclear neutophils (pmns) after stimulated with sonicated extracts of e. faecalis (sef) and compared with lipopolycaccarides (lps) of escherichia coli for various incubation time. venous blood was collected from healthy volunteers and then pmns were isolated and cultured with various concentrations of sef for different periods of time. the levels of alpha4 integrin were measured by flow cytometry analysis. e. coli lps group was used as a positive control and untreated pmns as a negative control. results showed that the expressions levels of alpha4 integrin were increased in human pmns stimulated with e. coli lps in comparison with unstimulated control cells (p < 0.05). in case of sef stimulated group, the expression levels were decreased in time-dependent manner in comparison to e. coli lps group (p < 0.05). notably, after 12 h for incubation with sef, the expression of alpha4 integrin was decreased in dose-dependent manner (p < 0.05). these findings suggest that e. faecalis seem to suppress pmns recruiting activity by down-regulating alpha4 integrin expression, providing the possible mechanism that e. faecalis may play a crucial role in persistent apical periodontitis.
optimization of bacteriocin production by lactobacillus plantarum st13br, a strain isolated from barley beer.
the cell-free supernatant containing bacteriocin st13br, produced by lactobacillus plantarum st13br, inhibits the growth of l. casei, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli. based on tricine-sds-page, bacteriocin st13br is 10 kda in size. complete inactivation or significant reduction in bacteriocin activity was observed after treatment with proteinase k, trypsin and pronase, but not with catalase or alpha-amylase. low bacteriocin activity (200 au/ml) was recorded in bhi medium, m17 broth, 10% (w/v) soy milk, and 2% and 10% (w/v) molasses, despite good growth. maximal bacteriocin activity (6,400 au/ml) was recorded after 23 h in mrs broth, but only at 30 degrees c. tween 80 in mrs broth increased bacteriocin production by more than 50%. meat extract or yeast extract as sole nitrogen source, or a combination of the two (1 : 1) in mrs broth, stimulated bacteriocin production (6,400 au/ml). only 50% activity (3,200 au/ml) was recorded with tryptone as sole nitrogen source, whereas a combination of tryptone, meat extract and yeast extract yielded 6,400 au/ml. bacteriocin production was not stimulated by the addition of glucose at 2.0% w/v (3,200 au/ml), nor 2% (w/v) fructose, sucrose, lactose or mannose, respectively (800 au/ml). activity levels less than 200 au/ml were recorded in the presence of 0.05% to 0.5% (w/v) maltose. maximal bacteriocin production (6,400 au/ml) was recorded in the presence of 2% (w/v) maltose. maltose at 4.0% (w/v) led to a 50% reduction of bacteriocin activity. the presence of 1.0% (w/v) and higher kh(2)po(4), or glycerol at 0.2% (w/v) suppressed bacteriocin production.
[comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2002). ii. background of patients].
a total of 615 bacterial strains isolated from 491 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (utis) in 13 institutions in japan were supplied between august 2002 and july 2003. then, the clinical background of patients were investigated such as sex, age, and type of infections and kind of bacteria, frequency of bacteria isolation by age and infections, bacteria and infections by timing of antibiotics administration, and bacteria and infections by surgical procedures. the bacterial strains were divided by the age and sex of the patients and the types of infections. in males, the number of patients aged less than 50 years was few and the complicated utis without indwelling catheter was observed most frequently. in the present time, the bacteria most frequently isolated were escherichia coli. pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis were also relatively frequently isolated. e. coli decreased and p. aeruginosa increased with the complication of the infections. e. faecalis tended to be isolated more frequently in the complicated utis than in the uncomplicated utis. with respect to the relation of these results to the age of the patients, in the uncomplicated utis, the isolation frequency of e. coli was the highest in all age groups, accounting for 70.8% in 20-49 years old. in the complicated utis without indwelling catheter, the isolation frequency of e. coli decreased with aging of the patients and was lower than that of e. faecalis in the patients aged 70 or more (18.3 vs 20.6%). in the complicated utis with indwelling catheter, the isolation frequency of e. coli was lower than in the uncomplicated utis in all age groups and p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis were more frequently isolated. in comparison of causative bacteria in utis between before and after the administration of antibiotics, e. coli decreased and p. aeruginosa increased after the administration in any utis. in comparison of causative bacteria in utis with or without surgery, e. coli was more frequently isolated in the patients without surgery, while p. aeruginosa was more in the patients with surgery in any utis. e. faecalis was more frequently isolated in the patients with surgery in uncomplicated and complicated utis without indwelling catheter and in the patients without surgery in complicated utis with indwelling catheter.
antimicrobial potential of immobilized lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis atcc 11454 against selected bacteria.
immobilization of living cells of lactic acid bacteria could be an alternative or complementary method of immobilizing organic acids and bacteriocins and inhibit undesirable bacteria in foods. this study evaluated the inhibition potential of immobilized lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis atcc 11454 on selected bacteria by a modified method of the agar spot test. l. lactis was immobilized in calcium alginate (1 to 2%)-whey protein concentrate (0 and 1%) beads. the antimicrobial potential of immobilized l. lactis was evaluated in microbiological media against pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli, salmonella, and staphylococcus aureus) or pseudomonas putida, a natural meat contaminant, and against seven gram-positive bacteria used as indicator strains. results obtained in this study indicated that immobilized l. lactis inhibited the growth of s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus curvatus, lactobacillus sakei, kocuria varians, and pediococcus acidilactici. only 4 h of incubation at 35 degrees c resulted in a clear inhibition zone around the beads that increased with time. with the addition of 10 mm of a chelating agent (edta) to the media, results showed growth inhibition of e. coli; however, p. putida and salmonella typhi were unaffected by this treatment. these results indicate that immobilized lactic acid bacteria strains can be successfully used to produce nisin and inhibit bacterial growth in semisolid synthetic media.
[search of promising strains of bifidobacteria and lactobacillus for the development of new biopreparations].
for the first time the species composition of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in  clinically healthy young children has been studied. as revealed in this study, the dominating species of bifidobacteria are b. longum, b. adolescentis and b. infantis, while the dominating species of lactobacilli are lactobacillus acidophilus and l. rhamnosus. in 83 isolated cultures of bifidobacteria and 34 isolated species of lactobacilli the activity of acid formation and the antagonistic activity with respect to escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, clostridium perfringens have been tested. b. longum strain 58b, b. infantis strain 37b, l. rhamnosus strain 12l and l. acidophilus strain 27l, typical for children of this age group, having good antagonistic activity and pronounced acid-forming properties, have been selected. these strains hold good promise to be used as the basis for the development of a complex probiotic preparation for correcting intestinal microflora in young children.
sensitization of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria to jenseniin g by sublethal injury.
jenseniin g, a bacteriocin produced by propionibacterium thoenii p126, is active  against related propionibacteria and some lactic acid bacteria and is sporostatic to botulinal spores. the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of sublethal stress on jenseniin g activity. bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, staphylococcus aureus, and yersinia enterocolitica were subjected to temperature, acid, and osmotic stresses in the presence of jenseniin g. the bacteriocin reduced the viability of sublethally injured cultures, although the extent of reduction varied with strain and treatment. e. faecalis was the most sensitive to temperature stress; no reduction of viable counts occurred in the absence of jenseniin g, and a 1.5-log reduction occurred in the presence of jenseniin g. b. cereus, l. monocytogenes, and s. aureus were more sensitive to jenseniin g when exposed to heat stress than when exposed to cold stress, whereas e. coli, salmonella typhimurium, and s. flexneri were more sensitive to jenseniin g when exposed to cold stress than when exposed to heat stress. when comparing an acid stress test alone to a combination of acid stress and jenseniin g, e. faecalis and l. monocytogenes showed the greatest sensitivities with 4.87- and 2.82-log reductions, respectively, after 7 days. all cultures except for s. aureus were adversely affected by the combination of salt stress and jenseniin g. salmonella typhimurium showed the greatest sensitivity to salt stress with jenseniin g (a 1.54-log reduction at day 7) when compared to salt stress alone (a 0.55-log reduction at day 7). jenseniin g, like bacteriocins produced by other gram-positive species, has broader activity against stressed organisms.
antibiotic resistance among fecal indicator bacteria from healthy individually owned and kennel dogs.
escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis strains isolated from anal swabs of clinically healthy dogs were examined for the presence of acquired antimicrobial resistance. the strains originated from dogs of 92 different owners and from eight breeding kennels. the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the resistance situation in the intestinal flora of the dog to assess the possible role of the dog flora as a reservoir of antimicrobial resistance. multiple resistance was rarely found in e. coli strains collected from individually owned dogs, in contrast with strains from kennel dogs. resistance to ampicillin, trimethoprim, and sulfamethoxazole was significantly less prevalent in e. coli from privately owned dogs than in strains from kennel dogs. resistance rates against tetracycline and macrolides were unexpectedly high in e. faecalis strains. two and three e. faecalis strains from individually owned dogs and kennel dogs, respectively, were resistant to gentamicin, an antibiotic often used for treating enterococcal infections in humans. this study demonstrates that resistance percentages may fluctuate with the choice of dog population. the observed antimicrobial resistance percentages indicate that the flora of healthy dogs may act as a reservoir of resistance genes.
translocation of enterococcus faecalis strains across a monolayer of polarized human enterocyte-like t84 cells.
we used a two-chamber system to study transcytosis of enterococcus faecalis across monolayers of human colon carcinoma-derived t84 cells, which show structural resemblance to the native intestine. among 16 e. faecalis isolates from different sources, the well-characterized strain og1rf and 8 other isolates (2 endocarditis isolates, 1 urine isolate, and all 5 fecal isolates) showed translocation in this assay, while 6 clinical isolates (3 endocarditis and 3 urine isolates), the recipient strain jh2-2, and the control, escherichia coli dh5alpha, had no detectable translocation. of two og1rf mutants involving the previously studied epa (enterococcal polysaccharide antigen) gene cluster, known to be needed for virulence and resistance to killing by polymorphonuclear leukocytes, one epa mutant (tx5179) was unable to translocate, while tx5180, with an epa disruption farther downstream, showed a moderate decrease in translocation relative to that of the wild-type strain og1rf (p < 0.01), indicating that the epa gene cluster is important for translocation across a t84 monolayer. this observation was confirmed by complementation of the epa mutant (tx5179) with epa genes and restoration of its translocation ability. in conclusion, we have demonstrated translocation of at least some strains of e. faecalis across t84 monolayers, although strains differ considerably in this ability, and we have demonstrated that epa mutations can cause marked changes in successful translocation. these results suggest that this model may be a useful in vitro system for studying the process of translocation from the intestinal tract.
harmonization of antimicrobial susceptibility testing among veterinary diagnostic laboratories in the five nordic countries.
a total of 100 bacterial strains (25 escherichia coli, 25 salmonella enterica, 25 staphylococcus aureus, and 25 enterococcus strains) and four reference strains were tested for susceptibility toward 8-12 antimicrobial agents in 12 veterinary diagnostic laboratories in the five nordic countries using routine methodology. in addition, the 25 enterococcus strains were identified to species level. a total of 22,598 (97.2%) out of 23,259 test results were in accordance when the data were categorized as susceptible or resistant. when the reported results were categorized according to the national committee of clinical laboratory standards breakpoints, the percentage of concordant results increased to 98.4% and the performance between laboratories varied between 94.2 and 99.4% concordant results. for e. coli, s. aureus, and salmonella, all laboratories except one had more than 97% concordant results, whereas for enterococcus spp., two laboratories had less than 90% concordant results. susceptibility testing of salmonella to fluoroquinolones gave rise to almost 0.5% nonconcordant results and susceptibility testing of s. aureus to vancomycin resulted in that 1.8% of the strains were incorrectly reported as vancomycin resistant. ten laboratories identified the enterococcus spp. to species level. all five enterococcus faecium and 10 enterococcus faecalis selected from the strain collection at the danish veterinary institute were correctly identified by all laboratories, whereas some problems were observed identifying other enterococcal species. this study showed a good performance and agreement in antimicrobial susceptibility testing at the 12 participating laboratories and that surveillance data covering susceptibility test results of e. coli, s. aureus, and salmonella from animals in the nordic countries are comparable. but it also showed that some aspects can be improved. in addition, the study showed that the different laboratories are capable of identifying e. faecalis and e. faecium.
[comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2001). ii. background of patients].
five-hundred thirty one bacterial strains isolated from 412 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (utis) in 10 institutions in japan were supplied between september and december 2001. then, the clinical background of patients were investigated such as sex, age, and type of infections, infections and kind of bacteria, frequency of bacteria isolation by age and infections, bacteria and infections by timing of antibiotics administration, and bacteria and infections by surgical procedures. with regard to the relationship between age and sex of patients and type of infections, the number of cases aged lower than 50 years was few and complicated utis without indwelling catheter was the most frequent in male patients. in females, the number of patients aged lower than 20 years was few. most of female patients aged lower than 80 years had uncomplicated utis. as for the relationship between type of infections and kind of bacteria, escherichia coli decreased as the infections were more complicated, and pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis increased as the infections were more complicated. in relation of these results to age of patients, isolation frequency of e. coli gradually decreased with aging in patients aged 20 years and older with uncomplicated utis. the isolation frequencies of e. faecalis decreased with aging in the patients with complicated utis without indwelling catheter while p. aeruginosa decreased with aging in the patients with complicated utis with indwelling catheter. e. coli was isolated a few after administration of antibiotics, and p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis were frequently isolated after administration in the patients with all types of infections. as for type of causative organisms in utis and with or without surgical operation, e. coli was frequently isolated in the patients without surgery in the patients with uncomplicated utis and complicated utis without indwelling catheter, while p. aeruginosa was frequently isolated in the patients who underwent surgery in the patients with uncomplicated utis and complicated utis with indwelling catheter. in uncomplicated utis, isolation frequencies of klebsiella spp., p. aeruginosa, and e. faecalis were significant in the patients with surgery. in complicated utis without indwelling catheter, klebsiella spp. was frequently isolated in the patients with surgery. in complicated utis with indwelling catheter, s. aureus and staphylococcus spp. were frequently isolated in the patients without surgery.
efrab, an abc multidrug efflux pump in enterococcus faecalis.
a dna fragment responsible for resistance to antimicrobial agents was cloned from the chromosomal dna of enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212 by using drug-hypersensitive mutant escherichia coli kam32 as a host cell. cells of e. coli kam32 harboring a recombinant plasmid (paef82) carrying the dna fragment became resistant to many structurally unrelated antimicrobial agents, such as norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, acriflavine, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, tetraphenylphosphonium chloride, daunorubicin, and doxorubicin. since the sequence of the whole genome of e. faecalis is known, we sequenced several portions of the dna insert in plasmid paef82 and identified two open reading frames within the insert. we designated the genes efra and efrb. a search of the deduced amino acid sequences of efra and efrb revealed that they are similar to each other and that they belong to the atp-binding cassette (abc) family of multidrug efflux transporters. transformed e. coli kam32 cells harboring efrab showed energy-dependent efflux of acriflavine. the efflux activity was inhibited by reserpine, verapamil, and sodium-o-vanadate, known inhibitors of abc efflux pumps.
characterization of escherichia coli strains causing urinary tract infections in  patients with transposed intestinal segments.
purpose: transposition of intestinal segments into the urinary tract predisposes  to urinary tract infections. we characterized bacterial infections in these patients and examined the virulence genotype and persistence of escherichia coli isolates. materials and methods: we followed 26 patients who underwent bladder reconstructive surgery using transposed intestinal segments. e. coli strains isolated from the urine of these patients were genotyped for established virulence determinants and the frequency of carriage was compared with e. coli strains isolated from community acquired urinary infections and the fecal flora of anonymous volunteers. a longitudinal study of e. coli strains in 9 patients was also done using pulsed field gel electrophoresis. results: e. coli was the most frequently isolated organism, responsible for 59% (62 of 105) of monobacterial infections. other bacteria isolated included klebsiella species, proteus species and enterococcus faecalis. community acquired e. coli strains were more likely to carry multiple determinants for particular adhesins (p and s fimbriae) and toxins (alpha-hemolysin and cytotoxic necrotizing factor) than fecal strains. carriage frequency for bladder reconstruction strains was intermediary and not significantly different. the key finding was that e. coli strains persisted for prolonged periods, including 2 years in certain patients, often despite various antimicrobial treatments. conclusions: this study highlights that further steps must be taken to prevent and treat urinary tract infections in this susceptible group. particular attention should be given to the treatment of persistent infections.
escherichia coli 83972 inhibits catheter adherence by a broad spectrum of uropathogens.
objectives: the presence of a nonpathogenic organism on the surface of a urinary  catheter might impede catheter colonization by pathogens and thus prevent urinary tract infection. previously, we reported that preinoculating urinary catheters with a nonpathogenic strain of escherichia coli (83972) significantly impeded catheter colonization in vitro by gram-positive bacteria (enterococcus faecalis). to explore this phenomenon further, we investigated in vitro whether e. coli 83972 could likewise inhibit catheter colonization by gram-negative and fungal uropathogens (providencia stuartii, uropathogenic e. coli, and candida albicans). methods: for each of the three uropathogens tested, we examined three different incubation conditions: (a) e. coli plus uropathogen catheters were exposed to e. coli 83972 for 24 hours and then to a uropathogen for 30 minutes; (b) e. coli-alone catheters were incubated with e. coli for 24 hours and then in sterile broth for 30 minutes; and (c) uropathogen-alone catheters were incubated in sterile broth for 24 hours before the 30-minute incubation with the uropathogen. all catheters were subsequently incubated in sterile human urine for 24 hours. catheters were then rinsed and sonicated to determine the numbers of adherent organisms per centimeter. results: pre-exposure of the catheter to e. coli 83972 in all cases significantly reduced the number of uropathogens colonizing the catheter surfaces. conclusions: e. coli 83972 significantly impedes catheter colonization by all tested bacterial and fungal pathogens. the broad applicability of this particular approach to bacterial interference in vitro invites further exploration in vivo.
a uk multicentre study of the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial pathogens causing urinary tract infection.
objectives: to determine the prevalence of resistance amongst urinary tract pathogens against antimicrobials used to treat urinary tract infections (utis) in the uk to provide data to help direct empirical therapy. method: during 1999-2000, a total of 1291 bacterial isolates causing uti were collected from 8 centres in the uk. isolates were cultured from patients with (1). community-acquired uti in those less than 65 years old (397), (2). hospital-acquired uti other than those admitted with pyelonephritis (394), (3). pyelonephritis (108) and (4). community-acquired uti in those greater than 65 years old (392). after re-identification, mics for a range of antimicrobials were determined and interpreted using nccls procedures and interpretive guidelines. results: escherichia coli was the predominant pathogen in all categories but the total percentage for each category varied (56.3-77.3%). the next three pathogens of importance were enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis which varied in prevalence slightly from category to category. the activity of amoxycillin against e. coli (51.3% susceptible) was greatly reduced as a result of beta-lactamase production and only partially restored by the addition of clavulanic acid (78.8% susceptible). cefuroxime was very active against e. coli using parenteral form breakpoints (97.1% susceptible) but less so using oral form breakpoints (68.6% susceptible). cefuroxime was inactive against enterococcus spp. and pseudomonas spp. nitrofurantoin was very active against isolates of e. coli (96.3% susceptible) and e. faecalis but not against k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis or pseudomonas aeruginosa. overall susceptibility to trimethoprim ranged from 58.1% to 84.5% for the most prevalent pathogens. ciprofloxacin was highly active against the uti pathogens examined in this study with susceptibilities of between 88.6% and 97.7% for the most prevalent pathogens (e. coli, n=864, 97.7% susceptible) and was the only oral agent tested with activity against pseudomonas spp. conclusion: these data provide much needed information on the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance amongst pathogens currently causing uti in the uk.
functional cloning and expression of emea, and characterization of emea, a multidrug efflux pump from enterococcus faecalis.
a fragment of chromosomal dna from enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212 was cloned using escherichia coli kam32 host cells lacking major multidrug efflux pumps. e. coli kam32 cells were sensitive to many antimicrobial agents, and the transformed cells harboring a recombinant plasmid became resistant to several structurally unrelated antimicrobial agents such as tetraphenylphosphonium chloride, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (dapi), hoechst 33342, acriflavine, benzalkonium chloride, norfloxacin and ethidium bromide. this suggests that the cloned dna fragment carries a gene(s) encoding a multidrug efflux pump. determination of the nucleotide sequence of the cloned dna revealed a gene designated as emea. the transformed e. coli cells showed efflux activity of several antimicrobial agents such as dapi, hoechst 33342 and acriflavine. efflux of dapi via emea was strongly inhibited by reserpine.
mc21-a, a bactericidal antibiotic produced by a new marine bacterium, pseudoalteromonas phenolica sp. nov. o-bc30(t), against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
we previously reported a new marine bacterium, pseudoalteromonas phenolica sp. nov. o-bc30(t), which produced a bactericidal antibiotic against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). in the present study, we purified an anti-mrsa substance (mc21-a) from the methanol extract of the cells of p. phenolica o-bc30(t) and analyzed its chemical structure. mc21-a was determined to be 3,3',5,5'-tetrabromo-2,2'-biphenyldiol by spectrometric analyses. its anti-mrsa activity against 10 clinical isolates of mrsa was comparable to that of vancomycin (mc21-a mics, 1 to 2 micro g/ml; vancomycin mics, <0.25 to 2 micro g/ml). this substance was also high active against enterococcus serolicida, enterococcus faecium, and enterococcus faecalis but was less active against streptococcus spp. a time-kill study also demonstrated that mc21-a was bactericidal and that its killing rate was much higher than that of vancomycin. the postantibiotic effect (pae) of mc21-a against a clinical mrsa isolate, strain e 31243, was also comparable to that of vancomycin (mc21-a paes, 1.46 to 1.65 h; vancomycin paes, 0.84 to 1.43 h). however, a lysis experiment demonstrated that this substance failed to lyse mrsa cells. this substance also did not lyse human erythrocytes. a sytox green staining experiment implied that this substance permeabilized the cell membrane of mrsa as its mode of action. when its activities against a hypersensitive escherichia coli mutant (ko 1489) and wild-type strains were tested, mc21-a exhibited higher levels of activity against the former. furthermore, mc21-a was not cytotoxic to human normal fibroblast, rat pheochromocytoma, and vero cells at concentrations up to 50 micro g/ml. these results suggest that mc21-a might be useful as a lead compound in the development of new types of anti-mrsa substances with modes of action different from those of vancomycin and teicoplanin.
the lactoperoxidase system increases efficacy of high-pressure inactivation of foodborne bacteria.
the inactivation of eight different bacteria comprising escherichia coli lmm1010  and mg1655, respectively a pressure-resistant strain and the corresponding wild-type, salmonella typhimurium, pseudomonas fluorescens, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua and lactobacillus plantarum, by high hydrostatic pressure in skim milk supplemented with the lactoperoxidase-hydrogen peroxide-thiocyanate (lp) system at naturally occurring concentration was studied. in the absence of pressure treatment, the lp system had either no effect, i.e. on s. typhimurium and e. coli lmm1010, a growth inhibiting effect, i.e. on e. coli mg1655, l. innocua, s. aureus, l. plantarum and e. faecalis, or a bactericidal effect, i.e. on p. fluorescens. the presence of the lp system affected inactivation by high pressure in a cell density-dependent manner. at low cell concentration (10(6) cfu/ml), the lp system strongly increased high-pressure inactivation as measured immediately after pressure treatment of all bacteria except the pressure-resistant e. coli. at high cell density (10(9) cfu/ml), only inactivation of l. innocua, e. faecalis and l. plantarum were enhanced. for both e. coli strains, the fate of the bacteria during 24 h following pressure treatment was also studied. it was found that in the presence of the lp system, considerable further inactivation occurred in the first hours after pressure treatment. the potential of the lp system to improve the bactericidal efficiency of high-pressure treatment for food preservation is discussed.
[comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2000). ii. background of patients].
five-hundred eighty eight bacterial strains isolated from 435 patients diagnosed  as having urinary tract infections (utis) in 10 institutions in japan were supplied between august 2000 and july 2001. then, the clinical background of patients were investigated such as sex, age, and type of infections, infections and kind of bacteria, frequency of bacteria isolation by age and infections, bacteria and infections by timing of antibiotics administration, and bacteria and infections by surgical procedures. about the relationship between age and sex of patients and type of infections, the number of male patients aged less than 50 years was few, and complicated utis without indwelling catheter was the most frequent. in females, the number of patients aged less than 20 years was few. the majority of female patients aged 40 years and over had complicated utis while uncomplicated utis was most frequent in the patients being twenties. as for type of infections and kind of bacteria, escherichia coli decreased when the infections became complicated, and pseudomonas aeruginosa increased when the infection became complicated. enterococcus faecalis was isolated more frequently in complicated utis than in uncomplicated utis. considering this result by age of patients, isolated frequency of e. coli was gradually decreased with aging in patients aged 20 years and over with uncomplicated utis or complicated utis without indwelling catheter. the isolated frequencies of klebsiella spp., p. aeruginosa, and e. faecalis were high in the patients with complicated utis without indwelling catheter. in the patients aged 70 years and over with complicated utis with indwelling catheter, p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis were frequently isolated. as for type of causative organisms in utis before and after the administration of antibiotics, the isolation of bacteria was remarkably decreased after administration in the patients with uncomplicated utis and complicated utis without indwelling catheter. e. coli decreased after administration of antibiotics, and p. aeruginosa increased after administration in the patients with all types of infections. as for type of causative organisms in utis and surgical procedures, e. coli was frequently isolated in the patients without surgery in all types of infections, while p. aeruginosa was frequently isolated in the patients who underwent surgery. in uncomplicated utis, proteus spp. and e. faecalis were frequently isolated in the patients with surgery. in complicated utis without indwelling catheter, klebsiella spp. was frequently isolated in the patients without surgery and e. faecalis was frequently isolated in the patients with surgery. in complicated utis with indwelling catheter, most of organisms except p. aeruginosa and s. aureus were frequently isolated in the patients without surgery.
in vitro bactericidal activity of piperacillin, gentamicin, and metronidazole in  a mixed model containing escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, and bacteroides fragilis.
an anaerobic, mixed model assay was used to study the bactericidal activities of  piperacillin, gentamicin, and metronidazole, alone and in double- and triple-antibiotic combinations against a polymicrobial suspension of e. coli, e. faecalis, and b. fragilis. only slight differences were noted with the agents when tested against single (10(5) cfu/ml inoculum) versus polymicrobic suspensions (10(6) cfu/ml final inoculum) of susceptible and resistant organisms. contrary to previous reports in the literature, metronidazole was not active against e. coli in an anaerobic environment (even in the presence of b. fragilis) nor was the activity of metronidazole reduced against b. fragilis in the presence of e. faecalis. gentamicin demonstrated excellent activity against e. coli when tested in a bactron anaerobic chamber (5% hydrogen, 5% co(2,) 90% nitrogen). the ph of the media was only reduced to 6.3-6.7, considerably higher than the ph range of 5-6 needed to significantly reduce the activity of aminoglycosides.
nb2001, a novel antibacterial agent with broad-spectrum activity and enhanced potency against beta-lactamase-producing strains.
enzyme-catalyzed therapeutic activation (ecta) is a novel prodrug strategy to overcome drug resistance resulting from enzyme overexpression. beta-lactamase overexpression is a common mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. we present here the results for one of the beta-lactamase ecta compounds, nb2001, which consists of the antibacterial agent triclosan in a prodrug form with a cephalosporin scaffold. unlike conventional beta-lactam antibiotics, where hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring inactivates the antibiotic, hydrolysis of nb2001 by beta-lactamase releases triclosan. evidence supporting the proposed mechanism is as follows. (i) nb2001 is a substrate for tem-1 beta-lactamase, forming triclosan with a second-order rate constant (k(cat)/k(m)) of greater than 77,000 m-1 s-1. (ii) triclosan is detected in nb2001-treated, beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli but not in e. coli that does not express beta-lactamase. (iii) nb2001 activity against beta-lactamase-producing e. coli is decreased in the presence of the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. nb2001 was similar to or more potent than reference antibiotics against clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (including mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae. nb2001 is also active against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae. the results indicate that nb2001 is a potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent and demonstrate the potential of ecta in overcoming beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.
effects of flavophospholipol on resistance in fecal escherichia coli and enterococci of fattening pigs.
a "plasmid-curing effect" of multiresistant escherichia coli by flavophospholipol, an antibiotic used as an antimicrobial growth promoter (amgp) in animal feeds, has been reported to occur in vitro and in vivo under experimental conditions. in this study, the effect of flavophospholipol under field conditions was studied. the prevalence and degree (proportion of resistant strains to the total numbers present per gram of feces) of resistance of indicator bacteria, e. coli and enterococci, was determined in fecal samples from three groups of pigs that were fed a commercial finisher feed without any amgp. group a was the negative control group without any amgp, group b received the same feed with 9 mg of flavophospholipol/kg of feed (study group), and group c received the same feed with 15 mg of avoparcin/kg (positive control). fecal samples from each pig were collected at the start and at the end of the study and assessed for the prevalence and degree of resistance against antibiotics commonly used either for therapy in pig medicine or as an amgp. before the start of the study, all pigs were colonized with multiresistant e. coli by mixing three resistant pig isolates through their feed after disturbance of the colonization resistance of the intestinal flora by a 3-day course of lincomycin and spectinomycin. at the end of the study, the overall prevalence and degree of resistance of e. coli in the fecal flora had increased significantly in groups a and c but remained at the same level as at the start of the study in group b. the prevalence of vancomycin resistance was 44 and 41% in groups a and b, respectively, but only very low numbers of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) per gram of feces were found. in the avoparcin-fed group, the prevalence was 72%, and in 57% of the samples, more than 50% of all enterococci present were vancomycin resistant. the prevalence of resistant enterococcus faecalis increased only in the flavophospholipol-exposed group, from 23% before the start of the study to 43% at the end of the study. it was concluded that flavophospholipol effectively suppressed the augmentation and dissemination of multiresistant e. coli in the intestinal flora of fattening pigs. avoparcin use strongly selected for vre carriage and excretion. therefore, as neither flavophospholipol nor any related molecule is used therapeutically, no cross-resistance with therapeutic antibiotics exists and no transmissible resistance has been shown; the major decrease in resistance in intestinal e. coli of flavophospholipol-fed animals seemed to outweigh the small increase in the risk of transfer of flavophospholipol-resistant e. faecalis from animals to humans via the food chain.
pre-inoculation of urinary catheters with escherichia coli 83972 inhibits catheter colonization by enterococcus faecalis.
purpose: the capacity of a preexisting coating of escherichia coli 83972 to reduce catheter colonization by enterococcus faecalis 210 was investigated. enterococcus was chosen for these trials since it is a common urinary pathogen in patients with an indwelling urinary catheter. materials and methods: each experiment tested 3 growth conditions. group 1 or e. coli plus enterococcus catheters were exposed to e. coli 83972 for 24 hours and then to enterococcus for 30 minutes. group 2 or e. coli alone catheters were incubated in e. coli for 24 hours and then in sterile broth for 30 minutes. group 3 or enterococcus alone catheters did not undergo the initial incubation with e. coli before the 30-minute incubation with enterococcus: all catheters were then incubated in sterile human urine for 24 hours. catheters were washed with saline and cut into 5, 1 cm. segments. each segment was sonicated and the sonication fluid was diluted and plated. the results of each of the 5 segments were averaged and the set of experiments was repeated 7 times. results: a preexisting coating of e. coli 83972 reduced catheter colonization by e. faecalis 210 more than 10-fold. enterococcus alone catheters had a median of 9.7 x 10(5) enterococci per cm., whereas e. coli plus enterococcus catheters had a median of 0.38 x 10(5) enterococci per cm. (p = 0.016). conclusions: pre-inoculating urinary catheters with e. coli 83972 significantly impedes catheter colonization by enterococcus: these promising in vitro results prompt the clinical investigation of this particular application of bacterial interference.
in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against common clinical bacterial isolates in taiwan.
the in vitro antimicrobial activities of moxifloxacin were compared with 7 other  antimicrobial agents. a total of 707 isolates of 11 common pathogenic bacteria were collected from the national taiwan university hospital; antimicrobial activities against these isolates were evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration using an agar-dilution method. most common pathogenic bacteria were susceptible to moxifloxacin, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. for many of these bacterial species, moxifloxacin was the most active antimicrobial agent compared with the third- and fourth- generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactam, and other quinolones. some strains of methicillin-resistant s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis demonstrated very low levels of minimum inhibitory concentration for moxifloxacin, suggesting the potential application of the drug to treat some drug-resistant gram-positive bacterial infections. moxifloxacin was less active against p. aeruginosa, but was more active against s. maltophilia when compared with other fluoroquinolones. in conclusion, moxifloxacin exhibits an increased potency against gram-positive bacteria as compared with other tested antimicrobial agents, while preserving excellent activity against gram-negative bacteria. the drug appears to be a promising agent expressing activity against a wide variety of bacteria in taiwan.
antibacterial activity of traditional australian medicinal plants.
fifty-six ethanolic extracts of various parts of 39 plants used in traditional australian aboriginal medicine were investigated for their antibacterial activities against four gram-positive (bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes) and four gram-negative (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium) bacterial species. in a plate-hole diffusion assay, 12 extracts inhibited the growth of one or more of the bacteria, with five extracts showing broad spectrum antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria. b. cereus was the most susceptible bacterium, with all 12 extracts displaying activity against this organism. extracts from the leaves of eremophila species (myoporaceae) were the most active, with eremophila duttonii exhibiting the greatest activity (against gram-positive bacteria). the antibacterial effects of e. duttonii were further investigated by time-course growth assays which showed that significant growth inhibition was observed in cultures incubated in the presence of the extract within 1 h for b. cereus, e. faecalis and s. aureus and 2 h for s. pyogenes.
[comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1999). iii. secular changes in susceptibility].
the bacteria (enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa) isolated from patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (utis) in 9 institutions in japan were supplied between the period of august 1999 to july 2000. then, the susceptibilities of these bacteria to various antimicrobial agents were examined and the results were compared with those obtained between 1991 and 1998. comparison was made by classifying strains isolated from patients into those with uncomplicated utis and those with complicated utis (including with or without indwelling catheter). about e. faecalis, increase of low sensitive strains noted in the former year showed a decreasing tendency, however, one strain each with mic of 4 micrograms/ml to vancomycin (vcm) was detected in patients with both uncomplicated and complicated utis. as for s. aureus, many sensitive strains to cephems, imipenem (ipm) and vcm were noted, and each mic50 was better than that in the former years. s. aureus strains showing low susceptibility to arbekacin (abk) were detected in patients with complicated utis in this year as well as in the former year, and one strain each with mic of 16 micrograms/ml and 32 micrograms/ml was detected. susceptibilities of e. coli were effective to all drugs except for penicillins and minocycline (mino). decrease of low sensitive strains was also noted in all drugs except for quinolones. each mic90 of ciprofloxacin (cpfx) and sparfloxacin (spfx) in patients with complicated utis against e. coli was 3 degrees classes lower than that in patients with uncomplicated utis. as for klebsiella pneumoniae, decrease of low sensitive strains to cephems was noted in patients with uncomplicated utis in 1998. in 1999, low sensitive strains decreased also in patients with complicated utis, and few were detected. susceptibilities of k. pneumoniae to quinolones were effective as compared with those in the former years with the mic80s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below without detection of low sensitive strains. one low sensitive strain of k. pneumoniae with mic of 8 micrograms/ml was detected for gentamicin (gm). susceptibilities of p. aeruginosa to carbapenems were notable. the mic90 of meropenem (mepm) and ipm was 4 micrograms/ml each which was 2 degrees better than that in 1998. resistant p. aeruginosa strains to other drugs except for monobactams decreased in 1999.
[comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1999). ii. background of patients].
five-hundred forty four bacterial strains isolated from 412 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (utis) in 9 institutions in japan were supplied between the period of august 1999 to july 2000. then, the clinical background of patients were investigated such as sex, age and type of infections, infections and kind of bacteria, frequency of isolation of bacteria by age and infections, bacteria and infections by timing of administration of antibiotics, and bacteria and infections by surgical procedures. about the relationship between age and sex of patients and type of infections, the number of male patients aged less than 50 years was few, and complicated utis without indwelling catheter was the most frequent. in females, the number of patients aged less than 20 years was few. complicated utis without indwelling catheter was the most frequent among female patients aged between 40 to 59 years, in other age groups, uncomplicated utis was most frequent. as for type of infections and kind of bacteria, escherichia coli decreased when the infections became complicated, and pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis increased when the infection became complicated. considering this result by age of patients, isolation frequency of e. coli was gradually decreased with aging in patients aged more than 20 years with uncomplicated utis or complicated utis without indwelling catheter. the isolation frequencies of e. faecalis and staphylococcus aureus were gradually increased with aging in complicated utis without indwelling catheter. in patients with complicated utis with indwelling catheter, there was no difference between age group, and p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis were frequently isolated. as for type of causative organisms in utis before and after the administration of antibiotics, the isolation of bacteria was remarkably decreased after administration in patients with uncomplicated utis and complicated utis without indwelling catheter. e. coli decreased after administration of antibiotics, and p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis increased after administration in patients with all infections. as for type of causative organisms in utis and surgical procedures, e. coli were more frequently isolated in patients with uncomplicated utis when surgical procedures were experienced. also, klebsiella spp. and e. faecalis were more frequently isolated in patients with surgical procedures. however, in complicated utis, type of causative organisms had no relationship with surgical procedures.
[comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1999). i. susceptibility distribution].
the bacterial strains isolated from patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (utis) in 9 institutions in japan were supplied between the period of august 1999 to july 2000. then, the susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. the number of them were 499 strains. the breakdown of these strains was gram-positive bacteria as 31.3% and gram-negative bacteria as 68.7%. susceptibilities of these bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as follows; vancomycin (vcm), ampicillin (abpc) and imipenem (ipm) showed strong activities against enterococcus faecalis. the increase of low-susceptible strains which was noticed in the former year showed a slight recovery in this year. vcm showed a strong activity against mrsa preventing growth of all strains with 1 microgram/ml. in addition, the activity of arbekacin (abk) was also strong with the mic90 of 2 micrograms/ml against mrsa. however, mssa and mrsa showing low susceptibilities were detected in one strain each (mic: 16 micrograms/ml and 32 micrograms/ml, respectively). carbapenems showed high activities against citrobacter freundii and escherichia coli. meropenem (mepm) prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/ml. quinolone resistant e. coli decreased in this year compared with those in the last year, that percentage was less than 5%. almost all drugs showed strong activities against klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis. mepm and carumonam (crmn) prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/ml. on the other hand, one strain of k. pneumoniae showing resistance to cefaclor (ccl) and one strain of p. mirabilis showing low susceptibility to most of cephems were detected. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, almost drugs were not so active. the mic90s of carbapenems were 8 micrograms/ml and those of all other drugs were more than 16 micrograms/ml.
antibacterial activity of leaf essential oils and their constituents from cinnamomum osmophloeum.
the antibacterial activities of the essential oils from leaves of two cinnamomum  osmophloeum clones (a and b) and their chemical constituents were investigated in this study. the nine strains of bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella sp., and vibrio parahemolyticus, were used in the antibacterial tests. results from the antibacterial tests demonstrated that the indigenous cinnamon b leaf essential oils had an excellent inhibitory effect. the mics (minimum inhibitory concentrations) of the b leaf oil were 500 microg/ml against both k. pneumoniae and salmonella sp. and 250 microg/ml against the other seven strains of bacteria. cinnamaldehyde possessed the strongest antibacterial activity compared to the other constituents of the essential oils. the mics of cinnamaldehyde against the e. coli, p. aeruginosa, e. faecalis, s. aureus, s. epidermidis, mrsa, k. pneumoniae, salmonella sp., and v. parahemolyticus were 500, 1000, 250, 250, 250, 250, 1000, 500, and 250 microg/ml, respectively. these results suggest that c. osmophloeum leaf essential oil and cinnamaldehyde are beneficial to human health, having the potential to be used for medical purposes and to be utilized as anti-bacterial additives in making paper products.
etiologies of the urinary tract infections in a yemeni city.
objective: to determine the causative agents of urinary tract infection in yemeni patients in sana'a city, and to determine the antibiotic susceptibilities of these agents in vitro. methods: consecutive mid-stream urine specimens were submitted to our laboratory by 4029 patients in sana'a city from 1990 to the end of 1999. the specimens were cultured and the isolates were identified using standard microbiological techniques. the antibiotic susceptibilities of the isolates were also determined (in vitro). results: the number of patients with urinary tract infection who yielded positive cultures from their mid stream urine specimens was 685 out of 4029 patients (17%). the ratio of female-to-male patients was 462:223 (2.07:1). the causative agents were mainly members of the family enterobacteriaceae, 579 out of the 685 isolates (84.5%). escherichia coli was the main pathogen, 357 isolates out of all the isolates (52%) followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, 143 isolates (21%) and proteus species, 56 isolates (8%). the other pathogens (staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, staphylococcus saprophyticus, corynebacterium urealyticum and enterococcus faecalis) constituted 129 out of the 685 isolates (19%). there was a shift in the types of the causative agents of urinary tract infection between the first and 2nd halves of the study period. the isolation of escherichia coli decreased from 60% in the first half to 42% in the 2nd. whereas klebsiella pneumoniae increased from 16% in the first half to 27% in the 2nd, proteus species from 8% to 9%, staphylococcus aureus from 5% to 7%, pseudomonas aeruginosa from 3% to 7%, enterobacter aerogenes from 3% to 3.5%, staphylococcus saprophyticus from 2% to 3% and corynebacterium urealyticum from 1% to 2%. ninety percent of all the urinary pathogens were sensitive to ciprofloxacin, 75% to nitrofurantoin, 57% to gentamicin, 46% to cefaclor, 46% to nalidixic acid, 39% to doxycycline, 37% to co-trimoxazole and 20% to ampiclox. conclusion: the types of urinary tract pathogens and their antibiotic susceptibilities in addition to the rate of isolation from male and female patients are reported. it is recommended that ciprofloxacin and nitrofurantoin or both are used in the blind treatment of urinary tract infection while awaiting the culture and sensitivity results. it is also recommended to continuously monitor the pattern of urinary pathogens from the community to guide the blind treatment of patients in the future.
activity of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against urinary pathogens.
this study compares the antibacterial activities of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against recently isolated urinary tract pathogens, by evaluating their mics and mbcs in accordance with nccls susceptibility tests, time-kill curves and interference with bacterial adhesion to uroepithelial cells. a total of 200 clinical isolates was tested, including the species escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, providencia rettgeri, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. all e. coli isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin and only one was resistant to ciprofloxacin, and there were no differences between beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains. k. pneumoniae strains resistant to ciprofloxacin were also resistant to levofloxacin. methicillin-resistant s. aureus seemed to be less susceptible than methicillin-susceptible strains to these quinolones. s. epidermidis strains were susceptible to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, with the exception of two isolates. incubation of s. aureus and e. coli with subinhibitory antimicrobial concentrations reduced their capacity to adhere to uroepithelial cells; this was statistically significant at 0.25 x mic with respect to controls (p < 0.05). inhibition of adhesion ranged from 36 to 43% when bacteria were incubated in the presence of 0.25 x mic of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, and from 10 to 27% at 0.125 x mic. these findings suggest that levofloxacin is an effective alternative to ciprofloxacin in the treatment of urinary tract infections and that sub-inhibitory concentrations may contribute to efficacy.
antimicrobial susceptibility of intestinal bacteria from swiss poultry flocks before the ban of antimicrobial growth promoters.
from the crop and the caecum of swiss broilers slaughtered between november 1997  and january 1998, escherichia coli, enterococci, staphylococci, lactobacilli and campylobacter species were isolated. after identification to the genus or species level, their minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic's) for several clinically used antimicrobial agents were determined with the e-test stripes and compared to those from studies in other european countries. all strains of enterococcus faecalis (n = 38), e. faecium (27), staphylococci (n = 39) and lactobacilli (n = 14) showed a hundred percent resistance against bacitracin which was included in the feed of the mother animals, but not in the feed of the investigated animals. e.coli strains (n = 60) showed higher resistance incidences than in comparable studies from finland and denmark, but lower than those in studies from italy and germany. in staphylococci, low resistance rates were observed. a high susceptibility of the 13 campylobacter jejuni strains was found against therapeutically used antimicrobials. these data can be used as a baseline to determine antibiotic resistance rates after implementation of the growth promotor ban in 1999 in switzerland.
antibacterial activity of synthetic analogues based on the disaccharide structure of moenomycin, an inhibitor of bacterial transglycosylase.
moenomycin is a natural product glycolipid that inhibits the growth of a broad spectrum of gram-positive bacteria. in escherichia coli, moenomycin inhibits peptidoglycan synthesis at the transglycosylation stage, causes accumulation of cell-wall intermediates, and leads to lysis and cell death. however, unlike esc. coli, where 5-6 log units of killing are observed, 0-2 log units of killing occurred when gram-positive bacteria were treated with similar multiples of the mic. in addition, bulk peptidoglycan synthesis in intact gram-positive cells was resistant to the effects of moenomycin. in contrast, synthetic disaccharides based on the moenomycin disaccharide core structure were identified that were bactericidal to gram-positive bacteria, inhibited cell-wall synthesis in intact cells, and were active on both sensitive and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. these disaccharide analogues do not inhibit the formation of n:-acetylglucosamine-ss-1, 4-murnac-pentapeptide-pyrophosphoryl-undecaprenol (lipid ii), but do inhibit the polymerization of lipid ii into peptidoglycan in esc. coli. in addition, cell growth was required for bactericidal activity. the data indicate that synthetic disaccharide analogues of moenomycin inhibit cell-wall synthesis at the transglycosylation stage, and that their activity on gram-positive bacteria differs from moenomycin due to differential targeting of the transglycosylation process. inhibition of the transglycosylation process represents a promising approach to the design of new antibacterial agents active on drug-resistant bacteria.
characterization of reutericyclin produced by lactobacillus reuteri lth2584.
lactobacillus reuteri lth2584 exhibits antimicrobial activity that can be attributed neither to bacteriocins nor to the production of reuterin or organic acids. we have purified the active compound, named reutericyclin, to homogeneity and characterized its antimicrobial activity. reutericyclin exhibited a broad inhibitory spectrum including lactobacillus spp., bacillus subtilis, b. cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and listeria innocua. it did not affect the growth of gram-negative bacteria; however, the growth of lipopolysaccharide mutant strains of escherichia coli was inhibited. reutericyclin exhibited a bactericidal mode of action against lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, staphylococcus aureus, and b. subtilis and triggered the lysis of cells of l. sanfranciscensis in a dose-dependent manner. germination of spores of b. subtilis was inhibited, but the spores remained unaffected under conditions that do not permit germination. the fatty acid supply of the growth media had a strong effect on reutericyclin production and its distribution between producer cells and the culture supernatant. reutericyclin was purified from cell extracts and culture supernatant of l. reuteri lth2584 cultures grown in mmrs by solvent extraction, gel filtration, rp-c(8) chromatography, and anion-exchange chromatography, followed by rechromatography by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. reutericyclin was characterized as a negatively charged, highly hydrophobic molecule with a molecular mass of 349 da. structural characterization (a. holtzel, m. g. ganzle, g. j. nicholson, w. p. hammes, and g. jung, angew. chem. int. ed. 39:2766-2768, 2000) revealed that reutericyclin is a novel tetramic acid derivative. the inhibitory activity of culture supernatant of l. reuteri lth2584 corresponded to that of purified as well as synthetic reutericyclin.
bacteriostatic effects of cerium-humic acid complex: an experimental study.
the bacteriostatic potency of the cerium-humic acid complex was evaluated by experimental measurement of this complex interaction with e. coli, bacillus pyocyaneus, staphylococcus aureus, leuconostoc and streptococcus faecalis, and by comparison bacteriostatic effects with the cerium-citrate complex. the experimental results indicated that the cerium-humic acid complex strongly inhibited growth of all five bacterial strains, and its diameter of bacteriostatic circles were more than 30 mm. the minimal bacteria-inhibiting concentration were 1 x 10(-3), 2 x 10(-3) and 1 x 10(-2) mol/l for e. coli and bacillus pyocyaneus, staphylococcus aureus, and leuconostoc and streptococcus faecalis individually, and the measured minimal bactericidal concentrations were 2 x 10(-3) and 1 x 10(-2) mol/l for bacillus pyocyaneus, e. coli, and leuconostoc. to kill staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis, the concentration had to be more than 1 x 10(-20 mol/l. on the contrary, we found that cerium-citrate complex did not inhibit the growth of the above five bacteria, but stimulated bacterial growth. the completely different bacteriostatic results of two cerium complexes may hint that the association and chemical properties of the two complexes were different.
[the primary screening of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli strains to develop effective probiotic preparations based on them].
10 bifidobacterium strains and 10 lactobacillus strains were studied for their antagonistic activity with respect to escherichia coli, klebsiella ozaenae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and for their sensitivity to antibiotics, widely used in clinical practice. l. acidophilus strain 5/4, l. acidophilus strain 18/4, b. adolescentis strain ux, b. longum strain 44 exhibited the highest antagonistic activity and the highest degree of antibiotic resistance. the restriction analysis of the chromosomal dna of these strains was then made and their plasmid content was studied, making it possible to recognize these strains in future in the course of in vivo experiments.
in vitro antimicrobial activity of gatifloxacin against 873 clinical isolates from respiratory tract, urinary tract and surgical infections during 1997-1998 in japan.
the in vitro activity of gatifloxacin was determined for 873 isolates from various infections during 1997-1998 in japan. gatifloxacin was active against streptococci, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae, with mic(90)s of </=0.39 mg/l. the activity was two- to 32-fold greater than that of ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against gram-positive bacteria, and comparable to that against gram-negative bacteria. gatifloxacin was more active than the other quinolones against quinolone-resistant staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, e. coli and enterobacter cloacae. it also had good activity against penicillin- or macrolide-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae.
enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against ent. faecalis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. sake, listeria innocua, propionibacterium acidipropionici, propionibacterium sp., clostridium perfringens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium. one of the four pathogenic strains of escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. no antimicrobial activity was recorded against bacillus cereus, cl. sporogenes, cl. tyrobutyricum, leuconostoc cremoris, pediococcus pentosaceus, staphylococcus carnosus and streptococcus thermophilus. enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to proteinase k, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees c for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a ph of 1.0-5.0 and ph 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 au ml-1, but increased further to 1600 au ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. the peptide is approximately 3.4 kda in size, as determined after partial purification with amberlite xad-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the mechanism of antimicrobial activity against lact. sake lmg 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.
in vitro antibacterial activity of fk041, a new orally active cephalosporin.
the in vitro activity of fk041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with those of cefdinir (cfdn) and cefditoren (cdtr). fk041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk041 was active against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms except enterococcus faecalis with mic90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. fk041 was more active than cfdn and cdtr against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to cfdn and cdtr against streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. fk041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae with an mic range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to cfdn but inferior to cdtr. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative organisms such as neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis, fk041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of cfdn and cdtr. however, it was inferior to cdtr in activity against moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, morganella morganii, and serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. with fk041 a small difference between mic and mbc against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and h. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. fk041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. the stability of fk041 to these enzymes was similar to those of cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) of s. aureus (pbp 3, 2, and 1) and e. coli (pbp 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).
surveillance of antibiotic resistance in icus in southeastern sweden. icu study group of the south east of sweden.
background: a study was designed to assess a computer-based program for continuous registration of antibiotic resistance, statistics concerning severity of illness, and consumption of antibacterial drugs. methods: the frequency of antibiotic resistance among bacteria in eight icus in southeastern sweden was investigated yearly from 1995 through 1997. the antibiotic consumption in the icus was registered as defined daily doses (ddd) and compared to severity of illness (apache-ii scores). results: there was a statistically significant increase in ampicillin resistance among enterococcus spp. between 1996 and 1997, which was due to a shift from enterococcus faecalis to enterococcus faecium. a high prevalence of resistance among coagulase-negative staphylococci to oxacillin (approximately 70%), ciprofloxacin (approximately 50%), fucidic acid (approximately 50%) and netilmicin (approximately 30%) was seen in all icus during the whole study period. there was a statistically significant increase in ciprofloxacin resistance among escherichia coli and enterococcus spp. the resistance among enterobacter spp. to cefotaxime decreased but this change was not statistically significant. efforts were made to avoid betalactam antibiotics, except carbapenems, for treatment of infections caused by enterobacter spp. and the consumption of cephalosporins decreased whereas the consumption of carbapenems increased. the total antibiotic consumption decreased by 2.5% during the study period. there was no correlation between apache ii scores and antibiotic consumption. conclusions: each icu within a hospital ought to have a program for "on-line" antibiotic resistance surveillance of drugs used in that unit so that changes in empirical treatment can be made when there is an increase in antibiotic-resistant isolates within that unit.
verifying apple cider plant sanitation and hazard analysis critical control point programs: choice of indicator bacteria and testing methods.
the objectives of this study were (i) to evaluate the survival of coliforms, escherichia coli, and enterococci in refrigerated apple cider; (ii) to develop simple and inexpensive presumptive methods for detection of these bacteria; (iii) to perform a field survey to determine the prevalence of these bacteria on apples and in apple cider; and (iv) based on our results, to recommend the most useful of these three indicator groups for use in verifying apple cider processing plant sanitation and hazard analysis critical control point (haccp) programs. eight of 10 coliform strains (5 e. coli, 1 enterobacter aerogenes, and 2 klebsiella spp.) inoculated into preservative-free apple cider (ph 3.4, 13.3(o) brix) survived well at 4 degrees c for 6 days (< or = 3.0 log10 cfu/ml decrease). of 21 enterococci strains (enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and e. durans), only 2 e. durans and 3 e. faecium strains survived well. simple broth-based colorimetric methods were developed that detected the presence of approximately 10 cells of coliforms or enterococci. in three field studies, samples of unwashed apples (drops and picked), washed apples, and freshly pressed cider were presumptively analyzed for total coliforms, e. coli, and enterococci using qualitative and/or quantitative methods. drop apples were more likely than picked apples to be contaminated with e. coli (26.7% vs. 0%) and enterococci (20% vs. 0%). washing had little effect on coliform populations and in one field study was associated with increased numbers. total coliform populations in cider ranged from < 1 cfu/ml to > 738 most probable number/ml, depending on the enumeration method used and the sample origin. e. coli was not recovered from washed apples or cider, but enterococci were present on 13% of washed apple samples. the qualitative coliform method successfully detected these bacteria on apples and in cider. based on its exclusively fecal origin, good survival in apple cider, and association with drop apples, we conclude that e. coli is the most useful organism for verifying apple cider sanitation and haccp programs.
[comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1997). iii secular changes in susceptibility].
susceptibilities to various antimicrobial agents were examined for enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, echerichia coli, klebsiella spp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa that were isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (utis) in 9 hospitals during june 1997 to may 1998, and the results were compared with those obtained during the same period in earlier years. 1. e. faecalis the mic90s of quinolones for e. faecalis isolated from uncomplicated utis have changed better state during the latest period. among e. faecalis strains, those with high susceptibilities to ampicillin (abpc) and minocycline (mino) appeared to had decreased during period of 1995-1997, which recovered during the latest period. 2. s. aureus the sensitive strains of s. aureus to imipenem (ipm) and clindamycin (cldm) had increased during the period of 1996-1997, but those have decreased again during the latest period. 3. e. coli the susceptibilities of e. coli to mino have been better in the latest period with the mic90 was ranged from 2 to 4 micrograms/ml. the susceptibilities to quinolones of e. coli isolated from complicated utis had decreased during the period of 1995-1997, but those have recovered during the latest period. 4. klebsiella spp. among klebsiella spp. strains isolated from uncomplicated utis, those with low susceptibilities to almost cephems have increased in the latest period. to other antimicrobial agents, the susceptibilities of klebsiella spp. did not show any changes during the latest period. 5. p. aeruginosa the susceptibilities to most agents of p. aeruginosa did not show any changes, the decreased susceptibilities to cefozopran (czop), carbapenems and monobactams of p. aeruginosa observed in 1996 appeared to have been retrieved in 1997. these susceptibility changes should be utilized in determining clinical treatments.
survival of enterococcus faecalis in mouse peritoneal macrophages.
enterococcus faecalis was tested for the ability to persist in mouse peritoneal macrophages in two separate studies. in the first study, the intracellular survival of serum-passaged e. faecalis 418 and two isogenic mutants [cytolytic strain fa2-2(pam714) and non-cytolytic strain fa2-2(pam771)] was compared with that of escherichia coli dh5alpha by infecting balb/c mice intraperitoneally and then monitoring the survival of the bacteria within lavaged peritoneal macrophages over a 72-h period. all e. faecalis isolates were serum passaged to enhance the production of cytolysin. e. faecalis 418, fa2-2(pam714), and fa2-2(pam771) survived at a significantly higher level (p = 0.0001) than did e. coli dh5alpha at 24, 48, and 72 h. internalized e. faecalis 418, fa2-2(pam714), and fa2-2(pam771) decreased 10-, 55-, and 31-fold, respectively, over the 72-h infection period, while internalized e. coli dh5alpha decreased 20, 542-fold. the difference in the rate of survival of e. faecalis strains and e. coli dh5alpha was most prominent between 6 and 48 h postinfection (p = 0.0001); however, no significant difference in killing was observed between 48 and 72 h postinfection. in the second study, additional e. faecalis strains from clinical sources, including ds16c2, mgh-2, og1x, and the cytolytic strain fa2-2(pam714), were compared with the nonpathogenic gram-positive bacterium, lactococcus lactis k1, for the ability to survive in mouse peritoneal macrophages. in these experiments, the e. faecalis strains and l. lactis k1 were grown in brain heart infusion (bhi) broth to ensure that there were equal quantities of injected bacteria. e. faecalis fa2-2(pam714), ds16c2, mgh-2, and og1x survived significantly better (p < 0.0001) than did l. lactis k1 at each time point. l. lactis k1 was rapidly destroyed by the macrophages, and by 24 h postinfection, viable l. lactis could not be recovered. e. faecalis fa2-2(pam714), ds16c2, mgh-2, and og1x declined at an equivalent rate over the 72-h infection period, and there was no significant difference in survival or rate of decline among the strains. e. faecalis fa2-2(pam714), mgh-2, ds16c2, and og1x exhibited an overall decrease of 25-, 55-, 186-, and 129-fold respectively, between 6 and 72 h postinfection. the overall reduction by 1.3 to 2.27 log units is slightly higher than that seen for serum-passaged e. faecalis strains and may be attributable to the higher level of uptake of serum-passaged e. faecalis than of e. faecalis grown in bhi broth. electron microscopy of infected macrophages revealed that e. faecalis 418 was present within an intact phagocytic vacuole at 6 h postinfection but that by 24 h the infected macrophages were disorganized, the vacuolar membrane was degraded, and the bacterial cells had entered the cytoplasm. macrophage destruction occurred by 48 h, and the bacteria were released. in conclusion, the results of these experiments indicate that e. faecalis can persist for an extended period in mouse peritoneal macrophages.
characterization and heterologous expression of the genes encoding enterocin a production, immunity, and regulation in enterococcus faecium dpc1146.
enterocin a is a small, heat-stable, antilisterial bacteriocin produced by enterococcus faecium dpc1146. the sequence of a 10, 879-bp chromosomal region containing at least 12 open reading frames (orfs), 7 of which are predicted to play a role in enterocin biosynthesis, is presented. the genes enta, enti, and entf encode the enterocin a prepeptide, the putative immunity protein, and the induction factor prepeptide, respectively. the deduced proteins entk and entr resemble the histidine kinase and response regulator proteins of two-component signal transducing systems of the agrc-agra type. the predicted proteins entt and entd are homologous to abc (atp-binding cassette) transporters and accessory factors, respectively, of several other bacteriocin systems and to proteins implicated in the signal-sequence-independent export of escherichia coli hemolysin a. immediately downstream of the entt and entd genes are two orfs, the product of one of which, orf4, is very similar to the product of the ytei gene of bacillus subtilis and to e. coli protease iv, a signal peptide peptidase known to be involved in outer membrane lipoprotein export. another potential bacteriocin is encoded in the opposite direction to the other genes in the enterocin cluster. this putative bacteriocin-like peptide is similar to lafx, one of the components of the lactacin f complex. a deletion which included one of two direct repeats upstream of the enta gene abolished enterocin a activity, immunity, and ability to induce bacteriocin production. transposon insertion upstream of the entf gene also had the same effect, but this mutant could be complemented by exogenously supplied induction factor. the putative enti peptide was shown to be involved in the immunity to enterocin a. cloning of a 10.5-kb amplicon comprising all predicted orfs and regulatory regions resulted in heterologous production of enterocin a and induction factor in enterococcus faecalis, while a four-gene construct (entaitd) under the control of a constitutive promoter resulted in heterologous enterocin a production in both e. faecalis and lactococcus lactis.
detection of a streptomycin/spectinomycin adenylyltransferase gene (aada) in enterococcus faecalis.
genes encoding streptomycin/spectinomycin adenylyltransferases [ant(3")(9)] have  been reported to exist in gram-negative organisms and staphylococcus aureus. during a study of high-level aminoglycoside resistance in enterococci, we encountered an isolate of enterococcus faecalis that was streptomycin resistant but did not appear to contain the 6'-adenylyltransferase gene (aade) when examined by pcr with specific primers. phosphocellulose paper binding assays indicated the presence of an ant(3")(9) enzyme. streptomycin and spectinomycin mics of 4,000 and 8,000 microg/ml, respectively, were observed for the isolate. pcr primers corresponding to a highly conserved region of the aada gene were used to amplify a specific 284-bp product. the product hybridized with a digoxigenin-labeled pcr product from e. coli c600(php45omega) known to contain the aada gene. the aada gene was transferred via filter matings from the e. faecalis donor to e. faecalis jh2-2. pcr primers designed for analysis of integrons were used to amplify a 1-kb product containing the aada gene, which was cloned into the vector pcrii and transformed into escherichia coli dh5-alpha competent cells. d-rhodamine dye terminator cycle sequencing was used to determine the gene sequence, which was compared to previously reported sequences of aada genes. we found the aada gene in e. faecalis to be identical to the aada genes reported by sundstr om et al. for e. coli plasmid r6-5 (l. sundstrom, p. radstrom, g. swedberg, and o. skold, mol. gen. genet. 213:191-201, 1988), by fling et al. for the aada within transposon tn7 (m. e. fling, j. kopf, and c. richards, nucleic acids res. 13:7095-7106, 1985), and by hollingshead and vapnek for e. coli r538-1 (s. hollingshead and d. vapnek, plasmid 13:17-30, 1985). previous reports of the presence of the aada gene in enterococci appear to be erroneous and probably describe an aade gene, since the isolates were reported to be susceptible to spectinomycin.
the preliminary isolation of several antibacterial compounds from combretum erythrophyllum (combretaceae).
freeze dried ground leaves of combretum erythrophyllum were extracted with different extractants to determine if they contain inhibitors of pathogenic bacteria. acetone yielded the most compounds inhibiting the growth of staphylococcus aureus using bioautography of thin layer chromatography plates. acetone also extracted many different compounds and group separation was attempted by solid phase extraction on reverse and normal phase silica gel. both techniques separated the bioactive components to a degree. the best group separation results, however, were obtained using liquid/liquid extraction. the six fractions obtained inhibited the four test organisms to different degrees. s. aureus was the most sensitive (100%) followed by enterococcus faecalis (36%), escherichia coli (11%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (3%). with s. aureus as test organism, the chloroform soluble fraction contained by far the largest quantity of inhibiting components (100%), followed by the fractions soluble in water (23%), 35% methanol in water (18%), butanol (5%), carbon tetrachloride (2%) and hexane (traces). the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration for s. aureus was 0.05 mg/ml at this stage of purification compared to mic values of 0.08 and 0.16 mg/ml for ampicillin and chloramphenicol. there were at least 14 different inhibitors with a wide range of polarities present in the different fractions. the polar components apparently did not contain polysaccharides and were probably basic according to the chromatographic behaviour.
the effect of ph on the inhibition of bacterial growth by physiological concentrations of butyric acid: implications for neonates fed on suckled milk.
butyric acid is released from milk by pre-intestinal lipases during suckling. it  is also known to inhibit bacterial growth. to investigate whether butyric acid may be a significant factor in controlling bacterial growth in the stomach of pre-weaned animals, the ability of butyric acid to inhibit growth of selected bacteria was tested over physiological ranges of ph and butyric acid concentrations. six enteric and environmental strains of bacteria were used: two strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus casseliflavus. at ph 4.5 and 5.0, the growth of all organisms was significantly inhibited in the presence of butyrate, and in some cases growth was completely arrested. at ph 6.0, butyric acid did not affect bacterial growth until the concentration reached 40 mm. the maximum concentration of butyric acid available in cow's milk after incubation with pre-gastric lipase is approximately 16 mm, which would be sufficient to prevent growth of the organisms tested at ph values occurring in the stomach. therefore, butyric acid inhibition of bacterial growth may explain in part, the role of pre-intestinal lipases in young animals' natural defenses against bacteria in ingested food prior to weaning.
toxicity of hydrogen peroxide produced by electroplated coatings to pathogenic bacteria.
the ability of various electroplated coatings (cobalt, zinc, copper, and cobalt-containing alloys of nickel, zinc, chromium, etc.) to inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria (gram-positive bacteria enterococcus faecalis and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae) was determined by a drop-method antibacterial experiment. the amounts of h2o2 produced and metal ions dissolved from the surfaces of various electroplated coatings were measured and it was found that the inhibitory ability of coatings corresponded to the amounts of h2o2 produced. the more significant the inhibition of the coating to bacterial growth, the greater the amount of h2o2 production. in addition, the bacterial survival rates on the surfaces of coatings were almost zero when h2o2 was produced in amounts greater than 10(-6) mmol/cm2. however, the dominant concentrations of metal ions dissolved from coatings were outside of the bacterial lethal range.
urinary bactericidal activity and pharmacokinetics of enoxacin versus norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin in healthy volunteers after a single oral dose.
in an open, randomised monocentric crossover study in six male and six female healthy volunteers, the urinary antibacterial activity and pharmacokinetics of enoxacin, norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were assessed. urine was collected up to 6 days, and venous blood samples up to 12 h, after a single oral dose of 400 mg enoxacin, 400 mg norfloxacin and 500 mg ciprofloxacin. enoxacin (250 mg/l) demonstrated the highest peak concentration (median) in the urine (0-6 h), followed by ciprofloxacin (237 mg/l) and norfloxacin (157 mg/l) as determined by the hplc assay. the total amount (mean) excreted by the kidneys as parent drugs were as follows: enoxacin 54% of dose, ciprofloxacin 33% of dose, and norfloxacin 22% of dose. the mean plasma concentrations decreased from 1 to 4 h after administration for enoxacin from 1.9 to 1.4 mg/l, for ciprofloxacin from 2.0 to 0.8 mg/l and for norfloxacin from 1.3 to 0.5 mg/l. the antibacterial activity in urine was determined as urinary bactericidal titers (ubt), i.e. the highest 2-fold dilution of urine still bactericidal for the reference organism (e. coli atcc 25,922) and for five uropathogens with minimal inhibitory (mic) and bactericidal (mbc) concentrations ranging from highly susceptible to resistant cultured from the urine of patients with complicated urinary tract infections (uti). for the e. coli atcc 25,922, the organism with the lowest mic, median ubts of ciprofloxacin were present for 4 days, decreasing from 1:512 to 1:2, that of enoxacin for 2 days, decreasing from 1:256 to 1:4, and that of norfloxacin for 2 days, decreasing from 1:128 to 1:2. for the five uropathogens (with increasing mics: k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, e. coli (resistant to nalidixic acid), p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis), the ubts decreased in general, according to mics, demonstrating the same relations of ubts for ciprofloxacin (highest) versus enoxacin (medium) versus norfloxacin (lowest) with one exception (p. mirabilis) for which norfloxacin showed higher ubts than enoxacin. the minimal urinary bactericidal concentrations (mubc), as derived from urinary concentrations, and ubts showed a fairly wide inter- and intraindividual range and were generally higher than the corresponding mbcs as determined in mueller hinton broth. in conclusion, according to antibacterial activity in urine determined as ubts, a single oral dose of ciprofloxacin (500 mg) generally resulted in the highest and longest-lasting ubts followed by that of enoxacin (400 mg) and norfloxacin (400 mg). a dose of 400 mg enoxacin can be expected to be at least equivalent if not superior to that of 400 mg norfloxacin. only enoxacin and ciprofloxacin exhibited urinary bactericidal activity against all test organisms up to 12 h in all individuals. therefore, clinical comparison of enoxacin versus ciprofloxacin in the treatment of complicated uti could be worth testing.
in-vitro photobactericidal activity of aminoacridines.
the toxicities of several aminoacridines were measured against pathogenic strains of both gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus) and gram-negative (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa) organisms. in several cases, illumination at a light dose of 6.3 j/cm2 resulted in considerable decreases in the minimum lethal drug concentrations required, giving up to 50-fold increases in bactericidal activity. derivatives of 9-aminoacridine (aminacrine) exhibited phototoxicity against one or more of the test organisms, but the established photosensitizing acridines proflavine and acridine orange were photobactericidal against all strains.
differential induction of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in whole blood by  bacteria: effects of antibiotic treatment.
the in vitro production of interleukin-1beta (il-1beta), il-6, and the il-1 receptor antagonist (il-1ra) in whole blood upon stimulation with different bacterial strains was measured to study the possible relationship between disease severity and the cytokine-inducing capacities of these strains. escherichia coli, neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, bacteroides fragilis, capnocytophaga canimorsus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes induced the cytokines il-1beta, il-6, and il-1ra. gram-negative bacteria induced significantly higher levels of proinflammatory cytokine production than gram-positive bacteria. these differences were less pronounced for the anti-inflammatory cytokine il-1ra. in addition, blood was stimulated with e. coli killed by different antibiotics to study the effect of the antibiotics on the cytokine-inducing capacity of the bacterial culture. e. coli treated with cefuroxime and gentamicin induced higher levels of il-1beta and il-6 production but levels of il-1ra production similar to that of heat-killed e. coli. in contrast, ciprofloxacin- and imipenem-cilastatin-mediated killing showed a decreased or similar level of induction of cytokine production as compared to that by heat-killed e. coli; polymyxin b decreased the level of production of the cytokines.
does tea tree oil have a place in the topical treatment of burns?
burnaid is a sorbalene-based cream containing 40 mg/g of tea tree oil and 1 mg/g  of triclosan. this investigation was carried out to determine the effect of burnaid, a commercial tea tree oil preparation, against enterococcus faecalis (atcc29212), staphylococcus aureus (atcc29213), escherichia coli (atcc25922), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc27853), with the activity of the base product in the commercial preparation. the organisms were suspended in sterile saline (0.5 mcfarland standard) and inoculated onto horse blood agar (e. faecalis and s. aureus) or mueller-hinton agar (e. coli and p. aeruginosa). one hundred microliters of burnaid unsterilized, burnaid sterilized and the base product (tinasolve) were placed in duplicate in wells cut into the agar plates. sterility and inactivation cultures were also performed on the samples. none of the samples were found to be contaminated with bacteria prior to testing. only s. aureus and e. coli showed zones of growth inhibition around the burnaid and tinasolve. zones of growth inhibition (22 mm) were similar for the active product (burnaid) and the base (tinasolve). there was no activity against e. faecalis or p. aeruginosa. in view of our findings and literature indicating the cytotoxicity of tea tree oil against human fibroblasts and epithelial cells, it is recommended that this product should not be used on burn wounds.
in-vitro activity of trovafloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, against recent clinical isolates.
trovafloxacin (cp-99,219) was very active against gram-negative species examined  including haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, legionella spp., neisseria spp. and escherichia coli (mic90s < or = 0.03 mg/l). in general trovafloxacin was twice as active as ofloxacin but only half as active as ciprofloxacin against gram-negative species. trovafloxacin was active against gram-positive organisms, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis (mic90s < or = 0.25 mg/l). against these organisms activity was eight to 16 times greater for trovafloxacin than for either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. in addition, chlamydia spp., mycoplasma spp. and ureaplasma urealyticum were eight to 16 times more susceptible to trovafloxacin than to either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. these in-vitro data show that trovafloxacin is a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone with greater activity against clinically important gram-positive species compared with ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin.
in-vitro microbiological assessment of a new penem, men 10700.
the in-vitro antibacterial activity of men 10700, a novel penem, has been compared with that of ritipenem, ciprofloxacin, amikacin, cefotaxime and co-amoxiclav against 539 strains taken from 17 genera. men 10700 was most active against staphylococci and streptococci (mic90 < 0.5 mg/l), slightly less active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter spp., citrobacter spp., moraxella catarrhalis and peptostreptococci (mic90 0.5-2 mg/l), moderately active against enterococcus faecalis, members of the tribe proteae, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter spp., clostridia and bacteroides spp. (mic90 4-16 mg/l), and inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and enterococcus faecium. its antibacterial spectrum is thus slightly less broad than that of imipenem, but it compares favourably with an oral third-generation cephalosporin. men 10700 was more active than ritipenem against many species, especially enterobacter spp. and citrobacter spp.
urine bactericidal activity of pefloxacin versus norfloxacin in healthy female volunteers after a single 800-mg oral dose.
in an open randomised crossover study the antibacterial activity of pefloxacin and norfloxacin was assessed in the urine after a single 800-mg oral dose in 14 healthy female volunteers. pefloxacin demonstrated lower peak concentrations in the urine than norfloxacin (mean, 217.2 mg/l versus 492.9 mg/l as determined by the microbiological assay) but pefloxacin was present over a longer period of time in sufficient concentrations than norfloxacin. mean urine levels of at least 2 mg/l were present for 7 days after pefloxacin administration and 2 days after norfloxacin administration as determined by the microbiological assay. overall, the urinary recovery of pefloxacin and norfloxacin amounted to 49.3% and 25.1%, respectively, of the total administered dose. the average urine bactericidal activity against the five test organisms was as follows: against reference strain escherichia coli atcc 25922 susceptible to nalidixic acid (nal-s) for 5 days with pefloxacin and 2 days with norfloxacin; against three clinical isolates, one strain each of e. coli resistant to nalidixic acid (nal-r), klebsiella pneumoniae nal-r, and staphylococcus saprophyticus, for 3 days with pefloxacin and 24 h with norfloxacin; and against a clinical isolate of enterococcus faecalis for 2 days with pefloxacin and 12 h with norfloxacin. in conclusion, pefloxacin as a single dose proved to have sufficiently high and long-lasting urine bactericidal activity against urinary pathogens. these findings support the results of a meta-analysis of seven clinical trials in patients with uncomplicated lower uti, demonstrating a single oral dose of 800 mg pefloxacin to be as effective as a conventional treatment with comparative drugs.
urinary tract infection in acute appendicitis.
the effect of acute appendicitis (aa) on aerobic urinary tract infection was investigated. abnormal urinalysis and urinary tract infection in patients with aa have seldom been reported previously. appendectomy was performed in 84 patients with no previous urogenital, retroperitoneal, or pelvic disease, trauma or operation and aa was pathologically confirmed in 66 of them. aerobic cultures of appendiceal tissue and mesenteriolum were done. control groups included 25 patients with inguinal hernioplasty and 40 patients with varicocele repair. urinalysis and urine culture were done prior to operation, and on days 1, 3, and 6 postoperatively. the "o" serogrouping identification of escherichia coli (e. coli) was performed in the appendix, mesenteriolum and urine. abnormal urinalysis was found in 48% of patients with aa before appendectomy, and in 12% on day 6 postoperatively (p < 0.05). aerobes were isolated from urine in 32% of patients before appendectomy and in 24% on day 6 following surgery. e. coli was more often found in the appendix than in the mesenteriolum (p < 0.05). in seven out of 66 patients (11%) bacteriuria of more than 10(5) was found. all of them had identical aerobic strain isolated from the appendix, mesenteriolum and urine (e. coli in 4, streptococcus faecalis in 2 and corynebacterium species in one patient) according to antimicrobial susceptibility testing and "o" serogrouping of e. coli. lower urinary tract infection was clinically manifested on day 3 postoperatively in 4 of them and in none from the control groups. bacteria spreading from the appendix to the retroperitoneal space may invade the urinary tract and cause either symptomatic or asymptomatic urinary tract infection in patients with aa.
[clinically isolated bacterii seen in complicated infections].
the spectrum of causative bacterial agents responsible for post-operative infections in the surgical field have dramatically changed with time. this could be due to recent technical progress in bacterial extraction or the result of more effective antibiotics used post-operatively. nevertheless nosocomial infections including those caused by mrsa still demand our close attention. commonly extracted bacterii include staphylococcus spp., e. faecalis, e. coli, klebsiella spp., e. cloacae, p. aeruginosa and bacteroides spp., but with regards to pathogenicity, extraction frequency and drug resistance, agents requiring the highest note of caution may be mrsa, p. aeruginosa and bacteroides spp. mrsa is still the bacterium which makes the most frequent appearance in the clinical field, and the only effective antibiotic to mrsa is vancomycin. in addition, p. aeruginosa is the most common bacterial agent seen in post-operative infections and also the agent to which many of the cephem drugs do not express a high degree of antibacterial effect. furthermore, about half of the bacteroides spp. are beta-lactamase-producing strains which deactive the effect of penicillin and cephem drugs within the infection site. a drug which proves effective against e. coli may nevertheless become somewhat ineffective against this agent when found in a mixed infection and if the drug lacks stability against beta-lactamase. clinically, mixed infections including some or even all the above agents are known to occur, continuously drawing our close attention.
in vitro and in vivo activities of lb10522, a new catecholic cephalosporin.
in vitro activity of lb10522 was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefoperazone against clinical isolates. against gram-positive bacteria, lb10522 was most active among the compounds tested. it was fourfold more active than cefpirome against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis. lb10522 was highly effective against most members of the family enterobacteriaceae tested. ninety percent of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, and salmonella spp. were inhibited at a concentration of < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml. these activities were comparable to those of cefpirome. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, lb10522 with a mic at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited of 2 micrograms/ml was 16- and 32-fold more active than ceftazidime and ceftazidime against systemic infections caused by staphylococcus aureus giorgio, streptococcus pneumoniae iii, pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e, escherichia coli 851e, proteus mirabilis 1315e, serratia marcescens 1826e, and acinetobacter calcoaceticus ac-54. lb10522 was very resistant to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases such as tem-3, tem-7, shv-1, fec-1, and p-99. lb10522 did not induce beta-lactamase in enterobacter cloacae 1194e, although most of the reference cephalosporins acted as inducers of beta-lactamase in this strain. time-kill study showed that lb10522, at concentrations of two or four times the mic, had a rapid bactericidal activity against staphylococcus aureus 6538p, escherichia coli 851e, and pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e.
[comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1994). iii. secular changes in susceptibility].
susceptibilities of enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia spp. isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (utis) in 10 hospitals during june 1994 to may 1995 to various antimicrobial agents were compared with those in the same period of previous years according to a classification, uncomplicated utis, complicated utis without indwelling catheter, and complicated utis with indwelling catheter. no remarkable changes were found in susceptibilities of citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp. and serratia spp. the susceptibilities of e. faecalis to amikacin and quinolones were better than those in 1993. as for s. aureus, susceptible strains to all drugs increased in uncomplicated utis. against e. coli in 1993, the antimicrobial activities of piperacillin, cefotiam and aminoglycosides have decreased, however, in 1994, these activities have turned to the better state. as for klebsiella spp. susceptible strains to abpc decreased. the susceptibilities of p. mirabilis to all drugs except minocycline were good. against p. aeruginosa in 1993, the activities of aminoglycosides have decreased, but, in 1994, these activities have turned to the better state. these data should be considered in clinical treatment of various urinary tract infections.
[in vitro and in vivo activities of sulopenem compared with those of imipenem and cephalosporins].
the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sulopenem (cp-70,429),a new  parenteral penem antibiotic, were compared with those of imipenem (ipm), flomoxef, cefuzonam (czon) and cefotaxime. sulopenem possessed broad-spectrum activities against gram-positive bacteria and gram-negative bacteria. antibacterial activities of sulopenem against methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae were equivalent to or somewhat superior to those of ipm. against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, sulopenem was 4- to 260-fold more active than reference antibiotics with broad-spectra. in a killing kinetics study for haemophilus influenzae, sulopenem showed a 99.9% decrease of viable cells after 8 hours at a concentration of 0.20 micrograms/ml. this effect was obtained at a concentration 8-fold lower than that of ipm. the protective effects of sulopenem in murine experimental systemic infections were superior to those of imipenem/cilastatin. in murine experimental mixed infection with escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis, sulopenem had lower ed50, in other words stronger antimicrobial activities than ipm. the therapeutic effect of sulopenem are related well with its mic value. in guinea pigs experimental lung infection with klebsiella pneumoniae, sulopenem was more effective than czon or cefotiam.

structure-activity relationship of new 2-substituted penem antibiotics.
the antibacterial activities of three new penems with 4-hydroxyprolinamide, 1-prolinamide and n-methyl-n-2-propionamide substituents, respectively, in position 2 and of their stereoisomers were examined against staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. all substitutes conferred a broad antibacterial spectrum on the penem moiety. changes in stereoisomerism selectively improved the activity against e. coli, s. aureus or enterococci. the structure-activity relationships of each compound were discussed in relation to minimum inhibitory concentrations, penicillin-binding protein (pbp) affinity and outer membrane permeability coefficient in e. coli. in this microorganism, pbp 2 was the target for all compounds. changes in stereoisomerism influenced the affinity for pbps 1a/b and 2. all antibiotics easily permeated the outer membrane of e. coli and, within each group of compounds, the penetration rate correlated with the antibacterial activity.
[comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1993). i. susceptibility distribution].
the frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 657 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 10 hospitals during the period of june 1993 to may 1994. of the above total bacterial isolates, gram-positive bacteria accounted for 28.3% and a majority of them were enterococcus faecalis. gram-negative bacteria accounted for 71.7% and most of them were escherichia coli. 1. enterococcus faecalis ampicillin (abpc), imipenem (ipm) and vancomycin (vcm) showed the highest activities against e. faecalis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. the mic90s of them were 2 micrograms/ml. piperacillin (pipc) was also active with the mic90 of 8 micrograms/ml. the others were not so active with the mic90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 2. staphylococcus aureus including mrsa vcm showed the highest activities against s. aureus isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. its mic90 was 1 microgram/ml. arbekacin (abk) was also active with the mic90 of 2 micrograms/ml. the others were not so active with the mic90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 3. staphylococcus epidermidis vcm showed the strongest activity against s. epidermidis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. its mic90 was 1 microgram/ml. abk was also active with the mic90 of 4 micrograms/ml. the others except abpc were not so active with the mic90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 4. streptococcus agalactiae most of the agents were active against s. agalactiae isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. penicillins, cephems, erythromycin (em), and clindamycin (cldm) showed the highest activities. the mic90s of them were 0.25 microgram/ml or below. amikacin (amk) and minocycline (mino) showed somewhat low activities with the mic90s of 16 micrograms/ml. 5. citrobacter freundii ipm showed the highest activities against c. freundii isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. its mic90 was 2 micrograms/ml. cefozopran (czop) and gentamicin (gm) were also active with the mic90s of 8 micrograms/ml. penicillins and cephems generally were not so active. 6. enterobacter cloacae ipm and gm showed the highest activities against e. cloacae. the mic90s of them were 1 microgram/ml. czop and tosufloxacin (tflx) were also active with the mic90s of 8 micrograms/ml. penicillins and cephems except czop showed lower activities with the mic90s of 64 micrograms/ml or above. 7. escherichia coli most of antimicrobial agents were active against e. coli. flomoxef (fmox), czop, ipm, cpfx and tflx showed the highest activities against e. coli. the mic90s of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. cefmenoxime (cmx), ceftazidime (caz), cefuzonam (czon), latamoxef (lmox), carumonam (crmn), norfloxacin (nflx) and ofloxacin (oflx) were also active with the mic90s of 0.25 microgram/ml. penicillins and mino were not so active with the mic90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 8. klebsiella pneumoniae czop, ipm and crmn showed the highest activities against k. pneumoniae. the mic90s of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. caz, czon, cfix, cpfx and tflx were also active the mic90s of 0.25 microgram/ml. penicillins were not so active with the mic90s of 128 micrograms/ml or above. 9. proteus mirabilis p. mirabilis was susceptible to a majority of drugs. cmx, caz, czon, lmox, cfix, crmn and cpfx showed the highest activities against p. mirabilis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. the mic90s of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. mino was not so active with the mic90 of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 10. pseudomonas aeruginosa most of the agents were not so active against p. aeruginosa. ipm showed mic90 of 8 micrograms/ml.

toc-39, a new parenteral cephalosporin, is a hydroxyimino-type cephem antibiotic  with vinylthio-pyridyl moiety at the 3 position. toc-39 was evaluated for antibacterial activity against various clinically isolated strains. toc-39 had excellent activity, stronger than that of methicillin, oxacillin, the cephalosporins tested, imipenem, gentamicin, minocycline, tobramycin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and had an mic comparable to that of vancomycin (the mics of toc-39 and vancomycin for 90% of the strains tested were 3.13 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively). against enterococcus faecalis strains, which are resistant to cephalosporins, toc-39 was twice as active as ampicillin. against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp., and streptococcus pneumoniae, toc-39 was twice as active as or more active than cefotiam, ceftazidime, flomoxef, and cefpirome. against streptococcus pyogenes, toc-39 was superior to cefotiam, ceftazidime, and flomoxef and was similar to cefpirome. in addition, the activity of toc-39 was equal to or greater than that of cefotiam, ceftazidime, flomoxef, and cefpirome against haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and morganella morganii. in terms of bactericidal effect against mrsa, toc-39 was superior to vancomycin. no mutant resistant to toc-39 or vancomycin was obtained from susceptible mrsa strains. in murine systemic infection models, toc-39 showed potent activity against s. aureus and e. coli. against highly mrsa, the activity of toc-39 was comparable to that of vancomycin.
[effect of biapenem (l-627) on fecal flora in gnotobiotic mice and children].
biapenem (l-627), a novel injectable carbapenem antibiotic, was studied with regard to its effect on mice inoculated with four types of bacteria and on the intestinal flora of pediatric patients. l-627 was given i.m., 40 mg/kg once daily for 5 consecutive days, to mice inoculated enterically with four types of bacteria (escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis, and bifidobacterium breve). except for a mild decrease in e. coli, there were no major fluctuations in viable bacterial counts in the feces during the treatment. five children with bacterial infections (3 boys and 2 girls; ages: 1 month to 7 years and 7 months; body weights 4.62-21.8 kg) were given l-627 at 6.0 to 11.7 mg/kg 3 times daily for 7 to 11 days. among aerobes, although enterobacteriaceae such as e. coli tended to decrease remarkably in all patients, there was no major change in enterococcus. consequently, total aerobe counts did not change significantly in any patient. among anaerobes, bifidobacterium, bacteroides, and eubacterium, which are the predominant organisms in infants, decreased remarkably in some patients. one of the patients showed a marked decrease in total anaerobe count associated with a change in fecal characteristics (diarrhea). glucose nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli or fungi did not become predominant organisms in any patient. recovery from these changes in the intestinal flora was noted promptly after terminating l-627 treatment. l-627 was detected in the feces of 4 patients during treatment. the fecal concentration ranged from 0.24 to 2.22 micrograms/g. clostridium difficile was not detected in any patient. although c. difficile d-1 antigen was observed in 2 patients, it bore no relationship to fecal properties. the results indicated that l-627 had relatively few effects on the intestinal flora compared to other new beta-lactam antibiotics.
survival, physiological response and recovery of enteric bacteria exposed to a polar marine environment.
survival, sublethal injury, and recoverability of escherichia coli, enterococcus  faecalis, salmonella typhimurium, and yersinia enterocolitica were investigated by using diffusion chambers over 54 to 56 days of in situ exposure to a polar marine environment (-1.8 degrees c; salinity, 34.5 ppt) at mcmurdo station, antarctica. plate counts were used to assess recoverability and injury, whereas direct viable counts (dvcs) and 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride (ctc) reduction were utilized to determine substrate responsiveness and respiratory activity, respectively. t90 values (times for 10-fold decreases in numbers of recoverable cells) on nonselective medium were ca. 216 to 259 h for e. coli, s. typhimurium, and y. enterocolitica and 432 h for e. faecalis. sublethal injury was greater in populations of indicator bacteria than in pathogens. dvcs, ctc reduction, and plate counts indicated progressive increases in viable but nonculturable cells in e. coli, s. typhimurium, and y. enterocolitica cultures throughout the 54-day exposure. forty-eight-day exposure of e. coli, s. typhimurium, and y. enterocolitica resulted in decreased optimal incubation temperatures for colony formation and inability to form colonies at 37 degrees c. the detection of responsive e. coli, s. typhimurium, and y. enterocolitica by the dvc and ctc methods remained within 1% of inoculum values during 54 days of exposure, indicating some long-term persistence in the viable-but-nonculturable state. percentages of respiring e. coli and s. typhimurium increased significantly upon addition of nutrients at all temperatures tested, indicating that nutrient availability rather than temperature limited enteric bacterial activity in this very cold environment. large nutrient inputs to low-temperature marine environments may thus allow for the long-term persistence of enteric bacteria in a nonrecoverable state.
in vitro activity of cp-99,219, a novel 7-(3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexyl) naphthyridone antimicrobial.
the in vitro activity of cp-99,219 was compared with that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 814 clinical bacterial isolates using a microdilution method with brain-heart infusion broth. cp-99,219 was the most potent agent tested against methicillin-resistant, ciprofloxacin-susceptible staphylocci (minimum inhibitory concentration [mic]90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). cp-99,219 was 32-fold and fourfold more potent than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, respectively, against streptococcus pneumoniae, including strains resistant to penicillin g and erythromycin (mic90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). cp-99,219 was also the most potent agent tested against s. pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis (mic90 < or = 0.5 microgram/ml). the activity of cp-99,219 against enterobacteriaceae was comparable to that of sparfloxacin, with 90% of escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, c. diversus, helicobacter pylori, and k. oxytoca being inhibited by < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were less susceptible, with mic90 values to cp-99,219 of 4, 2, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 for bacteroides fragilis was 0.39 microgram/ml for cp-99,219 compared with 12.5 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. cp-99,219 was highly bactericidal at 1 x to 4 x mic against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms; its activity was similar in nutrient, trypticase soy, and cation-supplemented mueller-hinton broths. the spectrum and potency observed with cp-99,219 warrant further testing with this novel quinolone.
in vitro antibacterial activity of fk037, a new parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin, against recent clinical isolates in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
the antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, fk037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between january 1992 and june 1993. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), bacteroides fragilis and prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for enterococcus faecalis. fk037 was superior in potency to ceftazidime against all strains except e. faecalis, p. anaerobius and p. bivia. it was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and p. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. fk037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against mrsa, s. agalactiae and e. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except g. vaginalis and b. fragilis that were 4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to fk037.
minimum inhibitory concentration quality-control guidelines for biapenem, du-6859a, fk-037, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, and ceftizoxime when using various national committee for clinical laboratory standards susceptibility test methods. quality control study group.
several multilaboratory collaborative studies using broth microdilution and agar  dilution (gonococcal tests only) methods of susceptibility testing were performed to establish quality-control (qc) giudelines. replicate dilution tests with multiple lots of media were performed with national committee for clinical laboratory standards recommended qc strains (escherichia coli atcc 25922, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, and staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213) by using the following antimicrobials: biapenem, du-6859a, fk-037, levofloxacin, and grepafloxacin. in addition qc mic ranges, using appropriate medium modification for haemophilus influenzae atcc 49247 and neisseria gonorrhoeae atcc 49226 were reported on four (du-6859a, fk-037, levofloxacin, and grepafloxacin) and two (ceftizoxime and fk-037) antimicrobials, respectively.
molecular requirements for the inhibition of the tetracycline antiport protein and the effect of potent inhibitors on the growth of tetracycline-resistant bacteria.
forty-seven compounds and tetracycline (tc) structural analogues were tested for  their ability to interfere with [3h]tc uptake in everted inner membrane vesicles derived from tc-resistant escherichia coli d1-209, bearing the class b tetracycline resistance efflux protein (tet protein). for effective inhibition of tc uptake, the molecule had to have an intact abcd tetracyclic carbon skeleton and a conjugated phenolic beta-diketone substructure at positions 10-12a with the subsequent development of keto-enol tautomerization. molecular variations at carbon positions 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 did not decrease, and some increased, the inhibitory activity as compared to that of tc. among these compounds, the highest inhibition of uptake occurred with certain position 6 and 13 derivatives of 5-hydroxytetracycline. in a group of 13-(propylthio) derivatives of 5-oh-tc [13-propyl, 13-(3-chloropropyl), and 13-(2-carboxyethyl)] there was a correlation between uptake inhibitory activity and antibacterial activity. the 13-(3-chloropropyl) derivative, with the best efflux inhibitory activity, exhibited synergistic activity when tested in combination with doxycycline against tc-resistant e. coli bearing the class a or b determinant, against staphylococcus aureus bearing class k, and against enterococcus faecalis bearing the class l determinant. the 13-propyl analogue also showed high transport blocking activity and showed synergistic antibacterial activity against e. coli bearing the class a determinant and additive activity against the other tc-resistant bacteria. the synergistic antibacterial activity of these compounds was not shown by the 13-[(2-carboxyethyl)thio] homologue, whose efflux blocking activity was 70-fold less. these findings suggest that multiple sites on the tc molecule are available for synthetic modification toward the development of an effective tc blocking agent. such compounds, used alone or in combination with a standard tetracycline, show improved antibacterial activity.
bactericidal properties of crude extracts of mitracarpus villosus.
mature leaves and inflorescence of mitracarpus villosus, collected from niger state, nigeria, were shade dried over a period of 5 days, ground into fine particles in a waring blender and extracted individually with hot distilled water and 95% ethanol. the crude extracts obtained were tested for their in vitro antibacterial activities using agar diffusion and tube dilution techniques. the extracts produced zones of inhibition (8-23 mm) against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis and streptococcus faecalis, while pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis were not inhibited. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of the effective extracts were in the range 0.06-8.0 mg/ml, while the minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc) were in the range 0.06-32.0 mg/ml. the ethanolic extracts appeared to exert more inhibitory action against the bacteria than the hot water extracts.
differences in sensitivity to nadh of purified pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes of enterococcus faecalis, lactococcus lactis, azotobacter vinelandii and escherichia coli: implications for their activity in vivo.
the effect of nadh on the activity of the purified pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes (pdhc) of enterococcus (ec.) faecalis, lactococcus lactis, azotobacter vinelandii and escherichia coli was determined in vitro. it was found that the pdhc of e. coli and l. lactis was active only at relatively low nadh/nad ratios, whereas the pdhc of ec. faecalis was inhibited only at high nadh/nad ratios. the pdhc of azotobacter vinelandii showed an intermediate sensitivity. the organisms were grown in chemostat culture under conditions that led to different intracellular nadh/nad ratios and the pdhc activities in vivo could be calculated from the specific rates of product formation. under anaerobic growth conditions, only ec. faecalis expressed pdhc activity in vivo. the activities in vivo of the complexes of the different organisms were in good agreement with their properties determined in vitro. the physiological consequences of these results are discussed.
deamidation of hpr, a phosphocarrier protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system, involves asparagine 38 (hpr-1) and asparagine 12 (hpr-2) in isoaspartyl acid formation.
histidine-containing protein, hpr, of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system in escherichia coli, when incubated at elevated temperatures forms many species of protein. the two major species are hpr-1 and hpr-2, which have been shown to lack one or two amides, respectively (anderson, b., weigel, n., kundig, w., and roseman, s. (1971) j. biol. chem. 246, 7023-7033). the formation of hpr-1 and hpr-2 is shown to be ph-dependent and does not occur readily below ph 6. investigation of the identities and properties of the two residues that deamidate involved creation of site-directed mutants at the 6 glutamine and 2 asparagine residues of hpr; description of their deamidation species by isoelectric focusing; determination of their relative antibody binding properties; assay of their phosphoacceptor and phosphodonor activities; characterization of tryptic and v8-protease peptides; obtaining two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of hpr, hpr-1, and several mutants. it was determined that the sequential deamidation of asn-38 and asn-12 yields hpr-1 and hpr-2. both residues exist as asn-gly pairs, and both deamidations probably form isoaspartyl acid. hpr from bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus carnosus which also have asn-gly at residues 38 and 39 form hpr-1 species presumably by deamidation. hpr from streptococcus faecalis which does not have asn-38 does not form a hpr-1 species. the e. coli mutant hprs, n12d and q51e, residues that may be involved in the active site, had impaired phosphohydrolysis properties and decreased phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system activity.
[evaluation of in vitro antimicrobial activity of cefazolin alone and in combination with cefmetazole or flomoxef using agar dilution method and disk diffusion method].
antimicrobial activities of cefazolin (cez) against 251 strains of various clinical isolates obtained during 1989 and 1990 were determined using the mueller-hinton agar dilution method at an inoculum level 10(6) cfu/ml. the reliability of the disk susceptility test was also studied using mueller-hinton agar and various disks at inoculum levels of 10(3-4) cfu/cm2 in estimating approximate values of mics. in addition, antimicrobial activities of cez and cefmetazole (cmz) or flomoxef (fmox) in combination were investigated against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant staphylococcus aureus (mssa and mrsa) using the checkerboard agar dilution mic method and the disk diffusion test either with the disks contained cez, cmz, and fmox alone, or cez, and cmz or fmox in combination. in this study, the mics of cez against s. aureus were distributed with the 3 peak values at 0.39 microgram/ml, 3.13 micrograms/ml and > 100 micrograms/ml. mics against mssa were 0.39 microgram/ml to 0.78 microgram/ml, whereas those against mrsa were greater than 0.78 microgram/ml. mics against majority of strains of enterococcus faecalis were 25 micrograms/ml. over 90% of strains of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were inhibited at the level of 3.13 micrograms/ml. about 60% of isolates of indole negative proteus spp. were inhibited at the levels of less than 3.13 micrograms/ml and 100% at 6.25 micrograms/ml, but mics against indole positive proteus spp., serratia spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa were over 100 micrograms/ml. the antimicrobial activities of cez against these clinical isolates were not significantly different compared to those reported about 15-20 years ago, except for s. aureus. highly resistant strains of s. aureus to cez were more prevalent in this study. the inhibitory zones obtained with the disk test were compared with mics. the results of cez disk susceptibility test with 30 micrograms disk (showa) or 10 micrograms disk (prepared in this laboratory) were well correlated with mics (r = -0.837 and -0.814, respectively), showing the reliavility of the disk method in estimating approximate values of mics. in the 4 category classification system currently used in japan, break points in mic values proposed are () mic < or = 3 micrograms/ml, (++) > 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) > 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) > 60 micrograms/ml. the results obtained with 30 micrograms disks showed false positive in 7.7% and false negative in 6.8% of the samples. the disk results with e. faecalis showed a higher ratio of false positive results.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
in vitro activity of mc-352, a new 16-membered macrolide.
the in vitro activity of mc-352, 3,4'-dideoxy-5-o-mycaminosyltylonolide, was compared with those of erythromycin, clarithromycin, and rokitamycin. the mc-352 mic90 (mic for 90% of isolates) for erythromycin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis was less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, similar to those of the other agents. the mc-352 mic50 for erythromycin-resistant s. aureus was 2 micrograms/ml, similar to that of rokitamycin. the mc-352 mic90 (0.12 micrograms/ml) for streptococcus pyogenes was similar to those of erythromycin and clarithromycin and superior to that of rokitamycin, and the mc-352 mic90 for group b, c, and g streptococci was 0.25 microgram/ml. mc-352 and clarithromycin had an mic90 of 0.12 microgram/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae. erythromycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis was inhibited by mc-352 at 1 microgram/ml, but the mic for constitutively erythromycin-resistant isolates was greater than 16 micrograms/ml. legionella pneumophila was inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. mc-352 was the most active agent against bacteroides fragilis, with an mic90 of 8 micrograms/ml, and was more active than the other agents against haemophilus influenzae, with an mic90 of 4 micrograms/ml. moraxella spp. were inhibited by mc-352 at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. the mic90 for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and salmonella, shigella, yersinia, enterobacter, citrobacter, and serratia spp. was greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. mc-352 was bactericidal for s. pyogenes and s. pneumoniae, and its activity was not altered by human serum.
antibacterial activity of a 1,8-naphthyridine quinolone, pd 131628.
a new 1,8-naphthyridine quinolone antimicrobial, pd131628, was found to be as, or more active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against escherichia coli and considerably more active than the two 4-quinolone agents against staphylococci in terms of both mic and obc (the optimum bactericidal concentration, at which the rate of kill is greatest). in common with ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, the rate of kill of pd131628 against enterococcus faecalis was considerably slower than against the other three species tested. bacterial protein synthesis, rna synthesis and cell division were not required for the bactericidal activity of pd131628 against e. coli or the staphylococci, although the lethality of pd131628 in the absence of these activities was reduced.
[susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents, 1989. a study mainly focused on imipenem. the research group for testing imipenem susceptibilities of clinical isolates].
we investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (ipm) and other antimicrobial agents at hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1989. the susceptibility testing was carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: (+++), (++), (+) and (-). ipm showed markedly high in vitro activities against streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, bacteroides fragilis and had rather strong activities against enterococcus faecalis, haemophilus influenzae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and achromobacter xylosoxidans, but was less active to staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and xanthomonas maltophilia. ipm has been found to have activities superior to those of other antibiotics tested against e. faecalis, e. cloacae, c. freundii, s. marcescens, p. aeruginosa and b. fragilis. no antibiotics tested showed good activities against mrsa except minocycline.
interaction of imipenem with erythromycin and tetracycline assessed by microdilution checkerboard techniques.
microdilution methodology was used to study the interaction of imipenem with erythromycin and tetracycline, a combination therapy that might be used for the treatment of serious pelvic inflammatory disease. the combination of imipenem and erythromycin showed no antagonism for escherichia coli and haemophilus influenzae but was antagonistic for staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and group b streptococci; the combination of imipenem and tetracycline was antagonistic for all strains except h. influenzae. correlation between the results of kill curves and the measurement of fractional bactericidal concentration (fbc) indices was good, although fbc indices showed less antagonism than kill curves. fractional inhibitory concentration indices showed poor correlation, rarely showing antagonism, and indeed showed synergy in three cases. if erythromycin or tetracycline is considered necessary in addition to imipenem in the treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease, it is probably more effective when given after the course of imipenem has been completed.
cloning, sequencing, and expression in escherichia coli of a streptococcus faecalis autolysin.
a streptococcus faecalis genomic bank was obtained by partial digestion with mboi and cloning into the sali restriction site of ptz18r. screening of about 60,000 escherichia coli transformants for cell wall lysis activity was done by exposing recombinant colonies grown on medium containing lyophilized micrococcus lysodeikticus cells to chloroform and toluene vapors in order to release proteins. because this procedure provoked cell death, colonies could not be used directly for transformant recovery; however, recovery was achieved by partial purification of plasmid dna from active colonies on the agar plate and transformation of e. coli competent cells. about 60 recombinants were found. one of them (psh6500) codes for a lytic enzyme active against s. faecalis and m. lysodeikticus cell walls. a shorter clone (psh4000) was obtained by deleting an ecori fragment from the 6.5-kb original insert, leaving a 4-kb ecori-mboi insert; this subclone expressed the same lytic activity. sequencing of a portion of psh4000 revealed a unique open reading frame of 2,013 nucleotides coding for a 641-amino-acid (74-kda) polypeptide and containing four 204-nucleotide direct repeats.
selected faecal bacteria and nutrients essential for antagonism of salmonella typhimurium in anaerobic continuous flow cultures.
as few as five of the species of bacteria commonly found in human faeces--escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides ovatus and fusobacterium varium--when grown together in anaerobic continuous flow cultures exerted antagonistic effects on salmonella typhimurium as great as those given by mixed bacteria from extracts of human faeces. in a single culture, the population of s. typhimurium was c. 10(8) cfu/ml but in mixed cultures with the five antagonistic bacteria or mixed faecal bacteria it was reduced to c. 10(3) cfu/ml. antagonism appeared to be the result of competition for the growth limiting amino acids, arginine, serine, threonine and aspartic acid. optimal manifestation of antagonism required the presence of carbon sources fermentable only by antagonistic bacteria, such as lactose 0.1%, w/v, sucrose 0.1% (w/v) and starch 0.2-0.3% w/v. these carbohydrates promoted the growth of the antagonistic bacteria, particularly e. coli and b. ovatus. however, an increase in concentration by several fold of any one of four growth-limiting amino acids in the medium diminished the antagonistic effects and the population of s. typhimurium rose 10(2)-10(3)-fold.
[antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against fresh clinical isolates from superficial suppurative foci].
the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 5 drugs (ciprofloxacin (cpfx), and 4 drugs used as standard) were determined to investigate antibacterial potencies of cpfx against bacterial strains isolated in 1989 from superficial suppurative foci. the clinical isolates tested included 375 strains from 11 aerobic bacterial species, and 50 strains from 2 anerobic bacterial genera (group) for a total of 425 isolates. interpreting mic level distributions of these drugs as the expression of antibacterial potencies, the results are as follows. 1. when activities of new-quinolone antibiotics were tested, we found that, cpfx expressed far superior antibacterial potency to ofloxacin (oflx) and norfloxacin (nflx) against coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and peptostreptococcus spp., although the activity of cpfx against bacteroides fragilis group was weaker than that of oflx, and cpfx had similar activity against staphylococcus aureus to oflx. 2. in comparison to beta-lactam antibiotics, cpfx was inferior to amoxicillin (ampc) against e. faecalis and inferior to ampc and cefaclor (ccl) against peptostreptococcus spp. against all other bacterial species, however, cpfx expressed superior antibacterial potency to ampc and ccl. 3. scattered findings of low sensitivity or resistance to cpfx were observed among the s. aureus, e. faecalis, e. faecium, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, p. aeruginosa and b. fragilis (group) species, but with an exception of e. faecium, the incidence of resistance strains was low.
effect of hydrogen peroxide on growth of candida, cryptococcus, and other yeasts  in simulated blood culture bottles.
the addition of hydrogen peroxide to blood contained in liquid culture medium increased the dissolved-o2 partial pressure in direct proportion to the volume injected. the effect of hydrogen peroxide on the growth of subcultured clinical isolates of candida albicans, cryptococcus neoformans, torulopsis glabrata, and other yeasts and on the growth of blood culture isolates of representative pathogenic bacteria was compared with its effect on their growth in vented and unvented stationary bottles. c. albicans and c. neoformans grew significantly better in bottles to which hydrogen peroxide had been added than in vented or unvented bottles. the advantage of hydrogen peroxide over venting was most marked with several slowly growing strains. similar results were obtained in shaker cultures with strains of c. albicans which were inoculated directly from positive blood cultures. the effect of hydrogen peroxide tended to diminish during serial passage. t. glabrata grew less well when hydrogen peroxide was added, perhaps because of the absence of oxidase. the growth of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterococcus faecalis was not significantly inhibited or augmented by the addition of hydrogen peroxide. the growth of escherichia coli was inhibited slightly. the value of the addition of hydrogen peroxide to blood cultures to improve the isolation of yeasts needs to be established by a clinical trial which would compare this method with established methods.
[susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. a study mainly focused on imipenem. reported by the research group for testing imipenem susceptibility on clinical isolates].
this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (ipm) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1988. in this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by nccls in which susceptibilities are classified into "s", "ms", "i" and "r". ipm showed markedly high in vitro activities against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, salmonella spp., citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, alcaligenes spp., peptococcus spp./peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides spp. ipm also had strong activities against achromobacter xylosoxidans and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against flavobacterium spp., e. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas cepacia. in a study in which activities of ipm against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among s. aureus, cns, a. calcoaceticus and p. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, h. influenzae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, c. freundii, s. marcescens or p. mirabilis.

we investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (ipm) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1988. in this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. ipm had significantly high activity against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, salmonella spp., citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, providencia rettgeri, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, moraxella catarrhalis, alcaligenes spp., peptococcus spp./peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), enterococcus faecalis, haemophilus influenzae, serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, providencia stuartii and pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. in a comparative study on activities of ipm against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, h. influenzae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, c. freundii, p. mirabilis or a. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among staphylococcus aureus, cns, s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa.
antimicrobial actions of calcium binding leucocyte l1 protein, calprotectin.
the calcium binding l1 protein was found to inhibit growth of blood culture isolates of candida spp and cerebrospinal fluid isolates of cryptococcus neoformans. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) were 4-128 mg/l, and concentrations 2-4 times the mic were fungicidal. blood culture isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis had mic values of 64-256 mg/l. antibacterial activity was strongly influenced by the nature of the culture medium. in view of the biological activity of l1, the name calprotectin is proposed to describe this antimicrobial protein with calcium binding properties.
disinfection by endodontic irrigants and dressings of experimentally infected dentinal tubules.
the effect of endodontic irrigants and dressings was tested on bacteria in bovine dentin specimens experimentally infected with enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, escherichia coli, or pseudomonas aeruginosa. standardized, cylindrical dentin test pieces were prepared and cleaned by ultrasonic treatment with edta and sodium hypochlorite. the specimens were infected with the test organism for periods up to 14 days, and the degree of infection into the tubules was monitored using brown & brenn stain, scanning electron microscopy, and culturing of dentin dust from sequential bur samples starting from the pulpal side. e. faecalis rapidly infected the whole length of the tubules; s. sanguis required up to 2 weeks for complete infection; e. coli only penetrated to some 600 microns, even after prolonged incubation periods. p. aeruginosa infected dentin quickly, but apparently in very low numbers. e. faecalis persisted for at least 10 d after withdrawal of nutrient support, whereas the other 3 organisms died within 4 to 48 h. endodontic medicaments were applied to infected specimen for comparison of antibacterial potency. camphorated p-monochlorophenol was generally more efficient than calasept, and of the irrigants tested, iodine potassium iodide appeared more potent than sodium hypochlorite or chlorhexidine. the presence of a smear layer delayed, but did not eliminate, the effect of the medicaments.
[comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1987). ii. background of patients].
in the retrospective survey of the sensitivity of clinical isolates reported in this journal, patients' backgrounds were also investigated. some findings are summarized below. 1. age distribution by sex: patients with ages 50 years and older accounted for a majority, irrespective of their sexes amounting 67.6% for both sexes combined. 2. annual distribution of sexes by age group: females accounted for a majority in younger age brackets, but the proportion of males increased with age, accounting for a majority in patients 70 years or older. this pattern has been repeated practically every year. 3. distribution of infection types by sex: complicated urinary tract infections were predominant in males, while simple urinary tract infections were more frequent in females. 4. annual distribution of sexes by type of infection: complicated and simple urinary tract infections combined accounted for approximately 70% in both males and females. this pattern has been repeated practically every year. 5. distribution of infection types by age: patients of advanced ages were predominant as a whole but this trend was particularly pronounced in complicated urinary tract infection cases. 6. annual distribution of infection types by age: the frequency of simple urinary tract infections among patients older than 20 years of age declined with age and this pattern has been repeated practically every year. among patients older than 20 years of age, annual frequencies of complicated urinary tract infections have been on the decrease. 7. distribution of isolated bacteria by sex: escherichia coli was more frequent in females, while enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa were more frequent in males. compared with the previous year, the frequencies of coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus spp., and e. coli increased, while that of p. aeruginosa decreased. 8. distribution of isolated bacteria by age: e. coli was most frequent on the whole, followed by e. faecalis, p. aeruginosa, klebsiella spp., and coagulase-negative staphylococci, in that order. by age group, e. coli was frequent in younger patients and the frequencies of e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa increased with age. 9. annual distribution of isolated bacteria by infection type: coagulase-negative staphylococci increased as a whole and p. aeruginosa and serratia marcescens decreased compared to 1986, but e. coli continued to be the most frequent. e. coli was isolated from a majority of simple urinary tract infection cases. the frequencies of e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa were high in cases of complicated urinary tract infections.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
therapeutic effects of cefpirome (hr 810) on experimental mixed infections with enterococcus faecalis and escherichia coli in mice.
the therapeutic effects of cefpirome (hr 810), a new cephalosporin, on mixed infections induced in mice with enterococcus faecalis hl1147 and escherichia coli hl34 were compared with those of ampicillin (amp), cefuzonam (czon), and ceftazidime (caz). cefpirome was more effective in protecting mice with systemic mixed infection (median effective dose, 52 mg/kg) than the other antibiotics (all more than 320 mg/kg). with increasing doses of cefpirome, the percentages of the animals having e. faecalis and e. coli bacteremia were decreased. czon and caz reduced only e. coli, and amp failed to reduce both strains. in the mice with urinary tract mixed infection, cefpirome and czon (40 mg/kg x 5, s.c.) significantly decreased the cfu/g kidney (p less than 0.01 vs. nontreated control), while amp and caz were active only against e. faecalis (p less than 0.05) and e. coli (p less than 0.01), respectively.
efficacy of sulbactam in an in vitro model of mixed aerobic/anaerobic infections.
bacterial interactions in mixed infections may interfere with antimicrobial therapy. the in-vitro efficacy of ampicillin alone, combination sulbactam/ampicillin, and metronidazole was studied. strains of bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecalis, alone and in association, were tested by means of a broth dilution method. minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbc) of ampicillin for b. fragilis 74 in association with e. coli 68 were up to 16-fold higher than for b. fragilis 74 alone (256 compared to 16 mg/l), but only 2-fold higher for sulbactam (5 mg/l)/ampicillin (0.5 and 0.25 g/l). association of b. fragilis 45 and e. faecalis 186 increased ampicillin mbc of e. faecalis 186 from 2 to 16 mg/l, but the combination sulbactam/ampicillin restored activity of ampicillin. in association with e. faecalis, metronidazole mbcs of b. fragilis increased up to 64-fold. strains of e. faecalis and e. coli were able to destroy 10 mg/l metronidazole within 8 to 20 h. the present experiments demonstrated effectiveness of sulbactam/ampicillin to inhibit beta-lactamases of associated pathogens. destruction of metronidazole by e. faecalis lends additional support to the use of the combination in aerobic/anaerobic infections including e. faecalis.
inhibitory activity of papain on facultative pathogens--short communication.
papain, a proteolytic enzyme obtained from papaya was found inhibitory on few facultative pathogens. while escherichia coli, staphylococcus albus, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae were inhibited at concentration from 200 ppm on the cell density of staphylococcus faecalis decreased only at higher concentration of papain (400-800 ppm).
[clinical laboratory approach to estimating the effective administration dose of  imipenem/cilastatin. evaluation of the disk susceptibility test and its interpretation system].
in vitro activities of imipenem/cilastatin (ipm/cs) against 413 clinical isolates were studied through the evaluation of mics and the results of disk susceptibility tests. the mics were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. the mic80s of imipenem (ipm) against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis were 25 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively, showing a bimodal mic distribution. however, the distribution of mics against other bacteria studied was of monomodal pattern. group a streptococcus, enterococcus faecalis were inhibited by ipm at dose levels less than 0.025 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. ipm inhibited escherichia coli at 0.20 microgram/ml, klebsiella pneumoniae at 0.39 microgram/ml, pseudomonas aeruginosa at 3.13 micrograms/ml except one strain showed a mic of 25 micrograms/ml, serratia spp. at 3.13 micrograms/ml except one with mic greater than 100 micrograms/ml, citrobacter freundii at 0.78 microgram/ml and enterobacter spp. at 0.39 microgram/ml. indole (-) proteus and indole (+) proteus were inhibited by this drug at levels of 3.13 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. the reliability of the ipm disk diffusion susceptibility test in quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was well demonstrated using commercialized 8 mm diameter showa disks containing 30 micrograms antibiotic and also disks containing 1-30 micrograms prepared in this laboratory. for the interpretation of the showa disk susceptibility test, a 4 category system was used. in the 4 category system for showa ipm disk the following classification of inhibitory zone diameters has been proposed; ( ) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml. the results of the test using showa 30 micrograms disk against various clinical isolates were accurately classified into the 4 groups, showing false positive 8 out of 304 strains (2.6%) and false negative 1 of 304 strains (0.3%). with showa 30 micrograms disks subclassification of strains with mic less than 3 micrograms/ml cannot be achieved. in this study, however, the differentiation of strains with mics less than 1 microgram/ml was made with disks containing 5-10 micrograms, which afforded to set mic break points at 1 and 3 micrograms/ml. according to current concepts on pharmacokinetics for antibiotics including the penetration of drugs into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding of drugs appears to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body. only free, unbound drug molecules can readily pass through capillary pores into tissue fluids except in the hepato-biliary system.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
[comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1986). i. susceptibility distribution].
susceptibilities to various antibacterial and antibiotic agents of bacterial strains isolated from urinary tract infections at 8 hospitals in japan from july to october in 1986 are summarized as follows. 1. enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (st) and imipenem (ipm) with mic90s of 0.78 and 1.56 microgram/ml. minocycline had the strongest activity against staphylococcus aureus; the mics for all strains tested were lower than 0.39 microgram/ml. the mic80s of dicloxacillin, and arbekacin (hbk) were 0.20 and 0.78 microgram/ml, respectively. among the cephems, the mic80 of flomoxef was 25 micrograms/ml, whereas those of cefmenoxime (cmx) and cefotiam (ctm) were 50 micrograms/ml. 2. escherichia coli was most susceptible to ofloxacin (oflx) among the oral antibacterial and antibiotic agents tested. oflx showed the minimum inhibitory concentration against 90% (mic90) of the 274 strains of e. coli tested to be lower than 0.10 microgram/ml. the antibacterial activities of the third generation cephems such as cmx and latamoxef (lmox) were the strongest among the injectable antibiotics tested. the mic90s of cmx and lmox were lower than 0.10 and 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively. ctm and cefmetazole, the second generation cephems, were also highly active against e. coli with mic90s of 0.39 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. 3. among the oral antibacterial and antibiotic agents tested, oflx was the most active against klebsiella pneumoniae. its mic90 was 0.78 microgram/ml. among the injectable antibiotics tested, cmx was the strongest with an mic90 of 0.20 microgram/ml; mic90 of ctm and lmox were 0.39 microgram/ml. 4. the tested antibacterial and antibiotic agents were generally less active against citrobacter freundii than against other bacteria. the mic80 of oflx was 0.39 microgram/ml. gentamicin (gm) and st were slightly active against c. freundii. among the cephems, cmx had the mic80 of 25 micrograms/ml. 5. enterobacter cloacae was less susceptible to the cephems tested. oflx, gm, and mecillinam were active against this bacteria with mic80s of 0.78, 0.78 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. 6. among the oral antibacterial and antibiotic agents and penicillins examined, piperacillin (pipc) was the most active against proteus mirabilis. its mic90 was 0.39 microgram/ml. those of sulbenicillin, cefaclor, ampicillin, oflx, and st were 0.78, 0.78, 1.56, 3.13 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. cmx was highly active against p. mirabilis with an mic90 of less than or equal to 0.10 microgram/ml; lmox followed with an mic90 of 0.20 microgram/ml among the injectable antibiotics tested. ctm was also active against this bacterium; the mic90 was 0.39 microgram/ml. 7. the antibacterial and antibiotic agents were generally only slightly active against proteus vulgaris.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of fk482, a new oral cephalosporin.
fk482 is an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin with a c-3 vinyl group. its activity was compared with those of cephalexin, cefuroxime, cefixime, and amoxicillin-clavulanate. fk482 inhibited 90% of staphylococcus aureus isolates at 1 micrograms/ml and 90% of streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pneumoniae isolates at less than or equal to 0.012 micrograms/ml, superior to cephalexin and cefuroxime and similar to cefixime. it did not inhibit oxacillin-resistant s. aureus. fk482 inhibited 90% of enterococcus faecalis isolates at 8 micrograms/ml. although 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, salmonella species, and shigella species isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, fk482 was less active than cefixime against citrobacter, enterobacter, morganella, serratia, and providencia species, with mics for many isolates of greater than 8 micrograms/ml. fk482 inhibited haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations comparable to that of cefixime and superior to those of cephalexin and cfaclor. bacteroides and pseudomonas species were resistant. fk482 was not hydrolyzed by the tem-1 and tem-2 beta-lactamases but was hydrolyzed by tem-3 and the proteus vulgaris enzyme. it had a high affinity for chromosomal beta-lactamases.
comparative in vitro activities of piperacillin-tazobactam and ticarcillin-clavulanate.
the in vitro activities of ticarcillin, piperacillin, clavulanic acid, tazobactam, ticarcillin-clavulanate, and piperacillin-tazobactam against 819 bacterial isolates were compared. the two beta-lactamase inhibitors, clavulanic acid and tazobactam, had little useful antibacterial activity but enhanced the activities of the penicillins against beta-lactamase-producing strains of haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus; all strains were susceptible to both combinations. both enzyme inhibitors also enhanced the activities of the penicillins against most strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., citrobacter diversus, proteus spp., providencia spp., and bacteroides spp. and against occasional strains of citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., and serratia marcescens. clavulanic acid frequently enhanced the activity of ticarcillin against xanthomonas maltophilia, and tazobactam frequently enhanced the activity of piperacillin against morganella morganii. enhancement was observed primarily with strains relatively resistant to the penicillins. in general, clavulanic acid was more effective than tazobactam in enhancing penicillin activity against klebsiella spp., c. diversus, x. maltophilia, and bacteroides spp., whereas tazobactam was more effective against escherichia coli and proteeae. there was little or no enhancement of activity against enterococcus faecalis, aeromonas hydrophila, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia, or acinetobacter anitratus. clavulanic acid occasionally antagonized the activity of ticarcillin against ticarcillin-susceptible members of the family enterobacteriaceae, but those strains were still considered susceptible to the combination. tazobactam never antagonized the activity of piperacillin. in a direct comparison of the activities of ticarcillin-clavulanate and piperacillin-tazobactam, the two were equally active against h. influenzae, b. catarrhalis, and s. aureus; the latter was more active against e. faecalis. for relatively susceptible strains of members of the family enterobacteriaceae, neither combination was predictably more active than the other, but relatively resistant strains were generally more susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam. piperacillin-tazobactam was more active than ticarcillin-clavulanate against a. hydrophila, p. aeruginosa, and p. cepacia, similar in activity against a. anitratus, and less active against x. maltophilia and bacteroides spp.
[antibacterial activity of pefloxacin in the urine during the 7 days following a  single 800 mg oral dose].
antibacterial activity of pefloxacin was studied in the urine after a single 800  mg oral dose in ten healthy female volunteers. urine was collected in 9 periods: 0-6 h, 6-12 h, 12-24 h, 24-28 h, 48-72 h, 72-96 h, 96-120 h, 120-144 h, 144-168 h. pefloxacin concentrations were assayed in all samples by a microbiological method and by hplc. urine antibacterial activity was determined towards five bacterial strains isolated in urine: 2 e. coli strains, one sensitive and the other resistant to nalidixic acid (nal-a), 1 klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to nalidixic acid (nal-b), 1 staphylococcus saprophyticus and 1 streptococcus faecalis; mic's of pefloxacin against these strains were respectively 0.015, 0.25, 1, 0.50 and 2 micrograms/ml. pefloxacin mean concentrations as determined by the microbiological method were 91.8 +/- 11.9, 71.7 +/- 7, 44.5 +/- 4.3, 24.4 +/- 4 and 5.4 +/- 0.8 micrograms/ml in the five first urine samples; low levels were present in the urine until the 7th day in 8 volunteers. hplc results completed the already known data concerning pefloxacin elimination and metabolism; unchanged pefloxacin was excreted at the highest concentration during the 6 first hours; then demethylpefloxacin was eliminated at higher levels than pefloxacin with a ratio of 2/1 after the 24th hour. these two compounds were detectable in the urine during 5 to 7 days; oxodemethylpefloxacin and n-oxyde-pefloxacin were present in lower amounts and during a shorter period.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
[antibacterial activity of cervical mucus in pregnant or non-pregnant women].
antibacterial activities of human cervical mucus obtained from non-pregnant and pregnant women were tested using standard blood agar plates. the combined effect of cervical mucus with cefmetazole (cmz) was also investigated. obtained results are summarized as follows. 1. cervical mucus specimens obtained from 6 subjects at 9 to 36 weeks of pregnancy showed antibacterial activity to only one strain of bacillus subtilis among organisms tested. the cervical mucus enhanced the activity of cmz against 1 strain of streptococcus pyogenes and 2 strains of micrococcus luteus, but no effect was observed against other organisms tested. 2. cervical mucus specimens obtained from non-pregnant women showed antibacterial activities to 8 of 11 strains (72.7%) of b. subtilis tested. the cervical mucus enhanced the activities of cmz against 1 strain of s. pyogenes and 3 strains of b. subtilis. the tested organisms included staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, s. pyogenes, b. subtilis, m. luteus, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, and candida albicans, but, as described above, cervical mucus samples showed antimicrobial activities only against b. subtilis (9/17, 52.9%), and specimens obtained only from non-pregnant women or pregnant women with less than 11 weeks of pregnancy showed any antimicrobial activities.
[bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of sulbactam/ampicillin in the pediatric field].
the usefulness of sulbactam/ampicillin (sbt/abpc) in the treatment of pediatric infections was evaluated. 1. twenty pediatric patients with infection were treated with sbt/abpc and an intravenous dosage of 27.8-47.4 mg/kg, 3 to 4 times a day. clinical efficacies in 18 patients excluding 2 patients of mycoplasma pneumonia (9 cases of pneumonia, 6 urinary tract infection, 1 tonsillitis, 1 maxillary sinusitis and 1 osteomyelitis) were judged to be excellent in 13 patients and good in 5. there was no case of failure. 2. bacteriological efficacies against 16 strains (1 staphylococcus aureus, 3 enterococcus faecalis, 4 haemophilus influenzae, 2 haemophilus parainfluenzae, 5 escherichia coli and 1 serratia sp.) isolated from 13 of the 18 patients were rated as "eradicated" for 13 strains, "decreased" for 1 and "unchanged" for 2 with an eradication rate of 81.3%. of 13 strains eradicated, 3 were those with high beta-lactamase productivity. 3. rash as a side effect developed in 1 patient and eosinophilia and elevated got and gpt were observed in 7 patients but none of them were serious. 4. blood levels of the drug following an intravenous dose of 30 mg/kg were determined in 2 pediatric patients. blood levels of sbt and abpc at 30 minutes after intravenous administration were 19.0 and 29.2 micrograms/ml in one patient and 21.0 and 31.6 micrograms/ml in another, respectively, and those at 4 hours were 0.48 and 0.62 microgram/ml in one patient and 0.59 and 0.89 microgram/ml in another, respectively. the half-lives of sbt were 0.67 and 0.70 hour and those of abpc were 0.64 and 0.69 hour in the 2 patients, respectively.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
[effect of selected bacteria on mycelial transformation of cells of candida albicans].
influence of selected bacteria representing typical physiological flora of mucous membranes of man on transformation of candida albicans from yeast phase to mycelial phase was evaluated, e. coli, s. viridans and s. faecalis inhibited to different degree mycelial transformation of fungal cells. a degree of inhibition in the case of e. coli was proportional to the period of preliminary culture of strains in medium containing serum while streptococci inhibited mycelial transformation mainly after 4 and 24 hr of preliminary culture. production of factor(s) inhibiting mycelial transformation of c. albicans by e. coli was induced by direct contact with fungal cells and by low molecular weight substances produced by c. albicans. streptococci produced inhibiting factors even when fungal cells or their metabolites were absent in the medium.
in vivo antibacterial activity of fk482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
the therapeutic activities of orally administered fk482 were compared with those  of reference antibiotics against systemic and local infections with a variety of bacteria in mice and rabbits. in systemic infections in mice, oral fk482 was almost as effective as oral cefaclor (ccl) and more effective than oral cephalexin (cex) against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis infections. however, fk482 afforded superior protective activity when given subcutaneously against e. coli infection in mice, and this activity was more potent than that of subcutaneously given ccl. in comparison with ccl, the reason that the in vivo activity of orally given fk482 against mouse systemic infections was weaker than had been anticipated from its potent in vitro activity was due to its poor oral absorption in mice. in local infections in rabbits, a species in which fk482 was better absorbed than in mice, fk482 was more effective than ccl, cex or amoxicillin (ampc). against pneumonia induced by s. aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, fk482 was as effective as ampc and more effective than ccl in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the lungs of infected rabbits. in the oral treatment of experimental ascending pyelonephritis in rabbits, fk482 was superior to ccl and ampc against methicillin-resistant s. aureus infection, as effective as ampc and more effective than ccl against enterococcus faecalis infection, and as effective as cefixime (cfix) and more effective than ccl and ampc against e. coli infection in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the kidneys and urine.
[clinical laboratory approach in estimating the effective dosage of cefamandole].
reliability of the cefamandole (cmd) disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of mics was studied using various clinical isolates totaling 246 strains with showa discs (8 mm diameter containing 30 micrograms of cmd). clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the cmd disc tests, which is normally used in japan, was also evaluated to determine whether this system would be suitable or not for the evaluation of a proper dose of administration. the results obtained with the disc method were compared with mics determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. the results of the cmd disc susceptibility test were well correlated with mics, showing the reliability of the disc method to estimate approximate values of mics. break points in mic values proposed for the classification of bacteria into 4 categories of susceptibility are () mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml. only 4 (1.6%) out the 246 strains tested showed false positive results and 11 (4.5%) showed false negative results, showing the excellent reliability of this test. in this study, approximately 90% of strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis isolated from clinical materials randomly were inhibited by cmd at concentrations less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. proteus vulgaris and enterobacter aerogenes were sensitive to cmd at 67 and 69% of strains, respectively, at concentrations below 6.25 micrograms/ml. cmd was not active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens and enterococcus faecalis. about 90% of staphylococcus aureus were inhibited at dose levels smaller than 6.25 micrograms/ml and 70% of the strains at levels less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. susceptibilities to 15 micrograms/ml cmd of highly methicillin-resistant strains (mic greater than 30 micrograms/ml) of s. aureus were examined. ten of 12 strains examined were found susceptible to cmd, but only 6 of the 12 to cefmetazole. imipenem/cilastatin was effective to 5 of the 12 strains at levels lower than 3 micrograms/ml and to one at a level less than 15 micrograms/ml. minocycline was effective against 11 strains at concentrations below 2 micrograms/ml.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
[use of ceftriaxone against parametritis after radical surgery for cancer of the  uterine cervix].
1. the bacteria isolated from pelvic dead space drainage well reflect the characteristics of prophylactic drugs. as drugs advance from penicillin (pc) to tetracycline (tc) to the first, second and third generation cephems, detection rates for gram-negative bacilli, mainly escherichia coli, decrease remarkably, while those for gram-positive cocci, mainly enterococcus faecalis, increase. 2. the bacteria isolated from the drainage and those which later caused parametritis and purulent lymphocyst were closely related. it is therefore very important to identify bacteria present in the drainage. 3. judging from changes occurred in blood levels of ceftriaxone (ctrx) and its effective transfer to the pelvic dead space when ctrx 2 g was administered once daily, this administration regimen is considered to control even parametritis and purulent lymphocyst satisfactorily. 4. ctrx 2 g was administered once daily for 5 consecutive days to each of 4 patients with parametritis, and it was observed that the general efficacy was good in 3 of the 4 cases.
[comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1985). ii. background of patients].
we have investigated relationships between patients' backgrounds and isolates from urinary tract infections in reference to various conditions, such as sexes, age distribution by sex, species of causative organisms by sex, age distribution according to species and types of infections, species and infections before and after treatment with antibacterial agents, and species and detected places. as for the relationship between sexes and types of infections, although simple urinary tract infections were consistently found at about 20% in men and at about 80% in women between 1981 and 1983, these infections were seen at 24.4% in men and at 75.6% in women in 1984, and at 26.6% and at 73.4% in 1985, indicating slight decreases in the ratio of women. by contrast, complex urinary tract infections were found in men at about 60-70% from 1981 up to 1985, regardless of the presence or absence of indwelling catheter. there were no noticeable changes according to age during this 5-year period in incidences of infections including simple urinary tract infection and complex urinary tract infection with or without indwelling catheter. thus, backgrounds of patients with urinary tract infections, including sex, age and simple or complex infections, were fairly consistent throughout this period, while there were relatively large changes in species of isolates. enterococcus faecalis was isolated at about 8% of both men and women in 1982 and 1983, but its isolation rates were increased to 22.5% of men and 17.9% of women in 1984. in 1985 this species was isolated in 14.9% of men and 7.6% of women, and in 11.2% of all patients. staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus spp. and enterococcus spp. were detected at rates of 3.2%, 8.1%, 0.7% and 1.0%, respectively, and 24.2% of isolated strains were gram-positive organisms. when species of isolates before treatment with antibacterial agents and their isolation rates were analyzed, it was found that the isolation rate of e. faecalis increased dramatically in 1983, and that this tendency was still seen in 1984. the isolation rate of gram-positive organisms was 25% in 1984 and 24.3% in 1985. escherichia coli was consistently isolated at about 40%, but, as far as simple urinary tract infections are concerned, its isolation rate decreased by about 10% in 1985, compared to 1982 and 1983. these results suggested that causative organisms for simple urinary tract infections became similar to those for complex urinary tract infections. in other words, isolates obtained from complex urinary tract infections before treatment were similar to those of simple infections.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
[clinical laboratory approach for estimating the effective administrative dose of latamoxef. significance of a 4-category system interpretation of the latamoxef disc susceptibility test].
in vitro activities of latamoxef (lmox) against 249 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. lmox was highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis (except 2 out of 30 strains) and proteus vulgaris with mic values below 3.13 micrograms/ml. it was also active against enterobacter aerogenes with mic80 of 1.56 micrograms/ml. lmox was less active against serratia marcescens, inhibiting about 43% of strains at a level of 6.25 micrograms/ml. it was also less active against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, showing mic80 of 12.5 and 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. lmox was not active against enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the reliability of the lmox disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (difco), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of lmox. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, hence the lmox disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of lmox. for the interpretation of lmox disc test results, if uniform break points of zone diameters were used to test all bacteria, inhibitory zone diameters of showa discs used on staphylococcus were relatively large compared to mics determined, probably due to decarboxylation of lmox sodium salt in the discs. however, those of difco discs were not, because difco discs use lmox ammonium salt. both discs also showed relatively large inhibitory zone diameters compared to mics determined against p. aeruginosa. using different break points from those used for other bacteria to interpret inhibition zones for staphylococcus and p. aeruginosa, these disc susceptivility tests should be useful to estimate approximate mics. a 3 category system for the interpretation of disc test results has been used in usa and europe, but a 4 category system is generally used in japan. the 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to mic values as follows: resistant (r) mic greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml, intermediate (i) mic 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (s) mic less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. the 4 category system uses break points as follows: mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
[ability to survive and interactions of selected bacterial species in activated carbon filters].
the survival and the interactions of selected, hygienically relevant bacterial species in activated carbon filters was investigated. the numbers of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and p. putida increased in previously sterilized filters. after inoculation all bacteria (10(6] were adsorbed. during a period of 6-10 days the filter effluent contained no detectable bacteria. after that the colony numbers increased to a constant level of 10(4)-10(5) colony forming units (cfu)/ml effluent and 10(6)-10(7) cfu/g activated carbon. klebsiella pneumoniae and streptococcus faecalis died off in the filter system. if the filters were inoculated simultaneously with two species, p. putida and p. aeruginosa remained at a constant level between 10(4) and 10(5) cfu/ml. e. coli was suppressed by p. aeruginosa and died off in the presence of p. putida. as in-vitro tests indicated, p. putida did not produce inhibitory substances against p. aeruginosa or e. coli. on the other hand, p. aeruginosa showed antagonistic activities against e. coli.
[occurrence and incidence of bacteria in the area of drinking water with antagonistic relations to indicator bacteria].
during a period of 8 months about 3000 drinking water samples derived from different water works and distribution systems around the area of the city bonn were examined for colony count, e. coli and coliform bacteria and bacteria suppressing the growth of e. coli and s. faecalis. a modified agar diffusion test was used for the determination of antagonistic substances. bacteria which revealed an antagonistic activity were isolated and identified. the majority of water samples (81.9% of the samples examined for antagonistic bacteria against e. coli) contained no bacteria in 1 ml and therefore were not examined for antagonistic substances. only 2.5% of the samples had bacterial counts greater 100 per ml. in 64.2% of the samples examined for bacteria antagonistic to s. faecalis, no counts were found and 2.4% had counts greater 100. the occurrence of fecal indicators was very low in samples with low colony forming units (cfu). at counts greater than 100 we found e. coli within 30.6% and coliform bacteria in 38.8% of the samples examined for bacteria showing antagonistic activity against e. coli. e. coli and coliform bacteria were determined in 24.2% and 33.3% of the samples examined for antagonistic bacteria against s. faecalis. 20% of the samples with colony counts between 1 to 10 contained bacteria showing antagonistic activity against e. coli and at counts greater than 100 they were found in 57.1% of the samples. on the other hand, the quantity of samples with suppression of s. faecalis was 10 to 20% lower and reached a maximum of 39.4% at cfu greater 100. most of the isolated antagonistic strains belong to the genus pseudomonas and even 57.8% of the inhibitory strains against e. coli and 26.5% against s. faecalis were found to be p. fluorescens.
[clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of ceftizoxime. observation from mic and ceftizoxime disc susceptibility test].
in vitro activities of ceftizoxime (czx) against 328 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. czx was highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and proteus vulgaris with mic values below 0.20 microgram/ml. it was also active against serratia marcescens and enterobacter aerogenes with mic85 of 3.13 micrograms/ml. czx was less active against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, showing inhibitory activities against only 47 and 78% of these clinical isolates, respectively, at a dose level of 12.5 micrograms/ml. czx was not active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis. the reliability of czx disc diffusion susceptibility tests for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (eiken), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of czx. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, hence the czx disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of czx, except against p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis. for the interpretation of czx disc tests, a 3 category system has been used in usa and europe, but a 4 category system is generally used in japan. the 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to mic values as follows: resistant (r) mic greater than 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (ms) mic 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (s) mic less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
the effect of transferrin and lysozyme on antibacterial activity of amniotic fluid.
amniotic fluid obtained from normal full term gestation inhibited the growth of e. coli, staph. aureus and b. subtilis, while ps. aeruginosa, str. faecalis and str. agalactiae proliferated readily in amniotic fluid. but when amniotic fluid was heated at 100 degrees c for 5 minutes, its antibacterial activity was completely lost. the levels of transferrin and lysozyme in amniotic fluid at term were determined to be 29.1 +/- 17.6 mg/100 ml (n = 90) and 19.1 +/- 8.3 micrograms/ml (n = 145), respectively. antibacterial activity against e. coli was restored by adding transferrin into heat-treated amniotic fluid at a concentration of 250 mg/100 ml or higher, but simultaneous addition of transferrin and sufficient concentration of iron to form a transferrin-iron complex resulted in the loss of antibacterial activities. when lysozyme was added to the amniotic fluid, which had lost its antibacterial activity through exposure to heat, the antibacterial effect on b. subtilis was restored. the growth of staph. aureus in heat-treated amniotic fluid was inhibited by the concomitant addition of lysozyme and aminobenzyl penicillin.
effect of organotins on fecal pollution indicator organisms.
pure cultures of escherichia coli and streptococcus faecalis and environmental water samples were examined for the possibility that pollution involving organotin compounds could decrease the values for indicator organisms when standard methods were applied to the analysis of water samples. (ch3)2sncl2 and (ch3)3sncl decreased viable counts at about 10 to 100 mg of sn liter-1 (8.4 x 10(-5) to 8.4 x 10(-4) mol of sn liter-1), and tributyltin chloride was effective at about 0.1 to 1.0 mg of sn liter-1 (8.4 x 10(-7) to 8.4 x 10(-6) mol of sn liter-1. these concentrations, particularly for the methyltin compounds, are greater than the concentrations reported to date for these compounds in aquatic ecosystems. thus, organotin compounds alone would not be likely to cause reductions in counts of indicator organisms measured by standard methods. however, it is suggested that, when combined with other environmental stressors or upon long exposure, organotins such as butyltins may contribute to the injury of indicator organisms.
[current status and the development of resistance of important urinary pathogens  to antibiotics in the suhl district 1970-1984].
in a retrospective study over a period from 1970 to 1984 the distribution of frequency and the behaviour of the resistance of urine germs out of more than 43,000 sendings from outpatient and hospital institutions of the county of suhl were analysed. in the period of observation the proportion of isolated e. coli redoubled and was nearly 68% in 1984. conspicuous were a decrease of the isolates of str. faecalis from 32 to 4% and an increase of problem germs of the klebsiella group to 9.7%. the resistance situation is characterized by a distinct decrease of the resistance of e. coli in comparison to antimicrobial substances with smaller consumption (sulphonamides, chloramphenicol, nitrafurantoin) without homogeneous behaviour of the problem germs.
sepsis and cholestasis: the in vitro effects of bacterial products on 14c-taurocholate uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.
bacterial endotoxins are known to be an important cause of cholestasis, yet not all organisms that cause cholestasis produce endotoxins. in order to determine whether bacterial products other than endotoxins may be involved in the cholestasis process, 14c-taurocholate (tc) uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes was measured in the presence of mid-log, stationary and mid-death phase bacterial broth supernatants from eight common bacterial pathogens. the results were then correlated with a quantitative assessment of endotoxin production by each organism. supernatants from haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumonia demonstrated a striking inhibitory effect on bile salt uptake (77.2 +/- 6.7, 46.9 +/- 6.5 and 32.9 +/- 7.1% maximum inhibition of 14c-tc uptake, respectively) when compared to sterile broth controls. streptococcus faecalis (enterococcus), escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and bacteroides fragilis products, on the other hand, had relatively minor effects (12.3 +/- 5.2, 12.0 +/- 7.5, 8.4 +/- 6.7 and less than 5.0% inhibition respectively), while those from proteus mirabilis had an intermediate effect (18.5 +/- 8.3% inhibition). bile salt efflux rates (16.0 +/- 2.7 and 25.1 +/- 4.2 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, mean +/- sem) were similar in bacteria demonstrating marked uptake inhibition (haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa) when compared to those with only minor inhibitory effects (staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis) (14.3 +/- 1.1 and 18.4 +/- 2.6 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, respectively, p greater than 0.05). 14c-tc uptake inhibition did not correlate with the amount of endotoxin produced by each organism (r = 0.251). the results of this study indicate that bacteria produce a factor other than endotoxin that significantly inhibits bile salt uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
[influence of cefroxadine dry syrup on intestinal bacterial flora].
influence of cefroxadine (cxd) dry syrup on intestinal bacterial flora was studied in mice infected with 4 species of bacteria, namely, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis and bifidobacterium breve, and in pediatric patients having infections in the respiratory tract and cutaneous/soft tissues. the results were summarized as follows: cxd dry syrup was administered for 5 consecutive days to mice infected with the 4 species. no considerable changes were observed in levels of bacteria in the feces and in different parts of digestive tracts. eleven pediatric patients were orally administered with 30-54 mg/kg of cxd dry syrup a day for 7-15 consecutive days. symptom of diarrhea was noted in 2 patients. dominant species of the intestinal flora such as e. coli, bifidobacterium, and bacteroides sometimes decreased in patients treated with cxd dry syrup. in general, however, decreases in numbers of these bacteria were insignificant. changes of intestinal flora in patients treated with cxd dry syrup were apparently smaller than those treated with ampicillin and were similar to those treated with cephalexin or amoxicillin.
escherichia coli adherence to anion exchange resin. in vitro model for initial screening of potential antiadherence agents.
the first step in developing a bladder infection is attachment of bacteria to the bladder epithelium. removing the bladder mucin increases bacterial adherence up to a thousand-fold, and this increase can be prevented by pretreating the mucin-deficient bladder with heparin. to develop a rapid, in vitro antiadherence screening assay, we studied the adherence of escherichia coli to various chromatography resins and the ability of heparin and other agents to antagonize this attachment. the results can be summarized as follows: although e. coli attached to all resins, only the adherence to the anion exchange resin was inhibited by heparin (up to 95%). agents which did not effect e. coli adherence to the resin did not affect attachment to the bladder. agents which inhibited e. coli adherence to the bladder also inhibited e. coli adherence to the resin. similar to the effect of heparin on e. coli attachment, the adherence of klebsiella ozaene, proteus mirabilis, and streptococcus fecalis to both bladder epithelium and anion exchange resin were also antagonized. these studies indicate that the adherence of e. coli (as well as other bacterial species) to anion exchange resin responds to heparin and other chemical agents in a similar manner as does adherence to the mucin-deficient rabbit urinary bladder. because of the ease and rapid nature of this in vitro assay, it serves as a useful screen for potential bacterial antiadherence agents and could be used to help elucidate mechanisms of bacterial attachment.
further characterization of bacterial adherence to urinary bladder mucosa: comparison with adherence to anion exchange resin.
bacterial adherence to anion exchange resin has recently been reported to provide a useful, rapid, in vitro screening assay for identifying putative antiadherence agents. the studies presented in this report provide additional evidence that adherence to anion exchange resin is similar to urinary bladder mucosa adherence. results are as follows. 1) heparin inhibits the adherence of escherichia coli, klebsiella ozaenae, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus fecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa to both the mucin deficient bladder and anion exchange resin. 2) drugs which inhibit e. coli adherence to the bladder also inhibit e. coli adherence to the resin and conversely, drugs which do not effect e. coli adherence to the resin do not affect attachment to the bladder. 3) extracts from mammalian urinary bladder mucosa prevent e. coli adherence to both the bladder and resin. 4) the ability of heparin to displace preattached bacteria from anion exchange resin is inversely proportional to the time the bacteria are in contact with resin. similar results were obtained for the ability of heparin to displace bacteria from the bladder. these studies indicate that bacterial adherence to anion exchange resin responds to heparin and other chemical agents in a manner similar to the mucin deficient rabbit urinary bladder. because of the ease and rapid nature of this in vitro assay, it serves as a useful screen for potential bacterial antiadherence agents and could be used to help elucidate mechanisms of bacterial attachment.
bactericidal activity of ciprofloxacin in serum and urine against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis.
ten volunteers received three doses of 500 mg ciprofloxacin, orally every 12 hours. after the last dose, mean serum levels were (mg/l +/- sd) 2.4 +/- 0.83 at 1 h; 0.91 +/- 0.30 at 4 h and 0.18 +/- 0.04 at 12 h. at 1 h the median serum bactericidal activity was satisfactory only against the escherichia coli (1:256) and klebsiella pneumoniae (1:128). in urine collected from 0 to 4 h and 8 to 12 h after the last dose, the mean ciprofloxacin level was respectively 482.5 +/- 324.7 and 80.9 +/- 48.2 mg/l +/- sd. bactericidal activity in urine was high even against the least susceptible species tested: pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis. a post antibiotic effect was demonstrated in 22 out of the 29 strains tested, ranging mainly from 1 to 3 h. ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice a day is a bactericidal regimen against a wide range of urinary pathogens but has a limited systemic activity.
[comparative antibacterial activity of piperacillin against pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and streptococcus faecalis in cultures and human serum].
the in vitro activity of piperacillin at 1/4, 1 and 4 x mhk against 5 strains each of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and streptococcus faecalis was compared in mueller-hinton-bouillon and human serum. serum without piperacillin was bacteriostatic against p. aeruginosa for 8 hrs., against e. coli for 24 hrs. subinhibitory piperacillin concentrations were bacteriostatic against e. coli, but had no effect against p. aeruginosa and s. faecalis. bactericidal activity against e. coli was achieved at 1 x mhk against p. aeruginosa and s. faecalis at 4 x mhk. except for p. aeruginosa in concentrations of 1/4 and 1 x mhk the piperacillin activity in bouillon and serum was almost identical.
evaluation of a surfactant mixture c31g as a teat dip by a modified excised teat  model.
a mixture of amphoteric surfactants with antimicrobial properties, c31g, was evaluated as a teat dip by a modified excised teat model. the model was modified to avoid misinterpretation of results from indigenous bacterial microflora on teats. in three experiments, bacterial numbers recovered from teats dipped in .75, 1.5, and 3.0% solutions of c31g were compared with bacteria recovered from undipped teats (negative controls) and teats dipped with 1.0% iodophor (an effective teat dip). mean log reductions of teat end concentrations of staphylococcus, aureus, streptococcus fecalis, and escherichia coli were determined in each experiment. efficacy was greatest for the 3.0% solution of c31g with mean log reductions (log reduction = log 10 of controls - log 10 of dipped teats) 3.53 for staphylococcus aureus, 2.89 for streptococcus fecalis, and 3.16 for escherichia coli. iodophor (1%) yielded mean log reductions of 3.26 for staphylococcus aureus, 2.16 for streptococcus fecalis, and 2.83 for escherichia coli. for all three organisms, number of viable organisms decreased with increasing concentrations of c31g. the efficacy of c31g should be evaluated in vivo.
application of s. faecalis and e. coli oral vaccines in humans and animals.
vaccines of non-pathogenic intestinal bacteria for oral administration have been  used in the therapy of chronic and recurrent infections by the german medical association for microbiological therapy for over three decades. three different oral bacterial vaccines were used in particular: 1. a sterile autolysate of non-pathogenic s. faecalis and e. coli; 2. a viable non-pathogenic s. faecalis vaccine, and; 3. a viable non-pathogenic e. coli vaccine. clinical studies indicate the safety and efficacy of these bacterial products, and suggest the stimulation of immune activities and competitive capacities of s. faecalis and e. coli as mode of action. in animal experiments, orally administered intestinal bacterial vaccines enhance the resistance of mice against subsequent challenge with lethal doses of salmonella typhimurium and haemophilus influenzae. mice were allowed access to a viable suspension of either s. faecalis or e. coli for at least 3 weeks. they were then challenged with either of the two unrelated pathogens. both pre-treatment procedures conferred significant protection of the animals. the mechanism of this protective action appears to involve modification of white blood cell kinetics in the mice. the peritoneal resident cell population in mice is significantly increased by s. faecalis treatment.
influence of escherichia coli on streptococcus faecalis in mixed cultures and experimental animal infections.
strains of escherichia coli (four strains) and streptococcus faecalis (three strains) randomly isolated from faecal samples were cultured together in vitro and in experimental animal infections in order to evaluate the interaction of these two species. streptococcus faecalis was eliminated from mixed cultures and infections at population ratios of escherichia coli to streptococcus faecalis of 10-100:1. the mechanism involved was probably an antibiotic substance produced by escherichia coli which was antagonistic to streptococcus faecalis. the substance appeared to be diffusible, water-soluble, of low molecular weight and insensitive to the protease trypsin. it was produced and remained active in vitro and in vivo and can probably be classified as a microcin.
nucleoside 5'-monophosphate analogues. synthesis of 5'-sulfamino-5'-deoxynucleosides.
the synthesis of two new nucleotide analogues is described. 5'-sulfamino-5'-deoxyadenosine (1) was prepared by reaction of 5'-amino-5'-deoxyadenosine with (ch3)3n.203, and 5'-sulfamino-5'-deoxythymidine (2) was prepared from 5'-amino-5'-deoxythymidine by a similar reaction. the 5'-sulfamino nucleosides are shown to be quite stable to hydrolysis in acidic or basic aqueous solution tests show that these compounds do not inhibit the growth of escherichia coli or l1210 cells at concentrations less than 10(-4) m. at 10(-4) m compound 2 was found to give 70% inhibition of the replication of herpes simplex virus (type 1) with no effect on host cell growth (cv-1 monkey line).
antimicrobial systems of the surgical wound. ii. detection of antimicrobial protein in cell-free wound fluid.
human wound fluid contains heat-stable proteins with moderate antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli, and different heat-labile proteins with antibacterial activity against e coli. blood serum also contains heat-labile antibacterial substances, but little heat-stable activity against staphylococcus aureus. both blood serum and wound fluid have bacteriostatic activity against s epidermidis, and early growth of streptococcus fecalis occurs in serum and wound fluids. the concentration or activity of antimicrobial proteins increases during the first week in the fresh wound and then decreases as the wound matures.
on the mode of action of 5-diazouracil on bacterial cell division.
cell division by strains of escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium is inhibited by 5-diazouracil (5-du). division recovers in the presence of the inhibitor after a period which is temperature-dependent. recovery is probably due to breakdown of 5-du and the rate of this breakdown is apparently increased at alkaline ph. growth with 5-du caused only a slight reduction in the rate of murein synthesis and no alteration in the properties or composition of membranes of s. typhimurium. the agent caused chaining in streptococcus fecalis and inhibition of the penicillin-induced lysis of s. typhimurium. these effects may have been due to direct inhibition of lysin activity but an indirect effect seems more likely. the most marked effect of 5-du on s. typhimurium was to cause a transient inhibition of dna synthesis. since 5-du did not stop uncoupled cell division (i.e. division occurring independently of dna replication) and since lon- strains were more sensitive to 5-du than lon+ strains, it was concluded that 5-du acts on cell division via an inhibitory effect on dna replication.
factors that may prevent transfer of anti-biotic resistance between gram-negative bacteria in the gut.
antibiotic-resistance transfer between populations of donor and recipient strains of escherichia coli was completely inhibited in broth by dense suspensions of bacteroides fragilis. comparable amounts of inert bacterial matter (for-molised suspensions of e. coli or b. fragilis), or smaller numbers of viable b. fragilis, streptococcus faecalis, staphylococcus albus, neisseria catarrhalis, or solutions of sodium taurocholate or glycocholate were only moderately inhibitory. anaeroboisis had no effect upon plasmid transfer. population densities of enteric organisms in these studies were similar to those found in faeces. the presence of dense cultures of b. fragilis provide a satisfactory explanation for almost total inhibition of conjugation in the human gut. other factors inhibiting conjugation to a lesser degree may reinforce the effect of b. fragilis in vivo. as well as selecting for resistant organisms, antibiotics may also indirectly increase populations of r factor-bearing organisms in the gut by interfering with the anaerobic flora and so permit an increase in the frequency of conjugation.
synthesis and microbiological activities of some monohalogenated analogs of tyrosine.
2-chlorotyrosine and 2-bromotyrosine, as well as the previously reported 2-fluorotyrosine, were synthesized by hydrolysis of the condensation products from the appropriate benzyl bromide and ethyl acetamidomalonate and were compared with the corresponding 3-halotyrosines as growth inhibitors of escherichia coli 9723, streptococcus faecalis 8043 and lactobacillus plantarum 8014. in contrast to the 2- and 3-fluorotyrosines which were equally effective as growth inhibitors, the 2-chloro- and 2-bromotyrosines were much more effective than the 3-chloro- and 3-bromotyrosines in inhibiting the growth of the three microorganisms. for each of the assay organisms, the growth inhibitions of all three 2-halotyrosines were reversed competitively in varying degrees by tyrosine.
effect of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide on growth and membrane-mediated processes in wild type and heptose-deficient mutants of escherichia coli k-12.
the effects of n,n'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (dccd) on the growth of streptococcus faecalis, and on the growth, beta-galactosidase synthesis, and various membrane-mediated processes, were studied in wild-type escherichia coli je1011 and its lipopolysaccharide-defective mutant ns1. dccd (0.1 mm) completely inhibited the growth of s. faecalis and e. coli ns1 but had little effect on strain je1011. the same amount of dccd with e. coli ns1, but not with e. coli je1011, inhibited the induction of beta-galactosidase, increased the permeability of the cells to o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactoside without causing extensive cell lysis or release of ultraviolet-absorbing materials, and inhibited the oxidation of certain intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. inhibition of the oxidation of malate, fumarate, and alpha-ketoglutarate by dccd appeared to be at the level of the transport system for these compounds. inhibition of the membrane-bound adenosine triphosphatase by dccd was not entirely responsible for these effects, since oxidation of these substances, and transport of [(14)c]succinate and [(14)c]fumarate, was inhibited by dccd in a mutant, n(144), which lacked adenosine triphosphatase activity. it is concluded that lipopolysaccharide forms a barrier to dccd in wild-type e. coli, and that dccd can inhibit several processes in the cell.
function of various intestinal bacteria in converting germfree mice to the normal state.
earlier work had shown that a collection of anaerobic bacteria, in conjunction with facultative anaerobes, may be implanted into germfree mice, thereby rendering the animals "normal" with respect to a variety of parameters tested. the present experiments indicate that a different collection of anaerobic bacteria, isolated from the cecum of normal mice, was necessary to convert germfree mice to the "normal" state when the animals were fed a crude diet, rather than the refined food which had been used in the earlier work. the nature and level of short-chain fatty acids associated with various natural or synthetic "normal" floras in the ceca of mice did not always correlate with the escherichia coli population present, indicating that fatty acids were not the sole agents inhibiting bacterial populations in the intestine. experiments are reported which indicate that intestinal anaerobes may under certain circumstances be sufficient to control the populations of other intestinal bacteria such as e. coli. in other instances, such as control of shigella populations in the mouse intestine, intestinal anaerobes appeared to act synergistically with an e. coli strain, in spite of the fact that the population of the latter was itself suppressed by the anaerobes.
antibacterial activity of nifuratel in urine and serum.
the minimum inhibitory concentrations of nifuratel for 205 randomly selected isolates from urinary tract infections were tested by tube dilution. of these, 177 (86.3%) were resistant to more than 6 mug/ml and 140 of 141 (99.3%) strains of escherichia coli were resistant to more than 3 mug/ml. urine levels of nifuratel were examined in two groups: one group had 400 mg given once and the other group had 2 g given over 24 hours. in both groups samples of urine were collected every hour for seven hours after the last dose. after one 400-mg dose the maximum urine level achieved by any subject was 2.0 mug/ml and the mean maximum level was 0.75 mug/ml. with the 2 g total dose, the maximum level noted was 4 mug/ml and the mean maximum level was 1.8 mug/ml. no measurable inhibition was noted in any of the blood samples removed at one and a half to two hours after the last dose.
nicotinamide deamidation by microorganisms in rat stomach.
we have extended our investigation of nicotinamide deamidation in the stomach of  conventional rats. the bacterial species in the pars preventricularis were identified as flavobacterium peregrinum, escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, and lactobacillus acidophilus, listed in order of decreasing deamidase activity. nicotinamide-7-(14)c ingested into rat stomach was rapidly deamidated to nicotinic acid. these results contribute to the accumulated evidence that microorganisms present in the pars preventricularis of rat stomach are responsible for the deamidation of nicotinamide to nicotinic acid, a known precursor of mammalian pyridine nucleotides.
membrane adenosine triphosphatase of escherichia coli: activation by calcium ion  and inhibition by monovalent cations.
membrane ghost preparations of escherichia coli k-12 obtained by osmotic lysis of lysozyme-induced spheroplasts were found to possess both mg(++)- and ca(++)-activated adenosine 5'-triphosphatase (atpase, ec 3.6.1.3) activities. maximal activities of 1.0 to 1.5 mumoles of orthophosphate released per min per mg of protein were obtained at ph 9.0 with a molar mg(++) to adenosine 5'triphosphate (atp) ratio of 2:5 and at ph 9.9 with a molar ca(++) to atp ratio of 1:5. these atpase activities were not altered by ouabain, fluoride, n-ethylmaleimide, 2,4-dinitrophenol, cyanide, or dithionite, but were inhibited by low concentrations of azide, p-chloromercuribenzoate, and pentachlorophenol. mg(++) atpase was more susceptible to inhibition by azide than was ca(++) atpase. fifty per cent inactivation of both activities was observed when membrane ghost preparations were preincubated at 66 c for 10 min. the mg(++) and ca(++) atpase activities of these preparations were not additive, but did respond independently to inhibition by monovalent cations. ca(++) atpase was found to be very sensitive to inhibition by k(+), na(+), li(+), rb(+), and cs(+); mg(++) atpase was relatively insensitive to these ions. one possible interpretation of the results presented in this paper is that the membrane of e. coli possesses an atpase which is activated by either mg(++) or ca(++) and that activation by ca(++) increases the susceptibility of this enzyme to inhibition by monovalent cations. increased susceptibility of e. coli membrane atpase to inhibition by monovalent cations such as na(+) and k(+) as a consequence of ca(++) activation could represent a regulatory mechanism.
bacteriocin (hemolysin) of streptococcus zymogenes.
the sensitivity of streptococcus faecalis (attc 8043) to s. zymogenes x-14 bacteriocin depends greatly on its physiological age. sensitivity decreases from the mid-log phase on and is completely lost in the stationary phase. the sensitivity of erythrocytes to the hemolytic capacity of the bacteriocin showed considerable species variation. the order of increasing sensitivity was goose < sheep < dog < horse < human < rabbit. however, when red cell stromata were used as inhibitors of hemolysis in a standard system employing rabbit erythrocytes the order of increasing effectiveness was sheep < rabbit < human < horse < goose. when rabbit cells were used in varying concentrations with a constant hemolysin concentration, there was a lag of about 30 min, which for a given hemolysin preparation was constant for all red cell concentrations. furthermore, the rate of hemolysis increased with increasing red cell concentration. if red cells are held constant and lysin varied, the time to reach half-maximal lysis varies directly with lysin but is not strictly proportional. bacterial membranes were one to three orders of magnitude more effective than red cell stromata as inhibitors. the order of increasing effectiveness seems to be escherichia coli < bacillus megaterium < s. faecalis < micrococcus lysodeikticus. in addition to membranes, a d-alanine containing glycerol teichoic acid, trypsin in high concentration, and deoxyribonuclease also inhibited hemolysis. ribonuclease, d-alanine, l-alanine, dl-alanyl-dl-alanine, n-acetyl-d-alanine, n-acetyl-l-alanine did not inhibit hemolysis.
effect of hydroxylysine on the biosynthesis of lysine in streptococcus faecalis.
we were able to show that two lysine-independent mutants of streptococcus faecalis atcc 8043 contained the enzymes for the usual bacterial pathway for lysine biosynthesis. because of this synthetic capacity, one mutant, the lys(+)ohlys(s) strain, could not grow in the presence of hydroxylysine without a lysine supplement. both lysine and hydroxylysine inhibited the first enzyme of the pathway, aspartokinase. unlike the escherichia coli enzyme, s. faecalis dihydrodipicolinic acid synthetase was not inhibited by either lysine or hydroxylysine. both amino acids caused the repression of dihydrodipicolinic acid synthetase and diaminopimelic acid decarboxylase. failure of lys(+)ohlys(s) strain to grow in hydroxylysine-supplemented medium was caused by the mimicking of lysine control by hydroxylysine. because hydroxylysine could not completely substitute for lysine and lysine could not be synthesized, the organism did not grow. we tested three lysine analogues and found that they prevented lysine-depletion lysis in the lsy(-)ohlys(s) strain, as did hydroxylysine. each analogue seemed to support cell wall mucopeptide synthesis, although ornithine did not. preliminary data indicated that these analogues like hydroxylysine, have growth-inhibitory action on the lys(+)ohlys(s) strain, but not the lys(+)ohlys(r) strain. the nature of the specificity of the lysine-adding enzyme for cell wall mucopeptide synthesis is discussed.
cell multiplication studied with an electronic particle counter.
toennies, g. (institute for cancer research, philadelphia, pa.), l. iszard, n. b. rogers, and g. d. shockman. cell multiplication studied with an electronic particle counter. j. bacteriol. 82:857-866. 1961.-suitable conditions are described for the application of the counter electronic particle counter to the study of bacterial number and particle size distribution in growing cultures. when streptococcus faecalis and escherichia coli were each grown in a different medium, exponential growth was accompanied by a continuous decrease in average particle size. the average apparent particle volume of s. faecalis decreased by about 50% in five generations. microscopic studies of s. faecalis indicated that this was due to a decrease in the average chain length of the cultures. the following observations concerning average particle size during exponential growth of s. faecalis in a synthetic medium were made: (i) a decreased concentration of tryptophan, serine, or proline resulted in a significant decrease in average particle size. similar changes in numerous other nutrients produced no or only minor changes. (ii) the addition of a cytoplasmic extract prepared from exponentially growing cells resulted in changes similar to those resulting from the partial withdrawal from the medium of certain nutrients. (iii) the effect of the cytoplasmic extract could be counteracted by the addition of tryptophan. (iv) a limited survey, including the effects of the rate of exponential growth, mechanical agitation, the presence of indoleacetic acid, indole, kinetin, lysozyme, or ascorbate, disclosed no additional factor which significantly influenced the particle size distribution.
