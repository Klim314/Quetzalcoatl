TI  - [The application and epidemiological research of xTAG GPP multiplex PCR in the diagnosis of infectious diarrhea].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the application value of xTAG ((R)) gastrointestinal pathogen panel (xTAG9((R)) GPP) multiplex PCR in the early diagnosis of infectious diarrhea, and understand the epidemiology of intestinal diarrhea pathogens. METHODS: Five hundred and ninety two specimens were collected in outpatient of Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, from 1st Oct 2013 to 30th Sep 2014, comparing the xTAG((R)) GPP multiplex PCR assay with the traditional methods (culture, rapid enzyme immunoassay chromatography, microscopic examination, Real-time PCR) and mading the statistical analysis. RESULTS: The positive rate of 592 patients with diarrhea specimens was 47.8% (283/592), the proportion of male and female was 1: 1.02, the average age was 31years. The virus detection rate was 18.1%, Rotavirus A was the most common organism detected (8.8%), concentrated in winter, popular in children.Secondly,Norovirus GI/GII (8.4%),Adenovirus 40/41 was five cases. The positive rate of bacteria was 35.5%, Enterotoxigenic E.coli (8.4%, 50/592) was most frequently detected in summer, common in young adults. The other pathogens were Campylobacter 7.7%, Salmonella 7.0%, Clostridium difficile toxinA/B 3.5%, Shigella 3.3%,E.coli O157 3.3% and Shiga toxin-producing E.coli LT/ST 1.7%.None of Yersinia enterocolitica and Vibrio cholerae was detected. There were ten samples with parasitic (1.7%), five samples were positive for Cryptosporidium, three for Entamoeba histolytica and two for Giardia. All of them did not have obvious distribution followed by season and population. Totally 242(40.8%) infected specimens with single pathogen were detected. There were 41 (6.9%) co-infections samples, including two pathogens 36 cases (6.1%), three pathogens in 5 cases (0.8%). CONCLUSIONS: xTAG((R)) GPP multiplex PCR is simple, sensitive, specific and can be used as a quick way to diagnose the infectious diarrhea. Diarrhea pathogen has significant characteristics with the season and crowd.
TI  - Microbiological diversity and prevalence of spoilage and pathogenic bacteria in commercial fermented alcoholic beverages (beer, fruit wine, refined rice wine, and yakju).
AB  - The present study examined 469 commercially available fermented alcoholic beverages (FABs), including beer (draft, microbrewed, and pasteurized), fruit wine (grape and others), refined rice wine, and yakju (raw and pasteurized). Samples were screened for Escherichia coli and eight foodborne pathogens (Bacillus cereus, Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and Yersinia enterocolitica), and the aerobic plate count, lactic acid bacteria, acetic acid bacteria, fungi, and total coliforms were also enumerated. Microbrewed beer contained the highest number of microorganisms (average aerobic plate count, 3.5; lactic acid bacteria, 2.1; acetic acid bacteria, 2.0; and fungi, 3.6 log CFU/ml), followed by draft beer and yakju (P < 0.05), whereas the other FABs contained , 25 CFU/25 ml microorganisms. Unexpectedly, neither microbial diversity nor microbial count correlated with the alcohol content (4.7 to 14.1%) or pH (3.4 to 4.2) of the product. Despite the harsh conditions, coliforms (detected in 23.8% of microbrewed beer samples) and B. cereus (detected in all FABs) were present in some products. B. cereus was detected most frequently in microbrewed beer (54.8% of samples) and nonpasteurized yakju (50.0%), followed by pasteurized yakju (28.8%), refined rice wine (25.0%), other fruit wines (12.3%), grape wine (8.6%), draft beer (5.6%), and pasteurized beer (2.2%) (P < 0.05). The finding that spore-forming B. cereus and coliform bacteria can survive the harsh conditions present in alcoholic beverages should be taken into account (alongside traditional quality indicators such as the presence of lactic acid-producing bacteria, acetic acid-producing bacteria, or both) when developing manufacturing systems and methods to prolong the shelf life of high-quality FAB products. New strategic quality management plans for various FABs are needed.
TI  - Expert elicitation as a means to attribute 28 enteric pathogens to foodborne, waterborne, animal contact, and person-to-person transmission routes in Canada.
AB  - Enteric illness contributes to a significant burden of illness in Canada and globally. Understanding its sources is a critical step in identifying and preventing health risks. Expert elicitation is a powerful tool, used previously, to obtain information about enteric illness source attribution where information is difficult or expensive to obtain. Thirty-one experts estimated transmission of 28 pathogens via major transmission routes (foodborne, waterborne, animal contact, person-to-person, and other) at the point of consumption. The elicitation consisted of a (snowball) recruitment phase; administration of a pre-survey to collect background information, an introductory webinar, an elicitation survey, a 1-day discussion, survey readministration, and a feedback exercise, and surveys were administered online. Experts were prompted to quantify changes in contamination at the point of entry into the kitchen versus point of consumption. Estimates were combined via triangular probability distributions, and medians and 90% credible-interval estimates were produced. Transmission was attributed primarily to food for Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Cyclospora cayetanensis, Trichinella spp., all three Vibrio spp. categories explored, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Multisource pathogens (e.g., transmitted commonly through both water and food) such as Campylobacter spp., four Escherichia coli categories, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., and Staphylococcus aureus were also estimated as mostly foodborne. Water was the primary pathway for Giardia spp. and Cryptosporidium spp., and person-to-person transmission dominated for six enteric viruses and Shigella spp. Consideration of the point of attribution highlighted the importance of food handling and cross-contamination in the transmission pathway. This study provides source attribution estimates of enteric illness for Canada, considering all possible transmission routes. Further research is necessary to improve our understanding of poorly characterized pathogens such as sapovirus and E. coli subgroups in Canada.
TI  - Effects of climate change on the persistence and dispersal of foodborne bacterial pathogens in the outdoor environment: A review.
AB  - Abstract According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), warming of the climate system is unequivocal. Over the coming century, warming trends such as increased duration and frequency of heat waves and hot extremes are expected in some areas, as well as increased intensity of some storm systems. Climate-induced trends will impact the persistence and dispersal of foodborne pathogens in myriad ways, especially for environmentally ubiquitous and/or zoonotic microorganisms. Animal hosts of foodborne pathogens are also expected to be impacted by climate change through the introduction of increased physiological stress and, in some cases, altered geographic ranges and seasonality. This review article examines the effects of climatic factors, such as temperature, rainfall, drought and wind, on the environmental dispersal and persistence of bacterial foodborne pathogens, namely, Bacillus cereus, Brucella, Campylobacter, Clostridium, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio and Yersinia enterocolitica. These relationships are then used to predict how future climatic changes will impact the activity of these microorganisms in the outdoor environment and associated food safety issues. The development of predictive models that quantify these complex relationships will also be discussed, as well as the potential impacts of climate change on transmission of foodborne disease from animal hosts.
TI  - Multicenter evaluation of the BioFire FilmArray gastrointestinal panel for etiologic diagnosis of infectious gastroenteritis.
AB  - The appropriate treatment and control of infectious gastroenteritis depend on the ability to rapidly detect the wide range of etiologic agents associated with the disease. Clinical laboratories currently utilize an array of different methodologies to test for bacterial, parasitic, and viral causes of gastroenteritis, a strategy that suffers from poor sensitivity, potentially long turnaround times, and complicated ordering practices and workflows. Additionally, there are limited or no testing methods routinely available for most diarrheagenic Escherichia coli strains, astroviruses, and sapoviruses. This study assessed the performance of the FilmArray Gastrointestinal (GI) Panel for the simultaneous detection of 22 different enteric pathogens directly from stool specimens: Campylobacter spp., Clostridium difficile (toxin A/B), Plesiomonas shigelloides, Salmonella spp., Vibrio spp., Vibrio cholerae, Yersinia enterocolitica, enteroaggregative E. coli, enteropathogenic E. coli, enterotoxigenic E. coli, Shiga-like toxin-producing E. coli (stx1 and stx2) (including specific detection of E. coli O157), Shigella spp./enteroinvasive E. coli, Cryptosporidium spp., Cyclospora cayetanensis, Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia lamblia, adenovirus F 40/41, astrovirus, norovirus GI/GII, rotavirus A, and sapovirus. Prospectively collected stool specimens (n = 1,556) were evaluated using the BioFire FilmArray GI Panel and tested with conventional stool culture and molecular methods for comparison. The FilmArray GI Panel sensitivity was 100% for 12/22 targets and >/=94.5% for an additional 7/22 targets. For the remaining three targets, sensitivity could not be calculated due to the low prevalences in this study. The FilmArray GI Panel specificity was >/=97.1% for all panel targets. The FilmArray GI Panel provides a comprehensive, rapid, and streamlined alternative to conventional methods for the etiologic diagnosis of infectious gastroenteritis in the laboratory setting. The potential advantages include improved performance parameters, a more extensive menu of pathogens, and a turnaround time of as short as 1 h.
TI  - Detection of major diarrheagenic bacterial pathogens by multiplex PCR panels.
AB  - Diarrheal diseases remain a major threat to the youngest population in low- and middle-income countries. The main bacterial pathogens causing diarrhea are diarrheagenic Escherichia coli (DEC) that consists of enteroaggregative (EAEC), enteropathogenic (EPEC), enterotoxigenic (ETEC), enterohemorrhagic EHEC and enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC), Salmonella, Shigella spp. (S. dysenteria, S. sonnei, S. flexneri) Campylobacter (C. coli, C. jejuni), Vibrio (V. vulnificus, V. parahaemolyticusm, V. cholerae), Yersinia enterocolitica and Aeromonas hydrophila. The aim of this study was to set up rapid multiplex PCR (mPCR) panels to identify these diarrheagenic pathogens based on their specific virulence genes. Primers against specific target genes were combined into three mPCR panels: one for diarrheal E. coli, one for pathogens causing mainly bloody diarrhea, and the third for the remaining pathogens. The panels were tested against a set of stool samples from Swedish children with diarrhea and controls and the analysis identified bacterial pathogens in 14/54 (26%) of the samples. These results show that our three developed mPCR panels can detect main bacterial diarrheagenic pathogens in clinical samples.
TI  - Impact of Aeromonas and diarrheagenic Escherichia coli screening in patients with diarrhea in Parana, southern Brazil.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: A wide diversity of bacterial agents may cause diarrhea, presenting challenges to clinical laboratories to define a diagnosis. Considering that most stool cultures are negative, we screened stool samples from patients with diarrhea for the presence of 14 bacterial enteropathogens, aiming to establish which of them should be included in routine stool analysis. METHODOLOGY: Stool samples from 400 patients with diarrhea were analyzed for the presence of Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Aeromonas, Plesiomonas shigelloides, Vibrio, Yersinia enterocolitica, and diarrheagenic Escherichia coli using conventional microbiological methods and PCR. Two distinct samples were studied; one included predominantly patients involved in outbreaks, and the other patients of low socioeconomic status presenting sporadic cases of diarrhea. RESULTS: In total, 86 cultures (21.5%) were positive. Mixed infections were found in five patients, leading to recovery of 91 strains of enteropathogenic bacteria: Salmonella Enteritidis (9.2%), Aeromonas (7.2%), diarrheagenic E. coli (5.2%), and C. jejuni (1%). However, Salmonella predominated, with 11.5% frequency in diarrhea outbreaks, while Aeromonas predominated among patients of low socioeconomic status, with 14.6% frequency. CONCLUSION: Aeromonas and diarrheagenic E. coli, which are not routinely screened for, deserve to be included in laboratory screening panels.
TI  - Evaluation of a real-time multiplex PCR for the simultaneous detection of Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp./EIEC, and Yersinia enterocolitica in fecal samples.
AB  - Conventional diagnosis of infectious diarrhea caused by bacteria is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and has a suboptimal sensitivity. We have therefore developed a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the simultaneous detection of Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp./enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC), and Yersinia enterocolitica in fecal samples. No cross reactivity between the different pathogens was observed, and the multiplex setup of the assay did not have an impact on the sensitivity of the PCR. The analytical sensitivity was 87 CFU/mL for C. jejuni, 61 CFU/mL for Shigella spp./EIEC, 5,528 CFU/mL for Salmonella spp., and 1,306 CFU/mL for Y. enterocolitica. An extensive validation of the assay was performed by testing 1,687 patient samples by both PCR and with conventional techniques. The use of PCR increased the overall clinical sensitivity from 78 to 100 % (p < 0.0001), the specificity was 99.4 % for the PCR, compared with 99.9 % for conventional culture. The novel PCR assay allows for rapid, sensitive, inexpensive, and high-throughput testing of the most common bacterial causes of gastroenteritis.
TI  - Prevalence and characterization of foodborne pathogens from Australian dairy farm environments.
AB  - The ability of foodborne pathogens to gain entry into food supply systems remains an ongoing concern. In dairy products, raw milk acts as a major vehicle for this transfer; however, the sources of pathogenic bacteria that contaminate raw milk are often not clear, and environmental sources of contamination or the animals themselves may contribute to the transfer. This survey examined the occurrence of 9 foodborne pathogens in raw milk and environments of 7 dairy farms (3 bovine, 3 caprine, and 1 ovine farm) in summer and autumn, in Victoria, Australia. A total of 120 samples were taken from sampling points common to dairy farms, including pasture, soil, feed, water sources, animal feces, raw milk, and milk filters. The prevalence of the Bacillus cereus group, Campylobacter, Clostridium perfringens, Cronobacter, Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli, Listeria, Salmonella, coagulase-positive staphylococci (CPS), and Yersinia enterocolitica across the farms was investigated. The 2 most prevalent bacteria, which were detected on all farms, were the B. cereus group, isolated from 41% of samples, followed by Cl. perfringens, which was isolated from 38% of samples. The highest occurrence of any pathogen was the B. cereus group in soil, present in 93% of samples tested. Fecal samples showed the highest diversity of pathogens, containing 7 of the 9 pathogens tested. Salmonella was isolated from 1 bovine farm, although it was found in multiple samples on both visits. Out of the 14 occurrences where any pathogen was detected in milk filters, only 5 (36%) of the corresponding raw milk samples collected at the same time were positive for the same pathogen. All of the CPS were Staphylococcus aureus, and were found in raw milk or milk filter samples from 6 of the 7 farms, but not in other sample types. Pathogenic Listeria species were detected on 3 of the 7 farms, and included 4 L. ivanovii-positive samples, and 1 L. monocytogenes-positive water sample. Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli were identified in fecal samples from 3 of the 7 farms and in a single raw milk sample. Cronobacter species were identified on 4 of the 7 farms, predominantly in feed samples. No Y. enterocolitica was detected. Results of this study demonstrate high standards of pathogen safety across the 7 farms, with a low incidence of pathogens detected in raw milk samples. Monitoring feed contamination levels may help control the spread of bacterial species such as Cl. perfringens and B. cereus through the farm environment, which is a natural reservoir for these organisms.
TI  - Antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties of wines and winery byproducts in relation to their flavonoid content.
AB  - Grapes produce organic compounds that may be involved in the defense of the plants against invading phytopathogens. These metabolites include numerous phenolic compounds that are also active against human pathogens. Grapes are used to produce a variety of wines, grape juices, and raisins. Grape pomace, seeds, and skins, the remains of the grapes that are a byproduct of winemaking, also contain numerous bioactive compounds that differ from those found in grapes and wines. This overview surveys and interprets our present knowledge of the activities of wines and winery byproducts and some of their bioactive components against foodborne (Bacillus cereus, Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterocolitica, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio vulnificus), medical (Helicobacter pylori, Klebsiella pneumoniae), and oral pathogenic bacteria, viruses (adeno, cytomegalo, hepatitis, noro, rota), fungi (Candida albicans, Botrytis cinerea), parasites (Eimeria tenella, Trichomonas vaginalis), and microbial toxins (ochratoxin A, Shiga toxin) in culture, in vivo, and in/on food (beef, chicken, frankfurters, hot dogs, lettuce, oysters, peppers, pork, sausages, soup, spinach) in relation to composition and sensory properties. Also covered are antimicrobial wine marinades, antioxidative and immunostimulating aspects, and adverse effects associated with wine consumption. The collated information and suggested research needs might facilitate and guide further studies needed to optimize the use of wines and byproducts to help improve microbial food safety and prevent or treat animal and human infections.
TI  - Development of 23 individual TaqMan(R) real-time PCR assays for identifying common foodborne pathogens using a single set of amplification conditions.
AB  - Most of the acute intestinal diseases are caused by foodborne pathogens with infants and elderly people being at major risk. The aim of this study was to develop a procedure to simultaneously detect 20 foodborne pathogens in complex alimentary matrices such as milk, cheese and meat. The list of targets include, among the others, Listeria spp., Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Escherichia coli spp., Campylobacter spp., Clostridium spp. and Staphylococcus aureus. The accuracy of detection was determined by using ATCC strains as positive and negative controls. The achieved sensitivity of each of assays was 1 pg of genomic DNA, which was equivalent to approximately 1 cfu. The working ranges of the TaqMan((R)) Real-time PCR assays, when used quantitatively on cheese and meat samples inoculated with serial dilution of Listeria spp., Listeria monocytogenes, S. aureus, Salmonella enterica, Shigella boydii, E. coli O157:H7, Bacillus cereus, Campylobacter coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Enterobacter sakazakii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 10(8) cfu/g to 10(4) cfu/g. No matrix interferences were observed.
TI  - Comparison of MALDI-TOF MS, gene sequencing and the Vitek 2 for identification of seventy-three clinical isolates of enteropathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to evaluate the analytical and practical performance of the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) compared to the sequencing method and the Vitek 2 system for identi fi cation of enteropathogens in the clinical microbiology laboratory. METHODS: Ten type strains and 73 clinical isolates of enteropathogens representing eight genera were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. All isolates were also characterized by gene sequencing allowing interpretation of the results from MALDI-TOF MS. In addition, MALDI-TOF MS was compared with the Vitek 2 system for the identi fi cation of ten isolates of Aeromonas and six of Salmonella. RESULTS: As previously known, identification between Shigella and Escherichia coli is not possible to distinguish. MALDI-TOF MS produced the correct identifications for all other type strains and clinical isolates to the genus level. Fifteen Campylobacter jejuni, six Campylobacter coli, three Plesiomonas shigelloides, three Yersinia enterocolitica, two Clostridium difficile, one Vibrio parahaemolyticus, one Vibrio fluvialis, and one Vibrio cholera were all correctly identi fi ed to the species level. Genus and species identifications of ten Aeromonas and six Salmonella isolates by MALDI-TOF MS were consistent with those by the Vitek 2, but with much less cost and about ten times faster. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that MALDI-TOF MS is a powerful tool for fast, accurate and low-cost identi fi cation of enteropathogens in the clinical microbiology laboratory.
TI  - Use of essential oils and extracts from spices in meat protection.
AB  - The hydro distillation method was used in this study to get essential oils (EOs)  from cumin (Cuminum cyminum L.), clove (Eugenia caryohyllata) and Elecampane (Inula helenium L.) and the co-hydro distillation method (addition of fatty acid ethyl esters as extraction cosolvents) to get functional extracts (EFs). The MIC (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) and the MBC (Minimum Bactericidal Concentration) were determined on five pathogenic strains (Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus and Toxoplasma Gondi). The results showed that essential oils of cumin and clove and their functional extracts are effective on concentrations from 500 mg/L to 750 mg/L. The essential oils with functional extracts were used on meat samples at three different concentrations: 750, 1,500 and 2,250 muL. The cumin essential oil produced a reduction of 3.78 log UFC/g with the application of 750 muL, the clove essential oil produced a reduction of 3.78 log UFC/g with the application of 2,250 muL and the cumin and clove functional extracts got a reduction of 3.6 log UFC/g. By chromatography, eugenol was identified in the clove oil, cuminaldehyde in the cumin oil and the isoalactolactones and alactolactones in the elecampane oil as main compounds on the chemical composition of the essential oils and functional extracts obtained.
TI  - Specific pathogen-free pig herds also free from Campylobacter?
AB  - As Specific Pathogen-Free (SPF) pig herds are designed and managed to prevent specific pig diseases, it might be feasible to expand the list of micro-organisms also including zoonotic pathogens such as Campylobacter coli as this agent has its origin in pigs. In a previous survey, 15 of 16 of SPF herds were found free from human pathogenic Yersinia enterocolitica. Accordingly, three nucleus and seven multiplying herds were surveyed for Campylobacter to investigate whether the Norwegian SPF pig pyramid also might be free from this agent. In conclusion, the intervention of Campylobacter at the herd level might be possible as four of 10 SPF herds tested negative in two sets of samples from both autumn 2008 and summer/early autumn 2010. The four negative herds were all located in remote areas several kilometres away from conventional pig farming while the positive SPF farms were all situated in neighbourhoods with conventional pig production. It seems more difficult to control Campylobacter than some specific animal disease agents and another significant zoonotic agent, Y. enterocolitica, in pig herds.
TI  - Best practices for planning events encouraging human-animal interactions.
AB  - Educational events encouraging human-animal interaction include the risk of zoonotic disease transmission. It is estimated that 14% of all disease in the USA caused by Campylobacter spp., Cryptosporidium spp., Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O157, non-O157 STECs, Listeria monocytogenes, non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica and Yersinia enterocolitica were attributable to animal contact. This article reviews best practices for organizing events where human-animal interactions are encouraged, with the objective of lowering the risk of zoonotic disease transmission.
TI  - A multiplex PCR/LDR assay for simultaneous detection and identification of the NIAID category B bacterial food and water-borne pathogens.
AB  - Enteric pathogens that cause gastroenteritis remain a major global health concern. The goal of this study was to develop a multiplex PCR/ligation detection reaction (LDR) assay for the detection of all NIAID category B bacterial food and water-borne pathogens directly from stool specimens. To validate the PCR/LDR assay, clinical isolates of Campylobacter spp., Vibrio spp., Shigella spp., Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, and diarrheagenic Escherichia coli were tested. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay were assessed using a large number of seeded culture-negative stool specimens and a smaller set of clinical specimens from Haiti. The overall sensitivity ranged from 91% to 100% (median 100%) depending on the species. For the majority of organisms, the sensitivity was 100%. The overall specificity based on initial testing ranged from 98% to 100% depending on the species. After additional testing of discordant samples, the lowest specificity was 99.4%. PCR/LDR detected additional category B agents (particularly diarrheagenic E. coli) in 11/40 specimens from Haiti that were culture-positive for V. cholerae and in approximately 1% of routine culture-negative stool specimens from a hospital in New York. This study demonstrated the ability of the PCR/LDR assay to detect a large comprehensive panel of category B enteric bacterial pathogens as well as mixed infections. This type of assay has the potential to provide earlier warnings of possible public health threats and more accurate surveillance of food and water-borne pathogens.
TI  - Evaluation of a multiplex PCR assay for simultaneous detection of bacterial and viral enteropathogens in stool samples of paediatric patients.
AB  - We evaluated a multiplex PCR assay, the Seeplex Diarrhoea ACE detection, that simultaneously detects 15 enteric pathogens, including Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Vibrio spp., toxin B producer Clostridium difficile, Campylobacter spp., Clostridium perfringens, Yersinia enterocolitica, Aeromonas spp., Escherichia coli O157:H7, verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli, adenovirus, Group A rotavirus, norovirus GI and GII, and astrovirus. We compared this assay with clinical methods routinely used in our laboratory, for detecting enteropathogens in stool samples collected from 245 paediatric patients with suspected infectious gastroenteritis. We recovered 61 bacterial pathogens and 121 enteric viruses with our laboratory assays, while we detected 78 bacteria and 167 viruses with the molecular assay. We calculated specificity and sensitivity for both methods after analysis of discordant results and demonstrated greater sensitivity for multiplex PCR than for our routine methods, with the exception of Salmonella spp. and toxigenic C. difficile detection. The multiplex PCR assay proved to be a reliable tool to directly detect the most common enteropathogens in stool samples but with some limitations.
TI  - Disease-outcome trees, EQ-5D scores, and estimated annual losses of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for 14 foodborne pathogens in the United States.
AB  - Measures of disease burden such as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) are increasingly important to risk-based food safety policy. They provide a means of comparing relative risk from diverse health outcomes. We present detailed disease-outcome trees and EQ-5D scoring for 14 major foodborne pathogens representing over 95% of foodborne illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths due to specified agents in the United States (Campylobacter spp., Clostridium perfringens, Cryptosporidium parvum, Cyclospora cayetanensis, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli non-O157, Listeria monocytogenes, nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica, Shigella, Toxoplasma gondii, Vibrio vulnificus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus and other noncholera Vibrio, and Yersinia enterocolitica). We estimate over 5800 QALYs lost per 1000 cases of L. monocytogenes and V. vulnificus, compared to 125 QALYs lost per 1000 cases of T. gondii, 26 for E. coli O157:H7, 16 for Salmonella and Campylobacter, and 14 for Y. enterocolitica. The remaining 7 pathogens are estimated to cause less than 5 QALYs lost per 1000 cases. In total, these 14 pathogens cause over 61,000 in QALY loss annually, with more than 90% due solely to acute infection being responsible for 65% of total QALY loss, with premature mortality and morbidity due to chronic and congenital illness responsible for another 28%. These estimates of the burden of chronic sequelae are likely conservative; additional epidemiological research is needed to support more accurate burden estimates. This study shows the value of using integrated metrics for comparing disease burden, and the need to consider chronic and congenital illness when prioritizing foodborne pathogens.
TI  - Food-borne pathogens of animal origin-diagnosis, prevention, control and their zoonotic significance: a review.
AB  - The term food borne diseases or food-borne illnesses or more commonly food poisoning are used to denote gastrointestinal complications that occur following recent consumption of a particular food or drink. Millions of people suffer worldwide every year and the situation is quiet grave in developing nations creating social and economic strain. The food borne pathogens include various bacteria viz., Salmonella, Campylobacter, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, Staphylococcus, Arcobacter, Clostridium perfringens, Cl. botulinum and Bacillus cereus and helminths viz., Taenia. They also include protozoa viz., Trichinella, Sarcocystis, Toxoplasma gondii and Cryptosporidium parvum. The zoonotic potential and the ability to elaborate toxins by many of the microbes causing fatal intoxication are sufficient to understand the seriousness of the situation. The viral agents being host specific their transmission to humans through food of animal origin is not yet confirmed although these animal viruses are similar to that of viruses infecting human. Food-borne bacteria; protozoa and helminthes have complex distribution pattern in the environment and inside the host system. This along with complexity of the maintenance chain and life cycle (of parasites) has made it difficult for epidemiologist and diagnostician to undertake any immediate safety measures against them. Serological and molecular diagnostic tests viz. ELISA, Latex agglutination test, Lateral flow assays, Immunomagnetic separation assays, molecular assays viz. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), multiplex PCR, immuno-PCR, Realtime PCR, Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR, DNA microarrays and probes are widely used. Along with these LAMP assays, Capillary Electrophoresis-Single Strand Confirmation polymorphism (CE-SSCP); Flow cytometry, FISH, Biosensors, Direct epifluorescent filter technique, nanotechnology based methods and sophisticated tools (ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging and chlonangio-pancreatography) have aided in the diagnosis greatly. Most of the food-borne illnesses are self-limiting but in many instances antibiotics are recommended. With the increased drug resistance however use of chicken immunoglobulin, bacteriophage therapy, probiotics and herbs are gaining much importance these days. Adoption of proper prevention and control measures (including cooking procedures; hygiene, strict adherence to HACCP principles, public awareness and disease surveillance and monitoring) are the need of hour. All these have been discussed vividly in this review to help epidemiologists, diagnosticians, clinicians and above all common people so as to enable them avoid negligence regarding such serious issue.
TI  - Added value of multiplex Luminex Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (xTAG(R) GPP) testing in the diagnosis of infectious gastroenteritis.
AB  - The Luminex Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (xTAG((R)) GPP) detects in one assay  the most common gastroenteritis-causing pathogens and toxins, namely adenovirus 40/41, norovirus genogroup (NG) I/II, rotavirus A, Clostridium difficile toxin A/B, Campylobacter sp., Escherichia coli O157, Enterotoxigenic E. coli heat-labile enterotoxin/heat-stable enterotoxin, Salmonella sp., Shiga-toxin producing E. coli, Shiga-like toxin (Stx)1/2, Shigella sp., Vibrio cholerae, Yersinia enterocolitica, Cryptosporidium sp., Entamoeba histolytica and Giardia sp. In this study, we compared the results that were obtained by testing 393 faecal samples, collected during November and December 2011 at our laboratory, using the xTAG((R)) GPP assay with the results of the routine diagnostic procedure. This procedure includes culture for bacteria and real-time PCR for viruses and parasites, but only if the test was requested by the clinician. If the clinician did not request the test for an xTAG((R)) GPP-positive target, real-time PCR assays were used to confirm xTAG((R)) GPP positivity. Discrepant results were also tested with real-time PCR assays. A total of 83 targets were detected in 76 samples using xTAG((R)) GPP. The xTAG((R)) GPP assay detected 43 additional positives compared with the routine diagnostic procedure, of which 11 targets could not be confirmed by real-time PCR. The non-confirmed targets were Campylobacter (one sample), Salmonella (four samples), Shigella (one sample) and E. histolytica (five samples). The xTAG((R)) GPP was shown to be a convenient and sensitive assay for detection of 15 major gastrointestinal pathogens in a single molecular test, but for detection of E. histolytica and Salmonella, a confirmatory assay is indicated.
TI  - [Infectious etiology of acute idiopathic intussusception in children].
AB  - The intussusception (IIA) is an invagination of the immediate part of the intestine. She is responsible for a syndrome with an occlusive venous compression and swelling that can rapidly progress to intestinal necrosis. Most cases occur in children aged 6 to 18 months and occur more frequently in boys than girls. There are two types of IIA: the IIA idiopathic representing 90-95% of invaginations of the child and the IIA secondary to local injury of the gastrointestinal tract or occurring in a particular context whose frequency are between 5 and 10%. The pathogenesis of the IIA remains uncertain, but the infectious origin is criminalized in most idiopathic invaginations. This component is dominated by viral agents including adenovirus, rotavirus, enterovirus, human herpesvirus 6 and 7, cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barrvirus. Bacterial agents are rather found and include Yersinia enterocolitica, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli O157, H7, Salmonella and Campylobacter. In a small proportion parasitic agents may be reported in the IIA, the most frequently found are Entamoeba histolytica, Trichuris trichuira, Ascaris lumbricoides, Ankylostoma and Giardia.
TI  - Evaluation of Luminex xTAG gastrointestinal pathogen analyte-specific reagents for high-throughput, simultaneous detection of bacteria, viruses, and parasites of clinical and public health importance.
AB  - Acute diarrheal disease (ADD) can be caused by a range of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites. Conventional diagnostic methods, such as culture, microscopy, biochemical assays, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), are laborious and time-consuming and lack sensitivity. Combined, the array of tests performed on a single specimen can increase the turnaround time (TAT) significantly. We validated a 19plex laboratory-developed gastrointestinal pathogen panel (GPP) using Luminex xTAG analyte-specific reagents (ASRs) to simultaneously screen directly in fecal specimens for diarrhea-causing pathogens, including bacteria (Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli [ETEC], Shiga toxin-producing E. coli [STEC], E. coli O157:H7, Vibrio cholerae, Yersinia enterocolitica, and toxigenic Clostridium difficile), parasites (Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium spp., and Entamoeba histolytica), and viruses (norovirus GI and GII, adenovirus 40/41, and rotavirus A). Performance characteristics of GPP ASRs were determined using 48 reference isolates and 254 clinical specimens. Stool specimens from individuals with diarrhea were tested for pathogens using conventional and molecular methods. Using the predictive methods as standards, the sensitivities of the GPP ASRs were 100% for adenovirus 40/41, norovirus, rotavirus A, Vibrio cholerae, Yersinia enterocolitica, Entamoeba histolytica, Cryptosporidium spp., and E. coli O157:H7; 95% for Giardia lamblia; 94% for ETEC and STEC; 93% for Shigella spp.; 92% for Salmonella spp.; 91% for C. difficile A/B toxins; and 90% for Campylobacter jejuni. The overall comparative performance of the GPP ASRs with conventional methods in clinical samples was 94.5% (range, 90% to 97%), with 99% (99.0% to 99.9%) specificity. Implementation of the GPP ASRs enables our public health laboratory to offer highly sensitive and specific screening and identification of the major ADD-causing pathogens.
TI  - Drinking water for dairy cattle: always a benefit or a microbiological risk?
AB  - Drinking water can be considered an essential nutrient for dairy cattle. However, because it comes from different sources, its chemical and microbiological quality does not always reach accepted standards. Moreover, water quality is not routinely assessed on dairy farms. The microecology of drinking water sources and distribution systems is rather complex and still not fully understood. Water quality is adversely affected by the formation of biofilms in distribution systems, which form a persistent reservoir for potentially pathogenic bacteria. Saprophytic microorganisms associated with such biofilms interact with organic and inorganic matter in water, with pathogens, and even with each other. In addition, the presence of biofilms in water distribution systems makes cleaning and disinfection difficult and sometimes impossible. This article describes the complex dynamics of microorganisms in water distribution systems. Water quality is diminished primarily as a result of faecal contamination and rarely as a result of putrefaction in water distribution systems. The design of such systems (with/ without anti-backflow valves and pressure) and the materials used (polyethylene enhances biofilm; stainless steel does not) affect the quality of water they provide. The best option is an open, funnel-shaped galvanized drinking trough, possibly with a pressure system, air inlet, and anti-backflow valves. A poor microbiological quality of drinking water may adversely affect feed intake, and herd health and productivity. In turn, public health may be affected because cattle can become a reservoir of microorganisms hazardous to humans, such as some strains of E. coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Campylobacter jejuni. A better understanding of the biological processes in water sources and distribution systems and of the viability of microorganisms in these systems may contribute to better advice on herd health and productivity at a farm level. Certain on-farm risk factors for water quality have been identified. A practical approach will facilitate the control and management of these risks, and thereby improve herd health and productivity.
TI  - Pathogenic bacteria in Finnish bulk tank milk.
AB  - While the quality of raw cow milk in Finland is known for its high hygienic standard, with the national average total bacterial count being below 10(4) CFU/mL annually, the prevalence of pathogenic bacteria in Finnish raw milk is underreported. The aim of this study was to determine the occurrence of Listeria monocytogenes, thermophilic Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp., stx-positive Escherichia coli (STEC), coagulase-positive staphylococci, Yersinia spp., and Bacillus cereus group in raw cow milk samples collected from bulk tanks at 183 Finnish farms. Additionally, the hygienic quality of the milk was studied by determining the total bacterial and E. coli counts. L. monocytogenes was detected in 5.5% of the milk samples, with concentrations varying from <1 to 30 CFU/mL. Thermophilic Campylobacter spp. or Salmonella spp. were not detected in any of the samples. STEC with Shiga toxin-encoding stx2 was detected in 2.7% of the samples. Yersinia enterocolitica was detected in 7.7% of the samples; however, all isolates were negative for ail, suggesting that they were non-pathogenic. Coagulase-positive staphylococci were detected in 34.4% of the samples, with an average concentration of 25 CFU/mL in the positive samples. Members of the B. cereus group were detected in 20.8% of the samples, with an average concentration of 1 CFU/mL in the positive samples. No relationship was detected between E. coli or the total bacterial count and the presence of pathogenic bacteria, which suggests that pathogens can be present also in farms with excellent production hygiene. Although the concentration of pathogenic bacteria in fresh raw milk was mainly relatively low, it should be borne in mind that some of the pathogenic bacteria can survive and multiply at refrigeration temperatures and may cause a disease with a very low infectious dose. Thus, consumption of raw milk and related products poses a potential risk for food poisoning.
TI  - Estimates of illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths caused by major bacterial enteric pathogens in young children in the United States.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many enteric pathogens disproportionately affect young children. However, higher incidences of laboratory-confirmed illness may be explained, at least in part, by higher rates of medical care-seeking and stool sample submission in this age group. We estimated the overall number of bacterial enteric illnesses among children <5 years old in the United States caused by Campylobacter, Escherichia coli O157, nontyphoidal Salmonella, Shigella and Yersinia enterocolitica. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a statistical model that scaled counts of laboratory-confirmed illnesses from the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network up to an estimated number of illnesses in the United States, adjusting for the surveillance steps needed for an illness to be laboratory diagnosed (medical care sought, stool sample submitted, bacterial culture performed, laboratory tested for pathogen, laboratory test sensitivity). RESULTS: We estimated that 5 bacterial enteric pathogens caused 291,162 illnesses each year among children <5 years old, resulting in 102,746 physician visits, 7830 hospitalizations and 64 deaths. Nontyphoidal Salmonella caused most illnesses (42%), followed by Campylobacter (28%), Shigella (21%), Y. enterocolitica (5%) and E. coli O157 (3%). The estimated annual number of physician visits ranged from 3763 for E. coli O157 to 44,369 for nontyphoidal Salmonella. Nontyphoidal Salmonella was estimated to cause most hospitalizations (4670) and deaths (38). CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial enteric infections cause many illnesses in US children. Compared with the general population, enteric illnesses among children <5 years old are more likely to be diagnosed. However, overall rates of illness remain higher in children after adjusting for underdiagnosis in both groups.
TI  - Rapid detection and respirometric profiling of aerobic bacteria on panels of selective media.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate high-throughput optical oxygen microrespirometry for selective  detection and predictive identification of aerobic bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using GreenLight probe, standard 384-well plates and time-resolved fluorescence reader, a representative panel of 16 partially selective media and 9 aerobic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pyogenes, Salmonella typhimurium and Listeria innocua) were analysed. For each medium, bacterial strain and dilution, growth profiles were recorded, from which calibrations, doubling/generation times and growth patterns in different media were determined. Analytical performance, selectivity and general usability of the method were assessed, and mixed bacterial cultures were analysed. CONCLUSION: The microrespirometry platform facilitates simple, real-time detection and predictive identification of aerobic bacteria by looking at the patterns of their growth and respiration in several media and determining their growth and doubling times. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The new screening method can be used for routine microbiological analysis and testing of aerobic bacterial cultures as well as complex food, environmental and clinical samples.
TI  - Effects of lactic acid and commercial chilling processes on survival of Salmonella, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Campylobacter coli in pork variety meats.
AB  - Current industry chilling practices with and without the application of 2% L-lactic acid were compared for their effectiveness at reducing levels of Salmonella, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Campylobacter coli on pork variety meats. Pork variety meats (livers, intestines, hearts, and stomachs) were inoculated individually with one of the three pathogens and subjected to five different treatment combinations that included one or more of the following: water wash (25 degrees C), lactic acid spray (2%, 40 to 50 degrees C), chilling (4 degrees C), and freezing (-15 degrees C). Samples were analyzed before treatment, after each treatment step, and after 2, 4, and 6 months of frozen storage. Results showed that when a lactic acid spray was used in combination with water spray, immediate reductions were approximately 0.5 log CFU per sample of Salmonella, 0.8 log CFU per sample of Y. enterocolitica, and 1.1 log CFU per sample of C. coli. Chilling, both alone and in combination with spray treatments, had little effect on pathogens, while freezing resulted in additional 0.5-log CFU per sample reductions in levels of Salmonella and Y. enterocolitica, and an additional 1.0-log CFU per sample reduction in levels of C. coli. While reductions of at least 1 log CFU per sample were observed on variety meats treated with only a water wash and subsequently frozen, samples treated with lactic acid had greater additional reductions than those treated with only a water spray throughout frozen storage. The results of this study suggest that the use of lactic acid as a decontamination intervention, when used in combination with good manufacturing practices during processing, causes significant reductions in levels of Salmonella, Y. enterocolitica, and C. coli on pork variety meats.
TI  - Estimates of enteric illness attributable to contact with animals and their environments in the United States.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Contact with animals and their environment is an important, and often preventable, route of transmission for enteric pathogens. This study estimated the annual burden of illness attributable to animal contact for 7 groups of pathogens: Campylobacter species, Cryptosporidium species, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O157, STEC non-O157, Listeria monocytogenes, nontyphoidal Salmonella species, and Yersinia enterocolitica. METHODS: By using data from the US Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network and other sources, we estimated the proportion of illnesses attributable to animal contact for each pathogen and applied those proportions to the estimated annual number of illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths among US residents. We established credible intervals (CrIs) for each estimate. RESULTS: We estimated that 14% of all illnesses caused by these 7 groups of pathogens were attributable to animal contact. This estimate translates to 445 213 (90% CrI, 234 197-774 839) illnesses annually for the 7 groups combined. Campylobacter species caused an estimated 187 481 illnesses annually (90% CrI, 66 259-372 359), followed by nontyphoidal Salmonella species (127 155; 90% CrI, 66 502-219 886) and Cryptosporidium species (113 344; 90% CrI, 22 570-299 243). Of an estimated 4933 hospitalizations (90% CrI, 2704-7914), the majority were attributable to nontyphoidal Salmonella (48%), Campylobacter (38%), and Cryptosporidium (8%) species. Nontyphoidal Salmonella (62%), Campylobacter (22%), and Cryptosporidium (9%) were also responsible for the majority of the estimated 76 deaths (90% CrI, 5-211). CONCLUSIONS: Animal contact is an important transmission route for multiple major enteric pathogens. Continued efforts are needed to prevent pathogen transmission from animals to humans, including increasing awareness and encouraging hand hygiene.
TI  - The patient presenting with acute dysentery--a systematic review.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The etiologies, clinical presentations and diagnosis of acute pathogen-specific dysentery in children and adults in industrialized and developing regions is described to help develop recommendations for therapy. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of literature published between January 2000 and June 2011 to determine the frequency of occurrence of pathogen-specific dysentery. RESULTS: Shigella, Salmonella, and Campylobacter remain the most frequent bacterial causes of dysentery worldwide. Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) is potentially important in industrialized countries. Entamoeba histolytica must be considered in the developing world, particularly in rural or periurban areas. Clinicians should use epidemiological clues and knowledge of endemicity to suspect Vibrio spp., Aeromonas spp., Plesiomonas spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Clostridium difficile, Cytomegalovirus or Schistosoma mansoni in cases presenting with dysentery. A single fecal sample studied for etiologic agents is the customary way to make an etiologic diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: While a majority of dysenteric cases will not have an identifiable agent causing the illness, when an etiologic organism is identified, other than STEC, each has a specific recommended form of therapy, which is provided in this review.
TI  - Long-term trends in the epidemiology and resistance of childhood bacterial enteropathogens in Crete.
AB  - In this study, we investigated the long-term trends in the epidemiology and susceptibility of bacterial enteropathogens among children in a well-defined area of adequate health standards. The study included all children younger than 14 years of age treated for enteritis at Heraklion University General Hospital on the island of Crete during the 18-year period from January 1993 to December 2010. Stool specimens were tested for Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), Yersinia, and Aeromonas species. Of the 33,032 stool samples from patients of any age, 2,912 (8.82%) were positive for bacterial enteropathogens. The 1,597 isolates from children were identified as S. enterica (42.3%), Campylobacter spp. (33.6%), EPEC (17.4%), Y. enterocolitica (5.82%), A. hydrophila (0.44%), and Shigella spp. (0.38%). A decline in prevalence was observed for all bacterial enteropathogens. Taken as a total, enteropathogens were susceptible to gentamicin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, co-trimoxazole, and amoxicillin in 98.8%, 88.0%, 83.0%, 67.1%, and 59.6%, respectively. During the study period, the susceptibility rates decreased for co-trimoxazole (p<0.0001) and ciprofloxacin (p<0.001), and increased for amoxicillin (p<0.0001). Our findings suggest declining long-term trends in the prevalence of bacterial enteropathogens and changes in susceptibility rates to first-line antibacterial agents. These changing trends in the long-term morbidity and susceptibility call for ongoing surveillance and tailored management.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin S760 produced by Enterococcus faecium strain LWP760].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin S760 (enterocin) produced by Enterococcusfaecium strain LWP760 was studied. Bacteriocin S760 is a cationic, hydrophobic, and heat stable peptide with the molecular weight of 5.5 kDa and pl of 9.8. Enterocin S760 is shown to inhibit in vitro the growth both of sensitive and resistant to antibacterials gramnegative and grampositive bacteria of 25 species. MICs of the bacteriocin S760 vary between 0.05-1.6 mg/l for Escherichia coli 0157:H117, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritidis, Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens, that are main food-borne pathogens, and from 0.4-1.6 mg/l for Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Corynebacterium diphteriae. It is also active against antibioticresistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter baumannii (with MICs of 0.05-3 mg/l), Klebsiella pneumoniae (with MICs of 6 mg/l), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MICs of 0.4-25 mg/1), as well against fungi belonging to species of Candida albicans, Candida krusei and Aspergillus niger (with MICs of 0.1-0.2 mg/l). Enterocin S760 is a novel antimicrobial agents useful in medicine, veterinary and food industry.
TI  - Hygienic quality and antibiotic resistance profile of sliced butchery.
AB  - In order to investigate the microbiological quality of different meat products on the Greek market, 200 samples were collected from the following preparations: boiled turkey (n=50), boiled pork ham (n=50), smoked turkey (n=50) and smoked pork ham (n=50). In all cold meat preparations Clostridium perfringens vegetative and spore forms, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and other Clostridium sp lec(-), as well as Lactobacillus, Bacillus sp. and Salmonella sp. were recovered. For instance Bacillus cereus was present in 6% of the samples. L. monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli were rarely present (1-4%) while Yersinia enterocolitica and Campylobacter lari were absent. Differences in the occurrence of S. aureus, Salmonella sp., E. coli and spore forms of C. perfringens in boiled and smoked samples, reflects either the differences in the processing of the foods or could be associated to the extensive handling by the personnel during the purchasing (storage, slicing, wrapping). Antibiotic resistance on specific antibiotics for each pathogen was also studied. A multiresistance antibiotic profile was effective for most bacterial strains, and pronounced resistance profiles were observed for the commonly used antibiotics as ampicillin, penicillin, cephalothin, streptomycin followed by ceftriaxone and gentamycin. Albeit this high observed resistance profile, the tested strains generally conserved their susceptibility to amikacin, aztreonam, chloramphenicol and tylosin conserved an almost absent resistance. Antibiotics commonly used for therapeutic purposes, as well as antibiotics added to feed stuff of animals for increasing animal flesh production should contribute to the extensive spreading of antibiotic resistance in food and the environment. Systematically monitoring of the microbiological quality of cold butchery preparations must be done, in order to preserve food quality, optimizing the processing and elaboration methods of the product and safeguard the public health.
TI  - Food-specific attribution of selected gastrointestinal illnesses: estimates from  a Canadian expert elicitation survey.
AB  - The study used a structured expert elicitation survey to derive estimates of food-specific attribution for nine illnesses caused by enteric pathogens in Canada. It was based on a similar survey conducted in the United States and focused on Campylobacter spp., Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica, Shigella spp., Vibrio spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Cryptosporidium parvum, and Norwalk-like virus. A snowball approach was used to identify food safety experts within Canada. Survey respondents provided background information as well as self-assessments of their expertise for each pathogen and the 12 food categories. Depending on the pathogen, food source attribution estimates were based on responses from between 10 and 35 experts. For each pathogen, experts divided their estimates of total foodborne illness across 12 food categories and they provided a best estimate for each category as well as 5th and 95th percentile limits for foods considered to be vehicles. Their responses were treated as triangular probability distributions, and linear aggregation was used to combine the opinions of each group of experts for each pathogen-food source group. Across the 108 pathogen-food groups, a majority of experts agreed on 30 sources and 48 nonsources for illness. The number of food groups considered to be pathogen sources by a majority of experts varied by pathogen from a low of one food source for Vibrio spp. (seafood) and C. parvum (produce) to a high of seven food sources for Salmonella spp. Beta distributions were fitted to the aggregated opinions and were reasonable representations for most of the pathogen-food group attributions. These results will be used to quantitatively assess the burden of foodborne illness in Canada as well as to analyze the uncertainty in our estimates.
TI  - Microbiological quality of blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) in Nunavik, Quebec: a pilot study.
AB  - This pilot study was aimed at documenting the presence of fecal indicators and enteric pathogens in blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) from 6 communities in Nunavik, Quebec. One to four 2 kg samples of mussels were collected at low tide in each community. Samples were investigated by enumeration methods for the fecal indicators enterococci, Escherichia coli, F-specific coliphages, Clostridium perfringens, and by molecular identification for the pathogens norovirus, Salmonella spp., Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli, and Campylobacter lari, verocytotoxin-producing E. coli (particularly serovar O157:H7), Shigella spp., and Yersinia enterocolitica. In 5 communities, the presence of Giardia duodenalis and Cryptosporidium spp. was also tested by microscopy and molecular methods and that of Toxoplasma gondii was tested by molecular methods. Apart from small quantities of Clostridium perfringens in 2 samples, no bacterial or viral pathogens were detected in the mussels. Toxoplasma gondii was also not detected. However, G. duodenalis and Cryptosporidium spp. were present in 18% and 73% of the samples investigated for these pathogens, respectively. When considering the indicators and the viral and bacterial pathogens investigated, the mussels examined were of good microbiological quality, but considering the presence of potentially zoonotic protozoa, it should be recommended that consumers cook the molluscs well before eating them.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance of major foodborne pathogens from major meat products.
AB  - The bacterial contamination of raw and processed meat products with resistant pathogens was studied. The raw samples included sheep (40), goat (40), pork (120), beef (80), and chicken (19) meat, and the processed samples included turkey filets (33), salami (8), readymade mincemeat (16), stuffing (22), and roast-beef (50). The samples were collected from retail shops in Northwestern Greece over a period of 3 years. The isolated pathogens were evaluated for susceptibilities to 19 antimicrobial agents used in humans. Out of 428 samples, 157 strains of Escherichia coli, 25 of Yersinia enterocolitica, 57 of Staphylococcus aureus, 57 of Enterococcus spp., 4 of Salmonella spp., and 3 of Campylobacter jejuni were isolated. Among the isolates 14.6% of the E. coli, 10.5% of S. aureus, 4% of Y. enterocolitica, 25% of Salmonella spp., and 42.1% of Enterococcus spp. were susceptible to antibiotics. E. coli from chicken exhibited high rates of resistance to ciprofloxacin (62.5%) followed by lamb/goat (10.9%), pork (15.7%), and beef (27.9%) meat. Resistance to nitrofurantoin dominated in the lamb/goat isolates (60%). Resistance to tetracycline predominated in pork (68.2%) and chicken (62.5%), and resistance to aminoglycosides dominated in lamb/goat meat isolates. S. aureus resistance to clindamycin predominated in lamb/goat isolates (50%), whereas resistance to ciprofloxacin predominated in the pork strains, but no resistance to methicillin was observed. Of the enterococci isolates 21.1% were resistant to vancomycin. High resistance to ampicillin (96%) was observed in Y. enterocolitica and all of the C. jejuni isolates were resistant to ampicillin, cephalothin, and cefuroxime. These results indicate that meat can be a source of resistant bacteria, which could potentially be spread to the community through the food chain.
TI  - Human pathogens and tetracycline-resistant bacteria in bioaerosols of swine confinement buildings and in nasal flora of hog producers.
AB  - Swine confinement buildings in eastern Canada are enclosed and equipped with modern production systems to manage waste. Bioaerosols of these swine confinement buildings could be contaminated by human pathogens and antimicrobial resistant bacteria which could colonize exposed workers. We therefore wanted to analyze bioaerosols of swine confinement buildings and nasal flora of Canadian hog producers to evaluate possible colonization with human pathogens and tetracycline-resistant bacteria. Culturable and non-culturable human pathogens and tet genes were investigated in the bioaerosols of 18 barns. The nasal passages of 35 hog producers were sampled and total DNA was extracted from the calcium-alginate swabs to detect, by PCR, Campylobacter, C. perfringens, Enterococcus, E. coli, Y. enterocolitica, tetA/tetC, tetG and ribosomal protection protein genes. Airborne culturable C. perfringens, Enterococcus, E. coli, and Y. enterocolitica were present in the bioaerosols of 16, 17, 11 and 6 of the 18 facilities. Aerosolized total (culturable/non culturable) Campylobacter, C. perfringens, Enterococcus, E. coli and Y. enterocolitica were detected in 10, 6, 15, 18 and 2 barns, respectively. Tet genes were found in isolates of culturable human pathogens. TetA/tetC, tetG and ribosomal protection protein genes were detected in the bioaerosols of all 18 studied buildings. Campylobacter, C. perfringens, Enterococcus, E. coli, and Y. enterocolitica were found respectively in 4, 9, 17, 14 and one nasal flora of workers. One and 10 workers were positive for tetA/tetC and tetG genes, respectively. In swine confinement buildings, hog producers are exposed to aerosolized human pathogens and tetracycline-resistant bacteria that can contaminate the nasal flora.
TI  - Bacterial enteropathogens and risk factors associated with childhood diarrhea.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the etiology of bacterial enteropathogens causing diarrhea among children; to elucidate the risk factors, sign and symptoms involved in developing of infection; and to identify the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern. METHODS: Stool samples from diarrheal cases with clinical diagnosis of gastroenteritis compared to matched controls, were examined for detection of bacterial enteropathogens by conventional cultural method from February 2006 through January 2007. RESULTS: Ninety three of diarrheal cases comprising enteropathogen isolates. A recognized bacterial enteric pathogen was identified in 31% of the cases and 8% of the control group. The frequency of isolated enteropathogens from faeces of diarrheal cases was recorded in the following order, Enterohemorrhagic E. coli 8.3%, Shigella spp. 6.7%, Campylobacter jejuni 5%, Salmonella spp. 4%, Yersinia enterocolitica 2.7%, Aeromonas spp. 4.7%, and Plesiomonas spp. 1.3%. E.H.E coli, Shigella and Salmonella had shown a significant statistical association with diarrhea (p<0.05). Compared to matched uninfected control, multivariate analysis revealed that malnutrition status (OR adjusted 8.37; p<0.001) was the only independent factor associated with infection. Antibiotic susceptibility profile indicated that enteropathogens were generally susceptible to meropenem, ceftriaxone, followed by amikacin and ciprofloxacin. Almost all enteropathogens were resistant to ampicillin and amoxicillin. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study emphasize the importance of bacterial enteropathogens in causing severe diarrhea in children. E.H.E. coli was the most predominant pathogen. Malnutrition was identified as the main independent risk factor associated with developing of infection. Ampicillin and amoxicillin should not be used as empirical treatment in acute diarrhea.
TI  - Mass spectrometry biotyper system identifies enteric bacterial pathogens directly from colonies grown on selective stool culture media.
AB  - We evaluated the performance and cost-effectiveness of a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry-based Biotyper system for the routine identification of common enteric bacterial pathogens seen in middle Tennessee from suspicious colonies grown on selective stool culture media. A total of 304 suspicious colonies were selected and further identified from 605 stool specimens. The suspicious colonies were analyzed by the Biotyper system, and the results were compared to those from routine phenotypic methods, which identified 22 Salmonella species, 39 Shigella species, 3 enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) isolates, 2 Yersinia enterocolitica isolates, 2 Campylobacter species, and 236 gastrointestinal normal flora isolates. The Biotyper system correctly identified the Salmonella species, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Campylobacter species but failed to distinguish the Shigella species and EHEC isolates from E. coli. Among the 236 normal flora isolates, 233 (98.7%) and 228 (96.6%) agreed at the genus and species levels, respectively, between the phenotypic and Biotyper methods. Organism identification scores were insignificantly different between colonies directly from selective media and subsequently from pure subculture. The entire Biotyper identification procedure, from smear preparation to final result reporting, can be completed within 30 min. The Biotyper system provides a rapid and simple screening tool for identifying many, but not all, suspicious colonies grown on selective media within 24 h after inoculation, which shortens test turnaround time by 2 to 3 days.
TI  - Foodborne proportion of gastrointestinal illness: estimates from a Canadian expert elicitation survey.
AB  - The study used a structured expert elicitation survey to derive estimates of the  foodborne attributable proportion for nine illnesses caused by enteric pathogens in Canada. It was based on a similar study conducted in the United States and focused on Campylobacter, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica, Shigella spp., Vibrio spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Cryptosporidium parvum, and Norwalk-like virus. For each pathogen, experts were asked to provide their best estimate and low and high limits for the proportion of foodborne illness relative to total cases. In addition, they provided background information with regard to food safety experience, including self-evaluated expertise for each pathogen on a 5-point scale. A snowball approach was used to identify 152 experts within Canada. The experts' background details were summarized using descriptive statistics. Factor analysis was used to determine whether the variability in best estimates was related to self-assessed level of expertise or other background information. Cluster analysis followed by beta function fitting was undertaken on best estimates from experts who self-evaluated their expertise 3 or higher. In parallel, Monte Carlo resampling was run using triangular distributions based on each expert's best estimate and its limits. Sixty-six experts encompassing various academic backgrounds, fields of expertise, and experiences relevant to food safety provided usable data. Considerable variation between experts in their estimated foodborne attributable proportions was observed over all diseases, without any relationship to the expert's background. Uncertainty about their estimate (measured by the low and high limits) varied between experts and between pathogens as well. Both cluster analysis and Monte Carlo resampling clearly indicated disagreement between experts for Campylobacter, E. coli O157, L. monocytogenes, Salmonella, Vibrio, and Y. enterocolitica. In the absence of more reliable estimates, the observed discrepancy between experts must be explored and understood before one can judge which opinion is the best.
TI  - High bacterial contamination of pig tonsils at slaughter.
AB  - Food-borne zoonoses have a major health impact in industrial countries. Campylobacter spp., Salmonella enterica, Yersinia enterocolitica and Listeria monocytogenes are high-risk food-borne zoonotic hazards in finishing pigs. The objectives of this work were (1) to study the isolation rate of pathogenic Y. enterocolitica, Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp. and L. monocytogenes in the tonsils and feces and (2) to determine the number of mesophilic aerobic bacteria (MAB) and Escherichia coli in the tonsils of fattening pigs at slaughter. The samples, which were collected from one slaughterhouse on five occasions, originated from 50 pigs and 15 farms. The number of MAB varied from 6.40 to 7.82 log(10) CFU/g and E. coli from 4.38 to 6.53 log(10) CFU/g. Additionally, 31 (62%) of the tonsils were colonized with Y. enterocolitica and 16 (32%) with L. monocytogenes. Campylobacter spp. were more frequently excreted in feces and only 3 (6%) of the pigs carried Campylobacter spp. in the tonsils. No Salmonella spp. were isolated. The pig tonsils were shown to be colonized with a high number of bacteria including E. coli, which is the most important indicator for fecal contamination, and with Y. enterocolitica and L. monocytogenes, which are important food-borne pathogens. This study demonstrates that the tonsils are highly contaminated with micro-organisms and can be a very important source of contamination in the slaughterhouse.
TI  - Amino-terminal residues dictate the export efficiency of the Campylobacter jejuni filament proteins via the flagellum.
AB  - Bacterial flagella play an essential role in the pathogenesis of numerous enteric pathogens. The flagellum is required for motility, colonization, and in some instances, for the secretion of effector proteins. In contrast to the intensively studied flagella of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium, the flagella of Campylobacter jejuni, Helicobacter pylori and Vibrio cholerae are less well characterized and composed of multiple flagellin subunits. This study was performed to gain a better understanding of flagellin export from the flagellar type III secretion apparatus of C. jejuni. The flagellar filament of C. jejuni is comprised of two flagellins termed FlaA and FlaB. We demonstrate that the amino-termini of FlaA and FlaB determine the length of the flagellum and motility of C. jejuni. We also demonstrate that protein-specific residues in the amino-terminus of FlaA and FlaB dictate export efficiency from the flagellar type III secretion system (T3SS) of Yersinia enterocolitica. These findings demonstrate that key residues within the amino-termini of two nearly identical proteins influence protein export efficiency, and that the mechanism governing the efficiency of protein export is conserved among two pathogens belonging to distinct bacterial classes. These findings are of additional interest because C. jejuni utilizes the flagellum to export virulence proteins.
TI  - Bacterial enteritis as a risk factor for childhood intussusception: a retrospective cohort study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between bacterial enteritis and intussusception. STUDY DESIGN: The Patient Administration Systems and Biostatistics Activity database from January 2002 to December 2005 was examined for clinic visits or hospital admission to a Department of Defense medical facility for children age 0-5 years. The study included the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems diagnosis-related group (DRG) codes for infections with Yersinia enterocolitica, Escherichia coli, Shigella species, Salmonella species, and Campylobacter. Identified patients were then assessed for the intussusception DRG code for 0-180 days postinfection. The total number of children enrolled in military treatment facilities in the same age group (denominator) was obtained. RESULTS: Bacterial enteritis significantly increased the relative risk of intussusception. An increased risk was found following infection with Salmonella, E coli, Shigella, and Campylobacter. The relative risk for intussusception following any bacterial enteritis was 40.6 (95% confidence interval = 28.6-57.5; P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial enteritis is a significant risk factor for the subsequent development of intussusception in children.
TI  - Presence of zoonotic pathogens in physico-chemically characterized manures from hog finishing houses using different production systems.
AB  - Hog production has been intensified in Eastern Canada, by 50% over the last 20years. Wastes are now managed with conventional production systems (slatted floor), litter systems or source separation systems. We studied the presence of total and fecal coliforms, Campylobacter, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Yersinia enterocolitica, Giardia and Cryptosporidium in the manure of all of these production systems. The concentrations of the studied zoonotic pathogens did not differ between the conventional and the litter systems investigated. The source separation system yielded separated solid and liquid fractions. Total and fecal coliforms, C. perfringens, Enterococcus, E. coli, and Y. enterocolitica were found in the solids and the liquid fractions of a source separation system.Campylobacter species were not detected in the liquid fractions. Zoonotic pathogens are therefore, found in the manure of Eastern Canadian hog finishing houses equipped either with conventional, sawdust litter or source separation systems. Pathogens inactivation will require changes in manure management practices or the use of manure disinfection methods.
TI  - Cesarean delivery and risk of intestinal bacterial infection.
AB  - BACKGROUND: An individual's intestinal bacterial flora is established soon after  birth. Delivery by Cesarean section (c-section) deprives the newborn of colonization with maternal vaginal bacteria. We determined whether delivery by c-section is associated with an altered risk of infection with intestinal bacterial pathogens. METHODS: In a cohort of 1.7 million Danes born 1973-2005 we identified cases of laboratory-confirmed non-typhoidal Salmonella species, Campylobacter species, Yersinia enterocolitica, Shigella species, and Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli from 1991-2005 in the National Registry of Enteric Pathogens. Using Poisson-regression we estimated confounder-adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for infection according to mode of delivery. RESULTS: During 14.0 million person-years of follow-up, 22,486 individuals were diagnosed with 1 intestinal bacterial infection. C-section was associated with a small increase in risk at age 1 to <2 years (IRR, 1.09; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.18) and at age 2 to <5 years (IRR, 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.17), but after age 5 years, there was no significant association. Assuming causality only 0.62% of intestinal bacterial infections were attributable to c-section. CONCLUSIONS: Mode of delivery appears not to be a clinically relevant determinant of risk for intestinal bacterial infections. The possible impact of increasing frequencies of c-section on the overall burden of intestinal bacterial infections appears negligible.
TI  - Wild boars as an important reservoir for foodborne pathogens.
AB  - One hundred fifty-three wild boars shot in the canton of Geneva, Switzerland, were studied for the occurrence of foodborne pathogens. Tonsils and fecal samples of the animals were examined using real-time polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked fluorescent immunoassay, and cultural methods. The detection rate of Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, stx-positive Escherichia coli, and Listeria monocytogenes was 12%, 35%, 20%, 9%, and 17%, respectively, when tonsil samples were studied. Only Y. enterocolitica (5%) and L. monocytogenes (1%) were detected in fecal samples. None of the samples was positive for Campylobacter spp. Females (71%) and young animals (61%) carried more frequently one or more pathogens than males (53%) and older ones (44%). In total, 8 Salmonella spp., 14 Y. enterocolitica, 4 Y. pseudotuberculosis, and 26 L. monocytogenes strains were further characterized. Most of the Salmonella spp. strains were of serotype Salmonella Enteritidis (75%) followed by serotypes Salmonella Stourbridge (13%) and Salmonella Veneziana (13%). L. monocytogenes strains belonged to serotypes 1/2a (42%), 1/2b (19%), and 4b (38%). Serotypes O:3 (36%), O:5,27 (21%), and O:9 (29%) were identified among Y. enterocolitica strains and serotypes O:1 (75%) and O:2 (25%) among Y. pseudotuberculosis strains. This study shows that wild boars are frequent carriers of foodborne pathogens. High wild boar densities and increasing popularity of outdoor ranging of pigs may intensify the risk of transmission of these pathogens to fattening pigs.
TI  - Evidence-based semiquantitative methodology for prioritization of foodborne zoonoses.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To prioritize an extended list of food- and water-borne zoonoses to allow food safety authorities to focus on the most relevant hazards in the food chain. METHODS: An evidence-based semiquantitative methodology was developed. Scores were given by 35 scientific experts in the field of animal and public health, food, and clinical microbiology and epidemiology to 51 zoonotic agents according to five criteria related to public health (severity and occurrence in humans), animal health (severity of disease coupled with economic consequences and occurrence in animals), and food (occurrence in food). The scoring procedure was standardized and evidence-based as experts were provided, for each zoonotic agent, a same set of up-to-date help information data related to the five criteria. Independently, the relative importance of the five criteria was weighted by seven food chain risk managers. The zoonotic agents were ranked based on overall weighted scores and were grouped in four statistically different levels of importance. RESULTS: The following foodborne zoonotic pathogens were classified as "most important": Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., Listeria monocytogenes, and verocytotoxigenic Escherichia coli. A second group of "significant importance" included Toxoplasma gondii, the agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, Clostridium botulinum, Staphylococcus aureus, Cryptosporidium parvum, Mycobacterium bovis, Echinococcus granulosus, Streptococcus spp., Echinococcus multilocularis, Yersinia enterocolitica, Mycobacterium avium, Fasciola hepatica, Giardia intestinalis, and Rotavirus. CONCLUSIONS: This methodology allowed to rank 51 zoonotic agents with objectivity and taking account of a combined input from risk assessors and risk managers. APPLICATIONS: These results support food safety policy makers to establish the multiannual monitoring program of foodborne zoonoses. They also enable to identify knowledge gaps on specific zoonotic agents and to formulate key research questions. Principally, this method of prioritization is of general interest as it can be applied for any other ranking exercise and in any country.
TI  - Occurrence of Salmonella, Campylobacter, Yersinia enterocolitica, Escherichia coli O157 and Listeria monocytogenes in swine.
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the occurrence of major bacterial  foodborne pathogens in swine. In total, 359 samples from manure storage tanks (91) and fresh pooled faeces (268) obtained from finisher (110), sows (78) and weanlings (80) were collected and tested. Campylobacter, Salmonella, Yersinia enterocolitica, Escherichia coli O157 and Listeria monocytogenes were isolated from 36.5%, 31.5%, 5.8%, 3.3% and 3.3% of samples respectively. All E. coli O157 isolates found on 10 farms were tested but none was determined to be E. coli O157:H7. Salmonella and Campylobacter were more likely to be detected from stored manure rather than from fresh faecal samples. Yersinia enterocolitica tended to be detected more commonly from fresh samples than from manure pits. Listeria monocytogenes was not recovered from manure pits or from sow faecal samples and only infrequently found in the faeces of weanling pigs and finisher pigs. The proportion of positive samples showed a seasonal change. Salmonella was twice as likely not be recovered in winter, whereas the chance of culturing Campylobacter was higher in winter. The 113 Salmonella isolates recovered on 24 farms and the four most common serovars were Salmonella Typhimurium var. Copenhagen (31.0%), Salmonella Derby (12.4%), S. Typhimurium (10.6%) and Salmonella Agona (10.6%). Of 131 Campylobacter isolates recovered on 21 farms, 118 isolates were Campylobacter coli and 13 isolates could not be speciated. Fifteen of 21 Y. enterocolitica isolates found on 15 farms were detected in finisher pigs. The sero/biogroups of Y. enterocolitica were O3/biotype 4 (16 isolates), O6,30/biotype 1A (three isolates), O5/biotype 1A (one isolate) and O8/biotype 1B (one isolate). These findings provide baseline information on the distribution of important zoonotic pathogens in swine and indicate that pigs should be considered as a possible source of foodborne diseases in humans.
TI  - A DNA array based assay for the characterization of microbial community in raw milk.
AB  - An oligonucleotide array based on PCR method containing a combination of probes for taxonomic markers and species-specific virulence genes was developed for the simultaneous identification of 14 Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) and food-borne pathogenic bacteria in raw milk. The hypervariable regions V3 and V6 of 16S, together with a variable region of 23S rRNA genes and several genes specific for virulence factors were selected. Universal primers and multiplex PCR were used for the rapid differentiation of bacterial species and low concentration of specific pathogenic and spoilage bacteria were detected in milk. The dominant species such as Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactococcus lactis, andLeuconostoc lactis were identified by indirect-labelling reactions based upon incorporation of amino-allyl dUTPs. The results regarding food-borne pathogens detection showed highly specific hybridisation patterns with the genomic DNA from Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, Salmonella thyphimurium, Listeria monocytogenes and Yersinia enterocolitica. A clear differentiation of dominant species present in a complex microbial community such as raw milk was achieved by the application of short oligonucleotide probes which discriminate sequences differing by few nucleotides.
TI  - Molecular typing methodologies for microbial source tracking and epidemiological  investigations of Gram-negative bacterial foodborne pathogens.
AB  - Gram-negative bacterial foodborne pathogens are a worldwide cause of morbidity and mortality. The ability to carry out epidemiological investigations to determine the primary sources of bacterial contamination is important to improve public health. Multiple methods are available for bacterial source tracking and to determine the distribution of pathogens isolated from sick patients. The molecular based typing methods available fall into three general categories: those based on restriction analysis of the bacterial DNA; those based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of particular genetic targets; and those based on the identification of DNA sequence polymorphisms. The techniques that are examined in this review include: plasmid analysis, restriction fragment length polymorphism methods, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis, PCR-based genotyping, variable number of tandem repeat analysis, multilocus sequence typing, and single nucleotide polymorphism analysis. These methods are described along with a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the techniques for genotyping the major Gram-negative foodborne pathogens--Campylobacter spp., Salmonella enterica, Shigella spp., Escherichia coli, and Yersinia enterocolitica.
TI  - Transmission of foodborne zoonotic pathogens to riparian areas by grazing sheep.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine if sheep grazing near riparian areas on pasture in Ontario are an important risk factor for the contamination of water with specific foodborne pathogens. Ten Ontario sheep farms were visited weekly for 12 wk during the summer of 2005. Samples of feces, soil, and water were collected and analyzed for the presence of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp., Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli, and Yersinia enterocolitica, by bacteriological identification and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The data was analyzed as repeated measures over time using mixed models. No samples were positive for Salmonella, and no samples were confirmed positive for E. coli O157:H7 after PCR. Levels of Campylobacter were highest in the soil, but did not differ between soil where sheep grazed or camped and roadside soil that had never been grazed (P = 0.85). Levels of Yersinia were highest in water samples and were higher in soil where sheep had access (P = 0.01). The prevalence of positive Campylobacter and Yersinia samples were not associated with locations where sheep spent more time (Campylobacter P = 0.46, Yersinia P = 0.99). There was no effect of stocking density on the prevalence of Campylobacter (P = 0.30), but as the stocking density increased the levels of Yersinia increased (P = 0.04). It was concluded that although sheep transmit Yersinia to their environment, pastured sheep flocks are not major risk factors for the transmission of zoonotic pathogens into water.
TI  - Factors related to the carriage of Verocytotoxigenic E. coli, Salmonella, thermophilic Campylobacter and Yersinia enterocolitica in cattle, sheep and pigs at slaughter.
AB  - A 12-month abattoir study was undertaken from January 2003. We collected 7492 intestinal samples from cattle, sheep and pigs at slaughter. Rectal samples were taken from cattle and sheep and caecal samples from pigs. They were examined for verocytotoxigenic E. coli (VTEC) O157, Salmonella, thermophilic Campylobacter and Yersinia enterocolitica. Data were collected on the animal from which the sample came and this information was analysed to look at potential risk factors for carriage of these organisms. Logistic regression models were run where an adequate number of positive results were available. This revealed that VTEC O157 carriage in cattle was associated with the summer period and that age was a protective factor. Salmonella carriage in pigs was associated with lairage times >12 h, the North East and not feeding when there was no bedding available. In cattle, carriage was associated with the summer period, the Eastern region of GB and dairy animals. In sheep a spring seasonal effect was seen, which coincided with the lambing period. The carriage of thermophilic Campylobacter in cattle was associated with single-species abattoirs, with age a protective factor. In sheep, winter was a risk period with lairage management influential. For pigs, lairage times of <12 h were found to be associated with carriage. A seasonal trend for carriage of Y. enterocolitica in all species was demonstrated with the period December-May a risk. For cattle, age was also a risk factor; for sheep feeding in the lairage and for pigs being held overnight were risk factors.
TI  - Etiology of acute gastroenteritis in three sentinel general practices, Austria 2007.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We studied the etiology of acute gastroenteritis in a village with a  total population of approximately 6,000. This is the first study in Austria that has investigated a broad range of pathogens recovered from an unselected population of patients who had consulted general practitioners because of gastroenteritis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 2007, all patients who visited one of three local general practitioners for acute gastroenteritis were invited to provide stool specimens to be tested for Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) (mTSB enrichment [R-Biopharm] followed by toxin ELISA plus culture), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), Yersinia, Vibrio cholerae, Clostridium difficile (toxin plus culture), rotavirus plus adenovirus (RIDA) Quick Rotavirus/Adenovirus Combi test), Giardia duodenalis plus Cryptosporidium parvum (RIDA) Quick Cryptosporidium/Giardia Combi test), astrovirus (ELISA), and norovirus (reverse-transcriptase PCR). RESULTS: Stool specimens were provided by 306 patients (161 female) with acute diarrhea. The ages of the patients ranged from 1 to 89 years (mean 37, median 36). Pathogens were detected in 71 (23.2%) patients, with incidence peaks in February and June. Norovirus accounted for 36.0% of positive results, C. difficile for 18.7%, rotavirus for 17.3%, Campylobacter for 9.3%, Salmonella for 6.6%, adenovirus for 5.4%, G. duodenalis and C. parvum for 2.7% each, and Yersinia enterocolitica for 1.3%. No cases of shigellosis or infection with EHEC, EPEC, or astrovirus were diagnosed. Viruses accounted for 58.7% of the 75 positive results, bacteria for 36.0%, and parasites for 5.3%. CONCLUSION: Our study underlines a dominant role of norovirus and toxigenic C. difficile as etiologic agents of acute gastroenteritis among the patients of general practitioners.
TI  - Improvement in detection of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli in patients with travelers' diarrhea by increasing the number of E. coli colonies tested.
AB  - No cause of one-third of travelers' diarrhea (TD) cases can be detected despite microbiologic assessment. We propose that these pathogen-negative TD cases include undetected enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC). As a standard in diagnostic microbiology, samples of five E. coli colonies were tested to detect ETEC from stool cultures. We compared the sensitivities and the number of ETEC detected by 20 colonies with those of 5, 10, and 15 colonies. The percent detection of ETEC with five E. coli colonies was significantly different from that using 20 E. coli colonies. Of the 116 subjects studied, the number positive for ETEC for 5, 10, 15 and 20 colonies tested were 22 (19.0%), 37 (31.9%), 45 (38.8%) and 46 (39.7%), respectively. Based on our results, we recommend the testing of at least 10 E. coli colonies for optimum detection of ETEC in patients with TD.
TI  - Detection of Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Vibrio cholerae, and Campylobacter spp. enteropathogens by 3-reaction multiplex polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - The magnitude of bacterial diarrhea in developing countries is largely unknown because affordable detection methods are not available. We have developed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay for use in areas with limited resources to screen for diarrheogenic strains from clinical isolates. To simplify the assay and minimize reagents, our method implemented the use of plasmids rather than bacteria as template controls and the use of bacterial suspensions or crude DNA preparations rather than purified genomic DNA as template DNA. The assay consisted of 3 PCR reactions using 3 groups of 5 to 6 primer pairs to identify the 11 most common bacterial diarrheogenic pathogens. The 3-reaction multiplex PCR amplifies DNA targets specific for each 1 of the 6 Escherichia coli diarrheogenic strains and the 5 non-E. coli diarrheogenic strains, including Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Campylobacter spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Vibrio cholerae. The assay may provide an important epidemiologic tool to investigate the role of diarrheogenic bacterial pathogens in areas of the world with limited resources.
TI  - A novel DNA microarray for rapid diagnosis of enteropathogenic bacteria in stool  specimens of patients with diarrhea.
AB  - A microarray technique for the detection and identification of enteropathogenic bacteria at the species and subspecies levels was developed in this study, and the target bacteria included pathogenic Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Salmonella enterica, Campylobacter jejuni, Shigellae, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Listeria monocytogenes. The virulence gene of each pathogen was chosen as the amplification target, labeled with a fluorescence dye by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and hybridized to the specific virulence gene probes that had been immobilized on a microchip. Stool specimens from 34 patients with diarrhea were tested in this study. Five were positive for multiple genera. Nested PCRs and sequencing were used to amplify and identify the related genes, which were found to share 95.8% to 100% of the nucleotide identity with the corresponding regions in the Genbank database. Real-time PCR was used to determine the number of gene copies to determine the sensitivity of this technique, which was shown to be 58 copies/microl. The results indicated that the microarray technique which targets multiple virulence genes of enteropathogenic bacteria at the species and subspecies levels is an attractive diagnostic tool for rapidly and simultaneously identifying multiple enteropathogenic pathogens in clinical practice, especially in patients with infectious diarrhea.
TI  - Effects of pulsed electric fields on pathogenic microorganisms of major concern in fluid foods: a review.
AB  - Pathogenic microorganisms such as Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Campylobacter jejuni have been implicated in foodborne diseases and outbreaks worldwide. These bacteria have been associated with the consumption of fresh fruit juices, milk, and dairy products, which are foodstuff, highly demanded by consumers in retails and supermarkets. Nowadays, consumers require high quality, fresh-like, and safe foods. Pulsed electric field (PEF) is a non-thermal preservation method, able to inactivate pathogenic microorganisms without significant loss of the organoleptic and nutritional properties of food. The PEF treatment effectiveness to destroy bacteria such as Listeria innocua, E. coli, Salmonella Typhimurium, E. coli O157:H7 and E. coli 8739 at pasteurization levels (> or = 5.0 log(10) cycles) in some fluid foods was reported. However, data on the inactivation of some microorganisms such as Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Campylobacter jejuni in fluid foods by PEF processing is very limited. Therefore, future works should be focused toward the inactivation of these pathogenic bacteria in real foods.
TI  - Transcriptome analysis of organisms with food safety relevance.
AB  - Transcriptome analysis using microarrays has become a powerful tool to better understand the process of disease and other complex biological processes such as food spoilage and biofilm formation. This review is divided into two basic sections: 1) a short history and description of microarrays and 2) a discussion of studies involving bacterial food safety pathogens that focused on whole genome transcript analysis. Not included are the many studies using microarrays to identify, diagnose, or genetically characterize these organisms. This review focuses on studies involving Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp., Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Many of the studies involve altering the growth environment to simulate stress conditions and the use of host-pathogen model systems to explore virulence mechanisms. Few studies use conditions that might be considered unique to the food industry. Exceptions are studies of biofilm-specific transcriptome changes and analysis following pressure treatment. This review should not be considered as a comprehensive review, and where appropriate, species-specific reviews are cited that are more complete.
TI  - Bactericidal effect of solar water disinfection under real sunlight conditions.
AB  - Batch solar disinfection (SODIS) inactivation kinetics are reported for suspensions in water of Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and endospores of Bacillus subtilis, exposed to strong natural sunlight in Spain and Bolivia. The exposure time required for complete inactivation (at least 4-log-unit reduction and below the limit of detection, 17 CFU/ml) under conditions of strong natural sunlight (maximum global irradiance, approximately 1,050 W m(-2) +/- 10 W m(-2)) was as follows: C. jejuni, 20 min; S. epidermidis, 45 min; enteropathogenic E. coli, 90 min; Y. enterocolitica, 150 min. Following incomplete inactivation of B. subtilis endospores after the first day, reexposure of these samples on the following day found that 4% (standard error, 3%) of the endospores remained viable after a cumulative exposure time of 16 h of strong natural sunlight. SODIS is shown to be effective against the vegetative cells of a number of emerging waterborne pathogens; however, bacterial species which are spore forming may survive this intervention process.
TI  - Prevalence of gastrointestinal bacterial pathogens in a population of zoo animals.
AB  - Faecal prevalence of gastrointestinal bacterial pathogens, including Campylobacter, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, as well as Arcobacter, were examined in 317 faecal specimens from 44 animal species in Belfast Zoological Gardens, during July-September 2006. Thermophilic campylobacters including Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli and Campylobacter lari, were the most frequently isolated pathogens, where members of this genus were isolated from 11 animal species (11 of 44; 25%). Yersinia spp. were isolated from seven animal species (seven of 44; 15.9%) and included, Yersinia enterocolitica (five of seven isolates; 71.4%) and one isolate each of Yersinia frederiksenii and Yersinia kristensenii. Only one isolate of Salmonella was obtained throughout the entire study, which was an isolate of Salmonella dublin (O 1,9,12: H g, p), originating from tiger faeces after enrichment. None of the animal species found in public contact areas of the zoo were positive for any gastrointestinal bacterial pathogens. Also, water from the lake in the centre of the grounds, was examined for the same bacterial pathogens and was found to contain C. jejuni. This study is the first report on the isolation of a number of important bacterial pathogens from a variety of novel host species, C. jejuni from the red kangaroo (Macropus rufus), C. lari from a maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus), Y. kristensenii from a vicugna (Vicugna vicugna) and Y. enterocolitica from a maned wolf and red panda (Ailurus fulgens). In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the faeces of animals in public contact areas of the zoo were not positive for the bacterial gastrointestinal pathogens examined. This is reassuring for the public health of visitors, particularly children, who enjoy this educational and recreational resource.
TI  - Impact of infections and normal flora in nonhuman primates on drug development.
AB  - Preclinical safety studies that are required for the marketing approval of a pharmaceutical include single and repeat dose studies in rodent and nonrodent species. The use of nonhuman primates (NHPs), primarily macaques, as the nonrodent species has increased in recent years, in part due to the increase in development of biopharmaceuticals and immunomodulatory agents. Depending on the source of the macaques, they may vary in genetic background, normal flora, and/or the incidence of preexisting pathogens and inflammatory conditions. As the use of alternative sources of macaques rises to meet the increased demand for these animals in biomedical research, the toxicologic pathologist should be well versed in NHP pathology to adequately assess potential drug-related effects in the context of these variations. Such knowledge is particularly important in studies involving immunomodulatory drugs as the toxicologic pathologist should anticipate which type(s) of infections are most likely to arise depending on which arm of the immune system is modulated. The purpose of this review is to discuss the immunosuppressive (e.g., simian type D retrovirus, simian immunodeficiency virus) and opportunistic viruses (e.g., cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, simian virus 40, rhesus rhadinovirus, and lymphocryptovirus), primary and opportunistic bacteria (e.g., Campylobacter spp., Shigella flexneri, Yersinia enterocolitica, Moraxella catarrhalis, Mycobacterium avium complex, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli), and parasites (e.g., Plasmodium spp., Schistosoma spp., Strongyloides fulleborni) that have had the most profound impact on the interpretation of drug safety studies and/or that may reemerge as alternative sources of NHPs are used for drug safety studies.
TI  - The effect of blast chilling on occurrence of human pathogenic Yersinia enterocolitica compared to Campylobacter spp. and numbers of hygienic indicators on pig carcasses.
AB  - In this study, the occurrence of Yersinia enterocolitica on pig carcasses was compared to the occurrence of Campylobacter spp., and to the numbers of aerobic micro-organisms, coliform bacteria, thermotolerant coliform bacteria, and Escherichia coli before and after blast chilling. Y. enterocolitica O:3/biovar 4 was isolated from five (8.3%) of 60 carcasses before blast chilling, and also from five of them 1 h after blast chilling. Therefore this procedure does not seem to have a significant effect on the occurrence of pathogenic Y. enterocolitica on pig carcasses. Y. enterocolitica O:9/biovar 2 was isolated from a pig source in Norway for the first time when this sero/biovariant was isolated from one of the carcasses before blast chilling. Campylobacter spp. was isolated from 34 (56.7%) of 60 carcass samples before blast chilling. After blast chilling Campylobacter spp. was isolated from only one (1.7%) of the 60 carcasses. There was a significant decrease of the numbers of coliform bacteria, thermotolerant coliform bacteria and E. coli after blast chilling. The number of aerobic micro-organisms did not decrease after this step. In contrast to the drastic decrease in the occurrence of campylobacter-positive carcasses and the significant decrease of the numbers of coliform bacteria, thermotolerant coliform bacteria and E. coli, blast chilling does not seem to have a significant effect on the occurrence of human pathogenic Y. enterocolitica on pig carcasses.
TI  - Microbiological quality of fresh, minimally-processed fruit and vegetables, and sprouts from retail establishments.
AB  - A survey of fresh and minimally-processed fruit and vegetables, and sprouts was conducted in several retail establishments in the Lleida area (Catalonia, Spain) during 2005-2006 to determine whether microbial contamination, and in particular potentially pathogenic bacteria, was present under these commodities. A total of 300 samples--including 21 ready-to-eat fruits, 28 whole fresh vegetables, 15 sprout samples and 237 ready-to-eat salads containing from one to six vegetables--were purchased from 4 supermarkets. They were tested for mesophilic and psychrotrophic aerobic counts, yeasts and moulds, lactic acid bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, presumptive E. coli and Listeria monocytogenes counts as well as for the presence of Salmonella, E. coli O157:H7, Yersinia enterocolitica and thermotolerant Campylobacter. Results for the fresh-cut vegetables that we analyzed showed that, in general, the highest microorganism counts were associated with grated carrot, arugula and spinach (7.8, 7.5 and 7.4 log cfu g(-1) of aerobic mesophilic microorganisms; 6.1, 5.8 and 5.2 log cfu g(-1) of yeast and moulds; 5.9, 4.0 and 5.1 log cfu g(-1) lactic acid bacteria and 6.2, 5.3 and 6.0 log cfu g(-1) of Enterobacteriaceae). The lowest counts were generally associated with fresh-cut endive and lettuce (6.2 and 6.3 log cfu g(-1) of aerobic mesophilic microorganisms; 4.4 and 4.6 log cfu g(-1) of yeast and moulds; 2.7 and 3.8 log cfu g(-1) lactic acid bacteria and 4.8 and 4.4 log cfu g(-1) of Enterobacteriaceae). Counts of psychrotrophic microorganisms were as high as those of mesophilic microorganisms. Microbiological counts for fresh-cut fruit were very low. Sprouts were highly contaminated with mesophilic (7.9 log cfu g(-1)), psychrotrophic microorganisms (7.3 log cfu g(-1)) and Enterobacteriaceae (7.2 log cfu g(-1)) and showed a high incidence of E. coli (40% of samples). Of the samples analyzed, four (1.3%) were Salmonella positive and two (0.7%) harboured L. monocytogenes. None of the samples was positive for E. coli O157:H7, pathogenic Y. enterocolitica or thermotolerant Campylobacter.
TI  - [Evaluation of usefulness of commercial recomwell Campylobacter enzyme--linked immunosorbent assays for routine serodiagnosis of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli infections].
AB  - The commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA recomWell Campylobacter) from Mikrogen was evaluated for the diagnosis of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli infections. Serum samples from 20 healthy controls, 44 persons with symptoms of primary Campylobacter infection and 24 serum samples from patients with Yersinia enterocolitica or Salmonella infections were tested. This ELISA assay detects IgA and IgG antibodies against three recombinant antigens of the Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli: OMP 18 (18 kDa), PEB4 (31 kDa) and P39 (39 kDa). The healthy controls showed significantly lower antibody titers in all two immunoglobulin classes. The IgA antibodies were diagnosed only in 2 (18.2%) serum samples obtained from patients with bacteriologically confirmed campylobacteriosis. The presence of IgG antibodies was confirmed in 82% of serum samples. Furthermore, we showed that 66.7% of the 33 serum samples obtained from the patients suspected for campylobacteriosis not confirmed by isolation, were positive for IgG and 15.2% for IgA antibodies. We observed also not specific reactions in ELISA recom Well Campylobacter with sera obtained form patients with yersiniosis and salmonelosis. This study demonstrates the usefulness of commercially available assay for the routine diagnosis of Campylobacter infection but with some limitations.
TI  - Outbreak of acute gastroenteritis of unknown etiology caused by contaminated drinking water in a rural village in Austria, August 2006.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In August 2006 a physician from a rural village reported an outbreak  of acute gastroenteritis. An investigation was undertaken in order to determine the magnitude of the outbreak, the source of infection and to prevent further disease. This is the first published outbreak of acute gastroenteritis caused by contaminated drinking water in Austria. METHODS: For descriptive epidemiology, the investigators had to rely on voluntary cooperation from physicians and patients, data collected by a police officer and data on sick leave reported by physicians to the health insurance system. RESULTS: Microbiological testing of water samples indicated that this cluster was caused by fecal contamination of untreated drinking water. Age and sex distributions were available for 146 of 160 cases: ages ranged from 5 to 91 years (median 45) and 81 cases (55.5%) were female. Stool samples from 14 patients were sent for microbiological analysis: all tested negative for Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shigella and Yersinia enterocolitica. Specimens were not tested for viruses, parasites or enteropathogenic Escherichia coli. DISCUSSION: In this outbreak no identification was made of pathogenic microorganisms in stool samples from affected patients, despite the occurrence of fecal indicator organisms in samples of drinking water. In outbreaks of gastroenteritis, medical practitioners should encourage microbiological testing beyond the limited routine program. Public health officers must be made aware that the spectrum of routine laboratory tests on stool specimens does not cover the wide array of pathogens capable of causing waterborne outbreaks. The springs serving the affected village originate in a mountainous area of karst formations, and heavy falls of rain that occurred at the beginning of the outbreak may explain introduction of fecal bacteria. In view of the unsolved problem of possible future contamination of springs in karst areas, the water department of this district authority has issued an order requesting installation of a permanent ultraviolet water-treatment facility.
TI  - Ammonia disinfection of animal feeds --laboratory study.
AB  - Animal feeds may be contaminated, accidentally or maliciously, with a number of zoonotic bacteria. Animal infections with these bacterial agents, whether or not they cause animal disease, may lead to human illnesses. Anhydrous ammonia was introduced on farms in developed countries as a high-nitrogen soil amendment, but later found use in enhancing crude protein in low-quality roughage fed to ruminants and in neutralizing mycotoxins in fungus-infested feed grains. Although ammonia has been known to be effective against bacteria in other contexts (e.g., manure, community sewage sludge, seeds for sprouting, and boneless lean beef trimmings), it appears that the antibacterial effect of ammoniating animal feeds had not been tested. In the present study, samples of roughage (wheat straw, corn silage) and concentrates (corn grain, cottonseed) produced as animal feed were contaminated with dried-on zoonotic bacteria (Salmonella Newport in all; Campylobacte jejuni, E. coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica in corn grain only). Disinfection with anhydrous ammonia gas was conducted for 24 h at room temperature ( 25 degrees C). The treatment was least effective in silage because the silage alone showed strong antibacterial activity, which may have been slightly reduced by ammoniation. In the other three feeds, depending on the initial level of contamination, ammonia destruction of >or= 5 log10 cfu/g (99.999%) of the selected contaminant was usually observed.
TI  - Isolation and purification of enterocin E-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Strain NRRL B-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecium, or Enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as antagonistic to Campylobacter jejuni. The isolate produced a 5,362-Da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, S. enterica serovar Choleraesuis, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, S. enterica serovar Gallinarum, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Yersinia enterocolitica, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni, and 20 other Campylobacter species isolates. The enterocin, E-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. The proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin E-760 was demonstrated upon treatment with various proteolytic enzymes. Specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase K, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. The enterocin demonstrated thermostability by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees C and was stable at pH values between 5.0 and 8.7. However, activity was lost below pH 3.0 and above pH 9.5. Administration of enterocin E-760-treated feed significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized with two strains of C. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) CFU. Enterocin E-760 also significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired Campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.
TI  - [Epidemiological analysis of campylobacteriosis reported by Sanitary Epidemiological Station in Bielsko-Biala, Silesia, in Poland].
AB  - The results of the epidemiological analysis of campylobacteriosis reported by Regional Laboratory of Sanitary Epidemiological Station in Bielsko-Biala (PSSE Bielsko-Biala), Silesia voivodeship in Poland are presented. From August 2005 to July 2006, stool samples from 723 diarrhea cases were examined for the presence of Campylobacter as well as Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, enteropathogenic (EPEC) and enterohaemorrhagic (EHEC) E. coli. From stool samples of 163 patients 170 bacterial etiological agents were isolated. The most frequently detected bacterial etiological agents were Salmonella spp. n=79 (46%) and Campylobacter spp. n=70 (41%). The other bacterial pathogens isolated from stool samples were EPEC n=17 (10%), Yersinia enterocolitica n=3 (2%) and E. coli 0157 (VT+) n=1. The most frequently isolated species of Campylobacter spp. was C. jejuni--87%. In 7 out of 70 cases, Campylobacter spp. were isolated together with S. Enteritidis (n=2), E. coli EPEC (n=4) and verotoxic E. coli O157 (n=1). Patients' ages ranged from 0 to 78 years. Most (59%) of the Campylobacter spp. were isolated from children under the age of 2. The seasonal peak of campylobacteriosis was observed between July and November and in May.
TI  - Microbiological baseline study of swine carcasses at Swedish slaughterhouses.
AB  - This 13-month survey was conducted to estimate the prevalence and counts of foodborne pathogenic bacteria and indicator bacteria on swine carcasses in Sweden. A total of 541 swine carcasses were sampled by swabbing prechill at the 10 largest slaughterhouses in Sweden. Pathogenic Yersinia enterocolitica was detected by PCR in 16% of the samples. The probability of finding Y. enterocolitica increased with increasing counts of Escherichia coli. No samples were positive for Salmonella. The prevalences of Campylobacter, Listeria monocytogenes, and verocytotoxin-producing E. coli were low (1, 2, and 1%, respectively). None of the verocytotoxin-positive enrichments, as determined by a reverse passive latex agglutination assay, tested positive for the virulence genes eaeA or hlyA by PCR. Coagulase-positive staphylococci, E. coli, and Enterobacteriaceae were recovered from 30, 57, and 87% of the samples, respectively, usually at low levels (95th percentiles, 0.79, 1.09, and 1.30 log CFU/cm2, respectively). The mean log level of Enterobacteriaceae was 0.35 log CFU/cm2 higher than that of E. coli on carcasses positive for both bacteria. The mean log level of aerobic microorganisms was 3.48 log CFU/cm2, and the 95th percentile was 4.51 log CFU/cm2. These data may be useful for risk assessment purposes and can serve as a basis for risk management actions, such as the use of E. coli as an alternative indicator organism for process hygiene control.
TI  - Intestinal carriage of verocytotoxigenic Escherichia coli O157, Salmonella, thermophilic Campylobacter and Yersinia enterocolitica, in cattle, sheep and pigs at slaughter in Great Britain during 2003.
AB  - An abattoir survey was undertaken to determine the prevalence of foodborne zoonotic organisms colonizing cattle, sheep and pigs at slaughter in Great Britain. The study ran for 12 months from January 2003, involved 93 abattoirs and collected 7703 intestinal samples. The design was similar to two previous abattoir surveys undertaken in 1999-2000 allowing comparisons. Samples were examined for VTEC O157, Salmonella, thermophilic Campylobacter and Yersinia enterocolitica. The prevalence of VTEC O157 faecal carriage was 4.7% in cattle, 0.7% in sheep and 0.3% in pigs. A significant decrease in sheep was detected from the previous survey (1.7%). Salmonella carriage was 1.4% in cattle, a significant increase from the previous survey of 0.2%. In sheep, faecal carriage was 1.1% a significant increase from the previous survey (0.1%). In pigs, carriage was 23.4%, consistent with the previous study. Thermophilic Campylobacter spp. were isolated from 54.6% of cattle, 43.8% of sheep and 69.3% of pigs. Y. enterocolitica was isolated from 4.5% of cattle, 8.0% of sheep and 10.2% of pigs.
TI  - [Prevalence of the bacteria causing diarrea in a Rosario Hospital, Argentina].
AB  - Bacterial agents causing diarrea in patients attended in a hospital of Rosario, Argentina. The frequency of bacterial agents causing diarrhea can vary in patients of different areas, and through the time. In an epidemiological surveillance we studied 304 patients with diarrheal diseases looking for Salmonella enterica, Shigella spp, Campylobacter spp, Aeromonas spp, Yersinia enterocolitica, and diarrheogenic Escherichia coli. C. jejuni was isolated in 30 patients (9,9 %), Salmonella in 18 (5,9 %), and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) in 7 (2,3 %). Most cases due ton C. jejuni had mucus and/or blood in their feces. Unexpectedly we didn't fine any cases due to Shigella spp. There was much less cases due to EPEC than in our previous studies, and occurred only in children of less than 5 years old. It is necesary to take in consideration that C. jejuni cause nearly all the cases of diarrhea in patients with mucus and blood in their feces actually in our region.
TI  - [Food borne infectious outbreaks, Austria 2005].
AB  - In Austria, a total of 606 food borne outbreaks, affecting 1,910 people altogether (including 368 hospitalized patients and 1 fatal outcome) were documented in 2005. Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp. accounted for 99% of all reported outbreaks. Fortysix (8%) of the 606 outbreaks were acquired abroad. Bacteria caused all but one of the 560 domestically acquired food borne outbreaks: 427 (76%) were due to Salmonella spp., 128 (23%) due to Campylobacter spp. and two outbreaks each due to enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli and Yersinia enterocolitica. Norovirus caused an outbreak affecting 22 persons. The respective hospitalization rate for domestically acquired Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp. infections was 20% and 16%. Of those outbreaks where information as to the source was provided, eggs were implicated in 57%, meat products (especially poultry) in 30% and milk or dairy products (especially raw milk) in 4%. The ratio between family outbreaks and general outbreaks was 89% to 11%. For general outbreaks the following locations of exposure were given: commercial food suppliers (incl. restaurants, cafeterias) 34 x, family celebrations 14 x, nursery schools 4 x, festivities (e.g. fairs) 3 x, nursing homes twice and once a mixed outbreak involving commercial food suppliers plus homes (Austria-wide S. Enteritidis PT19 outbreak). In our opinion, the relatively high number of family outbreaks merely reflects the still insufficient quality of epidemiological outbreak investigation in Austria, i.e. lack of consolidating individual clusters into larger food borne outbreaks which exceed district or provincial borders.
TI  - [Risk of hospitalisation due to foodborne bacterial gastroenteritis--secondary publication].
AB  - In a matched cohort study we estimate the risk of hospitalisation due to gastroenteritis, complications and sequelae after infections with zoonotic Salmonella, Campylobacter spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, E. coli and Shigella infections. Out of 52,783 patients, 7,524 (14.4%) were hospitalized with gastroenteritis, 647 (1.2%) with complications and 865 (1.7%) with long-term sequelae. In Denmark in 2005 there were 6,010 registered episodes of infections with bacteria that are usually foodborne, contributing to an estimated 6,267 days of hospitalisation.
TI  - Microbiological baseline study of broiler chickens at Swedish slaughterhouses.
AB  - This 1-year study was conducted to estimate the prevalence and concentrations of  pathogenic and indicator bacteria on Swedish broiler chickens. A total of 636 chilled carcasses were collected from 10 slaughterhouses and sent to the National Food Administration for analyses of carcass rinses. No carcasses were positive for Salmonella. Campylobacter, predominantly Campylobacter jejuni, were detected on 15% (by enrichment) or 14% (by direct plating) of the carcasses. With one exception, all samples from late December through April were Campylobacter negative. The 10th and 90th percentiles of Campylobacter numbers per carcasses were 3.0 and 5.0 log CFU, respectively, and the maximum was 7.1 log CFU. Coagulase-positive staphylococci were detected on 68% of the carcasses, with a maximum of 3.5 log CFU/cm2. The 10th and 90th percentiles were 3.4 and 4.4 log CFU/cm2 for total aerobic microorganisms, 1.8 and 3.3 log CFU/cm2 for Enterobacteriaceae, and 2.0 and 3.6 log CFU/cm2 for Escherichia coli. No correlation was found between numbers of any indicator bacteria and numbers of pathogenic bacteria. Subsets of the samples were analyzed for Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens, pathogenic Yersinia enterocolitica, and Enterococcus, resulting in prevalence estimates of 29, 18, 9 (as determined by a PCR assay), and 97%, respectively. L. monocytogenes was most common at slaughterhouses with a low prevalence of coagulase-positive staphylococci, and vice versa. These results will improve the ability of researchers to assess the importance of chicken as a source of foodborne pathogens and can serve as a basis for risk management actions.
TI  - A microbial diagnostic microarray technique for the sensitive detection and identification of pathogenic bacteria in a background of nonpathogens.
AB  - A major challenge in microbial diagnostics is the parallel detection and identification of low-bundance pathogens within a complex microbial community. In addition, a high specificity providing robust, reliable identification at least at the species level is required. A microbial diagnostic microarray approach, using single nucleotide extension labeling with gyrB as the marker gene, was developed. We present a novel concept applying competitive oligonucleotide probes to improve the specificity of the assay. Our approach enabled the sensitive and specific detection of a broad range of pathogenic bacteria. The approach was tested with a set of 35 oligonucleotide probes targeting Escherichia coli, Shigella spp., Salmonella spp., Aeromonas hydrophila, Vibrio cholerae, Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Helicobacter pylori, Proteus mirabilis, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Campylobacter jejuni. The introduction of competitive oligonucleotides in the labeling reaction successfully suppressed cross-reaction by closely related sequences, significantly improving the performance of the assay. Environmental applicability was tested with environmental and veterinary samples harboring complex microbial communities. Detection sensitivity in the range of 0.1% has been demonstrated, far below the 5% detection limit of traditional microbial diagnostic microarrays.
TI  - Rapid separation and concentration of food-borne pathogens in food samples prior  to quantification by viable-cell counting and real-time PCR.
AB  - Buoyant density gradient centrifugation has been used to separate bacteria from complex food matrices, as well as to remove compounds that inhibit rapid detection methods, such as PCR, and to prevent false-positive results due to DNA originating from dead cells. Applying a principle of buoyant density gradient centrifugation, we developed a method for rapid separation and concentration following filtration and low- and high-speed centrifugation, as well as flotation and sedimentation buoyant density centrifugation, for 12 food-borne pathogens (Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Campylobacter jejuni, Vibrio cholerae O139, Vibrio parahaemolyticus O3K6, Vibrio vulnificus, Providencia alcalifaciens, Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Clostridium perfringens) in 13 different food homogenates. This method can be used prior to real-time quantitative PCR (RTi-qPCR) and viable-cell counting. Using this combined method, the target organisms in the food samples theoretically could be concentrated 250-fold and detected at cell concentrations as low as 10(1) to 10(3) CFU/g using the RTi-qPCR assay, and amounts as small as 10(0) to 10(1) CFU/g could be isolated using plate counting. The combined separation and concentration methods and RTi-qPCR confirmed within 3 h the presence of 10(1) to 10(2) CFU/g of Salmonella and C. jejuni directly in naturally contaminated chicken and the presence of S. aureus directly in remaining food items in a poisoning outbreak. These results illustrated the feasibility of using these assays for rapid inspection of bacterial food contamination during a real-world outbreak.
TI  - Diarrhea etiology in a Children's Hospital Emergency Department: a prospective cohort study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We evaluated the frequency of recovery of pathogens from children with diarrhea who presented to a pediatric emergency department and characterized the associated illnesses, to develop guidelines for performing a bacterial enteric culture. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of all patients with diarrhea who presented to a large regional pediatric emergency department during the period from November 1998 through October 2001. A thorough microbiologic evaluation was performed on stool specimens, and the findings were correlated with case, physician, and laboratory data. RESULTS: A total of 1626 stool specimens were studied to detect diarrheagenic bacteria and, if there was a sufficient amount of stool, Clostridium difficile toxin (688 specimens), parasites (656 specimens), and viruses (417 specimens). One hundred seventy-six (47%) of 372 specimens that underwent complete testing yielded a bacterial pathogen (Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, 39 specimens [of which 28 were serotype O157:H7]; Salmonella species, 39; Campylobacter species, 25; Shigella species, 14; and Yersinia enterocolitica, 2), a viral pathogen (rotavirus, 85 specimens; astrovirus, 27; adenovirus, 18; or rotavirus and astrovirus, 8), a diarrheagenic parasite (5 specimens); or C. difficile toxin (46 specimens). Samples from 2 patients yielded both bacterial and viral pathogens. A model to identify predictors of bacterial infection found that international travel, fever, and the passing of >10 stools in the prior 24 h were associated with the presence of a bacterial pathogen. Physician judgment regarding the need to perform a stool culture was almost as accurate as the model in predicting bacterial pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly one-half of the patients who presented to the emergency department with diarrhea had a definite or plausible pathogen in their stool specimens. We were unable to develop a model that was substantially better than physician judgment in identifying patients for whom bacterial culture would yield positive results. The unexpectedly high rate of C. difficile toxin warrants further examination.
TI  - A survey of foodborne pathogens in bulk tank milk and raw milk consumption among  farm families in pennsylvania.
AB  - A 2-part study was conducted to determine the risk of exposure to human pathogens from raw milk. The first part of the study focused on determining raw milk consumption habits of dairy producers. A total of 248 dairy producers from 16 counties in Pennsylvania were surveyed. Overall, 105 (42.3%) of the 248 dairy producers consumed raw milk and 170 (68.5%) of the 248 dairy producers were aware of foodborne pathogens in raw milk. Dairy producers who were not aware of foodborne pathogens in raw milk were 2-fold more likely to consume raw milk compared with dairy producers who were aware of foodborne pathogens. The majority of dairy producers who consumed raw milk indicated that taste (72%) and convenience (60%) were the primary factors for consuming raw milk. Dairy producers who resided on the dairy farm were nearly 3-fold more likely to consume raw milk compared with those who lived elsewhere. In the second part of the study, bulk tank milk from the 248 participating dairy herds was examined for foodborne pathogens. Campylobacter jejuni (2%), Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (2.4%), Listeria monocytogenes (2.8%), Salmonella (6%), and Yersinia enterocolitica (1.2%) were detected in the milk samples. Salmonella isolates were identified as S. enterica serotype Typhimurium (n = 10) and S. enterica serotype Newport (n = 5). Of the 248 bulk tank milk samples, 32 (13%) contained > or = 1 species of bacterial pathogens. The findings of the study could assist in developing farm community-based educational programs on the risks of consuming raw milk.
TI  - Is the enthesitis-related arthritis subtype of juvenile idiopathic arthritis a form of chronic reactive arthritis?
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Enteric organisms are known to trigger reactive arthritis. The enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA) form of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) clinically resembles reactive arthritis. Therefore, we looked for a role of enteric bacteria in ERA. METHODS: Synovial fluid (SF) was obtained from 26 patients with ERA and 10 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Blood specimens were also obtained from patients with ERA and from 10 normal individuals. Lymphocyte proliferation assays were done on whole blood and SF mononuclear cells using as antigens crude lysates of the enteric bacteria Salmonella typhimurium, Yersinia enterocolitica, Shigella flexneri and Campylobacter jejuni. Crude lysate of Escherichia coli was used as a control antigen. HLA-B27 typing was done using the polymerase chain reaction. Homing of gut-specific T cells (CD103+) to the synovial compartment was studied using tri-colour flow cytometry. The antigen-specific cytokine profile was determined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Antigen-specific lymphoproliferative responses were observed in 14 of 26 patients. Among these patients, 12 showed a response in SF (four each to S. typhimurium and C. jejuni, and in two each to S. flexneri and Y. enterocolitica), and two patients in blood (S. typhimurium in both). None of the healthy controls showed a response in the blood. Lymphoproliferative responses in SF were more frequent in patients with JIA (12/26) than in controls with RA (1/10, P < 0.05). Patients with an antigen-specific response had a higher ratio of SF/blood CD103+ T cells compared with those with no antigen-specific response (P < 0.01). Antigen-specific as well as mitogen-stimulated cytokine production showed a Th1 bias. CONCLUSION: Enteric bacteria may have a role in exacerbation of disease in patients with ERA. The immune response in patients with ERA is Th1-dominant.
TI  - Population-based incidence of infection with selected bacterial enteric pathogens in children younger than five years of age, 1996-1998.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies of bacterial enteric infections have suggested a disproportionate disease burden for children younger than 5 years of age. OBJECTIVES: This study describes population-based incidence of culture-confirmed infections with 6 bacterial enteric pathogens in children younger than 5 years of age in the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet), 1996-1998. METHODS: Cases were ascertained through active laboratory-based surveillance in Minnesota, Oregon and selected counties in California, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland and New York. RESULTS: Twenty-one percent (5218 of 24,358) of infections were in children younger than 5 years of age, but this age group made up only 7% of the total person-years of observation. Among those younger than 5 years of age, the incidence (cases per 100,000 person-years) for each pathogen was: Salmonella, 55.3; Campylobacter, 43.4; Shigella, 32.7; E. coli O157, 10.3; Yersinia enterocolitica, 7.1; Listeria monocytogenes, 0.7. Incidence varied widely among the 7 FoodNet sites. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed a disproportionate disease burden in young children. Investigation of risk factors specific to this age group and review and enhancement of current prevention and control strategies for children younger than 5 years of age may reduce illness.
TI  - Detection and identification of intestinal pathogenic bacteria by hybridization to oligonucleotide microarrays.
AB  - AIM: To detect the common intestinal pathogenic bacteria quickly and accurately.  METHODS: A rapid (<3 h) experimental procedure was set up based upon the gene chip technology. Target genes were amplified and hybridized by oligonucleotide microarrays. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy strains of bacteria in pure culture belonging to 11 genera were successfully discriminated under comparatively same conditions, and a series of specific hybridization maps corresponding to each kind of bacteria were obtained. When this method was applied to 26 divided cultures, 25 (96.2%) were identified. CONCLUSION: Salmonella sp., Escherichia coli, Shigella sp., Listeria monocytogenes, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus sp., Bacillus cereus, Vibrio cholerae, Enterococcus faecalis, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Campylobacter jejuni can be detected and identified by our microarrays. The accuracy, range, and discrimination power of this assay can be continually improved by adding further oligonucleotides to the arrays without any significant increase of complexity or cost.
TI  - Foodborne bacterial infection and hospitalization: a registry-based study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Foodborne bacterial gastrointestinal infections are important causes  of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and despite successful control programs in some developed countries, these infections continue to have a major impact on public health and economy. METHODS: On the basis of data from 3 national registries, we determined short- and long-term risks of hospitalization due to gastroenteritis, short-term complications, and long-term sequelae after infections with nontyphoid Salmonella enterica, Campylobacter species, Yersinia enterocolitica, diarrheagenic Escherichia coli, and Shigella species. RESULTS: Among 52,121 patients, 7524 (14.4%) were hospitalized with a diagnosis of gastroenteritis within 90 days after microbiological diagnosis. A total of 4941 patients (17.7%) with infections due to S. enterica and 1937 (10.8%) with infections due to Campylobacter species were admitted to the hospital. Complications, such as gastrointestinal perforation and invasive illness, occurred in 647 patients (1.2%). The risk of invasive illness was > 6-fold higher in patients with infections due to S. enterica (odds ratio [OR] compared with the general population, 30.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 26.2-35.1) than in those with infections due to Campylobacter species (OR, 4.9; 95% CI, 3.5-6.8) (P < .001). Long-term sequelae were seen in 865 patients (1.7%). Among 1000 patients with infections due to S. enterica, 1820 days of hospital stay were attributable to gastroenteritis, complications, and long-term sequelae. The corresponding figure for Campylobacter infections was 714 days. CONCLUSIONS: Infections with bacteria that are usually foodborne cause considerable morbidity, in terms of severe gastroenteritis that requires admission to hospital, as well as complications and long-term sequelae. The risk of complications and sequelae depends on bacterial species, and nontyphoid Salmonella is particularly associated with a burden of severe morbidity.
TI  - Food safety knowledge of consumers and the microbiological and temperature status of their refrigerators.
AB  - The objectives of this study were to examine domestic food safety knowledge levels of consumers, establish the levels and incidence of bacterial contamination and operational temperatures in domestic refrigerators, and identify areas in which consumer food safety education is necessary in Ireland. A food safety knowledge questionnaire applied to a representative sample of households (n = 1,020) throughout the island of Ireland found the gaps in consumer food safety knowledge. Analysis of swab samples (n = 900) recovered from the domestic refrigerators in these households showed average total viable counts of 7.1 log CFU/cm2 and average total coliform counts of 4.0 log CFU/cm2. Analysis of swab samples also detected the incidence of Staphylococcus aureus (41%), Escherichia coli (6%), Salmonella enterica (7%), Listeria monocytogenes (6%), and Yersinia enterocolitica (2%). Campylobacter jejuni and E. coli O157:H7 were not detected in domestic refrigerators. The temperature profiles of a subset of the sampled refrigerators (100) were monitored for 72 h, and 59% were found to operate, on average, at temperatures above the recommended 5 degrees C. Knowledge and temperature survey results varied considerably, but consumers who scored better in terms of basic food safety knowledge had reduced levels of bacterial contamination in their refrigerators and reported a reduced incidence of food-associated illnesses. This study confirms the effect of basic food hygiene knowledge on hygienic practice and identifies specific areasfor emphasis in the development and delivery of effective food safety risk communication messages to consumers.
TI  - Rapid decay of Salmonella flagella antibodies during human gastroenteritis: a follow up study.
AB  - An indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on Salmonella re-polymerized flagella was employed to measure levels of immunoglobulin (Ig) G, IgM and IgA antibodies in sera from 303 Danish patients diagnosed with either Salmonella enteritidis or Salmonella typhimurium. The antibody-levels were assessed at one, three and six months after onset of salmonellosis, and sera from a control-group of 170 healthy blood donors were additionally analysed in order to establish cut-off values for the analysis. Cross-reactions to other Salmonella serotypes, as well as to Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli and Helicobacter pylori were observed. At one month after onset of symptoms, 70% of the patients recovering from a S. enteritidis infection carried detectable levels of anti-flagella antibodies, as did 77% of the patients recovering from S. typhimurium infection. Three months after onset of symptoms these detection rates had decreased to 46% and 40%; and six months after onset of symptoms the detection rates were 34% and 38%. This rapid decrease in the serum levels of flagella antibodies is in conflict with the "common knowledge" statement of a long-lasting anti-flagella immunoresponse. The present study suggests that such a tenacious statement is (or may be) inaccurate.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance profile of five major food-borne pathogens isolated from beef, pork and poultry.
AB  - This study was performed to evaluate the resistance rate against antimicrobials of food isolates of the five major food-borne pathogens to compare these and to possibly distinguish a pattern. A total of 922 samples of the major meat species (pork, beef and poultry) were analysed for thermophilic Campylobacter, Salmonella, Yersinia enterocolitica, pathogenic Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes. Isolates were subjected to antimicrobial resistance testing by the disc diffusion method. Roughly the same overall rate of resistance was identified for thermophilic Campylobacter, Salmonella and pathogenic E. coli. Resistance to quinolones and tetracycline was determined most frequently. In contrast, food isolates of Y. enterocolitica and L. monocytogenes were rarely tested resistant. The significance of our findings is that resistance rates in enteric bacteria seem to be much higher than in pathogens found in a variety of environments, closely associated to the host environment.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of reuterin in combination with nisin against food-borne pathogens.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of reuterin individually or in combination with nisin against different food-borne Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens in milk was investigated. Reuterin (8 AU/ml) exhibited bacteriostatic activity against Listeria monocytogenes, whereas its activity was slightly bactericidal against Staphylococcus aureus at 37 degrees C. Higher bactericidal activity was detected against Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella choleraesuis subsp. choleraesuis, Yersinia enterocolitica, Aeromonas hydrophila subsp. hydrophila and Campylobacter jejuni. A significant synergistic effect on L. monocytogenes and a slight additive effect on S. aureus after 24 h at 37 degrees C were observed when reuterin was combined with nisin (100 IU/ml). The combination of reuterin with nisin did not enhance the antimicrobial effect of reuterin against Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Application of oligonucleotide array technology for the rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria of foodborne infections.
AB  - A rapid and accurate method for detection for common pathogenic bacteria in foodborne infections was established by using oligonucleotide array technology. Nylon membrane was used as the array support. A mutation region of the 23S rRNA gene was selected as the discrimination target from 14 species (genera) of bacteria causing foodborne infections and two unrelated bacterial species. A pair of universal primers was designed for PCR amplification of the 23S rRNA gene. Twenty-one species (genera)-specific oligonucleotide detection probes were synthesized and spotted onto the nylon membranes. The 23S rRNA gene amplification products of 14 species of pathogenic bacteria were hybridized to the oligonucleotide array. Hybridization results were analyzed with digoxigenin-linked enzyme reaction. Results indicated that nine species of pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Shigella dysenteriae, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium botulinum) showed high sensitivity and specificity for the oligonucleotide array. Two other species (Salmonella enterica and Yersinia enterocolitica) gave weak cross-reaction with E. coli, but the reaction did not affect their detection. After redesigning the probes, positive hybridization results were obtained with Staphylococcus aureus, but not with Clostridium perfringens and Streptococcus pyogenes. The oligonucleotide array can also be applied to samples collected in clinical settings of foodborne infections. The superiority of oligonucleotide array over other tests lies on its rapidity, accuracy and efficiency in the diagnosis, treatment and control of foodborne infections.
TI  - Enteropathogens associated with cases of gastroenteritis in a rural population in Jordan.
AB  - Stool specimens were collected from 180 patients belonging to a population of recently settled Bedouins in Jordan who presented with acute or persistent diarrhoea and other symptoms, and from 100 non-diarrhoeal controls. All samples were examined for parasites and bacterial pathogens by culture and PCR. Bacterial isolates were tested for their susceptibility to common antimicrobial agents. Pathogens and potential enteropathogens were identified from 140 (77.8%) of the patients, with more than one pathogen being recovered from 67 (37.2%) patients. Potentially pathogenic parasites were observed in 90 (50%) patients; those that were associated significantly with diarrhoea were Giardia lamblia, Blastocystis hominis, Cryptosporidium spp., Entamoeba histolytica and Cyclospora cayetanensis. Pathogenic bacteria were isolated from 72 (40%) patients, and, of these, 62.5% were resistant to at least one antibiotic, and 30.6% of these were multiresistant. Diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli strains were found in 14.3% of the patients and 2.9% of the control subjects (not statistically significant). The most common enteropathogenic bacteria found were Shigella spp., Campylobacter jejuni and Yersinia enterocolitica. Unusual bacterial species were the predominant organisms recovered in a few cases and could represent a possible cause of diarrhoea. Overall, there was a high endemicity of diarrhoeal disease in the area studied. Risk factors that correlated significantly with contracting diarrhoea were socio-economic status, education, use of unchlorinated well or tank water, and a low level of personal hygiene.
TI  - Preliminary FoodNet data on the incidence of infection with pathogens transmitted commonly through food--selected sites, United States, 2003.
AB  - In the United States, an estimated 76 million persons contract foodborne and other acute diarrheal illnesses each year. CDC's Emerging Infections Program Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) collects data on diseases caused by enteric pathogens transmitted commonly through food in nine U.S. sites. FoodNet quantifies and monitors the incidence of these infections by conducting active surveillance for laboratory-diagnosed illness. This report describes preliminary surveillance data for 2003 and compares them with 1996-2002 data. The data indicate substantial declines in the incidence of infections caused by Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium parvum, Escherichia coli O157, Salmonella, and Yersinia enterocolitica. These data represent progress toward meeting the 2010 national health objectives of reducing the incidence of foodborne infections (objective nos. 10.1a, 10.1b, and 10.1d). However, increased efforts are needed to reduce further the incidence of foodborne illnesses, particularly among children.
TI  - Emerging food pathogens and bacterial toxins.
AB  - Many different foodborne diseases have been described. For example, Shigella bacteria, hepatitis A virus and Norwalk virus were shown as a unwashed hands microorganisms, but pathogen Campylobacter and Escherichia coli were named as raw and undercooked meat and poultry or raw milk and untreated water born bacteria. However, two of them: Listeria monocytogenes and Yersinia enterocolitica are known as growing at refrigerator temperatures. Essential virulence determinants of Listeria monocytogenes pathogenicity are well known as a bacterial toxins. Basic molecular mechanisms of pathogenicity depending from these toxins were presented. It was shown that other bacterial toxins may act as very danger food poisoning substances. This is why elimination of pathogenic microorganisms from foods is an obvious solution in some food processes, however this approach is not practical or even desirable in many processes. Thus, risk assessment and microbial monitoring will continue to play important roles in ensuring food safety. Some technological advances have the capability of delivering detection systems that can not only monitor pathogenic microorganisms, but also entire microbial populations in the food matrix.
TI  - Optimization of PCR-based methods for rapid detection of Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli and Yersinia enterocolitica serovar 0:3 in wastewater samples.
AB  - PCR-based methods were evaluated for their adequacy to assess the removal of pathogens from wastewater samples. For the development and optimization of the methods, samples were taken at two different sites from two different constructed wetlands. Campylobacter jejuni/coli and Yersinia enterocolitica serogroup 0:3 were selected as model pathogens and Enterococcus faecalis as a standard microbiological indicator. The chosen PCR protocols were optimized for wastewater DNA extracts in order to obtain high sensitivity and reproducibility independently of the background flora. All PCR protocols were successfully performed and reproducible with a background of up to 10(10) nontarget cells per reaction. Five cells of Y. enterocolitica, 50 cells of C. jejuni/coli, and 500 cells of E. faecalis per 100ml treated water could be detected. The method detection limit in the settled wastewater was higher: 200 cells per 100ml for Y. enterocolitica, 2000 cells per 100ml for C. jejuni/coli, and 20,000 cells per 100ml for E. faecalis. C. jejuni/coli and Y. enterocolitica PCRs were adapted to municipal wastewater, with higher loads of potential PCR inhibitors. Sensitivity was lower for this type of wastewater: 200 cells of Y. enterocolitica and 2000 cells of C. jejuni/coli were detected per 100ml treated wastewater, 2500 cells of Y. enterocolitica and 25,000 cells of C. jejuni/coli per 100ml settled wastewater. The developed PCR methods enable the detection of C. jejuni/coli, Y. enterocolitica serogroup 0:3 and E. faecalis within 12h. They show specificity, reproducibility and low detection limits for the investigated pathogens.
TI  - [Acute diarrhea in children less than 3 years of age: Enteropathogens isolated in patient's stools, compared with a control group]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To observe the occurrence of different etiological agents of acute diarrhea (AD) in stool specimens of patients and children in a control group. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 100 children less than three years of age with AD were studied as well as 100 controls, between November 1993 and May 1994. Stool specimens were collected in both groups and the following enteropathogens were searched for: Rotavirus, Escherichia coli (EPEC, ETEC, EIEC, EHEC), Salmonella sp, Shigella sp, Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Cryptosporidium sp, Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica. Statistical analysis using the exact Fisher test (at significance level p<0,05) was done. The mean age was 12,5 months, with more cases in patients less than 6 months (35%). Children were seen at the emergency section on an average fifth day after the start of the diarrhea. Most came from homes with basical sanitary conditions. Watery diarrhea was more frequent than bloody diarrhea with mucus, at a proportion of 4:1. RESULTS: Rotavirus was the most frequent agent: 21% in the AD group and 3% in the control group (p= 0,0001). Shigella sp was isolated in 7% of the AD group and none of the control group (p= 0,0140). EPEC was detected in 13% of AD cases and 7% in the control group (p= 0,2381) but the classical subgroups O55, O111, O119 were only isolated from the patients with AD. The other enteropathogens were infrequently detected or in equal proportion in both groups. Rotavirus and EPEC were the more frequently isolated agents in watery diarrhea, while Shigella sp was the predominant agent found in bloody stools with mucus. CONCLUSIONS: Rotavirus was the most common causative agent in AD. The detection of Rotavirus and Shigella sp nearly exclusively in patients with AD confirms the high patogenicity of these etiological agents when compared to the others. Escherichia coli (EPEC) diagnosed by polyvalent sera does not confirm its respective diarrheogenic property due to isolation in the same proportion among patients with AD and controls. Monovalent antisera made possible the detection of classical subgroups of EPEC O111, O119, O55 isolated only from AD patients, confirming the already known high patogenicity of these strains.
TI  - The Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene and emerging enteric pathogens.
AB  - At the turn of the 20th century, typhoid fever was common in Wisconsin, and was a major impetus for the establishment of the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene (WSLH) in 1903. By the 1940s, typhoid was virtually eliminated in the United States due to public health measures such as disinfection of drinking water, sewage treatment, pasteurization, and shellfish bed sanitation. However, new food and waterborne pathogens have emerged to take the place of Salmonella Typhi. Infections with non-typhoidal Salmonella strains in the United States have increased almost 10-fold since the 1950s. In the last 20 years, the emergence of foodborne pathogens, such as Escherichia coli O157:H7, Cyclospora cayetanensis, Noroviruses (Norwalk-like viruses), Cryptosporidium parvum, Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, and multi-drug-resistant Salmonella, has identified a need for accurate laboratory diagnosis of enteric disease and outbreaks.
TI  - Heat resistance in liquids of Enterococcus spp., Listeria spp., Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp.
AB  - The aim of the work was to collect, evaluate, summarize and compare heat resistance data reported for Campylobacter, Enterococcus, Escherichia, Listeria, Salmonella and Yersinia spp. The work was limited to resistance in liquids with pH values 6-8. Results obtained under similar experimental conditions were sought. Thermal destruction lines for the various bacterial groups studied were constructed using log10 D values and treatment temperatures. There was a good linear relationship between log10 D and temperature with Escherichia coli, listerias and salmonellas. For campylobacters, enterococci and yersinias the relationships were weaker but, nevertheless, present. Using the slopes of the lines and their 95% confidence limits, z values and their 95% confidence limits were calculated. z values were compared with z values obtained from reports. The equations for the lines were also used for calculation of predicted means of D values at various treatment temperatures. 95% confidence limits on predicted means of D values and on predicted individual D values were also calculated. Lines and values are shown in figures and tables. Differences in heat resistance noted between and within the bacterial groups studied are discussed.
TI  - Duplex real-time SYBR green PCR assays for detection of 17 species of food- or waterborne pathogens in stools.
AB  - A duplex real-time SYBR Green LightCycler PCR (LC-PCR) assay with DNA extraction  using the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini kit was evaluated with regard to detection of 8 of 17 species of food- or waterborne pathogens in five stool specimens in 2 h or less. The protocol used the same LC-PCR with 20 pairs of specific primers. The products formed were identified based on a melting point temperature (T(m)) curve analysis. The 17 species of food- or waterborne pathogens examined were enteroinvasive Escherichia coli, enteropathogenic E. coli, enterohemorrhagic E. coli, enterotoxigenic E. coli, enteroaggregative E. coli, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Campylobacter jejuni, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio vulnificus, Aeromonas spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, and Bacillus cereus. No interference with the LC-PCR assay was observed when stool specimens were artificially inoculated with each bacterial species. The detection levels were approximately 10(5) food- or waterborne pathogenic bacteria per g of stool. The protocol for processing stool specimens for less than 10(4) food- or waterborne pathogenic bacteria per g of stool requires an overnight enrichment step to achieve adequate sensitivity. However, the rapid amplification and reliable detection of specific genes of greater than 10(5) food- or waterborne pathogenic bacteria per g in samples should facilitate the diagnosis and management of food- or waterborne outbreaks.
TI  - Consumer food-handling behaviors associated with prevention of 13 foodborne illnesses.
AB  - To be effective in reducing the incidence of foodborne illness, consumers and food safety educators need information about behaviors that will decrease exposure to foodborne pathogens. A four-round Delphi technique was used to survey nationally recognized experts in food microbiology, epidemiology, food safety education, and food safety policy with the aim of identifying and ranking food-handling and consumption behaviors associated with 13 major foodborne pathogens. The food safety experts ranked behaviors related to keeping foods at safe temperatures as of primary importance in preventing illness caused by Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens and of secondary importance in preventing illness caused by Staphylococcus aureus. The use of a thermometer to cook foods adequately was ranked as of primary importance for the prevention of illness caused by Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella species, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Toxoplasma gondii, and Yersinia enterocolitica, with the avoidance of cross-contamination being ranked as of secondary importance for most of these pathogens. Hand washing was the top-ranked behavior for the prevention of shigellosis. The avoidance of certain foods that are likely to be contaminated was the top-ranked behavior for the prevention of illnesses caused by Listeria monocytogenes, Noroviruses, and Vibrio species. The expert panel's ranking of behaviors for the reduction of the risk of illness caused by major foodborne pathogens can enable consumers to make informed choices about food consumption and handling behaviors and can guide food safety educators in prioritizing their educational efforts.
TI  - A study of the foodborne pathogens: Campylobacter, Listeria and Yersinia, in faeces from slaughter-age cattle and sheep in Australia.
AB  - In a study of faeces from 475 slaughter-age cattle and sheep from 19 herds or flocks, Campylobacter species (C. jejuni and C. coli) were cultured from all production systems studied and from 73.7 per cent (14/19) of herds or flocks. Within individual properties there was a higher prevalence in cattle than in sheep, with Campylobacter being most commonly isolated from feedlot cattle. The median prevalences and ranges were: for dairy cattle, six per cent (0-24%), feedlot beef cattle, 58 per cent (12-92%) pasture beef cattle, two per cent (0-52%), mutton sheep, 0 per cent (0-4%) and prime lambs eight per cent. Listeria ivanovii was cultured from one dairy cow but Yersinia enterocolitica was not cultured from any animal. Campylobacter is the leading bacterial causative agent of acute diarrhoea in humans in many industrialised countries. While the role of cattle and sheep in producing human campylobacteriosis either directly or via contaminated food, remains to be epidemiologically clarified, this study suggests that the production system, particularly for cattle, may be an important consideration.
TI  - Infectious agent and immune response characteristics of chronic enterocolitis in  captive rhesus macaques.
AB  - Chronic enterocolitis is the leading cause of morbidity in colonies of captive rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). This study's aim was to identify the common enteric pathogens frequently associated with chronic enterocolitis in normal, immunocompetent rhesus monkeys and to elucidate the influence of this clinical syndrome on the host immune system. We analyzed the fecal specimens from 100 rhesus macaques with or without clinical symptoms of chronic diarrhea. Retrospective analysis revealed an increased incidence of Campylobacter spp. (Campylobacter coli and Campylobacter jejuni), Shigella flexneri, Yersinia enterocolitica, adenovirus, and Strongyloides fulleborni in samples collected from animals with chronic diarrhea (P < 0.05). The presence of additional enteric pathogens, such as Escherichia coli, carrying the eaeA intimin or Stx2c Shiga toxin virulence genes, Balantidium coli, Giardia lamblia, Enterocytozoon bieneusi, and Trichuris trichiura was found in all animals regardless of whether diarrhea was present. In addition, the upregulation of interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), IL-3, and tumor necrosis factor alpha cytokine genes, accompanied by an increased presence of activated (CD4(+) CD69(+)) T lymphocytes was found in gut-associated lymphoid tissues collected from animals with chronic enterocolitis and diarrhea in comparison with clinically healthy controls (P < 0.05). These data indicate that chronic enterocolitis and diarrhea are associated, in part, with a variety of enteric pathogens and highlight the importance of defining the microbiological status of nonhuman primates used for infectious disease studies. The data also suggest that chronic colitis in rhesus macaques may have potential as a model of inflammatory bowel disease in humans.
TI  - Identification of beta-subunit of bacterial RNA-polymerase--a non-species-specific bacterial protein--as target of antibodies in primary biliary cirrhosis.
AB  - Several observations suggest that bacteria induce autoimmunity in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). Since no PBC-specific bacterial species could be identified, it can be speculated that the triggers are non-species-specific bacterial proteins. This hypothesis would imply that several or even all bacterial species can trigger PBC. Therefore, we investigated whether PBC exhibits immune reactions to non-species-specific bacterial antigens. Yersinia enterocolitica O3 was screened for the presence of proteins that were labeled by immunoblotting using PBC sera. We focused our investigations on a 160-kDa protein, which was further enriched and characterized by partial N-terminal amino acid sequencing. The prevalence of antibodies to this protein was determined by immunoblotting in a variety of diseases. The 160-kDa protein was identified as the beta-subunit of bacterial RNA-polymerase, a highly conserved bacterial protein with a very high degree of sequence identity among all bacterial species. Antibodies to the beta-subunit of bacterial RNA polymerase were specific for this protein. Until now no mammalian protein could be found that cross-reacts with these antibodies. The prevalence of antibodies to the beta-subunit of bacterial RNA polymerase (ARPA) using the protein from Yersinia enterocolitica O3 (serum dilution 1:1000) was: healthy controls (HC, N = 101) 7.9%, primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC, N = 61) 32.8%, autoimmune hepatitis type 1 (AIH, N = 46) 26.1%, alcoholic liver cirrhosis (ALC, N = 44) 9.1%, Crohn's disease (CD, N = 38) 7.9%, ulcerative colitis (UC, N = 24) 8.3%, primary sclerosing cholangitis + UC (PSC/UC, N = 11) 0%, acute yersiniosis (Yers, N = 36) 19.4%, acute infection with Campylobacter jejuni (Camp, N = 10) 0%, acute Q-fever (QF, N = 16) 6.25%, chronic hepatitis C (HCV, N = 39) 7.7%, c-ANCA-positive vasculitis (Vasc, N = 40) 15%, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, N = 28) 10.7%, and malaria tropica (MT, N = 24) 16.7%. There was no significant difference between PBC and AIH. The group of autoimmune liver diseases (PBC + AIH, N = 107, 29.9%) differed highly significantly from HC, chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (CD + UC + PSC/UC, N = 73, 6.8%), ALC, and HCV and also differed significantly (P = 0.01) from the group with bacterial and parasitic diseases (Yers + Camp + QF + MT, N = 86,13.95%) and from the group with Vasc + SLE (N = 68,13.2%). Testing of ARPA using the protein from E. coli yielded nearly identical results. In conclusion, an increased prevalence of antibodies to the beta-subunit of bacterial RNA polymerase, a highly conserved non-species-specific bacterial protein, can be found in primary biliary cirrhosis, but also in autoimmune hepatitis type I. These findings do not add an argument for a bacterial trigger of PBC. Rather, they suggest that ARPA belong to the pool of natural antibodies that are up-regulated in autoimmune liver diseases.
TI  - A 5-year study of the bacterial pathogens associated with acute diarrhoea on the  island of Crete, Greece, and their resistance to antibiotics.
AB  - During a 5-year period (1995-1999) a total of 7090 stool samples obtained from patients with acute diarrhoea, mostly community-acquired, were examined for bacterial pathogens, in the Greek island of Crete. One or more enteric pathogens were isolated from 987 patients (14%). Salmonella enterica were the most commonly isolated bacteria (6%), followed by Campylobacter spp. (4.2%), and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) (1.8%). Yersinia enterocolitica (0.6%), Shigella spp. (0.3%), and Aeromonas hydrophila (0.04%), were less frequently isolated. Clostridium difficile was isolated from 65 out of 451 diarrhoeal specimens examined (14.4%). Toxin B was detected in all cases. No verotoxigenic E. coli strains were identified. Resistance to ampicillin was observed in 31.5% of the Salmonella, 58.3% of the Shigella and 31.5% of the EPEC isolates. Resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was observed in 4.4% of the Salmonella, 30.5% of the Shigella, and 18.5% of the EPEC isolates. High percentages of resistance to quinolones (44.5% to norfloxacin, and 40.5% to ciprofloxacin), were found among Campylobacter isolates, while resistance to erythromycin was observed in 14.9% of them. With the present study we continue the surveillance of bacterial pathogens associated with diarrhoeal disease on the island of Crete.
TI  - [Nutrition and health--infections caused by food].
AB  - The annual incidence of food-borne infections in the Netherlands is estimated to  be 250,000 or more; registration, however, is lacking. Meat, poultry, milk and eggs are contaminated primarily by intestinal animal commensals (Salmonella, Campylobacter, E. coli O157:H7, Yersinia enterocolitica) or secondarily by animals, humans and the environment during processing (typhoid fever, Shigella, Listeria, Clostridium, hepatitis A virus, Norwalk virus, parasites). The guidelines for the prevention of contamination are insufficient. Intensity of production and the economic importance of fast, large-scale production are given priority over food safety. Information fails to reach the consumer.
TI  - Emerging water-borne pathogens.
AB  - Emerging water-borne pathogens constitute a major health hazard in both developed and developing nations. A new dimension to the global epidemiology of cholera-an ancient scourge-was provided by the emergence of Vibrio cholerae O139. Also, water-borne enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli ( E. coli O157:H7), although regarded as a problem of the industrialized west, has recently caused outbreaks in Africa. Outbreaks of chlorine-resistant Cryptosporidium have motivated water authorities to reassess the adequacy of current water-quality regulations. Of late, a host of other organisms, such as hepatitis viruses (including hepatitis E virus), Campylobacter jejuni, microsporidia, cyclospora, Yersinia enterocolitica, calciviruses and environmental bacteria like Mycobacterium spp, aeromonads, Legionella pneumophila and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been associated with water-borne illnesses. This review critically examines the potential of these as emerging water-borne pathogens. It also examines the possible reasons, such as an increase in the number of immunocompromised individuals, urbanization and horizontal gene transfer, that may underlie their emergence. Further, measures required to face the challenge posed by these pathogens are also discussed.
TI  - Prevalence of bacterial faecal pathogens in separated and unseparated stored pig  slurry.
AB  - AIMS: To examine the prevalence and diversity of bacterial faecal pathogens in unseparated slurry, separated solids and liquid fractions from a commercial pig farm. METHODS: A total of 43 stored slurry specimens originating from a fattening house over the period February-April 2002 were analysed, consisting of unseparated (n = 14) slurry, separated solids (n = 16) and separated liquid (n = 13). Specimens were examined for the presence of five bacterial pathogens including Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Campylobacter spp., Escherichia coli O157 and Yersinia enterocolitica. Selective enrichment and plating methods were employed for detection of Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp. and conventional selective plating techniques for the remaining genera. Antibiogram profiles to 12 antibiotic agents were obtained for all Salmonella isolates obtained. RESULTS: Salmonella spp. were identified in all components of the slurry specimens, whereas Campylobacter spp. was only recovered from the unseparated and separated liquid fractions. In both cases, the separated liquid fraction had the highest prevalence of pathogens and the separated solid fraction had the lowest prevalence. None of the slurry specimens examined were positive for E. coli O157:H7, Shigella spp. or Y. enterocolitica. Twenty-nine isolates of Salmonella were recovered from the slurry specimens, comprising seven serovars, of which Salmonella manhattan was the most prevalent, accounting for over half [15 of 29 (51.7%)] of all Salmonella isolates. Salmonella anatum, Salm. derby, Salm. give, Salm. heidelberg, Salm. simi and Salm. stanley serovars were also recovered. All Salmonella isolates were sensitive to ampicillin, augmentin (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid), chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, kanamycin and trimethoprim, but has variable resistance to tetracycline (100%), sulphonamides (84.6%), furazolidone (38.5%), nalidixic acid (15.4%) and streptomycin (15.4%). The majority (57.7%) of isolates displayed antibiotic resistance to at least two antibiotic agents, followed by 34.6% of isolates being resistant to three agents and the remainder (7.7%) being resistant to four antibiotics. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study demonstrated a marked reduction in the prevalence of Campylobacter and Salmonella in the solids component of separated pig slurry. The adoption of control processes such as aeration of slurry prior to its spread onto agricultural land and newer approaches to pathogen reduction should be investigated, to reduce the transmission of pathogens from pig slurry to the environment.
TI  - Occurrence of Yersinia enterocolitica and Campylobacter spp. in slaughter pigs and consequences for meat inspection, slaughtering, and dressing procedures.
AB  - The purpose of the present investigation was to assess the occurrence of Yersinia enterocolitica and Campylobacter spp. in the lymphoid tissues and intestinal tract in pigs and the risk for contamination during the compulsory meat inspection procedures and the procedures during slaughtering and dressing. Another objective of the investigation was to compare traditional isolation methods, the use of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method (BUGS'n BEADS bacterial DNA isolation kit) and an ELISA method (VIDAS CAM) as tools in risk management in the slaughterhouse. The results indicate that the compulsory procedure for the incision of the submaxillary lymph nodes represents a cross-contamination risk for virulent Yersinia. In the screening of 97 animals in 1999, 5.2% of the samples were positive, and by the sampling of 24 samples in 2000-2001, 12.5% of the samples were positive. In the last case, Y. enterocolitica O:3 was found in the kidney region in one of the subsequent carcasses that was only touched by the meat inspection personnel before sampling. In addition, incision of the mesenteric lymph nodes might represent a cross-contamination risk since 8.3% of the samples were positive. The association between antibody titres and the occurrence of virulent yersiniae in the tonsils (21-18) was striking, with virulent yersiniae found in the tonsils in most pigs with high titres. The contents of the stomach, ileum, caecum, and colon also represent contamination risks for Y. enterocolitica O:3 if the slaughterhouse personnel cuts into the viscera with their knives by accident; the frequency of virulent Yersinia varied from 4.2% to 16.7% within these sections. Campylobacter was detected in the gastrointestinal tract of all pigs, and the high contamination of tonsils (66.7%) and intestinal tract (100%) might represent an occupational health hazard. There was no statistical difference between the traditional method for isolation of Y. enterocolitica [International Organization for Standardization, 1994. Microbiology-General Guidance for the Detection of Presumptive Pathogenic Yersinia enterocolitica (ISO 10273). International Organization for Standardization, Geneve, Switzerland (16 pp.)] and the BUGS'n BEADS detection method for virulent Y. enterocolitica. Likewise, there was no statistical difference between the traditional method for isolation of Campylobacter spp. [Nordic Committee on Food Analysis, 1990. Campylobacter jejuni/coli. Detection in Food. Method No. 119, 2nd ed. Nordic Committee on Food Analysis, Esbo (7 pp.)] and the BUGS'n BEADS detection method or the VIDAS CAM method for detection of Campylobacter spp.
TI  - Studies on enteric campylobacteriosis in Tikur Anbessa and Ethio-Swedish children's hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
AB  - Between February 1992 and January 1993 different Campylobacter spp. were isolated from 86 (13.7%) of 630 patients with diarrhoea at Tikur Anbessa and Ethio-Swedish Children's Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. In the same study population, Shigella spp. were found in 11.7% and Salmonella spp. in 3.8%. Campylobacter spp. were found in all age groups, but the majority were isolated from children less than five years of age (68.6%). Only 2 (0.9%) of 220 controls had campylobacter in their stools. Of the campylobacters that were differentiated at species level, Campylobacter jejuni accounted for 82.4% and Campylobacter coli for 17.6% of the isolates. Yersinia enterocolitica was not isolated from any tested stool specimen. More patients (53.1%) presented for investigation of diarrhoea during the months of April through July than during other parts of the year but there was no significant difference in the frequency of isolation of the three enteric pathogens studied during this period as compared to other months of the year. In 12 of the patients infected with Campylobacter spp., Shigella spp. or Salmonella spp. was concomitantly isolated from their stools. The most common symptoms and signs in both adults and children were watery diarrhoea in 82.4%, low grade fever in 78.4% and frequent vomiting in 45.9%. Dehydration ranging from mild to severe was observed in 25.4% of the 55 children with campylobacter infections. Of the 55 children 67.2% had signs of malnutrition and most of them (47.2%) were underweight. This study indicates that Campylobacter spp. are an important cause of diarrhoea both in adults and children in Addis Ababa, and should be considered routinely in the diagnosis of patients with diarrhoea.
TI  - Prevalence of foodborne pathogens in bulk tank milk.
AB  - Bulk tank milk from 131 dairy herds in eastern South Dakota and western Minnesota was examined for the presence of for foodborne pathogens. Campylobacter jejuni, shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., and Yersinia enterocolitica were detected in 9.2, 3.8, 4.6, 6.1, and 6.1% of bulk tank milk samples, respectively. Thirty-five of 131 (26.7%) bulk tank milk samples contained one or more species of pathogenic bacteria. Isolates of Salmonella belonged to group D (n = 4), B (n = 2), C (n = 1), and E (n = 1) "O" serogroups. All six isolates of Listeria monocytogenes were identified as O antigen type 1. Four of five isolates of E. coli encoded for the shiga-toxin 2 gene, while one strain encoded for the shiga-toxin 1 gene. Escherichia coli O157:H7 was not isolated from bulk tank milk samples. Based on autoagglutination testing, it was inferred that all eight isolates of Yersinia enterocolitica were likely to be virulent. Non A-grade (manufacturing grade) raw milk producers were at a higher risk (odd's ratio, 4.98; confidence interval, 1.96 to 12.22) of having one or more pathogens in their bulk tank milk than were Grade A producers. It was observed that 21 of 79 (26.6%) dairy producers who consumed raw milk had one or more pathogenic bacteria in their bulk tank milk. The findings of the study warrant the need for educational programs for dairy producers about the risks associated with consumption of raw milk.
TI  - Acute diarrhoea in children treated in an outpatient setting in Athens, Greece.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiology and aetiology of acute diarrhoea among children treated exclusively in an outpatient setting in Greece. METHODS: During 1999, children with acute diarrhoea who attended the emergency department of our hospital were prospectively studied. Patients requiring hospitalization were excluded. Stool specimens were tested microscopically, for bacterial enteropathogens by standard and selective medium cultures and for rotavirus and adenovirus by latex agglutination test. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-two children (median age: 2 years) were included in the study; an enteropathogen was detected in 63 (48%) of them. Isolates included rotavirus (19 patients), Salmonella sp (12), Campylobacter sp (10), Aeromonas sp (9), enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (6), adenovirus (6), Giardia lamblia (4), Yersinia enterocolitica (2) and Shigella sp (1). Half of the bacterial cases occurred from August to October, and two rotavirus-associated peaks occurred during February and August. Acute diarrhoea caused by viruses affected exclusively children under six years of age, mainly those attending day care centres. Macroscopic blood in stools was reported only among patients with a bacterial infection. Socioeconomic characteristics were not helpful in differentiating disease due to specific enteropathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial enteropathogens account for a significant proportion of acute diarrhoea in children treated in the outpatient setting in Greece. Rotavirus is also a frequent cause affecting mostly younger children and those attending day care centers. The presence of blood in stools and the seasonality of bacterial infections may enable their presumptive diagnosis.
TI  - Epidemiology, clinical course and impact on hospitalization costs of acute diarrhea among hospitalized children in Athens, Greece.
AB  - The aim of this study was to describe the etiology, morbidity and hospitalization costs associated with acute diarrhea among hospitalized children in Greece. During 1999, 294 hospitalized children (median age 1 y) with acute diarrhea were prospectively studied. Bacterial and viral enteropathogens were detected in 100 (34%) and 37 (12.5%) patients, respectively; 17 (6%) patients had mixed infections. Isolated agents included Salmonella spp. (43 patients; 15%), rotavirus (32; 11%), Campylobacter spp. (26; 9%), enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (16; 5.5%), Shigella spp. (11; 4%), Aeromonas spp. (7; 2.5%), adenovirus (6; 2%), Yersinia enterocolitica (6; 2%), enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (2; 0.5%) and Giardia lamblia (1; 0.5%). Of the patients with bacterial infection, 70% were admitted between April and September 1999. A rotavirus-associated peak was noted in March. Patients with a bacterial infection were hospitalized for longer periods than those with viral infections. It is concluded that bacterial enteropathogens account for one-third of admissions due to acute diarrhea among children in Greece and are associated with significant hospitalization costs. Rotavirus is also a frequent cause of acute diarrhea necessitating hospitalization.
TI  - A longitudinal study on enteropathogenic infections of livestock in Trinidad.
AB  - A longitudinal study was conducted on selected livestock farms to determine the prevalence of enteropathogens in diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic animals. The enteropathogens assayed from faecal samples and rectal swabs were bacteria (Escherichia coli, Campylobacter spp. Salmonella spp. and Yersinia enterocolitica), parasites (coccidia, gastrointestinal nematodes and Cryptosporidium spp.) and viruses (group A rotavirus and parvovirus). The prevalence of the enteropathogens in various animal species was related to age and month of the year. Generally, younger animals presented a higher prevalence of infection by enteropathogens than older animals while most infections occurred between the months of January and April.
TI  - Foodborne diseases in Kenya.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the occurrence of foodborne disease outbreaks in Kenya and the efforts employed to combat them. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Forty two districts in Kenya between 1970 and 1993. STUDY SUBJECTS: Foodborne disease outbreak episodes due to Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium botulinum, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Listera monocytogenes, chemicals, aflatoxin, plant and animal poisons. OUTCOME MEASURES: Number and aetiological causes of foodborne disease outbreaks reported in the study period. RESULTS: Thirty seven food poisoning outbreaks were reported to the Ministry of Health from various parts of the country in the study period 1970 to 1993, and only 13 of these involving a total of 926 people were confirmed to be due to particular aetiological agents. Foods that were involved included milk and milk products, meat and meat products, maize flour, bread, scones and other wheat products, vegetables and lemon pie pudding. A high number of food poisoning cases were treated as outpatients in various health facilities. CONCLUSION: Under-reporting, inadequate investigation of outbreaks and inadequate diagnostic facilities suggest that foodborne disease outbreaks are more than is recorded by the Ministry of Health.
TI  - Extent of microbial contamination in United States pork retail products.
AB  - To determine the extent of microbiological contamination of U.S. pork, 384 samples of retail pork were collected from 24 stores in six cities, including (i) whole-muscle, store-packaged pork; (ii) fresh, store-packaged ground pork and/or pork sausage; (iii) prepackaged ground pork and/or pork sausage; and (iv) whole-muscle, enhanced (injected or marinated; 60% store-packaged, 40% prepackaged) pork. Additional samples (n = 120) of freshly ground pork and/or pork sausage were collected from two hot-boning sow/boar sausage plants, two slaughter and fabrication plants, and two further-processing plants. Samples were analyzed for aerobic plate counts (APC), total coliform counts (TCC), Escherichia coli counts (ECC), and incidences of Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Mean log APC and TCC were highest (P < 0.05) for store-ground pork, while whole-muscle, enhanced products and prepackaged ground products had the lowest (P < 0.05) APC. Mean log APC and TCC were higher (P < 0.05) in samples from the slaughter and fabrication plants than in samples from hot-boning and further processing plants. Mean log ECC were lower (P < 0.05) in samples from further-processing plants compared to slaughter and fabrication plants and hot-boning, sow and boar sausage plants. L. monocytogenes was detected in 26.7% of plant samples and 19.8% of retail samples and was present more frequently in ground products. Y. enterocolitica was detected most often in whole-muscle, store-packaged cuts (19.8%) and in store-ground product (11.5%). Salmonella spp. were found in 9.6% of retail samples and 5.8% of plant samples, while C. jejuni and C. coli were found in 1.3% of retail samples and 6.7% of plant samples. Pork products exposed to the most handling and processing appeared to be of the poorest microbiological quality. These results should be useful in risk assessments that are directed at the identification of actions that could enhance food safety.
TI  - Uptake pathways of clinical and healthy animal isolates of Campylobacter jejuni into INT-407 cells.
AB  - Campylobacter jejuni isolates obtained from human and animal sources showed different invasion levels into human embryonic intestinal (INT-407) cells. There was no significant relation between the degree of invasion and cytotoxins production. The depolymerization of both microfilaments by cytochalasin-D and microtubules by colchicine, demecolcine and nocodazole or stabilization of microtubules by paclitaxel reduced the invasiveness of C. jejuni, although microfilament depolymerization showed greater inhibition than microtubule depolymerization. Interference with receptor-mediated endocytosis by G-strophanthin and monodansylcadaverine and inhibition of endosome acidification by monensin reduced the number of viable intracellular C. jejuni cells. Furthermore inhibition of only host protein kinases by staurosporine, but not phosphoinositide 3-kinase by wortmannin or protein kinase-C by calphostin-C, significantly reduced invasion of epithelial cells by C. jejuni. These data suggest that the internalization mechanism triggered by C. jejuni is strikingly different from the microfilament-dependent invasion mechanism exhibited by many of the well-studied enteric bacteria such as enteroinvasive strains of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Yersinia enterocolitica and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis.
TI  - Bacterial, viral and parasitic enteric pathogens associated with acute diarrhea in hospitalized children from northern Jordan.
AB  - To determine the etiology of acute diarrhea in Jordanian children under 5 years of age, we examined stool samples from 265 children admitted to the pediatric ward at Princess Rahma Hospital for Children, Irbid, Jordan, for parasites, rotavirus and enteric bacteria. Using both traditional and molecular diagnostic techniques, we detected enteropathogens in 66.4% of patients with diarrhea. A single enteric pathogen was detected in 50.9% of the children, and multiple pathogens were detected in 15.5%. The prevalence of enteropathogens identified was as follows: rotavirus (32.5%), enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (12.8%), enteroaggregative E. coli (10.2), enterotoxigenic E. coli (5.7%), Shigella spp. (4.9%), Entamoeba histolytica (4.9%), Salmonella spp. (4.5%), Campylobacter jejuni/coli (1.5%), Cryptosporidium spp. (1.5%), enteroinvasive E. coli (1.5%), eae-, Ehly-positive E. coli (0.8%), Giardia lamblia (0. 8%) and Yersinia enterocolitica (0.4%). No Vibrio cholerae, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, microsporidia, adenovirus or small round virus were detected. Findings from this study demonstrate that rotavirus and several types of diarrheagenic E. coli, which are not screened for during routine examinations of stool samples in public health laboratories, were the most frequently detected enteropathogens in these children. Our findings highlight the value of using a combination of traditional and molecular techniques in the diagnosis of diarrheal disease in this population.
TI  - Some emerging food and water borne pathogens.
AB  - Emerging pathogens are those infective organisms whose incidence has recently increased or is likely to increase during the next two decades due to changes in demography, food habits, food technology, commerce, water sources and environmental factors. Some important emerging food and water borne bacterial pathogens include Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella enteritidis, Escherichia coli O157: H7, Vibrio cholerae biotype E1 Tor Serotype 0139, Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Aeromonas hydrophila, A. sobria, and A. caviae. The prevalence, ecological relationships of these organisms, their transmission through food, water and other environmental sources, and role of their virulent factors in the pathogenesis of infections and their public health significance is discussed in this paper with special reference to the situation in India.
TI  - Microbiological quality and safety of ready-to-eat street-vended foods in Johannesburg, South Africa.
AB  - Fifty-one ready-to-eat street foods, 18 dishwater, and 18 surface swab samples were collected from six vendors in Johannesburg, South Africa. Food temperatures were recorded at the time of sampling. Standard methods were used to determine aerobic plate counts (APCs), spore counts (SCs), and Enterobacteriaceae counts (ECs) for food samples as well as coliform counts (CCs) for water and swab samples. In addition, Petrifilm Escherichia coli count (PC) plates were used for the enumeration of coliforms in food, water, and swab samples. The presence of selected foodborne pathogens in the food samples as well as the presence of nonpathogenic E. coli 1 (in food and water samples) was also tested for. Predominant colonies isolated from APC plates were characterized to the genus level. Holding temperatures for cooked meats and gravies ranged from 42.0 to 94.0 degrees C, and those for uncooked salads ranged from 29.0 to 39.0 degrees C. Mean APC values of 3.4 (+/-0.4) log CFU/g, 4.0 (+/-1.2) log CFU/ml, and 2.1 (+/-0.4) log CFU/25 cm2 were obtained for food, water, and swab samples, respectively. Mean SC values of 1.6 (+/-0.2) log CFU/g and 1.5 (+/-0.3) log CFU/25 cm2 were obtained for food and swab samples, respectively. A mean EC value of 2.0 (+/-0.4) log CFU/g for food samples and mean CC values of 2.5 (+/-0.3) log CFU/ml and 1.3 (+/-0.3) log CFU/25 cm2 for water and swab samples, respectively, were determined. Mean PC values of 1.6 (+/-0.1) log CFU/g, 1.9 (+/-0.6) log CFU/ml, and 1.4 (+/-0.4) log CFU/25 cm2 were determined for food, water, and swab samples, respectively. Bacillus cereus was detected in 22%, Clostridium perfringens in 16%, Salmonella spp. in 2%, and E. coli (non-O157:H+) in 2% of the 51 food samples. E. coli was found in 14 water samples (78%) and in 3 food samples (6%). Campylobacter spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio cholerae, and Yersinia enterocolitica were also tested for in the food samples, but they were not detected. The 340 isolates obtained from APC plates for food, water, and swab samples were predominantly Bacillus spp., Micrococcus spp., and Staphylococcus spp. for all three sample types. It was concluded that the foods analyzed in this study were of acceptable quality and safety.
TI  - Impact of simple screening criteria on utilization of low-yield bacterial stool cultures in a Children's Hospital.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine diagnostic yield of stool cultures for Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Escherichia coli O157:H7 (SSCYE) among hospitalized children and to develop guidelines for appropriate use of these tests. Setting. Tertiary care pediatric hospital. DESIGN: Computerized records from the Microbiology Laboratory from January 1992 to December 1996 were reviewed retrospectively to collect data on the number of stool cultures performed in inpatients and outpatients, the length of hospital stay at the time cultures were sent, and diagnostic yield of cultures in hospitalized patients. A detailed review of medical records of all patients with a stool pathogen isolated after 3 days of hospitalization was also undertaken. The results from this retrospective analysis were used to develop guidelines to reduce unwarranted stool cultures and to educate medical care providers in the appropriate use of these tests. The impact of these guidelines on reduction in the volume of stool cultures performed on hospitalized patients was measured prospectively from January 1998 to June 1998. RESULTS: A total of 27 110 stool cultures for SSCYE were performed in the 5-year study period. Of the 14 125 cultures from inpatients, 174 (1.2%) were positive. Among the cultures from inpatients, 9378 (66%) were from patients hospitalized for >3 days. Only 13 (.14%) were positive. Of these 13 cultures, 4 represented nosocomial infections, whereas the remaining 9 cultures either were sent to document clearance from a patient known previously to be infected with an enteric pathogen (7), or were attributed to delayed testing in individuals admitted with a diarrheal illness (2). Introduction of guidelines to reject all SSCYE cultures from patients hospitalized for >3 days who did not meet specified criteria was associated with an overall reduction of 689 (43%) in the volume of tests performed in the 6-month period evaluated. This included 497 fewer cultures ordered and 192 cultures that were ordered but rejected because screening criteria were not met. Only 11 (5.4%) of 203 cultures sent >3 days after admission were processed because they met clinical criteria for testing. None were positive. Estimated cost savings were $50 163/year. CONCLUSIONS: Stool cultures for SSCYE among hospitalized patients have very low diagnostic yield and are extremely overutilized. Simple guidelines, such as rejecting (with few exceptions) cultures from patients hospitalized for >3 days, can reduce substantially such unnecessary testing.
TI  - Resistance to antimicrobial agents used for animal therapy in pathogenic-, zoonotic- and indicator bacteria isolated from different food animals in Denmark: a baseline study for the Danish Integrated Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring Programme (DANMAP).
AB  - This study describes the establishment and first results of a continuous surveillance system of antimicrobial resistance among bacteria isolated from pigs, cattle and broilers in Denmark. The three categories of bacteria tested were: 1) indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium), 2) zoonotic bacteria (Campylobacter coli/jejuni, Salmonella enterica, Yersinia enterocolitica), and 3) animal pathogens (E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus hyicus, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae). A total of 3304 bacterial isolates collected from October 1995 through December 1996 were tested for susceptibility to all major classes of antimicrobial agents used for therapy in Denmark. Bacterial species intrinsically resistant to an antimicrobial were not tested towards that antimicrobial. Acquired resistance to all antimicrobials was found. The occurrence of resistance varied by animal origin and bacterial species. In general, resistance was observed more frequently among isolates from pigs than from cattle and broilers. The association between the occurrence of resistance and the consumption of the antimicrobial is discussed, as is the occurrence of resistance in other countries. The results of this study show the present level of resistance to antimicrobial agents among a number of bacterial species isolated from food animals in Denmark. Thus, the baseline for comparison with future prospective studies has been established, enabling the determination of trends over time.
TI  - Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from food animals to antimicrobial growth promoters and related therapeutic agents in Denmark.
AB  - This study was conducted to describe the occurrence of acquired resistance to antimicrobials used for growth promotion among bacteria isolated from swine, cattle and poultry in Denmark. Resistance to structurally related therapeutic agents was also examined. Three categories of bacteria were tested: 1) indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium), 2) zoonotic bacteria (Campylobacter, Salmonella, Yersinia enterocolitica), and 3) animal pathogens (E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus hyicus, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae). All antimicrobials used as growth promoters in Denmark and some structurally related therapeutic agents (in brackets) were included: Avilamycin, avoparcin (vancomycin), bacitracin, carbadox, flavomycin, monensin, olaquindox, salinomycin, spiramycin (erythromycin, lincomycin), tylosin (erythromycin, lincomycin), and virginiamycin (pristinamycin). Bacterial species intrinsically resistant to an antimicrobial were not tested towards that antimicrobial. Breakpoints for growth promoters were established by population distribution of the bacteria tested. A total of 2,372 bacterial isolates collected during October 1995 to September 1996 were included in the study. Acquired resistance to all currently used growth promoting antimicrobials was found. A frequent occurrence of resistance were observed to avilamycin, avoparcin, bacitracin, flavomycin, spiramycin, tylosin and virginiamycin, whereas resistance to carbadox, monensin, olaquindox and salinomycin was less frequent. The occurrence of resistance varied by animal origin and bacterial species. The highest levels of resistance was observed among enterococci, whereas less resistance was observed among zoonotic bacteria and bacteria pathogenic to animals. The association between the occurrence of resistance and the consumption of the antimicrobial is discussed. The results show the present level of resistance to growth promoters in bacteria from food animals in Denmark. They will form the baseline for comparison with future prospective studies, thereby enabling the determination of trends over time.
TI  - Enteric bacterial pathogens in stools of residents of urban and rural regions in  Nigeria: a comparison of patients with and without diarrhoea and controls without diarrhoea.
AB  - A total of 2,400 stool samples comprising 1,200 from patients with diarrhoea (600 each from urban and rural area) and 1,200 similarly divided controls were obtained from school children and clinic attendants of government and private clinics around three designated study centres of Edo, Lagos and Cross River states, Nigeria. These were screened for the prevalence of bacteria that could cause diarrhoea. Diarrhoea cases in urban areas had a high prevalence rate for Campylobacter spp. (28%), followed by enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (22%), Salmonella spp. (17%), Shigella spp. (14%), Aeromonas spp. (5%), and Yersinia enterocolitica (4%), whereas in rural areas E. coli was the most frequently encountered pathogen (18%), followed by Salmonella spp. (16%), Aeromonas spp. (15%), Shigella spp. (9%), Campylobacter spp. (8%), and Plesiomonas shigelloides (8%). A similar distribution but with lower rates was noted for controls in both urban and rural areas, however, no P. shigelloides was isolated. Results highlight a possible difference between the prevalence of enteric bacteria in rural and urban areas and reveals the strong association of Aeromonas and Plesiomonas species with cases of diarrhoea in Nigeria.
TI  - Enterobacterial antibodies in Chinese patients with rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the role of microbial infection in rheumatic diseases. METHODS: Sera from 39 Chinese patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 52 patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and 51 healthy subjects (HS) were examined for IgG, IgA, and IgM class antibodies against Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella typhimurium and enteritidis, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Klebsiella pneumoniae (capsular serotypes 31 and 43), using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: In patients with RA, IgA class antibodies against all bacterial strains used as the antigen were increased when compared to healthy controls. In patients with AS, significantly elevated IgA levels were observed against Campylobacter and Klebsiella K43. IgM class antibodies were less frequently elevated in RA and in AS than IgA class antibodies. In RA patients, IgG antibodies against Klebsiella K43 and Proteus were significantly increased. No differences were observed in IgG class antibodies between AS patients and healthy controls. CONCLUSION: Increases in serum bacterial antibodies in RA and AS suggest that in both diseases stimulation of the intestinal immune system by enterobacteria may have a role. However, the question whether this phenomenon is due to increased intestinal permeability and/or represents cross reactions between different enterobacteria remains open.
TI  - Bacterial pathogens associated with diarrhoea on the island of Crete.
AB  - Stool specimens from 3,600 diarrhoeal patients from the island of Crete, Greece,  were examined for bacterial pathogens, during a three-year period (1992-1994). One or more pathogens were identified in 826 patients (22.9%), more often from children. Salmonella spp. were the most frequently isolated organisms in 13.6% of the patients, followed by Campylobacter in 4.7%, and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) in 3.9%. Yersinia enterocolitica was found in 0.7%, Shigella spp. in 0.7% and Aeromonas hydrophila in 0.05%. Vibrio spp. and enterohaemorragic E. coli were not identified in the stools tested. Resistance to ampicillin was observed in 36% of the Salmonella, 62% of the Shigella, and 27% of the EPEC isolates. Cotrimoxazole resistance was observed in 42% of the Shigella and 12% of the EPEC isolates, while tetracycline and the quinolones were inactive against almost half and erythromycin against 20% of the Campylobacter isolates. This is the first study investigating bacterial pathogens associated with diarrhoea on the island of Crete.
TI  - Species, biotype and serogroup of Campylobacter spp. isolated from children with  diarrhoea over a ten-year period.
AB  - From 1981 to 1990, stool samples from 6403 gastroenteritis cases were examined for the presence of campylobacters as well as Salmonella, Shigella, Aeromonas species and Yersinia enterocolitica. The percentages of isolation were the following: campylobacters 10.8 (86.1% of isolates were C. jejuni and 13.9% were C. coli), Salmonella spp. 8.4, Aeromonas spp 1.4, Yersinia enterocolitica 0.3. Shigella spp. were isolated only occasionally. Predominant biotypes of campylobacters were C. jejuni I (69.5%), C. jejuni II (29.5%) and C. coli I (92.7%). The six most common LIO serogroups-36; 4; 1; 28.53; 11; 2-accounted for 50% ca. of typable strains. Campylobacters are the most common etiological agent of bacterial enteritis in children living in this area of Tuscany. The species and serogroup determination can be useful from an epidemiological point of view.
TI  - Historical overview of key issues in food safety.
AB  - Foodborne transmission of pathogenic and toxigenic microorganisms has been a recognized hazard for decades. Even half a century ago we knew about the dangers of botulism from underprocessed canned foods; staphylococcal poisoning from unrefrigerated cream-filled pastries, sliced ham, meat, and poultry salads; and salmonellosis from infected animal products. Despite new protective measures, changes in preservation techniques and failure to follow recognized procedures have created new dangers. Moreover, we now recognize new organisms that can cause foodborne illness--Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Campylobacter jejuni, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Yersinia enterocolitica, and others. Controlling these organisms will require widespread education and possibly new regulatory initiatives.
TI  - Emerging foodborne diseases: an evolving public health challenge.
AB  - The epidemiology of foodborne disease is changing. New pathogens have emerged, and some have spread worldwide. Many, including Salmonella, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Campylobacter, and Yersinia enterocolitica, have reservoirs in healthy food animals, from which they spread to an increasing variety of foods. These pathogens cause millions of cases of sporadic illness and chronic complications, as well as large and challenging outbreaks over many states and nations. Improved surveillance that combines rapid subtyping methods, cluster identification, and collaborative epidemiologic investigation can identify and halt large, dispersed outbreaks. Outbreak investigations and case-control studies of sporadic cases can identify sources of infection and guide the development of specific prevention strategies. Better understanding of how pathogens persist in animal reservoirs is also critical to successful long-term prevention. In the past, the central challenge of foodborne disease lay in preventing the contamination of human food with sewage or animal manure. In the future, prevention of foodborne disease will increasingly depend on controlling contamination of feed and water consumed by the animals themselves.
TI  - Is undifferentiated seronegative spondyloarthropathy a forme fruste of reactive arthritis?
AB  - Undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy (USpa) may either represent a forme fruste of other spondyloarthropathies like reactive arthritis or be a different disease entity. To study the link between USpa and reactive arthritis, we studied the presence of IgA antibodies to Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Campylobacter jejuni and Chlamydia trachomatis in sera from 14 patients with USpa (European Spondyloarthropathy Study Group criteria) using ELISA. Escherichia coli was used as a control antigen. An OD value of more than the mean +/- 2 S.D. of 51 blood donors was considered positive. Five patients had elevated IgA antibodies to S. flexneri, while two patients each had elevated antibody levels to S. typhimurium and Chlamydia. No patient had elevated antibodies to Y. enterocolitica, C. jejuni and E. coli. Among 51 normals, 1, 4, 3, 2 and 3 had elevated antibodies to S. flexneri, S. typhimurium, Y. enterocolitica, C. jejuni and E. coli, respectively. Nine of 14 patients with USpa had antibodies to one of the bacteria implicated in reactive arthritis: of these, antibodies to Shigella were the most frequent. Thus, a proportion of patients with USpa may in fact have reactive arthritis.
TI  - Public health and pork and pork products: regional perspectives of Denmark.
AB  - An ambitious programme to eliminate pork as an important source of human salmonellosis was initiated in Denmark in 1993 by the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries. The programme comprises control of feedmills, breeding and multiplying herds, slaughter herds and slaughter plants, as well as the final product, fresh pork. As a consequence, the level of occurrence of Salmonella spp. in fresh pork produced in Denmark is approximately 1%. Yersinia enterocolitica 0:3 infections are common in slaughter pig herds in Denmark, and pork is considered to be the only source of human infection in the country. The incidence of pork-related occurrences of human salmonellosis and yersiniosis in 1996 was approximately nine cases per 100,000 inhabitants for both diseases. All swine in Denmark are screened for Trichinella spp. infection, although no positive results have been obtained since 1930. Swine are not considered to be a source for Campylobacter jejuni or enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli in Denmark. Listeria monocytogenes can be detected in relatively high rates in pork: however, the incidence of human listeriosis is only 0.5 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. Toxoplasma gondii antibodies have been demonstrated in 3% of slaughter pigs, though the importance of pork as a source of infection is probably very low. Denmark is officially free from Brucella abortus, B. melitensis and Mycobacterium bovis.
TI  - Microbiological composition of raw milk from selected farms in the Camembert region of Normandy.
AB  - Raw milk from 27 farms was sampled over 6 months for listerias, salmonellas, Yersinia enterocolitica and campylobacters. Total bacterial counts and somatic cell counts were measured. Lactococci, lactobacilli, dextran-producing leuconostocs, Brevibacterium linens, yeasts and moulds, Staphylococcus aureus and other Micrococcaceae, Pseudomonas, coliforms, Escherichia coli, enterococci, Clostridium perfringens and spores of anaerobic lactate-fermenting bacteria were also counted. Pseudomonas (2000 cfu ml-1), lactococci (760 cfu ml-1) and Micrococcaceae (720 cfu ml-1) were the most numerous groups. Lactic acid bacteria were detected in all samples. Coliforms were present in most samples, but 84% of samples had counts < 100 cfu ml-1. Staphylococcus aureus was detected in 62% of milks, the average count was 410 cfu ml-1. About 80% of supplies had < or = 10 E. coli cfu ml-1 and all samples had < or = 1 Cl. perfringens cfu ml-1. Two of the tested milks were positive for salmonellas (2.9%), four were positive for Listeria monocytogenes (5.8%), 25 for Yersinia enterocolitica (36%) and one for campylobacters (1.4%).
TI  - Infectious diarrhoea--an update.
AB  - Infectious diarrhoea is one of the most common illness affecting mankind. Recent  advancement have led to detailed understanding of causative agents and the pathogenesis of the infections. Fluid and electrolyte replacement remains the most important aspect of treatment. The role of antimicrobial agents is discussed.
TI  - Nested polymerase chain reaction strategy simultaneously targeting DNA sequences  of multiple bacterial species in inflammatory joint diseases. I. Screening of synovial fluid samples of patients with spondyloarthropathies and other arthritides.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bacteria play a crucial pathogenetic role in Lyme arthritis (LA), reactive arthritis (ReA), other forms of spondyloarthropathy (SpA), and possibly in undifferentiated oligoarthritis (uOligo). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology has been applied to detect bacterial DNA of individual microbes in synovial fluid (SF) of patients with arthritides. We screened for DNA sequences of 8 bacterial species simultaneously in SF of patients with inflammatory joint disease. METHODS: We examined 104 SF samples of 96 patients with ReA (n = 13), undifferentiated SpA (uSpA, n = 10), uOligo (n = 50), juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA, n = 13), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA, n = 10). A nested PCR approach was developed to detect DNA sequences of 8 bacteria: Chlamydia trachomatis, C. pneumoniae, Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella enteritidis, Campylobacter jejuni, Shigella flexneri, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Borrelia burgdorferi. The detection limit was determined at 10 bacterial/sample. Serology and lymphocyte proliferation assay were done in parallel in most patients. RESULTS: In 12 cases bacterial DNA of B. burgdorferi (n = 7), C. trachomatis (n = 2), C. jejuni (n = 2), and C. pneumoniae (n = 1) was detected in patients with uOligo (n = 9) and JCA (n = 3), while no evidence of bacterial DNA was found in patients with ReA, uSpA, and RA. Shigella flexneri DNA was detected in 4 cases, but the significance of this finding remains uncertain due to the high sequence homology of this species with Escherichia coli. DNA of Y. enterocolitica, S. enteritidis, or K. pneumoniae was not found. A positive serologic response was found in 7/9 PCR positive patients. In 11/96 cases antibodies to 2 or more bacteria were found in parallel (11.5%). Antigen specific lymphocyte proliferation was observed in 5/9 PCR positive patients. CONCLUSION: Bacterial DNA was detected in peripheral joint of patients with uOligo and JCA, but not in ReA, uSpA, or RA in this study. The detection of bacterial DNA in synovial material by PCR technology gives useful diagnostic information, especially when antibodies against several microbes are present or antibodies are not detectable. Failure to detect bacterial DNA in patients with ReA and uSpA with longstanding disease suggests that in later stages autoimmune mechanisms may operate.
TI  - Safe poultry meat production in the next century.
AB  - The revolutionary industrialisation of the poultry industry in the last 30 years  has made the food poultry meat available for large groups of consumers. Due to its nutritional, sensory and economical characteristics, poultry meat is by far the most popular animal food product world-wide. Epidemiological reports, however, incriminate poultry meat as a source for outbreaks of human food poisoning. The organisms involved are Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp. and, to a lesser extent, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterocolitica, Clostridium perfringens and Aeromonas spp. Contamination of the end-product with pathogenic microorganisms is a reflection of the contamination of the live birds and, therefore, measures to be taken by industry to avoid contamination of the consumer-ready product should start at that level. In terms of the critical control point approach of the HACCP concept, the quantitative contribution of critical phases in the production chain towards end-product contamination should be estimated in order to take the necessary intervention or corrective steps. To guarantee the production of safe poultry meat, knowledge of the capability of microorganisms to colonise the gastrointestinal tract is needed and the use of vaccines, antimicrobials and competitive exclusion microfloras as well as the implementation of new processing technology should be encouraged.
TI  - Pathogenic micro-organisms in slaughterhouse sludge--a survey.
AB  - During slaughtering of animals and subsequent meat processing the process water used becomes polluted with organic matter of animal origin (i.e. protein and fat). This organic sludge is, in principle, a product suitable for animal feeding. To investigate the microbiological contamination level of sludge, raw sludge was collected at pig (n = 8) and poultry (n = 5) slaughterhouses. Both flocculated and aerobically activated sludge was monitored. Slaughterhouse sludge was heavily contaminated with Enterobacteriaceae (6.3-10.0 in log10 N/gram dry matter) and enterococci (4.6-7.9). Clostridia were present in sludge at a level of 3.1-5.8 (in log10 N/g DM). Salmonella was present in the sludge from all slaughterhouses examined. Yersinia enterocolitica serotypes O:3 and O:9 were found in sludge from seven out of thirteen slaughterhouses. The prevalence of Campylobacter jejuni/coli was higher in flocculated poultry sludge than in both flocculated pig sludge and aerobically activated pig sludge. Obviously, decontamination of the sludge is mandatory when it is to be applied as a feed constituent, to prevent bacterial cycles from occurring in livestock, as well as the spread of human pathogenic zoonoses like campylobacter, salmonella and yersinia, to minimize loss of protein quality by the microbial breakdown of amino acids and the formation of possible toxic metabolites in sludge during storage.
TI  - Attempted definition by immunoblotting of the causes of reactivity in suspected false-positive sera in the Brucella ovis complement fixation test.
AB  - Seventy-nine suspected false-positive sera, obtained over 1 year from routine submissions for Brucella ovis serological testing, were used in this study. These sera, which exhibited titres in the complement fixation test, but which because of their epidemiological history and their reactions in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and gel diffusion test were suspected to be false positives, were further analysed by immunoblotting. In blots, using B. ovis antigens, rough lipopolysaccharide was identified as the major, immuno-reactive bacterial component. Antibodies against this macromolecule were present in 46.8% of the suspected false-positive sera. In order to find out if rough lipopolysaccharides from other bacterial species could be the possible cause for the suspected false positivity, 23 sera with highest complement fixation titres were reacted in blots with cell extracts from Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Bortedella bronchiseptica, Actinobacillus seminis, Campylobacter fetus fetus, Campylobacter jejuni, Mycobacterium paratuberculosis, Mycobacterium phlei, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis and pure lipopolysaccharides from Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. Despite high frequencies of antibody reaction with proteins in most of these bacterial cell extracts, which reflect the presence of infections with these bacteria, immuno-staining in the rough lipopolysaccharide region was not observed.
TI  - Enteropathogens associated with childhood diarrhea in Italy. The Italian Study Group on Gastrointestinal Infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infectious diarrheal diseases remain an important cause of childhood  morbidity in industrialized countries. The knowledge of the etiology and epidemiology of childhood diarrhea in a given area is needed to plan any measure designed to prevent or ameliorate diarrheal illness and to develop practice guidelines for the most appropriate stool examination procedures. METHODS: We evaluated 618 children with diarrhea and 135 controls prospectively for viral, bacterial and parasitic enteric pathogens. Diarrheagenic Escherichia coli was identified by gene probes specific to different virulence factors. Stool filtrates were examined for the presence of free bacterial toxins by a cell culture cytotoxicity assay. Clinical and epidemiologic data were recorded and analyzed in relation to microbiologic findings. RESULTS: Enteropathogens were identified in 59% of children with diarrhea and in 10.4% of asymptomatic controls. The agents mainly associated with disease were rotavirus (23.6%), Salmonella (19.2%) and Campylobacter (7.9%). Rotavirus was significantly more frequent among children observed as inpatients whereas Campylobacter was significantly more common in outpatients. Infections with diarrheagenic E. coli, Shigella flexneri, yersinia enterocolitica, Cryptosporidium and Giardia were observed in a limited number of patients. The clinical presentation of children was not sufficiently characteristic to permit presumptive diagnosis of a specific pathogen. conversely the presence of blood and/or leukocytes in stools had a high positive predictive value for Salmonella or Campylobacter infection. CONCLUSION: The results of this study will be useful for planning strategies to prevent and control diarrheal diseases in our country.
TI  - Foal diarrhoea between 1991 and 1994 in the United Kingdom associated with Clostridium perfringens, rotavirus, Strongyloides westeri and Cryptosporidium spp.
AB  - A case control study of foal diarrhoea in the United Kingdom was carried out over a 3-year period. Clostridium perfringens was significantly associated with foal diarrhoea (Odds Ratio (OR) = 3.0), being isolated from 57% of 421 animals with diarrhoea but from only 27% of 223 healthy foals. Also, C. perfringens was significantly associated with fatal diarrhoea (OR = 4.5). About half of diarrhoea with a fatal outcome was attributable to this organism. The other pathogens significantly associated with diarrhoea were rotavirus (OR = 5.6), Cryptosporidium spp. (OR = 3.2) and the nematode Strongyloides westeri, which was significant only when present in large numbers (> 2000 eggs/g of faeces: OR = 6.1). Salmonella spp. (OR = 14.2) and Cryptosporidium spp. (OR = 3.0) were the only other pathogens associated with fatal illness. Overall, C. perfringens, rotavirus, and large numbers of Cryptosporidium spp. or S. westeri were isolated from 80% of foals with diarrhoea. Thermophilic Campylobacter spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Escherichia coli and other parasites were not associated with diarrhoea. Carriage of C. perfringens, rotavirus and Cryptosporidium spp. was significantly greater in healthy foals in contact with cases of diarrhoea than in foals that were not in contact with diarrhoea (P < 0.05). There were no statistical interactions between any of the pathogens associated with diarrhoea although separate cases from one location often involved more than one pathogen.
TI  - Hazard identification in swine slaughter with respect to foodborne bacteria.
AB  - Swine slaughter is an open process with many opportunities for the contamination  of the pork carcass with potentially pathogenic bacteria; however, it does not contain any point where hazards are completely eliminated. Data on the prevalence of various pathogenic bacteria (Aeromonas hydrophila, Campylobacter coli/jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus and Yersinia enterocolitica) in pigs, their growth and survival characteristics and ability to become established on the slaughter line are presented. The presentation covers the processing steps from lairage to chilling and is based on swine slaughter practices in Denmark, Norway and Sweden. The major contamination points during swine slaughter are pig-related, such as faecal and pharyngeal, and environmental. HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point) and GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) in swine slaughter must be focused on limiting this spread. The pathogenic bacteria show differences in their general mechanism of distribution. The major contamination source of Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp. and Y. enterocolitica is the pig, and the contamination of carcasses with these bacteria may be limited, provided that only strict slaughtering procedures are used. Other organisms such as Aeromonas spp., L. moncytogenes/Listeria spp. and S. aureus can be endemic in the processing environment. Since endemic bacteria can be controlled by proper cleaning and disinfection, these organisms are useful as indicators for the success of GMP rules. The following affiliation to CPs or CCPs made for specific steps during slaughter and dressing may serve as a guidance: (i) lairage (CP), (ii) killing (CP), (iii) scalding (CP), (iv) dehairing (CP), (v) singeing/flaming (CP), (vi) polishing (CP), (vii) circumanal incision and removal of the intestines (CCP), (viii) excision of the tongue, pharynx, and in particular the tonsils (CCP), (ix) splitting (CP), (x) post mortem inspection procedures (CCP) and (xi) deboning of the head (CCP).
TI  - Interruption of microbial cycles in farm animals from farm to table.
AB  - The fact that only slight problems are posed by Salmonella, Campylobacter and Escherichia coli O157 in mammalian farm animals in Norway, is undoubtedly due in large degree to the agricultural set-up with small farms and small herds, allowing a good overview of the situation at any time. Other factors are the very limited import of breeding animals and food products of animal origin, microbiological control of animal feed, and favourable geographical and climatic conditions. However, the Norwegian meat industry (including abattoirs) has continuing problems with Yersinia enterocolitica O:3 in pigs and pig meat, and in some cases with Listeria monocytogenes in cold cuts and Toxoplasma gondii in sheep meat (lamb). These three agents are therefore used to illustrate appropriate measures to be taken at the herd level on the farm, in abattoirs and in the meat processing industry.
TI  - Probes and polymerase chain reaction for detection of food-borne bacterial pathogens.
AB  - DNA-hybridization and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are techniques commonly used to detect pathogenic bacteria. In this paper, the use of these techniques for detection of Salmonella, E. coli, V. cholerae, non-O1 Vibrio, Yersinia enterocolitica, Campylobacter, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, and C. botulinum is reviewed with emphasis on application in food microbiology. In food control, DNA-techniques have most often been used in a 'culture confirmation' fashion, i.e. bacteria are enriched and sometimes even purified by traditional culture procedures and thereafter identified by the use of DNA-based methods. The most desirable approach is, however, to detect organisms directly in the food, but major problems remain to be solved before this can be routinely performed.
TI  - [Isolation of verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli from pediatric patients suffering from enteritis with bloody stool and intussusception].
AB  - We tried to isolate verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) on sorbitol-MacConkey (SMAC) agar and in part by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method from sporadic enteritis patients with bloody stools and intussusception patients who came to three pediatric clinics in the Fukuoka area from October 1990 to September 1994. VTEC O157:H7 strains were isolated from 6 (10.5%) of 57 patients with bloody stools, Campylobacter spp. 15 (26.3%), Salmonella spp. 14 (24.6%) and Yersinia enterocolitica 2. We were not able to detect VT genes by PCR from 11 of 20 patients from whose stools no causative bacteria were isolated. Massive fresh bloody stools following frequent watery diarrhea were typical of the VTEC enteritis patients. Only 1 patient had fever and 2 had leukocytosis, but the C-reactive protein in all of them was below 1+. The VTEC strains were isolated during the summer season, 1 in June, 2 in July, and 3 in September. Since in the area O157:H7 appeared to be the most prevalent VTEC serotype, SMAC is very useful for screening VTEC in bloody stools. VTEC seems to be a rare pathogen of intussusception because the organisms were detected from none of the 30 patients.
TI  - The fate of potentially pathogenic bacteria in Swiss hard and semihard cheeses made from raw milk.
AB  - This study examined the ability of potentially pathogenic bacteria to grow and to survive during the manufacture and ripening of Swiss hard and semihard cheese varieties made from raw milk. The results show that hard cheeses are hygienically safe; 1 wk after fabrication, the inoculated pathogens (Aeromonas hydrophila. Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and Yersinia enterocolitica) could no longer be detected. At the age of commercial ripeness, the semihard cheeses were free from the inoculated pathogens and their toxic metabolites, except for L. monocytogenes, which survived the manufacturing and ripening process.
TI  - The purification of a GroEL-like stress protein from aerobically adapted Campylobacter jejuni.
AB  - From plate cultures of Campylobacter jejuni grown in room air a particulate protein of 62 kDa was isolated by ion-exchange chromatography. The protein had a square shape from the side view but when viewed from the top it had a star-shaped structure. The molecular size of the whole particle determined by gel filtration was 850 kDa which suggested the presence of 14 subunits of 62 kDa in each particle. The N-terminal 37 amino residues showed more than 80% homology with the sequence of these heat shock protein (HSP) 60 homologs of Chlamydia trachomatis, Helicobacter pylori, and Escherichia coli (GroEL). This protein is immunologically cross-reactive with the antiserum for the 60-kDa HSP of Yersinia enterocolitica. Production of the 62-kDa protein increased under heat stress and growth in an aerobic atmospheric environment. From these observations we concluded that the 62-kDa protein is a Campylobacter stress protein (Cj62) which belongs to the HSP 60 family.
TI  - Metabolic activity of pathogenic bacteria during semicontinuous anaerobic digestion.
AB  - In natural environments such as anaerobic digesters, bacteria are frequently subjected to the stress of nutrient fluxes because of the continual changes in the flow of nutrients, and to survive, they must be capable of adapting readily to nutrient changes. In this study, the metabolic activities of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Yersinia enterocolitica, Listeria monocytogenes, and Campylobacter jejuni were studied within culture bags (Versapor-200 filters, 0.22-microns pore size) in laboratory anaerobic digesters. The metabolic activity of these bacteria was indicated by their adenylate energy charge (EC) ratios and their ability to incorporate [3H]thymidine, which was related to the respective changes in viable numbers within the culture bags during anaerobic digestion. Fluctuations in the adenylate EC ratios, the uptake of [3H]thymidine, and the viable numbers of E. coli, S. typhimurium, Y. enterocolitica, and L. monocytogenes cells were probably due to constant changes in the amount of available nutrients within the anaerobic digesters. The viability of S. typhimurium increased quickly after a fresh supply of nutrients was added to the system as indicated by the uptake of [3H]thymidine and an increase in the adenylate EC ratios. The viable numbers of E. coli, S. typhimurium, Y. enterocolitica, and L. monocytogenes organisms declined rapidly from 10(7) to 10(8) CFU/ml to 10(3) to 10(4) CFU/ml and remained at this level for an indefinite period. The decimal reduction time calculated during the period of exponential decline ranged from 0.8 to 1.2 days for these bacteria. C. jejuni had the greatest mean decimal reduction time value (3.6 days).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Two-year study of endemic enteric pathogens associated with acute diarrhea in New Caledonia.
AB  - A longitudinal study of diarrheal disease among patients of all ages with acute diarrhea was carried out in New Caledonia from January 1990 to December 1991. Stool samples from 2,088 diarrheal patients were examined for parasites, rotavirus, and bacterial pathogens. Potential sources of contamination (drinking water, seawater and bovine and porcine feces) were investigated. One or more enteric pathogens were identified in 41.8 and 40.6% of the persons with diarrhea, in 1990 and 1991, respectively. Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., HEp-2 cell adherent Escherichia coli (diffuse adherent and enteroaggregative), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) (EPEC adherence factor-positive strains belonging to classical serotypes), localized adherent E. coli (non-EPEC), and enterotoxigenic E. coli were the frequently identified enteropathogenic bacteria. Other major enteropathogens were Entamoeba histolytica and Giardia lamblia. Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, Yersinia enterocolitica, and rotavirus were isolated from only a few patients. No Vibrio spp., Aeromonas spp., Plesiomonas spp., Shiga-like-toxin-producing E. coli, enterohemorrhagic E. coli, or enteroinvasive E. coli were identified. Shiga-like toxin I-producing E. coli were present in adult bovines and calves, and heat-stable enterotoxin II-producing enterotoxigenic E. coli were found in pigs.
TI  - A PCR-based strategy for the rapid construction of defined bacterial deletion mutants.
AB  
TI  - Effect of ionizing dose rate on the radioresistance of some food pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Food pathogenic bacteria including Listeria monocytogenes (1A1 and ATCC 19111), Staphylococcus aureus (GD13 and ATCC 13565), Escherichia coli O157:H7 (ATCC 35150), Salmonella typhimurium, Yersinia enterocolitica, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and Campylobacter jejuni were exposed to various rates of ionizing radiation (0.78, 2.6, and 22 kGy/h) emitted by three different 60Co irradiators. D10 values (D10 is the radiation dose required to eliminate 90% of a bacterial population (one logarithmic cycle reduction)) were calculated for the various strains and growth conditions tested. A covariance analysis of these results revealed that the dose rates studied had no significant influence on the radiosensitivity of these bacteria. At all dose rates, the bacteria were more radiosensitive when irradiated in a saline solution (0.85% NaCl) than in a chicken breast meat suspension. The growth phase of the bacterial population had a variable influence on its radioresistance. For L. monocytogenes 1A1, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 13565, E. coli O157:H7, Y. enterocolitica, and V. parahaemolyticus, radioresistance was not significantly different in the exponential and stationary phases. Populations of L. monocytogenes ATCC 19111 and Staphylococcus aureus GD13 were significantly more resistant in the stationary phase (D10 = 0.23 and 0.12 kGy, respectively) than in the exponential phase (D10 = 0.17 and 0.09 kGy, respectively). Among the pathogenic bacteria investigated in this study, the most radioresistant was L. monocytogenes (D10 = 0.16-0.38 kGy, Gram-positive bacilli) and the most radiosensitive was V. parahaemolyticus (D10 = 0.03-0.04 kGy, halophilic Gram-negative bacilli).
TI  - Production of DogiK: an improved Ogi (Nigerian fermented weaning food) with potentials for use in diarrhoea control.
AB  - As part of a programme to formulate foods to aid the control of diarrhoeal diseases, an improved ogi (the commonest weaning food in Nigeria) named DogiK has been developed. DogiK was produced by using Lactobacillus starter cultures with antimicrobial activity against diarrhoeagenic bacteria and also possessing amylolytic activity. The survival of diarrhoeagenic bacteria was investigated in locally-fermented ogi and in DogiK. The foods were inoculated with cell suspensions of Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Aeromonas, Pleisiomonas, Enteropathogenic and Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Vibrio cholerae. None of the diarrhoeagenic bacteria were detected in DogiK after 6 h whereas in the local ogi Salmonella, E. coli, and Shigella survived for 24 h or more, but showed a sharp decrease in numbers, while V. cholerae survived for 12 h. DogiK is active whether cooked or uncooked and exhibited inhibition of pathogens at neutral pH. It gives consistent quality. Preliminary investigation indicates possession of a better shelf life. Thus, DogiK may have a potential use in the prevention and treatment of diarrhoea.

TI  - Survival of pathogenic bacteria during mesophilic anaerobic digestion of animal waste.
AB  - The survival of pathogenic bacteria was investigated during the operation of a full-scale anaerobic digester which was fed daily and operated at 28 degrees C. The digester had a mean hydraulic retention time of 24 d. The viable numbers of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Yersinia enterocolitica, Listeria monocytogenes and Campylobacter jejuni were reduced during mesophilic anaerobic digestion. Escherichia coli had the smallest mean viable numbers at each stage of the digestion process. Its mean T90 value was 76.9 d. Yersinia enterocolitica was the least resistant to the anaerobic digester environment; its mean T90 value was 18.2 d. Campylobacter jejuni was the most resistant bacterium; its mean T90 value was 438.6 d. Regression analysis showed that there were no direct relationships between the slurry input and performance of the digester and the decline of pathogen numbers during the 140 d experimental period.
TI  - [Compared antibacterial activity of a new fluoroquinolone, sparfloxacin (AT 4140, RP 64206) and four other fluoroquinolones against 332 strains of enteropathogen bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity of five fluoroquinolones--sparfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin and pefloxacin--was tested against 332 strains of enteric pathogens belonging to the genera Salmonella, Shigella, Escherichia, Yersinia, Vibrio, Campylobacter and Helicobacter. Some of the strains were resistant to one or several antibiotics. Each fluoroquinolone showed identical bacteriostatic activity against susceptible and resistant strains except of those resistant to nalidixic acid. MIC 90% were always below 1 mg/l. The MIC were lowest with ciprofloxacin followed by sparfloxacin and highest with pefloxacin. The five compounds showed different activity against nalidixic acid resistant strains: MIC 90% increased from 0.06 to 4 mg/l for Salmonella, from 0.5 to 4 mg/l for C. jejuni strains, from 0.12 to 16 mg/l for H. pylori strains. All strains remained susceptible to ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, but some were intermediate or resistant to the three other compounds. The minimal bactericidal concentrations of the five agents against the nalidixic acid susceptible or resistant strains were one or two times the corresponding MIC.
TI  - The effect of slurry storage and anaerobic digestion on survival of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The decline in viable numbers of Salmonella typhimurium, Yersinia enterocolitica  and Listeria monocytogene in beef cattle slurry is temperature-dependent; they decline more rapidly at 17 degrees C than at 4 degrees C. Mesophilic anaerobic digestion caused an initial rapid decline in the viable numbers of Escherichia coli, Salm. typhimurium, Y. enterocolitica and L. monocytogenes. This was followed by a period in which the viable numbers were not reduced by 90%. The T90 values of E. coli, Salm. typhimurium and Y. enterocolitica ranged from 0.7 to 0.9 d during batch digestion and 1.1 to 2.5 d during semi-continuous digestion. Listeria monocytogenes had a significantly higher mean T90 value during semi-continuous digestion (35.7 d) than batch digestion (12.3 d). Anaerobic digestion had little effect in reducing the viable numbers of Campylobacter jejuni.
TI  - Antibacterial spectrum of lactoferricin B, a potent bactericidal peptide derived  from the N-terminal region of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  - A physiologically diverse range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin B, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. The list of susceptible organisms includes Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens. Concentrations of lactoferricin B required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 micrograms/ml, depending on the strain and the culture medium used. The peptide showed activity against E. coli O111 over the range of pH 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. Its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of Na+, K+, Mg2+ or Ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. Lactoferricin B was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability in most of the species tested. Pseudomonas fluorescens, Enterococcus faecalis and Bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.
TI  - Degenerate PCR primers for the amplification of fragments from genes encoding response regulators from a range of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Many bacterial responses to environmental stimuli are mediated by response regulators which coordinately regulate genes involved in particular adaptive responses. Degenerate oligonucleotide primers were used to amplify by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), fragments from genes encoding eleven novel response regulators. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis revealed that phoB, phoP and creB gene fragments had been amplified from Yersinia enterocolitica and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and that a creB sequence had been amplified from Campylobacter jejuni. Four amplified fragments from C. jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Escherichia coli clearly came from response regulator genes, but were not closely related to any of the known genes. Mutagenesis of the newly identified genes should allow us to determine their function and the genes under their control.
TI  - In vitro activity of lomefloxacin and other antimicrobials against bacterial enteritis pathogens.
AB  - Lomefloxacin is a new, difluoroquinolone. In this study, the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin against clinical isolates of a variety of bacterial species associated with acute diarrheal disease was determined and compared with that of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, amoxicillin, sulphamethoxazole, trimethoprim, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol. Bacterial isolates were obtained from different geographical areas, including Western Europe and the United Kingdom, Southern Europe, Africa, the Middle East, South and Southeast Asia, and South America, and were included to reflect the range of susceptibility seen throughout the world. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using an agar incorporation technique in Mueller-Hinton medium supplemented when necessary with saponin-lysed horse blood at a final concentration of 10% vol/vol. Lomefloxacin was highly active against all the species examined which included Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Escherichia coli enterotoxigenic [(ETEC), enteroinvasive (EIEC), and enteropathogenic (EPEC) strains], Yersinia enterocolitica, Campylobacter jejuni, Vibrio spp., and Aeromonas hydrophila, with all isolates inhibited by 1 mg/L or less. This activity was similar to ofloxacin and slightly less than that of ciprofloxacin. By contrast, many of the isolates were resistant to one or more of the other, unrelated animicrobials. No cross-resistance between lomefloxacin and any of the nonfluoroquinolone antimicrobials examined in the study was observed.
TI  - Cross-reactive proteins of Borrelia burgdorferi.
AB  - The specificity of serological tests for Lyme borreliosis is impaired by cross-reacting antibodies. In order to select antigens for more specific tests, specific and cross-reactive proteins of Borrelia burgdorferi must be identified. Therefore, to analyze cross reactions of Borrelia burgdorferi with other bacteria, rabbit immune sera against heterologous bacteria (Borrelia hermsii, Treponema pallidum, Treponema phagedenis, Leptospira interrogans (serogroup grippotyphosa), Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Yersinia enterocolitica (serotypes O3 and O9), Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes O1, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri and Legionella micdadei) were examined by Western blot using Borrelia burgdorferi as antigen. Broad cross reactivity was shown for Borrelia proteins of the 60-75 kDa range. Other broadly cross-reacting proteins were at the level of p40, p33 and two proteins in the range of 20 kDa. Some of the cross reactions were eliminated by absorption of the sera with Treponema phagedenis. The absorbed antibodies were directed mainly against bands at the level of p33 and bands of the 60 to 75 kDa range. Showing the lowest potential for cross reactivity, p100, p41, OspA and pC seem to be the most suitable antigens for serodiagnosis. In contrast to p100 and OspA, however, p41 and pC showed cross reactivity with immune sera against bacteria not belonging to the genus Borrelia.
TI  - Campylobacter enteritis in Portugal: epidemiological features and biological markers.
AB  - From 1984 to 1989, stool samples from 2811 gastroenteritis cases were examined for the presence of Campylobacter jejuni and C. Coli, Salmonella, Shigella and Yersinia species. Isolation rates were: Campylobacter jejuni and C. Coli, 5.3%, Salmonella spp., 14.8%, Shigella spp., 4.6% and Yersinia enterocolitica, 1.1%. Age group distribution analysis shows a higher Campylobacter isolation rate in children under one year of age. Seasonal distribution revealed a peak incidence in winter as in other Mediterranean countries. Predominant biotypes were C. jejuni I (51%), C. jejuni II (21.5%) and C. coli I (18.8%). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing did not reveal resistance to erythromycin. Thirty of the strains harboured plasmids with 7 different profiles.
TI  - A study of the bacterial and parasitic causes of acute diarrhoea in northern Jordan.
AB  - The prevalence of bacterial and parasitic diarrhoeagenic agents in 200 patients suffering from acute diarrhoea and reporting to hospitals and health centres in northern Jordan, and in controls was determined. One or more bacterial or parasitic enteropathogens was isolated from 79 patients (39.5%). Prevalence rates for these pathogens was as follows: Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, 9%; enteropathogenic E. coli, 9%; Salmonella spp. 7%; Campylobacter spp, 5.5%; Yersinia enterocolitica, 4.5%; Shigella spp, 4%; Aeromonas spp, 3.5%; enterotoxigenic Clostridium perfringens, 2%; Vibrio spp, 2%; and Plesiomonas shigelloides, 0.5%. Both Giardia lamblia and Entamoeba histolytica were detected in 2% of the stool samples examined. Although the determination of the aetiologic role of the identified enteropathogens was complicated by more than one factor, the data collected will serve as a baseline for future studies of the subject.
TI  - The prevalence of enteric pathogens in diarrhoeic thoroughbred foals in Britain and Ireland.
AB  - A survey of 77 normal and 326 diarrhoeic foals in Britain and Ireland from 1987 to 1989 revealed a significantly higher prevalence of Group A rotaviruses and Aeromonas hydrophila in diarrhoeic foals. The prevalence of cryptosporidia, potentially pathogenic Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica and Clostridium perfringens was similar in normal or diarrhoeic foals. Rotaviruses had a similar prevalence in all age groups of scouring foals up to three months of age, with an overall prevalence of 37 per cent among diarrhoeic foals. The number of cases of diarrhoea varied considerably from year to year, but in all three years of the survey rotavirus was a significant pathogen. A comparison of diagnostic tests for rotavirus in the faeces showed electron microscopy (EM) and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) to have similar sensitivity. The Rotazyme ELISA test kit was found to have the same sensitivity as a combination of EM and PAGE. A. hydrophila had an overall prevalence of 9 per cent among diarrhoeic foals, although its prevalence was higher in some age groups. A. hydrophila has not been established previously as a significant enteric pathogen in foals. Other putative pathogens found at very low prevalence were coronavirus, the putative picobirnavirus, Campylobacter spp. and Salmonella spp. No evidence was found of synergistic effects between rotavirus, cryptosporidia and potentially pathogenic E. coli. Neither coccidia nor non-Group A rotaviruses were found in any of the samples examined.
TI  - [An immunoenzyme test system for the detection of antibodies to Campylobacter].
AB  - An enzyme immunoassay system for the detection of antibodies to bacteria of the genus Campylobacter in human blood serum has been developed. The system is based on the use of ethanol-treated C. jejuni and C. coli whole cells as antigen. The study of sera obtained from healthy donors in this assay has made it possible to establish the value of the tentative diagnostic titer: 320.
TI  - Survival and injury of Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, and Yersinia enterocolitica in stream water.
AB  - Experiments were done to describe the survival and injury of three strains each of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Campylobacter jejuni in agricultural surface water. Bacterial suspensions within membrane diffusion chambers were immersed in two large vessels of stream water that were held at 6 and 16 degrees C and changed daily. The results of daily plate counts, using selective and nonselective media, revealed some variation among strains and genera. Injury increased rapidly in all of the bacteria examined during an initial 4-day period of population stability. Bacterial persistence was generally prolonged at 6 degrees C, while the occurrence of injury was directly related to temperature. However, both survival and injury in C. jejuni were less dependent on temperature, while Y. enterocolitica displayed the greatest survival at both 6 and 16 degrees C. These results suggest that surface water in the temperate zone might serve as a persistent vehicle for the transmission of these enteropathogenic bacteria between animals and humans.
TI  - Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli associated with infant diarrhoea in Galicia, north-western Spain.
AB  - To assess the role of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) in infantile diarrhoea, 482 children with diarrhoea and 103 healthy controls, from three localities of Galicia, north-western Spain, were investigated between 1985 and 1988. Rotavirus (37.3%) and Salmonella spp. (12.8%) were the most common causal agents, followed by ETEC (3.9%), Campylobacter jejuni (2.3%), Shigella spp. (0.9%) and Yersinia enterocolitica (0.5%). ETEC were significantly more frequently isolated from children with diarrhoea who were under 1 month of age (26.5%) than from older diarrhoeic children (2.2%) (p less than 0.001) or from healthy children who were under 1 month of age (0%) (p less than 0.05). Among children who harboured ETEC, five of the nine children under 1 month of age developed diarrhoea in hospital, whereas none of the 10 children over 1 month of age did so. Seventeen ETEC isolates produced heat-stable enterotoxin (STa) only, four produced only heat-labile enterotoxin (LT), and two produced both toxins. Colonisation factor antigens CFA/I and CFA/II were detected in 11 (55.0%) of the 20 ETEC isolates that remained enterotoxigenic after maintenance in the laboratory. Most ETEC isolates belonged to serotypes O153:K-:H45 (nine STa+ CFA/I+ isolates), O27:K-:H7 (three STa+ isolates) or O6:K15:H16 (two LT+ STa+ CFA/II+ isolates). Our results suggest that ETEC constitute an important cause of neonatal diarrhoea in this part of Spain.
TI  - Therapy for acute infectious diarrhea in children.
AB  - This article reviews current recommendations of therapy with antidiarrheal compounds and antimicrobial agents for acute infectious diarrhea in children. In most infants and children with acute infectious diarrhea, treatment with antidiarrheal compounds is not indicated. Many of these compounds interfere with identification of enteropathogens in stool specimens, and the antimotility class has an overdose potential. Antimicrobial therapy is given to reduce symptoms and to prevent the spread of infection by decreasing fecal shedding of organisms. Although effective therapy is not available for patients with enteric viruses, Cryptosporidium, and Microsporidium, therapy is useful for children with amebiasis, antimicrobial-associated colitis, cholera, giardiasis, various forms of Escherichia coli diarrhea and Salmonella disease, isosporiasis, shigellosis, and strongyloidiasis. For several other conditions, antimicrobial therapy is of questionable benefit (infection with Campylobacter jejuni or Yersinia enterocolitica, intestinal salmonellosis and enterohemorrhagic E. coli infection). Compounds such as the fluoroquinolones, which are effective in the treatment of acute infectious diarrhea in adults, are not approved for use in children because of potential side effects. Many bacterial, viral, and parasitic organisms cause acute infectious diarrhea; appropriate antimicrobial therapy requires the accurate, rapid identification of the offending enteropathogen. In children with an underlying illness such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, manifestations may be prolonged, severe, and recurrent despite appropriate therapy.
TI  - Effects of high hydrostatic pressure on characteristics of pork slurries and inactivation of microorganisms associated with meat and meat products.
AB  - Pork slurries inoculated with various test microorganisms were prepared and subjected to high hydrostatic pressure at 1000 to 6000 atm for 10 min at 25 degrees C to examine for the pressure effects on characteristics of the slurries and the inactivation of the microorganisms associated with meat and meat products. Pressure treatment at higher than 3000 atm caused coagulation and discoloration of the pork slurries. Harder and more white coagulants were obtained by increasing the pressure. Pressure treatment at 3000 to 6000 atm killed all the microorganisms tested by more than 6-log colony-forming units (cfu)/g except Bacillus cereus spores. Gram-negative microorganisms were more labile to pressure than Gram-positive ones. Campylobacter jejuni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium and Yersinia enterocolitica were inactivated at pressures higher than 3000 atm; Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida utilis at pressures higher than 4000 atm; Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis at 6000 atm. Only less than one-log cfu/g of B. cereus spores were inactivated at 6000 atm. Ultraviolet absorption spectra and acridine orange staining suggested that E. coli became permeable and leaked cytoplasmic RNA at lower pressure than S. aureus. From the present findings, the authors propose high hydrostatic pressure treatment as a promising means of preparing wholesome meat and meat products.
TI  - Travelers' diarrhea among United States military personnel during joint American-Egyptian armed forces exercises in Cairo, Egypt.
AB  - A study was conducted of travelers' diarrhea in a United States military population on deployment in Cairo, Egypt, during July and August 1987. Acute diarrhea requiring medical attention developed in 183 (4%) of 4,500 troops. A possible etiologic agent was identified in 49% of all diarrhea cases. Enteric pathogens associated with cases of diarrhea included: Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (17% ST-producers, 13% LT-producers, and 3% LT/ST-producers); Shigella (9%); Campylobacter spp. (2%); Salmonella (2%); and Vibrio cholerae non-01 serogroup (2%). Other enteric pathogens isolated from one episode each of diarrhea included Aeromonas hydrophila group, Plesiomonas shigelloides, and Bacillus cereus. Yersinia enterocolitica, enteroinvasive E. coli, intoxications by Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile, and pathogenic enteric parasites were not found in any of the 183 patients with diarrhea. A survey of military personnel not requesting medical care indicated that up to 40% of troops may have had diarrhea during this deployment. Acute gastroenteritis is a potential cause of substantial morbidity in U.S. military personnel deployed to Egypt.
TI  - Production and characterization of a monoclonal antibody specific for enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli of serotypes O157:H7 and O26:H11.
AB  - A monoclonal antibody (MAb 4E8C12) specific for Escherichia coli O157:H7 and O26:H11 was produced by immunizing BALB/c mice with a rough strain of E. coli O157:H7. The antibody reacted strongly by a direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with each of 36 strains of E. coli O157:H7. No cross-reactivity was observed with strains of Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Shigella dysenteriae, Proteus spp., Escherichia hermanii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Campylobacter jejuni, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Hafnia alvei, Aeromonas hydrophila, and all except five strains of E. coli other than serotype O157:H7 (including strains of serotype O157 but not H7). The E. coli strains (all of serotype O26:H11) that reacted with the antibody were enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) that were isolated from patients with hemolytic uremic syndrome or hemorrhagic colitis and produced verotoxin similar to that of E. coli O157:H7. MAb 4E8C12 belongs to the subclass immunoglobulin G2a and has a kappa light chain. Tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of outer membrane proteins of E. coli of different serotypes followed by Western immunoblot analysis revealed that MAb 4E8C12 reacted specifically with two proteins of EHEC strains of serotypes O157:H7 and O26:H11 with apparent molecular weights of 5,000 to 6,000. These proteins appeared to be markers specific for EHEC strains of serotypes O157:H7 and O26:H11. This MAb, because of its specificity, may be a useful reagent of an immunoassay for the rapid detection of these types of EHEC isolates in clinical and food specimens.
TI  - Acidity and intestinal bacteria: an in-vitro assessment of the bactericidal activity of hydrochloric acid on intestinal pathogens.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of hydrochloric acid (HCl) on different intestinal bacteria was evaluated at various pH values and time intervals. The effect of HCl was highest at pH 2 and pH 3 on strains of Campylobacter jejuni, Aeromonas hydrophila, Plesiomonas shigelloides, Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp., producing complete killing after 60 min incubation. However, at higher pH values (pH 4 and above), these organisms not only survived but they also showed evidence of rapid multiplication. In contrast, clinical and standard strains of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were resistant to all the pH values. Highest sensitivity to HCl was observed with strains of Shigella spp. and Salmonella spp. It is conceivable that patients with normal gastric acidity should not suffer from gastroenteritis caused by these intestinal pathogens.
TI  - [A 3-year follow-up study of the incidence of campylobacteriosis in a pediatric population].
AB  - The authors investigated the incidence of campylobacteriosis in the population of five paediatric health communities of the Jihlava policlinic (5831 children) for a period of three years. A total of 2408 specimens faeces from 1501 subjects were examined. Campylobacter jejuni was detected in 151 subjects (10.1%), Salmonella sp. in 47 (3.1%), Shigella sp. in 18 (1.2%), Yersinia enterocolitica in 12 (0.8%) and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli in five subjects (0.3%). The total incidence of campylobacteriosis in the investigated group was 863 cases per 100,000 subjects per year. The incidence of campylobacteriosis was seasonal with a maximum during the summer months. To elucidate the source of infection and way of transmission 323 smears from animals, animal products and from the environment were made. Seventy were positive. Campylobacterosis is transmitted to man most frequently by ingestion of primarily or secondarily contamined food, by contact with animals and even interhuman transmission cannot be ruled out. The most frequent clinical symptoms of campylobacteriosis were diarrhoea, fever, abdominal pain and vomiting. Seventeen children were hospitalized. For treatment most frequently Endiaron was used and dietotherapy. Campylobacteriosis affects significantly more frequently children of gipsy origin.
TI  - [Value of microbiologic studies for diagnosis of post-enteritis reactive arthritis].
AB  - Reactive arthritis may develop within a period of some days until upto 3 weeks after infections with Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Campylobacter jejuni/coli, Shigella and Salmonella. Intestinal infections with Klebsiella pneumoniae, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, Cryptosporidium, Strongyloides stercoralis, Taenia saginata and Schistosoma mansoni are, in some cases, considered to be responsible for reactive arthritis. Detection of pathogenic bacteria in feces is generally most successful in the early stage of the infection. A large spectrum of special tests is required in order to detect all the causative agents and to ensure reliable results. It is therefore necessary that the laboratory is provided with information about the diagnostic object and the tentative diagnosis. The detection of serum antibodies to Y. enterocolitica, Y. pseudotuberculosis, C. jejuni/coli, and Schistosoma may suggest connections between infection and reactive arthritis.
TI  - [Sensitivity of enteropathogenic bacteria to furazolidone].
AB  - The sensitivity in vitro of 348 strains of 18 enteropathogen agents to furazolidone was investigated during the period of 1987-1989. All strains of Shigella sonnei (17), S. flexneri (17), S. boydii (16), Escherichia coli enteropathogen (40), E. coli enteroinvasive (20), Campylobacter jejuni (50), Vibrio cholerae 01 (5), Vibrio cholerae non 01 (5), V. parahaemolyticus (5), V. alginolyticus (2), Aeromonas hydrophila (5), A. caviae (5), A. sobria (5), and Plesiomonas shigelloides (12) were sensitive (MIC < or = 8 mg/l), except a strains of E. coli enteropathogen (MIC 16 mg/l). The 15.5% of the 51 strains of Salmonella enterica belonging to the type I isolated between 1987 and 1989 were resistant (MIC > or = 16 mg/l). A similar degree of resistance was observed in 20 strains of this agent isolated between 1978 and 1980. The 30 strains of Yersinia (including 15 strains of Y. enterocolitica 03) presented extreme values of MICs of 8 and 16 mg/l.
TI  - ACP Broadsheet 124: May 1990. Examination of faeces for bacterial pathogens.
AB  
TI  - In vitro activity of norfloxacin and other antibacterial agents against gastro-intestinal pathogens isolated in Sweden.
AB  - The in vitro activity of norfloxacin was compared to that of ampicillin, doxycycline, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim in combination with sulfamethoxazole (1/20), and erythromycin, against 272 clinical isolates of gastro-intestinal pathogens. Norfloxacin was the most active compound of those tested with MICs in the range 0.004-2 mg/l. Concentrations inhibiting 90% of the strains (MIC 90) were 0.008 mg/l for Vibrio cholerae, 0.016 mg/l for Aeromonas hydrophila, 0.032 mg/l for Vibrio cholerae non 01, 0.064 mg/l for Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Yersinia enterocolitica 03, enterotoxigenic (ETEC) and enteropathogenic (EPEC) Escherichia coli and Shigella species, 0.125 mg/l for Salmonella species, and 0.5 mg/l for Campylobacter species. Resistance to one or several of the other drugs was seen with higher or lower frequency in all the bacterial species tested. No cross-resistance between any of the other agents and norfloxacin was recorded.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of bismuth subsalicylate and other bismuth salts.
AB  - This report demonstrates that bismuth subsalicylate (BSS) effectively inhibits growth of a number of bacterial strains known to cause diarrhea, including Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter. Other bismuth salts and sodium salicylate, a hydrolysis product of BSS in the gut, also were examined and were shown to have various degrees of activity. Growth of the organisms was monitored in vitro by inoculating culture fluid that contained one of the compounds to be tested and determining the concentration of viable organisms over a 24-hour period. Control cultures of each organism were grown in the absence of bismuth subsalicylate. BSS inhibited growth of all organisms examined in a dose-dependent fashion. Reductions of 2-6 logs, as compared with controls, were observed in cultures grown in the presence of 10-50 mM BSS. Other bismuth salts displayed various degrees of inhibition. These results suggest that the efficacy of BSS as an antidiarrheal agent may be related to an antimicrobial mechanism of action.
TI  - Production of specific monoclonal antibodies to Salmonella typhi flagellin and possible application to immunodiagnosis of typhoid fever.
AB  - Four murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to Salmonella typhi flagellin were produced. These MAbs did not react with eight other enterobacterial strains tested: Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella paratyphi A, Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, Shigella sonnei, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Campylobacter jejuni. All four MAbs cross-reacted with Salmonella muenchen flagellin indicating specificity for d antigenic flagellar epitope. One MAb (C4) was selected to develop a double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect S. typhi flagellin in serum samples. By use of this assay S. typhi flagellar antigen was detected in 95.5% of serum samples from patients with positive hemoculture for S. typhi, in 93.6% of samples from patients with positive serodiagnosis of typhoid fever, in 26% of samples collected from patients who were initially hemoculture-positive for S. typhi and who had undergone 7-8 d of chemotherapy, in 8.5% of samples from healthy persons from an endemic area, and in no samples from healthy persons from a nonendemic area. The presence of high levels of flagellin antibody titers did not interfere with the antigen detection. The detection of S. typhi flagellar antigen in patient serum may have practical value for rapid diagnosis of typhoid fever.
TI  - Heat resistance of Campylobacter and Yersinia strains by three methods.
AB  - Two methods of determining the heat resistance of bacteria, a glass cup and a test tube method, were compared with a method using capillary tubes. Three strains of Yersinia enterocolitica, one of Campylobacter jejuni and two of C. coli were tested in physiological saline. The differences between the results obtained by the glass cup method and the reference method were not statistically significant for five strains and were small also for the other, a Yersinia strain. D values obtained by the glass cup method at 58, 60 and 62 degrees C were 1.4-1.8, 0.40-0.51 and 0.15-0.19 min (zeta values 4.00-4.52 degrees C) for the Yersinia strains, and 0.42, 0.13 and 0.07 min (zeta value 5.07 degrees C) for one C. coli strain. For the other Campylobacter strains, D values of 0.71-0.78, 0.24-0.28 and 0.12-0.14 min (zeta values 4.94 and 5.60 degrees C) were recorded at 56, 58 and 60 degrees C. D values obtained at 60 degrees C by the test tube method were 2.7-5.0 min and were considered to be unrealistic.
TI  - Epidemiology and aetiology of acute childhood diarrhoea in Burma: a rural community survey.
AB  - Identical epidemiological and microbiological surveys were carried out in a rural community at Intakaw, Burma, in 2 months, one in the hot wet and the other in the cool dry season. The incidence of diarrhoea was highest in children under 3 years old and in the hot wet month when enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli was the predominant pathogen. Rotavirus was the commonest pathogen in the cool dry month but was absent in the hot wet month. Shigellae, salmonellae and campylobacter were isolated in both seasons, but were not significantly commoner in patients than in controls. Vibrios and Yersinia enterocolitica were sought but not found in any specimen.
TI  - [Bacterial isolation in infants hospitalized for acute diarrhea].
AB  - Bacteria were investigated in stools of 156 children under two years of age admitted to the pediatric wards of a general hospital at the western metropolitan area of Santiago, Chile, because of acute diarrhea with only one stool sample. A known pathogenic agent was isolated from 115 cases (73.7%), this being a bacteria in 87/115 (75.6%). Most prevalent microorganisms were Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC). (65.5%), specially serogroups 0111, 0119 and 055, Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) (18.4%), Campylobacter yeyuni (13.8%), Salmonellae (9.2%) and Shigellae (6.9%). Invasive Escherichia coli (EIEC) and Aeromonas hydrophila were observed in only one case. Yersinia enterocolitica was not isolated. Age was under one year in 92% of patients and 83% were normally or slightly under nourished. Fecal leucocytes were abnormally increased (greater than 5 per high power field) in 41.4% of positive bacterial isolates, in 83% of children with Shigellae, in 50% of those with EPEC and Salmonellae and in 25% of the Campylobacter yeyuni group.
TI  - In-vitro activity of meropenem against clinical isolates obtained in Canada.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was compared with that of imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, gentamicin and, where appropriate, other antibiotics against recent clinical isolates and characterized beta-lactamase producers. MICs were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. Meropenem inhibited 90% of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens and Providencia stuartii at less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l and was four- to 16-fold more active than imipenem against these species. Against the enteric pathogens Salmonella typhi, Shigella sonnei, Yersinia enterocolitica and Campylobacter jejuni, meropenem was four- to eight-fold more active than imipenem, inhibiting all isolates at less than or equal to 0.03 mg/l. Meropenem was also more active than imipenem against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90 0.06 mg/l) but had similar activity against the Bacteroides fragilis group (MIC90 0.25 mg/l), against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 2 mg/l) and against streptococci. Imipenem was four-fold more active than meropenem against Acinetobacter spp. and two- to eight-fold more active against all species of staphylococci tested. Both meropenem and imipenem were inactive against Ps. (Xanthomonas) maltophilia.
TI  - Bacterial and viral causes of acute diarrhoea in children in Kuwait.
AB  - Bacterial and viral causes of acute diarrhoea were studied prospectively for one  year in 343 hospitalised young children in Kuwait. In 288 (84%) patients, one or more pathogens were identified compared with 12 of 86 (13.9%) children admitted with diseases other than diarrhoea (p less than 0.01). Forty-four (12.9%) of the patients were infected with two or more pathogens. Viral agents detected in the stools were rotaviruses (40.2%), enteric adenoviruses (1.7%), and enteroviruses (1.5%). Enterobacteria were isolated from the stools of 44% of the patients as follows: Salmonella (18.0%), enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) (17.5%), enterotoxigenic E. coli (6.7%), Shigella (5.0%), Campylobacter jejuni (2.3%), Vibrio cholerae non-01 (2.3%), Yersinia enterocolitica (1.5%), and Aeromonas hydrophila (0.9%). The incidence of diarrhoea in children showed two seasonal peaks: during March-May and October-November. The present study indicates that Salmonella and EPEC are the major causes of bacterial gastroenteritis, while rotaviruses are the main cause of viral gastroenteritis in young children in Kuwait.
TI  - [Antibacterial and bactericidal activities of Japanese green tea].
AB  - We found that extracts of Japanese green tea leaves inhibited the growth of various bacteria causing diarrheal diseases. All tea samples tested showed antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Vibrio cholerae O1, V. cholerae non O1. V. parahaemolyticus, V. mimicus, Campylobacter jejuni and Plesiomonas shigelloides. None of the tea samples had any effect on the growth of V. fluvialis, Aeromonas sobria, A. hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis, enteroinvasive Escherichia coli, enterohemorrhagic E. coli, enteropathogenic E. coli, enterotoxigenic E. coli, Enterobacter cloacae or Yersinia enterocolitica. Salmonella and Shigella showed susceptibilities different depending on the kind of Japanese green tea. Japanese green tea showed also bactericidal activity over S. aureus, V. parahaemolyticus and even enteropathogenic E. coli which was not sensitive when tested by cup method. The bactericidal activity was shown even at the drinking concentration in daily life.
TI  - "New" food-borne pathogens of public health significance.
AB  - Recent work by epidemiologists and microbiologists has uncovered several hitherto unrecognized food-borne bacterial pathogens of public health significance. One of these, Listeria monocytogenes, has attracted considerable attention because of two major cheese-related outbreaks of listeriosis that were characterized by cases of meningitis, abortion, and perinatal septicemia. Thus far, L. monocytogenes has been responsible for well over 300 reported cases of food-borne listeriosis, including about 100 deaths, and has cost the dairy industry alone more than 66 million dollars as a result of product recalls. The ability of L. monocytogenes to grow at refrigeration temperatures, coupled with appearance of the pathogen in raw and processed meats, as well as poultry, vegetables, and seafood, makes this bacterium a serious threat to susceptible consumers and to the entire food industry. Yersinia enterocolitica, another psychrotrophic food-borne pathogen of recent concern, was linked to several outbreaks of yersiniosis associated with consumption of both raw and pasteurized milk, as well as contaminated water. Food-borne infections involving Y. enterocolitica typically result in enterocolitis, which may be mistaken for acute appendicitis. Unfortunately, inadvertent removal of healthy appendixes from victims of food-borne yersiniosis is all too common. Although known for many years, Campylobacter jejuni has only recently been recognized as a food-borne pathogen and a leading cause of gastroenteritis in the United States. Notable outbreaks of campylobacteriosis linked to consumption of raw milk, cake icing, eggs, poultry, and beef have underscored the need for thorough cooking and proper handling of raw products.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [The occurrence of Escherichia coli, Aeromonas hydrophila, Plesiomonas shigelloides and Clostridium perfringens in the intestinal flora of gray herons (Ardea cinerea)].
AB  - The flora of the large intestine of 92 grey herons was examined for the frequency of aerobic and microaerobic growing bacteria. Clostridium perfringens, Aeromonas hydrophila, Plesiomonas shigelloides and E. coli were isolated from 55%, 48%, 14% and 35% of the birds, respectively. It could be demonstrated that the findings of these bacteria in the intestinal flora are depending on the age of the birds. The percentage of carriers of Clostridium perfringens, Aeromonas hydrophila and Plesiomonas shigelloides was highest in nestlings younger than 18 days, less high in older nestlings and lowest in adult grey herons. Contrary to those bacteria, E. coli was found more often in the intestinal flora at increasing age of the birds. Salmonella spp. were isolated from 6 birds. Two birds yielded positive for Yersinia enterocolitica and Campylobacter spp., respectively. Other aerobic and microaerobic bacteria play a less significant role as part of the intestinal flora.
TI  - [Stationary and migratory avifauna as reservoirs of Salmonella, Yersinia and Campylobacter].
AB  - Domestic and wild animals have been always considered very important as reservoir of agents of human infections. Particularly birds, because of their great mobility from a continent to another or within the limits of the same ecosystem may transfer pathogenic micro-organisms. The present survey was undertaken in order to evaluate the presence of Campylobacter, Yersinia and Salmonella in migratory and permanent birds. During the period October 1986 to March 1988 intestinal loops were collected from a total of 217 birds representing 17 different species shot, during hunting seasons, in the inland of Versilia in the district of Lucca. Each sample was divided into three parts and examined for the presence of Campylobacter, Yersinia and Salmonella. Campylobacter was isolated from 74 of the 217 birds examined (34.10%). Yersinia was recovered from 26 birds (11.98%), while only 8 birds (3.68%) harboured Salmonella. Most of the samples carried only one of the three bacterial genera investigated while 9 harboured at the same time Yersinia and Campylobacter, 1 Salmonella and Campylobacter, and 1 Salmonella, Yersinia and Campylobacter. Campylobacter spp.: On the ground of Lior's biotyping scheme, the 74 strains, isolated from 16 of the 17 species of birds examined, have assigned to three biochemically different species. C. coli was the most commonly isolated followed by C. jejuni and C. laridis. Of the 54 isolates of C. coli 30 belonged to biotype I and 24 to biotype II. 19 C. jejuni organisms were differentiated into 5 belonging to biotype I and 14 to biotype II. The only C. laridis isolated belonged to biotype I. Yersinia spp.: 37 strains belonging to the genus Yersinia were isolated from 26 birds. In 10 samples different types of Yersinia were identified. Most of the strains could be ascribed to Yersinia enterocolitica (28 strains), 3 to Yersinia frederiksenii, 3 to Yersinia intermedia and 1 to Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. 2 strains were identified as atypical Yersinia. Salmonella spp.: 8 strains belonging to the genus Salmonella were isolated from 3 different species of birds. The isolates were identified as Salmonella typhi-murium (7 strains) and Salmonella blockley (1 strain). Salmonella has been isolated from 8 birds, six of which were pheasants shot during the same day in the same area and probably coming from the same breeding. In fact, in Tuscany, pheasants are bred and then set free in many hunting areas.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Prospective study of the etiology of diarrhea in adult outpatients and inpatients.
AB  - A prospective study of the etiology of diarrhea in 253 adult outpatients and inpatients was conducted in Helsinki in 1985-86. The outpatients constituted 84.6% of all patients studied. A broad panel of diagnostic techniques was applied, including detection of bacteria and parasites in the feces and determination of the serologic responses to campylobacter, salmonella, Yersinia enterocolitica, and several viruses. Pathogens were identified for 28.5% of the patients. The commonest findings were Campylobacter jejuni/coli in 13.0% and Salmonella species in 7.1% of the patients. Mixed infections of several pathogens were found in 16 patients.
TI  - [Bacterial etiological factors of diarrhea in the stool of infants hospitalized in January 1987].
AB  - The results are presented of the second part of the studies conducted for monitoring of the variability of bacterial factors causing diarrhoea in the youngest children. The presently reported study comprised 42 babies aged from 7 days to 18 months treated in hospital in January 1987. The number of children with diarrhoea hospitalized in this period was relatively smaller than in January 1985, while the incidence of enteropathogenic bacteria in stools was very similar. They included mainly Klebsiella and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli strains, especially in the youngest children. In only one case Salmonella arizonae was found while in 1985 a very high number of Salmonella agona strains were cultured, especially from newborns. In both parts of the study Campylobacter jejuni and Yersinia enterocolitica were never found in stools. In both parts of the study the course of bacterial diarrhoea was mostly moderately severe, loose stools continued usually for 3-4 days, but in the second part more cases of severe diarrhoea were noted, which, however, could not have been related to the bacterial species cultured from stools or to the presence of mixed bacterial flora. The importance is stressed of the carrier state of enteropathogenic bacteria which was observed in three-fourths of patients in January 1987, while in January 1985 this was present in nearly all cases without diarrhoea.
TI  - [Which are the most frequently occurring enteropathogenic bacteria in clinical practice?].
AB  - Diarrhea is an increasingly frequent clinical finding in Swiss medical practice.  One reason is the volume of tourism in countries with different climatic and social circumstances. To obtain an overview of the enteropathogenic bacteria spectrum as a cause of diarrhea, we analyzed 11,163 stool specimens from a representative group of patients throughout Switzerland. Enteropathogenic bacteria were found in 15.2% of all specimens; 50% were Campylobacter jejuni/coli, 35% Salmonella spp., 8% Aeromonas hydrophila group, 4% Shigella spp. and 3% Yersinia enterocolitica. This distribution is taken for all age groups and for both sexes. In the infant age there was a maximum evidence of enteropathogenic bacteria of the female sex. In childhood this maximum concerned to the male sex. Patients older than fifty had no positive stool specimens. As expected the most frequent positive stool specimens were in summer.
TI  - Survival of coliforms and bacterial pathogens within protozoa during chlorination.
AB  - The susceptibility of coliform bacteria and bacterial pathogens to free chlorine  residuals was determined before and after incubation with amoebae and ciliate protozoa. Viability of bacteria was quantified to determine their resistance to free chlorine residuals when ingested by laboratory strains of Acanthamoeba castellanii and Tetrahymena pyriformis. Cocultures of bacteria and protozoa were incubated to facilitate ingestion of the bacteria and then were chlorinated, neutralized, and sonicated to release intracellular bacteria. Qualitative susceptibility of protozoan strains to free chlorine was also assessed. Protozoa were shown to survive and grow after exposure to levels of free chlorine residuals that killed free-living bacteria. Ingested coliforms Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Klebsiella oxytoca and bacterial pathogens Salmonella typhimurium, Yersinia enterocolitica, Shigella sonnei, Legionella gormanii, and Campylobacter jejuni had increased resistance to free chlorine residuals. Bacteria could be cultured from within treated protozoans well after the time required for 99% inactivation of free-living cells. All bacterial pathogens were greater than 50-fold more resistant to free chlorine when ingested by T. pyriformis. Escherichia coli ingested by a Cyclidium sp., a ciliate isolated from a drinking water reservoir, were also shown to be more resistant to free chlorine. The mechanism that increased resistance appeared to be survival within protozoan cells. This study indicates that bacteria can survive ingestion by protozoa. This bacterium-protozoan association provides bacteria with increased resistance to free chlorine residuals which can lead to persistence of bacteria in chlorine-treated water. We propose that resistance to digestion by predatory protozoa was an evolutionary precursor of pathogenicity in bacteria and that today it is a mechanism for survival of fastidious bacteria in dilute and inhospitable aquatic environments.
TI  - Thermal inactivation of Campylobacter species, Yersinia enterocolitica, and hemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 in fluid milk.
AB  - Heat treatment of raw milk in an HTST pasteurizer operated at 60.0 to 72.0 degrees C for a minimum holding time of 16.2 s rapidly inactivated mixtures of hemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7, Yersinia enterocolitica and Campylobacter spp. (C. fetus, C. coli, and C. jejuni). Each of the three genera in the mixture was inoculated at a level of approximately 1.0 x 10(5) cfu/ml. At 60.0 degrees C, hemorrhagic E. coli showed a maximum 2 log10 reduction in counts and no viability at greater than or equal to 64.5 degrees C. Yersinia enterocolitica and Campylobacter spp. showed greater heat sensitivity with a 4 log10 reduction in counts at 60.0 degrees C and absence of viable cells at greater than or equal to 63.0 degrees C. These findings reiterate the need for stringent control of thermal processes in the manufacture of dairy products from raw or heat-treated (non-pasteurized) milk.
TI  - Pathogenic bacteria in milk--a review.
AB  - Pathogenic bacteria are transmissible to humans through milk and milk products. Recently, attention is focused on milk, cheese, and ice cream contaminated with pathogenic bacteria, viz., Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, Campylobacter jejuni, and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli. This review presents information on characteristics of these pathogens and illnesses caused by them.
TI  - Diagnosis of infectious diarrheal diseases.
AB  - For many years, microbiologic examination of feces was focused on the isolation of two members of the family Enterobacteriaceae--Salmonellae and Shigellae. Over the past two decades, other enteric pathogens such as the various classes of diarrheagenic E. coli, Campylobacter, Vibrio spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Clostridium difficile have gained prominence. A newly recognized protozoan parasite, Cryptosporidium is now known to infect both immunocompetent and immunodeficient individuals. Added to these is the growing list of viruses incriminated in diarrheal diseases and gastritis. This article provides some of the basic information needed to allow for the isolation and identification of many of the currently recognized enteric pathogens. It also provides information on some of the currently available rapid test procedures that will speed up stool specimen testing and allow for more timely reporting to the physician.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of the new oral macrolide azithromycin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new oral macrolide azithromycin was compared with that of erythromycin against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Ninety percent of hemolytic streptococci groups A and B, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml. Activity of azithromycin was similar to that of erythromycin; erythromycin-resistant staphylococci and streptococci were not inhibited. Azithromycin was more active than erythromycin against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90 1 microgram/ml) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It inhibited Campylobacter spp. and Pasteurella multocida, and had an MIC50 of 8 micrograms/ml for Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp. and Yersinia enterocolitica compared to an erythromycin value of greater than 64 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Isolation of Campylobacter spp. and Yersinia enterocolitica from domestic animals and human patients in Kenya.
AB  - Rectal swabs or faecal samples from 992 domestic animals and 97 human patients in the Nairobi region were cultured for thermophilic Campylobacter species and Yersinia enterocolitica. The highest isolation rate of campylobacters was obtained from diarrhoeic pigs (55.1%), followed by healthy chicken (51.5%), diarrhoeic dogs (47.2%), healthy pigs (44.0%), healthy ducks (29.4%), healthy goats (6.3%), healthy cattle (5.8%), diarrhoeic humans (3.1%), and healthy sheep (2.0%). Only one strain of Y. enterocolitica was obtained. This isolate, which conformed to Nilehn's biotype 1, was recovered from one (0.7%) of the 150 healthy pigs examined. Out of 317 thermophilic campylobacters isolated, 163 (51.4%) were classified as C. jejuni, whereas 127 (40.1%) belonged to C. coli. The remaining 27 strains fell into three categories which did not conform to any defined species. Of the total number of isolates, 74.1% were resistant to metronidazole, 90.9% were resistant to triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC), and 50.2% reduced selenite. The results indicate that domestic animals may play a significant role in the epidemiology of human campylobacteriosis in the Nairobi region by serving as reservoirs. Y. enterocolitica seems to be rare among man and animals in this area.
TI  - Enteropathogens associated with acute infantile diarrhoea in Cape Town.
AB  - The results of a year-long controlled study on the causation of acute infectious  diarrhoea in infants are reported. Campylobacter fetus subspecies jejuni, rotavirus and certain enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) types were identified as the most common enteropathogens. Shigella, Salmonella group B and Yersinia enterocolitica were significant but less common pathogens. Campylobacter, rotavirus, the significant EPEC types and Shigella infections were more frequent in the warm summer and autumn months. This only partially accounts for the marked summer peak of diarrhoea, since at this time the percentage of cases of undetermined causation is highest (61%). Over the year an identifiable cause of the diarrhoea was found in 49% of the patients studied. A specific EPEC type, 0126:K71(B16), appeared to vary in pathogenicity on a seasonal basis. Multiple enteropathogens occurred relatively frequently.
TI  - Acute diarrhoea in adults: aetiology, clinical appearance and therapeutic aspects.
AB  - A prospective study of acute diarrhoea was performed during 15 months 1981/1982 and included 731 patients and 240 controls. 43% had been infected abroad. A cluster of travellers with bacterial pathogens was diagnosed in July-August. The following pathogens were found: Campylobacter (18%), enterotoxigenic E. coli (6%), Salmonella spp. (5%), rotavirus (4%), Yersinia enterocolitica (3%), Giardia lamblia (3%), Shigella spp. (2%), Clostridium difficile (2%), enteroviruses (2%) and Entamoeba histolytica (less than 1%). More than 90% of the bacterial or parasitic enteropathogens were detected in the first stool sample. Only 10% of the patients needed hospital treatment and for 97% oral fluids were sufficient. The median duration of diarrhoea was 9 days. No fatal cases occurred and only 2 cases of chronic bowel disease were detected.
TI  - In vitro activity of azithromycin (CP-62,993), a novel macrolide, against enteric pathogens.
AB  - Azithromycin (CP-62,993 [9-deoxy-9A-methyl-9A-aza-9A-homoerythromycin]) is a novel macrolide antimicrobial. In this study the in vitro activity of CP-62,993 has been determined against selected enteropathogens, including Clostridium difficile, and compared with that of erythromycin. MICs were determined using an agar incorporation technique in Mueller-Hinton medium, containing saponin-lysed horse blood at a final concentration of 10% v/v, with an inoculum of 10(4) cfu. CP-62,993 was considerably more active than erythromycin against Salmonella typhi (MIC90 4 and greater than 32 mg/l, respectively), S. enteritidis (MIC90 4 and greater than 32 mg/l), Shigella flexneri (MIC90 2 and 32 mg/l), Sh. dysenteriae (MIC90 2 and 32 mg/l), Sh. sonnei (MIC90 4 and 32 mg/l), Campylobacter jejuni (MIC90 0.12 and 1 mg/l), Vibrio cholerae (MIC90 0.25 and 8 mg/l), V. parahaemolyticus (MIC90 0.5 and 8 mg/l), Yersinia enterocolitica (MIC90 4 and greater than 32 mg/l), Escherichia coli-ETEC (MIC90 4 and 32 mg/l), E. coli-EIEC (MIC90 4 and greater than 32 mg/l), Plesiomonas shigelloides (MIC90 1 and 8 mg/l) and Aeromonas hydrophila (MIC90 4 and 32 mg/l). CP-62,993 (MIC90 2 mg/l) was slightly less active than erythromycin (MIC90 1 mg/l) against isolates of C. difficile. The results suggest a potential clinical role for CP-62,993 in the treatment of enteric infections where antimicrobial therapy is indicated.
TI  - Frequency of Escherichia coli O157:H7 isolation from stool specimens.
AB  - During a 6-month period, 7252 faeces specimens were examined for Escherichia coli serotype O157:H7. Forty-nine specimens (0.7%) from 19 patients yielded this organism. Escherichia coli O157:H7 was the third most frequently isolated bacterial pathogen, following Campylobacter jejuni and (or) Salmonella sp. Although regional variation between laboratories determined whether Campylobacter jejuni or Salmonella was the primary bacterial pathogen isolated, E. coli O157:H7 was consistently isolated more frequently than either Shigella or Yersinia enterocolitica.
TI  - Acute gastroenteritis in children attending day-care centres with special reference to rotavirus infections. I. Aetiology and epidemiologic aspects.
AB  - Acute gastroenteritis (GE) among 214 children (aged 6 months-7 years) attending day-care centres (DDCs) in the Copenhagen County was studied during a 12-month period. A total of 197 cases of GE was observed in 109 children (i.e. 51% of the participants). The aetiology was as follows: rotavirus (n = 48) (24%), pathogenic bacteria (n = 11) (6%), Giardia lamblia (n = 3) (2%), while the aetiology of 68% remains unknown. The pathogenic bacteria included Yersinia enterocolitica, thermophilic Campylobacter, Clostridium difficile (+/- toxin) and enteropathogenic E. coli. In 4% of the GE the infections were multiple and Cryptosporidium was seen in one of these cases. The rate of GE declined with age from 1.35 GE per child per year (age group 1.0- less than 2.0 years) to 0.36 (6.0- less than 8.0 years). Serum sampled at the start of the study period showed that the frequency of detectable rotavirus IgG increased with age from 48% in the 6 months- less than 1.0 year group to 96% in the 4.0- less than 7.0 year group. The highest rates of rotavirus GE occurred from January to April (i.e. the rotavirus season). Moreover, rotavirus GE was almost absent after the age of 4. Hence, the rates of rotavirus GE per rotavirus season per child were 0.80 (age group 6 months-less than 1.0 year), 0.32 (1.0-less than 2.0), 0.14 (2.0-less than 3.0), 0.16 (3.0-less than 4.0), 0.06 (4.0-less than 5.0) and 0.04 (5.0-less than 6.0). Only 2 out of the 48 rotavirus GE were reinfections.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of lysozyme against bacteria involved in food spoilage and food-borne disease.
AB  - Egg white lysozyme was demonstrated to have antibacterial activity against organisms of concern in food safety, including Listeria monocytogenes and certain strains of Clostridium botulinum. We also found that the food spoilage thermophile Clostridium thermosaccharolyticum was highly susceptible to lysozyme and confirmed that the spoilage organisms Bacillus stearothermophilus and Clostridium tyrobutyricum were also extremely sensitive. Several gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated from food poisoning outbreaks, including Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella typhimurium, and Yersinia enterocolitica, were all resistant. The results of this study suggest that lysozyme may have selected applications in food preservation, especially when thermophilic sporeformers are problems, and as a safeguard against food poisoning caused by C. botulinum and L. monocytogenes.

TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of A-56268 (TE-031) against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and Chlamydia trachomatis.
AB  - The in vitro activity of A-56268 (TE-031) was determined and compared with that of 13 antibiotics against 401 gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and 11 strains of Chlamydia trachomatis. A-56268 was very active against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and was among the most active of the agents tested against Listeria monocytogenes, streptococci and Chlamydia trachomatis. It was moderately active against Haemophilus spp., Vibrio spp., Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter fetus subsp. fetus. It was inactive against enterococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Campylobacter coli, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp. and Yersinia enterocolitica. A-56268 was not consistently bactericidal or more active than erythromycin for any organism except Chlamydia trachomatis.
TI  - Raw beef, pork and chicken in Japan contaminated with Salmonella sp., Campylobacter sp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Clostridium perfringens--a comparative study.
AB  - One hundred and twenty samples each of raw ground beef, pork and chicken from ten local grocery stores in Shimane Prefecture, Japan, were examined for the presence of Salmonella sp. (Sal), Campylobacter jejuni (Cj), Campylobacter coli (Cc), Yersinia enterocolitica (Ye), and Clostridium perfringens (Cp) from April 1984 to March 1985. A total of 205 isolates of Sal (112 strains), Cj (64 strains), Cc (one strain), Ye (7 strains) and Cp (21 strains) were recovered from 17 beef (14.2%), 31 pork (25.8%) and 94 chicken (78.3%) of 120 samples each. Sal biogroup 1 was found in 8.3% of beef, 13.3% of pork and 35.0% of chicken, Sal biogroup 2 in 0.8% of beef, 4.2% of pork and 14.2% of chicken, Cj in 1.7% of beef and pork and 50.0% of chicken, Cc in 0.8% of pork, Ye serotype 03 was found in 5.0% of pork, and Cp in 1.7% of beef and pork and 10.8% of chicken. These enteropathogens were recovered concomitantly from two pork and 31 chicken samples, especially Sal and Cj. Sal was counted at less than or equal to 10(2)/100 g of beef and pork and at less than or equal to 10(3)/100 g of chicken, Cj was counted at less than or equal to 10(1)/g of beef and pork and at less than or equal to 10(2)/g of chicken, Ye serotype 03 was counted at less than or equal to 10(3)/g of pork, Cp was counted at less than or equal to 10(2)/g of pork and at less than or equal to 10(2)g of chicken, and Cc from pork and Cp from beef were recovered by using enrichment culture. This investigation showed that a second-contamination of Sal and Cj from chicken to beef and pork frequently occurred during the warm months of the year. It was suggested that chicken may become a source of infection with plural organisms of enteric pathogens, especially Sal and Cj, at the same time all the year round, and that pork may be an important source of infection with Ye during the cold months.
TI  - Susceptibility of Campylobacter jejuni and Yersinia enterocolitica to UV radiation.
AB  - Two enteric pathogens, Campylobacter jejuni and Yersinia enterocolitica serogroup O:3, together with Escherichia coli, were investigated for susceptibility to UV radiation at 254 nm. The UV dose required for a 3-log reduction (99.9% inactivation) of C. jejuni, Y. enterocolitica, and E. coli was 1.8, 2.7, and 5.0 mWs/cm2, respectively. Using E. coli as the basis for comparison, it appears that C. jejuni and Y. enterocolitica serogroup O:3 are more sensitive to UV than many of the pathogens associated with waterborne disease outbreaks and can be easily inactivated in most commercially available UV reactors. No association was found between the sensitivity of Y. enterocolitica to UV and the presence of a 40- to 50-megadalton virulence plasmid.
TI  - Childhood enteritis: a community study.
AB  - The population aged 0-12 years living in the area of an Italian Local Health Unit (about 8,800 children) was studied for one year in order to estimate the overall incidence rate of enteritis and the incidence rates of diarrheas from bacterial agents. All children complaining of acute diarrhea and seen by the pediatric practices of the study area were recorded by date, age, and sex; the microbiological study of stools was performed for a sample of patients. All hospitalized cases of childhood enteritis occurring in the same period in the study population were studied too. Campylobacter jejuni and Salmonella were cultured from 5 out of 71 examined out-patients (7.0%), with a projected annual consultation rate of 2.1 per 1000 population aged 0-12 years. Yersinia enterocolitica was cultured from 2 out-patients (2.8%), while no cases from Shigella and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli were observed in this group. Data concerning hospitalized cases confirmed this pattern of results. Bacterial enteritis is an important public health problem in the study area and its occurrence is possibly related to animal reservoirs of infection, with particular regard to poultry and pets.
TI  - The comparative activity of pefloxacin, enoxacin, ciprofloxacin and 13 other antimicrobial agents against enteropathogenic microorganisms.
AB  - In this study, we compared the activity of pefloxacin, enoxacin and ciprofloxacin against 269 enteropathogenic strains (Campylobacter jejuni, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Shigella spp., Vibrio cholerae and Yersinia enterocolitica) with that of rosoxacin, flumequin, nifuroxazide, erythromycin, chloramphenicol, ampicillin, cefotaxime, tetracycline, amikacin, netilmicin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim and co-trimoxazole. Pefloxacin, enoxacin and ciprofloxacin were always among the most active compounds. Furthermore, resistant strains or strains with elevated MIC values were not found. The MIC90 value for these three compounds was less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l, except for C. jejuni where it was 0.3 mg/l and 1.4 mg/l for pefloxacin and enoxacin, respectively.
TI  - The relative importance of various enteropathogens as a cause of diarrhoea in hospitalized children in Chiang Mai, Thailand.
AB  
TI  - Bacterial diarrhoea.
AB  - Bacterial infections are important causes of diarrhoea in infants and children, particularly in developing countries and in other settings where standards of personal and community hygiene are low. Knowledge of bacterial diarrhoeas has been significantly expanded in recent years by the finding that many episodes of acute diarrhoea are due to infections with bacteria which produce enterotoxins that interfere with intestinal fluid and electrolyte transport (the 'enterotoxigenic' diarrhoeas). Several 'newer' bacterial agents have also been identified which would not have been detected in earlier studies of the epidemiology of infective diarrhoeas; these include Aeromonas, Campylobacter, Clostridium difficile and Yersinia. Another important advance has been new knowledge about mechanisms by which bacteria cause diarrhoea; this has led to the widespread successful application of oral rehydration therapy in treatment of acute watery diarrhoeas.
TI  - Lipopolysaccharide structures in Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and  Vibrio cholerae are immunologically related to Campylobacter spp.
AB  - To determine whether lipopolysaccharide (LPS) structures of Campylobacter species are immunologically related to those of 11 other gram-negative organisms, we immunoblotted from polyacrylamide gels the LPS of these strains with immune rabbit serum raised against six Campylobacter jejuni strains and two Campylobacter fetus strains. The LPS studied were from Salmonella minnesota wild type and Ra to Re mutants, Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Vibrio cholerae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. None of the 11 LPS preparations was recognized by the eight antisera, but antisera to each of the Campylobacter strains recognized core determinants of some LPS preparations. Antiserum directed against the most serum-sensitive C. jejuni strain, 79-193, was the only antiserum sample that recognized core regions of the rough Salmonella mutants. In converse experiments, when LPS preparations from five Campylobacter strains were blotted with antiserum to Salmonella lipid A, recognition of core structures of each was shown; data from an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay confirmed this result. In contrast, antiserum to Salmonella typhimurium Re LPS showed no reactivity. We conclude that LPS of Campylobacter strains share lipid A antigenic determinants with the core region of LPS of several other gram-negative organisms.
TI  - Prevalence of various enteropathogens in the feces of diarrheic and healthy calves.
AB  - The presence of various enteropathogens was examined in the feces of homebred dairy calves reared in a restricted geographical area of France (North West of County of Indre-et-Loire) during winter 1983-1984. Two distinct surveys were carried on: a case-control study including 32 diarrheic calves and 21 healthy calves bred in 53 different farms; and a separate study on nine diarrheic calves in another farm. The following infectious agents were looked for, by specific methods of detection: Escherichia coli K99 and E. coli lethal for mice, Salmonella species, Yersinia enterocolitica, Campylobacter jejuni, enterotoxigenic Clostridium perfringens, Chlamydia psittaci, rotaviruses, coronaviruses, Cryptosporidium. In the case-control survey, no enterotoxigenic E. coli (K99+) was detected in either group of calves. Four agents were more often detected in diarrheic calves than in healthy calves, i.e. rotavirus (12/32 vs 1/21), lethal E. coli (6/32 vs 1/21), Cryptosporidium (2/32 vs 0/21) and Salmonella typhimurium (1/32 vs 0/21). One at least of these four agents was present in 16 diarrheic calves (50%) vs only 2 healthy calves (10%) (P less than 0.01). On the other hand, the occurrence of Campylobacter jejuni and of C. perfringens, enterotoxin was similar in both groups of calves, accounting respectively for about 20% and 10% of total calves. Moreover, coronavirus-like particles were significatively associated with healthy calves (7/32 vs 11/21; P less than 0.05). In the other study, all the main categories of enteropathogens were detected throughout the period of observation in the same farm with the exception of enterotoxigenic E. coli. But each calf taken individually was rarely shedding more than two agents at a time. In addition, specific antibodies against C. perfringens enterotoxin, as tested in an ELISA test, were present in the serum of all the calves examined in both surveys. This study confirms the primary role of rotavirus and Cryptosporidium as agents of diarrhea in calves under three weeks. It also suggests the possible participation of E. coli strains that are lethal for mice and underlines the potential hazard for human health of bovine reservoirs of Campylobacter jejuni and enterotoxigenic C. perfringens.
TI  - [Epidemiology, etiology and laboratory diagnosis of infectious diarrhea diseases  in the tropics].
AB  - Diarrhoeal diseases belong to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in tropical countries, especially in infants and small children. About one billion episodes are estimated for this group of age with 4.6 million fatalities. Many causes are discussed to explain the high incidence: bottle feeding of infants, protein malnutrition, unsafe drinking water and unsafe disposal of excrements and sewage, unsufficient consciousness of personal and domestic hygiene, lack of knowledge on the origin of disease, and inadequate food hygiene. Among the viral infectious agents rotavirus is isolated from 30-40% of enteritis cases in infants and small children; Norwalk virus, adenovirus and human calicivirus, too, appear to occur worldwide. Enteropathogenic (EPEC) and, especially, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are of primary importance as bacterial pathogens. Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli primarily cause disease in infants and small children. Shigellae are important whereas salmonellae are less frequently identified as a cause for diarrhoeal illness. Yersinia enterocolitica is rare in tropical countries. Cholera and infections with other vibrionaceae (V. cholerae non-01, V. mimicus, V. parahaemolyticus, aeromonas, Plesiomonas shigelloides) mainly occur in coastal areas. Clostridium perfringens type C is the causal agent of Enteritis necroticans in several countries, especially New Guinea. C. difficile appears to be of minor importance. Among the parasites Giardia lamblia and Entamoeba histolytica are the most important organisms causing diarrhoeal disease. Macroscopic (visible blood) and microscopic stool examination (faecal leukocytes) may be helpful in dysenteric disease to distinguish between shigella and E. histolytica infections; it is, however, of limited usefulness to discriminate between organisms causing watery diarrhoea.
TI  - Faecal bacteria of wild ruminants and the alpine marmot.
AB  - Faecal samples from 60 red deer (Cervus elaphus), 13 roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), 7 chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra), 41 alpine marmot (Marmota marmota) and soils mixed with deer faeces from the Stelvio National Park were examined for Campylobacter sp. and Salmonella sp. with negative results. The same material, especially deer faeces, was a habitat highly suitable for Yersinia sp.: Y. enterocolitica (two biotypes) was isolated twice, Y. kristensenii (two serotypes) was isolated 19 times, Y. frederiksenii and Y. intermedia were isolated once. Antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli were isolated from 16 specimens from wild ruminants, one from marmot and two from feeding places.
TI  - Cadmium chloride susceptibility, a characteristic of Campylobacter spp.
AB  - We report a simple diagnostic characteristic useful in the presumptive identification of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli. Filter paper disks impregnated with cadmium chloride were placed on streaked agar medium. Zones of growth inhibition for Campylobacter spp. occurred at 1.25 micrograms per disk. Other enteropathogens (Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Escherichia coli, and Yersinia enterocolitica) were resistant to at least 40 micrograms per disk, with the exception of a strain of Shigella flexneri, which showed first susceptibility at 10 micrograms per disk. Most of the 52 Campylobacter strains, which were isolated from human clinical and animal sources, showed zones of inhibition greater than 10 mm with 2.5 micrograms of cadmium chloride per disk. At 20 micrograms per disk, Campylobacter isolates from clinical sources were significantly (P less than 0.01) more susceptible to cadmium chloride inhibition than were those from meat samples.
TI  - Microbiological aspects of goat's milk. A Public Health Laboratory Service survey.
AB  - In a 12-month survey (June 1982-May 1983) 41 laboratories examined 2493 samples of goat's milk for colony counts and the presence of pathogens. The statutory tests for cow's milk were also applied. Surface counts of less than 10(5) organisms per ml of raw milk were given by 79% of samples at 37 degrees C and by 76% at 22 degrees C. There were less than 100 coliforms per ml in 71% of samples, less than 10 Escherichia coli per ml in 91%. Staphylococcus aureus was not detected in countable numbers in 96% of samples. Only one isolation of campylobacter was made and two of Yersinia enterocolitica. Salmonella was not detected in 2462 samples. The methylene blue test was carried out on 2368 samples and 86.7% were deemed satisfactory. No sample was Brucella ring-test-positive. Experiments on the survival and growth of six food poisoning organisms in stored goat's milk showed that Bacillus cereus, Staph. aureus, Salmonella typhimurium and Y. enterocolitica survived quite well and multiplied at the higher storage temperature of 30 degrees C. Clostridium perfringens only increased 10- to 100-fold while Campylobacter jejuni did not grow. The results of the survey indicate that any problems with goat's milk relate to poor hygiene during production rather than transmission of organisms from the goat herself.

TI  - A prospective etiological and clinical study on gastroenteritis in Italian children.
AB  - Stool cultures of 188 children hospitalized for gastroenteritis in a two-year period (1981-1982) yielded Salmonella in 25.5%, Campylobacter in 16.0%, and Y. enterocolitica in 3.7% of cases. Rotavirus was identified in 22.3% of cases. Out of 82 lactose-positive microorganisms isolated from as many cases, three (one E. coli and two Klebsiella) produced heat-labile enterotoxin and two E. coli strains a "cytotoxic" toxin (in an HEp-2 in vitro model); two other E. coli strains possessed adhesive properties for HEp-2 cells in vitro; none revealed enteroinvasive for HEp-2 cells. Two out of 70 E. coli strains were EPEC. From stools of 643 childhood out-patients Salmonella was isolated in 9.6% of cases; Campylobacter and Y. enterocolitica in 9.0% and in 0.6% of cases respectively. Rotavirus was not looked for. Shigella strains were not isolated. Among 622 children without gastrointestinal symptoms, five (0.8%) excreted campylobacters and one (0.16%) salmonella. Children of 18-24 months of age were significantly more often infected with Campylobacter. Gross blood in feces, body temperature greater than 38 degrees C, and peripheral leukocytosis were significantly more often associated with Salmonella infection; vomiting and absence of blood in stools and of leukocytosis with rotavirus infection. Other features were not significantly associated with the etiological agent of the illness. Except for Salmonella infections, the enteritis cases did not show any pronounced seasonal pattern.
TI  - [Pathogenesis, clinical aspects and diagnosis of the most important enteric bacterial diseases in animals].
AB  - There are adhesive and invasive species among enteropathogenic bacteria for animals. Most frequently isolated adhesive bacteria are enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC). Salmonella, T. hyodysenteriae, M. paratuberculosis, Y. enterocolitica, Cl. perfringens and C. jejuni bacteria represent the most important invasive germs. The main clinical finding connected with bacterial enteritis is diarrhoea resp. dysentery. Evaluation of feces consistency, time of appearance and accompanying symptoms (e.g. fever, colic) allow a clinical suspective diagnosis, however a definitive diagnosis must be based on the demonstration of the causative agent. In addition to known cultural, microscopic, biochemical and serological diagnostic methods, the demonstration of virulence factors (enterotoxin formation, adhesive pili) plays an important role in diagnosis of enteropathogenic bacteria.

TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of MT-141, a new semisynthetic cephamycin, compared with those of five cephalosporins.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of MT-141 were compared with those of cefoxitin, cefmetazole, moxalactam, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone. The MICs of MT-141 for 90% of bacterial isolates were lower than the reference drugs against clinical isolates of Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium difficile, and Bacteroides fragilis, whereas against clinical isolates of other gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, the MICs of MT-141 were similar to or higher than those of the reference drugs. In contrast, the bactericidal activity of MT-141 after 6- and 24-h exposures was superior to all of the reference drugs against 9 to 10 of the 12 bacterial strains studied, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enteritidis, indol-positive Proteus species, Serratia marcescens, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas cepacia, and Clostridium perfringens. In the treatment of systemic infections in mice, MT-141 was again superior against 9 of the 12 strains tested, showing a good correlation with the bactericidal activity. It was found that the 50% effective doses of the six cephalosporins studied correlated better with the MBCs than with the MICs. As the serum levels of MT-141 in mice after subcutaneous administration were similar to those of the reference drugs, it was concluded that the bactericidal activity of MT-141 was a dominant factor in its in vivo activity.
TI  - Prevalence of enteric pathogens in the feces of healthy beef calves.
AB  - Fecal specimens from 136 healthy beef calves (1 day to 12 weeks of age) were examined for the presence of infectious agents known to cause enteric disease in calves. The calves were selected from 22 herds in which all calves were free of clinically apparent enteric disease. Salmonella sp, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Cryptosporidium, and coronavirus were not detected in any of the calves. Three calves were infected with rotavirus and 1 calf was infected with Yersinia enterocolitica. Campylobacter-like bacteria were isolated from 50 of 130 calves, with 36 of the calves positive for C jejuni. Seemingly, clinically normal calves may be infected more often with enterotoxigenic E coli, Cryptosporidium, coronavirus, or rotavirus in herds in which some calves have enteric disease than in herds free of major enteric disease. Campylobacter jejuni was well adapted to the bovine host and was of similar prevalence in diarrheal and nondiarrheal calves. The K99 positive, nonenterotoxigenic E coli was isolated from the feces of 16 healthy calves. Information in addition to the presence of K99 antigen is useful when diagnosing enterotoxic colibacillosis in calves.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of ciprofloxacin against Campylobacter spp. and other bacterial enteric pathogens.
AB  - A comparison was made of the in vitro activity of ciprofloxacin (Bay o 9867) with nine other antibiotics against isolates of Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Clostridium difficile, Vibrio spp., and Escherichia coli. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin were the lowest of any compound tested for all organisms except C. difficile.
TI  - Enteropathogen carriage by healthy individuals living in an area with poor sanitation.
AB  - Faecal carriage of bacterial enteropathogens (enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), shigellae and salmonellae) was studied in 265 individuals: 65 infants 3-6 months of age (50 bottle-fed and 15 breast-fed), 100 school-age children 8-10 years of age and 100 adults 21-50 years of age. All were apparently healthy, did not have gastrointestinal symptoms, had not received antibiotics in the preceding fortnight and were not malnourished. Enteropathogens were isolated from the faeces of 24 individuals (9.1%). Cultures were positive for enteropathogens in 20% of the infants (both breast- and bottle-fed), 8% of school-age children and 3% of the adults. EPEC was the most frequent isolate. Twelve different serotypes were detected. The highest recoveries were E. coli 026:K60 and 044 . K74. Shigella was detected only in school-age children (2%) and salmonella only in adults (1%). Campylobacter jejuni and Yersinia enterocolitica were studied only in the school-age children: there was one isolate of each of them. Most enteropathogens isolated were susceptible to the majority of the antibiotics tested. Only four E. coli strains, isolated from bottle-fed infants, could be considered multi-resistant. Two of the strains wer E. coli 044:K74 and 020a020c:K61. The remainder were E. coli 0111:K58 and wee capable of transferring some of their antibiotic resistance traits to a recipient strain.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of ten antimicrobial agents against bacterial enteropathogens.
AB  - The in vitro susceptibilities of 50 strains of Salmonella spp., 80 strains of Shigella spp., and 50 enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, 14 Yersinia enterocolitica, 6 Aeromonas hydrophila, 4 Plesiomonas shigelloides, 9 Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and 30 Campylobacter jejuni strains that were recently isolated from worldwide sources were determined for 10 antimicrobial agents. The antimicrobial agents tested included ampicillin, bicozamycin, doxycycline, enoxacin (CI-919), erythromycin, furazolidone, amdinocillin, norfloxacin, trimethoprim, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Ampicillin resistance occurred frequently in strains of Salmonella and Shigella spp. and enterotoxigenic E. coli strains. The most active agents against all of the bacteria tested were enoxacin and norfloxacin. Furazolidone and amdinocillin were also highly active against the majority of strains. Trimethoprim and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were inhibitory at low concentrations against all test except C. jejuni isolates. The in vitro results of this study confirm the high prevalence of bacterial resistance to ampicillin. However, this work also identifies four antimicrobial agents, enoxacin, furazolidone, norfloxacin, and amdinocillin, that would be appropriate for further testing in clinical trials.
TI  - Food microbiology update. Emerging foodborne pathogens.
AB  - A review of three "emerging" foodborne pathogen groups is presented, including Campylobacter jejuni/coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, and foodborne Vibrio sp.
TI  - Symptomatic and asymptomatic rotavirus infections in hospitalized children.
AB  - During one year, 871 infants and children admitted to a Dutch paediatric ward were examined weekly for rotavirus. Rotavirus was detected in the stools of 64/129 (49.6%) children with diarrhoea and in 283/742 (38.1%) controls. The incidence of asymptomatic rotavirus excretors increased from 14.5% in infants 0 to 6 months of age to 65.8% in children of 6 years and over, a feature not yet reported. Possible explanations may be the methodology used, the age groups studied, the local hospital (and community) situation and the geographical location. Routine bacteriology revealed enteropathogens in 25.6% of the children with diarrhoea: Salmonellae in 20.9%, Campylobacter jejuni in 3.9%, Yersinia enterocolitica in 1.5%, Shigella sonnei in 0.8% and enteropathogenic E. coli in 0.8% of the patients.
TI  - A longitudinal study of the prevalence of bacterial enteric pathogens among adults with diarrhea in Bangkok, Thailand.
AB  - Six hundred sixty adults with diarrhea treated at Bamrasnaradura hospital, Bangkok, Thailand were investigated to determine the prevalence, seasonality, and severity of diarrhea associated with bacterial enteric pathogens in 1980 and 1981. Shigella were isolated from 27% and Vibrio parahaemolyticus from 19% of the patients studied. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (5%), Salmonella (3%), non-01 Vibrio cholerae (3%), Campylobacter jejuni (1%), and Group F vibrio (less than 1%) were isolated from a smaller proportion of the patients. Shigella infections were most common in July-September, during the period of maximum rainfall in Thailand, while V. parahaemolyticus was isolated most frequently in September and October at the end of the rainy season. 0-1 Vibrio cholerae was isolated from 25% of 104 patients studied in the hot, dry spring of 1980, but was not isolated throughout 1981. Patients with cholera passed more watery stools, while those with Salmonella and Shigella most frequently had headaches, and those with Shigella more often had blood in their stools than those with other infections, or in whom no bacterial enteric pathogens were identified. Annual, seasonal, and, from a comparison with other reported surveys, geographical differences exist in the prevalence of bacterial enteric pathogens in adults with diarrhea in tropical developing countries.
TI  - Enteropathogenic agents in children with diarrhoea in rural Zaire.
AB  - A systematic study of enteropathogenic agents in the stools of children was carried out in a rural area of Kivu Province in Zaire in June, 1979. 84 inpatients and 271 outpatients with diarrhoea were investigated together with 117 inpatient and 203 outpatient controls without diarrhoea. Campylobacter jejuni was the most frequently recovered pathogen in both inpatients (24%) and outpatients (13.7%). Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli was the next most common among children presenting as outpatients with diarrhoea (10.3%). Yersinia enterocolitica was isolated for the first time in this region. Rotaviruses were found only in outpatients with diarrhoea, and usually in children under two years of age. C. jejuni and Vibrio cholerae could also be isolated from the faeces of domestic animals living in close contact with these village families. Analysis of the clinical features did not lead to the recognition of a pattern typical of any particular pathogen. Salmonella, Shigella, and enteropathogenic E. coli did not play a significant role in the cases studied.
TI  - Recent advances in management of bacterial diarrhea.
AB  - The number of recognized infectious causes of diarrhea potentially treatable with specific antibiotics has markedly increased within the past ten years. Laboratories are developing and expanding their abilities to deal with these new pathogens. Neither prophylaxis nor specific treatment of diarrhea in travelers is simple, practical, and safe. Although enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli is the most important cause of diarrhea in U.S. travelers to tropical areas, Campylobacter jejuni causes acute diarrhea in persons in the United States about as often as do Salmonella and Shigella. Vibrio parahemolyticus is an important cause of outbreaks of gastroenteritis following ingestion of improperly cooked shellfish; Bacillus cereus is important in outbreaks of diarrhea after ingestion of improperly cooked and stored rice in Chinese restaurants. Although Yersinia enterocolitica is probably an important cause of severe enteritis in the United States, imperfect techniques for its isolation and lack of good serologic tests have hampered recognition of its importance. Practical means for diagnosing antibiotic-associated colitis and the role of Clostridium difficile toxins in this disease are now available. Vancomycin, metronidazole, bacitracin, and cholestyramine are useful in treatment of antibiotic-associated colitis.

AB  - Stool specimen from 994 patients with Acute Diarrhoeal Diseases were processed for bacterial agents known to be responsible for acute diarrhoea. These were from patients seen at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital over a 9 month period. The pattern that emerged showed Shigella isolates made up by 36 flexneri; 29 boydii, 21 dysenteriae and 4 sonnei; Salmonella isolates were typhi 3, typhimurium 12, enteritidis 3, Oranienburg 9, others 8; Yersinia enterocolitica 14; Campylobacter species 20; Enterotoxinogenic E. coli 12, Vibrio cholerae 5; Enteropathogenic E. coli 35; Enterotoxinogenic E. coli 12; Enteroinvasive E. coli 5. Shigella was by far the most common with 43.6% of the isolates EPEC with 17% Salmonella 12% Campylobacter species 9.7%. Yersinia enterocolitica 6.7% ETEC 6%, Vibrio cholera 2.5% and EIEC 2.5%. The isolates are discussed in relation to age groups and seasons of the year. Oral glucose-electrolyte therapy was evaluated in 48 infants with acute diarrhoea. Pcv, electrolyte, Blood Urea, gain in body weight and fluid intake were monitored. Acceptability and effectiveness of the ORT in our Community were confirmed. There was no excess gain in body weights or puffiness of face and eyelids in the study subjects.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of norfloxacin (MK-0366, AM-715) and other agents against gastrointestinal tract pathogens.
AB  - A comparison was made of the in vitro activities of norfloxacin and of nine other orally administered antibacterial agents against 180 clinical isolates representing the bacterial species most frequently implicated in infections of the gastrointestinal tract in humans. The 90% minimal inhibitory concentrations showed norfloxacin to be 4, 15, 4, 17, 17, 17, and 33 times more active than the next best compound tested against Campylobacter fetus subsp. jejuni, Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and Yersinia enterocolitica, respectively, with an overall 90% minimal inhibitory concentration of less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. Norfloxacin was least active against Clostridium difficile (90% minimal inhibitory concentration, 128 micrograms/ml). These results should encourage further evaluation of norfloxacin as a potential chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of enteric bacterial infections for which antibiotic therapy is indicated.
TI  - Diarrhoea in Swedish infants. Aetiology and clinical appearance.
AB  - Ninety-five children with gastroenteritis admitted at the Department of Paediatrics, Malmo General Hospital, Malmo, Sweden, starting November 1978 through October 1979 were studied. Patients were examined clinically and the course of their disease was followed. Stool specimens from all patients were analysed by routine bacteriology and rotavirus identification was done by immune-electroos-mophoresis. Fifty-eight per cent of patients had rotavirus. Campylobacter was found in 6%, enteropathogenic E. coli in 2%, Yersinia enterocolitica in 2% and Salmonella in 1% of patients. Stool specimens from 53 healthy children matched for sex and age served as controls for bacterial pathogens. All were negative. Forty per cent of patients presented with a clinical dehydration, but only 11%-half of them with bacterial enteropathogens-needed i.v. therapy and 4% required antibiotic treatment. Median time for hospitalization was three days. Vomiting, fever, watery diarrhoea and initial clinical dehydration were more commonly associated with rota virus infection. Macroscopic blood in stools was restricted to patients with bacterial aetiology.
TI  - Gastroenteritis in a regional hospital in Kuwait: some aspects of the disease.
AB  - A review of the clinical course of gastroenteritis in 274 hospitalized children revealed a severe form of the disease. Eight-eight per cent were aged 12 months or under and 20% had severe associated malnutrition. The commonest clinical manifestations were diarrhoea (100%), dehydration (98.9%), vomiting (81.4%) and fever (77.7%). Pathogens were isolated from 75.2% of cases (rotavirus 24.5%, Escherichia coli 20.8%, salmonellae 20%, shigellae 6.2%, campylobacter 2.2% and Yersinia enterocolitica in 1.5%). Septicaemia was confirmed in 12 patients (4.4%) and strong clinical evidence of septicaemia was present in 36 more cases (13%). Dehydration was isonatraemic in 68%, hyponatraemic in 21% and hypernatraemic in 11% of cases. There was a clear association between septicaemia and hyponatraemia. The overall mortality rate was 1.8%. Data from our study show that the use of intravenous hyperalimentation, and/or antibiotics in the management of gastroenteritis in selected patients, can significantly reduce morbidity and mortality.

TI  - Epidemiology of campylobacter enteritis.
AB  - Campylobacter jejuni/coli (CJC) was isolated from 386 patients (6.9%) of 5571 with a history of acute diarrhoea between December 1977 and June 1980. In the same study population Salmonella was found in 4.1%, Shigella in 1.7% and Yersinia enterocolitica in 2.1%. Only 5 (0.25%) of 2000 health controls had CJC in their stools. 53% of the patients had acquired their infection in Sweden. The peak incidence for CJC was from July to September. More than 50% of the patients were between 16-35 years. Within 1 month of the acute enteritis 80% had negative stool cultures for CJC. In general, campylobacter enteritis is not a severe disease and only 11% were admitted to hospital. The most common signs were high fever in 35%, frequent watery diarrhoea in 37%, colics or abdominal pains in 84%, and fresh blood in stools in 12%. Antibiotic treatment was given in 13% and was erythromycin in 56% and doxycycline in 26% of these patients. If chemotherapy was given and the strain was sensitive, no relapse occurred within 2 weeks of the treatment. The antibiograms for 435 strains showed that the aminoglycosides, erythromycin, doxycycline, chloramphenicol and nalidixic acid were the most effective drugs. This study implies that CJC is a common cause of bacterial diarrhoea also in patients with domestic enteritis.

TI  - Travelers' diarrhea among American Peace Corps volunteers in rural Thailand.
AB  - Diarrheal disease was studied prospectively in 35 Peace Corps volunteers during their first five weeks in rural Thailand. Twenty (57%) developed the syndrome of travelers' diarrhea. Recognized bacterial enteric pathogens were isolated from stools during 47% of 39 episodes of travelers' diarrhea. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli was isolated during 26% and Shigella during 13% of the episodes. Of the 20 volunteers, 50% had bacteriologic and/or serologic evidence of infection with enterotoxigenic E. coli. Sixty-one percent of isolates of enterotoxigenic E. coli and 92% of isolates of Shigella were resistant to doxycycline. Other enteric pathogens, including Campylobacter jejuni/coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella, rotavirus, Norwalk agent, and Entamoeba histolytica, were associated with episodes of travelers' diarrhea. Aeromonas hydrophila, isolated from 31% of 39 episodes of travelers' diarrhea, was of unknown pathogenic importance. Thus, episodes of travelers' diarrhea in Thailand were associated with a variety of organisms, among which antibiotic-resistant bacterial enteropathogens were common.
