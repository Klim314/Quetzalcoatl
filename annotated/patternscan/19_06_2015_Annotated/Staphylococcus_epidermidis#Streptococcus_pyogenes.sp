TI  == development of gendine coated cannula for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion for extended use.
AB  == continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (csii) using pumps is a widely used method for insulin therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus. one of the major factors that usually lead to the discontinuation of csii is csii set related issues including infection at the infusion site. current american diabetic association recommends rotating sites every 2-3 days. this adds cost and creates  inconvenience. therefore, in order to prevent infections and extend durations between insertion site changes, we have developed a teflon cannula coated with the combination of gentian violet and chlorhexidine (gendine) and tested its antimicrobial efficacy against different pathogens. cannulas were coated with gendine on exterior surface and dried. efficacy and durability of gendine cannulas was determined against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin- susceptible staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans and candida glabrata using biofilm colonization method. cytotoxicity of gendine was assessed against mouse fibroblast cell lines. gendine cannulas showed complete prevention of biofilm colonization of all organisms tested up to 2 weeks (p < 0.0001) compared to uncoated control. gendine catheter against mouse fibroblast cells shown to be non-cytotoxic. our in vitro results show that a novel gendine cannula is highly effective in completely inhibiting biofilm of multi-drug resistant pathogens for  up to 2 weeks and may have potential clinical applications such as prolonged use, cost reduction and decreased infection rate.

TI  == chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils of pinus peuce (pinaceae) growing wild in r. macedonia.
AB  == the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils isolated from twigs with needles (t+n) and from twigs without needles (t-n) from  wild pinus peuce griseb. (pinaceae), from three different locations in r. macedonia, were investigated. essential oil yields of t+n ranged from 7.5 ml/kg to 12.5 ml/kg and for t-n from 13.8 ml/kg to 17.3 ml/kg. gc/fid/ms analysis of the essential oils revealed eighty-four components, representing 93.7-95.7% and 91.2-92.0% of the t+n and t-n oils, respectively. the major components in t+n and t-n oils were monoterpenes: alpha-pinene (23.8-39.9%, 21.2-23.3%), camphene (2.2-5.5%, 0.7-2.0%), beta-pinene (10.1-17.1%, 8.2-16.4%), myrcene (1.2-1.41%, 1.6-2.5%), limonene+beta-phellandrene (6.8-14.0%, 8.8-23.6%) and bornyl acetate (2.3-6.9%, 1.1-3.4%), followed by the sesquiterpenes: trans-(e)-caryophyllene (3.6-4.3%, 3.2-7.3%), germacrene d (7.1-9.5%, 5.0-10.3%) and delta-cadinene (2.1-3.1%, 3.3-4.2%, respectively). antimicrobial screening of the essential oils was made by disk diffusion and broth dilution methods against 13 bacterial isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and one strain of candida albicans. t-n essential oils showed antimicrobial activity toward streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis and candida albicans as well as streptococcus agalactiae, acinetobacter spp. and haemophilus influenzae. the antimicrobial activity of t+n essential oils was greater, especially against streptococcus agalactiae, s. pyogenes, enterococcus and candida albicans, followed by haemophilus influenzae, acinetobacter spp., escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of all tested essential oils ranged from 15-125  mul/ml. summarizing the obtained results, the antimicrobial activity of pinus peuce t+n and t-n essential oils collected from different localities in r. macedonia varied considerably. these alterations in the antimicrobial activity can be attributed to the differences in the quantitative composition and percentage amounts of the components present in the respective essential oils, although it was evident that there were no differences in the qualitative composition of the essential oils, regardless of the locality of collection, or the type of plant material (t+n or t-n).

TI  == synthesis and structure-activity relationship of amidine derivatives of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene as novel antibacterial agents.
AB  == current antibacterial chemotherapeutics are facing an alarming increase in bacterial resistance pressuring the search for novel agents that would expand the available therapeutic arsenal against resistant bacterial pathogens. in line with these efforts, a series of 9 amidine derivatives of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene were synthesized and, together with 18 previously synthesized analogs, evaluated  for their relative dna binding affinity, in vitro antibacterial activities and preliminary in vitro safety profile. encouraging antibacterial activity of several subclasses of tested amidine derivatives against gram-positive (including resistant mrsa, mrse, vre strains) and gram-negative bacterial strains was observed. the bis-phenyl derivatives were the most antibacterially active, while  compound 19 from bis-benzimidazole class exhibited the widest spectrum of activity (with mic of 4, 2, 0.5 and </=0.25 mug/ml against laboratory strains of  staphyloccocus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, moraxella catarrhalis, respectively and 4-32 mug/ml against clinical isolates of  sensitive and resistant s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecium) and also demonstrated the strongest dna binding affinity (deltatm of 15.4 degrees c). asymmetrically designed compounds and carboxamide-amidines were, in general, less active. molecular docking indicated that the shape of the 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene derivatives and their ability to form multiple electrostatic and hydrogen bonds with dna, corresponds to the binding modes of other minor-groove binders. herein reported results encourage further investigation of this class of compounds as novel antibacterial dna binding agents.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of azd0914, a new spiropyrimidinetrione dna gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent activity against gram-positive, fastidious gram-negative, and atypical bacteria.
AB  == azd0914 is a new spiropyrimidinetrione bacterial dna gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent in vitro antibacterial activity against key gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus agalactiae), fastidious gram-negative (haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae), atypical (legionella pneumophila), and anaerobic (clostridium difficile) bacterial species, including  isolates with known resistance to fluoroquinolones. azd0914 works via inhibition  of dna biosynthesis and accumulation of double-strand cleavages; this mechanism of inhibition differs from those of other marketed antibacterial compounds. azd0914 stabilizes and arrests the cleaved covalent complex of gyrase with double-strand broken dna under permissive conditions and thus blocks religation of the double-strand cleaved dna to form fused circular dna. whereas this mechanism is similar to that seen with fluoroquinolones, it is mechanistically distinct. azd0914 exhibited low frequencies of spontaneous resistance in s. aureus, and if mutants were obtained, the mutations mapped to gyrb. additionally, no cross-resistance was observed for azd0914 against recent bacterial clinical isolates demonstrating resistance to fluoroquinolones or other drug classes, including macrolides, beta-lactams, glycopeptides, and oxazolidinones. azd0914 was bactericidal in both minimum bactericidal concentration and in vitro time-kill studies. in in vitro checkerboard/synergy testing with 17 comparator antibacterials, only additivity/indifference was observed. the potent in vitro antibacterial activity (including activity against fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates), low frequency of resistance, lack of cross-resistance, and bactericidal activity of azd0914 support its continued development.

TI  == a study on the nature of association between demodex mites and bacteria involved  in skin and meibomian gland lesions of demodectic mange in cattle.
AB  == the nature of association between demodex mites and bacteria involved in bovine demodectic mange lesions and the normal flora inhabiting the skin of noninfected  animals was investigated. demodex bovis and d. ghanensis mites were isolated from the infected purulent material extracted from skin and meibomian gland lesions, respectively. the mites could not be demonstrated in skin brushings or impression smears from the eyes of noninfected cattle. pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes (group a)) and opportunistic organisms (proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, and trueperella pyogenes) were isolated from skin lesions of demodectic mange, and moraxella bovis and staphylococcus aureus were isolated from meibomian gland lesions. bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pyogenes (group a) were isolated from skin brushings from noninfected cattle. the nature of association between demodex mites and bacteria in demodectic mange lesions is synergistic and of equal significance. pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria facilitated the establishment of demodex mites in the lesions produced and provided an excellent  microclimate for the mites to propagate and reproduce, resulting in severe and progressive disease. the "high-turnover" granulomatous reaction which characterized the histopathological changes proved that demodex mites and associated bacteria were persistent and immunogenic.

TI  == fusidic acid in skin infections and infected atopic eczema.
AB  == skin infections represent an important public health issue and cost-driver. additionally, chronic skin lesions are sometimes colonized by gram-negative species. topical therapies are a key component in the management of mild-to-moderate skin infections. in such cases, topical antibiotics may be preferable to systemic treatment, since they maximize the effective doses at the  site of infection while minimizing the systemic side effects of the drugs. however, the prevalence of resistant strains is steadily increasing and cases of  sensitization are not uncommon. as a consequence, the ideal topical antibiotic should be selective (thus, minimizing cross-resistance), have weak sensitization  potential, penetrate the skin efficiently, reach adequate local doses at the site of infection, and finally be available in different formulations matching patients' preferences and needs. fusidic acid (fa) is a selective antibiotic available in several topical formulations. pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies have shown that, contrary to other topical antibiotics such as gentamicin or mupirocin, fa reaches high antimicrobial concentration at deep skin layers after topical application either on intact or damaged epidermis. several randomized controlled trials demonstrated that fa, in its various topical formulations, is very effective in treating skin infections, given its high bactericidal activity against s. aureus (including strains resistant to penicillin, methicillin, ampicillin, cloxacillin), s. epidermidis, streptococcus  pyogenes, propionibacterium acnes, corinebatteria, clostridia. additionally, fa presents a low risk of resistance even in methicillin-resistant s. aureus strains, a common pathogen implied in the etiology of skin infections and infected atopic eczema. such feature makes fa particularly useful in the management of these medical conditions. finally, possibly due to its large steric effect, fa has proved a very low risk of contact sensitization. overall, data on  fa efficacy, safety, sensitization potential, resistance profile and spectrum selectivity make it a first-choice option in the treatment of primary and secondary skin infection.

TI  == [identification of staphylococci directly from positive blood culture bottles by  maldi-tof ms system].
AB  == bloodstream infections are substantial causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. staphylococcus species are the most commonly isolated microorganisms from blood cultures in clinical microbiology laboratories. maldi-tof ms (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time- of- flight mass spectrometry)  system allows the identification of microorganisms directly from positive blood culture bottles. the aim of this study was to evaluate the maldi-tof ms system for the identification of staphylococci directly from the positive blood culture  bottles which revealed the presence of gram-positive cocci by staining. a total of 96 positive blood culture bottles that yielded gram-positive cocci by gram stain were evaluated. these blood cultures were obtained from 69 patients between december 2013-february 2014. conventional methods and bd phoenix automated bacterial identification system (becton dickinson, usa) were used for routine identification. the strains were also identified by real-time taqman pcr (qpcr) which was considered as the reference method. in maldi-tof ms method, maldi sepsityper kit was used for the bacterial identification and all measurements were carried out by using microflex lt instrument and flexcontrol 3.0 software (bruker daltonics, usa). of 96 culture bottles positive for gram-positive cocci,  90 were correctly identified as staphylococci at genus level with all the three study methods (qpcr, bd phoenix, bruker maldi-tof ms). the other six samples were identified as enterococcus faecium (n= 4) and streptococcus pyogenes (n= 2) by both phoenix and the maldi-tof systems. of the 90 samples, 87 were identified at  the species level (15 s.aureus, 33 s.epidermidis, 29 s.hominis, 10 s.haemolyticus) and three at the genus level by the reference qpcr method. when comparing the results obtained by qpcr and bruker maldi-tof ms, incompatibility was detected for three isolates. those isolates were identified as s.hominis by qpcr, however two of them were identified as s.haemolyticus and one as s.epidermidis by maldi-tof ms. compared with real-time taqman pcr it was detected that bruker maldi tof ms was identified 100% of s.aureus to the genus and species level and 100% and 96.6% of coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) to the genus and species level, respectively. in conclusion, it was thought that bruker maldi  tof ms system may allow rapid and reliable identification of s.aureus and cns directly from positive blood culture bottles compared with the routine methods used in the clinical microbiology laboratory.

TI  == novel copper (ii) alginate hydrogels and their potential for use as anti-bacterial wound dressings.
AB  == the incorporation of a metal ion, with antimicrobial activity, into an alginate dressing is an attractive approach to minimize infection in a wound. in this work, copper (ii) cross-linked alginate hydrogels were successfully prepared using a two-step cross-linking procedure. in the first step, solid alginate films were prepared using a solvent-casting method from soft gels of alginate solutions that had been lightly cross-linked using a copper (ii) (cu(2+)) sulfate solution. in the second step, the films were further cross-linked in a corresponding cu(2+) sulfate solution using a dipping method to further improve their dimensional stability. alginate solution (at 2%w/v) and cu(2+) sulfate solution (at 2%w/v) in acetate buffer at a low ph provided soft films with excellent swelling behavior.  an increase in either cu(2+) ion concentration or cross-linking time led to hydrogels with more densely-cross-linked networks that limited water absorption.  the hydrogels clearly showed antibacterial activity against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus pyogenes, which was proportional to  the cu(2+) ion concentration. blood coagulation studies showed that the tested copper (ii) cross-linked alginate hydrogels had a tendency to coagulate fibrin, and possibly had an effect on pro-thrombotic coagulation and platelet activation. conclusively, the prepared films are likely candidates as antibacterial wound dressings.

TI  == antimicrobial peptides as potential tool to fight bacterial biofilm.
AB  == recently, the topic of biofilm has met a huge interest of researchers owing to a  significant role played by this microbial life form in severe infections. these well organised three-dimensional microbial communities are characterized by a strong resistance to antimicrobials. biofilms significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality as related infections are very difficult to treat due to  their tendency to relapse after the withdrawal of antibiotics. according to the literature, antimicrobial peptides (amps) have a high potential as future antibiofilm agents. amps can influence various stages of biofilm formation and exhibit antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of microorganisms including multi-drug resistant strains. the purpose of the present study was to determine the activity of antimicrobial peptides against biofilms formed by a variety of bacterial strains. to do this, the following antimicrobial peptides were synthesized: citropin 1.1, lipopeptides palm-kk-nh2 and palm-rr-nh2, omiganan, pexiganan and temporin a. antimicrobial activity of the compounds and conventional antibiotics was determined for planktonic cells and biofilms formed  by reference strains of gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes) and gram-negative (escherichia  coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis) bacteria. amps exhibited a strong antibacterial activity against gram-positive strains, while gram-negative  bacteria were less susceptible. antimicrobial activity of the tested peptides against biofilms formed by gram-positive organisms was significantly stronger as  compared to that of conventional antimicrobials.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of traditional medicinal plants from ankober district, north shewa zone, amhara region, ethiopia.
AB  == context: traditional medicinal plants have long been used in ethiopia to treat human and livestock ailments. despite a well-documented rich tradition of medicinal plant use in the country, their direct antimicrobial effects are still  poorly known. objective: to investigate the antimicrobial activity of 19 medicinal plant species that were selected based on the ethnobotanical information on their traditional use to treat infectious diseases in ankober district. methods: about 23 different ethanol extracts of plants obtained by maceration of various parts of 19 medicinal plant species were studied for potential antimicrobial activity using a broth microdilution method against bacillus cereus, bacteroides fragilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pyogenes. results: plant extracts from embelia schimperi vatke (myrsinaceae) showed the strongest antibacterial activity with a  minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) value of 64 microg/ml against b. cereus, l. monocytogenes, and s. pyogenes. growth inhibitory activities were also observed for extracts of ocimum lamiifolium hochst. (lamiaceae) against s. pyogenes, and those of rubus steudneri schweinf. (rosaceae) against s. epidermidis at an mic value of 128 microg/ml. generally, 74% of ethanol extracts  (17 extracts) showed antimicrobial activity against one or more of the microbial  strains tested at an mic value of 512 microg/ml or below. discussion and conclusions: results confirm the antimicrobial role of traditional medicinal plants of ankober and warrant further investigations on promising medicinal plant species so as to isolate and characterise chemicals responsible for the observed  strong antimicrobial activities.

TI  == rapid detection of gram-positive organisms by use of the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test and the bact/alert pediatric fan system in a multicenter pediatric evaluation.
AB  == assays that expedite the reporting of organism identification and antibiotic susceptibility status in positive blood cultures can fast track interventions that improve clinical outcomes. we evaluated the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test (bc-gp) in two pediatric hospitals. positive bact/alert pediatric fan blood cultures with gram-positive organisms were tested using the bc-gp in tandem with routine laboratory procedures. to test organisms underrepresented in the clinical blood culture evaluation, blood culture bottles  were spiked with diluted organism suspensions at concentrations of 10 to 100 cfu  per milliliter. a total of 249 gram-positive bacterial isolates were recovered from 242 blood cultures. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, and methicillin-resistant s. aureus with sensitivities of 100%, 99%, and 100% and specificities of 100%, 100%, and 99.5%,  respectively. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible s. epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis  with sensitivities of 95%, 80%, and 96%, respectively, and 100% specificity. the  bc-gp correctly identified 14/15 cases of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus  faecium bacteremia and 9 cases of streptococcus pneumoniae. it misidentified 5/15 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis and 1/3 blood cultures spiked with streptococcus anginosus group as s. pneumoniae. the bc-gp detected a case of streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia but failed to detect 2/3 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus agalactiae. bc-gp's rapid accurate detection of staphylococcus spp., e. faecium, and e. faecalis and its ability to  ascertain meca, vana, and vanb status may expedite clinical decisions pertaining  to optimal antibiotic use. false-positive s. pneumoniae results may warrant reporting of only "streptococcus spp." when this organism is reported by the bc-gp.

TI  == [application of pyrosequencing in detection of common pathogens in sepsis].
AB  == objective: to apply pyrosequencing technique in the detection of the common pathogens in sepsis. methods: the primers for amplification and sequencing in pyrosequencing were designed according to alignment of the bacterial 16s rrna sequence. bacterial genomic dna was extracted for pyrosequencing, and the pathogen species were determined according to the sequencing data obtained. results: pyrosequencing effectively yielded the sequencing data of the 28 bp sequences of the pathogens and clearly distinguished the pathogen species of streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumonia, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia, neisseria meningitides, and salmonella, but failed to distinguish staphylococcus epidermidis from staphylococcus aureus. conclusion: pyrosequencing technique can effectively distinguish the common pathogens in sepsis at the species level.

TI  == combination of pantothenamides with vanin inhibitors as a novel antibiotic strategy against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the emergence of resistance against current antibiotics calls for the development of new compounds to treat infectious diseases. synthetic pantothenamides are pantothenate analogs that possess broad-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro  in minimal media. pantothenamides were shown to be substrates of the bacterial coenzyme a (coa) biosynthetic pathway, causing cellular coa depletion and interference with fatty acid synthesis. in spite of their potential use and selectivity for bacterial metabolic routes, these compounds have never made it to the clinic. in the present study, we show that pantothenamides are not active as  antibiotics in the presence of serum, and we found that they were hydrolyzed by ubiquitous pantetheinases of the vanin family. to address this further, we synthesized a series of pantetheinase inhibitors based on a pantothenate scaffold that inhibited serum pantetheinase activity in the nanomolar range. mass spectrometric analysis showed that addition of these pantetheinase inhibitors prevented hydrolysis of pantothenamides by serum. we found that combinations of these novel pantetheinase inhibitors and prototypic pantothenamides like n5-pan and n7-pan exerted antimicrobial activity in vitro, particularly against gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes) even in the presence of serum. these results indicate that pantothenamides, when protected against degradation by host pantetheinases, are potentially useful antimicrobial agents.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of schinus lentiscifolius (anacardiaceae).
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: schinus lentiscifolius marchand (syn. schinus weinmannifolius engl) is a plant native to rio grande do sul (southern brazil) and has been used in brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. material and methods: the crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five gram positive bacteria: bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, three gram negative bacteria: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: candida albicans, candida tropicalis, cryptococcus neoformans, and saccharomyces cerevisiae. the isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two gram positive bacteria, namely, bacillus cereus, enterococcus spp, and six gram negative bacteria, namely, burkholderia cepacia, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and proteus mirabilis. results: the leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of schinus lentiscifolius showed a  broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (mic) against the tested bacteria and fungi. the n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against candida albicans (mic=25 mug/ml), candida tropicalis (mic=15.5 mug/ml), and cryptococcus neoformans, (mic=15.5 mug/ml). from the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of schinus lentiscifolius. conclusion: the antimicrobial activity and some constituents of schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. the results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity and physicochemical properties of a crude methanol extract of the larvae of the blow fly lucilia cuprina.
AB  == the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains has prompted the reintroduction of maggot therapy in the treatment of chronic, infected wounds. many previous studies have demonstrated the potent antibacterial activity of larval excretions/secretions of the blowfly lucilia sericata (meigen) (diptera:calliphoridae) against bacteria. however, the antibacterial activity of  its sibling species, lucilia cuprina (wiedemann) (diptera:calliphoridae) against  a wide range of pathogenic bacteria has never been determined. the aim of this study was to develop a new procedure to produce whole body extract of larvae of l. cuprina via methanol extraction as well as to demonstrate the in vitro antibacterial activity of this extract against seven selected wound pathogens (staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli). the turbidimetric assay demonstrated that l. cuprina larval extract was significantly potent against all bacteria tested (p < 0.001). additionally, colony-forming unit (cfu), agar well diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration assays have confirmed the apparent potency of larval extract against p. aeruginosa. the reconstituted larval extract was highly robust and thermally stable. these observations substantiated the feasibility of the methanol extraction method in the production of larval extract.

TI  == novel bacteriophage lysin with broad lytic activity protects against mixed infection by streptococcus pyogenes and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus [gras]) cause serious and sometimes fatal human diseases.  they are among the many gram-positive pathogens for which resistance to leading antibiotics has emerged. as a result, alternative therapies need to be developed  to combat these pathogens. we have identified a novel bacteriophage lysin (plyss2), derived from a streptococcus suis phage, with broad lytic activity against mrsa, vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus (visa), streptococcus suis, listeria, staphylococcus simulans, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus equi, streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus [gbs]), s. pyogenes, streptococcus sanguinis, group g streptococci (ggs), group e streptococci (ges),  and streptococcus pneumoniae. plyss2 has an n-terminal cysteine-histidine aminopeptidase (chap) catalytic domain and a c-terminal sh3b binding domain. it is stable at 50 degrees c for 30 min, 37 degrees c for >24 h, 4 degrees c for 15  days, and -80 degrees c for >7 months; it maintained full activity after 10 freeze-thaw cycles. plyss2 at 128 mug/ml in vitro reduced mrsa and s. pyogenes growth by 5 logs and 3 logs within 1 h, respectively, and exhibited a mic of 16 mug/ml for mrsa. a single, 2-mg dose of plyss2 protected 92% (22/24) of the mice  in a bacteremia model of mixed mrsa and s. pyogenes infection. serially increasing exposure of mrsa and s. pyogenes to plyss2 or mupirocin resulted in no observed resistance to plyss2 and resistance to mupirocin. to date, no other lysin has shown such notable broad lytic activity, stability, and efficacy against multiple, leading, human bacterial pathogens; as such, plyss2 has all the characteristics to be an effective therapeutic.

(extracted by 80% ethanol) and sauropus androgynus (linn.) merr. (extracted by distilled water) were found to have significant levels of antioxidant activities measured by dpph scavenging (ic5o at 4.92+/-0.01 and 4.71+/-0.01 mg ml-1, respectively) and frap antioxidant assays (74.38+/-0.25 and  74.00+/-0.04 mmol feso4 g-' of dry weight of vegetable, respectively) and also total phenolic compounds (10.96+/-0.02 and 10.34+/-0.01 mg gallic acid eq g-1 of  dry weight of vegetable). for fruits, the extracts derived from terminalia chebula retz. when using distilled water and 80% ethanol as solvents were shown to have significantly high levels of dpph scavenging (ic50 at 3.73+/-0.01 and 3.81+/-0.01 mg ml-1, respectively), frap antioxidant activities (80.85+/-0.10 and 65.93+/-0.11 mmol feso4 g-1of dry weight of fruit, respectively) and total phenolic compounds (13.10+/-0.06 and 10.66+/-0.02 mg gallic acid eq g-1 of dry weight of fruit, respectively). the antibacterial assays showed that moringa oleifera lam., limnophila aromatica (lamk.) merr., terminalia chebula retz. and phyllanthus emblica linn. that were extracted using 80% ethanol as solvent were found to have antibacterial activities against staphylococcus aureus, straphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes and propionibacterium acnes.  the results in this study may be useful for future application of edible plants that are native to thailand to be used as cosmetic or therapqutic products.

TI  == bacterial superinfection in zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis.
AB  == background: zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (zcl) is a polymorphic disease. it is generally accepted that bacterial superinfection may play a role in the clinical appearance of the lesions and may delay or prevent the healing process.  however, the pattern of bacterial pathogens involved has rarely been investigated. material/methods: the aim of this study was to identify the bacterial species contaminating the suspected zcl and their susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics. microscopic examination of stained smears and cultures were used to differentiate zcl from non-zcl lesions in a rural area north of isfahan, iran from july to december 2009. bacteria were isolated from the lesions and identified and antibiotic susceptibility was determined by standard microbiological techniques. results: the results show that 602 (68%) of 855 patients were positive for zcl, of which 83.4% with volcano-shape, 8.8% psoriasiform, 6.6% popular form and 1.2% with other atypical forms of zcl. the bacteria were isolated from 66.8% of zcl (70% of volcano-shape, 60% of psoriasiform and 25% of popular form) and 64.7% of non-zcl lesions. the most common species were staphylococcus aureus (41.7%) and s. epidermidis (28%) followed by bacillus sp. streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., proteus sp., enterobacter sp. and pseudomonas aeroginosa. ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, cefazolin and clindamycin were the most effective antibiotics. conclusions: bacterial superinfection appears to be very common in zcl, but its prevalence is not different from that of non-zcl lesions and it has little effect on the clinical appearance of anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (acl). local  lesion care and management of bacterial superinfection must be considered in the  treatment of zcl.

TI  == lantibiotic production by pathogenic microorganisms.
AB  == lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesised, post-translationally modified antimicrobial peptides produced by gram positive bacteria, many which have broad-ranging antimicrobial activities. lantibiotics have long been the subject of investigation with a view to their application as food preservatives or chemotherapeutic agents for clinical and veterinary medicine, while the associated biosynthetic machinery has been employed for peptide engineering purposes. however, although many lantibiotics are produced by generally regarded  as safe or food-grade bacteria, it is increasingly apparent that a number of gram positive pathogens, including strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus uberis and enterococcus faecalis, also produce these compounds. it is proposed that production of these antimicrobials may provide the associated microorganisms with a competitive advantage when colonizing/infecting  a host, thereby enhancing the virulence of the producing strain. here we review the production of lantibiotics by these pathogens and discuss how their production may contribute to their disease-causing potential.

TI  == identification of conserved antigens from staphylococcal and streptococcal pathogens.
AB  == the design of vaccines containing epitopes shared between different human pathogens may lead to cross-species protection. in order to identify potentially  conserved bacterial antigens, bacteriophage expression libraries of genomic dna from streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes were probed with human sera from staphylococcus aureus-infected and healthy individuals. by comparison with previous screening data from staphylococcus epidermidis and staph. aureus, putative antigenic, conserved domains across the genera were identified. in particular, three potentially antigenic conserved regions were identified based on the n-terminal domain of sacol0609 (sdrd), the c-terminal domain of sacol0723 (scab) and the c-terminus of sacol1140 (isda) from staph. aureus. the three domains were overexpressed, recombinant proteins were purified and polyclonal antisera raised against them recognized cell surface-located proteins from both staphylococcal and streptococcal species. the antisera were also able to opsonize both staph. aureus and strep. agalactiae thereby increasing their phagocytic uptake by human neutrophils. the conserved antigenic domains therefore represent potential cross-protective vaccine candidates.

AB  == td-1792 is a novel glycopeptide-cephalosporin heterodimer investigational antibiotic that displays potent bactericidal effects against clinically relevant  gram-positive organisms in vitro. the present studies evaluated the in vivo pharmacokinetics (pk) and pharmacodynamics (pd) of td-1792 in the neutropenic murine thigh infection animal model. td-1792, dosed subcutaneously (sc), produced dose-dependent reduction in the thigh bacterial burden of several organisms, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis (mssa, mrsa, msse, mrse, respectively), penicillin-susceptible strains of streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp), streptococcus  pyogenes, and vancomycin-intermediate-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (visa). in single-dose efficacy studies, the 1-log(10) cfu kill effective dose (ed(1-log  kill)) estimates for td-1792 ranged from 0.049 to 2.55 mg/kg of body weight administered sc, and the bacterial burden was reduced by up to 3 log(10) cfu/g from pretreatment values. against s. aureus atcc 33591 (mrsa), the total 24-h log(10) stasis dose (ed(stasis)) and ed(1-logkill) doses for td-1792 were 0.53 and 1.11 mg/kg/24 h, respectively, compared to 23.4 and 54.6 mg/kg/24 h for vancomycin, indicating that td-1762 is 44- to 49-fold more potent than vancomycin. pk-pd analysis of data from single-dose and dose-fractionation studies for mrsa (atcc 33591) demonstrated that the total-drug 24-h area under the concentration-time curve-to-mic ratio (auc/mic ratio) was the best predictor  of efficacy (r(2) = 0.826) compared to total-drug maximum plasma concentration of drug-to-mic ratio (cmax/mic ratio; r(2) = 0.715) and percent time that the total-drug plasma drug concentration remains above the mic (%time>mic; r(2) = 0.749). the magnitudes of the total-drug auc/mic ratios associated with net bacterial stasis, a 1-log(10) cfu reduction from baseline and near maximal effect, were 21.1, 37.2, and 51.8, respectively. pk-pd targets based on such data represent useful inputs for analyses to support dose selection decisions for clinical studies of patients.

TI  == [antimicrobial activity and frequency of spontaneous gentamicin-resistant mutants in bacteria related skin infections].
AB  == gentamicin is used in an ointment form for the treatment of skin infections. to investigate the effect of gentamicin used as an ointment, the antimicrobial susceptibilities against staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococcus pyogenes, and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from community and medical settings were studied and compared with other antibacterial agents such as fradiomycin, chloramphenicol, and bacitracin used as active ingredient for each ointment. gentamicin showed antibacterial activities for all standard bacteria tested, but fradiomycin and chloramphenicol showed no such activities for st. pyogenes and p. aeruginosa, respectively. bacitracin showed activity for  st. pyogenes only. the strains of staphylococci isolated from healthy people were highly susceptible to gentamicin, while 49.3% of the isolates from the patients with skin infections were resistant to gentamicin and 96.4% of the gentamicin-resistant staphylococci carried the aminoglycoside-resistance gene aaca-aphd. the growths of all strains tested, except for two strains of p. aeruginosa, were inhibited by close below 128 microg/ml of gentamicin. furthermore, the frequencies of spontaneous mutants resistant to gentamicin, fradiomycin, and chloramphenicol were each investigated using s. aureus, s. epidermidis, st. pyogenes, and p. aeruginosa. at doses of more than 32 microg/ml  of gentamicin, no resistant mutants in any of bacteria strains tested were obtained. the concentration of gentamicin on the skin was calculated at approximately 895 microg/ml at least when the commercially used 0.1% gentamicin ointment was applied to the skin. therefore, our study strongly indicates that the gentamicin ointment used has a potency of sufficiently inhibiting the growth  of bacteria, including gentamicin-resistant strains, which cause skin infections  in the community.

AB  == the bacterial skin and soft-tissue infections occur commonly and are characterized by more or less intensified changes within skin and subcutaneous tissue. the bacterial skin infections give rise to significant therapeutic problems associated with increasing resistance etiological agents of these infections to antibiotics and chemotherapeutics. the aim of this study was to assess the distribution of various gram-positive microorganisms in skin lesion observed in ambulatory patients in a period from june 2005 to december 2006. there were 116 bacterial strains isolated and identified from clinical samples: staphylococcus aureus, coagulase - negative staphylococi (s.epidermidis, s. xylosus, s.capitis, s.saccharolyticus), propionobacterium acnes, streptococcus spp. (s.agalactiae, s.pyogenes) i corynebacterium spp. (c. striatum, c. amycolatum, c. aquaticum). in the further part of this study we analyzed a profile of their susceptibility to antibiotics and chemotherapeutics in relation  to drugs recommended for the empirical therapy. the resultant resistance patterns among the examined bacterial isolates are indicative of certain divergence between recommended empirical antibiotic therapy and actual antimicrobial susceptibility of many etiologic factors of skin and soft-tissue infections.

TI  == establishment of the first international repository for transfusion-relevant bacteria reference strains: isbt working party transfusion-transmitted infectious diseases (wp-ttid), subgroup on bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates (pcs) still remains  a significant problem in transfusion with potential important clinical consequences, including death. the international society of blood transfusion working party on transfusion-transmitted infectious diseases, subgroup on bacteria, organised an international study on transfusion-relevant bacteria references to be used as a tool for development, validation and comparison of both bacterial screening and pathogen reduction methods. material and methods: four bacteria references (staphylococcus epidermidis pei-b-06, streptococcus pyogenes pei-b-20, klebsiella pneumoniae pei-b-08 and escherichia coli pei-b-19)  were selected regarding their ability to proliferate to high counts in pcs and distributed anonymised to 14 laboratories in 10 countries for identification, enumeration and bacterial proliferation in pcs after low spiking (0.3 and 0.03 cfu/ml), to simulate contamination occurring during blood donation. results: bacteria references were correctly identified in 98% of all 52 identifications. s. pyogenes and e. coli grew in pcs in 11 out of 12 laboratories, and k. pneumoniae and s. epidermidis replicated in all participating laboratories. the results of bacterial counts were very consistent between laboratories: the 95% confidence intervals were for s. epidermidis: 1.19-1.32 x 10(7) cfu/ml, s. pyogenes: 0.58-0.69 x 10(7) cfu/ml, k. pneumoniae: 18.71-20.26 x 10(7) cfu/ml and e. coli: 1.78-2.10 x 10(7) cfu/ml. conclusion: the study was undertaken as a proof of principle with the aim to demonstrate (i) the quality, stability and suitability of the bacterial strains for low-titre spiking of blood components, (ii) the property of donor-independent proliferation in pcs, and (iii) their suitability for worldwide shipping of deep frozen, blinded pathogenic bacteria. these aims were successfully fulfilled. the who expert committee biological standardisation has approved the adoption of these four bacteria strains as the first repository for transfusion-relevant bacteria reference strains and, additionally, endorsed as a project the addition of six further bacteria strain preparations suitable for control of platelet contamination as the next step of enlargement of the repository.

TI  == foam sclerotherapy: investigating the need for sterile air.
AB  == background: sclerotherapy with foam is becoming increasingly popular for the treatment of varicose veins. there is no consensus on the necessity of sterile air or other gases to produce foam. objectives: to evaluate the potential risk of bacterial inoculation of polidocanol (pol) foam using room air and the antimicrobial properties of polidocanol. materials and methods: the amount of airborne microorganisms was quantitatively measured. four bacterial strains were  tested for susceptibility to polidocanol: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and streptococcus pyogenes. results: air measurements varied as a result of air movement and the number of people in the room. although the risk of introducing one colony-formin unit can be calculated as less than 1 in 330, the clinical relevance is still to be determined. no inhibition of bacterial growth was achieved with pol in of any of the tested strains. conclusions: foam sclerotherapy with pol prepared in a standard treatment room is a safe procedure without the risk of introducing a severe bacterial complication. the use of sterile air, nitrogen, or carbon dioxide is unnecessary and will make foam sclerotherapy with pol more elaborate and more expensive to use.

TI  == antibacterial activity in spices and local medicinal plants against clinical isolates of karachi, pakistan.
AB  == context: development of resistance in human pathogens against conventional antibiotic necessitates searching indigenous medicinal plants having antibacterial property. twenty-seven medicinal plants used actively in folklore,  ayurvedic and traditional system of medicine were selected for the evaluation of  their antimicrobial activity for this study. eleven plants chosen from these 27 are used as spices in local cuisine. objective: evaluation of the effectiveness of some medicinal plant extracts against clinical isolates. material and methods: nonedible plant parts were extracted with methanol and evaporated in vacuo to obtain residue. powdered edible parts were boiled three times and cooled in sterile distilled water for 2 min each and filtrate collected. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of plant extracts and filtrates/antibiotics was evaluated against clinical isolates by microbroth dilution method. results: water extract of syzygium aromaticum l. (myrtaceae) buds, methanol extracts of ficus carica l. (moraceae) and olea europaea l. (oleaceae) leaves and peganum harmala l. (nitrariaceae) seeds had mic ranges of 31.25-250 microg/ml. s. aromaticum inhibited growth of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, salmonella enterica serovar typhi and pseudomonas aeruginosa. f. carica and o. europaea inhibited growth of s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and s. pyogenes whereas p. harmala was effective against s. aureus,  acinetobacter calcoaceticus and candida albicans. ampicillin, velosef, sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline and ceftazidime, cefotaxime, cefepime, which are used as control, had mic >/= 50 and 1.5 microg/ml, respectively, for organisms sensitive to extracts. discussion and conclusion: mono/multiextract from identified plants will provide an array of safe antimicrobial agents to control infections by drug-resistant bacteria.

TI  == chitosan augments photodynamic inactivation of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation (pdi) was shown to be a promising treatment modality for microbial infections. this study explores the effect of chitosan, a polycationic biopolymer, in increasing the pdi efficacy against gram-positive bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa),  as well as the gram-negative bacteria pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii. chitosan at <0.1% was included in the antibacterial process either by  coincubation with hematoporphyrin (hp) and subjection to light exposure to induce the pdi effect or by addition after pdi and further incubation for 30 min. under  conditions in which hp-pdi killed the microbe on a 2- to 4-log scale, treatment with chitosan at concentrations of as low as 0.025% for a further 30 min completely eradicated the bacteria (which were originally at approximately 10(8)  cfu/ml). similar results were also found with toluidine blue o (tbo)-mediated pdi in planktonic and biofilm cells. however, without pdi treatment, chitosan alone did not exert significant antimicrobial activity with 30 min of incubation, suggesting that the potentiated effect of chitosan worked after the bacterial damage induced by pdi. further studies indicated that the potentiated pdi effect  of chitosan was related to the level of pdi damage and the deacetylation level of the chitosan. these results indicate that the combination of pdi and chitosan is  quite promising for eradicating microbial infections.

TI  == ozone in dentistry: microbiological effects of gas action depending on the method and the time of application using the ozonytron device. experimental study.
AB  == introduction: bactericidal, virucidal, and fungicidal activity of ozone is generally known and has been exploited for years in industry and medicine. ozone  therapy became an inherent element of the treatment of infection in such fields as surgery, dermatology, cosmetics, and dentistry. ozone is a gas, so it penetrates very well even into such tissues and spaces that are not easily accessible. thanks to the property of deep penetration and long ozone presence in tissues after treatment, a long-lasting bactericidal effect is achieved. the action of oxygen radicals is, however, not neutral for the human organism, therefore the use of an appropriate procedure and therapy algorithms is essential. material and methods: we decided to confirm the effect of antibacterial activity of ozone applied by means of the ozonytron device (made by biozonix) on model strains of streptococcus salivarius, pneumonia, pyogenes, and  agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, using two application patterns developed by us. results: we found a statistically significant difference in the size of zones of inhibited bacterial growth on all  media depending on the time of action of ozone. in the present paper, the bactericidal activity of ozone in relation to bacterial strains that are most frequently isolated from the oral cavity was confirmed. what is more, two models  of application of the gas on the infected medium were compared. conclusion: research on the use of ozone in combatting bacteria typical for dental diseases has shown that the gas has an oxidizing effect on these bacteria and is bactericidal.

TI  == bactericidal effects of non-thermal argon plasma in vitro, in biofilms and in the animal model of infected wounds.
AB  == non-thermal (low-temperature) physical plasma is under intensive study as an alternative approach to control superficial wound and skin infections when the effectiveness of chemical agents is weak due to natural pathogen or biofilm resistance. the purpose of this study was to test the individual susceptibility of pathogenic bacteria to non-thermal argon plasma and to measure the effectiveness of plasma treatments against bacteria in biofilms and on wound surfaces. overall, gram-negative bacteria were more susceptible to plasma treatment than gram-positive bacteria. for the gram-negative bacteria pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cenocepacia and escherichia coli, there were no survivors among the initial 10(5) c.f.u. after a 5 min plasma treatment. the susceptibility of gram-positive bacteria was species- and strain-specific. streptococcus pyogenes was the most resistant with 17 % survival of the initial 10(5) c.f.u. after a 5 min plasma treatment. staphylococcus aureus had a strain-dependent resistance with 0 and 10 % survival from 10(5) c.f.u. of the sa  78 and atcc 6538 strains, respectively. staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecium had medium resistance. non-ionized argon gas was not bactericidal. biofilms partly protected bacteria, with the efficiency of protection dependent on biofilm thickness. bacteria in deeper biofilm layers survived better after the plasma treatment. a rat model of a superficial slash wound infected with p. aeruginosa and the plasma-sensitive staphylococcus aureus  strain sa 78 was used to assess the efficiency of argon plasma treatment. a 10 min treatment significantly reduced bacterial loads on the wound surface. a 5-day course of daily plasma treatments eliminated p. aeruginosa from the plasma-treated animals 2 days earlier than from the control ones. a statistically significant increase in the rate of wound closure was observed in plasma-treated  animals after the third day of the course. wound healing in plasma-treated animals slowed down after the course had been completed. overall, the results show considerable potential for non-thermal argon plasma in eliminating pathogenic bacteria from biofilms and wound surfaces.

TI  == mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  == the oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. when this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. the mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the streptococcus (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis) and staphylococcus (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis. in addition, some members of both the streptococcus and the staphylococcus genera, as well as porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. the current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. the pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of topical skin pharmaceuticals - an in vitro study.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial activity of currently  available topical skin pharmaceuticals against candida albicans, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus pyogenes. the agar dilution assay was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration for cream formulations and their active substances. corticosteroid  formulations with the antiseptics clioquinol or halquinol were active against all microbes. the hydrogen peroxide formulation was primarily active against staphylococci. clotrimazole, miconazole and econazole showed an effect against staphylococci in addition to their effect on c. albicans. in contrast, terbinafine had no antibacterial effect. fusidic acid was active against staphylococci, with slightly weaker activity against s. pyogenes and no activity  against c. albicans or e. coli. in summary, some topical skin pharmaceuticals have broad antimicrobial activity in vitro, clioquinol and halquinol being the most diverse. in limited superficial skin infection topical treatment can be an alternative to systemic antibiotics and should be considered. with the global threat of multi-resistant bacteria there is a need for new, topical, non-resistance-promoting, antimicrobial preparations for the treatment of skin infections.

TI  == activation of tlr2 by a small molecule produced by staphylococcus epidermidis increases antimicrobial defense against bacterial skin infections.
AB  == production of antimicrobial peptides by epithelia is an essential defense against infectious pathogens. in this study we evaluated whether the commensal microorganism staphylococcus epidermidis may enhance production of antimicrobial  peptides by keratinocytes and thus augment skin defense against infection. exposure of cultured undifferentiated human keratinocytes to a sterile nontoxic small molecule of <10 kda from s. epidermidis conditioned culture medium (secm),  but not similar preparations from other bacteria, enhanced human beta-defensin 2  (hbd2) and hbd3 mrna expression and increased the capacity of cell lysates to inhibit the growth of group a streptococcus (gas) and s. aureus. partial gene silencing of hbd3 inhibited this antimicrobial action. this effect was relevant in vivo as administration of secm to mice decreased susceptibility to infection by gas. toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2) was important to this process as a tlr2-neutralizing antibody blocked induction of hbds 2 and 3, and tlr2-deficient  mice did not show induction of mbd4. taken together, these findings reveal a potential use for normal commensal bacterium s. epidermidis to activate tlr2 signaling and induce antimicrobial peptide expression, thus enabling the skin to  mount an enhanced response to pathogens.

TI  == cem-101 activity against gram-positive organisms.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cem-101, a new fluoroketolide, was determined against gram-positive organisms with various macrolide susceptibility profiles. experiments for determination of the mics and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs), timed killing, single-step and multistep mutation rates, the erythromycin induction of resistance, postantibiotic effect (pae), and drug interactions were  performed for cem-101; and the results were compared to those obtained with telithromycin, macrolides, and lincosamides. the mbcs of cem-101 remained lower overall than those of telithromycin, and cem-101 displayed a 2-fold greater potency than the ketolide. timed-killing curve testing showed that cem-101 had greater bactericidal activity than telithromycin (a >or=3-log(10)-cfu/ml decrease in the initial inoculum at 24 h) against the staphylococcal isolates tested. the  propensity of cem-101 to cause resistance was low, as determined from the rates of resistance determined in single-step mutational studies (<10(-8) or 10(-9)). in multipassaging studies, mutants of two strains (both of which were usa300 isolates) resistant to cem-101 emerged. that number was comparable to the number  resistant to clindamycin but less than the number resistant to telithromycin. erythromycin induced cem-101 resistance in staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae, similar to telithromycin; however, in seven of eight beta-hemolytic streptococci, cem-101 resistance induction was not observed. cem-101 showed a significant concentration- and exposure-dependent pae against the strains tested, with the values ranging from 2.3 to 6.1 h for gram-positive organisms (these times were longer than those for telithromycin). no antagonism was found in synergy analyses, with enhanced inhibition being most noted for combinations with cem-101 and ceftriaxone, gentamicin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. overall, this new antimicrobial agent (cem-101) showed good antimicrobial characteristics compared with those of the agents in its class and exhibited measured parameter values similar or superior to those of utilized comparators, indicating that cem-101 warrants further clinical evaluation.

TI  == staphylococcus epidermidis antimicrobial delta-toxin (phenol-soluble modulin-gamma) cooperates with host antimicrobial peptides to kill group a streptococcus.
AB  == antimicrobial peptides play an important role in host defense against pathogens.  recently, phenol-soluble modulins (psms) from staphylococcus epidermidis (s. epidermidis) were shown to interact with lipid membranes, form complexes, and exert antimicrobial activity. based on the abundance and innocuity of the cutaneous resident s. epidermidis, we hypothesized that their psms contribute to  host defense. here we show that s. epidermidis delta-toxin (psmgamma) is normally present in the epidermis and sparsely in the dermis of human skin using immunohistochemistry. synthetic delta-toxin interacted with neutrophil extracellular traps (nets) and colocalized with cathelicidin while also inducing  net formation in human neutrophils. in antimicrobial assays against group a streptococcus (gas), delta-toxin cooperated with cramp, hbd2, and hbd3. in whole  blood, addition of delta-toxin exerted a bacteriostatic effect on gas, and in nets, delta-toxin increased their killing capacity against this pathogen. coimmunoprecipitation and tryptophan spectroscopy demonstrated direct binding of  delta-toxin to host antimicrobial peptides ll-37, cramp, hbd2, and hbd3. finally, in a mouse wound model, gas survival was reduced (along with mip-2 cytokine levels) when the wounds were pretreated with delta-toxin. thus, these data suggest that s. epidermidis-derived delta-toxin cooperates with the host-derived  antimicrobial peptides in the innate immune system to reduce survival of an important human bacterial pathogen.

TI  == [etiology, resistance and diagnostic techniques in skin and skin structure infections].
AB  == skin and soft tissue infections (ssti) are common and, generally, uncomplicated at the time of initial presentation. however, these infections can worsen quickly when there are delays in diagnosis and treatment. the clinical presentation of most ssti is the culmination of a microbial three-step process as follow: i) bacterial adherence to host cells; ii) invasion of tissue with evasion of host defences, and iii) elaboration of toxins. even if the microbiology of wounds has  been actively investigated in recent years, there is still much to be learned about the microbial mechanisms that induce infection and prevent wound healing. there are also several means by which bacteria penetrate the skin barrier. the most common route is through a break in the barrier (lacerations, bite wounds, scratches, instrumentations, pre-existing skin conditions, wounds or ulcers, burns and surgery); other routes of penetration include contiguous spread from adjacent infections (e.g. osteomyelitis), entry of water into the skin pores, and, rarely, haematogenous seeding (i.e septic emboli). from what it was said, many microorganisms, above all from the normal skin microbiota, can be involved in these often polymicrobial infections, with gram-positives such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus epidermidis, corynebacterium spp being predominant. many other aerobic and anaerobic species,  including gram-negative bacilli, can also be involved. even if the diagnosis of most ssti is based on clinical examination, laboratory investigations, guided by  clinical information, can help to confirm the diagnosis and elucidate the characteristics of specific pathogens. these microbiological investigations may include blood cultures, tissue swabs with culture, and needle aspiration. in rapidly progressing infections, empirical therapy is essential, although microbiological data are important in confirming subsequently that the chosen regimen is appropriate. furthermore, the number of microorganisms becoming resistant to many usual drugs and the changing microbial epidemiology of these infections, such as the emergence of ca-mrsa, required a constant cooperation between the microbiology lab and the clinician in order to address microbiological aspects that can be critical to the successful management of ssti.

TI  == selective antimicrobial action is provided by phenol-soluble modulins derived from staphylococcus epidermidis, a normal resident of the skin.
AB  == antimicrobial peptides serve as a first line of innate immune defense against invading organisms such as bacteria and viruses. in this study, we hypothesized that peptides produced by a normal microbial resident of human skin, staphylococcus epidermidis, might also act as an antimicrobial shield and contribute to normal defense at the epidermal interface. we show by circular dichroism and tryptophan spectroscopy that phenol-soluble modulins (psms) gamma and delta produced by s. epidermidis have an alpha-helical character and a strong lipid membrane interaction similar to mammalian amps such as ll-37. both psms directly induced lipid vesicle leakage and exerted selective antimicrobial action against skin pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus. psms functionally cooperated with each other and ll-37 to enhance antimicrobial action. moreover, psms reduced group a streptococcus (gas) but not the survival of s. epidermidis on mouse skin. thus, these data suggest that the production of psmgamma and psmdelta by s. epidermidis can benefit cutaneous immune defense by selectively inhibiting the survival of skin pathogens while maintaining the normal skin microbiome.

TI  == improved photodynamic inactivation of gram-positive bacteria using hematoporphyrin encapsulated in liposomes and micelles.
AB  == background and objectives: antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation (pdi) is a promising treatment modality for local infections. to increase the efficacy of photosensitizer, hematoporphyrin (hp) was used as a model drug and encapsulated in liposomes and micelles. the bactericidal efficacy of the carrier-entrapped hp  was assessed against gram-positive bacteria. study design/materials and methods:  hp was encapsulated in liposomes by a modified reversed-phase evaporation and extrusion method. micelle-hp was prepared by the reversed-phase evaporation method. spectroscopic analysis was used to characterize the properties of hp in pbs, liposome or micelle. the pdi efficacy was examined by using gram-positive pathogens including methicillin-susceptible, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pyogenes. results: the absorption and fluorescence emission spectra indicated that hp encapsulated in liposomes and micelles is less likely to exist in aggregated form compared to that generally seen in an aqueous medium. liposome- or micelle-hp can induce complete eradication of the bacteria above a critical hp dose, which is significantly lower than the dose required when using the non-encapsulated hp. furthermore, the pdi effect of the hp encapsulated in micelles was superior to the hp encapsulated in liposomes at lower hp doses. similar pdi results were also found in s. epidermidis and s. pyogenes. conclusions: our results indicate that photosensitizer entrapped in micelle exert similar or better pdi efficacy than that of liposome, which indicates this formulation may be useful for the treatment of local infections in the future.

TI  == rhodomyrtone: a new candidate as natural antibacterial drug from rhodomyrtus tomentosa.
AB  == rhodomyrtone [6,8-dihydroxy-2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-7-(3-methyl-1-oxobutyl)-9-(2-methylpropyl)-4,9 -dihydro-1h-xanthene-1,3(2h)-di-one] from rhodomyrtus tomentosa (aiton) hassk. displayed significant antibacterial activities against gram-positive bacteria including bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus salivarius. especially noteworthy was the activity against mrsa with a minimum inhibitory concentration  (mic) and a minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) ranging from 0.39 to 0.78 microg/ml. as shown for s. pyogenes, no surviving cells were detected within 5 and 6h after treatment with the compound at 8mbc and 4mbc concentrations, respectively. rhodomyrtone displays no bacteriolytic activity, as determined by measurement of the optical density at 620 nm. a rhodomyrtone killing test with s. mutans using phase contrast microscopy showed that this compound caused a few morphological changes as the treated cells were slightly changed in color and bigger than the control when they were killed. taken together, the results support the view that rhodomyrtone has a strong bactericidal activity on gram-positive bacteria, including major pathogens.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of some thiourea derivatives and their nickel and copper complexes.
AB  == five thiourea derivative ligands and their ni(2+) and cu(2+) complexes have been  synthesized. the compounds were screened for their in vitro anti-bacterial activity using gram-positive bacteria (two different standard strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus cereus) and gram-negative bacteria (esherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, proteus vulgaris, enterobacter aerogenes) and in vitro anti-yeast activity (candida albicans, candida krusei, candida glabrata, candida tropicalis, candida parapsilosis). the  minimum inhibitory concentration was determined for all ligands and their complexes. in vitro anti-yeast activity of both ligands and their metal complexes is greater than their in vitro anti-bacterial activity. the effect of the structure of the investigated compounds on the antimicrobial activity is discussed.

TI  == enumeration of mycobacterium leprae using real-time pcr.
AB  == mycobacterium leprae is not cultivable in axenic media, and direct microscopic enumeration of the bacilli is complex, labor intensive, and suffers from limited  sensitivity and specificity. we have developed a real-time pcr assay for quantifying m. leprae dna in biological samples. primers were identified to amplify a shared region of the multicopy repeat sequence (rlep) specific to m. leprae and tested for sensitivity and specificity in the taqman format. the assay was specific for m. leprae and able to detect 10 fg of purified m. leprae dna, or approximately 300 bacteria in infected tissues. we used the rlep taqman pcr to assess the short and long-term growth results of m. leprae in foot pad tissues obtained from conventional mice, a gene knock-out mouse strain, athymic nude mice, as well as from reticuloendothelial tissues of m. leprae-infected nine-banded armadillos. we found excellent correlative results between estimates  from rlep taqman pcr and direct microscopic counting (combined r = 0.98). the rlep taqman pcr permitted rapid analysis of batch samples with high reproducibility and is especially valuable for detection of low numbers of bacilli. molecular enumeration is a rapid, objective and highly reproducible means to estimate the numbers of m. leprae in tissues, and application of the technique can facilitate work with this agent in many laboratories.

TI  == antibacterial properties of synovial fluid in the knee.
AB  == this study evaluated antimicrobial properties of synovial fluid against 3 gram-positive organisms: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus epidermidis. synovial fluid was collected from the knees of 52 patients. three gram-positive bacteria culture lines were incubated in wells containing either synovial fluid and broth, or broth alone. fluid was plated and  incubated, and colonies were counted after 1, 4, and 24 hours to determine bacterial growth. statistically significant differences in bacterial counts were  found between control and experimental groups at 0, 4, and 24 hours for all 3 bacterial species. bacterial counts in the control specimens demonstrated exponential growth over 24 hours as would be expected in the absence of growth inhibition. in contrast, bacterial counts in all of the synovial fluid specimens  decreased steadily over 24 hours. these results demonstrate synovial fluid possesses potent bactericidal activity against the most common gram-positive pathogens responsible for septic arthritis. delineating these antimicrobial properties further may offer avenues to augment the body's protection against bacterial infections.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial effects of topical local anesthetics.
AB  == background: the antibacterial activities of local anesthetics are recognized. objective: to investigate in vitro the activity of topical local anesthetic ointments at clinical doses. methods: the activity of two different local anesthetic ointments including lidocaine 5% and lidocaine/prilocaine 2.5% was tested against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis by the disc-diffusion method. sterile discs containing topical local anesthetic drugs were prepared taking into account the doses of ointments used in clinical practice. the validity of the methodology was confirmed using topical antibacterial mupirocin. the inhibition zones of the discs were measured. results: mupirocin inhibited all the bacteria. both local anesthetic ointments were found to be most effective on e. coli, whereas they had no effects on p. aeruginosa. lidocaine 5% revealed antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, e. coli, s. pyogenes and e. faecalis, but lidocaine/prilocaine 2.5%  showed no activity on e. faecalis and inhibited s. pyogenes only at double doses. it was also observed that the antibacterial activity was in a dose-dependent manner. conclusion: in the light of these findings, it might be concluded that topical local anesthetic ointments in routine settings may have a preventive role against some bacteria.

TI  == [the assessment of bacterial flora and antibiotic-sensitivity of bacteria isolated from conjunctival sac, skin of the eyelids and inflammatory lesions in patients with acne vulgaris and rosacea].
AB  == aim: to evaluate bacterial flora of conjunctival sac, the skin of the eyelids and inflammatory lesions in patients with acne vulgaris, rosacea and of healthy people. bacterial colonization of conjunctival sac, the skin of the eyelids and skin lesions is more frequent in patients with acne vulgaris and rosacea. because antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria are quite often met, it seems important  to determine antibiotic-sensitivity of isolated bacteria. material and methods: 178 people underwent bacteriological examination of conjunctival sac, skin of the eyelids and skin lesions: 64 patients with acne vulgaris, 59 patients with rosacea and 55 healthy persons. microorganisms were identified with laboratory techniques with the use of bio-merieux kits and determination of drug-sensitivity was performed with recognized laboratory techniques. results: positive cultures and general frequencies of the isolations were found to be higher in both groups  in comparison with the reference group (the group of clinically healthy people).  in healthy persons practically the only saprophytic bacteria--the most often s. epidermidis and s. viridans--were isolated. whereas in patients suffering from acne vulgaris and rosacea the pathogenic bacteria--s. aureus, p. fluorescens, p.  acnes, p. aeruginosa--were additionally isolated. different spectrum of sensitivity to antibiotics of bacteria isolated from conjunctival sac, the skin of the eyelids and skin lesions in the cases of acne vulgaris and rosacea was proved. conclusions: 1. in the cases of acne vulgaris the majority of isolated bacteria from conjunctival sac included streptococcus spp., staphylococcus spp. and enterobacteriaceae. 2. in the severe cases of rosacea the main bacteria found in conjunctival sac were s. aureus, s.pyogenes, p.aeruginosa, e. faecalis, a. baumanii, p. fluorescens. 3. because of changeable drug-sensitivity of bacterial  strains, it seems to be necessary to perform individual culture and antibiogram in every patient with inflammatory lesions, in particular in clinically severe and resistant to therapy cases of acne vulgaris and rosacea. 4. the higher frequency of the bacterial colonisations in the conjunctival sac in patients with acne vulgaris and rosacea can be a potential source of ocular infections in the cases of local and systemic disorders of protective mechanisms. 5. estimation of  bacterial flora and antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from conjunctival sac, the skin of the eyelids and skin lesions should be perform, especially when  patients are prepared for eye surgery.

TI  == in vitro investigation of the antibacterial effect of ketamine.
AB  == background: antibacterial activity of local anesthetics especially lidocaine has  been shown previously. in this study, the antibacterial effect of ketamine, a general anesthetic agent was investigated. methods: the antibacterial effect of ketamine was studied using six different strains of bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, entecoccus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes,  pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli) with disc diffusion method. ciprofloxacine discs (cip, oxoid) were used as a control to verify the methodology. minimal inhibition concentration (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) of ketamine for these bacteria were also determined. results: no inhibition was evident in discs containing 62.5 microg of ketamine. ketamine 125 microg showed activity on all the bacteria tested with the exception of e. coli. the inhibition rates of ketamine were more prominent at the doses of 250 microg and 500 microg similar to the inhibition rate of cip. whereas mic and mbc  values of ketamine for s. aureus and s. pyogenes were 500 microg ml(-1), mic and  mbc values for p. aeruginosa were above 2000 microg ml(-1). for other bacteria, these values ranged between these levels. conclusions: ketamine with higher doses showed antibacterial activity. we thought that it will be proper to use ketamine  hesitantly in experimental animal studies like sepsis and translocation.

TI  == a quantitative approach to the effectiveness of ozone against microbiota organisms colonizing toothbrushes.
AB  == objectives: toothbrushes are rapidly contaminated with different microorganisms,  which colonize the oral cavity and interdental spaces. this can represent a possible cause of infection or reinfection. in this study, the ozone experimental effect upon toothbrushes microflora was estimated microbiologically before and after saturation with ozone gas. methods: fifty used toothbrushes coming from children and adults were entered our study. microorganisms were enumerated and identified. bristles from each brush were soaked in ozone saturated pbs solution  for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min and the total microbial population was reassessed. results: counts of microorganisms isolated per brush varied between 10(2) and 10(7) cfu. candida albicans was present in used toothbrushes. no obligate anaerobes were isolated. members of streptococcaceae family were regularly found  (65.2%) belonging to the following species: streptococcus pyogenes, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. sobrinus, s. viridans, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, aerococcus viridans. a. viridans and s. mutans were more frequently isolated on children toothbrushes while staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis were found on adults  brushes. escherichia coli, pseudomonas sp. and enterococcus sp., were also recovered. we found that the ozone treatment decreased gradually the microbial load. however, a bacterial re-growth was effective following short ozonation period. decontamination was complete after an extended exposure to ozone for 30 min. conclusions: ozone application was found to remove the toothbrushes bristles microbiota following conventional brushing. maximum decontamination efficacy of ozone treatment was observed after 30 min while exposure for short time periods seems to be inefficient which probably reflect the low dose of ozone used in this study.

TI  == frequency and expression of mutacin biosynthesis genes in isolates of streptococcus mutans with different mutacin-producing phenotypes.
AB  == the aim of this study was to analyse the frequency and expression of biosynthesis genes in 47 streptococcus mutans isolates with different mutacin-producing phenotypes. detection of the frequency and expression of genes encoding mutacin types i, ii, iii and iv were carried out by pcr and semi-quantitative rt-pcr, respectively, using primers specific for each type of biosynthesis gene. in addition, a further eight genes encoding putative bacteriocins, designated bsm 283, bsm 299, bsm 423, bsm 1889c, bsm 1892c, bsm 1896, bsm 1906c and bsm 1914, were also screened. there was a high phenotypic diversity; some streptococcus mutans isolates presented broad antimicrobial spectra against other streptococcus mutans clinical isolates, including bacteria resistant to common antibiotics, as  well as staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis  and streptococcus pyogenes. the expression frequency of the bsm gene was higher than that of the previously characterized mutacins (i-iv). there was no positive  correlation between the number of indicator strains inhibited (antimicrobial spectra) and the number of biosynthesis genes expressed (spearman correlation test, r=-0.03, p>0.05). in conclusion, the high diversity of mutacin-producing phenotypes, associated with high frequency of expression of the biosynthesis genes screened, reveals a broad repertoire of genetic determinants encoding antimicrobial peptides that can act in different combinations.

TI  == necrotizing fasciitis in children: diagnostic and therapeutic aspects.
AB  == background: necrotizing fasciitis (nf) is a severe life-threatening soft tissue infection characterized by rapidly spreading necrosis of the fascia and the subcutaneous tissue. its incidence owing to invasive streptococcus pyogenes has significantly increased in children recently. our experience with nf in children  to describe diagnostic and therapeutic aspects is hence presented herein. methods: records of children who were treated for nf in our unit from 1999 to 2006, inclusive, were reviewed retrospectively. information recorded for each patient included medical history, clinical characteristics, diagnostic procedures, treatment methods, and the outcome. results: thirteen patients with a mean age of 35 months were treated for nf during the study period. all of the 13  children had no previous immunosuppression. the predisposing factors were composed of varicella lesions, intramuscular injections, application of a cream containing menthol to the cervical region, penetrant gluteal trauma, omphalitis,  dental abscess, and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. the most common site of the initial involvement was the abdominal wall, followed by the gluteal region and thigh, head and neck, and upper and lower extremities. the initial skin presentations were induration or cellulitis and erythema and edema with progression to skin discoloration and bullae formation. fever and tachycardia were the most common clinical features. s. pyogenes was the most common causative microorganism, followed by staphylococcus epidermidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. all patients underwent extensive surgical debridement and received appropriate antibiotics and supportive therapy. twelve patients survived, and 1 patient with  delayed diagnosis of nf died of septic shock. conclusion: although these infections are rare in children, their lethal potential and early diagnostic signs must be recognized. all children with nf should undergo early surgical debridement to prevent delay in treatment. the mortality and morbidity associated with nf in children can be decreased with clinical awareness, early diagnosis, and adequate and urgent surgical debridement followed by intensive supportive care and early wound resurfacing.

TI  == inherent antibacterial activity of a peptide-based beta-hairpin hydrogel.
AB  == among several important considerations for implantation of a biomaterial, a main  concern is the introduction of infection. we have designed a hydrogel scaffold from the self-assembling peptide, max1, for tissue regeneration applications whose surface exhibits inherent antibacterial activity. in experiments where max1 gels are challenged with bacterial solutions ranging in concentrations from 2 x 10(3) colony forming units (cfus)/dm2 to 2 x 10(9) cfus/dm2, gel surfaces exhibit broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. results show that the hydrogel surface is  active against gram-positive (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus,  and streptococcus pyogenes) and gram-negative (klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli) bacteria, all prevalent in hospital settings. live-dead assays  employing laser scanning confocal microscopy show that bacteria are killed when they engage the surface. in addition, the surface of max1 hydrogels was shown to  cause inner and outer membrane disruption in experiments that monitor the release of beta-galactosidase from the cytoplasm of lactose permease-deficient e. coli ml-35. these data suggest a mechanism of antibacterial action that involves membrane disruption that leads to cell death upon cellular contact with the gel surface. although the hydrogel surface exhibits bactericidal activity, co-culture experiments indicate hydrogel surfaces show selective toxicity to bacterial versus mammalian cells. additionally, gel surfaces are nonhemolytic toward human  erythrocytes, which maintain healthy morphologies when in contact with the surface. these material attributes make max1 gels attractive candidates for use in tissue regeneration, even in nonsterile environments.

TI  == evaluation of the in vitro activity of tigecycline against multiresistant gram-positive cocci containing tetracycline resistance determinants.
AB  == this study was undertaken to test the in vitro activity of tigecycline against 117 clinically relevant gram-positive pathogens and to correlate this activity with their resistance gene content. overall, tigecycline showed a minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) range of 0.015-0.5mg/l, able to inhibit potently all multiresistant streptococci, enterococci and mr staphylococci. tigecycline was active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and enterococci, with mics for 90% of the organisms (mic(90)) of 0.25 mg/l and 0.12 mg/l, respectively, being more active than linezolid (mic(90)=2 mg/l) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (mic(90)=0.5 and 2-4 mg/l, respectively). molecular characterisation of resistance determinants demonstrated the concomitant presence of different classes of genes: in particular, tet(m), erm(b) and erm(c) in streptococcus agalactiae; tet(o), variably associated with different erm genes, in streptococcus pyogenes; vana, tet(m) and erm(b) in enterococcus faecalis, and  vana and erm(b) in enterococcus faecium. all the mrsa strains harboured sccmec and erm genes and 50% possessed tet(k) with tet(m) genes. staphylococcus epidermidis strains were only resistant to erythromycin. these results clearly demonstrate that tigecycline has a mic(90) range of 0.015-0.5 mg/l both against tetracycline-susceptible and -resistant isolates carrying other resistance determinants, suggesting that this drug could play an important role in the treatment of infections caused by these multiresistant gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == albomycin is an effective antibiotic, as exemplified with yersinia enterocolitica and streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == albomycin belongs to the class of sideromycins, compounds composed of iron carriers linked to antibiotic moieties. albomycin was found to be active against  bacteria that have a functional ferric hydroxamate transport system meaning that  bacteria will actively transport albomycin until they die. we examined the activity spectrum of albomycin for bacterial pathogens and found that enterobacteriaceae except species of proteus and morganella were sensitive. resistance in the two genera was due to the lack of the ferric hydroxamate transport system. among gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae were highly sensitive, whereas streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus epidermidis were resistant. the in vivo efficacy of albomycin was examined in mice infected with s. pneumoniae or yersinia enterocolitica. a single dose of 10mg albomycin/kg body weight reduced the colony-forming units of y. enterocolitica by three to four orders of magnitude. a single dose of 1mg albomycin/kg body weight was sufficient to clear  s. pneumoniae infections in mice. in direct competition experiments with wild-type s. pneumoniae and its albomycin-resistant mutant, the recovery rate of  the mutant was lower than for the wild-type indicating that the mutant had reduced fitness in the mouse model. we conclude that albomycin is effective in clearing infections caused by both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in a  mouse model. albomycin treatment reduces the bacterial load allowing the immune system to remove residual albomycin-resistant bacteria, and as such would make albomycin-based antibiotics an adjunct to treatment. the ferrichrome transport system serves as a trojan horse to get albomycin into bacteria.

AB  == we have developed a novel high-throughput pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (pcr-ldr-ce) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, francisella tularensis, and brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. the method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16s rrna gene, using universal pcr primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent ldr. the ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by ce. each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to  distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. the assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. the ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the united states. in summary, the pcr-ldr-ce assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of  20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.

AB  == intracellular efflux pumps have been largely the research focus in multidrug-resistant (mdr) gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms and parasites including cancers. however, drug efflux mechanisms other than pumps per se have been observed, supported by the effects of isomeric, non-antibiotic depressant (dpr), phenothiazines and thixenes, and antidepressant (adpr) phenylpiperidine neurotropic drugs, alone or in combination with classical antimicrobials on mdr staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. of the non-antibiotics we investigated, the dpr l-thioridazine, trans-clopenthixol and isomers of phenylpiperidines nnc 20-4962 (isomer of femoxetine) and nnc 20-7052 (isomer of paroxetine) were potent antimicrobials with the least neurotropic activity, pointing to a possible general isomeric structure-activity  relationship. these compounds may be regarded as new efflux inhibitors. moreover, these isomers have considerably reduced, in some cases absent, neurotropism and reduced mammalian toxicity. this may alleviate concerns about adverse effects and therapeutic safety for infected patients in life-threatening situations where the non-antibiotic dosage would be in the lower, non-chronic dosage ranges generally  prescribed for individuals with mild mental health problems. the results point to the prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms' phospholipid/protein domain involvement of the cationic, amphiphilic, non-antibiotic dpr and adpr, with the phospholipids being the initial sites attracting and concentrating the neurotropes to induce a form of suspended animation, followed by gross changes of cell wall and membrane structure, and thereby potentiating their destructive or immobilizing effects on various as yet only hinted at resistance and efflux mechanisms. combination of appropriate isomeric non-antibiotic dpr and adpr of low neurotropism and toxicity with conventional and classical antimicrobials promises early, new therapeutic strategies salutary against microbial resistance, resistance development, pathogenicity and virulence.

TI  == increased blood levels of igg reactive with secreted streptococcus pyogenes proteins in chronic plaque psoriasis.
AB  == a pathogenic role for streptococcus (s) pyogenes infections in chronic plaque psoriasis is suspected but poorly defined. we separated cellular and supernatant  proteins from s. pyogenes cultures by high-resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and used immunoblotting to demonstrate the diversity of serum or plasma iggs that react with elements of the proteome of this bacterium. we have shown that a substantial proportion of igg-reactive proteins from cultured s. pyogenes are secreted. the total secreted protein fraction, including diverse igg-binding elements, was subsequently used in an elisa to measure blood titers of reactive igg. this elisa showed that blood samples from patients with chronic  plaque psoriasis contained significantly higher titers of reactive igg than samples from age- and sex-matched healthy controls (p=0.0009). in contrast, neither a standard assay measuring antistreptolysin o titers nor elisas measuring titers of igg reactive with protein fractions from staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, were able to distinguish between blood samples from the two groups. these findings justify the hypothesis that s. pyogenes infections are more important in the pathogenesis of chronic plaque psoriasis than has previously been recognized, and indicate the need for further controlled therapeutic trials of antibacterial measures in this common skin disease.

TI  == ability of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 to participate in bacterial translocation across the intestinal epithelial barrier.
AB  == although hundreds of microbial species reside in the human intestinal tract, comparatively few (e.g., escherichia coli and other enterobacteria, enterococcus  faecalis, etc.) are typically associated with systemic infection in postsurgical, shock, and trauma patients. syndecan-1 is the predominant cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed on epithelia, and there is substantial evidence that heparan sulfate participates in interactions of a variety of frankly pathogenic microbes with mammalian cells. to investigate the role of syndecan-1 in interactions of enteric flora with intestinal epithelium, bacteria that might  use the enterocyte as a portal of entry for systemic infection (including e. faecalis, e. coli, and other enterobacteria, and several species of staphylococci and streptococci) were studied for their abilities to interact with syndecan-1. streptococcus bovis, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and s. epidermidis showed increased adherence to arh-77 cells transfected to express syndecan-1. heparin, a heparan sulfate analog, inhibited internalization of s. bovis, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, and s. aureus by ht-29 enterocytes (prominent  syndecan-1 expression), but not caco-2 enterocytes (relatively low syndecan-1 expression). data from experiments with chinese hamster ovary cells with altered  glycosaminoglycan expression indicated that heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate (glycosaminoglycans on the syndecan-1 ectodomain) participated in bacterial interactions with mammalian cells. thus, although e. faecalis, e. coli, and other gram-negative enterobacteria did not appear to interact with syndecan-1, this heparan sulfate proteoglycan may mediate enterocyte interactions with some staphylococci and streptococci that are known to cause systemic infections in specific populations of high-risk, immunosuppressed, postsurgical,  and trauma patients.

TI  == antibacterial activity of rep8839, a new antibiotic for topical use.
AB  == rep8839 is a novel methionyl-trna synthetase (mets) inhibitor with potent antibacterial activity against clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and other clinically important gram-positive bacteria but little activity against gram-negative bacteria. all isolates of s. aureus, including strains resistant to methicillin, mupirocin, vancomycin, and linezolid  were susceptible to rep8839 at concentrations of < or =0.5 microg/ml. rep8839 was also active against staphylococcus epidermidis, including multiply resistant strains (mic, < or =0.25 microg/ml). all s. pyogenes isolates were susceptible to rep8839 at concentrations of < or =0.25 microg/ml, suggesting that mets2, a second enzyme previously identified in streptococcus pneumoniae, was not present  in this organism. rep8839 was highly bound to the protein of human serum, and activity was not greatly influenced by inoculum size but was affected by ph, exhibiting optimal antibacterial activity in a neutral medium rather than a weak  acidic medium. like mupirocin, rep8839 exhibited bacteriostatic activity against  key pathogens. the emergence of mupirocin resistance in s. aureus highlights the  need for a new topical antibiotic with the ability to inhibit high-level mupirocin-resistant strains and other emerging phenotypes, such as vancomycin-resistant and community-acquired methicillin-resistant isolates.

TI  == chlorine covers on living bacteria: the initial step in antimicrobial action of active chlorine compounds.
AB  == objectives: although active chlorine compounds are well-known antimicrobial agents in human medicine, their initial steps of action have not been completely  clarified. using n-chlorotaurine (nct), an endogenous mild representative, we observed persisting oxidation capacity affixed to bacteria. it was the aim of this study to investigate this 'chlorine cover'. methods: pathogens were incubated in nct, which was subsequently washed off. the oxidation capacity on the bacterial surface was measured photometrically. results: superficial chlorination in the form of covalent n-cl bonds to staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans could be attached before killing took place. for s. aureus, 3 min incubation with nct produced a cover of  3.3 x 10(-16) mol cl(+)/cfu, while the cfu count was reduced by only 26%. the kind of microorganism, coating time, ph, buffer system and, basically, the chlorine compound, influenced the cover strength. the relative cover strength on  s. aureus by nct, chloramine t, sodium dichloro-isocyanurate or n,n-dichlorotaurine was 1:15.7:38.7:0.24. chlorine covers were surprisingly stable and could be detected for 3 h at 20 degrees c (>8 h at 1 degrees c), even  without a reduction of cfu. however, addition of 5% ammonium chloride caused a rapid loss of viability, explained by formation of highly bactericidal nh(2)cl, an effect that resembles the ignition of a time-bomb. conclusions: the chlorine cover can be regarded as the first sign of interaction between chlorinating agent and microorganism, and may explain the non-lethal features of postantibiotic effect and attenuation of bacterial virulence. furthermore, it may be a decisive  step in bacterial inactivation by the myeloperoxidase-hypochlorite system in innate immunity.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == evaluation of the uro-quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  == the uro-quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. in order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (nccls) and the uro-quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. the shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli and for esbl- and inhibitor-resistant tem (irt)-producing e. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). the same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation  and efflux-mediated), streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and m-type) and klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis and moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (oxa-r) staphylococcus aureus and oxa-r staphylococcus epidermidis. the same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by pseudomonas aeruginosa. teicoplanin-resistant staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (vana, vanb, vanc) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (hlar) enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. the results obtained indicate that uro-quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin against ocular pathogens.
AB  == the ideal ophthalmic anti-infective exhibits broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and atypical bacterial species. these pathogens can cause potentially blinding infections such as keratitis and endophthalmitis, both of which are associated with ophthalmic surgery or traumatic injury. these infections often require aggressive antibacterial therapy, preferably with newer  generations of antibiotics. in this study, minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values for gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined in vitro against bacterial strains that were isolated from suspected cases of bacterial keratitis  and endophthalmitis. the ocular isolates included 7 gram-positive, 4 gram-negative, and 3 atypical bacterial species. gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin exhibited similar activity against 6 gram-positive organisms: staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis. mic90 values for the drugs  against these isolates ranged from 0.08 mg/ml to 0.57 mg/ml and were comparable to previously published values against isolates from patients with systemic infections. the mic90 for gatifloxacin against streptococcus viridans was 0.22 mg/ml compared with 0.73 mg/ml for moxifloxacin (p = .011). among the gram-negative isolates, the mean mic90 for gatifloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1.28 mg/ml compared with 2.60 mg/ ml for moxifloxacin (p = .023).  mic90 values for gatifloxacin against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes were one fourth to one fifth the values for moxifloxacin. for the atypicals, the mic90 values for gatifloxacin against nocardia asteroides and mycobacterium chelonae were one fourth the corresponding values for moxifloxacin. gatifloxacin demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against several key ocular pathogens tested in this study and was at least as effective as moxifloxacin against these pathogens.

AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. changes in the bacterial susceptibility for czop were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint mic. sixteen species (2,363 strains) of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the  clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis  (msse), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse), staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus saprophyticus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp), penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp), streptococcus milleri group and peptostreptococcus spp. the antibacterial activity of czop either against mssa or msse was preferable (mic90: 2 or 0.5 micrograms/ml) and comparable to those of other cephems. czop was also effective  on mrse (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) but not on mrsa. czop and other cephems had low antibacterial activity against s. haemolyticus (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than those of other cephems, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (32 vs 1-2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop  against e. faecalis was comparable to that of cefpirome (cpr; mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) and higher than those of other cephems. no antibacterial activity  of czop against e. faecium and e. avium was observed, like other drugs. the antibacterial activity of czop against s. pyogenes was as potent as those of cefotiam and cpr (mic90: < or = 0.063 microgram/ml), and, against s. agalactiae,  was also preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml). czop indicated preferable antibacterial activity either against pssp, pisp, or prsp (mic90: 0.25, 1, or 2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. milleri group was also preferable, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (4 vs 0.5 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than those of cefazolin and cefmetazole. the resistance ratio estimated from breakpoint mic of czop was 95.9% in mrsa, 93.5% in prsp, 63.3% in pisp, 35.8% in s. haemolyticus, 27.9% in e. faecalis, and 13.3% mrse. those resistance ratios were comparable to those for cefepime (cfpm), but e. faecalis showed 91.2% for cfpm. the difference in the resistance ratio of e. faecalis demonstrated that czop successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against these species. in correlation of drug susceptibility, 40.3% of prsp was not inhibited at breakpoint mic either czop or  cfpm while 69.2% at breakpoint mic either czop or ceftazidime. in conclusion, the antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria obtained from the 6-year duration study were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. a decline in the sensitivities of s. saprophyticus, s. milleri group, pisp, and prsp to czop, however, was suggested.

TI  == innate immune response of oral and foreskin keratinocytes: utilization of different signaling pathways by various bacterial species.
AB  == the innate immune response is critical for the epithelial antimicrobial barrier.  the human beta-defensins are small, cationic antimicrobial peptides that are made by epithelial cells and that play a role in mucosal and skin defenses. human beta-defensin 1 (hbd-1) is expressed constitutively in epithelial tissues, whereas hbd-2 and hbd-3 are expressed in response to bacterial stimuli or inflammation. previous studies showed that hbd-2 was induced by fusobacterium nucleatum cell wall extract without the involvement of the nf-kappab transcription factors, which typically are associated with innate immunity and inflammation. the goal of this study was to characterize signaling pathways involved in hbd-2 induction in response to commensal and pathogenic bacteria. cultured human oral and foreskin keratinocytes were treated separately with inhibitors of nf-kappab, c-jun n-terminal kinase (jnk), and p38 and then stimulated with oral commensal streptococcus gordonii, oral pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, skin commensal staphylococcus epidermidis, or skin pathogen streptococcus pyogenes. different bacteria induced different levels of hbd-2 and in response to the various inhibitors tested, although certain common patterns were observed for commensal-  and pathogen-stimulated cells. hbd-2 induction by all bacteria tested was partially or completely blocked by inhibitors of the jnk and p38 pathways. however, in addition, hbd-2 induction by pathogenic bacteria in both oral and foreskin keratinocytes was blocked by inhibitors of nf-kappab. the results indicate that commensal and pathogenic bacteria utilize different pathways in hbd-2 induction and suggest that epithelial cells from different body sites have  common signaling mechanisms to distinguish between commensal and pathogenic bacteria.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and  penicillins. a total of 1,274 strains in 15 species of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa),  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, and peptostreptococcus spp. czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 6 years. the mic90 of czop against mrsa and s. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against s. pneumoniae and peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. however, the mic90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. increases in the mic90 against s. pneumoniae were also observed with ceftazidime (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), flomoxef (fmox), sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz), and imipenem (ipm). increases  in the mic90 against peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with fmox, sbt/cpz, and ipm. in conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. it, therefore, was suggested that czop had maintained high antibacterial activity during 6 years of post marketing.

TI  == six cases of bacterial infection in porous orbital implants.
AB  == background: we present 6 cases of bacterial infection that developed after porous orbital implant surgery. cases: five patients with hydroxyapatite implants showed lid swelling, discharge, and suppurative granuloma 14 days to 3 years after surgery. the hydroxyapatite implants were removed 14 days to 41 months postoperatively, and synthetic porous polyethylene orbital implants were inserted. thick discharge and conjunctival melting was noted 14 months after primary medpor implant surgery in the sixth patient, and the infection was controlled by medical therapy. observations: the culture of specimens removed with swabs from the conjunctiva of patients and from the hydroxyapatite implants  showed growth of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus and peptostreptococcus in 4 patients, whereas streptococcus pyogenes were cultured from the conjunctiva in the medpor implant patient. culture for the remaining patient was negative . conclusions: if there is continuous pain, injection, and discharge after porous implant insertion, bacterial infection in the implant should be considered immediately. systemic antibiotics and topical eye drops should be administered without delay. if no improvement is observed, the implant should be removed and a different approach must be considered.

TI  == small-fragment genomic libraries for the display of putative epitopes from clinically significant pathogens.
AB  == taking advantage of whole genome sequences of bacterial pathogens in many thriving diseases with global impact, we developed a comprehensive screening procedure for the identification of putative vaccine candidate antigens. importantly, this procedure relies on highly representative small-fragment genomic libraries that are expressed to display frame-selected epitope-size peptides on a bacterial cell surface and to interact directly with carefully selected disease-relevant high-titer sera. here we describe the generation of small-fragment genomic libraries of gram-positive and gram-negative clinically significant pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus  pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, helicobacter pylori, chlamydia pneumoniae, the enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, and campylobacter jejuni. large-scale sequencing revealed that the libraries, which provide an average of 20-fold coverage, were random and, as demonstrated with two s. aureus libraries, highly representative. consistent with the comprehensive nature of this approach is the  identification of epitopes that reside in both annotated and putatively novel open reading frames. the use of these libraries therefore allows for the rapid and direct identification of immunogenic epitopes with no apparent bias or difficulty that often associate with conventional expression methods.

TI  == comparative in vitro potency of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid and four oral agents  against recent north american clinical isolates from a global surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was compared with four comparator oral antimicrobial agents; ampicillin, azithromycin, cefuroxime and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole against 4536 recent clinical isolates covering 29  species isolated in the us and canada between 1997 and 1999. based upon minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics), amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was the most active agent against many gram-positive species and phenotypes including methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin intermediate and macrolide resistant strains and was as active as ampicillin against streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae and viridans streptococci. against enterobacteriaceae amoxycillin-clavulanic acid in general,  displayed weak activity with only proteus mirabilis and proteus vulgaris displaying levels of susceptibility above the 90th percentile. amoxycillin-clavulanic acid had significant activity against many species of gram-negative non-enterobacteriaceae including haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae and moraxella catarrhalis but negligible activity against burkholderia cepacia, pseudomonas aeruginosa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. amoxycillin-clavulanic acid continues to retain excellent activity against the majority of targeted pathogens despite 20 years of clinical use.

TI  == vitreous and aqueous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB  == objective: to investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous and aqueous humor after oral administration. methods: a prospective, nonrandomized study of 24 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy between september 2001 and may 2002 at the cullen eye institute. aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 24 patients  after administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before the operation. assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. results: mean +/- sd gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 23), vitreous (n = 23), and aqueous (n = 11) were 5.14 +/- 1.36 micro g/ml, 1.34  +/- 0.34 micro g/ml, and 1.08 +/- 0.54 micro g/ml respectively. mean +/- sd sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 3.2 +/- 1.0 hours, 4.0 +/- 1.0 hours, and 3.9 +/- 1.1 hours, respectively. the percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration  achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 26.17% and 21.02%, respectively. mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous mic(90 ) levels were achieved against many pathogens, including staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, propionibacterium acnes, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. conclusions: orally administered gatifloxacin achieves therapeutic levels in the noninflamed human eye, and the activity spectrum appropriately encompass the bacterial species most frequently involved in the various causes of endophthalmitis. because of its broad-spectrum coverage, low mic(90) levels for the organisms of concern, and good tolerability, gatifloxacin  represents a major advance in the prophylaxis or treatment of postoperative, posttraumatic, and bleb-associated bacterial endophthalmitis.

TI  == keratinocyte expression of human beta defensin 2 following bacterial infection: role in cutaneous host defense.
AB  == human beta defensin 2 (hbetad-2) is thought to play an important role in cutaneous immune defense. we hypothesized that (i) keratinocyte expression of hbetad-2, measured by reverse transcription-pcr, would be upregulated in response to challenge with pathogenic bacteria, particularly highly adherent strains of streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus, and (ii) hbetad-2 would have potent antimicrobial activity against pathogenic but not commensal organisms. expression of hbetad-2 was induced consistently by s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, whereas strains of s.  pyogenes were poor and variable inducers of hbetad-2. no correlation was found between levels of bacterial adherence and keratinocyte expression of hbetad-2. s. pyogenes was significantly more sensitive to killing by hbetad-2 than s. epidermidis. we conclude that the ability to induce hbetad-2 expression in combination with sensitivity to its antimicrobial effects may contribute to the rarity of skin infections with the gram-negative bacterial organisms, whereas lack of stimulation of hbetad-2 expression by s. pyogenes may be important in its ability to evade innate defenses and cause skin disease. induction of expression  of hbetad-2 but relative tolerance to it may enable s. epidermidis to survive on  the skin surface and modulate hbetad-2 expression when the stratum corneum barrier is disrupted.

TI  == skin and soft tissue infection.
AB  == abstract. normal skin is heavily colonized by bacterial flora. the most common are the various nonpathogenic gram-positive bacteria such as staphylococcus epidermidis (coagulase-negative). skin and soft tissue infections are usually caused by staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) and streptococcus pyogenes. this article discusses common and some not so common bacterial skin infections, including impetigo, folliculitis, furncles and carbuncles, cellulitis and erysipelas, gangrenous cellulitis, staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome and scarlet fever. impetigo and ecthyma are common bacterial infections of the skin commonly caused by s. aureus and / or group a streptoccus. in mild and localized  impetigo topical antibiotics whereas in widespread or severe one and in ecthyma systemic antibiotics like, cloxacillin, erythromycin, azithromycin or cephalexin  should be used. folliculitis, furunculosis and carbuncle are folliculocentric infections caused by s. aureus involving the variable depth and extent of the follicle(s) and surrounding tissue. these conditions can be treated with topical  or systemic antibiotics like cloxacillin, cephalexin, erythromycin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or vancomycin. staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome is a toxin mediated exfoliative dermatosis caused by s. aureus of phase group ii. intravenous penicillinase-resistant anti-staphylococcal antibiotics like methicillin, cloxacillin, cephalosporin or erythromycin are required. erysipelas  and cellulitis are acute infections of dermal and subcutaneous tissues caused most frequently by group a beta-hemolytic streptococci (erysipelas) or s. aureus  requiring systemic antibiotics like oral or intravenous penicillin, erythromycin, cephalexin, cloxacillin, vacomycin, minocycline or ciprofloxacin depending upon the severity, suspected causative organism and culture/sensitivity results. gangrenous cellulitis is characterized by infection with necrosis of skin and underlying subcutaneous tissue due to various pathogens occurring at different site. ampicillin, gentamicin, and either metronidazole or clindamycin intravenously in standard doses are recommended for the treatment.

TI  == the bacterial peptide n-formyl-met-leu-phe inhibits killing of staphylococcus epidermidis by human neutrophils in fibrin gels.
AB  == to study human neutrophil (polymorphonuclear leukocyte (pmn)) migration and killing of bacteria in an environment similar to that found in inflamed tissues in vivo, we have used fibrin gels. fibrin gels (1500 microm thick) containing staphylococcus epidermidis were formed in boyden-type chemotaxis chambers. pmn migrated < 300 microm into these gels in 6 h and did not kill s. epidermidis when the gels contained heat-inactivated serum, c5-deficient serum, a streptococcal peptidase specific for a fragment of cleaved c5 (c5a), or anti-c5ar igg. in contrast, in gels containing normal human serum, pmn migrated approximately 1000  microm into the gels in 4 h and into the full thickness of the gels in 6 h, and killed 90% of s. epidermidis in 6 h. fmlp reduced pmn migration into fibrin gels  and allowed s. epidermidis to increase by approximately 300% in 4 h, whereas leukotriene b(4) stimulated pmn to migrate the full thickness of the gels and to  kill 80% of s. epidermidis in 4 h. we conclude that both complement opsonization  and c5a-stimulated chemotaxis are required for pmn bacterial killing in fibrin gels, and that fmlp inhibits pmn bactericidal activity in fibrin gels. the latter finding is surprising and suggests that in the presence of fibrin fmlp promotes bacterial virulence.

AB  == the in vitro activity of daptomycin was assessed in comparison with that of vancomycin and penicillin against a wide range of gram-positive aerobic clinical  isolates. mics were determined by an agar dilution method on mueller-hinton agar  (nccls/eucast) and on isotonic agar adjusted to contain 50 mg/l free calcium (bsac). both media were enriched with 5% horse blood for fastidious organisms. daptomycin mics for all 172 staphylococci, including methicillin-susceptible and  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus, were 0.03-0.5 mg/l. for 99 of the 100 enterococci (enterococcus faecalis, n = 50; enterococcus faecium, n = 50), including 37 vancomycin-resistant isolates, they were 0.25-2 mg/l. for all 108 beta-haemolytic streptococci, including streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae, daptomycin mics were 0.016- 0.25 mg/l; for 101 alpha-haemolytic streptococci, including streptococcus pneumoniae and 'viridans' streptococci, they were 0.016-2 mg/l. for miscellaneous vancomycin-resistant isolates including lactobacillus spp., lactococcus spp., leuconostoc spp., pediococcus spp. and isolates of enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum, daptomycin mics were 0.03-2 mg/l; mics for the seven isolates of listeria monocytogenes were 0.25-4 mg/l. there was little difference between the results on mueller-hinton agar and  on supplemented isotonic agar the discrepant results occasionally obtained tended to be one dilution higher on supplemented isotonic agar. daptomycin was active (mics < or = 2 mg/l) against all the isolates tested with the exception of one isolate each of e. faecium and l. monocytogenes (mics = 4 mg/l). our results indicate that daptomycin mics are independent of methicillin and vancomycin mics.

TI  == susceptibility of a variety of clinical isolates to linezolid: a european inter-country comparison.
AB  == using standardized in vitro susceptibility tests, 3382 bacteria recently isolated from skin, blood or respiratory tract infections were analysed for their susceptibility to linezolid, a new oxazolidinone, and a number of comparator antibacterial agents. isolates originated in france, italy, germany, spain, sweden, the netherlands and the uk. laboratories in each country independently conducted broth microdilution susceptibility tests using nccls methods and epsilonometry (etest). isolates of gram-positive cocci tested in each laboratory  included methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus  pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus spp. isolates of moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae were also included. where appropriate, comparator drugs (oxacillin, vancomycin, gentamicin, co-amoxiclav, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, penicillin g, clindamycin and ampicillin) were also tested. linezolid demonstrated excellent activity against all of the gram-positive cocci with mic50s ranging from 0.5 to 4 mg/l. the drug demonstrated only modest activity against m. catarrhalis and h. influenzae with mic50s ranging from 4 to 16 mg/l.

TI  == identification of enterococcus, streptococcus, and staphylococcus by multivariate analysis of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic data from plate cultures.
AB  == a new fingerprinting technique with the potential for rapid identification of bacteria was developed by combining proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)h  mrs) with multivariate statistical analysis. this resulted in an objective identification strategy for common clinical isolates belonging to the bacterial species staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and the streptococcus milleri group. duplicate cultures of 104 different isolates were examined one or more times using (1)h mrs. a total of 312 cultures were examined. an optimized classifier was developed using a bootstrapping process and a seven-group linear discriminant analysis to provide objective classification of the spectra. identification of isolates was based on consistent high-probability  classification of spectra from duplicate cultures and achieved 92% agreement with conventional methods of identification. fewer than 1% of isolates were identified incorrectly. identification of the remaining 7% of isolates was defined as indeterminate.

TI  == evaluation of an automated culture system for detecting bacterial contamination of platelets: an analysis with 15 contaminating organisms.
AB  == background: approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. the time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. study design and methods: isolates  of bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, corynebacterium species, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus viridans were inoculated into day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 cfu per ml (2 units/organism). each bag was sampled 10 times (20 ml/sample). four ml of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 ml was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 ml into thioglycollate broth. results: with the exception of p. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. a range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. a mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 cfu/ml inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of p. acnes in anaerobic bottles. conclusion: bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 cfu per ml. p. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). however, p. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination.  such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet  storage.

TI  == killing of cutaneous microbial species by photodynamic therapy.
AB  == background: photodynamic therapy (pdt) utilizes photosensitizers and light. whereas pdt use in cancer treatment has been widely accepted, antimicrobial pdt (apdt) is still in its early stages of development. objectives: to study microbial killing in vitro using apdt. methods: we used a combination of methylene blue and visible light, and a range of microbial species representative of those encountered on the skin in health and disease. using standard light intensity conditions (slide projector, 25 cm distance from target, 42 mw cm(-2))  and methylene blue dye at 100 microg ml(-1), kill rates and subsequent d-values were determined against staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, corynebacterium minutissimum, propionibacterium acnes and candida albicans. results: d-values for these species were 72, 66, 48, 120, 30 and 660 s, respectively. the effects of light intensity on the killing of s. epidermidis showed the kill rate to be proportional to the light intensity. a high rate of cell kill was also obtained using natural sunlight. conclusions: overall, these results indicate that apdt of the skin may represent a useful alternative to conventional antimicrobial treatment.

TI  == comparative efficacy of gemifloxacin in experimental models of pyelonephritis and wound infection.
AB  == gemifloxacin (sb-265805) is a potent, novel fluoroquinolone with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. in this study, the efficacy of gemifloxacin was studied in experimental models of gram-negative pyelonephritis (caused by escherichia coli or proteus mirabilis) and gram-positive wound infection resulting from streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus epidermidis or staphylococcus aureus. gemifloxacin activity against these pathogens was compared with those of amoxycillin-clavulanate, ciprofloxacin, cefuroxime, azithromycin, trovafloxacin,  grepafloxacin, levofloxacin and tosufloxacin. oral treatment was initiated 1 h after infection and continued once or twice daily for 3 days. around 17 h after the end of treatment, animals were killed and the infected kidneys or the skin around the wound site were excised for the enumeration of viable bacteria. in the pyelonephritis model (either microorganism), gemifloxacin reduced bacterial numbers significantly (p < 0.01) compared with no treatment. no comparator agent  had a greater effect than gemifloxacin. notably, grepafloxacin and azithromycin were significantly less effective (p < 0.01) than gemifloxacin against e. coli pyelonephritis, and amoxycillin-clavulanate, azithromycin and trovafloxacin were  inferior (p < 0.01) against p. mirabilis infection. in the s. pyogenes wound infection model, gemifloxacin, amoxycillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime and azithromycin reduced bacterial numbers significantly compared with controls (p <  0.01). results for the comparator quinolones were not significantly different from untreated controls (p > 0.05). gemifloxacin was also effective against staphylococcal infection, as were grepafloxacin and levofloxacin, while ciprofloxacin, trovafloxacin and tosufloxacin were significantly less effective against these pathogens than gemifloxacin (p < 0.01). no comparator agent had greater activity than gemifloxacin against s. pyogenes or s. aureus infections. these data demonstrate the potential benefit of gemifloxacin in the treatment of  gram-negative urinary tract infection and gram-positive skin and soft tissue infection.

AB  == the results of the semi-annual nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities, conducted by the japanese ministry of health and welfare during the period of january 1993 to july 1995, were analyzed for typical gram-positive  cocci and gram-negative cocci in the purpose of provision of an index for antimicrobial selection. during these 3 years, streptococcus pyogenes (group a) and streptococcus agalactiae (group b) showed slightly increasing tendency in susceptibility to ofloxacin (oflx) and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (st), while  streptococcus pneumoniae and moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis showed slightly  decreasing tendency to cefaclor (ccl). however, these annual changes were almost  negligible. generally, these microorganisms showed relatively good susceptibilities, every year, to the principal antimicrobial agents being approved for use against gram-positive and -negative cocci. however, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis showed tendencies of decreased susceptibility to some of the antimicrobial agents. on the other hand, cefmetazole (cmz), vancomycin (vcm), latamoxef (lmox), st and minocycline (mino) showed good activities against some of the gram-positive and -negative cocci to which no indication are approved. in conclusion, beside the identification of the causative microorganisms and the performance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, such analyses (graphics of susceptibility tendency of clinical isolates to variety of antimicrobial agents)  could be used as an index for selection of antimicrobial agents, when emergent and urgent selection of an antimicrobial agent is necessary.

TI  == evaluation of in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin and comparator antimicrobial agents against worldwide clinical trial and other laboratory isolates.
AB  == this report summarizes the activities of quinupristin/dalfopristin (q/d) and appropriate comparator antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, rifampin, teicoplanin, and vancomycin, against selected gram-positive pathogens, including enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus  epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pyogenes. the study pathogens were obtained from 2 sources: (1) clinical isolates taken from patients participating in q/d worldwide phase iii comparative and noncomparative (emergency-use program) clinical trials; and (2) other isolates collected from the laboratories of 45 geographically distinct medical centers around the world. q/d was highly active, with minimum inhibitory  concentrations (mics) < or = 1.0 microg/ml against most isolates, including those known to be resistant to methicillin, vancomycin, or erythromycin. q/d was active (mics < or = 1 microg/ml) against 95% of the vancomycin-resistant e. faecium strains, for example, whereas ciprofloxacin was active against 6%. q/d was equally active against methicillin-susceptible or -resistant s. aureus strains (mic90=1 microg/ml), as was vancomycin (mic90=2 microg/ml), whereas ciprofloxacin was much less active against methicillin-resistant strains than against methicillin-susceptible strains (mic90=32 vs 1 microg/ml). given its spectrum of  activity, q/d may provide a viable option for the treatment of severe respiratory and skin and skin-structure infections caused by gram-positive bacteria, especially when strains with known or suspected resistance to other commonly used antibiotics are present.

TI  == mucin gene (muc 2 and muc 5ac) upregulation by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == bacterial infection of the lung is associated with mucin overproduction. in partial explanation of this phenomenon, we recently reported that supernatant from the gram-negative organism pseudomonas (p.) aeruginosa contained an activity that upregulated transcription of the muc 2 mucin gene [j.-d. li, a. dohrman, m.  gallup, s. miyata, j. gum, y. kim, j. nadel, a. prince, c. basbaum, transcriptional activation of mucin by p. aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide in the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis lung disease, proc. natl. acad. sci. u.s.a., 94 (1997) 967-972]. the purpose of the present study was to determine whether mucin  genes other than muc 2 are so regulated and whether gram-positive organisms also  contain mucin stimulatory activity. results from in situ hybridization and rnase  protection assays showed that p. aeruginosa upregulates muc 5ac as well as muc 2  in both bronchial explants and cultured airway epithelial cells. the upregulation of both genes by p. aeruginosa can be mimicked by lipopolysaccharide (lps) and can be blocked by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. in addition, both genes are upregulated by a variety of gram-positive as well as gram-negative organisms showing the same rank order of potency. these data indicate the existence of a general mechanism by which epithelial cells respond to the presence of bacteria by increasing mucin synthesis.

AB  == cfc-222 is a novel fluoroquinolone with potent and broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. the in-vitro and in-vivo activities of cfc-222 were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin and sparfloxacin. against gram-positive bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus (quinolone-susceptible and quinolone-resistant), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis, cfc-222 was more active than ciprofloxacin and similar to  sparfloxacin. against gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacteriaceae, the in-vitro activity of cfc-222 was similar to that of sparfloxacin, but less than that of ciprofloxacin. however, it was less active than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. in mouse systemic infection caused by s. aureus smith or s. aureus tms 33, cfc-222 demonstrated an activity similar  to that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, but better than that of ofloxacin. the compound was more effective than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin in murine infection caused by streptococcus pyogenes atcc 8668. against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae infections, the efficacy of cfc-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and sparfloxacin. the activity of cfc-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against p. aeruginosa mb4-16 in the same infection model. these results suggest that cfc-222 may be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of various bacterial infections.

TI  == occurrence of peptidyl d-amino acids in soluble fractions of several eubacteria,  archaea and eukaryotes.
AB  == the occurrence of peptidyl d-amino acids in the aqueous soluble fractions was investigated in various eubacteria, some archaea and some eukaryotes. the contents of the d-enantiomers of serine, alanine, proline, glutamate (glutamine), aspartate (asparagine) and phenylalanine were determined with cell- and tissue-extracts, by means of acid hydrolysis and high-performance liquid chromatography. the rate of d-enantiomer (%, the ratio in molar concentration of  a d-amino acid to the total of the d-amino acid and the corresponding l-amino acid) of alanine and glutamate were high in some gram-positive eubacteria: 11.7%  in staphylococcus epidermidis and 10.3% in streptococcus pyogenes for alanine, and 22.3% for glutamate in bacillus yn-1. the d-glutamate content was also high (8.0%) in the gram-negative eubacterium, thiobacillus ferrooxidans. d-aspartate was common, as was d-glutamate: the highest d-aspartate content was detected in an archaeum, pyrobaculum islandicum (4.0%). however, the content of d-aspartate was low, 0.2-1.8% in most other bacteria. the presence of d-serine was shown in some organisms, but that of d-proline was scarce. the d-enantiomer of phenylalanine was not detected in any of the organisms examined. these results indicate that of the bacteria examined herein most gram-negative and some gram-positive eubacteria, as well as archaea contain only low levels of d-amino acids in the soluble peptidyl fraction, and the levels were comparable to those in eukaryotes examined. to our knowledge, the general presence of peptidyl d-amino acids in these organisms, especially archaea and eukaryotic cells including those from rat liver tissues, has been shown here for the first time.

TI  == bacterial growth in human vitreous humor.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the capacity of human vitreous to support bacterial growth and to show differences in the growth kinetics of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. vitreous gel of 70 keratoplasty donor eyes was sampled under sterile conditions, screened microscopically for cellular  components and tested for sterility and levels of antibiotic drugs by bio-assay.  the samples were inoculated with clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus viridans and streptococcus pyogenes. as control each strain was added both to 0.9% sodium chloride solution and to mueller-hinton broth. in order to determine bacterial growth the number of colony forming units was determined 4, 6, 24, 48 and 72 hr after inoculation by viable count. vitreous gel did not support bacterial growth; the tested strains could not be recovered after 48 hr.  similar results could be obtained with sodium chloride; whereas in mueller hinton broth the strains showed normal pattern of growth. it seems that vitreous humor has inherent antibacterial capacity in vitro, although the responsible factors remain unknown.

TI  == [comparative antimicrobial activity of rp 59,500 (quinupristin-dalfopristin), the first semisynthetic injectable streptgramin, against gram-positive cocci and other recent clinical pathogens].
AB  == rp 59,500 (quinupristin-dalfopristin) is the first semisynthetic injectable streptogramin antimicrobial agent, which is a combination of quinupristin and dalfopristin in a 30:70 ratio. the components of rp 59,500 act synergically to provide bactericidal activity through action at different sites on bacterial ribosomes. in the present study, the antimicrobial activity of rp 59,500 was compared with those of four macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, roxithromycin). susceptibility testing was carried out by microdilution method on 303 strains of 10 species, especially antibiotic-resistant gram-positive cocci. rp 59,500 was active against a wide range of gram-positive cocci including methicillin-resistant staphylococci and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the mics90 of rp 59,500 against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and staphylococcus epidermidis were both 0.25 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. the mics90 of rp 59,500 against penicillin-sensitive, -intermediate and -resistant s. pneumoniae were all 0.5 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. rp 59,500 also exhibited equivalent activities to the four macrolides against strains of streptococcus pyogenes. streptococcus agalactiae and moraxella catarrhalis. rp 59,500 exhibited the highest activities against enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus avium strains which  are intrinsically resistant to most antimicrobial agents. no cross-resistance was observed between rp 59,500 and the four macrolides, which will merit attention in future clinical trials of the agent. the effect of human serum on the mic of rp 59,500 was studied with strains of s. aureus, s. epidermidis and e. faecalis. the presence of 20% (v/v) serum had little or no effect on the mic, although 50% (v/v) serum increased mics by 4-8 folds. laboratory-induced resistance to rp 59,500 occurred in a stepwise fashion in broth cultures of s. aureus, s. epidermidis and e. facalis strains and the induction rate was slow and no more than four fold increases were observed. population analysis was performed on rp 59,500 and the reference macrolides against s. aureus atcc 25,923 strain. although low frequencies (less than 0.01%) of resistant sub-population were detected with em, cam, azm and rxm, no rp 59,500-resistant sub-population was detected in this study.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of roxithromycin against recently obtained clinical isolates].
AB  == the purpose of our investigation was to monitor current trends in the susceptibility patterns of clinical bacterial isolates to roxithromycin (rxm). we measured the mics of macrolide antibiotics, such as rxm, erythromycin (em), clarithromycin (cam), rokitamycin (rkm) and midecamycin (mdm), and other classes  of antibacterial compounds against various clinical isolates at seven institutions between october and december in 1994 and 1995. rxm had excellent antibacterial activities for s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, m. (b.) catarrhalis and  methicillin sensitive s. aureus. against methicillin sensitive s. epidermidis, rxm activity was fairly good but about 20% of the strains had mic > or = 128 micrograms/ml. the activity against s. pneumoniae was not so potent and similar to activities of em, cam, mdm, and clindamycin. the vast majority of methicillin  resistant s. aureus and s. epidermidis were also resistant to macrolide antibiotics and other classes of compounds tested. in conclusion, rxm is an unique macrolide antibiotic by retaining potent activity against s. pyogenes, s.  agalactiae, s. aureus except mrsa, m. (b.) catarrhalis and m. pneumoniae.

TI  == role of coagulase in a murine model of hematogenous pulmonary infection induced by intravenous injection of staphylococcus aureus enmeshed in agar beads.
AB  == we describe a novel mouse model of acute staphylococcal pneumonia induced by intravenous injection of staphylococcus aureus enmeshed in agar beads. for comparison, we also used various strains of bacteria, including three strains of  s. aureus, two strains of staphylococcus epidermidis, one strain of streptococcus pyogenes, three strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, and one strain of klebsiella pneumoniae. all except two strains of s. aureus were cleared rapidly from the lungs. when s. aureus numr1 enmeshed in agar beads was injected intravenously, the organisms concentrated and remained in the lung for a period longer than several weeks. multiple lung abscesses were evident macroscopically, and histological examination of the infected lung showed multiple lung abscesses around the pulmonary arterioles, consisting of bacterial colonies encircled with  fibrin filaments and surrounded by inflammatory cells of neutrophils and macrophages. when 14 strains of clinically isolated s. aureus were injected intravenously, the number of bacteria recovered from the lung tissue 7 days after infection correlated with the titer of staphylocoagulase (p < 0.01) but not with  the titer of clumping factor. injection of coagulase-deficient mutant strain du5843 was associated with a markedly reduced number of viable bacteria isolated  from the lung, compared with its coagulase-positive parental strain du5789. our results suggest that coagulase may play a role in the development of blood-borne  staphylococcal pneumonia in our model. our animal model is simple and reproducible and resembles blood-borne staphylococcal pneumonia in humans, and it could be useful for investigating the pathogenicity or treatment of staphylococcal pulmonary infection, including infections with methicillin-resistant s. aureus.

TI  == evaluation of swirling, ph, and glucose tests for the detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: although infrequent, episodes of transfusion-associated bacterial sepsis may lead to serious outcomes or death and therefore are of concern. this study evaluates the sensitivity of three surrogate tests for the presence of bacteria in platelet concentrates: cessation of swirling, low extracellular ph, and low plasma glucose levels. study design and methods: day 0 platelet concentrates were inoculated with low levels of one of seven bacterial strains and stored with agitation at 20 to 24 degrees c for up to 5 days. in the morning  and afternoon of each day of storage, bacterial levels were ascertained by quantitative plate culture, and platelet concentrates were tested for platelet ph, plasma glucose, and swirling. quantitative and semiquantitative dipstick techniques were used to determine ph and glucose levels. results: platelet concentrates had attained stationary phase growth of streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus mitis, or staphylococcus epidermidis (> or = 10(7) -10(8) colony-forming units [cfu]/ml) before either the swirling or dipstick methods suggested the presence of bacteria. the sensitivity of swirling and glucose tests for detecting bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates was generally comparable. although the sensitivity of the ph test was generally similar to that of swirling and glucose tests for most bacteria, platelet concentrates contaminated with e. cloacae had normal ph despite the presence of high levels of bacteria (> or = 10(7)-10(8) cfu/ml). conclusion: the sensitivity in detection of bacteria in platelet concentrates by the swirling technique or by measuring extracellular ph or plasma glucose is less than the sensitivity reported for microscopy with gram stain (10(5)-10(6) cfu/ml), fluorescence microscopy with acridine orange stain (10(4)-10(5) cfu/ml), chemiluminescence detection of ribosomal rna (10(3)-10(4) cfu/ml), and automated bacterial culture (1 cfu/sample volume).

AB  == certain derivatives of the glycopeptide antibiotic ly264826 with n-alkyl-linked substitutions on the epivancosamine sugar are active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci. six compounds representing our most active series were evaluated for activity against antibiotic-resistant, gram-positive pathogens. for enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis resistant to both vancomycin  and teicoplanin, the mics of the six semisynthetic compounds for 90% of the strains tested were 1 to 4 micrograms/ml, compared with 2,048 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 256 micrograms/ml for ly264826. for e. faecium and e. faecalis resistant to vancomycin but not teicoplanin, the mics were 0.016 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 64 to 1,024 micrograms/ml for vancomycin. the compounds were highly active against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci and against e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus and showed some activity against isolates of highly vancomycin-resistant leuconostocs and pediococci. the mics for 90% of the strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus tested were typically 0.25 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 microgram/ml for vancomycin. against methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis mics ranged from 0.25 to 2 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 to 4 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 4 to 16 micrograms/ml for teicoplanin. the spectrum of these new compounds included activity against teicoplanin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci. the compounds exhibited exceptional potency against pathogenic streptococci, with mics of < or = 0.008 microgram/ml against streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant isolates. in in vivo studies with a mouse infection model, the median effective doses against a challenge by s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, or s. pyogenes were typically 4 to 20 times lower than those of vancomycin. overall, these new glycopeptides, such as ly307599 and ly333328, show promise for use as agents against resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci.

TI  == in-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial activity of lb10517, a novel catechol-substituted cephalosporin with a broad antibacterial spectrum.
AB  == lb10517 is a new injectable cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial  activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. lb10517 inhibited 90%  of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) at 0.25 mg/l (mic90), and was 8-fold more active than cefpirome. lb10517 was two- or four-fold more active  than cefpirome against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse), streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis. both methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis (mrse) were highly resistant to all compounds. lb10517 activity against most enterobacteriaceae was  comparable to or greater than that of cefpirome, and it also showed high activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa. in a mouse septicaemia model, lb10517 exhibited excellent protective effects. in a respiratory tract infection model, the protective effect of lb10517 was comparable to that of cefpirome and ceftazidime. it was highly stable to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases, showing better physiological efficiency for tem-9 than the other test compounds. lb10517 had the most potent antibacterial activity against beta-lactamase producing resistant strains. lb10517 did not induce beta-lactamase production in enterobacter cloacae 1194e.

TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == necrotizing fasciitis: the role of staphylococcus epidermidis, immune status and  intravascular coagulation.
AB  == an 83 year old caucasian woman with necrotizing fasciitis (nf) of the right hand  is described. staphylococcus epidermidis was the only organism cultured. serology failed to demonstrate streptococcus pyogenes, the common pathogen of nf. despite  antibiotic therapy, gangrene supervened, necessitating digital amputation. staphylococcus epidermidis is usually non-pathogenic, but review of the literature indicates that it is relatively commonly found with other pathogens in nf. accordingly, studies of immune status were undertaken. apart from reduced myeloperoxidase production (30-50% of normal levels), all humoral, cell-mediated  and neutrophil function tests were normal. this is the first report of staphylococcus epidermidis as the sole isolate in nf and also the only study of immune status of nf patients. it is concluded that a non-virulent organism (e.g.  staphylococcus epidermidis) may be pathogenic in the face of advanced age alone.  elevated fibrin degradation productions were also demonstrated in the patient, consistent with lysis of localized intravascular thrombus. the role of anticoagulation in nf is discussed.

TI  == bacterial interference in vitro. comparison between a quantitative kinetic and a  cocultivation blood agar test method.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to compare two methods for estimation of bacterial growth interference between various bacteria using a bioscreen robot analyzer, allowing kinetic documentation, and a cocultivation test on blood agar  plates. six laboratory strains with different virulence and growth requirements were used: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus mitis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. the interference activity was correlated with a reference system of streptococcus sanguis (strain alpha 89) and streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococci, gas serotypes t 9 and t 22). the methods used and results obtained were as follows: 1. estimation of synergistic and antagonistic bacterial interferences using a bioscreen robot analyzer. suspensions of viable bacteria were added to microtiter plates with different concentrations of uv light-killed bacteria in liquid media. the bioscreen analyzer monitored bacterial growth every 10 min for 24 h giving kinetic data during the growth period. synergisms as well as antagonisms were demonstrated between the tested bacterial  strains which have not earlier been reported in the literature. however, the antagonistic effect observed between the six strains was less than that induced by the s. sanguis strain on the two strains of s. pyogenes. 2. cocultivation of bacterial strains on blood agar surface with precultivated or simultaneously stamped interfering bacteria indicated no detectable interference between the six tested bacterial strains, while the s. sanguis strain inhibited the growth of s.  pyogenes strains as well as the hemolysis around the colonies. the bioscreen method was found more sensitive for testing bacterial interference compared to the commonly used blood agar test.

AB  == the in-vitro activity of cefdinir (cl-983, fk482), an orally absorbed aminothiazole cephalosporin, was compared with that of penicillin, ampicillin, amoxycillin, amoxycillin/clavulanic acid (2/1), cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefixime, cefotaxime, vancomycin and erythromycin against 370 clinical isolates of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. cefdinir was highly active against staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis, inhibiting 90% of the strains at doses  of 0.25 and 0.5 mg/l respectively. however, cefdinir was not active against methicillin-resistant s. aureus (range 16- > 128 mg/l). the respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and s. pyogenes were also susceptible (mic90 < or = 0.5 mg/l), but against enterococcus spp. cefdinir displayed no useful activity. the common members of the family enterobacteriaceae were susceptible (mic90 < or = 1 mg/l), but those possessing chromosomal beta-lactamases were more resistant (mic90 2-8 mg/l). the presence of human serum had little effect on mics of cefdinir. these results indicate that cefdinir exhibited a wide spectrum for an oral cephalosporin and support its possible clinical use against susceptible pathogens in infections of the skin, soft tissue, respiratory and urinary tracts.

TI  == [clinical study on cefprozil in pediatrics].
AB  == clinical efficacy and safety of cefprozil (cfpz, bmy-28100), a newly developed oral cephalosporin, were studied in our pediatric department. clinical effectiveness, bacteriological effectiveness and side effects were studied in 116 pediatric patients with ages ranging 4 months to 11 years. cfpz was given 4.6-14.1 mg/kg daily in 3 times for 3-10 days. clinical efficacies were evaluated in 112 patients, and the therapeutic effectiveness were excellent in 1 and good in 6 for 7 patients with acute pharyngitis, excellent in 24 and good in 26 for acute purulent tonsillitis, excellent in 3, good in 8 and fair in 1 for acute bronchitis, excellent in 21, good in 7, fair in 1 and poor in 1 for acute pneumonia, excellent in 1 acute purulent parotitis, excellent in 2 and good in 7  for acute uti, good in 1 impetigo, fair in 1 periproctal abscess and good in 1 acute enteritis. the effectiveness rate was 96.4%. bacteriologically, 4 strains of staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase producing strains), 1 strain of staphylococcus epidermidis (beta-lactamase producing strain), 2 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains of streptococcus agalactiae, 4 strains of beta-streptococcus, 1 strain of klebsiella pneumoniae (beta-lactamase producing strain) and 1 strain of salmonella c2 were all disappeared, and of 22 strains of  streptococcus pyogenes, 20 strains were disappeared, 1 was decreased and 1 was unknown, of 5 strains of escherichia coli (3 beta-lactamase producing strains), 4 were disappeared and 1 was decreased, of 29 strains of haemophilus influenzae (14 beta-lactamase producing strains), 14 were disappeared, 11 were decreased, 3 persisted and 1 was unknown and of 2 strains of haemophilus parainfluenzae (1 beta-lactamase producing strain), 1 was disappeared and 1 persisted. the bacteriological eradication rates for gram-positive bacteria and gram-negative bacteria were 97.1% and 56.8%, respectively, and the drug was especially effective against gram-positive bacteria. no side effects nor refusal of ingestion were observed. as abnormalities in laboratory test results, 3 cases of  elevation of eosinophil counts and 1 of elevation of platelet counts were observed. in conclusion, cfpz was considered to be a safe and highly effective antibiotic in pediatric infections.

TI  == mhc-unrestricted recognition of bacteria-infected target cells by human cd8+ cytotoxic t lymphocytes.
AB  == a cd8+ alpha beta tcr+ t cell clone (a35) was isolated from the synovial fluid of a patient with post-enteric reactive arthritis caused by yersinia enterocolitica. this clone efficiently killed autologous and allogeneic target cells that had been preincubated with live but not with heat-killed bacteria. there was no restriction by polymorphic parts of hla-a, -b, or -c molecules and a hla class ii-deficient mutant cell line was lysed as efficiently as its normal counterpart, whereas infected hla class i-deficient cells (daudi cells) were not. the clone showed crossreaction between yersinia enterocolitica, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and streptococcus pyogenes, but did not lyse target cells preincubated with staphylococcus epidermidis. mab to cd2, cd3, and cd8 efficiently blocked a35, whereas the addition of mab to hla class ii or to hla class i did not. this clone apparently represents a novel effector mechanism against bacteria-infected or -modified cells that could be involved in the immunopathology of reactive arthritis.

TI  == in vitro activity of cefodizime.
AB  == cefodizime is a bactericidal cephem with the typical broad spectrum activity of an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, including both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria: its mic90 is 0.125 mg/l for streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and other streptococci; and 0.05 mg/l for haemophilus spp., neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae and moraxella catarrhalis; while beta-lactamase positive strains of m. catarrhalis require 1 mg/l. less than 1 mg/l is needed for escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus spp. and shigella spp. the mic90 is 4 mg/l for methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, morganella morganii, providencia spp. and most strains of serratia marcescens, citrobacter spp. and enterobacter spp. staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis and most strains of pseudomonas spp. and acinetobacter spp. are considered cefodizime-resistant. cefodizime is unaffected by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but it is hydrolyzed by some chromosomally mediated enzymes, thus resembling other third-generation cephalosporins. cefodizime has high affinity for pbp 3 and pbp ia and ib (escherichia coli); in s. aureus it shows the highest affinity for pbp 1.

TI  == antimicrobial treatment of otitis media.
AB  == the major pathogens causing acute otitis media (aom) are streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae, with moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus less frequently isolated. the same organisms and staphylococcus epidermidis are found in chronic otitis media with effusion. in chronic suppurative otitis media, pseudomonas aeruginosa and s aureus are most frequently found. antimicrobial agents found to be most effective in treating aom are amoxicillin, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, erythromycin-sulfisoxazole, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and cefaclor. cefuroxime axetil and cefixime are alternatives for which there are less data. currently, about 20% of aom cases are caused by beta-lactamase-producing strains (usually h influenzae or m catarrhalis) that are resistant to amoxicillin, thus favoring the use of the other agents listed. concentrations of antibiotics in middle ear infections range from 10% to 76% of peak serum levels for the listed agents and are higher in aom  than in chronic otitis media with effusion, emphasizing the importance of adequate dosing for successful treatment.

AB  == fifty-five tonsils removed for chronic tonsillar disease (chronic tonsillitis and obstructive tonsillar hyperplasia) underwent surface swab and quantitative core cultures in order to identify the relationship between core bacterial concentration and the presence of aerobic bacteria on the tonsil surface. the accuracy of a single core culture was further established by quantitative cultures of 9 sections per tonsil in an additional 19 tonsils. the results indicate that many (61.5%) but not all aerobic bacteria which were found in the tonsil core were cultured from the surface of the tonsil. conversely, the tonsil  core bacteria with the highest bacterial concentrations are more likely to be present on the tonsillar surface and the greater the bacterial concentration, the more likely the bacteria are to be found in most if not all areas of the tonsil core. therefore, the core bacterial concentration appears to be related to the presence of aerobic bacteria on the tonsillar surface. surface bacteria may not,  however, be truly representative of the core bacterial environment. implications  for the management of chronic tonsillar disease will be discussed.

TI  == clinical comparison of cefuroxime axetil, cephalexin and cefadroxil in the treatment of patients with primary infections of the skin or skin structures.
AB  == this study was designed to compare the clinical and bacteriological efficacy of three oral cephalosporins, cefuroxime axetil, cephalexin and cefadroxil, in the treatment of patients with mild to moderate infections of the skin or skin structures. a total of 330 patients were enrolled at 10 centers and were randomly assigned to receive cefuroxime axetil 250 mg (n = 107), cephalexin 500 mg (n = 111) or cefadroxil 500 mg (n = 112), twice daily for 10 days. patients were assessed for their clinical and bacteriological responses once during treatment (3-5 days) and twice after treatment (1-3 and 10-14 days). a total of 353 bacterial isolates were obtained: staphylococcus aureus (41%), staphylococcus epidermidis (33%) and streptococcus pyogenes (5%). a satisfactory clinical outcome (cure or improvement) was achieved in 97% (89/92), 89% (80/90) and 94% (82/87) of the clinically evaluable patients treated with cefuroxime axetil, cephalexin or cefadroxil, respectively (p = 0.047, cefuroxime axetil vs. cephalexin). with respect to the eradication of the bacterial pathogens, a satisfactory outcome (cure or presumed cure) was obtained in 96% (69/72), 85% (60/71) and 93% (63/68) of bacteriologically evaluable patients treated with cefuroxime axetil, cephalexin and cefadroxil, respectively (p = 0.026, cefuroxime axetil vs. cephalexin). all three study drugs were well tolerated, with adverse events affecting the gastrointestinal system most commonly reported. there were no significant differences between treatment groups in the incidence of drug-related adverse events.

AB  == macrolide (ml) susceptibilities of clinically isolated bacteria obtained freshly  during 1989 were determined and year to year differences in ml-resistances of the clinical isolates in our laboratory were examined with epidemiological consideration in mind. 1. the distribution of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of mls against isolates of staphylococcus aureus showed 2 peaks, one peak  representing s. aureus isolates susceptible to mls and the other peak representing those resistant to mls. proportions of resistant isolates to various mls were 36% to erythromycin, 24% each to kitasamycin, josamycin, midecamycin and midecamycin acetate. mics of rokitamycin (rkm), however, distributed themselves into 3 peaks of less than or equal to 0.39 micrograms/ml (76%), 1.56-3.13 micrograms/ml (12%) and greater than or equal to 100 micrograms/ml (12%). staphylococcus spp. including staphylococcus epidermidis showed different resistance characteristics to 14-membered ring mls and to 16-membered ring mls. further, the proportion of resistant organisms to rkm was the smallest among proportions of resistant organisms to various 16-membered ring mls tested. these  differences in proportions of resistant organisms to different mls may have resulted from differences in resistance induction activities of different mls. the above described ratios of resistant organisms to mls among s. aureus did not  vary since 1975 among clinical isolates tested in our laboratory. 2. four per cent (4%) of streptococcus pyogenes isolates were mls resistant, and 18% of streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were resistant to mls. among the isolates tested in our laboratory since 1985, resistant isolates of s. pyogenes are clearly decreasing and those of s. pneumoniae seem to be increasing.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the antibacterial activity of a new 7-dimethylpyridinyl quinolone, win 57273, was assessed by using in vitro and in vivo models. agar inclusion and broth dilution  in vitro tests revealed broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive and selected gram-negative organisms, with the greatest potency observed against the  staphylococci. the mic for 90% of coagulase-positive strains tested (mic90) was less than or equal to 0.002 micrograms/ml; for the coagulase-negative strains the mic90 was 0.008 micrograms/ml. against enterococci the mic90 was 0.06 micrograms/ml, with comparable activity observed against group a and group b streptococci as well as against the pneumococci. in general, the mic90s for the gram-negative bacteria were less than or equal to 1 micrograms/ml. exceptions were serratia marcescens (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml), citrobacter freundii (mic90,  4 micrograms/ml), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). the greatest potency was observed against haemophilus spp. and neisseria spp., with mic90s of 0.06 and 0.016 micrograms/ml, respectively. broad-spectrum activity was also observed against anaerobes, with mic90s ranging from 0.125 to 0.5 micrograms/ml among the species tested. the in vivo efficacy was determined by using a murine model by calculating the 50% protective doses against a lethal bacterial infection caused by strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the staphylocci were most susceptible, with 50% protective doses for  all strains ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 mg/kg. with the exception of the pseudomonas  infection, which was refractory to treatment, animals that were part of the other infection models responded to less than 10 mg/kg. equivalent activity was seen with the subcutaneous or the oral route of drug administration. win 57273 was significantly more potent than ciprofloxacin in treating gram-positive bacterial  infections (2- to 20-fold) but was significantly less effective at treating gram-negative bacterial infections (30- to 300-fold).

TI  == adherence of staphylococcus epidermidis to fibrin-platelet clots in vitro mediated by lipoteichoic acid.
AB  == the adherence of two strains of staphylococcus epidermidis to human fibrin-platelet clots in vitro was investigated. both strains were noncapsulated, nonhemagglutinating, and nonslime producers. binding was not related to surface charge, carbohydrate profile, or hydrophobicity of the bacteria. adherence was reduced four- to sixfold (p less than 0.001) on pretreatment of bacteria with lipase, while neuraminidase, trypsin, phospholipase c, and sodium periodate did not alter their binding. pretreatment of bacteria with substances known to bind lipoteichoic acid (lta), such as human albumin and anti-lta antibodies, also resulted in a fourfold (p less than 0.001) reduction in adherence. prior incubation of clots with free lta, but not with deacylated lta, produced a fourfold (p less than 0.001) decrease in the adherence of homologous and heterologous strains of s. epidermidis. a similar reduction was also observed when ltas derived from staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes were used. these data provide evidence that the lipid moiety of lta has a central role in the adherence of s. epidermidis to fibrin-platelet clots in vitro.

TI  == contact neodynium-yttrium-aluminum garnet laser acts as a sterilizing scalpel.
AB  == as a cold knife cuts through contaminated or infected wounds, bacteria are dragged along with the blade of the knife through the entire wound. herein, the effect of incisions made with a cold knife is compared with that of incisions made by a contact neodynium-yttrium-aluminum garnet (nd:yag) laser. agar plates were inoculated with multiple strains of exogenous, endogenous, hospital-acquired and multiple antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria. while the cold knife dragged bacteria to sterile areas, incisions made with the contact laser were always sterile. in addition to not dragging bacteria, the tip of the contact laser sterilized itself and provided a bacteria-free zone on either side of the cut, depending on the power density applied. it appears that the contact nd:yag laser acts as a sterilizing wand while providing much needed tactile feedback, precision and hemostasis during surgical treatment with the laser.

TI  == deficient intracellular killing of bacteria by murine alveolar macrophages.
AB  == microbiologic methods were used to assess the in vitro phagocytosis and intracellular killing of various species of bacteria by freshly isolated murine peritoneal and alveolar macrophages. peritoneal macrophages showed effective phagocytosis of opsonized streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, and listeria monocytogenes, and moderate ingestion of staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. alveolar macrophages were poor in phagocytosing opsonized s. pyogenes, s. aureus, and e. coli; ingestion of s. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, and s. epidermidis was moderate. peritoneal macrophages killed 40 to 80% of these bacteria intracellularly, but alveolar macrophages showed almost no intracellular killing of bacteria. to find  out whether there is a correlation between the poor bactericidal activity of alveolar macrophages and the oxygen-dependent microbicidal mechanisms of these cells, we determined the uptake of oxygen and the release of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide by macrophages at rest and after stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (pma) or opsonized s. aureus. upon exposure to these stimuli, peritoneal macrophages, but not alveolar macrophages, showed an increased uptake  of oxygen and release of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide. because alveolar macrophages contain surface active material (sam), we investigated the phagocytosis and intracellular killing of bacteria and the release of hydrogen peroxide by peritoneal macrophages pretreated with sam. the results showed reduced phagocytosis and impaired intracellular killing of s. epidermidis by these macrophages. the release of hydrogen peroxide by sam-pretreated peritoneal  macrophages upon stimulation with pma or opsonized s. aureus was equal to that of the control peritoneal macrophages.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil (cpdx-pr, cs-807), a newly developed oral cephem, were carried out in the treatment of infectious diseases in the field of pediatrics. 1. since cpdx demonstrates very powerful antimicrobial actions against such gram-negative bacilli as escherichia coli, salmonella sp., klebsiella pneumoniae and serratia sp., such gram-positive cocci as streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-lactamase producing branhamella catarrhalis and haemophilus  influenzae, this drug was thought to be useful for the treatment of pediatric infectious diseases when main causative bacteria in the field of pediatrics were  taken into account. 2. when changes in blood and urine concentrations of cpdx following the administration of this drug at 3.7 mg/kg before meal were determined, cmax and t1/2 were found to be 2.98 micrograms/ml at 2-hour and 1.73  hours, respectively; an urinary excretion rate in the first 6 hours and a maximum urine concentration were 32.5% and 52 micrograms/ml, respectively. 3. clinically, 8 of 8 patients with the upper respiratory tract infections (100%), 28 of 29 patients with bronchitis and/or pneumonia (96.6%), 3 of 4 patients with otitis media (75%), 2 of 2 patients with sinusitis (100%), 3 of 3 patients with the skin soft tissue infections (100%), 1 of 1 patient with bacterial enteritis (100%) and 11 of 14 patients with urinary tract infections (78.6%) responded well to the treatment with cpdx-pr, showing a 91.8% efficacy rate in all the patients treated. 4. bacteriologically, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, b. catarrhalis, h. influenzae, e. coli and salmonella typhimurium were all eradicated from 5, 1, 4, 6, 1, 5, 5, 11 and 1 patient, respectively. an eradication rate in all the patients examined was 97.5% (39/40). 5. gastrointestinal symptoms appeared as side effects in 2 of 71 patients (vomiting in 1 and diarrhea in 1), hence, an incidence of side effects was 2.8% (2/71). as for abnormal laboratory findings, eosinophilia, thrombocytosis and increases in got and gpt were observed in 3 of 39 patients examined (7.7%), 1 of 39 patients (2.6%) and 2 of 34 patients (5.9%), respectively. in addition, we also examined the effect of the drug on the hemostatic system, but found no changes upon the treatment. based on these results, it appeared that cpdx-pr was a useful and safe drug in treatment of infectious diseases in the field of pediatrics when administered 2-3 times a day  at a dose of 3-6 mg/kg.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of julifloricine isolated from prosopis juliflora.
AB  == antimicrobial activity of julifloricine, an alkaloid isolated from prosopis juliflora, was studied in vitro against 40 microorganisms which included 31 bacteria, two candida species, five dermatophytic fungi and two viruses. significant inhibitory effect was noted against gram positive bacteria. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. citreus, streptococcus pyogenes and sarcina lutea was 1 microgram/ml and against s. faecalis, s. pneumoniae, s. lactis, corynebacterium diphtheriae, c. hofmannii and bacillus subtilis, 5 micrograms/ml. its effect was compared with those of identical concentrations of benzyl penicillin, gentamicin and trimethoprim. the inhibitory effect of julifloricine on gram negative bacteria such as the species of salmonella, shigella, klebsiella, proteus, pseudomonas, enterobacter, aeromonas and vibrio was almost insignificant. julifloricine as compared to micoanzole was found superior against c. tropicalis and responded equally to c. albicans. as compared to econazole, it was found less effective against both c. albicans and c. tropicalis. this alkaloid was found inactive against dermatophytic fungi (up to a dose of 10 micrograms/ml) and viruses which  included herpes simplex 1 and newcastle disease virus. julifloricine up to a doses of 1000 micrograms/25 g of mice was found nonlethal.

TI  == bactericidal activity of lomefloxacin sc 47111 (ny-198) and ciprofloxacin against selected pathogens.
AB  == the bacterial activity of lomefloxacin and ciprofloxacin against selected pathogens was compared using kill-kinetic methods to assess inhibitory (1 x mic)  and suprainhibitory (4 x mic) concentrations. five strains each of the following  microorganisms were studied: streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. we found that lomefloxacin was 8- to 16-fold less active than ciprofloxacin as measured by mics. however, the bactericidal activities of both lomefloxacin and ciprofloxacin were comparable when concentrations 1 x mic and 4 x mic were tested. for many of  the isolates tested, such concentrations would be achieved clinically. the low mics seen for the gram-negative bacilli did not correlate with killing ability for either drug: concentrations 8-16 x mic were needed for 99.9% killing of the final inoculum. although higher concentrations of lomefloxacin are needed for inhibitory and bactericidal activity, the improved pharmacokinetics of lomefloxacin may result in this agent being comparable to ciprofloxacin.

AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == antimicrobial activity of stratum corneum lipids from normal and essential fatty  acid-deficient mice.
AB  == among the cutaneous effects of an essential fatty acid deficient (efad) diet are  hyperdesquamation, increased transepidermal water loss (tewl), and altered lipid  profiles, characteristics also common to inflammatory dermatoses. because fatty acids are antimicrobial, we examined the indigenous skin flora of normal and efad hairless mice, and compared the antimicrobial efficacy of lipids extracted from their stratum corneum. efad mice supported 100-fold more bacteria than normal mice, and were the only group from which staphylococcus aureus were routinely isolated. despite this greater carriage, in vitro experiments demonstrated that efad lipids are more lethal than normal lipids against streptococcus pyogenes, s. aureus, s. epidermidis, micrococcus sp., and a coryneform. skin fungi were equally susceptible to both extracts. after thin layer chromatography, the most active fractions were found to be glycosphingolipids and phospholipids. efad extracts had 35% more free fatty acids and 75% more glycosphingolipids; normal extracts had more triglycerides and phospholipids. s. aureus strain 502a survived equally well on efad as on normal mice. normal lipids applied on efad mice had no additional effect, but efad lipids on normal mice brought about a 35% reduction of the inoculated bacteria. if the mice were pretreated with alcohol, carriage of strain 502a was reduced by 71%. if instead the mice were previously washed with acetone to increase tewl, a 97% reduction of the staphylococcus occurred. the application of normal flora to such acetone-washed mice decreased the efficacy to 76%. efad and normal lipids on human subjects were equally ineffective in eliminating strain 502a.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == mechanisms of bacterial opsonization by immune globulin intravenous: correlation  of complement consumption with opsonic activity and protective efficacy.
AB  == to study the mechanism of bacterial opsonization by immune globulin intravenous (igiv) complement consumption and polymorphonuclear leukocyte (pmnl) membrane receptor (fcrlo, cr1, and cr3)-mediated phagocytosis of staphylococcus epidermidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, and groups a and b streptococci were examined. igiv alone did not consume complement and showed no opsonic activity by itself for these organisms. when these bacteria were preopsonized in igiv, significant amounts of complement were consumed (44%-94%) and the uptake and killing of bacteria occurred. the in vitro opsonic activity of igiv for these organisms was significantly correlated with the amount of complement consumed by  the igiv-opsonized bacteria (r = .85, p less than .05). the in vivo protective efficacy of igiv also appeared to be directly associated with its ability to activate and consume complement (r = 1.0, p less than .001). antibodies to fcrlo  (leu 11) markedly inhibited phagocytosis of bacteria opsonized in igiv but not that of bacteria opsonized in specific igm. both cr1 and cr3 receptors on pmnls were involved in uptake, but the contribution of each is different with different organisms.

TI  == roxithromycin. a review of its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetic properties and clinical efficacy.
AB  == roxithromycin is an acid-stable orally administered antibacterial macrolide structurally related to erythromycin. it has an in vitro antibacterial profile similar to that of erythromycin, with activity against staphylococcus aureus, s.  epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, branhamella catarrhalis, mycoplasma pneumoniae, legionella pneumophila, chlamydia trachomatis, gardnerella vaginalis, haemophilus ducreyi, some anaerobes and other less common pathogens. roxithromycin has a pharmacokinetic profile that is characterised by excellent enteral absorption achieving high concentrations in most tissues and body fluids. the results of clinical studies with roxithromycin have confirmed the potential for its use in a variety of infections, which was suggested by its antibacterial  activity in vitro and pharmacokinetic profile. clinical efficacy has been confirmed in the treatment of respiratory tract infections, including community-acquired and atypical pneumonias, ear, nose and throat infections, genitourinary tract infections, and skin and soft tissue infections. in a relatively small number of patients roxithromycin has generally been shown to be  as effective as erythromycin and other appropriate antibacterial drugs in some of the above indications. roxithromycin is well tolerated and has less potential than erythromycin to produce clinically significant drug interactions. thus, roxithromycin is an orally active drug which should prove a useful alternative when selecting antibacterial therapy for indications where macrolides are appropriate.

AB  == platelet-bacterial interactions were examined in vitro by incubating organisms isolated from patients with septicemia with normal platelet-rich plasma. the potency of various species of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to induce  irreversible platelet aggregation was then determined in an aggregometer. the aggregation curves produced by the bacteria resembled the normal platelet response to collagen and were impeded by the presence of aspirin. strains of staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from 25 different patients produced maximum increases in light transmission and irreversible platelet aggregation with relatively rapid mean aggregation times; six of these patients had clinical and laboratory evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation. in contrast, isolates of alpha streptococcus and staphylococcus epidermidis induced irreversible platelet aggregation much less commonly and were associated with considerably longer mean aggregation times. none of the latter group of patients had evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation. isolates of bacteria from a small number of patients with subacute bacterial endocarditis uniformly induced irreversible platelet aggregation. addition of paired bacterial isolates to normal platelet-rich plasma demonstrated a synergistic aggregation response. these data suggest that a relative hierarchy exists in bacterial strain potency to induce irreversible platelet aggregation. the rapidity and degree of aggregation in vitro correlated well with the clinical and laboratory evidence for subacute bacterial endocarditis and disseminated intravascular coagulation in vivo. these observations may provide useful adjunctive laboratory information to help establish the diagnosis of subacute bacterial endocarditis, especially in the clinical setting where the classical findings of endocarditis are not obvious during initial presentation.

AB  == cell walls isolated from 29 strains of 24 gram-positive bacterial species, whose  peptidoglycans belong to the group a type of schleifer and kandler's classification, with one exception (arthrobacter sp.), were shown to activate the complement cascade in pooled fresh human serum mainly through the alternative pathway and partly through the classical one. the complement-activating effect of cell walls (5 species) possessing group b type peptidoglycan, except those of corynebacterium insidiosum, was weaker than that of the walls with group a type peptidoglycan. preparations of peptidoglycan isolated from cell walls of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and lactobacillus plantarum also activated the alternative pathway of the complement cascade, but less effectively than the respective parent cell walls. a water-soluble "polymer" of peptidoglycan subunits (seps), which was prepared from staphylococcus epidermidis peptidoglycans by treatment with a cross-bridge degrading endopeptidase, retained most of the complement-activating ability of the parent cell walls. a peptidoglycan "monomer," seps-m, which was obtained by hydrolysis of the glycan chain of seps with endo-n-acetylmuramidase to disaccharide units did not activate complement. in conformity with this finding, neither synthetic n-acetylmuramyl-l-alanyl-d-isoglutamine (mdp) nor mdp-l-lys-d-ala activated the complement cascade. among several lipophilic derivatives of mdp, 6-o-(3-hydroxy-3-docosylhexacosanoyl)-mdp-l-lys-d-ala (bh48-mdp-l-lys-d-ala) and  6-o-(2-tetradecylhexadecanoyl)-mdp (b30-mdp) were shown to activate complement through the alternative as well as the classical pathway and exclusively through  the classical pathway, respectively. the finding that a d-isoasparagine analog of b30-mdp caused the same effect as the parent molecule strongly suggests that the  activation of complement by b30-mdp is different from that caused by cell wall peptidoglycans and a water-soluble "polymer" of peptidoglycan subunits.

AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of a-56268 (te-031), the 6-o-methyl derivative of erythromycin, was compared with those of erythromycin and other reference drugs. a-56268 had the same spectrum of antibacterial activity as erythromycin. a-56268 was generally 1 log2 dilution more potent or equal to erythromycin against all organisms except haemophilus influenzae and propionibacterium acnes, for which a-56268 was 1 log2 dilution and 3 log2 dilutions, respectively, less potent. the mbc of a-56268 and erythromycin was not significantly different from the mic against streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis, and h. influenzae but was more than 2 log2 dilutions higher than the mics for some staphylococcus aureus strains. human serum at a concentration of 50% did not change the in vitro potency of a-56268 or erythromycin. a-56268 was similar to erythromycin in being  more active at ph 8.0 than at the physiologic ph of 7.3. the activity of a-56268  was synergistic with sulfamethoxazole against 4 of 12 strains of h. influenzae. in mouse protection tests, when administered orally a-56268 was more potent than  erythromycin against h. influenzae, s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, and s. aureus. after subcutaneous administration the potencies of a-56268 and erythromycin were  not statistically different from each other. a-56268 was more potent than erythromycin against legionella infection in guinea pigs. the concentration of a-56268 in the serum and lung was higher than that of erythromycin after intraperitoneal administration. in a-56268 in the serum and lung was higher than  that of erythromycin after intraperitoneal administration. in mice, the peak levels in serum of a-56268 and erythromycin were similar after subcutaneous administration and seven times higher for a-56268 after oral administration. the  serum half-life of a-56268 was approximately twice that of erythromycin after administration by both routes.

TI  == the value of needle aspiration in the management of cellulitis.
AB  == needle aspirations from 103 young, healthy patients (mean age 22 years) with cellulitis were prospectively analyzed to determine the percentage yield and causative organisms. a standard technique of needle aspiration was performed using a 22-gauge needle, a 10-cc syringe, and 1 cc of sterile water. aspirations  were performed at the leading edge and midpoint of the cellulitis (halfway between the leading edge and the center of the cellulitis). fifteen of the 103 patients (14.5 percent) had positive aspirates. nine of the 103 aspirates were positive at the leading edge (8.7 percent) and 6 of 70 were positive at the midpoint (8.6 percent), giving a total aspiration positivity of 8.7 percent (15/173). the organisms recovered were staphylococcus aureus (53 percent). staphylococcus epidermidis (27 percent), alpha-hemolytic streptococci (13 percent) and streptococcus pyogenes (7 percent). the low-percentage yield and predictable organisms recovered speak against needle aspiration being a necessary procedure in a young, healthy population. similarly, the site of aspiration does  not increase yield. empiric treatment with antibiotics aimed at staphylococcal and streptococcal organisms is appropriate.

TI  == [comparison of in vitro activities of first, second and third generation cephem antibiotics against various pathogens isolated from clinical material in 1985].
AB  == in vitro susceptibilities of 2,133 strains of various pathogens isolated from clinical materials in 1985 to various cephem antibiotics were studied using the showa disk diffusion test. the following antibiotics were evaluated: cephalexin (cex), cephalothin (cet), cefazolin (cez), cefotiam (ctm), cefoxitin (cfx), cefmetazole (cmz), cefotaxime (ctx), cefoperazone (cpz), ceftizoxime (czx), cefmenoxime (cmx), latamoxef (lmox) and cefsulodin (cfs). s. aureus: susceptible  strains to cet, cez, ctm, cfx and cmz with mics less than 15 micrograms/ml accounted for 93, 73, 94, 80 and 96% of the strains tested respectively, while those susceptible to ctx, cpz, czx, cmx, lmox and cfs accounted for 91, 65, 53, 96, 65 and 95%, respectively. susceptible strains to cex at mics less than or equal to 20 micrograms/ml were 52%. prevalence of bacterial resistance to cex and cez, which have been used extensively, was greater than that to cet, ctm or cmz,  showing a bimodal distribution of mics. the third generation cephems studied, in  general, also showed bimodal distributions of mics. s. epidermidis: susceptible strains to cet, cez, ctm, cmz, ctx, cpz and cmx with mics less than 15 micrograms/ml were more than 82% of the strains tested. s. pyogenes: all strains  studied were susceptible to cet, cez, ctm, cfx, cmz, ctx, cpz, czx and cmx at mics less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml. however, susceptible strains to either lmox or cfs accounted for 95%, while those to cex at mics less than or equal to 20 micrograms/ml accounted for 95%.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the in vitro activity of erythromycin against clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and haemophilus influenzae was examined by agar dilution and agar diffusion methods. the plates were incubated in air alone or in 8% co2 and air. the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) measured in air alone were lower for most of the isolates, compared to those found in 8% co2. the greatest differences in mic values were found for h. influenzae; the mic 50% was 0.5 mg/l in air and 4 mg/l in 8% co2. sensitivity testing by the agar diffusion method (ics) showed considerable differences between results obtained in air and in 8% co2; the inhibition zones were generally smaller in co2. the most marked reduction in zone sizes after incubation in 8% co2 was seen with the h. influenzae isolates; 15 out of 43 isolates moved from the "sensitive" to "moderately sensitive" group. sensitivity determination of aerobic bacteria for erythromycin should be performed in air alone in the routine laboratory.

AB  == the in vitro activity of coumermycin has been compared with those of ampicillin,  clindamycin, cloxacillin, doxycycline, erythromycin, netilmicin, penicillin g and vancomycin. a total of 251 clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci were examined. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined by an agar dilution method. clindamycin, coumermycin and erythromycin were the most active drugs against staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis on a weight-for-weight basis. all the staphylococcal isolates were inhibited by coumermycin at a concentration of 0.12 mg/l or less. netilmicin seemed to be somewhat more active  against s. epidermidis than against s. aureus. the mics of vancomycin for the staphylococcal isolates were clustered around 1 mg/l. streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and s. agalactiae were highly susceptible to penicillin g and erythromycin; most isolates were inhibited by 0.03 mg/l or less of either drug. coumermycin showed poor activity against s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae and enterococci. most of the s. pneumoniae isolates had also high mics, although a wide range of sensitivities was found.

TI  == microbicidal activity of octenidine hydrochloride, a new alkanediylbis[pyridine]  germicidal agent.
AB  == the potential of octenidine hydrochloride (win 41464-2) as a topical microbicide  was measured both by in vitro death kinetics and reductions in numbers of bacteria on the skin of cynomolgus monkeys. semilogarithmic survival curves were  plotted to measure the microbicidal activity of various concentrations of octenidine against staphylococcus aureus. the microbicidal activity of octenidine was also determined for staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, and candida albicans. death rates for the same microbial strains were compared with those obtained by using chlorhexidine gluconate. octenidine concentrations of less than 1.5 microm (0.94 microgram/ml)  caused a greater than 99% reduction of each microbial population within 15 min. staphylococcus epidermidis was the most susceptible of the test organisms, and e. coli and c. albicans were the least susceptible. octenidine was more active than  chlorhexidine against each test strain. skin-degerming activities of aqueous and  formulated octenidine and formulated chlorhexidine were compared in single and multiple applications of these agents to the hand and foot surfaces of monkeys by using a glove-juice extraction procedure to measure the skin microflora. aqueous  octenidine, at a concentration of 0.2 to 1.6% reduced resident microflora populations from 90 to 99.98%, depending on the concentration and number of applications. octenidine formulated at 2% in a surfactant-based vehicle exhibited significantly better skin-degerming activity than did either a nonmedicated vehicle or the hibiclens brand of 4% chlorhexidine gluconate.

AB  == three new glycopeptide antibiotics, aridicins a, b, and c, produced by kibdelosporangium aridum have a spectrum of antimicrobial activity in vitro which is similar to that of vancomycin. the antimicrobial activities of these glycopeptides against clinical bacterial isolates were compared with those of vancomycin and other related glycopeptide antibiotics in vitro by agar dilution and microtiter broth dilution tests and in vivo in mouse protection studies. in vitro they were somewhat less effective than vancomycin against strains of staphylococcus aureus and less active against coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. however, they were more active than vancomycin against strains of streptococcus faecalis and markedly superior to vancomycin and other glycopeptide antibiotics against strains of clostridium difficile. in experimental infections, aridicin a was effective against strains of s. aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pyogenes, although its 50% effective doses were higher than those of vancomycin when administered after infection. after subcutaneous administration, aridicin a had a higher peak level in serum and a longer half-life than vancomycin or teicoplanin. the aridicins were markedly superior to vancomycin when administered prior to infection in mouse protection tests, indicating long-acting potential.

TI  == presence of laminin receptors in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == a characteristic feature of infection by staphylococcus aureus is bloodstream invasion and widespread metastatic abscess formation. the ability to extravasate, which entails crossing the vascular basement membrane, appears to be critical for the organism's pathogenicity. extravasation by normal and neoplastic mammalian cells has been correlated with the presence of specific cell surface receptors for the basement membrane glycoprotein laminin. similar laminin receptors were found in staphylococcus aureus but not in staphylococcus epidermidis, a noninvasive pathogen. there were about 100 binding sites per cell, with an apparent binding affinity of 2.9 nanomolar. the molecular weight of the receptor  was 50,000 and pi was 4.2. eukaryotic laminin receptors were visualized by means  of the binding of s. aureus in the presence of laminin. prokaryotic and eukaryotic invasive cells might utilize similar, if not identical, mechanisms for invasion.

TI  == mode of action and in-vitro activity of vancomycin.
AB  == vancomycin is a unique glycopeptide structurally unrelated to any currently available antibiotic. it also has a unique mode of action inhibiting the second stage of cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. there is also evidence that vancomycin alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits  ribonucleic acid synthesis. induction of bacterial l-phase variants from susceptible organisms with vancomycin is extremely difficult, and such variants are unstable. stable l-phase variants induced by other agents are susceptible to  vancomycin. vancomycin is active against a large number of species of gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), staph. epidermidis (including multiple-resistant  strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiple-resistant strains), str. pyogenes, str. agalactiae, str. bovis, str. mutans, viridans streptococci, enterococci, clostridium species, diphtheroids, listeria monocytogenes, actinomyces species and lactobacillus species. there has been no increase in resistance to vancomycin during the past three decades. enhancement of antimicrobial activity has been demonstrated with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against staph. aureus, str. bovis, enterococci and viridans streptococci. the combination of vancomycin and rifampicin are antagonistic to most strains of staph. aureus, though indifference and occasionally synergism have been shown, but is synergistic against strains of staph. epidermidis. it shows indifference against enterococci. vancomycin and fusidic acid are indifferent against staph. aureus.

[3h]thymidine incorporation into bacterial, but not fibroblast, dna was efficiently and promptly inhibited by the antimicrobial polypeptide preparation. this suggests that its main target is a component of the system, which catalyzes and regulates the biosynthesis of bacterial dna.

TI  == evaluation of rapid identification of gram-positive cocci in positive blood cultures by use of the automicrobic system gram-positive identification card.

AB  == the alpha-hemolytic streptococcus mitis strain no. 17-1, isolated from the oral cavity of an healthy female adult, antagonized the growth of all 24 test strains  of serratia marcescens examined; furthermore, this strain inhibited the growth of various strains of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, listeria monocytogenes, and corynebacterium diphtheriae. however, strans of escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa proved refractory. the mechanism of microbial antagonism was due to production and release of hydrogen peroxide under aerobic atmospheric conditions, which was neutralized through incorporation of bovine liver catalase into the solid assay medium.

TI  == teichomycin: in-vitro and in-vivo evaluation in comparison with other antibiotics.
AB  == teichomycin, a new glycopeptide antibiotic with a spectrum of activity similar to that of vancomycin, was highly active against staphylococci, streptococci and gram-positive anaerobes (propionibacterium acnes, clostridium perfringens and cl. difficile). ninety per cent of the staphylococcus aureus and streptococcal strains, including enterococci, were inhibited by 0.4 mg/l; 90% of staph. epidermidis strains were susceptible to 1.6 mg/l. vancomycin was less active than teichomycin against all clinical isolates tested. multiply resistant strains, including methicillin-resistant staph. aureus, were all susceptible to teichomycin and vancomycin. teichomycin was highly bactericidal for growing cells of staphylococci and streptococcus pyogenes and moderately bactericidal for str.  faecalis. in mice, teichomycin was well absorbed upon subcutaneous administration and had a half-life of 2.5 h. it was very effective in curing experimental mouse  septicemias caused by gram-positive bacteria (ed50 values less than 1 mg/kg).

TI  == a controlled trial of cefaclor versus amoxicillin for treatment of acute otitis media in early infancy.
AB  == optimal antimicrobial therapy of acute otitis media with effusion in early infancy is controversial. we studied the efficacy of cefaclor and amoxicillin in  the treatment of 40 nonconsecutive infants less than 3 months of age in a double  blind comparative trial. infants were randomly assigned to receive either oral amoxicillin or cefaclor in a dosage of 40 mg/kg/day divided into 3 doses for 10 days. clinical responses and adverse drug effects were evaluated at 48 to 72 hours, 5 to 7 days, 2 weeks and 3 weeks. pathogenic bacteria isolated from ear aspirates in 24 cases included streptococcus pneumoniae (14), haemophilus influenzae type b (5), h. influenzae nontypeable (3), staphylococcus aureus (4),  branhamella sp. (2), and streptococcus pyogenes (1). nonpathogenic bacteria isolated in 14 cases included streptococcus epidermidis, diphtheroids and streptococcus viridans. two aspirates were sterile. a satisfactory clinical response was achieved in 15 of 21 cases (71%) treated with amoxicillin and 14 of  19 cases (74%) treated with cefaclor. we conclude that amoxicillin and cefaclor are comparable in efficacy for the therapy of acute otitis media with effusion in early infancy.

AB  == thirty-four infants and children ranging in age from 2.5 to 180 months (mean, 40  months) were treated with parenteral moxalactam (150 mg/kg per day) for suspected or proved bacterial infections outside the central nervous system. six patients infected with haemophilus influenzae b, nine infected with staphylococcus aureus, three infected with streptococcus pneumoniae, one infected with streptococcus pyogenes, one infected with enterobacter aerogenes, one infected with fusobacterium nucleotum, and one infected with staphylococcus epidermidis, microaerophilic streptococcus, and propionibacterium sp. were clinically and bacteriologically cured. one patient with polymicrobial pansinusitis did not respond to moxalactam. no patients developed meningitis. all of the isolates tested were inhibited by less than or equal to 5 micrograms of moxalactam per ml, except for one staphylococcus epidermidis isolate which was resistant to greater  than 20 micrograms/ml. five patients had transient neutropenia which resolved after the drug was discontinued. the mean peak serum level was 106 micrograms/ml  at 15 min after a 50-mg/kg dose. the mean elimination half-life was 91.2 min. these data indicate that this dosage of moxalactam is a safe and effective treatment for bacterial infections outside the central nervous system.

TI  == studies on bacterial hypersensitivity in man. interrelationship between skin reactions to bacterial peptidoglycan and serum peptidoglycan antibody titers.
AB  == the nature and extent of bacterially induced allergies are difficult to define. since peptidoglycan, the main component of the cell wall of almost all bacteria,  has been available in a highly purified, chemically and immunologically well-defined form, investigation of the allergological significance of this cell  component is feasible. intracutaneous tests were carried out on 181 test subjects with five different peptidoglycan (pg) preparations from staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus pyogenes. the results of the investigation were compared with the result of determination of serum pg antibodies and serum ige concentrations. it was shown that test subjects with dual and later reactions to three different staphylococcal pgs displayed significantly higher pg antibody titers than test subjects with negative reactions. such a relationship could not be found with the cutaneous reactions to streptococcal pg. the total serum ige values were very much higher in test subjects with immediate reactions to staphylococcal pg than in test subjects with a negative reaction. typical arthus reaction or late granulomatous reactions were not observed. humoral antibodies are involved at least in part in the elicitation of dual and late reactions. thus, there are interesting parallels to allergy to fungal spores and organic dusts.

TI  == blood culture cross contamination associated with a radiometric analyzer.
AB  == during a 9-day period in august 1980 in a new jersey hospital, three pairs of consecutively numbered blood cultures from different patients were identified as  positive for the same organism (two pairs of klebsiella pneumoniae and one pair of group a streptococcus), for each pair, both cultures were positive in the same atmosphere, both organisms had the same sensitivities, and the second of each pair grew at least 2 days after the first and was the only positive blood culture obtained from the patient. when the hospital laboratory discontinued use of its radiometric culture analyzer for 15 days, no more consecutive pairs of positive cultures occurred. subsequent use of the machine for 9 days with a new power unit but the original circuit boards resulted in one more similar consecutive pair (staphylococcus epidermidis). after replacement of the entire power unit, there were no further such pairs. examination of the machine by the manufacturer revealed a defective circuit board which resulted in inadequate needle sterilization. laboratories which utilize radiometric analyzers should be aware of the potential for cross contamination. recognition of such events requires alert microbiologists and infection control practitioners and a record system in  the bacteriology laboratory designed to identify such clusters.

TI  == contractile effects of bacterial cell walls, their enzymatic digests, and muramyl dipeptides on ileal strips from guinea pigs.
AB  == cell walls isolated from four bacterial species (streptococcus pyogenes, lactobacillus plantarum, streptomyces gardneri, and nocardia corynebacteriodes),  which exhibited the adjuvant effect of stimulating cellular and humoral immune responses against ovalbumin in guinea pigs, caused the slow-starting and long-lasting contraction of guinea pig ileal strips suspended in tyrode solution. in contrast to these cell walls active in immunoadjuvancy, those isolated from five bacterial species (micrococcus lysodeikticus, staphylococcus epidermidis, arthrobacter atrocyaneus, corynebacterium insidiosum, and ampullariella regularis), which lacked immunoadjuvancy at least in intact walls, caused no or very weak contraction of the ileal strips. further study demonstrated that both a monomer and a polymer of disaccharide-stem peptides, which were obtained by enzymatic degradation of s. epidermis cell wall peptidoglycans, displayed similar contractile effects. it was finally revealed that guinea pig ileum strips showed  a definite contractile response to n-acetylmuramyl-l-alanyl-d-isoglutamine (mdp)  and 6-o-stearoyl- and 6-o-(2-tetradecylhexadecanoyl)-mdps, but not to their analogs, whose c-terminal amino acid was l-isoglutamine or d-isoasparagine in place of d-isoglutamine and which lacked adjuvancy. 6-o-(3-hydroxy-2-docosylhexacosanoyl)-mdp, on the other hand, caused a slow and lasting relaxation of the ileum strips, but its l-isoglutamine and d-isoasparagine analogs did not.

TI  == the antibacterial action of vancomycin.
AB  == vancomycin inhibits the second stage of cell wall synthesis in susceptible bacteria. furthermore, there is evidence that vancomycin also alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits ribonucleic acid synthesis. stable l-phase variants are susceptible to vancomycin, but induction of bacterial l-phase variants with vancomycin is very difficult. vancomycin is active against a large number of species of gram-positive cocci and bacilli, such as staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (including multiply resistant strains). streptococcus  pneumoniae (including multiply resistant strains), streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus bovis, viridans group streptococcus, enterococcus, clostridium species, diphtheroids, listeria monocytogenes, actinomyces species, and lactobacillus species. antimicrobial activity can be enhanced with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against s. aureus, s. bovis, enterococcus, and viridans streptococcus. the combination of vancomycin and rifampin also has enhanced activity against s. aureus.

TI  == mannitol agar for microbiologic diagnosis of bovine mastitis.
AB  == a medium containing mannitol (mannitol agar) was developed and evaluated as a tool for the microbiologic diagnosis of bovine mastitis. mannitol agar supported  growth of all important bacterial mastitis pathogens (staphylococci, streptococci, coliforms, and pseudomonads) except corynebacterium pyogenes. color change around colonies in the agar permitted the differentiation of pathogenic from nonpathogenic staphylococci. most staphylococcus aureus strains and some staphylococcus epidermidis strains produced yellow zones. these yellow zone-producing strains (mannitol fermenters) of staphylococci were obtained from  quarters with significantly elevated (p less than 0.05) somatic cell counts (scc) in the milk, as compared with uninfected quarters and, therefore, would be considered pathogens. mannitol-negative strains of s epidermidis (those with red  zones) were obtained from quarters with scc similar to those of uninfected quarters. the streptococci could be divided into 2 groups on the basis of color change around the colonies: streptococcus agalactiae, str dysgalactiae, and group g streptococci produced red zones; str uberis, str bovis, and enterococci produced yellow zones. pathogenic streptococci (str agalactiae, str dysgalactiae, str uberis, and group g streptococci) were obtained from quarters with scc significantly higher (p less than 0.01) than those of uninfected quarters. streptococcus bovis and enterococci were obtained from quarters with scc similar  to those of uninfected quarters and were considered nonpathogenic. pathogenic streptococci were found in much higher concentration than nonpathogenic streptococci and could be differentiated on that basis.

AB  == new qualitative and quantitative methods are described for the investigation of the antibacterial activity of lipids on solid media by the application of lipid-impregnated filter paper over a lawn of the organisms. the methods have been used to investigate the antibacterial activity of unsaturated fatty acids that are important in skin defence. oleic and linoleic acids inhibited streptococcus pyogenes markedly, staphylococcus aureus and staph epidermidis to a lesser extent and had no effect on escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the inhibition of growth of a strain of str. pyogenes from a sore throat was greater than that of a strain from an outbreak of impetigo. linoleic acid was a more potent inhibitor of bacterial growth than oleic acid, and with both acids inhibition was more pronounced under aerobic than under anaerobic conditions of incubation. the methods described could be applied in other fields such as pharmacology, horticulture and industry.

TI  == specific absorption of human serum albumin, immunoglobulin a, and immunoglobulin  g with selected strains of group a and g streptococci.

TI  == adjuvant activities in production of reaginic antibody by bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan or synthetic n-acetylmuramyl dipeptides in mice.

TI  == secretion of lipids induced by inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis in streptococci.
AB  == inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis causes an immediate and massive secretion of both newly synthesized and "old" lipids from several species of bacteria, including streptococci, staphylococcus epidermidis, and bacillus subtilis. lipid  secretion occurs in the absence of detectable bacterial lysis. this novel phenomenon was examined in more detail in three strains of streptococci: s. sanguis (group h), s. pyogenes (group a), and s. pneumoniae. the secretion of lipids is specifically induced by inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis; it is not caused by inhibitors of protein, ribonucleic acid, or deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis. the occurrence appears to be reversible since penicillin-induced secretion comes to a halt upon the timely addition of penicillinase, correlating  with resumption of culture growth. all cellular lipids are secreted in essentially the same proportions as those found in the drug treated bacteria. it  is suggested that continued peptidoglycan synthesis may be essential for the integration and retention of lipid material in the plasma membrane.

AB  == peptidoglycan is responsible for the endotoxin-like properties of the streptococcus cell wall. the pyrogenic response of rabbit to group a streptococcus peptidoglycan prepared by hot formamide or tca is dose-dependent and is increased if the material is ultrasonically solubilized. the pyrogenicity  can be eliminated by the antiserum to the peptidoglycan or by the degradation of  the material by lysozyme. peptidoglycans prepared from cell walls of group b and  l streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus pneumoniae produce fever effects comparable to the response after group a streptococcus peptidoglycan. spirillum serpens and escherichia coli contain in addition to endotoxin the peptidoglycan which is also pyrogenic. repeated injections of bacterial peptidoglycan to rabbit result in tolerance to the fever effect. cross-tolerance was recorded only exceptionally. rabbits tolerant to endotoxin respond with a lower fever to s. aureus and group a streptococcus peptidoglycans. intravenous administration of peptidoglycan to rabbit causes extensive alterations in the heart characterized by various stages  of the degenerative and necrotic process. local shwartzman reaction can be elicited in rabbit by peptidoglycan used either as a preparative or as a provocative dose in combination with endotoxin, or it can be used for both doses. the results obtained with peptidoglycans prepared from various bacteria are fully comparable. non-specific resistance of mice to infection induced by streptococcus cell walls was found to be dependent on the peptidoglycan activity; cell wall proteins and polysaccharide are inactive. these properties of peptidoglycan resemble those known from endotoxin studies. the data presented suggest the role  of peptidoglycan in pathological reactions resulting from host-parasite interaction.

TI  == agar medium for the selective enumeration of coagulase-positive staphylococcus from the rat alimentary tract.
AB  == a selective agar medium (medium j(1)) is proposed for the quantitative enumeration of egg yolk-positive (eyp) and egg yolk-negative (eyn) staphylococcus pyogenes from the digestive tract and feces of the rat. this medium, buffered at  ph 5.0, is composed of acid casein hydrolysate and yeast extract with 7.5% sodium chloride, 1.6% sodium pyruvate, 0.0008% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (ttc), and 6% egg yolk emulsion. inoculation is by the pour-plate method and incubation is at 38 c in a water-jacketed incubator for 36 hr. colonies of s. pyogenes reduce ttc; eyp strains are surrounded by a halo of opacity; and eyn strains may be surrounded by a red halo, but no opacity. small, white colonies of s. epidermidis may develop, but micrococcus, and all other groups of staphylococcus recognized in the rat intestinal flora, are inhibited. other bacterial genera, notably bacillus, corynebacterium, proteus, and streptococcus,  are also inhibited.
