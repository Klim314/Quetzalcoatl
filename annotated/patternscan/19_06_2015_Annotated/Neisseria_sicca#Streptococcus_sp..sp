TI  == subgingival microbiome in smokers and non-smokers in korean chronic periodontitis patients.
AB  == smoking is a major environmental factor associated with periodontal diseases. however, we still have a very limited understanding of the relationship between smoking and subgingival microflora in the global population. here, we investigated the composition of subgingival bacterial communities from the pooled plaque samples of smokers and non-smokers, 134 samples in each group, in korean patients with moderate chronic periodontitis using 16s rrna gene-based pyrosequencing. a total of 17,927 reads were analyzed and classified into 12 phyla, 126 genera, and 394 species. differences in bacterial communities between  smokers and non-smokers were examined at all phylogenetic levels. the genera fusobacterium, fretibacterium, streptococcus, veillonella, corynebacterium, tm7,  and filifactor were abundant in smokers. on the other hand, prevotella, campylobacter, aggregatibacter, veillonellaceae gq422718, haemophilus, and prevotellaceae were less abundant in smokers. among species-level taxa occupying  > 1% of whole subgingival microbiome of smokers, higher abundance (>/= 2.0-fold compared to non-smokers) of seven species or operational taxonomic units (otus) was found: fusobacterium nucleatum, neisseria sicca, neisseria oralis, corynebacterium matruchotii, veillonella dispar, filifactor alocis, and fretibacterium ay349371. on the other hand, lower abundance of 11 species or otus was found in smokers: neisseria elongata, six prevotella species or otus, fusobacterium canifelinum, aggregatibacter am420165, selenomonas otu, and veillonellaceae gu470897. species richness and evenness were similar between the  groups whereas diversity was greater in smokers than non-smokers. collectively, the results of the present study indicate that differences exist in the subgingival bacterial community between smoker and non-smoker patients with chronic moderate periodontitis in korea, suggesting that cigarette smoking considerably affects subgingival bacterial ecology.

TI  == polymicrobial endocarditis in intravenous heroin and fentanyl abuse.
AB  == infective endocarditis is a life threatening condition with a high mortality rate. intravenous drug abusers (ivda) are more likely to acquire endocarditis. most of the cases of infective endocarditis are caused by a single pathogen; cases of polymicrobial endocarditis are rare and they are associated with a reported mortality rate of more than 30%. only 21 cases of n. sicca endocarditis  have been described in the literature since 1918, and only 15 reported cases of endocarditis which involved actinomyces species have been reported since 1939. we are reporting a case of a 49-year-old male with intravenous heroin and fentanyl abuse, who presented with infective endocarditis caused by neisseria sicca/subflava(n. sicca), actinomyces, streptococcus mitis, and haemophilus parainfluenzae, complicated by septic emboli to the lungs and skin, ards , splenic infarct and immunocomplex mediated proliferative glomerulonephritis.

TI  == radiography-based score indicative for the pathogenicity of bacteria in odontogenic infections.
AB  == objective: to develop a new radiography-based score to assess the potential of bacteria to cause odontogenic infections derived from the occurrence of bacteria  at small or large radiographical lesions. materials and methods: the patients analyzed were a sub-population from a large randomized clinical trial comparing moxifloxacin and clindamycin in the treatment of inflammatory infiltrates and odontogenic abscesses. routine radiographs were used to analyze the area of the periapical radiolucent lesions. lesions were stratified by their radiographically measured area as large (>9 mm(2)) or small (</=9 mm(2)). a risk ratio was calculated for each species from the frequency of their occurrence in large vs in small lesions. results: fifty-one patients, 19 with abscesses and 32 with infiltrates, were evaluated. overall, the radiographical lesion areas ranged from 0.4-46.2 mm(2) (median = 9 mm(2)). an increased risk (risk ratio >1) to occur at  large abscess lesions was observed for prevotella (p.) oralis, p. buccae, p. oris, p. intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum and streptococcus (strep.) anginosus group. an increased risk to occur at large infiltrate lesions was found for strep. salivarius, strep. parasanguis, strep. anginosus group, capnocytophaga spp., neisseria (n.) sicca, neisseria spp., staphylococcus (staph.) aureus, p. intermedia, p. buccae, prevotella spp. and p. melaninogenica. conclusions: the radiography-based score suggests that certain prevotella spp., f. nucleatum and strep. anginosus groups play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of odontogenic abscesses, and that various streptococci, neisseria spp., capnocytophaga spp., staph. aureus and prevotella spp. are involved in the pathogenesis of odontogenic infiltrates.

TI  == [protease activity of microflora in the oral cavity of patients with periodontitis].
AB  == microbial spectrum and non-specific as well as specific iga1 protease activity of isolated microorganisms were investigated in gingival liquid of patients with periodontitis. microorganisms from the gingival liqud of these patients belonged  to conditional-pathogenic obligate and facultatively anaerobic bacteria. 24 strains of microorganisms have been identified. nonspecific proteolytic activity  was found in the following microorganisms: actinomyces israelii, actinomyces naeslundii, aerococcus viridans, bifidobacterium longum, neisseria subflave, streptococcus parvulus, eubacterium alactolyticum, lactobaccilus catenoforme, bacillus spp. specific iga1-protease activity and lack of proteolytic activity towards igg was found in streptococcus acidominimus, streptococcus hansenii, streptococcus salivarius, leptotrychia buccalis, staphylococcus haemolyticus and  neisseria sicca. no proteolytic activity was found in cultivation medium of eubacterium alactolyticum (1 strain), prevotella buccalis, aerococcus viridans and streptococcus sanguis.

TI  == decontamination effects of low-temperature plasma generated by corona discharge.  part ii: new insights.
AB  == the second part of our paper presents the results of experiments with the decontamination of surfaces by low-temperature plasma generated by corona discharge in air at atmospheric pressure. a simple device is described and the effects of the corona discharge on model microorganisms, viz. the yeast candida albicans, gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, neisseria sicca, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, gram-positive bacteria deinococcus radiodurans, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus sanguinis, and vegetative and spore forms of geobacillus stearothermophilus are discussed. a similar microbicidal effect after about one-minute exposure was observed in all vegetative forms of the microorganisms. measurement in growth inhibition zones on a semisolid medium was used to determine the dependence of the microbicidal effect on exposure time and the distance between electrodes. counting of colonies served to assess the microbicidal effect of the discharge on contaminated inert surfaces observable after more than 1 min exposure. geobacillus stearothermophilus spores were found to have several times lower susceptibility to the action of the discharge and the microbicidal effect was observed only after an 8 min exposure. reaction with the iodide reagent did not unambiguously demonstrate the difference between ozone and singlet oxygen as presumed active components of the corona. the area distribution of reactive oxygen species was determined; it was found to differ from the wartburg law depending on exposure time. qualitative evidence was obtained on the penetration  of the reactive oxygen species into the semisolid medium.

TI  == innate immune responses of human neonatal cells to bacteria from the normal gastrointestinal flora.
AB  == the hygiene hypothesis postulates that the prevalence of allergy has increased due to decreased microbial stimulation early in life, leading to delayed maturation of the immune system. the aim of this study was to examine the cytokine pattern produced from cord blood mononuclear cells relative to adult cells after stimulation with bacterial strains from the normal flora. mononuclear cells from cord and adult blood samples were stimulated with the following bacteria: bifidobacterium adolescentis, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus mitis, corynebacterium minutissimum, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides vulgatus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, veillonella parvula, and neisseria sicca. the levels of interleukin 12 (il-12), tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), il-10, and il-6 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the tnf-alpha production was also analyzed after blocking cd14, toll-like receptor 2 (tlr-2), and tlr-4 prior to stimulation with bacteria. the levels of il-12 and tnf-alpha were similar in cord and adult cells. gram-positive bacteria induced considerably higher levels of il-12 and tnf-alpha than gram-negative bacteria in both cord and adult cells. the levels of il-6 were significantly higher in newborns than in adults, whereas the levels of  il-10 were similar in newborns and adults. gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria induced similar levels of il-6 and il-10 in cord cells. l. plantarum bound or signaled through cd14, tlr-2, and tlr-4, whereas e. coli acted mainly through cd14 and tlr-4. these results indicate that the innate immune response in newborns to commensal bacteria is strong and also suggest that different bacterial strains may have differential effects on the maturation of the immune system of infants.

TI  == mosaic-like structure of penicillin-binding protein 2 gene (pena) in clinical isolates of neisseria gonorrhoeae with reduced susceptibility to cefixime.
AB  == neisseria gonorrhoeae strains with reduced susceptibility to cefixime (mics, 0.25 to 0.5 micro g/ml) were isolated from male urethritis patients in tokyo, japan, in 2000 and 2001. the resistance to cephems including cefixime and penicillin was transferred to a susceptible recipient, n. gonorrhoeae atcc 19424, by transformation of the penicillin-binding protein 2 gene (pena) that had been amplified by pcr from a strain with reduced susceptibility to cefixime (mic, 0.5  micro g/ml). the sequences of pena in the strains with reduced susceptibilities to cefixime were different from those of other susceptible isolates and did not correspond to the reported n. gonorrhoeae pena gene sequences. some regions in the transpeptidase-encoding domain in this pena gene were similar to those in the pena genes of neisseria perflava (n. sicca), neisseria cinerea, neisseria flavescens, and neisseria meningitidis. these results showed that a mosaic-like structure in the pena gene conferred reductions in the levels of susceptibility of n. gonorrhoeae to cephems and penicillin in a manner similar to that found for n. meningitidis and streptococcus pneumoniae.

TI  == [utility of prolonged incubation and terminal subcultures of blood cultures from  immunocompromised patients].
AB  == the value of blind terminal subcultures (7 and 30 days) and prolonged incubation  (30 days) of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients was analyzed in the fundacion favaloro, the fundacion para la lucha contra las enfermedades neurologicas de la infancia and the hospital de ninos ricardo gutierrez. a total  of 2707 blood cultures and 369 patients were included (transplantation of solid organs 154, oncohematologic disorders 106 and solid tumors 109). bact-alert bottles were incubated at 35 degrees c for 30 days in the bact-alert system. bottles with positive signals were routinely removed, and aliquots of the broth were gram stained and subcultured aerobically in chocolate agar and sabouraud agar. a total of 136 bacteremic episodes were obtained. the positivization time of blood cultures was 81.6% at 24 h, 93.3% at 48 h, 94.5% at 72 h and 97.7% within 7 days. only 3 (2.2%) episodes were positive by blind terminal subcultures and 1 (0.75%) by prolonged incubation (14 days). the median time and range of positivization in hours were 13.8 and 2.2-168, respectively. the microorganisms isolated were coagulase negative staphylococci (n = 24), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 22), staphylococcus aureus (n = 21), escherichia coli (n = 18), acinetobacter spp (n = 9), candida spp (n = 8), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 6), enterobacter cloacae (n = 5), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 5), enterococcus faecalis, salmonella spp and capnocytophaga sputigena (n = 2), enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecium, citrobacter diversus, candida albicans, klebsiella oxytoca, chryseomonas luteola, serratia marcescens, abiotrophia spp, campylobacter jejuni, moraxella catarrhalis, moraxella urethralis, neisseria sicca, beta hemolytic group g streptococci, rhodococcus equi, micrococcus spp, cryptococcus neoformans  and streptococcus mitis (n = 1). in our experience, blind terminal subcultures and prolonged incubation of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients are unnecessary and cost expensive.

TI  == selective sensitization of bacteria to peroxide damage associated with fluoride inhibition of catalase and pseudocatalase.
AB  == fluoride and sulfide are known inhibitors of heme catalases in acid environments. staphylococcus aureus h cells were found to be sensitized by fluoride or sulfide  to h2o2 killing at acid ph values in the range of 3.5 to 4.0, and catalase activity was reduced concomitantly. in contrast, fluoride had little effect on h2o2 killing of streptococcus mutans gs-5, which has fluoride-insensitive peroxidase activity, but still is more sensitive to h2o2 than is s. aureus in the absence of fluoride. fluoride but not sulfide was inhibitory also for the mn-containing, non-heme pseudocatalase of lactobacillus plantarum atcc 14431 over a wide ph range, and this inhibitory effect was reflected in enhanced h2o2 killing in the presence of fluoride. in addition, we found that catalase-positive s. aureus or neisseria sicca could protect catalase-negative s. mutans against killing by h2o2 in mixed suspensions, but protection was compromised by fluoride  or sulfide under acid conditions. thus, catalase-positive organisms could protect a catalase-negative organism against peroxide damage, but inhibition of catalase  reduced protection. these findings are pertinent to the widespread use of fluoride and peroxide in oral health care products.

TI  == identification of the conjugative mef gene in clinical acinetobacter junii and neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates.
AB  == the mef gene, originally described for gram-positive organisms and coding for an  efflux pump, has been identified in clinical isolates of acinetobacter junii and  neisseria gonorrhoeae. these strains could transfer the mef gene at frequencies ranging from 10(-6) to 10(-9) into one or more of the following recipients: gram-negative moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria perflava/sicca and neisseria mucosa and gram-positive enterococcus faecalis. three streptococcus pneumoniae strains could transfer the mef gene into eikenella corrodens, haemophilus influenzae, kingella denitrificans, m. catarrhalis, neisseria meningitidis, n. perflava/sicca, and n. mucosa at similar frequencies. the mef gene can thus be transferred to and expressed in a variety of gram-negative recipients.

TI  == ciprofloxacin versus cefuroxime axetil in the treatment of adult patients with acute bacterial sinusitis.
AB  == objective: this study compared the use and efficacy of ciprofloxacin to cefuroxime axetil for adult patients with acute bacterial sinusitis. method: we conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind pilot study of oral ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice daily) versus cefuroxime axetil (250 mg twice daily)  for 2 to 3 weeks in the treatment of adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of  acute bacterial maxillary sinus infections or acute exacerbation of chronic bacterial sinusitis. patients with microbiologically and radiologically confirmed sinusitis infection composed the efficacy population. results: of the 83 patients enrolled, 13 of 42 (31%) ciprofloxacin- and 19 of 41 (46%) cefuroxime axetil-treated patients had a respiratory pathogen isolated from a sinus aspiration. the most frequent pretherapy isolated included haemophilus influenzae (11), streptococcus species (20), staphylococcus species (7), proteus mirabilis (3), and neisseria sicca (3). at the end of therapy, clinical resolution or improvement in efficacy-valid patients was achieved in 12 (100%) ciprofloxacin-treated patients and in 14 (74%) cefuroxime axetil recipients. the  five (26%) cefuroxime axetil clinical failures were due to development of superinfection. bacteriologic eradication occurred in 12 (100%) and 14 (100%) ciprofloxacin and cefuroxime axetil patients, respectively. similar clinical and  bacteriologic response rates were observed at the 2- to 4-week follow-up. among 83 intent-to-treat patients, 19 (45%) ciprofloxacin and 14 (34%) cefuroxime axetil patients had drug-related adverse events. the most common adverse event in both treatment groups was gastrointestinal. conclusion: this pilot study suggests that ciprofloxacin is efficacious in the management of acute bacterial sinusitis.

TI  == bacteria in human mouths involved in the production and utilization of hydrogen peroxide.
AB  == earlier studies have demonstrated that pure cultures of oral streptococci produce hydrogen peroxide but none has found any free peroxide in dental plaque or salivary sediment despite streptococci being major components of their mixed bacterial populations. the absence of peroxide in plaque and sediment could be due to the dominance of its destruction over its formation by bacterial constituents. to identify which of the oral bacteria might be involved in such a  possibility, pure cultures of 27 different oral bacteria were surveyed (as well as dental plaque and sediment) for their peroxide-forming and peroxide-removing capabilities. peroxide production was measured for each of the pure cultures by incubation with glucose at low and high substrate concentrations (2.8 and 28.0 mm) for 4 h and with the ph kept at 7.0 by a ph-stat. removal of hydrogen peroxide was assessed in similar experiments where peroxide at 0, 29.4, 147.2 or  294.4 mm [0, 0.1, 0.5 and 1% (w/v)] replaced the glucose. hydrogen peroxide formation was seen with only three of the bacteria tested, streptococcus sanguis  i and ii (sanguis and oralis), and strep. mitior (mitis biotype i); levels of hydrogen peroxide between 2.2 and 9.8 mm were produced when these micro-organisms were grown aerobically and 1.1 and 3.9 mm when grown anaerobically. earlier reports indicate that such levels were usually sufficient to inhibit the growth of many plaque bacteria. the amounts formed were similar at the two glucose levels tested, suggesting that maximum peroxide production is reached at low glucose concentration. none of the three peroxide-producing organisms was able to utilize hydrogen peroxide but five of the other 24 tested, neisseria sicca, haemophilus segnis, h. parainfluenzae, actinomyces viscosus and staphylococcus epidermidis, could readily do so, as could the mixed bacteria in salivary sediment and dental plaque, both of which contain relatively high numbers of these peroxide-utilizing micro-organisms. the ability of the bacteria in plaque and sediment to degrade hydrogen peroxide was considerable and extremely rapid; peroxide removal and usually complete within the first 15 min of the incubation even when its initial level was as high as 294.4 mm. this almost overwhelming ability to remove peroxide was confirmed when peroxide-producing and -using cultures were mixed and when each of eight salivary sediments was incubated with  glucose and with peroxide at concentrations up to 294.4 mm. in the glucose incubations, no hydrogen peroxide was observed, indicating dominance of microbial peroxide removers over hydrogen peroxide producers.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == bacterial arthritis.
AB  == in this review of the 1990 septic arthritis literature, we revisit synovial fluid leukocytosis, examine the utility of synovial fluid glucose and protein measurements, and look at the levels of two cytokines, tumor necrosis factor and  interleukin-1, in infected joint fluids. we see the many faces of gonococcal arthritis and the ravages of septic arthritis when the host has rheumatoid arthritis. should we recommend antibiotic prophylaxis for the rheumatoid patient  with a prosthetic joint who is undergoing a procedure that leads to transient bacteremia? what are some of the salient features of septic arthritis when it involves the sternoclavicular or sacroiliac joints? we also look at some unusual  microorganisms, eg, group c streptococcus, streptococcus viridans, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas cepacia, pseudomonas maltophilia, and neisseria sicca. in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, we encounter reports of septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, and spinal epidural abscess caused by opportunistic microorganisms. two unusual sites of infection include the c1-2 lateral facet joint and subacromial bursa without involvement of the glenohumeral joint. finally, we examine how to drain a septic knee: the orthopedic point of view.

TI  == nonsporulating bacterial species contain dna sequences homologous to the bacillus spore-specific c-protein gene.
AB  == genes for small, acid-soluble spore proteins (sasps) are ubiquitous among the spore-forming bacteria and are expressed only during sporulation. although they perform the function of amino acid storage in spores, the members of the sasp-c multigene family probably serve additional functions, so that similar sequences might be present in non-spore-formers. using the sasp-c gene (ssp-c) as a hybridization probe, restriction digests of whole genomic dna from seven nonsporulating bacterial species were examined for similar sequences. hybridization was found in four species: streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, neisseria sicca, and mycobacterium phlei, indicating the presence of similar sequences in some, but not all, of the non-spore-formers. in each of these positive species, multiple bands hybridized. a 4.5-kb hybridizing fragment  from s. pyogenes and a 9.0-kb hybridizing fragment from m. phlei have been cloned and partially sequenced. these fragments show substantial dna sequence homology to ssp-c and their deduced amino acid sequences show substantial homology to sasp-c.

TI  == expression of carbonic anhydrase in neisseriae and other heterotrophic bacteria.
AB  == a diverse range of heterotrophic bacteria was screened for the presence of carbonic anhydrase (ca) activity, sensitivity to inhibition of growth by acetazolamide (ca inhibitor), and the presence of protein binding monospecific antibody prepared against purified neisseria sicca ca. ca activity was demonstrated only in strains of n. sicca and n. gonorrhoeae. however, all neisseria strains, including various isolates of n. meningitidis and n. lactamica, were sensitive to acetazolamide, when grown in air, and showed serological cross-reaction with n. sicca ca. strains of other genera were resistant to acetazolamide. a number of strains including members of the genera pseudomonas, staphylococcus, streptococcus, serratia and proteus also strongly expressed a gene product(s) immunologically related to ca. the presence of ca cross-reacting proteins, which lack hydrase activity, is discussed in relation to the function of the various mammalian ca isoenzymes.

AB  == the adhesion to fibrin-platelet clots in vitro of 21 strains of streptococci isolated from the blood of patients with sub-acute bacterial endocarditis (sabe)  was measured. the species, in order of greatest adhesion, were streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus milleri, streptococcus sanguis, dextran-positive streptococcus mitior, dextran-negative streptococcus mitior and  streptococcus salivarius. individual strains within species, however, cannot be assumed to be representative of their species and may exhibit unusually high or low adhesion. adhesion depended upon both bacterial concentration and period of contact. there was no simple relationship between ability to adhere and liability to cause endocarditis. formation of dextran did not increase adhesion. the streptococci were more adhesive than strains of escherichia coli and neisseria sicca and less adhesive than strains of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes.

TI  == effect of saccharin on growth and acid production of glucose-grown pathogenic and oral bacteria.
AB  == growth and acid production of glucose-grown gram-positive and gram-negative rods  as well as cocci from the human oral cavity were studied in the presence of 0.02  to 20.00 mg/ml sodium saccharin. all gram-positive rods, i.e. actinomyces viscosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bacillus subtilis and corynebacterium diphtheriae, and gram-positive cocci, i.e. streptococcus spp, staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus, were significantly inhibited by saccharin, especially at the higher concentrations. while gram-negative cocci, i.e. veillonella sp and neisseria sicca were strongly inhibited by all tested saccharin concentrations, gram-negative rods, i.e. the enterics and acinetobacter sp, exhibited little if any inhibition. saccharin caused a significant reduction  in fermentative acid production congruent with observed growth.

TI  == viability of six species of normal oropharyngeal bacteria after exposure to cigarette smoke in vitro.
AB  == bacteria in culture medium at 37 degrees c were subjected to eight puffs of smoke from one cigarette, and viable cell counts were done at intervals ranging from 0  min to 3 h after exposure to smoke. the cigarette contained 23.0 mg of tar and 1.4 mg of nicotine. each 25.0 ml puff of smoke from a mechanical smoking apparatus was passed over a 1.0 ml suspension of bacteria dispersed over a 25 cm2 surface in a sterile flask. filtered air was in contact with the suspension between puffs, and during the intervals between smoke treatment and viable cell counts being done. there was a marked decrease in numbers of viable branhamella catarrhalis at 15 min after exposure to smoke, and by 1 h there were no viable cells in suspensions which originally contained 10(7) bacteria. no reduction in the number of viable branhamella catarrhalis occurred in an untreated suspension  of the micro-organism. there was a marked decrease in viable neisseria perflava at 30 min, and by 3 h there were no viable cells. there was a 4 to 5 log10 reduction of viable neisseria sicca compared with untreated bacteria at 3 h after exposure to smoke. streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguis were less susceptible to the harmful action of cigarette smoke, and by 3 h there were 1 to 2 log10 differences in viable cell counts between smoke-treated and untreated bacteria. non-filter cigarette smoke had a greater detrimental effect on all species of bacteria studied than smoke from filter-tipped cigarettes.

TI  == interactions between neisseria sicca and viridin b, a bacteriocin produced by streptococcus mitis.
AB  == viridin b, a bacteriocin produced by streptococcus mitis (mitior), is bactericidal to neisseria sicca. oxygen consumption by actively growing n. sicca  cultures ceased immediately upon exposure to viridin b. adenosine triphosphate production was slightly enhanced within 1 h of exposure to the bacteriocin but was subsequently repressed. the uptake and incorporation of glucose was prevented in the presence of viridin b. the bacteriocin also blocked uptake of an amino acid mixture in chloramphenicol-pretreated cells. pretreatment or concomitant treatment with a variety of antibiotics known to inhibit specific synthetic pathways did not alter the inhibition of macromolecular synthesis produced by the bacteriocin. although viridin b blocks protein and nucleic acid syntheses, no degradation of such macromolecules was observed. the inhibitory effects of viridin b on macromolecular synthesis and on viability required the presence of sufficient nutrients to allow active metabolism of n. sicca. the bacteriocin did  not inhibit viability or macromolecular synthesis in anaerobically incubated n. sicca. thus, active, oxidative metabolism by n. sicca cells is essential for viridin b action. a model for viridin b action is proposed.

AB  == viridin b, a bacteriocin produced by streptococcus mitis strain 42885, was shown  previously to exert a bactericidal effect against a neisseria sicca strain but only a bacteriostatic effect against a coagulase-negative staphylococcus. in the  present report, this dual effect was defined further. viridin b caused the appearance of mesosomes in both indicator strains early in the course of exposure. whereas mesosomes were the only noticeable alterations in the staphylococcal strain at all times of exposure to bacteriocin, progressive changes occurred in the n. sicca cells involving the nucleoid and cytoplasmic contents and resulting in the appearance of bacterial ghosts. biochemical studies indicated a rapid and complete cessation of the incorporation of [3h]thymidine in n. sicca and in the staphylococcus. whereas the incorporation of [3h]leucine and  [3h]uridine in n. sicca was completely stopped, such incorporation was only reduced in the staphylococcus.

TI  == viridins, bacteriocins of alpha-hemolytic streptococci: isolation, characterization, and partial purification.
AB  == bacteriocin-like activities were detected in 78% of 120 alpha-hemolytic streptococcal isolates. inhibitory substances from three such isolates (one streptococcus sanguis strain and two s. mitis strains) were investigated further  and termed viridins (a, b, and c). the viridins were unique among bacteriocins of gram-positive bacteria in that they inhibited many gram-negative bacteria in addition to inhibition of a variety of gram-positive organisms. viridins were obtained in a cell-free state only after mechanical disruption of bacteriocinogenic cells but could not be isolated from supernatant fluids of cultures of such bacteria or from freeze-thaw liquor of agar on which the bacteria had been grown. viridin b could be partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and by gel filtration on a sephadex g-100 column. this bacteriocin had some unusual properties including heat lability, a narrow ph range of activity, and lack of adsorptive capacity to susceptible bacteria. although viridin b was bactericidal to a neisseria sicca strain, it was only bacteriostatic against a coagulase-negative staphylococcus.
