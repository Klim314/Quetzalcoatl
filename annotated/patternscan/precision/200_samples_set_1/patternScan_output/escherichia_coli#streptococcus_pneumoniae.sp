TI  == quaternized n-substituted carboxymethyl chitosan derivatives as antimicrobial agents.
AB  == introduction of quaternary ammonium moieties into n-substituted carboxymethyl chitosan (n-substituted cmch) derivatives enhances their biological activity. several derivatives of cmch having a variety of n-aryl substituents bearing either electron-donating or electron withdrawing groups have been synthesized by  the reaction between amino group of cmch with various aromatic aldehydes under acidic conditions, followed by reduction of the produced schiff base derivatives  with sodium cyanoborohydride. each of the reduced derivatives was further quaternized using n-(3-chloro-2-hydroxy-propyl)trimethylammonium chloride (quat-188). the resulting quaternized materials were characterized by ftir and (1)h nmr spectroscopy. their antibacterial activities against streptococcus pneumoniae (s. pneumonia, rcmb 010010), bacillis subtilis (b. subtilis, rcmb 010067), as gram positive bacteria and against escherichia coli (e. coli, rcmb 010052) as gram negative bacteria and their antifungal activities against aspergillus fumigatus (a. fumigates, rcmb 02568), geotricum candidum (g. candidum, rcmb 05097), and candida albicans (c. albicans, rcmb 05031) were examined using agar disk diffusion method. the results indicated that all the quaternized derivatives showed better antimicrobial activities than that of cmch. these derivatives are highly potent against gram positive bacteria compared to gram negative bacteria. this is illustrated for example as the values of minimum  inhibitory concentration (mic) of q4no2-bzcmch against b. subtilis and s. pneumonia were 6.25 and 12.5 mug/ml, respectively corresponded to 20.0 mug/ml against e. coli. the antimicrobial activity of quaternized n-aryl cmch derivatives affected by not only the nature of the microorganisms but also by the nature, position and number of the substituent groups on the phenyl ring. thus while the derivatives with groups of electron withdrawing nature show higher inhibition zone diameter and lower mic values relative to that of those having electron-donating nature, the non-substituted derivative lies between these two extremes. antibacterial activities of q4no2-bzcmch, q3cl-bzcmch and q3br-bzcmch against e. coli are nearly equivalent to that of the standard drug gentamycin. q3br-bzcmch emerged almost equivalent antibacterial activity to ampicillin against s. pneumonia.

AB  == mics to tigecycline and 12 antimicrobials were performed by microdilution method, against 2423 nonduplicate pathogens recently isolated in 17 greek hospitals. the  food and drug administration (fda) and european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) criteria were used comparatively for interpretation of tigecycline mics. tigecycline exhibited potent in vitro activity against the majority of the isolates tested. (mic(90) values of 0.5, 1,  2, 0.125, 1, 0.25, 0.125, and 1 mg/l were observed for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter spp., moraxella catarrhalis, acinetobacter spp., staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus spp., and streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, respectively.) tigecycline activity was the same, irrespective of the resistance profile to other antimicrobials (gram-negative pathogens susceptible or resistant to imipenem, enterococcus spp., s. aureus, or s. pneumoniae isolates, susceptible or resistant to vancomycin, methicillin or penicillin, respectively). interpretation using eucast and fda breakpoints differed among isolates of k. pneumoniae and enterobacter spp. having tigecycline mics of 2 to 4 mg/l. in conclusion, tigecycline exhibited potent activity against pathogens recently isolated in a region that experiences high antimicrobial resistance rates. indications that the available criteria might categorize differently tigecycline susceptibility status in k. pneumoniae and enterobacter spp. isolates were also detected.

TI  == maturation of streptococcus pneumoniae lipoproteins by a type ii signal peptidase is required for abc transporter function and full virulence.
AB  == cell surface lipoproteins are important for the full virulence of several bacterial pathogens, including streptococcus pneumoniae. processing of prolipoproteins seems to be conserved among different bacterial species, and requires type ii signal peptidase (lsp) mediated cleavage of the n-terminal signal peptide to form the mature lipoprotein. lsp has been suggested as a target for new antibiotic therapies, but at present there are only limited data on the function of lsp for gram-positive bacterial pathogens. we have investigated the function and role during disease pathogenesis of the s. pneumoniae lsp, which, blast searches suggest, is encoded by the gene sp0928. expression of sp0928 protected escherichia coli against the lsp antagonist globomycin, and proteomics  and immunoblot analysis demonstrated that deletion of sp0928 prevented processing of s. pneumoniae prolipoproteins to mature lipoproteins. these data strongly suggest that sp0928 encodes the s. pneumoniae lsp. however, immunoblots of membrane-associated proteins, immunoelectron microscopy and flow cytometry assays all confirmed that in the absence of lsp, immature lipoproteins were still attached to the cell surface. despite preservation of lipoprotein attachment to the cell membrane, loss of s. pneumoniae lsp resulted in several phenotypes associated with impaired lipoprotein function and reduced s. pneumoniae replication in animal models of infection.

TI  == transition-state analysis of s. pneumoniae 5'-methylthioadenosine nucleosidase.
AB  == kinetic isotope effects (kies) and computer modeling are used to approximate the  transition state of s. pneumoniae 5'-methylthioadenosine/s-adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase (mtan). experimental kies were measured and corrected for a small forward commitment factor. intrinsic kies were obtained for [1'-3h], [1'-14c], [2'-3h], [4'-3h], [5'-3h(2)], [9-15n] and [me-3h(3)] mtas. the intrinsic kies suggest an sn1 transition state with no covalent participation of the adenine or  the water nucleophile. the transition state was modeled as a stable ribooxacarbenium ion intermediate and was constrained to fit the intrinsic kies.  the isotope effects predicted a 3-endo conformation for the ribosyl oxacarbenium-ion corresponding to h1'-c1'-c2'-h2' dihedral angle of 70 degrees. ab initio hartree-fock and dft calculations were performed to study the effect of polarization of ribosyl hydroxyls, torsional angles, and the effect of base orientation on isotope effects. calculations suggest that the 4'-3h kie arises from hyperconjugation between the lonepair (n(p)) of o4' and the sigma* (c4'-h4') antibonding orbital owing to polarization of the 3'-hydroxyl by glu174. a [methyl-3h(3)] kie is due to hyperconjugation between np of sulfur and sigma* of  methyl c-h bonds. the van der waal contacts increase the 1'-3h kie because of induced dipole-dipole interactions. the 1'-3h kie is also influenced by the torsion angles of adjacent atoms and by polarization of the 2'-hydroxyl. changing the virtual solvent (dielectric constant) does not influence the isotope effects. unlike most n-ribosyltransferases, n7 of the leaving group adenine is not protonated at the transition state of s. pneumoniae mtan. this feature differentiates the s. pneumoniae and e. coli transition states and explains the 10(3)-fold decrease in the catalytic efficiency of s. pneumoniae mtan relative to that from e. coli.

TI  == structure and inhibition of a quorum sensing target from streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae 5'-methylthioadenosine/s-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase  (mtan) catalyzes the hydrolytic deadenylation of its substrates to form adenine and 5-methylthioribose or s-ribosylhomocysteine (srh). mtan is not found in mammals but is involved in bacterial quorum sensing. mtan gene disruption affects the growth and pathogenicity of bacteria, making it a target for antibiotic design. kinetic isotope effects and computational studies have established a dissociative s(n)1 transition state for escherichia coli mtan, and transition state analogues resembling the transition state are powerful inhibitors of the enzyme [singh, v., lee, j. l., nunez, s., howell, p. l., and schramm, v. l. (2005) biochemistry 44, 11647-11659]. the sequence of mtan from s. pneumoniae is  40% identical to that of e. coli mtan, but s. pneumoniae mtan exhibits remarkably distinct kinetic and inhibitory properties. 5'-methylthio-immucillin-a (mt-imma)  is a transition state analogue resembling an early s(n)1 transition state. it is  a weak inhibitor of s. pneumoniae mtan with a k(i) of 1.0 microm. the x-ray structure of s. pneumoniae mtan with mt-imma indicates a dimer with the methylthio group in a flexible hydrophobic pocket. replacing the methyl group with phenyl (pht-imma), tolyl (p-tolt-imma), or ethyl (ett-imma) groups increases the affinity to give k(i) values of 335, 60, and 40 nm, respectively. dadme-immucillins are geometric and electrostatic mimics of a fully dissociated transition state and bind more tightly than immucillins. mt-dadme-immucillin-a inhibits with a k(i) value of 24 nm, and replacing the 5'-methyl group with p-cl-phenyl (p-cl-pht-dadme-imma) gave a k(i) value of 0.36 nm. the inhibitory potential of dadme-immucillins relative to the immucillins supports a fully dissociated transition state structure for s. pneumoniae mtan. comparison of active site contacts in the x-ray crystal structures of e. coli and s. pneumoniae mtan with mt-imma would predict equal binding, yet most analogues bind 10(3)-10(4)-fold more tightly to the e. coli enzyme. catalytic site efficiency is primarily responsible for this difference since k(cat)/k(m) for s. pneumoniae mtan is decreased 845-fold relative to that of e. coli mtan.

TI  == antimicrobial, wound healing and antioxidant activity of plagiochasma appendiculatum lehm. et lind.
AB  == plagiochasma appendiculatum (aytoniaceae) of the order marchantiales is widely used in the form of paste ethnomedicinally by gaddi tribe in kangra valley for treating skin diseases. in this context, antimicrobical potential of plagiochasma appendiculatum against a wide range of microorganisms was studied. to validate the ethnotherapeutic claims of the plant in skin diseases, wound healing activity was studied, besides antioxidant activity to understand the mechanism of wound healing activity. the plant (alchoholic and aqueous extract) showed significant antibacterial and antifungal activity against almost all the organisms: micrococcus luteus, bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium, and eight fungi candida albicans and cryptococcus albidus-dimorphic fungi, trichophyton rubrum-dermatophyte fungi, aspergillus niger, aspergillus flavus, aspergillus spinulosus, aspergillus terreus and aspergillus nidulans-systemic fungi, with especially good activity against the dermatophyte (trichophyton rubrum) and some infectious bacteria (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and salmonella typhimurium) with an mic of 2.5 microg/disc. the results show that plagiochasma appendiculatum extract has potent wound healing capacity as evident  from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. the results also indicated that plagiochasma appendiculatum extract possesses potent antioxidant activity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and increase in the superoxide dismutase (sod) and catalase activity.

TI  == changing epidemiology of outpatient bacteremia in 3- to 36-month-old children after the introduction of the heptavalent-conjugated pneumococcal vaccine.
AB  == background: the introduction of routine vaccination with heptavalent conjugated pneumococcal vaccine has changed the overall incidence of bacteremia in children  3 months-3 years old. objective: to describe the changing incidence and etiology  of bacteremia in previously healthy toddlers presenting to outpatient clinical settings. methods: retrospective case series of all blood cultures obtained between september 1998 and august 2003 in kaiser permanente northern california outpatient clinics and emergency departments from previously healthy children 3 months-3 years old. results: implementation of routine vaccination with the conjugated pneumococcal vaccine resulted in an 84% reduction of streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia (1.3-0.2%) and a 67% reduction in overall bacteremia (1.6-0.7%) in the study population. the rate of blood culture isolation of contaminating organisms remained unchanged at 1.8%; therefore, by the end of the  study, >70% of organisms identified in blood cultures were contaminants. during the 5 study years, total blood cultures drawn decreased by 35% in outpatient pediatric clinics but remained unchanged in emergency departments. by 2003, one-third of all pathogenic organisms isolated from blood cultures were escherichia coli, one-third were non-vaccine serotype s. pneumoniae, the majority of the remaining one-third were staphylococcus aureus, salmonella spp., neisseria meningitidis and streptococcus pyogenes. in our population of children routinely  immunized with the conjugated pneumococcal vaccine, a white blood cell count >15,000 by itself is a poor predictor of bacteremia in the febrile toddler (sensitivity, 74.0%; specificity, 54.5%; positive predictive value, 1.5%; negative predictive value, 99.5%). conclusion: in the united states, routine vaccinations with haemophilus influenzae type b and s. pneumoniae vaccines have made bacteremia in the previously healthy toddler a rare event. as the incidence  of pneumococcal bacteremia has decreased, e. coli, salmonella spp. and staphylococcus aureus have increased in relative importance. the use of the white blood cell count alone to guide the empiric use of antibiotics is not indicated.  new guidelines are needed to approach the previously healthy febrile toddler in the outpatient setting.

TI  == cd44 deficiency leads to enhanced neutrophil migration and lung injury in escherichia coli pneumonia in mice.
AB  == cd44 is a major cell-surface receptor for hyaluronic acid (ha), a glycosaminoglycan component of extracellular matrix. ha-cd44 interactions have been implicated in leukocyte extravasation into an inflammatory site. this study  examined the role of cd44 in acute inflammatory responses during pneumonias induced by escherichia coli and streptococcus pneumoniae using cd44-deficient mice. in e. coli-induced pneumonia, neutrophil accumulation in the lungs and edema formation was increased by 84% and 88%, respectively, in cd44-deficient mice compared to wild-type mice. in contrast, no difference was observed between  these genotypes in s. pneumoniae-induced pneumonia, and the ha content in the lungs decreased after instillation of s. pneumoniae, but not e. coli, in both genotypes. studies to determine the mechanisms for this enhanced response showed  that: 1) neutrophil apoptosis was not different between these two genotypes in either type of pneumonia; 2) cd44 deficiency resulted in enhanced mrna expression of several inflammatory genes; and 3) cd44-deficient neutrophils migrated through matrigel in response to chemoattractants faster and in greater numbers than wild-type neutrophils in vitro and this increase was in part dependent on ha content in the matrigel. these data demonstrate that cd44 deficiency results in enhanced inflammation in e. coli but not s. pneumoniae-induced pneumonia, suggesting a previously unrecognized role for cd44 in limiting the inflammatory response to e. coli.

AB  == in the bacterial type ii fatty acid synthase system, beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein (acp) synthase iii (fabh) catalyzes the condensation of acetyl-coa with malonyl-acp. we have identified, expressed, and characterized the streptococcus pneumoniae homologue of escherichia coli fabh. s. pneumoniae fabh is approximately 41, 39, and 38% identical in amino acid sequence to bacillus subtilis, e. coli, and hemophilus influenzae fabh, respectively. the his-asn-cys  catalytic triad present in other fabh molecules is conserved in s. pneumoniae fabh. the apparent k(m) values for acetyl-coa and malonyl-acp were determined to  be 40.3 and 18.6 microm, respectively. purified s. pneumoniae fabh preferentially utilized straight short-chain coa primers. similar to e. coli fabh, s. pneumoniae fabh was weakly inhibited by thiolactomycin. in contrast, inhibition of s. pneumoniae fabh by the newly developed compound sb418011 was very potent, with an ic(50) value of 0.016 microm. sb418011 also inhibited e. coli and h. influenzae fabh with ic(50) values of 1.2 and 0.59 microm, respectively. the availability of purified and characterized s. pneumoniae fabh will greatly aid in structural studies of this class of essential bacterial enzymes and facilitate the identification of small molecule inhibitors of type ii fatty acid synthase with the potential to be novel and potent antibacterial agents active against pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == peptide deformylase as an antibacterial drug target: target validation and resistance development.
AB  == new inhibitors of peptide deformylase (pdf) which are very potent against the isolated enzyme and show a certain degree of antibacterial activity have recently been synthesized by our group. several lines of experimental evidence indicate that these inhibitors indeed interfere with the target enzyme in the bacterial cell. (i) the inhibition of escherichia coli growth could be counteracted by overexpression of pdf from different organisms, including e. coli, streptococcus  pneumoniae, and haemophilus influenzae. conversely, reduced expression of pdf in  s. pneumoniae resulted in an increased susceptibility to the inhibitors. (ii) proteome analysis on two-dimensional gels revealed a shift for many proteins towards lower pi in the presence of pdf inhibitors, as would be expected if the proteins still carry their n-formyl-met terminus. (iii) pdf inhibitors show no antimicrobial activity against e. coli under conditions that make growth independent of formylation and deformylation. the antibacterial activity in e. coli was characterized as bacteriostatic. furthermore, the development of resistance in e. coli was observed to occur with high frequency (10(-7)). resistant mutants show a reduced growth rate, and dna sequence analysis revealed  mutations in their formyl transferase gene. taking all these aspects into account, we conclude that pdf may not be an optimal target for broad-spectrum antibacterial agents.

TI  == in vivo activities of u-100592 and u-100766, novel oxazolidinone antimicrobial agents, against experimental bacterial infections.
AB  == the upjohn oxazolidinones, u-100592 and u-100766, are orally bioavailable synthetic antimicrobial agents with spectra of activity against antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens. in several mouse models of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infection, u-100592 and u-100766 yielded oral 50% effective doses (ed50) ranging from 1.9 to 8.0 mg/kg of body weight, which compared favorably with vancomycin subcutaneous ed50 values of 1.1 to 4.4 mg/kg. similarly, both compounds were active versus a staphylococcus epidermidis experimental systemic infection. u-100592 and u-100766 effectively cured an enterococcus faecalis systemic infection, with ed50 values of 1.3 and 10.0 mg/kg, and versus a vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium infection in immunocompromised mice, both drugs effected cures at 12.5 and 24.0 mg/kg. both compounds were exceptionally active in vivo against penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, with ed50 values ranging from 1.2 to 11.7 mg/kg in systemic infection models. in soft tissue infection models with s. aureus and e. faecalis, both compounds exhibited acceptable curative activities in the range of 11.0 to 39.0 mg/kg. u-100766 was also very active versus the bacteroides fragilis soft tissue infection model (ed50 = 46.3 mg/kg).  in combination-therapy studies, both u-100592 and u-100766 were indifferent or additive in vivo against a monomicrobic s. aureus infection in combination with other antibiotics active against gram-positive bacteria and combined as readily as vancomycin with gentamicin in the treatment of a polymicrobic s. aureus-escherichia coli infection. u-100592 and u-100766 are potent oxazolidinones active against antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens in experimental systemic and soft tissue infections.

TI  == cloning, expression, and nucleotide sequence of genes involved in production of pediocin pa-1, and bacteriocin from pediococcus acidilactici pac1.0.
AB  == the production of pediocin pa-1, a small heat-stable bacteriocin, is associated with the presence of the 9.4-kbp plasmid psrq11 in pediococcus acidilactici pac1.0. it was shown by subcloning of psrq11 in escherichia coli cloning vectors  that pediocin pa-1 is produced and, most probably, secreted by e. coli cells. deletion analysis showed that a 5.6-kbp sali-ecori fragment derived from psrq11 is required for pediocin pa-1 production. nucleotide sequence analysis of this 5.6-kbp fragment indicated the presence of four clustered open reading frames (peda, pedb, pedc, and pedd). the peda gene encodes a 62-amino-acid precursor of  pediocin pa-1, as the predicted amino acid residues 19 to 62 correspond entirely  to the amino acid sequence of the purified pediocin pa-1. introduction of a mutation in peda resulted in a complete loss of pediocin production. the pedb and pedc genes, encoding proteins of 112 and 174 amino acid residues, respectively, are located directly downstream of the pediocin structural gene. functions could  not be assigned to their gene products; mutation analysis showed that the pedb protein is not involved in pediocin pa-1 production. the mutation analysis further revealed that the fourth gene, pedd, specifying a relatively large protein of 724 amino acids, is required for pediocin pa-1 production in e. coli.  the predicted pedd protein shows strong similarities to several atp-dependent transport proteins, including the e. coli hemolysin secretion protein hlyb and the coma protein, which is required for competence induction for genetic transformation in streptococcus pneumoniae.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [bacteriological and clinical studies of panipenem/betamipron in pediatrics].
AB  == we carried out bacteriological and clinical studies of panipenem/betamipron (papm/bp), a newly-developed carbapenem antibiotic, in pediatrics, and the following results were obtained: 1. when antibacterial activities of panipenem (papm) were determined, it was found that mics against such gram-positive cocci as staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae and against such gram-negative rods as escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and branhamella catarrhalis were all sufficiently low. 2. papm showed better mic-correlated antibacterial activities against 215 subcultured strains of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) than imipenem. 3. clinical efficacies were evaluated to be excellent in 23 of 34 patients treated with papm/bp, excluding 3  patients from the efficacy evaluation. in addition, good responses were obtained  in 10 patients but poor response in one, showing the overall efficacy rate of 97.1%. as for bacteriological efficacies, the eradication rate was also determined to be high, 92.6%. 4. as for side effects, rash appeared in 2 patients, and soft stool and diarrhea occurred in one each. the overall incidence of side effects was calculated to be 10.8%. as for abnormal laboratory findings,  increases of eosinophiles in 4 patients, thrombocytes in 2, total bilirubin in 1, and got in 1 were observed. from these results, papm/bp was thought to be a highly useful drug in pediatrics.

TI  == in vivo evaluation of a dual-action antibacterial, ro 23-9424, compared to cefotaxime and fleroxacin.
AB  == the dual-action antibacterial r 23-9424 (desacetylcefotaxime linked to the quinolone fleroxacin) is a new antibacterial agent with excellent in vitro activity. it was evaluated for in vivo efficacy in comparison with the cephalosporin cefotaxime and the quinolone component, fleroxacin. ro 23-9424 demonstrated significant activity against all strains tested in systemic infections, including those strains resistant in vivo to cefotaxime (staphylococcus aureus 753, serratia marcescens sm and pseudomonas aeruginosa 8780) and fleroxacin (streptococcus pneumoniae 6301 and streptococcus pyogenes. in prophylactic studies, ro 23-9424 compared favorably with fleroxacin against escherichia coli and with cefotaxime against s. pyogenes, but ro 23-9424 was considerably more active than cefotaxime against e. coli and more active than fleroxacin against s. pyogenes. in a murine pneumonia model, ro 23-9424 was equivalent in activity to cefotaxime against s. pneumoniae and more active than cefotaxime against klebsiella pneumoniae. fleroxacin was inactive against s. pneumoniae and about 20-fold more active than ro 23-9424 against k. pneumoniae. in a murine meningitis infection caused by s. pneumoniae, ro 23-9424 was 3 times  as active as cefotaxime, while fleroxacin was inactive. when meningitis was induced by k. pneumoniae, ro 23-9424 was as active as the quinolone, while cefotaxime was inactive. in a neutropenic (immunocompromised) model, ro 23-9424 was more active than cefotaxime against p. aeruginosa and 5-fold less active than fleroxacin. in the control normal (immunocompetent) mouse infection, ro 23-9424 was 3-fold more active than cefotaxime, but 10-fold less active than fleroxacin.
