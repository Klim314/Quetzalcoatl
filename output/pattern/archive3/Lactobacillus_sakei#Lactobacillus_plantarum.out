a polyphasic approach to study the dynamics of microbial population of an organic wheat sourdough during its conversion to gluten-free sourdough.
to develop a method for organic gluten-free (gf) sourdough bread production, a long-term and original wheat sourdough was refreshed with gf flours. the dynamics of the sourdough microbiota during five months of back-slopping were analyzed by classical enumeration and molecular methods, including pcr-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (pcr-ttge), multiplex pcr, and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge). the results showed that the yeast counts remained constant, although saccharomyces cerevisiae, present in the initial wheat sourdough, was no longer detected in the gf sourdough, while lactic acid bacteria (lab) counts increased consistently. in the first phase, which was aimed at obtaining a gf sourdough from wheat sourdough, lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, l. plantarum, and l. spicheri were the main lab species detected. during the second phase, aimed at maintaining the gf sourdough, the l. plantarum and l. spicheri populations decreased whereas l. sanfranciscensis persisted and l. sakei became the predominant species. multiplex pcrs also revealed the presence of several l. sakei strains in the gf sourdough. in a search for the origin of the lab species, pcr-ttge was performed on the flour samples but only l. sanfranciscensis was detected, suggesting a flour origin for this typical sourdough species. thus, while replacement of the wheat flour by gf flour influenced the sourdough microbiota, some of the original sourdough lab and yeast species remained in the gf sourdough.
different immune regulatory potential of lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus sakei isolated from kimchi.
it is known that lactic acid bacteria (lab) have many beneficial health effects,  including antioxidative activity and immune regulation. in this study, the immune regulatory effects of lactobacillus sakei and lactobacillus plantarum, which are found in different types of kimchi, were evaluated. l. sakei and its lipoteichoic acid (lta) have greater immune stimulating potential in il-12, ifn-gamma, and tnf-alpha production as compared with l. plantarum in an in vitro condition. on the other hand, l. plantarum is assumed to repress the th1 immune response in murine experiments. after being injected with lps, l. plantarum-fed mice maintained a healthier state, and the level of tnf-alpha in their blood was lower than in other bacterial strainfed mice and in the lps-only control mice. additionally, il-12 production was significantly decreased and the production of il-4 was greatly increased in the splenocytes from l. plantarum-fed mice. further experiments revealed that the pre-injection of purified lta from l. plantarum (plta), l. sakei (slta), and s. aureus (alta) decreased tnf-alpha and il-4 production in lps-injected mice. mouse il-12, however, was significantly increased by alta pre-injection. in conclusion, the l. sakei and l. plantarum strains have immune regulation effects, but the effects differ in cytokine production and the regulatory effects of the th1/th2 immune response.
in vitro study of beneficial properties and safety of lactic acid bacteria isolated from portuguese fermented meat products.
many lactic acid bacteria produce bacteriocins with a rather broad spectrum of inhibition, which could offer potential applications in food preservation. bacteriocin production by starter cultures may bring advantage to these strains in competitive interactions with pathogenic bacteria from the food matrix. the objective of this study was to determine the safety of beneficial strains (lactobacillus plantarum st202ch and st216ch, enterococcus faecium st211ch, and lactobacillus sakei st22ch, st153ch and st154ch) previously isolated from fermented meat products and characterised as bacteriocin producers. auto-aggregation was strain-specific, and values of 28.97, 27.86 and 28.56% were recorded for l. sakei st22ch, st153ch and st154ch, respectively, 16.95 and 14.58% for l. plantarum st202ch and st216ch, respectively, and 12.77% for e. faecium st211ch. various degrees of co-aggregation between 28.85 and 44.76% for listeria monocytogenes 211 and 409, and between 23.60 to 34.96% for e. faecium atcc 19443 were observed. according to the results of the diffusion method, the studied strains demonstrated susceptibility to penicillin g, ampicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulonic acid, imipenem, linezolid, and tetracycline. in addition, the susceptibility of the six strains to various non-antibiotic commercial drugs was examined. production of beta-galactosidase by l. sakei st22ch, st153ch and st154ch, l. plantarum st202ch and st216ch, and e. faecium st211ch was confirmed by employing sterile filter paper discs impregnated with o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactopyranose. a statistically significant (p<0.001) inhibition of mycobacterium tuberculosis growth by bacteriocins produced by l. plantarum st202ch (38.3%) and st216ch (48.6%), l. sakei st153ch (16.2%) and st154ch (16.1%), and e. faecium st211ch (21.7%) was observed. as determined by the polymerase chain reaction, the tested strains showed a low virulence gene profile.
antifungal activity of lactobacilli and its relationship with 3-phenyllactic acid production.
in this study, 13 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains (including 5 lactobacillus casei, 2 lactobacillus rhamnosus, 2 lactobacillus fermentum, 1 lactobacillus acidophilus, 1 lactobacillus plantarum, 1 lactobacillus sakei, and 1 lactobacillus reuteri species) were assessed for both their antifungal activity against four food spoilage molds (colletotrichum gloeosporioides, botrytis cinerea, penicillium expansum, and aspergillus flavus) and their capability to produce the novel antimicrobial compound 3-phenyllactic acid (pla). results demonstrated that all molds were sensitive to varying degrees to the cell-free supernatants (cfs) from lab fermentations (p<0.05), with growth inhibitions ranging from 2.65% to 66.82%. the inhibition ability of cfs was not affected by a heating treatment (121 degrees c, 20 min); however, it declined markedly when the ph of cfs was adjusted to 6.5. with the exception of l. plantarum nrrl b-4496 and l. acidophilus atcc-4495, all other lab strains produced pla ranging from 0.021 to 0.275 mm. the high minimum inhibitory concentration for commercial pla (3.01-36.10mm) suggests that it cannot be considered the only compound related with the antifungal potential of studied lab and that synergistic effects may exist among other metabolism products.
lactobacillus sakei lipoteichoic acid inhibits mmp-1 induced by uva in normal dermal fibroblasts of human.
human skin is continuously exposed to ultraviolet (uv)-induced photoaging. uva increases the activity of mmp-1 in dermal fibroblasts through mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk), p38, signaling. the irradiation of keratinocytes by uva results in the secretion of the inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha), and the stimulation of mmp-1 in normal human dermal fibroblasts (nhdfs). lipoteichoic acid (lta) is a component of the cell wall of gram-positive lactobacillus spp. of bacteria. lta is well known as an anti-inflammation molecule. lta of the bacterium lactobacillus plantarum has an anti-photoaging effect, but the potential anti-photoaging effect of the other bacteria has not been examined to date. the current study showed that l. sakei lta (slta) has an immune modulating effect in human monocyte cells. our object was whether inhibitory effects of slta on mmp-1 are caused from reducing the mapk signal in nhdfs. it inhibits mmp-1 and mapk signaling induced by uva in nhdfs. we also confirmed effects of slta suppressing tnf-alpha inducing mmp-1 in nhdfs.
antibacterial activity of selected standard strains of lactic acid bacteria producing bacteriocins--pilot study.
introduction: in this paper, an attempt was made to evaluate the antibacterial potential of standard strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) producing bacteriocins of various classes, thus demonstrating various mechanisms of cell membrane damages against the streptococcus agalactiae strains (group b streptococcus, gbs), depending on surface polysaccharides and surface alpha-like protein genes. materials/methods: antimicrobial property of the strains of l. plantarum c 11, l. sakei dsmz 6333, and l. lactis atcc 11454 producing bacteriocins: jk and ef plantaricins, sakacin and nisin, respectively, against the gbs strains was evaluated. the chosen to the study gbs strains were represented by serotypes ia, ib, ii, iii, v and they had bca, epsilon, rib, alp2 or alp3 alpha-like protein genes. the experiment was conducted by means of suspension culture and the bacteria count was determined using the serial dilution method. results: a great ability of l. plantarum c 11 strain was proven to inhibit the gbs growth. the strain of l. sakei dsmz 6333 did not demonstrate any ability to inhibit the growth of gbs, whereas l. lactis atcc 11454 inhibited the growth of s. agalactiae indicator strains to a minor extent. statistically significant differences were demonstrated between the gbs strains representing various serotypes against the antimicrobial activity of model lab strains. the least sensitive to the activity of bacteriocins were the strains representing serotypes ib and iii, whereas the strains representing serotype ii were the most sensitive. the sensitivity of the gbs strains to the antimicrobial activity of lab was not dependent on alpha-like protein genes. discussion: among the lab standard strains producing bacteriocins, the strongest antimicrobial property was observed in the strain of l. plantarum c 11. because of the generally known and verified strong antagonistic property of the strains of l. plantarum species against indicator bacteria, it is necessary to further pursue the research presented in this paper.
construction of a food-grade cloning vector for lactobacillus plantarum and its utilization in a food model.
the development of lactobacillus plantarum to be used in starter cultures in the  food industry has been limited because of the lack of a food-grade cloning vector for the bacterium. in this study, the plasmid pflp1 was constructed by joining 2 dna fragments derived from food-approved organisms. the 5.2-kb bamhi/kpni dna fragment of prv566 containing the theta-type replicon of lactobacillus sakei was ligated to the bamhi/kpni dna fragment of a 2.9-kb lactococcal cadmium resistance determinant amplified from pnd918. the 8.1-kb newly constructed plasmid could transform l. plantarum n014, a bacteriocin-producing bacteria originally isolated from nham, a traditional thai fermented sausage. the resulting transformant, l. plantarum n014-flp, and its parent strain were shown to be very similar in growth rate and bacteriocin activity. in addition, the plasmid was very stable in its host bacteria under nonselective pressure for 100 generations in mrs medium and for 5 days in a nham model. these results suggest that pflp1 is a potential food-grade cloning vector for l. plantarum.
isolation and characteristics of lactic acid bacteria isolated from ripe mulberries in taiwan.
the objective of this study was to isolate, characterize, and identify lactic acid bacteria (lab) from ripe mulberries collected in taiwan. ripe mulberry samples were collected at five mulberry farms, located in different counties of taiwan. eighty-eight acid-producing cultures were isolated from these samples, and isolates were divided into classes first by phenotype, then into groups by restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analysis and sequencing of 16s ribosomal dna (rdna). phenotypic and biochemical characteristics led to identification of four bacterial groups (a to d). weissella cibaria was the most abundant type of lab distributed in four mulberry farms, and lactobacillus plantarum was the most abundant lab found in the remaining farm. ten w. cibaria and one lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis isolate produced bacteriocins against the indicator strain lactobacillus sakei jcm 1157(t). these results suggest that various lab are distributed in ripe mulberries and w. cibaria was the most abundant lab found in this study.
isolation and characterisation of selected lactic acid bacteria for improved processing of nem chua, a traditional fermented meat from vietnam.
nem chua is a traditional lactic acid fermented meat of vietnam that is consumed  raw. during fermentation, the number of acid-producing bacteria increased significantly and by the final day (4th), it had reached approximately 8.4 log cfu/g, contributing to 94% of the total microbiota of the product. out of 85 isolates obtained from the product, only 44 were confirmed gram-positive and catalase-negative. these putative lab isolates were purified and screened for antimicrobial and proteolytic activity. none of the isolates showed bacteriocin activity using the 'spot-on lawn' method, but showed antimicrobial activity against lactobacillus sakei and enterococcus faecium using deferred assay. four isolates showed good proteolytic activities at ph 7.0. these isolates were identified as lactobacillus plantarum using an api 50 chl i.d. kit. sequencing of the partial 16s rrna gene amplified by primers 1101f (5'-aacgagcgcaaccc-3') and 1407r (5'-gacgggcggtgtgtac-3') showed 98% homology to lactobacillus plantarum wcfs1.
the abi proteins and their involvement in bacteriocin self-immunity.
the abi protein family consists of putative membrane-bound metalloproteases. while they are involved in membrane anchoring of proteins in eukaryotes, little is known about their function in prokaryotes. in some known bacteriocin loci, abi genes have been found downstream of bacteriocin structural genes (e.g., pln locus from lactobacillus plantarum and sag locus from streptococcus pyogenes), where they probably are involved in self-immunity. by modifying the profile hidden markov model used to select abi proteins in the pfam protein family database, we show that this family is larger than presently recognized. using bacteriocin-associated abi genes as a means to search for novel bacteriocins in sequenced genomes, seven new bacteriocin-like loci were identified in gram-positive bacteria. one such locus, from lactobacillus sakei 23k, was selected for further experimental study, and it was confirmed that the bacteriocin-like genes (skkab) exhibited antimicrobial activity when expressed in a heterologous host and that the associated abi gene (skki) conferred immunity against the cognate bacteriocin. similar investigation of the abi gene plni and the abi-like gene plnl from l. plantarum also confirmed their involvement in immunity to their cognate bacteriocins (plnef and plnjk, respectively). interestingly, the immunity genes from these three systems conferred a high degree of cross-immunity against each other's bacteriocins, suggesting the recognition of a common receptor. site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that the conserved motifs constituting the putative proteolytic active site of the abi proteins are essential for the immunity function of skki, and to our knowledge, this represents a new concept in self-immunity.
co-factor engineering in lactobacilli: effects of uncoupled atpase activity on metabolic fluxes in lactobacillus (l.) plantarum and l. sakei.
the hydrolytic f(1)-part of the f(1)f(0)-atpase was over-expressed in lactobacillus (l.) plantarum nc8 and l. sakei lb790x during fermentation of glucose or ribose, in order to study how changes in the intracellular levels of atp and adp affect the metabolic fluxes. the uncoupled atpase activity resulted in a decrease in intracellular energy level (atp/adp ratio), biomass yield and growth rate. interestingly, the glycolytic and ribolytic flux increased in l. plantarum with uncoupled atpase activity compared to the reference strain by up to 20% and 50%, respectively. the atp demand was estimated to have approximately 80% control on both the glycolytic and ribolytic flux in l. plantarum under these conditions. in contrast, the glycolytic and ribolytic flux decreased in l. sakei with uncoupled atpase activity.
factors affecting the adsorption of bacteriocins to lactobacillus sakei and enterococcus sp.
bacteriocins bacjw3bz and bacjw6bz produced by lactobacillus plantarum, and bacjw11bz and bacjw15bz produced by lactobacillus fermentum, inhibit gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. treatment of enterococcus sp. hklhs and lactobacillus sakei dsm 20017 with these bacteriocins deformed the cells and resulted in dna and beta-galactosidase leakage. the bacteriocins adsorbed to sensitive and resistant strains. optimal adsorption of bacjw3bz and bacjw6bz to enterococcus sp. hklhs was recorded at ph 10.0, whereas adsorption of bacjw11bz and bacjw15bz was favored at ph 4.0-8.0 and 2.0-4.0, respectively. adsorption to l. sakei dsm 20017 was less influenced by ph. incubation temperature had a major influence on the adsorption of bacjw6bz and bacjw11bz to sensitive cells, with better results recorded below 30 degrees c. although variable results were recorded for bacjw3bz and bacjw15bz, optimal adsorption occurred between 37 and 60 degrees c. variable levels of adsorption were recorded in the presence of inorganic salts and solvents, and this seems to be species-specific. maximal adsorption (100%) was recorded for bacjw3bz and bacjw15bz to l. sakei dsm 20017 in the presence of most inorganic salts and solvents tested. maximal adsorption of bacjw6bz to enterococcus sp. hklhs (50%) was recorded in the presence of triton x-114 and little (17%) or no adsorption in the presence of other reagents.
quorum-sensing based bacteriocin production is down-regulated by n-terminally truncated species of gene activators.
down-regulation of quorum-sensing based pathways is an important but yet poorly understood process in bacterial gene regulation. in this study, we show that the gene regulator plnc not only acts as an activator gene in the quorum-sensing based bacteriocin production in lactobacillus plantarum c11, but it also concurrently codes for truncated forms that were shown to repress bacteriocin production. by amino acid n-terminal sequencing and dna sequence analysis, the truncated species of plnc are believed to be translated from alternative start codons located in the so-called receiver domain of the regulator. to analyse the structure-function relationship of truncated species of plnc, we performed a series of systematic truncation mutations: ten in the receiver domain, one in the hinge region and two in the c-terminal dna-binding domain. it was revealed that any truncation mutation containing a disrupted receiver domain together with an intact dna-binding domain displayed a repressive effect on bacteriocin production. such a gene repression mechanism mediated by truncated regulators was also found in two other quorum-sensing based bacteriocin systems (spp in l. sakei lth673 and nc8-pln in l. plantarum nc8), suggesting that this mode of repression might represent a common means applied by bacteria to down-regulate certain quorum-sensing based pathways.
lactic acid bacteria associated with vacuum-packed cooked meat product spoilage:  population analysis by rdna-based methods.
aim: to determine the lactic acid bacteria (lab) implicated in bloating spoilage  of vacuum-packed and refrigerated meat products. methods and results: a total of 18 samples corresponding to four types of meat products, with and without spoilage symptoms, were studied. in all, 387 colonies growing on de man, rogosa and sharpe, yeast glucose lactose peptone and trypticase soy yeast extract plates were identified by internal spacer region (isr), isr-restriction fragment length polymorphism and rapid amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis profiles as lactobacillus (37%), leuconostoc (43%), carnobacterium (11%), enterococcus (4%) and lactococcus (2%). leuconostoc mesenteroides dominated the microbial population of spoiled products and was always present at the moment bloating occurred. lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus curvatus were found in decreasing order of abundance. the analysis of two meat products, 'morcilla' and 'fiambre de magro adobado' obtained from production lines revealed a common succession pattern in lab populations in both products and showed that leuc. mesenteroides became the main species during storage, despite being below the detection level of culture methods after packing. conclusions: our results pointed to leuc. mesenteroides as the main species responsible for bloating spoilage in vacuum-packed meat products. significance and impact of the study: prevention of bloating spoilage in vacuum-packed cooked meat products requires the sensitive detection of leuc. mesenteroides (i.e. by pcr).
factors affecting the adsorption of bacteriocins st194bz and st23ld to lactobacillus sakei and enterococcus sp.
bacteriocins st194bz and st23ld, produced by lactobacillus plantarum, inhibit gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. images obtained by atomic force microscopy showed clear signs of membrane damage of lactobacillus sakei, accompanied by the leakage of dna and beta-galactosidase. adsorption of the bacteriocins to cells was increased when cells were treated with buffers at ph values above neutral. an increase in bacteriocin st194bz adsorption to cells of enterococcus sp. and l. sakei was observed with an increase in incubation temperatures, but at different rates for the two species. treatment of the two species with various inorganic salts and solvents gave different results regarding the adsorption of the two bacteriocins. in general, pre-treatment of the two sensitive cells with triton x-100, triton x-114 and chloroform increased the adsorption of the two bacteriocins. increased adsorption of bacteriocin st23ld to l. sakei was recorded when the cells were pre-treated with tris and nh4-citrate. treatment of enterococcus sp. and l. sakei with na-edta and sds decreased the adsorption of the two bacteriocins. variable results were recorded with inorganic salts.
parameters affecting the adsorption of plantaricin 423, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus plantarum 423 isolated from sorghum beer.
plantaricin 423 is bactericidal to logarithmic and stationary-phase cells of enterococcus sp. hklhs and l. sakei dsm 20017. detection of extracellular dna and beta-galactosidase suggests that the mode of action is most probably by destabilizing of the cell membrane. adsorption of plantaricin 423 to target cells ranged from 17% for streptococcus caprinus atcc 700066 to 67% for lactobacillus plantarum lmg 13556, lactobacillus curvatus df38, listeria innocua lmg 13568 and lactobacillus sakei dsm 20017. treatment of enterococcus sp. hklhs and l. sakei dsm 20017 with triton x-100, triton x-114 and chloroform increased the adsorption of plantaricin.
improved expression and purification of the correctly folded response regulator plnc from lactobacilli.
the response regulator plnc is part of the signal transduction system that plays  a key role in the regulation of bacteriocin production in lactobacillus plantarum c11. in this study, we wanted to express high levels of the response regulator plnc in a soluble and native form for purification and further studies. the protein was expressed as a fusion protein (fplnc) containing an n-terminal flag-tag to facilitate detection and purification. when the fusion gene, fplnc, was expressed in escherichia coli bl21, nearly all (99%) of the recombinant protein ended up inside inclusion bodies as an incorrectly folded protein. by utilizing two different gram-positive expression systems (sip and nice) in l. plantarum nc8 and lactobacillus sakei lb790, the expression of the soluble fplnc was significantly increased, being 20-40 times more than that in e. coli bl21. using the n-terminal tag, the expressed protein was purified by immunoprecipitation. by dna-binding study (emsa), we demonstrated that the fusion protein purified from the soluble pool was correctly folded as judged by its ability to bind specifically on regulated promoters. using our approach, we estimate that about 1 mg of fplnc can be purified from 11 of the bacterial culture.
high-level, inducible gene expression in lactobacillus sakei and lactobacillus plantarum using versatile expression vectors.
vectors have been developed for inducible gene expression in lactobacillus sakei  and lactobacillus plantarum in which expression of the gene of interest is driven by strong, regulated promoters from bacteriocin operons found in l. sakei strains. the activity of these promoters is controlled via a two-component signal transduction system, which responds to an externally added peptide pheromone. the vectors have a modular design, permitting easy exchange of all essential elements: the inducible promoter, the cognate regulatory system, the gene of interest, the antibiotic resistance marker and the replicon. various variants of these so-called 'psip' vectors were constructed and tested, differing in terms of the bacteriocin regulon from which the regulatory elements were derived (sakacin a or sakacin p), the regulated promoter selected from these regulons, and the replicon (derived from p256 or psh71). using beta-glucuronidase (gusa) and aminopeptidase n (pepn) as reporters, it was shown that the best vectors permitted inducible, pheromone-dose-dependent gene expression at very high levels, while displaying moderate basal activities when not induced. the most effective set-up was obtained using a vector containing the psh71 replicon, the orfx promoter from the sakacin p regulon, and the cognate regulatory genes, in a l. sakei host. gusa levels obtained with this set-up were approximately ten times higher than the levels obtained with prototype psip versions, whereas pepn levels amounted to almost 50% of total cellular protein.
evaluation of meat born lactic acid bacteria as protective cultures for the biopreservation of cooked meat products.
in this study, 91 strains, originating from meat products, were subjected to a step-by-step screening and characterisation to search for potential protective cultures to be used in the cooked cured meat industry. strains were first tested on their homofermentative and psychrotrophic character and salt tolerance. secondly, the antibacterial capacities towards listeria monocytogenes, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc carnosum and brochotrix thermosphacta were determined in an agar spot test. in total, 38% of the tested strains were inhibitory towards all indicator strains. however, 91%, 88% and 74% of the strains could inhibit, respectively, l. monocytogenes, b. thermosphacta and leuc. mesenteroides. finally, 12 strains, with the highest antibacterial capacities, were evaluated on their competitive nature by comparing their growth rate, acidifying character and lactic acid production at 7 degrees c under anaerobic conditions in a liquid broth. all 12 strains, except for a bacteriocin producing lactobacillus plantarum strain and the lactocin s producing lactobacillus sakei 148, combined a fast growth rate with a deep and rapid acidification caused by the production of high levels of lactic acid. the 12 selected strains were then further investigated for their growth capacity on a model cooked ham product to establish whether the presence of these cultures on the ham did not negatively influence the sensory properties of the ham. all strains grew in 6 days at 7 degrees c from a level of 10(5)-10(6) to 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g and again the bacteriocin producing l. plantarum strain was the slowest growing strain. as the glucose level of the model cooked ham product was low (0.09+/-0.03%), growth of the putative protective cultures resulted in glucose depletion and a limited lactic acid production and accompanying ph decrease. cooked ham inoculated with isolates 13e, 10a, 14a (all three identified as l. sakei subsp. carnosus by sds-page) and with strains l. sakei 148 (ls5) and l. sakei subsp. carnosus saga 777 (ls8) were not rejected by the sensory panel at the 34th day of the vacuum packaged storage at 7 degrees c. therefore, these strains could have potential for the use as protective culture in cooked meat products.
use of bacteriocin promoters for gene expression in lactobacillus plantarum c11.
aims: to exploit promoters involved in production of the bacteriocin sakacin p for regulated overexpression of genes in lactobacillus plantarum c11. methods and results: production of sakacin p by lact. sakei lth673 is controlled by a peptide-based quorum sensing system that drives strong, regulated promoters. one of these promoters (porfx) was used to establish regulated overexpression of genes encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase from bacillus pumilus, aminopeptidase n from lactococcus lactis or chitinase b from serratia marcescens in lact. plantarum c11, a strain that naturally possesses the regulatory machinery that is necessary for promoter activation. the expression levels obtained were highly dependent on which gene was used and on how the promoter was coupled to this gene. the highest expression levels (14% of total cellular protein) were obtained with the aminopeptidase n gene translationally fused to the regulated promoter. conclusions: sakacin promoters permit regulated expression of a variety of genes in lact. plantarum c11. significance and impact of the study: this study shows the usefulness of regulated bacteriocin promoters for developing new gene expression systems for lactic acid bacteria, in particular lactobacilli.
characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from a greek dry-fermented sausage in respect of their technological and probiotic properties.
a total of 147 lactic acid bacteria was isolated from two types of naturally fermented dry sausages at four different stages of the ripening process studied in order to select the most suitable strains according to their technological characteristics including probiotic properties and antimicrobial activity against food-borne pathogens. identification of the isolates revealed that 90% were lactobacilli, 4% enterococci, 3% pediococcus sp. and sporadic isolates of weissella viridescens, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, and leuconostoc sp. the isolated strains of lactobacillus sakei (49 isolates), lactobacillus curvatus (24 isolates) and lactobacillus plantarum (7 isolates) were further characterized. all strains could grow at 15 degrees c, whereas the majority of the strains was able to grow in the presence of 6.5% nacl and on acetate agar. the enzymatic potential of the strains was evaluated using the api zym system. during in vitro investigations all strains exhibited high leucine and valine aminopeptidase activities and moderate acid phosphatase and phosphohydrolase activities. some strains showed very weak lipolytic activity. the enzyme profiling is an important factor for selection of strains as starter cultures. a large majority of the strains tolerated 0.1% bile salts whereas 58% of lactobacillus curvatus strains and all lactobacillus plantarum strains were resistant to 0.3% bile salts. all lactobacillus sakei strains and the majority of lactobacillus curvatus and lactobacillus plantarum strains exhibited an anti-listerial activity against three listeria monocytogenes strains. a percentage of 75, 50 and 29% of lactobacillus sakei, l. curvatus and l. plantarum strains, respectively, could inhibit two staphylococcus aureus strains. the contribution of the selected strains to a possible inhibition of listeria monocytogenes and s. aureus in situ on fermented meats would be of considerable interest to enhance the hygienic quality of these products.
development of an inducible gene expression system for lactobacillus sakei.
aim: to develop an inducible gene expression system for lactobacillus sakei, based on the regulatory system of sakacin a production. methods and results: a lactobacillus/escherichia coli shuttle vector; pkrv3, was constructed including the signal transducing system genes of the bacteriocin sakacin a. the gusa gene fused to psapa promoter, cloned in this vector allowed for inducible beta-glucuronidase expression in l. sakei and l. plantarum following the addition of the sakacin a inducing peptide. psapa appeared to be a strong and tightly controlled promoter when compared with known promoters. conclusion: the pkrv3 system can be used as an inducible gene expression system in lactobacilli. significance and impact of the study: a novel, inducible gene expression system has been developed for lactic acid bacteria relevant in food fermentations.
