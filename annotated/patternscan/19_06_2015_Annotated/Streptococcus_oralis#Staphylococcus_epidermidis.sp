TI  == colostrum of healthy slovenian mothers: microbiota composition and bacteriocin gene prevalence.
AB  == microbial communities inhabiting the breast milk microenvironment are essential in supporting mammary gland health in lactating women and in providing gut-colonizing bacterial 'inoculum' for their infants' gastro-intestinal development. bacterial dna was extracted from colostrum samples of 45 healthy slovenian mothers. characteristics of the communities in the samples were assessed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) coupled with denaturing gradient gel  electrophoresis (dgge) and by quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr). pcr screening for the prevalence of bacteriocin genes was performed on dna of culturable and total colostrum bacteria. dgge profiling revealed the presence of staphylococcus  and gemella in most of the samples and exposed 4 clusters based on the abundance  of 3 bands: staphylococcus epidermidis/gemella, streptococcus oralis/pneumonia and streptococcus salivarius. bacilli represented the largest proportion of the communities. high prevalence in samples at relatively low quantities was confirmed by qpcr for enterobacteria (100%), clostridia (95.6%), bacteroides-prevotella group (62.2%) and bifidobacteria (53.3%). bacterial quantities (genome equivalents ml-1) varied greatly among the samples; staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococci varied in the range of 4 logs, streptococci and all bacteria varied in the range of 2 logs, and other researched groups varied in the range of 1 log. the quantity of most bacterial groups was correlated with the amount of all bacteria. the majority of the genus staphylococcus was represented by the species staphylococcus epidermidis (on average 61%), and their abundances were linearly correlated. determinants of salivaricin a, salivaricin b, streptin and cytolysin were found in single samples. this work provides knowledge on the colostrum microbial community composition of healthy lactating slovenian mothers and reports bacteriocin gene prevalence.

TI  == infectious keratitis following corneal crosslinking: a systematic review of reported cases: management, visual outcome, and treatment proposed.
AB  == abstract aim: to describe the infectious complications and the group of pathogens involved in the infection following corneal crosslinking, the visual outcome, and the treatment proposed. methods: a medline (national library of medicine, bethesda, md, usa) search from october 2000 to october 2013 was performed to identify all articles describing infectious keratitis following corneal crosslinking treatment. nineteen articles were selected. ten articles reported infectious complications of corneal crosslinking treatment were included. nine articles were excluded, because seven described sterile keratitis, one article was in german, and one reported general complication without describing the infection complication. results: a total number of infections reported included 10 eyes. the infectious keratitis was associated with bacteria in five eyes (50%): gram-positive bacteria in three eyes (30%) (staphylococcus epidermidis, s. aureus and streptococcus salivarius plus s. oralis, respectively) and gram-negative bacteria in two eyes (20%) (e. coli; p. aeruginosa); there was herpes virus in two eyes, fungus in two eyes (fusarium and microsporidia) (20%),  and acanthamoeba in one eye (10%). conclusions: only 10 cases of infectious keratitis following corneal crosslinking are published. the most virulent pathogens were pseudomonas aeruginosa and acanthamoeba. less virulent organisms were escherichia coli and s. epidermidis. two cases of herpes keratitis were described, suggesting the possibility of systemic antiviral prophylaxis before corneal crosslinking treatment. the most common risk factor of infections identified was postoperative incorrect patient behavior.

TI  == rapid detection of gram-positive organisms by use of the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test and the bact/alert pediatric fan system in a multicenter pediatric evaluation.
AB  == assays that expedite the reporting of organism identification and antibiotic susceptibility status in positive blood cultures can fast track interventions that improve clinical outcomes. we evaluated the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test (bc-gp) in two pediatric hospitals. positive bact/alert pediatric fan blood cultures with gram-positive organisms were tested using the bc-gp in tandem with routine laboratory procedures. to test organisms underrepresented in the clinical blood culture evaluation, blood culture bottles  were spiked with diluted organism suspensions at concentrations of 10 to 100 cfu  per milliliter. a total of 249 gram-positive bacterial isolates were recovered from 242 blood cultures. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, and methicillin-resistant s. aureus with sensitivities of 100%, 99%, and 100% and specificities of 100%, 100%, and 99.5%,  respectively. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible s. epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis  with sensitivities of 95%, 80%, and 96%, respectively, and 100% specificity. the  bc-gp correctly identified 14/15 cases of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus  faecium bacteremia and 9 cases of streptococcus pneumoniae. it misidentified 5/15 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis and 1/3 blood cultures spiked with streptococcus anginosus group as s. pneumoniae. the bc-gp detected a case of streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia but failed to detect 2/3 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus agalactiae. bc-gp's rapid accurate detection of staphylococcus spp., e. faecium, and e. faecalis and its ability to  ascertain meca, vana, and vanb status may expedite clinical decisions pertaining  to optimal antibiotic use. false-positive s. pneumoniae results may warrant reporting of only "streptococcus spp." when this organism is reported by the bc-gp.

TI  == daptomycin concentrations in valve tissue and vegetation in patients with bacterial endocarditis.
AB  == in a patient with mitral-aortic native-valve streptococcus oralis endocarditis, daptomycin concentrations in aortic and mitral valves were 8.6 and 30.8 mug/g, respectively, and 26 mug/g in the mitral vegetation. in the case of porcine-aortic-valve staphylococcus epidermidis endocarditis, the daptomycin concentrations were 53.1 mug/g in the valve and 18.1 mug/g in perivalvular tissues. daptomycin achieved apparently adequate tissue concentrations. s. epidermidis was eradicated, whereas streptococcus oralis persisted, and its daptomycin mic displayed a 4-fold increase.

TI  == evaluation antimicrobial and antiadhesive properties of the biosurfactant lunasan produced by candida sphaerica ucp 0995.
AB  == different groups of biosurfactants exhibit diverse properties and display a variety of physiological functions in producer microorganisms; these include enhancing the solubility of hydrophobic/water-insoluble compound, heave metal binding, bacterial pathogenesis, cell adhesion and aggregation, quorum sensing and biofilm formation. candida sphaerica was grown in a low cost medium, consisting of distilled water supplemented with 9% refinery residue of soybean oil and 9% corn steep liquor, for 144 h at 28 degrees c and 150 rpm. the cell-free supernatant obtained at the end of the experiments was submitted to extraction, and afterward the biosurfactant was isolated using methanol with a yield of 9 g l(-1). the critical micelle concentration of the biosurfactant was found to be 0.25 mg ml(-1) with a surface tension of 25 mn m(-1). several concentrations of the biosurfactant (0.625-10 mg ml(-1)) were used to evaluate its antimicrobial and antiadhesive activities against a variety of microorganisms. the biosurfactant showed antimicrobial activity against streptococcus oralis (68%), candida albicans (57%), and staphylococcus epidermidis(57.6%) for the highest concentration tested. furthermore, the biosurfactant at a concentration of 10 mg ml(-1) inhibited the adhesion between 80 and 92% of pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus sanguis12. inhibition of adhesion with percentages near 100% occurred for the higher concentrations of biosurfactant used. results gathered in this study point to a potential use of the biosurfactant in biomedical applications.

TI  == [the analysis of the bacterial and fungal flora in maxillary sinuses in patients  operated due to fess method].
AB  == introduction: the aim of this work was to analyse the bacterial and fungal flora  in maxillary sinuses in patients operated due to the fess method. material and methods: studies were conducted on 110 patients, including 47 women aged 17-78 and 63 men aged 17-66, who underwent endoscopic surgical procedures due to chronic polypoid maxillary sinusitis between 2006 and 2007. 214 cultures were prepared altogether. during the endoscopic operation on paranasal sinuses, a cannula was introduced along the natural entrance and material for the culture and antibiogram was removed by suction. results: in the studied material of 214 cultures, 72 (33.6%) cultures obtained positive results, including 2 cases with bacterial and fungal floras present simultaneously (aspergillus fumigatus and aspergillus niger) in 38 operated patients. in 25 (34.5%) cultures we noted the presence of staphylococcus epidermidis, which was sensitive to the following antibiotics: cotrimoxazole, rifampicin, vankomycin, teicoplanin and levofloxacin. staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated in 22 (31.0%) cultures, showing 100% sensitivity to similar antibiotics like the previous one. another bacteria (escherichia coli) was cultured in 10 cultures (13.8%), in 70% of the cases every second bacteria was staphylococcus epidermidis with 100% sensitivity mainly to cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. in 3 cultures (4.17%) we found klebsiella pneumoniae, with 100% sensitivity to cephalosporins and aminoglycosides and 100%  resistance to penicillins. in three cases pseudomonas fluorescens and proteus mirabilis (4.17% each) were cultured with their sensitivity and resistance similar to those of klebsiella pneumoniae. two cases (2.8% each) in the cultures  were noted: citrobacter freundii, streptococcus oralis and hafnia alvei, which were 100% sensitive to some cephalosporins and aminoglycosides whereas their resistance to penicillins and cefuroxime was as high as 100%. conclusion: in the  operated patients suffering from chronic polypoid maxillary sinuses we found 33.6% of positive results in the bacterial flora. this indicates that the changes were accompanied by an acute inflammatory condition, thus surgical procedures had to be followed by a guided antibiotic. the cultured bacteria demonstrated sensitivity to some cephalosporins and aminoglycosides and resistance to penicillins, which proves the abuse of penicillins in the treatment of acute inflammatory states of upper airways.

TI  == a quantitative approach to the effectiveness of ozone against microbiota organisms colonizing toothbrushes.
AB  == objectives: toothbrushes are rapidly contaminated with different microorganisms,  which colonize the oral cavity and interdental spaces. this can represent a possible cause of infection or reinfection. in this study, the ozone experimental effect upon toothbrushes microflora was estimated microbiologically before and after saturation with ozone gas. methods: fifty used toothbrushes coming from children and adults were entered our study. microorganisms were enumerated and identified. bristles from each brush were soaked in ozone saturated pbs solution  for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min and the total microbial population was reassessed. results: counts of microorganisms isolated per brush varied between 10(2) and 10(7) cfu. candida albicans was present in used toothbrushes. no obligate anaerobes were isolated. members of streptococcaceae family were regularly found  (65.2%) belonging to the following species: streptococcus pyogenes, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. sobrinus, s. viridans, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, aerococcus viridans. a. viridans and s. mutans were more frequently isolated on children toothbrushes while staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis were found on adults  brushes. escherichia coli, pseudomonas sp. and enterococcus sp., were also recovered. we found that the ozone treatment decreased gradually the microbial load. however, a bacterial re-growth was effective following short ozonation period. decontamination was complete after an extended exposure to ozone for 30 min. conclusions: ozone application was found to remove the toothbrushes bristles microbiota following conventional brushing. maximum decontamination efficacy of ozone treatment was observed after 30 min while exposure for short time periods seems to be inefficient which probably reflect the low dose of ozone used in this study.

TI  == linezolid resistance since 2001: sentry antimicrobial surveillance program.
AB  == background: the oxazolidinone class of antimicrobials has demonstrated remarkable activity against gram-positive cocci. linezolid has proven to be a first-line therapeutic option for vancomycin-resistant strains. linezolid clinical trial results and subsequent published case reports cite rare resistance emerging in patients receiving prolonged therapy. objective: to report the initial linezolid-resistant organisms from cases obtained through the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program, after screening >40,000 gram-positive cocci without resistance between 1998 and 2000. methods: during 2001-2002, 8 resistant  strains (from 8 different patients) located in 6 states from 7 different participating sentry institutions in the us were identified among bloodstream, respiratory, skin and soft tissue, and urinary tract infection isolates of enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus oralis. resistance was detected by reference broth microdilution methods and confirmed by identical results using etest (ab biodisk, solna, sweden) and the standardized disk diffusion method. results: minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and disk diffusion tests showed elevated mics (> or =8 microg/ml) and small inhibitory zone diameters (< or =15 mm) for all strains to both linezolid and the investigational oxazolidinone azd2563. vancomycin resistance was detected in 2 of the 8 linezolid-resistant strains. all enterococci and the viridans-group streptococcus (s. oralis) strain showed resistance to erythromycin. e. faecium strains were resistant to penicillins, but susceptible to quinupristin/dalfopristin. only 3 of the patients had previously received the drug. conclusions: linezolid resistance remains rare, with only 8 isolates among 9833 (0.08%) monitored isolates identified between january 1, 2001, and june 30, 2002. resistance, however, was no longer limited to enterococci. clinical laboratories should test linezolid more widely to detect emerging resistance, especially for patients receiving oxazolidinone therapy. longitudinal surveillance programs are warranted to detect a trend in the development of resistance, determine the molecular mechanism of resistance, and recommend alternative therapies or epidemiologic interventions.

TI  == [bacteriologic evaluation of middle ear fluid during the course of secretory otitis media in children].
AB  == fluid collected from tympanic cavity during operation from 43 children with o.m.s. was subjected to bacteriological examination. after the collection, each sample was immediately applied to bactec peds plus/f liquid medium from becton dickinson. the number of samples, where each genus and species of bacteria were found, was determined, as well as the number of samples where every two genus coexisted; also the ph genes, in which each genus was found were calculated. obtained results showed that 22 species of bacteria, belonging to 6 genus lived in the samples. the most commonly occurring genus were staphylococcus, streptococcus and haemophilus; the most rare genus were moraxella and bacillus. the most common species were: haemophilus influenzae (18.6% of samples), staphylococcus aureus (14.0%), staphylococcus epidermidis (11.6%), staphylococcus warneri (9.3%) and streptococcus oralis (7.0%). streptococcus coexisted most frequently with staphylococcus and haemophilus; staphylococcus--with haemophilus  and bacillus; haemophilus--with streptococcus and staphylococcus. the ph ranges for the three most often found genus were: for staphylococcus--7.7-9, for streptococcus--7.7-9.3 and for haemophilus--8.2-8.8.

TI  == origins of staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus oralis causing bacteraemia in a bone marrow transplant patient.
AB  == coagulase-negative staphylococcal bacteraemia in immunocompromised patients is often associated with the use of central venous catheters, while the proposed origin of viridans streptococci causing bacteraemia in this patient group is the  oral cavity. this report describes an episode of polymicrobial bacteraemia caused by staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus oralis followed by several further episodes of s. epidermidis bacteraemia in a 15-year-old boy after bone marrow transplantation. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) of smai chromosomal dna digests was used to compare blood culture and oral isolates of s. epidermidis and str. oralis. the results indicated that the mouth was the source  of both s. epidermidis and str. oralis causing the first episode of bacteraemia.  pfge further demonstrated that the central venous catheter was the origin of a second strain of s. epidermidis responsible for subsequent episodes of staphylococcal bacteraemia. both the oral mucosa and central venous lines should  be considered as potential sources of organisms, including coagulase-negative staphylococci, associated with bacteraemia in immunocompromised patients.

TI  == comparison of the indigenous oral microbiota and immunoglobulin responses of athymic (nu/nu) and euthymic (nu/+) mice.
AB  == the role of the immune system in the homeostasis of indigenous oral bacterial populations is poorly understood. in this study, we compared the evolution of the indigenous oral microbiota of specific pathogen-free athymic nude (nu/nu) balb/c  mice with that of their corresponding phenotypically normal (nu/-) littermates. we also evaluated corresponding salivary and serum antibody activities (iga and igg) against the predominant indigenous oral bacteria. the bacterial species recovered from the two mouse strains were lactobacillus murinus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus oralis and staphylococcus epidermidis. from 27 days of age, nu/+ and nu/nu mice had significantly different proportions of oral bacterial populations. when the microbiota stabilized (at 40 days of age), the total cultivable microbiota of nu/+ mice was dominated by l. murinus (65-85%), while that of nu/nu mice was dominated by e. faecalis (40-60%). the precise factors that alter the oral resident microbiota in nu/nu mice are unknown. we found that total salivary iga levels were significantly lower in nu/nu mice, but  no association were observed between the level of salivary iga antibody against indigenous bacteria and the proportion of these indigenous bacteria in the oral microbiota. the change in the microbiota of nude mice may have been caused by other factors such as defects in other immune functions or cold stress.

TI  == bacteria in human mouths involved in the production and utilization of hydrogen peroxide.
AB  == earlier studies have demonstrated that pure cultures of oral streptococci produce hydrogen peroxide but none has found any free peroxide in dental plaque or salivary sediment despite streptococci being major components of their mixed bacterial populations. the absence of peroxide in plaque and sediment could be due to the dominance of its destruction over its formation by bacterial constituents. to identify which of the oral bacteria might be involved in such a  possibility, pure cultures of 27 different oral bacteria were surveyed (as well as dental plaque and sediment) for their peroxide-forming and peroxide-removing capabilities. peroxide production was measured for each of the pure cultures by incubation with glucose at low and high substrate concentrations (2.8 and 28.0 mm) for 4 h and with the ph kept at 7.0 by a ph-stat. removal of hydrogen peroxide was assessed in similar experiments where peroxide at 0, 29.4, 147.2 or  294.4 mm [0, 0.1, 0.5 and 1% (w/v)] replaced the glucose. hydrogen peroxide formation was seen with only three of the bacteria tested, streptococcus sanguis  i and ii (sanguis and oralis), and strep. mitior (mitis biotype i); levels of hydrogen peroxide between 2.2 and 9.8 mm were produced when these micro-organisms were grown aerobically and 1.1 and 3.9 mm when grown anaerobically. earlier reports indicate that such levels were usually sufficient to inhibit the growth of many plaque bacteria. the amounts formed were similar at the two glucose levels tested, suggesting that maximum peroxide production is reached at low glucose concentration. none of the three peroxide-producing organisms was able to utilize hydrogen peroxide but five of the other 24 tested, neisseria sicca, haemophilus segnis, h. parainfluenzae, actinomyces viscosus and staphylococcus epidermidis, could readily do so, as could the mixed bacteria in salivary sediment and dental plaque, both of which contain relatively high numbers of these peroxide-utilizing micro-organisms. the ability of the bacteria in plaque and sediment to degrade hydrogen peroxide was considerable and extremely rapid; peroxide removal and usually complete within the first 15 min of the incubation even when its initial level was as high as 294.4 mm. this almost overwhelming ability to remove peroxide was confirmed when peroxide-producing and -using cultures were mixed and when each of eight salivary sediments was incubated with  glucose and with peroxide at concentrations up to 294.4 mm. in the glucose incubations, no hydrogen peroxide was observed, indicating dominance of microbial peroxide removers over hydrogen peroxide producers.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == immunobiological activities of bacteria isolated from the root canals of postendodontic teeth with persistent periapical lesions.
AB  == although intraradicular bacteria are widely considered to be the primary etiological agents of periapical lesions, the immunobiological properties of the  species in question are not adequately known. the aim of this study, therefore, was to investigate the pathobiological properties of the 10 most frequently isolated endodontopathic bacterial species. using cellular components of the pathogens obtained by sonic extraction, we have investigated their ability to induce monocyte migration, interleukin 1 production, mitogenic responses of lymphocytes, and the polyclonal activation of b lymphocytes. it was found that all of the tested species enhanced the migration of monocytes and induced mitogenesis in b lymphocytes. the polyclonal activation of b cells and the induction of interleukin 1 by monocytes were found to be stronger in gram-negative anaerobes. furthermore, all of the tested species excluding bacteroides oralis were poor t cell mitogens. these findings show that a wide range of pathobiological properties are attributable to the most frequently isolated endodontic pathogens. it thus seems plausible that a battery of complex  immunological responses induced by such microbes lead to the formation of persistent periapical lesions.

TI  == bacteriology of dental abscesses of endodontic origin.
AB  == aspirates have been cultured from 10 dental abscesses of endodontic origin, all of which had penetrated beyond the bony alveolus to produce fluctuant swelling. sampling was by syringe aspiration. strict anaerobic techniques, including the use of an anaerobic chamber, were used for serial dilution and plating. randomly  selected colonies (100) from each culture were purified, characterized, and identified. seventy percent of the bacterial isolates were either strict anaerobes or microaerophilic. one abscess yielded a pure culture of a viridans streptococcus, streptococcus milleri. streptococcus intermedius dominated the flora in a second abscess. the common oral streptococcus, streptococcus sanguis,  constituted only 2% of the isolates from one additional infection. fusobacterium  nucleatum, bacteroides melaninogenicus, other bacteroides including b. oralis and b. ruminicola, anaerobic diphtheroids, peptostreptococcus micros, and staphylococcus epidermis were other predominant isolates.
