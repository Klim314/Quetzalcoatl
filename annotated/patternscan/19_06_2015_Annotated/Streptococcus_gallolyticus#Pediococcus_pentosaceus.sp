TI  == the dominant microbial community associated with fermentation of obushera (sorghum and millet beverages) determined by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  == obushera includes four fermented cereal beverages from uganda namely: obutoko, enturire, ekitiribita and obuteire, whose microbial diversity has not hitherto been fully investigated. knowledge of the microbial diversity and dynamics in these products is crucial for understanding their safety and development of appropriate starter cultures for controlled industrial processing. culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques including denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and mixed dna sequencing of polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) amplified ribosomal rna genes were used to study the bacteria and  yeast diversity of obushera. the ph dropped from 6.0-4.6 to 3.5-4.0 within 1-2 days for obutoko, enturire and obuteire whereas that of ekitiribita decreased to  4.4 after 4 days. counts of lactic acid bacteria (lab) increased from 5.0 to 11.0 log cfug(-1) and yeasts increased from 3.4 to 7.1 log cfug(-1) while coliform counts decreased from 2.0 to <1 log cfug(-1) during four days of fermentation. lab and yeast isolates were identified by rrna gene sequence analysis. lab isolates included: enterococcus spp., lactobacillus (lb.) plantarum, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc lactis, streptococcus (s.) infantarius subsp. infantarius, pediococcus pentosaceus and weisella (w.) confusa. dgge indicated predominance of s. gallolyticus, s. infantarius subsp. infantarius, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, w. confusa, lb. reuteri, fructobacillus spp., l. lactis and l. lactis. yeast isolates included clavispora  lusitaniae, cyberlindnera fabianii, issatchenkia orientalis and saccharomyces cerevisiae. dgge indicated predominance of s. cerevisiae in obutoko, enturire and obuteire and also detected pichia spp. and i. orientalis in obutoko. obushera produced in the laboratory was initially dominated by enterobacteriaceae and later by lactococcus spp. enterobacteriaceae and bacillus spp. were also detected in ekitiribita. development of starters for obushera may require combinations of  lab and s. cerevisiae for obutoko, enturire and obuteire and lab for ekitiribita.

TI  == molecular characterization of lactic acid bacteria and in situ amylase expression during traditional fermentation of cereal foods.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria play an important role in traditional fermented foods consumed in different countries. study of their taxonomic structure and diversity is necessary for starter culture selection, improved safety and nutritional enhancement. to achieve these objectives, microbial genomic typing methods were used to study genetic differences of autochthonous bacteria and their distribution in two traditional african fermented cereal foods. a total of 85 predominant bacterial species were isolated from ogi and kunu-zaki obtained from  northern and southern geographical region of nigeria. they were identified using  combination of 16s rrna gene sequencing, multilocus sequence analysis (mlsa) based on rpoa, phes and atpa genes as well as m13-pcr gel fingerprints. the results showed that lactobacillus fermentum was the most frequently isolated species in ogi (71.4%) and kunu-zaki (84.5%). other species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) identified were lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus and pediococcus pentosaceus. non lactic acid bacteria isolated from these foods were species belonging to the bacillus and staphylococcus. non-metric multidimensional scaling (nmds) analysis of the m13-pcr fingerprints for lab strains showed clonal diversity among strains of the same species. in vitro and in situ expression of amylase gene during fermentation by amylolytic l. plantarum ulag11 was detected, indicating the potential usefulness of such species for development of starter cultures and for controlled fermentation processes.

TI  == the gram-positive tonsillar and nasal flora of piglets before and after weaning.
AB  == aims: to investigate gram-positive nasal and tonsillar microbial flora of piglets before and after weaning. methods and results: the nasal and tonsillar gram-positive bacterial flora of 20 non-weaned piglets (2 weeks of age) and 20 weaned piglets (6 weeks of age), obtained from four different piggeries, was quantified by culture and identified by tdna-pcr. the most widely occurring species from nasal conchae before as well as after weaning in the different piglets investigated were streptococcus suis and rothia nasimurium. after weaning a wide variety of lactobacillus species appeared but in low numbers. in the tonsils, strep. suis, strep. dysgalactiae, s. hyicus, s. aureus, arcanobacterium  pyogenes and actinomyces hyovaginalis were the species isolated from the largest  number of pigs before and after weaning. s. aureus and most lactobacilli became more prevalent after weaning. bacteria not known to be associated with pigs found in the present study included r. nasimurium, strep. gallolyticus, pediococcus pentosaceus and some lactobacillus species. conclusions: over 30 different gram-positive bacterial species may occur in nasal conchae and tonsils of unweaned piglets at 2 weeks of age and of 6-week-old weaned piglets. significance and impact of the study: this study demonstrated that weaning is associated with  changes in prevalence of only a small minority of the highly diversified bacterial flora of the nares and tonsils of pigs.
