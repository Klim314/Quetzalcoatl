TI  - Characterization of Beta-lactamases in Faecal Enterobacteriaceae Recovered from Healthy Humans in Spain: Focusing on AmpC Polymorphisms.
AB  - The intestinal tract is a huge reservoir of Enterobacteriaceae, some of which are opportunist pathogens. Several genera of these bacteria harbour intrinsic antibiotic resistance genes, such as ampC genes in species of Citrobacter, Enterobacter or Escherichia genera. In this work, beta-lactamases and other resistance mechanisms have been characterized in Enterobacteriaceae isolates recovered from healthy human faecal samples, focusing on the ampC beta-lactamase genes. Fifty human faecal samples were obtained, and 70 Enterobacteriaceae bacteria were isolated: 44 Escherichia coli, 4 Citrobacter braakii, 9 Citrobacter freundii, 8 Enterobacter cloacae, 1 Proteus mirabilis, 1 Proteus vulgaris, 1 Klebsiella oxytoca, 1 Serratia sp. and 1 Cronobacter sp. A high percentage of resistance to ampicillin was detected (57 %), observing the AmpC phenotype in 22 isolates (31 %) and the ESBL phenotype in 3 isolates. AmpC molecular characterization showed high diversity into bla CMY and bla ACT genes from Citrobacter and Enterobacter species, respectively, and the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis demonstrated low clonality among them. The prevalence of people colonized by strains carrying plasmid-mediated ampC genes obtained in this study was 2 %. The unique plasmid-mediated bla AmpC identified in this study was the bla CMY-2 gene, detected in an E. coli isolate ascribed to the sequence type ST405 which belonged to phylogenetic group D. The hybridization and conjugation experiments demonstrated that the ISEcp1-bla CMY-2-blc structure was carried by a ~78-kb self-transferable IncK plasmid. This study shows a high polymorphism among beta-lactamase genes in Enterobacteriaceae from healthy people microbiota. Extensive AmpC-carrier studies would provide important information and could allow the anticipation of future global health problems.
TI  - Prevalence of community acquired urinary tract infections in Silchar Medical College, Assam, India and its antimicrobial susceptibility profile.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to know the rate of prevalence of community  acquired UTI infections in both males and females, Assam, North-East India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 50 mul of urine sample from each of the subjects was streaked on cystine lactose electrolyte-deficient agar medium. The plates were incubated overnight at 37 degrees C. Pure, isolated colonies of each type was separately cultured and characterized. The susceptibility of the clinical isolates to routinely prescribed antibiotics in the hospital was performed against various antibiotics. RESULTS: Of the total 40 patients, 26 positive samples were obtained of which 19 females (73.07%) and 7 male (26.92%) patients were shown to be urine culture positive. The most commonly isolated bacterium was Escherichia coli with a frequency rate of (33.3%) followed by Staphyloccous aureus (22.2%), Klebsiella pnemoniae (11.1%), coagulase negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) (7.4%), Pseudomonas sp. (7.4%), Proteus myxofaciens (3.7%), Proteus mirabilis (3.7%), Edwardsiella tarda (3.7%), Morganella morganii (3.7%), and Citrobacter fruendii (3.7%). Analysis of the samples showed that UTI was more common in females of younger age group as compared with males. It was also observed that the patients responded effectively to imepenem (IE), cepefime, amikacin, norfloxacin, and co-trimoxazole antimicrobial agents against Gram-negative bacilli. Furthermore, the most effective antibiotics against Gram-positive cocci was found to be ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, IE, and penicillin G (benzyl penicillin). CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotics have been in use for a long period and more often the misuse of antimicrobial drugs has today led to a general rise in the emergence of resistant bacteria.
TI  - Surveillance of multidrug resistant uropathogenic bacteria in hospitalized patients in Indian.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To record surveillance, antibiotic resistance of uropathogens of hospitalized patients over a period of 18 months. METHODS: Urine samples from wards and cabins were used for isolating urinary tract infection (UTI)-causing bacteria that were cultured on suitable selective media and identified by biochemical tests; and their antibiograms were ascertained by Kirby-Bauer's disc diffusion method, in each 6-month interval of the study period, using 18 antibiotics of five different classes. RESULTS: From wards and cabins, 1 245 samples were collected, from which 996 strains of bacteria belonging to 11 species were isolated, during April 2011 to September 2012. Two Gram-positive, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis), and nine Gram-negative bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii, Citrobacter sp., Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated. Both S. aureus and E. faecalis were vancomycin resistant, and resistant-strains of all pathogens increased in each 6-month period of study. Particularly, all Gram-negatives were resistant to nitrofurantoin and co-trimoxazole, the most preferred antibiotics of empiric therapy for UTI. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiograms of 11 UTI-causing bacteria recorded in this study indicated moderately higher numbers of strains resistant to each antibiotic studied, generating the fear of precipitating fervent episodes in public health particularly with bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and S. aureus. Moreover, vancomycin resistance in strains of S. aureus and E. faecalis is a matter of concern.
TI  - Molecular diversity of class 2 integrons in antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria found in wastewater environments in China.
AB  - The molecular architecture of class 2 integrons among gram-negative bacteria from wastewater environments was investigated in Jinan, China. Out of the 391 antibiotic-resistant bacteria found, 38 isolates harboring class 2 integrons encoding potentially transferrable genes that could confer antibiotic resistance were found. These isolates were classified into 19 REP-PCR types. These strains were identified using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and found to be as follows: Proteus mirabilis (16), Escherichia coli (7), Providencia spp. (7), Proteus spp. (2), P. vulgaris (3), Shigella sp. (1), Citrobacter freundii (1), and Acinetobacter sp. (1). Their class 2 integron cassette arrays were amplified and then either analyzed using PCR-RFLP or sequenced. The typical array dfrA1-sat2-aadA1 was detected in 27 isolates. Six atypical arrays were observed, including three kinds of novel arrangements (linF2(attC1)-dfrA1(attC2)-aadA1-orf441 or linF2(attC1)-dfrA1(attC2)-aadA1, dfrA1-catB2-sat2-aadA1, and estX(Vr)-sat2-aadA1) and a hybrid with the 3'CS of class 1 integrons (dfrA1-sat2-aadA1-qacH), and dfrA1-sat1. Twenty-four isolates were also found to carry class 1 integrons with 10 types of gene cassette arrays. Several non-integron-associated antibiotic resistance genes were found, and their transferability was investigated. Results showed that water sources in the Jinan region harbored a diverse community of both typical and atypical class 2 integrons, raising concerns about the overuse of antibiotics and their careless disposal into the environment.
TI  - Microbiological profile of orbital abscess.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the culture and sensitivity pattern is necessary, for the institution of appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy in orbital abscess. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to describe culture and sensitivity patterns of specimens from the orbit and surrounding structures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospectively the medical records of 56 cases of orbital abscess were reviewed. RESULTS: Cultures were positive in 38/56 (68.8%) orbital specimens and the organisms included Staphylococcus aureus 18, Streptococci 7, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 3, 2 each of Enterobactersp, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter sp. and 1 each of Actinomyces israelii, Diptheroids, Coagulase negative Staphylococcus, Citrobacter freundii, Methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Four had polymicrobial infection. Culture of purulent nasal discharge, swabs taken from foci of infection on the face, and blood cultures were done in 26/56, and positive cultures were obtained in 16/26 (61.5%) specimens. In 12 patients, there was a concurrence in the organism cultured from the orbit and from cultures from other sites. Gram-negative organisms were associated with increased ocular morbidity. CONCLUSION: Gram-positive cocci, especially S. aureus are the most common organisms isolated from orbital abscesses. Infections by Gram-negative organisms were associated with more complications. Empirical intravenous antibiotic therapy should have a broad spectrum of activity effective against a wide range of Staphylococcal organisms and Gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - There is a low incidence of recurrent bacteriuria in painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis patients followed longitudinally.
AB  - The objective of this paper was to establish whether patients with confirmed painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis (PBS/IC) presenting with symptoms of UTI have actual bacteriuria vs a flare of their PBS/IC symptoms. One hundred and six (n = 106) consecutive female patients (mean age 39.8 +/- 14 years) with newly diagnosed IC were identified and followed longitudinally for 24 months. At the initial visit and at all subsequent visits, urinary specimens were obtained by sterile catheterization (Bard 14Fr female) and cultured for bacteria. Eight patients had an initially positive urine culture, and repeat cultures 8 weeks after treatment were all negative. Once sterile urine was established, the diagnosis of PBS/IC was confirmed. A pelvic pain/urgency/frequency (PUF) questionnaire score was obtained from 89 patients. After the diagnosis of PBS/IC, all patients received multimodal treatment. Patients were instructed to present to the office whenever they developed symptoms of UTI, at which time a sterile catheter specimen was obtained and sent for culture. Greater than 10(3) colonies were considered positive. Patients who did not report flares were contacted to establish whether unreported treatments were given. Seventy-two patients (68%) had no UTI episodes or flares. The remaining 34 patients (32%) presented with 54 flares, of which 44 were culture-negative and 10 were culture-positive. A single flare was reported by 21 patients during the 24 months, with three positive cultures (14.3%). Recurrent UTI symptoms (two to four flares) were seen in a small group (n = 13) for a total of 33 flares. Of these, seven had two flares each (12 negative, 2 positive), five had three flares each (12 negative, 3 positive), and one patient had four flares (two negative, two positive). Therefore, within the group with recurrent symptoms, seven positive cultures were obtained for a rate of recurrent bacteriuria of 6.6% (7/106). Nine of the 10 positive bacterial cultures were due to gram-negative bacteria: Escherichia coli (n = 6), Proteus mirabilis (n = 1), Klebsiella pneumonia (n = 1), and Citrobacter sp. (n = 1). One grew Streptococcus sp. There was no difference between the flare group and nonflares in regards to age or PUF scores between groups. This study is the first to report on the low incidence of confirmed UTIs in a large group of PBS/IC patients followed longitudinally. These data suggest that only a small number of PBS/IC patients with UTI symptoms have positive urine cultures (9.4%; 10/106). Although the symptoms of recurrent UTI are prevalent in IC patients, the incidence of confirmed recurrent UTIs is only 6.6%. Because the flares of IC are usually self-limiting, treatment response to antibiotics may be misleading in light of the low incidence of positive urine cultures. These data suggest that the symptom flares of IC are not usually associated with recurrent UTI and, therefore, are likely due to a triggering of the other painful mechanisms involved in IC patients who are culture-negative.
TI  - Mechanical transmission of pathogenic organisms: the role of cockroaches.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Cockroaches (Diploptera punctata) are basically tropical insects and will do their best to find a home that is both warm and moist. Their involvement in the transmission of tropical diseases is poorly investigated in Africa. METHODS: A study on the bacterial, fungal and parasitic profile of cockroaches trapped in and around houses in Ekpoma was carried out using standard microbiological techniques. RESULTS: Of a total of 234 cockroaches trapped from different sites (toilets, parlours, kitchens and bedrooms) in houses with pit latrines and water system, the bacterial, fungal and parasitic isolates were identical irrespective of the site, these included: E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella sp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serretia marcescens, S. aureus, S. feacalis, S. epidermidis, Aeromonas sp, Candida sp, Rhizopus sp, Aspergillus sp, Mucor sp, cysts of E. hystolitica, oocysts of C. parvum, C. cayetenensis and Isospora belli, cysts of Balantidium coli, ova of Ascaris lumbricoides, Anchylostoma deodunalae, Enterobius vermicularis, ova Trichuris trichura, larva of Strongyloides stercoralis. Cockroaches trapped in the toilets of houses with pit latrines had a mean bacterial and parasites count of 12.3 x 10(10) org/ml and 98 parasites/ml respectively, while those trapped in the houses with water system had a mean bacterial and parasitic count of 89.5 x 10(7) org/ml and 31 parasites/ml respectively. A bacterial count of 78.9 x 10(7) org/ml was recorded from cockroaches trapped from the kitchens of houses with pit latrines. On the other hand a mean bacterial and parasitic count of 23.7 x 10(6) org/ml and 19 parasites/ml were recorded from kitchens of houses with water system. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Cockroaches represent an important reservoir for infectious pathogens, therefore, control of cockroaches will substantially minimise the spread of infectious diseases in our environment.
TI  - Incidence of enteric bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus in day care centers in Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria.
AB  - The incidence of enteric bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus in four day care centers in Akwa Ibom State was studied using culture techniques. The percentage frequencies of the isolates from 124 samples were Staphylococcus aureus (33.9), Escherichia coli (19.0), Klebsiella sp (14.4), Citrobacter sp (12.5) and Proteus mirabilis (7.4). The sources of contamination were floors, chairs, skin, bed linen, door handles, fans, children's tables, walls, windows, ceiling, headmistress's table and chairs, drinking water and wash water. Cultures from Aunty Chimmy's Day Care and Nursery School, Eket and Ideal Day Care and Nursery School, Eket yielded more organisms than those from Trinity International Nursery School, Ikot Ekpene and Adiaha Obong Day Care Center in Uyo. The results revealed the insanitary conditions in these day care centers. The enforcement of an effective public health enlightenment program is advocated in order to attract sufficient attention of the proprietors of these establishments to the role of fomites as reservoirs of pathogenic microorganisms.
TI  - Cost-effective and rapid presumptive identification of gram-negative bacilli in routine urine, pus, and stool cultures: evaluation of the use of CHROMagar orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests.
AB  - The algorithm for a new identification system was designed on the basis of colony color and morphology on CHROMagar Orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests such as indole (IND), lysine decarboxylase (LDC), and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) utilization tests with gram-negative bacilli isolated from urine samples as well as pus, stool, and other clinical specimens by the following colony characteristics, biochemical reactions, and serological results: pinkish to red, IND positive (IND(+)), Escherichia coli; metallic blue, IND(+), LDC(+), and ODC negative (ODC(-)), Klebsiella oxytoca; IND(+), LDC(-), and ODC(+), Citrobacter diversus; IND(+) or IND(-), LDC(-), and ODC(-), Citrobacter freundii; IND(-), LDC(+), and ODC(+), Enterobacter aerogenes; IND(-), LDC(-), and ODC(+), Enterobacter cloacae; IND(-), LDC(+), and ODC(-), Klebsiella pneumoniae; diffuse brown and IND(+), Morganella morganii; IND(-), Proteus mirabilis; aqua blue, Serratia marcescens; bluish green and IND(+), Proteus vulgaris; transparent yellow-green, serology positive, Pseudomonas aeruginosa; clear and serology positive, Salmonella sp.; other colors and reactions, the organism was identified by the full identification methods. The accuracy and cost-effectiveness of this new system were prospectively evaluated. During an 8-month period, a total of 345 specimens yielded one or more gram-negative bacilli. A total of 472 gram-negative bacillus isolates were detected on CHROMagar Orientation medium. For 466 of the isolates (98.7%), no discrepancies in the results were obtained on the basis of the identification algorithm. The cost of identification of gram-negative bacilli during this period was reduced by about 70%. The results of this trial for the differentiation of the most commonly encountered gram-negative pathogens in clinical specimens with the new algorithm were favourable in that it permitted reliable detection and presumptive identification. In addition, this rapid identification system not only significantly reduced costs but it also improved the daily work flow within the clinical microbiology laboratory.
TI  - [The resistance of recent clinical isolates against isepamycin, other aminoglycosides and injectable beta-lactams].
AB  - Clinical isolates collected from clinical facilities across Japan in 1998 were tested against five aminoglycosides and three beta-lactams. The resistance of 50 strains each of methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., Serratia sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus sp. (P. mirabilis 25 strains and P. vulgaris 25 strains) to the aminoglycosides isepamicin (ISP), amikacin (AMK), gentamicin, tobramycin and dibekacin, and to the beta-lactams imipenem, ceftazidime and piperacillin (all three known to be effective against P. aeruginosa) were investigated using a micro liquid dilution method with the following results: 1. ISP was effective against all strains except for 14% of MRSA, 2% of Proteus sp., and 4% of P. aeruginosa. 2. Six strains of MRSA were resistant to all eight drugs; however, in these cases ISP exhibited a relatively low minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) compared to the other compounds. 3. Four strains of MRSA were resistant to all drugs except ISP. MRSA was the only isolate to demonstrate a resistance to seven or more drugs. 4. Twenty-one strains of MRSA and 1 strain of P. aeruginosa were resistant to six drugs; however, all of these were susceptible to both ISP and AMK. 5. Against all strains tested, ISP generally exhibited a lower MIC compared to AMK. These results suggest that, even ten years after its entering the market, ISP is still an aminoglycoside having a high anti-bacterial activity against a wide range of clinical isolates.
TI  - [Antibiotic sensitivity to isolated bacteria in pediatric urinary tract infections].
AB  - Of the childhood urinary tract infections, more than 50% are caused by Escherichia coli (E Coli), followed by Proteus mirabilis (P mirabilis), Klebsiella sp, other enterobacteria, enterococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococci. Of E coli isolates, 50 to 60% are resistant to ampicillin (ampi-R), 10% being susceptible to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (AMC). For P mirabilis, ampi-R isolates are less frequent and more often susceptible to AMC. Klebsiella sp is resistant to ampicillin, 75% of isolates being susceptible to AMC. In these three species, the susceptibility of isolates to third generation cephalosporins, aminogly-cosides, and ciprofloxacin is still high (> 90%), but 15 to 35% are resistant to cotrimoxazole. In the other enterobacteria (Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, P vulgaris, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens) the resistance to cefalotin (hence to ampicillin and AMC) is permanent, with an exception: the susceptibility of P vulgaris to AMC. Enterococci are mostly susceptible to ampicillin, and P aeruginosa to ceftazidime, but in both species, the percentage of resistant strains in hospitalised patients is greater than in outpatients. For Staphylococcus aureus, the community-acquired isolates are susceptible to oxacillin and other anti-staphylococcal agents. All the coagulase negative staphylococci isolates are susceptible to vancomycin, but 70% of those from hospitalised patients are resistant to oxacillin, aminoglycosides and cotrimoxazole.
TI  - [Treatment of lower respiratory tract infections in the elderly].
AB  - Sixty outpatients at the age of 65 to 75 years with exacerbated chronic bronchitis were treated with antibiotics: amoxycillin/clavulanic acid (20 patients), cefaclor (20 patients) and ciprofloxacin (20 patients). The treatment course in all the cases was 5 days. Bacteriological tests of the sputum specimens and estimation of the isolate antibiotic susceptibility by the disk diffusion method were applied to all the patients before and after the treatment. 73 per cent of the patients had mixed infection. The microflora mainly included various species of streptococci highly susceptible to the drugs (54 per cent) as well as highly susceptible strains of pneumococci and hemophilic bacilli (33 and 17 per cent respectively). Atypical microflora was detected in 10 per cent of the cases. Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were isolated in 2 cases. Acinetobacter sp. slightly susceptible only to ciprofloxacin was isolated in 1 case. Citrobacter sp. slightly susceptible to cefaclor and moderately susceptible to ciprofloxacin was detected in 1 case. Enterobacter sp. moderately susceptible only to ciprofloxacin was isolated in 1 case. A positive factor was moderate susceptibility of Proteus mirabilis to all the three drugs. In 24 patients (the average age of 54.7 years) the pharmacokinetics of ofloxacin administered under 2 different regimens was studied. The drug was used in a single dose of 400 mg once a day (group 1) or in a dose of 200 mg twice a day (group II) followed by estimation of the drug concentration in the blood and sputum. The pathogen eradication was stated in 61.5 and 72.7 per cent of the patients in groups I and II, respectively. By the results of the treatment with the use of the above mentioned antibiotics in the elderly patients fluoroquinolones should be considered preferable from the clinical and pharmacoeconomic viewpoints.
TI  - A comparative study of the BBL crystal enteric/nonfermenter identification system and the biomerieux API20E and API20NE identification systems after overnight incubation.
AB  - The BBL Crystal Enteric/Nonfermenter (Crystal, Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems) is a new multi-test identification system for Gram negative rods requiring no oil overlay or addition of reagents. One hundred and three selected Gram negative rod isolates from routine clinical specimens were tested in parallel using the appropriate API20E or API20NE (BioMerieux) reading after overnight incubation. The isolates included in the study, and the number tested, were as follows: Acinetobacter sp, 8; Aeromonas hydrophila, 1; Citrobacter diversus, 1; Citrobacter freundii, 1; Escherichia coli, 13; Enterobacter aerogenes, 10; Enterobacter agglomerans, 2; Enterobacter cloacae, 6; Klebsiella oxytoca, 6; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 12; Morganella morganii, 2; Proteus mirabilis, 6; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 21; Salmonella sp, 2; Salmonella typhi, 1; Serratia marcescens, 1; Shigella sonnei, 2; Shigella sp, 2; Vibrio metschnikovii, 1; Xanthomonas maltophilia, 3; and, Yersinia enterocolitica, 2. The API20E and API20NE systems combined identified 74.8% (77/103) and the Crystal 97.1% (100/103) of isolates. Twenty six isolates required repeat and/or additional tests for correct identification with the API systems compared to 3 with the Crystal. Crystal is more convenient than API for routine clinical use because it requires fewer repeat and/or extra tests, and is easier and less time consuming to use.
TI  - The danger of infections of the hospitalized patients with the microorganisms present in preparations and in the hospital environment.
AB  - Two strains-S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcus, resistant to antibiotics, were isolated from previously non-opened preparations made by the hospital pharmacy and industrially produced. After application in the surgery ward, two Enterobacter agglomerans strains, resistant to antibiotics were detected in oral mixtures. The resistant bacteria, B. cereus and 4 strains of Ps. aeruginosa, were also found in the purified water. In hospital environment 9 strains of staphylococci, resistant to the tested antibiotics were found. Only one of them was S. aureus (detected on the wall), the others being coagulase-negative staphylococci. Most of them were isolated from the floor, but also from the wall, table and from the air in surgical and ophthalmological wards and in the hospital pharmacy. The most dangerous were three Gram-negative strains resistant to all tested antibiotics. They were isolated from the floor (Enterobacter cloacae), from the wall (Proteus mirabilis) and from the container with oral mixture in infant ward (Ps. malthophilia). Many strains resistant to many antibiotics were detected on the floor of surgical, nephrological and infantile wards as well as from the pharmacies: Enterobacter cloacae (7 strains), Citrobacter freundi, Ps. aeruginosa, Ps. cepacia (2 strains), Ps. maltophilia (2 strains) and Moraxella. Many resistant strains were also present on the walls (E. coli, Ps. mirabilis, Ps. cepacia, Alcaligens, Acinetobacter). The resistant strains were rarely observed on the table, medical equipment and on personnel hands. Klebsiella oxytoca and Ps. paucimobilis were found on the table, Ps. maltophilia on the dropper and on the rim of the container with oral mixture. Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas sp. were isolated from the medicine glass, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas sp. from the personnel hands in the pharmacies.
TI  - Evaluation of RapID onE system for identification of 379 strains in the family Enterobacteriaceae and oxidase-negative, gram-negative nonfermenters.
AB  - The ability of the RapID onE system (Innovative Diagnostic Systems, Inc., Norcross, Ga.) to identify 364 strains in the family Enterobacteriaceae and 15 oxidase-negative, gram-negative, nonfermentative rods was evaluated. Kits were inoculated with no. 2 McFarland standard suspensions, and reactions were interpreted after 4 h of incubation at 35 degrees C. Overall, the method correctly identified (to the species level or to the genus level for salmonellas and non-Shigella sonnei Shigella species) 363 strains (95.8%) without additional tests. For four strains (1.0%), additional tests were required to delineate the correct identification from a range of two or more possibilities; these included one Serratia liquefaciens (Serratia marcescens or Serratia liquefaciens), one Serratia rubidaea (Serratia rubidaea or Serratia odorifera), one Salmonella typhi (Leminorella richardii or Salmonella sp.) and one Yersinia enterocolitica (Yersinia frederiksenii, Yersinia intermedia, or Yersinia enterocolitica). Twelve strains (3.2%) were misidentified or yielded codes with no identification; these comprised one Citrobacter amalonaticus (no identification), three Enterobacter hormaechei (not in the RapID onE database; two Enterobacter amnigenus, one Enterobacter sp.), one Serratia liquefaciens (Enterobacter cloacae), one Serratia rubidaea (no identification), four Serratia fonticola (not in RapID onE database; two Enterobacter aerogenes, one Serratia marcescens, one not identified), one Proteus mirabilis (Proteus penneri), and one Proteus vulgaris (Providencia rustigianii). If the seven strains not included in the database had been excluded, correct identification rates would have risen to 97.6% without additional tests and 98.7% with additional tests, with misidentification rates dropping to 1.3%. The RapID onE system is easy to set up and the results are easy to read, and the system provides an accurate, nonautomated commercially available method for the same-day identification of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and oxidase-negative, gram-negative nonfermenters.
TI  - Analysis of polar lipids from some representative enterobacteria, Plesiomonas and Acinetobacter by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry.
AB  - Fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (FAB-MS) was used to analyse lipid extracts of bacteria to assess its usefulness for analysing anionic phospholipids of potential chemotaxonomic value. The following micro-organisms were tested: Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae (2 strains), Escherichia coli (3 strains), Hafnia alvei, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Plesiomonas shigelloides, Proteus mirabilis (3 strains), Serratia liquefaciens and Serratia marcescens. Negative-ion spectra provide data for twenty-seven major carboxylate anions (m/z 209-325) and for thirty-seven major phospholipid anions (m/z 645-774). Generally, the largest carboxylate peaks were due to 16:1, 16:0, cyc17 and 18:1 while the largest phospholipid anion peaks were due to PE(32:1), PE(33:1), PE(34:1), PE(34:2), PG(30:2), PG(31:2), PG(32:2), PG(34:1) and PS(33:0). However, quantitative differences were observed. For example, Acinetobacter lacked PE (33:1) but had exceptionally high peaks at m/z 748, PS(33:0), and m/z 281, octadecanoate. Unknown 'carboxylate' peaks were detected at m/z 254, 256, 261, 268, 282 and 301. In some cases, unknown peaks appeared to constitute possible homologous series being separated by delta m/z of 14(identical to methylene). For chemotaxonomic purposes, the complexity of the data required numerical analysis. Using the Pearson coefficient of linear correlation, as a measure of association, it was possible to compare all strains analysed. Typical results for strain comparisons were as follows: Ent. cloacae vs Ent. cloacae, r = 0.90 (Ent. cloacae vs Ac. calcoaceticus, r = 0.46). Thus FAB-MS represents an excellent means of obtaining large quantities of data on polar lipids of a range of bacterial isolates, which may be suitable for chemotaxonomic purposes.
TI  - Antibody coated bacteria in urine of patients with recent spinal injury.
AB  - Twenty patients with an acute spinal injury were prospectively studied to assess  the clinical importance of antibody coated bacteria (ACB) in the urine and the association among the different bacterial species with a positive antibody coated bacteria test. Clinical urinary tract infection was associated with a positive ACB test on 45% of occasions. Three hundred and ninety nine urine samples containing 541 bacterial isolates were assessed for the presence of ACB; 13% were found to be positive and 87% negative for ACB; 67% of urines contained a single bacterial isolate. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was most commonly associated with clinical urinary tract infection, found in 25% of episodes, followed by Proteus mirabilis (17.5%), Klebsiella sp (12.5%), and Proteus morganii (10%). Providencia stuartii, however, was most commonly associated with a positive ACB test (found in 17%). Other bacteria associated with a positive ACB test included Klebsiella sp (14%), Acinetobacter sp (12.5%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12%), Citrobacter sp (11.5%). A positive ACB test is not to be expected from a patient with spinal injury who has a catheter in place, and the test may provide a useful guide to identify those patients with an invasive infection. It is doubtful that a decision to treat or not treat bacteriuria could rest on the identification of the bacterial species alone.
TI  - Hemolysin as a marker for Serratia.
AB  - All Serratia marcescens strains (total of 33) of different sources were hemolytic including clinical strains previously classified as being nonhemolytic. DNA fragments of the two hemolysin genes hybridized with the chromosomal DNA of S. marcescens, S. liquefaciens, S. kiliensis, S. grimesii, S. proteamaculans, S. plymutica, S. rubridaea which were also hemolytic. The restriction pattern of the hemolysin locus differed in each strain. S. ficaria and S. marinorubra expressed a different hemolysin which was much smaller than the S. marcescens hemolysin since it diffused through dialysis membranes. The DNA of the latter strains did not hybridize with the S. marcescens hemolysin DNA probes. Some S. marcescens strains, S. kiliensis and S. liquefaciens also expressed in addition the small hemolysin. No hybridization was found with DNA of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella arerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosus, Listeria sp., Aeromonas sp., Legionella sp. and a Meninococcus sp., indicating that the hemolysin DNA probes are specific for Serratia, or that the hemolysin genes occur rarely in genera other than Serratia.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigemonam against multiresistant nosocomial Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Tigemonam, an oral monobactam that exhibits beta-lactamase stability similar to that of aztreonam, was tested in vitro against 240 species of Enterobacteriaceae (50 Escherichia coli, 48 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 52 Enterobacter cloacae, 32 Proteus mirabilis, 22 Proteus indole-positive [Providencia sp.], 24 Serratia sp., and 12 Citrobacter sp. All strains were resistant to ampicillin and first-generation cephalosporins. In addition, 77.4% were resistant to amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, 46.8% to cefuroxime, 23.3% to ceftriaxone, 22.2% to aztreonam, 46.9% to cotrimoxazole, and 0.9% to norfloxacin. Tigemonam at a concentration of 4 micrograms/mL or less inhibited 72.7% of the strains with minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.03 or less to more than 512 micrograms/mL. The highest intrinsic activity was observed against Proteus sp. Tigemonam proved to be a bactericidal antibiotic. Cross-resistance was chiefly observed with aztreonam and ceftriaxone. It is concluded that tigemonam should play an important role in the treatment of nosocomial infections that do not require parenteral therapy and in the treatment of multiresistant community-acquired infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigemonam against urinary tract pathogens.
AB  - Tigemonam's in vitro activity was compared with that of aztreonam, cefotaxime, gentamicin, and norfloxacin. Thirty-two strains of Pseudomonas and 960 strains of Enterobacteriaceae were studied using the agar dilution method (including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter sp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, and Salmonella enterica). Tigemonam displayed good activity against Enterobacteriaceae. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), were as follows: MIC50S were 0.01 mg/L for P. mirabilis and 0.5 mg/L for S. marcescens, MIC90S were 0.03 mg/L for P. mirabilis and P. vulgaris and 4 mg/L for Citrobacter freundii. Tigemonam inhibited E. coli and P. mirabilis, the most common strains of urinary pathogens. Despite MIC90S of 9.5 and 4 mg/L for Enterobacter and C. freundii, respectively, resistance to tigemonam was observed. Tigemonam was found to be inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with MIC50S and MIC90S higher than 128 mg/L (range, 64 to greater than 128 mg/L). Tigemonam's activity was found to be similar to that of cefotaxime, slightly less than that of norfloxacin and aztreonam, and substantially greater than that of gentamicin. Of all the drugs tested, only norfloxacin and aztreonam possessed activity profiles against P. aeruginosa that were compatible with their clinical usefulness (MIC90, 8 mg/L for norfloxacin; MIC50, 8 mg/L and MIC90, 32 mg/L for aztreonam). Cefotaxime and gentamicin showed no activity on more than 90% of the P. aeruginosa strains tested.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of dactimicin in vitro compared with that of dibekacin, netilmicin, sisomicin and micronomicin.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of dactimicin, a pseudo-disaccharide aminoglycoside antibiotic, was compared with those of dibekacin, netilmicin, sisomicin and micronomicin using clinical isolates of four Gram-positive and sixteen Gram-negative bacteria. Dactimicin was more active than the reference amino-glycosides against Serratia marcescens, especially gentamicin-resistant Serratia sp., Proteus vulgaris, P. rettgeri and Klebsiella oxytoca, but less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and P. mirabilis. Dactimicin was equally active as the references excepting netilmicin against Gram-positive bacteria and some Gram-negative bacteria including Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogens, E. cloacae, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Campylobacter jejunii. Dactimicin was active against resistant strains possessing various aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes including AAC(3)-1, by which dactimicin was acetylated.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. Focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in Japan between May, 1985 through March, 1986. These tests were organized by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. This paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and Campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (OFLX) and conventional antibacterial drugs. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. OFLX showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, C. freundii, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and C. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to OFLX. Moreover, OFLX has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. When studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, OFLX occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. Almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
TI  - [Demonstration of glycocalyx formation in vitro in Citrobacter freundii, Proteus  mirabilis and Planococcus sp.: the effect of polyosidases].
AB  - Three bacterial species of different origin, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis and Planococcus sp., formed glycocalyx in vitro and thereby showed that the phenomena does not only occur in vivo contrary to the opinion of many authors. The glycocalyx was produced in the attachment processes used or both extra- and intercellular attachment. The aggregates formed caused large errors in bacterial counts and led to questioning of the very principle of the counting procedures. The glycocalyx was not destroyed by the polyosidases utilized nor by ultrasound treatment. The glycocalyx structure differed only according to the bacterial species of origin and was unchanged by culture media or nutrient deprivation.
TI  - In vitro study of the antibacterial activity of ofloxacin against recent clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ofloxacin, a new broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, was studied by a standardized single disc method. A total of 990 clinical isolates were tested, including 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria. Ofloxacin was highly active against 683 strains (70.41%), had intermediate activity against 109 (11.23%) and had no activity against 178 (18.35%). Ofloxacin was highly active against E. coli, Klebsiella sp., Citrobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Salmonella sp., Campylobacter jejuni, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Eubacterium sp., Propionibacterium acnes and Streptococcus sp. Pseudomonas sp., Serratia sp. and Proteus vulgaris had percentages of resistance to ofloxacin of 37.11%, 32% and 33.33% respectively. High percentages of resistance to ofloxacin were found only for Providencia sp., Proteus rettgeri and Bacteroides fragilis. With regard to Streptococcus faecalis, the results obtained with the disc procedure were not reliable and MIC determination was necessary to assess the behaviour of the drug.
TI  - [Treatment of urinary infection with cephadroxyl (Pharmachem)--microbiological and clinical research].
AB  - The bacteria isolated from the urine of renal patients were tested for sensitivity towards cephadroxyl (Pharmachem) and other beta-lactam antibiotics--altogether 654 examinations were made. It was established that the gram-positive bacteria (excluding the Enterococcus) are sensitive towards cephadroxyl. From the Gram negative bacteria E. Coli, Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp., P. mirabilis, Citrobacter sp. showed the greatest sensitivity towards cephadroxyl, while the indole positive Proteus were with low sensitivity and P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter sp., Serratia were resistant towards cephadroxyl. 30 patients with persistent mainly secondary urinary infection were treated with cephadroxyl. The clinical symptoms disappeared in 63.3% of the patients and another 26.7% of them showed considerable improvement. Bacteriological sterility of the urine was achieved in 61.29% of the patients. The side effects were mild and rare, only in single cases.
TI  - Use of aztreonam in patients suffering from urinary tract infections with contraindications for the use of aminoglycosides.
AB  - The clinical efficacy and safety of aztreonam were studied in 30 patients suffering from urinary tract infections caused by gram-negative bacteria. Aztreonam was given in a dose of 1 g i.m. at intervals of 12 or 24 hours. Duration of therapy was 2-8 days. Bacteria isolated in urine cultures were: Escherichia coli (60%); Proteus mirabilis (10%); Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Citrobacter sp. (7%); Proteus vulgaris, Serratia marcescens; Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas species (3%). At completion of therapy and at follow-up all patients were bacteriologically and clinically cured. No significant side effects or toxicity were observed in all patients treated. It is concluded from these data that aztreonam is highly effective and well tolerated in patients affected either by upper or lower urinary tract infections.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of cephem antibiotics against isolates from clinical specimens at the Yokohama City University Hospital].
AB  - Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cephem antibiotics against 405 strains belonging to 17 species of clinical isolates were investigated using the standard method of the Japanese Congress of Chemotherapy. The results obtained are summarized below. Cephem antibiotics showed weak antibacterial activities against Enterococcus sp., B. fragilis and S. marcescens. S. pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis were susceptible to cephem antibiotics. Cephem antibiotics of the 1st and the 2nd generations showed weak antibacterial activity against Citrobacter sp. and E. cloacae, while cephem antibiotics of 3rd generation had a good antibacterial activity against these species. Cephem antibiotics of the 2nd and the 3rd generations showed high antibacterial activity against H. influenzae and indole positive Proteus group. Cefoperazone showed high antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa. Resistance to latamoxef, ceftizoxime and cefoxitin was observed among Staphylococcus sp., while the MICs of other antibiotics against Staphylococcus sp. were fairly low. Number of strains resistant to the 3rd cephem antibiotics seems to be increasing because the 3rd generation of cephem antibiotics have been used frequently. Further investigation will be required on resistant organism to these antibiotics including beta-lactamase producing strains.
TI  - [In vitro activity of a new 3d-generation cephalosporin, cefodizime, on hospital  bacteria].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cefodizime were evaluated by agar dilution for 746 bacterial strains isolated in two hospitals. For enterobacteriaceae MICs ranged from 0.008 micrograms/ml to more than 128 micrograms/ml (mode MIC: 0.25); mode MICs varied across species, ranging from 0.016 micrograms/ml for Proteus mirabilis to 1 microgram/ml for Citrobacter; MICs ranged from 0.12 to 8 for most Enterobacter and from 1 to 64 for Serratia. The rare cefotaxime-resistant strains, most of which were Citrobacter or Enterobacter, also showed resistance to cefodizime. Cefodizime was noticeably less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter, with MICs ranging from 32 to more than 128. Haemophilus sp. and Gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status, as well as Neisseria meningitidis, were highly susceptible (MIC less than or equal to 0.008-0.016). Cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococci (MIC: 2 to 16 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. Enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant. Whereas the other Streptococci and Pneumococci had low MICs (0.03-0.12). A fairly wide range of MICs was found for anaerobes, with lower values for Clostridium (0.008 to 1) than for Bacteroids (8 to 128 mu g/ml). Our results show that cefodizime has the same properties as other third-generation cephalosporins: cefotaxime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae strains also exhibit resistance to cefodizime.
TI  - In vitro activity of aztreonam against gram negative bacteria from clinical specimens and its comparison with other commonly used antibiotics.
AB  - A total of 755 gram negative bacteria isolated from clinical specimens were tested against aztreonam by the disc agar diffusion test. The strains of bacteria used in this study consisted of Escherichia coli (314), Enterobacter aerogenes (30), E. agglomerans (7), E. cloacae, (39), Citrobacter diversus (9), C. freundii (13), Hafnia alvei (3), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (10), Klebsiella oxytoca (6), K. ozaenae (5), K. pneumoniae (107), Morganella morganii (3), Moraxella sp. (10), Pasteurella multocida (1), Proteus mirabilis (66), P. vulgaris (4), Providencia rettgeri (12), P. stuartii (5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (85), P. fluorescens (2), P. maltophila (7), Salmonella sp. (1) and Serratia marcescens (17). In vitro activity against aztreonam was compared with amikacin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalosporin, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, piperacillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and tobramycin. Over 99% of E. coli and Enterobacter species were susceptible to aztreonam. All the 118 strains of Klebsiella, 87 strains of Proteus-Providencia and 17 strains of S. marcescens were also susceptible. Aztreonam also showed good activity against P. aeruginosa, inhibiting 90% of the 85 isolates tested.
TI  - In-vitro activity of ofloxacin, a quinolone carboxylic acid compared to other quinolones and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Ofloxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid compound. Its activity against 900 bacterial isolates was determined. It inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Aeromonas hydrophila, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, Yersinia enterocolitica at less than or equal to 0.8 mg/l. Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus sp., Neisseria sp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.1 mg/l. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Pseudomonas species were inhibited by less than or equal to 6.3 mg/l. Although most staphylococcal species, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci were inhibited by 3.1 mg/l, many streptococcal species had higher MIC values, and most Bacteroides species were inhibited at less than or equal to 6.3 mg/l. The overall activity of ofloxacin was similar to enoxacin and norfloxacin. Ofloxacin inhibited organisms resistant to nalidixic acid, ampicillin, cephalexin, piperacillin, and gentamicin including Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime. The activity of ofloxacin was lower at an acid pH and in urine, but serum had no effect on MICs or MBCs. Increase in ofloxacin MICs for various bacteria could be achieved by repeated subculture in the presence of ofloxacin.
TI  - [In vitro activity of ceftriaxone on hospital bacteria. Results of a multicenter  study].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ceftriaxone were determined by agar dilution for 2 099 strains isolated in six teaching hospitals. MICs were less than 1 microgram/ml for the great majority of Enterobacteriaceae, with mode MICs varying across groups from less than 0.008 micrograms/ml for Proteus (mirabilis and indole-positive) to 0.25 for Enterobacter. Only a few resistant strains were found, mainly among Enterobacter and Citrobacter. Ceftriaxone proved noticeably less active against P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter (mode MICs: 16 micrograms/ml). Haemophilus sp. and Gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase production status, as well as Neisseria meningitidis, were highly susceptible (MIC less than 0.008-0.032). Ceftriaxone was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC: 2 to 8 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin resistant strains. Enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant, whereas the other Streptococci and Pneumococci had low MICs (0.03-0.25). A fairly wide range of MICs was found for anaerobes (Clostridium: 0.06-2, Bacteroides: 0.5-32). Our data show that its particularly strong activity against Proteus, Haemophilus and Neisseria sets ceftriaxone apart from the other third-generation cephalosporins.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on cefminox].
AB  - Laboratory and clinical studies were performed on cefminox (CMNX, MT-141), a new  cephamycin antibiotic, and results were as follows. Antimicrobial activities. MICs of CMNX against various clinical isolates were determined with the inoculum size of 10(6) cells/ml. Percentages of strains susceptible to 12.5 micrograms/ml or less were 4% for S. aureus, 0% for E. faecalis, 100% for E. coli, 81% for K. pneumoniae, 3% for Enterobacter sp., 18% for S. marcescens, 90% for P. mirabilis, 88% for indole-positive Proteus sp. 100% for S. flexneri, 100% for Salmonella sp., 0% for Citrobacter sp. and 0% for P. aeruginosa. Most of those sensitive strains were inhibited by 0.39-0.78 microgram/ml. These activities were better than those of cefmetazole and cefazolin, but were not as good as those of cefoperazone. Clinical efficacy Three patients with pneumonia, 1 with pneumonia and sepsis, and 1 with urinary tract infection were treated with CMNX daily dose of 1-4 g for 7-31 days. Clinical responses were excellent in 1, good in 3, poor in 2 patients (contained a double case). Bacteriological effects were good for E. coli, K. pneumoniae and S. liquefaciens, poor for P. aeruginosa and P. mirabilis. C. freundii, A. calcoaceticus and E. faecalis were cultured after treatment. No side effect and no abnormal change of laboratory findings were seen in our cases.
TI  - [Fundamental and clinical studies of sulbactam/cefoperazone in the pediatric field].
AB  - To 6 cases of children in 2 groups of 3 each, newly developed sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ) was given at 20 and 40 mg/kg by intravenous bolus injection, respectively, and the serum and urinary concentrations and recoveries of SBT and CPZ were determined. To 1 case of purulent meningitis, this drug was given at 40 mg/kg by intravenous bolus injection, and the cerebrospinal fluid and serum concentrations of SBT and CPZ were determined. Susceptibility tests to SBT/CPZ and CPZ of total 289 strains were conducted; Gram-positive cocci tested consisted of 26 S. aureus strains, 20 S. pyogenes strains and 21 S. pneumoniae strains, and Gram-negative bacilli consisted of 24 H. influenzae strains, 22 E. coli strains, 26 K. pneumoniae strains, 24 E. cloacae strains, 21 E. aerogenes strains, 19 Citrobacter sp. strains, 20 S. marcescens strains, 23 P. mirabilis strains, 23 indole-positive Proteus sp. strains and 20 P. aeruginosa strains. SBT/CPZ was given to total 43 cases at a mean daily dosage of 80.4 mg/kg, in 3 or 4 divided doses (6 cases in 3 and 37 cases in 4), 1 case receiving the drug by drip infusion over 30 minutes (in 3 divided doses) and all the other 42 cases by intravenous bolus injection, for 7 days on an average. They consisted of 2 cases of tonsillitis, 1 case of otitis media, 1 case of otitis media associated with mastoiditis, 30 cases of pneumonia, 1 case of suspected septicemia, 1 case of purulent meningitis, 5 cases of urinary tract infection, 1 case of purulent lymphadenitis and 1 case of submaxillaritis. And the clinical and bacteriological effects were evaluated. Also, side reactions and laboratory examinations for abnormal values due to administration of this drug were made on 47 cases including 4 drop-outs. The following results were obtained: After administration of this drug to 2 groups of 3 children each at 20 and 40 mg/kg by intravenous bolus injection, mean serum concentrations of both SBT and CPZ reached the peaks in 5 minutes; SBT levels were 60.9 and 124.7 micrograms/ml for the 2 groups and CPZ levels were 105.0 and 214.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. In either group, CPZ levels were 1.7 times as high as SBT levels, and there was observed a dose-response in both. In the 20 mg/kg group, mean half-lives of SBT and CPZ were 0.96 and 1.24 hours, respectively, and in the 40 mg/kg group, they were 1.01 and 1.32 hours, CPZ values tending to be longer.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Sensitivity to fosfomycin of bacteria isolated at the Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital in 1982 and 1983].
AB  - Susceptibility of 16 056 strains isolated in 1982 and 1983 to fosfomycin (FOS) was tested with Mueller-Hinton medium and discs 50 micrograms FOS + 25 micrograms glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) (cutoff diameter 14 mm). For 3 411 strains, inhibition zone diameters were recorded. Almost all E. coli, Citrobacter, Salmonella and S. aureus were susceptible to FOS as well as 70% of Serratia, E. cloacae, P. mirabilis and 50% of Klebsiella and Enterobacter sp. Only 27% of P. aeruginosa, 20% of indole positive Proteus and 8% of Acinetobacter were sensitive to FOS. E. coli, Citrobacter and S. aureus seem to exhibit the highest susceptibilities to FOS. Sensitivity rates of E. cloacae, Serratia, P. aeruginosa, and especially Klebsiella seemed slightly underestimated by the disk diffusion method, but differentiation between susceptible and resistant strains was facilitated by rating as susceptible those strains with inhibition zone diameters between 12 and 14 mm. This method also seemed to underrate the sensitivity of susceptible Enterobacteriaceae, probably because of inadequate G6P concentrations at this point of the disk.
TI  - Efficacy of ceftizoxime administered twice daily in hospitalized patients with respiratory tract infections.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of ceftizoxime administered twice daily were evaluated in 215 hospitalized patients with documented lower respiratory tract infections. The majority of patients received 1 to 2 gm of ceftizoxime intramuscularly or intravenously every 12 hours; the mean dosage was 2 gm/day, and the mean duration of therapy was 8.9 days. Clinical cure was achieved in 204 (95%) of the 215 patients with lower respiratory tract infection. One hundred and thirty-eight patients were both clinically and bacteriologically evaluable. The clinical response rates, by organism, were: Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100% (50/50); Haemophilus influenzae, 96% (25/26); gram-negative bacilli (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter sp, Serratia sp, Pseudomonas sp, Klebsiella sp, Citrobacter sp, and Morganella morganii), 86% (32/37); and Staphylococcus aureus, 92% (12/13). In the other 77 patients with clinical symptoms, no pathogen was isolated or insufficient follow-up data were collected to assess bacteriologic response. Adverse reactions, which were infrequent, were similar to those reported in other US trials of the drug. The findings indicate that ceftizoxime, 1 to 2 gm BID, is effective and safe in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections in hospitalized patients. This low-dose regimen can significantly reduce the cost of cephalosporin therapy.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of aztreonam: a synthetic monobactam. A comparative study  with thirteen other antibiotics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of aztreoman (SQ 26, 776), a new monocyclic beta-lactam antimicrobial agent, was determined against 1720 bacteria, all clinical isolates, and compared with that of thirteen beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics. Aztreonam inhibited 90% of Citrobacter diversus, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter agglomerans, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Proteus vulgaris and Salmonella sp. by less than or equal to 0.4 micrograms ml-1. This activity was superior to moxalactam, piperacillin, cefamandole, cefoperazone, cefoxitin, cefsulodin, ceftazidime and aminoglycoside antibiotics. Aztreonam was as active as moxalactam against Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae and Shigella species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains resistant to moxalactam, piperacillin, cefamandole, cefoperazone, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, cefsulodin and ceftazidime were inhibited by aztreonam 50% by 6.3 micrograms ml-1 and 90% by 16 micrograms ml-1. Aztreonam was as active as ceftazidime against Serratia marcescens, all strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms ml-1 and 90% by 1.6 micrograms ml-1. There was no major difference between MBC and MIC values of aztreonam and the effect of inoculum size upon MIC values was observed at 10(7) CFU.
TI  - In vitro activity of norfloxacin, a quinolinecarboxylic acid, compared with that  of beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  - Norfloxacin is a quinolinecarboxylic acid compound. We examined the in vitro activity of this compound against gram-positive and -negative species, including anaerobic species. It inhibited 90% (MIC90) of strains of Escherichia coli at 0.05 microgram/ml, Klebsiella sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, Salmonella and Shigella spp. at 0.1 microgram/ml, Citrobacter sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, Enterobacter cloacae at 0.2 microgram/ml, Enterobacter aerogenes at 0.4 microgram/ml, and Enterobacter agglomerans at 0.2 microgram/ml. The MICs of Proteus mirabilis, Morganella sp., Proteus vulgaris, Proteus rettgeri, and Providencia sp. were 0.1, 0.2, 0.8, 0.3, and 1.6 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 of Serratia sp. was 1.6 micrograms/ml, and that of Acinetobacter sp. was 6.3 micrograms/ml. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa the MIC50, the MIC75, and the MIC90 were 0.8, 1.6, and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC50 of Pseudomonas maltophilia was 3.1 micrograms/ml, and the MIC90 was 12.5 micrograms/ml. Yersinia, Arizona, and Aeromonas all were inhibited at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml, as was Campylobacter. The activity of the compound against gram-positive species was less impressive: the MIC90s of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus faecalis were 1.6, 6.3, 3.1, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. All Listeria strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml. The activity of norfloxacine was not affected by the type of medium, pH, or inoculum size. There was no major difference between MIC and minimum bactericidal concentration values. Norfloxacin inhibited bacteria in every species which was resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim at concentrations lower than those of aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, moxalactam, and aminoglycosides.
TI  - Homology of the gene coding for outer membrane lipoprotein within various Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The mRNA for a major outer membrane lipoprotein from Escherichia coli was found to hybridize specifically with one of the EcoRI and one of the HindIII restriction endonuclease-generated fragments of total DNA from nine bacteria in the family Enterobacteriaceae: E. coli, Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella typhimurium, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter aerogenes, Edwardsiella tarda, Serratia marcescens, and Erwinia amylovora. However, among the Enterobacteriaceae, DNA from two species of Proteus (P. mirabilis and P. morganii) did not contain any restriction endonuclease fragments that hybridized with the E. coli lipoprotein mRNA. Furthermore, no hybrid bands were detected in four other gram-negative bacteria outside the family Enterobacteriaceae: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter sp. HO1-N, Caulobacter crescentus, and Myxococcus xanthus. Envelope fractions from all bacteria in the family Enterobacteriaceae tested above cross-reacted with antiserum against the purified E. coli free-form lipoprotein in the Ouchterlony immunodiffusion test. Both species of Proteus, however, gave considerably weaker precipitation lines, in comparison with the intense lines produced by the other members of the family. All of the above four bacteria outside the family Enterobacteriaceae did not cross-react with anti-E. coli lipoprotein serum. From these results, the rate of evolutionary changes in the lipoprotein gene seems to be closely related to that observed for various soluble enzymes of the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Combined activitiy of clavulanic acid and ticarcillin against ticarcillin-resistant, gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - Fifty-one clinical isolates of ticarcillin-resistant, gram-negative bacilli were  tested for susceptibility to combinations of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid (BRL 14151), a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were measured by a microdilution method, and minimal bactericidal concentrations for selected strains were measured by the broth dilution method. Ticarcillin MICs were >/=128 mug/ml for all and >/=512 mug/ml for 38 (75%) of the strains. Thirty-nine strains of Enterobacteriaceae tested included Escherichia coli (14), Klebsiella pneumoniae (16), Citrobacter sp. (3), Enterobacter sp. (3), Salmonella enteritidis (1), Serratia marcescens (1), and Proteus mirabilis (1). Ticarcillin MICs for 34 strains (88%) were lowered at least threefold by the addition of 1.0 mug of clavulanic acid per ml. Against 33 strains (85%), the MICs were 64 mug or less per ml in the presence of 5 mug of clavulanic acid per ml. In contrast, the MICs for seven of eight strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were unaffected by the addition of up to 10 mug of clavulanic acid per ml. Ticarcillin with 5 mug of clavulanic acid per ml was bactericidal against ticarcillin-resistant (MIC >/= 2,048 mug/ml) E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Enterobacter, and P. mirabilis.
TI  - Biological values of the infant, juvenile, and adult agouti (Dasyprocta sp) with  emphasis on microbial flora.
AB  - Normal values for intestinal flora were determined on four adult, two juvenile, and four infant agoutis (Dasyprocta sp) maintained at our institution. Serologic, hematologic, biochemical, and histologic observations were also made on these same agoutis, and serologic, microbiologic, and endoparasitic tests were made on serum and fecal samples from agoutis maintained at other institutions. Streptococci, lactobacilli and nonenteropathogenic Escherichia coli were isolated from cecal contents of all age groups. Gaffkya tetragena and Bacillus sp were recovered from infant agoutis, Proteus mirabilis from juvenile agoutis, and Proteus mirabilis and Micrococcus sp from adult agoutis. Infant agoutis showed marginal antibody titers to reovirus type 3 and Toolan's H-1 viruses, and Theiler's GDVII antibodies were detected in juvenile agoutis, but no antibody titers to murine viruses were found in the adult agoutis maintained at our institution. Hematologic, biochemical, and histologic data for these agoutis were comparable to those of other hystricomorph rodents. Serologic tests of the agoutis maintained at other institutions disclosed antibodies for GDVII virus in all of 17 animals tested, while marginal titers were found for Sendai virus in four and for reovirus type 3 in eight of the 17 animals. Only low incidences of pathogenic bacteria (Salmonella, Pseudomonas, and Citrobacter) were isolated from the agoutis maintained elsewhere. The endoparasites found in these agoutis were Ascaris, Toxascaris, Strongyloides, Trichuris, and Trichomonas.
TI  - [In vitro examination on antibacterial activities of broad-spectrum antibiotics against gram-negative clinical isolates (author's transl)].
AB  - In vitro studies were undertaken on clinically isolated strains of various bacteria to examine the antibacterial activity of ampicillin (AB-PC), carbenicillin (CB-PC), sulbenicillin (SB-PC) cephalothin (CET), cefazolin (CEZ) and gentamicin (GM). Fifty three % of Escherichia coli strains 53.3% of Citrobacter sp., 80% of Proteus mirabilis, 42.9% of Morganella and 80% of Bacteroides sp. were susceptible (MIC being not higher than 12.5 mug/ml) to AB-PC. The eight other species were not so susceptible to this penicillin. CB-PC and SB-PC were almost as effective as AB-PC against Escherichia coli and Citrobacter sp. They were less active against Klebsiella sp., but more active against Enterobacter sp., Serratia sp., indole-positive Proteus group and Pseudomonas sp. than AB-PC, SB-PC was more effective than CB-PC against Pseudomonas sp. The strains of Pseudomonas sp. which were resistant to higher concentrations of CB-PC and SB-PC were pyocyanine-negative strains. All strains (100%) of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp. and Citrobacter sp. were susceptible to CET and CEZ, while none of Enterobacter sp. , Serratia sp., Proteus vulgaris. Morganella, Rettgerella, Providencia and Pseudomonas sp. were susceptible to these cephalosporins. The MICs of CET and CEZ against Bacteroides sp. were moderately low. Some strains of Providencia and Alkaligenes sp. were resistant of GM but the other 10 species were not resistant to this antibiotic, though it showed comparatively high MICs against Bacteroides sp. When seen from the MIC distribution of each antibiotic, there was a tendency that the strains isolated from the pus were more resistant than those isolated from the other sources (urine, sputum and bile).
TI  - Susceptibility of clinical isolates of bacteria to cefoxitin and cephalothin.
AB  - The susceptibility of 4,929 unselected clinical isolates of bacteria to cefoxitin and cephalothin was determined by the single-disk method, using a computer-associated electronic zone analyzer to obtain, record, and process measurements of sizes of zones of inhibition. Both cefoxitin and cephalothin were effective against most gram-positive strains, including Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, micrococci, and all streptococci except enterococci. The three strains of Listeria monocytogenes tested were susceptible to cephalothin but resistant to cefoxitin. There was little difference between the cefoxitin and cephalothin susceptibility of Salmonellae, Citrobacter sp., Enterobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas sp. Cefoxitin was more effective then cephalothin against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Serratia sp., indole-positive Proteus sp., Providence sp., Flavobacter sp., Herellea vaginicola, and Mima polymorpha. Cefoxitin also appeared to exhibit enhanced activity, as compared with cephalothin, against Bacteroides sp. Thus cefoxitin appears to have a very broad antibacterial spectrum which is greater than that of cephalothin, especially against gram-negative strains.
