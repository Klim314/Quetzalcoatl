TI  - Rewiring Lactococcus lactis for ethanol production.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are known for their high tolerance toward organic acids and alcohols (R. S. Gold, M. M. Meagher, R. Hutkins, and T. Conway, J. Ind. Microbiol. 10:45-54, 1992) and could potentially serve as platform organisms for production of these compounds. In this study, we attempted to redirect the metabolism of LAB model organism Lactococcus lactis toward ethanol production. Codon-optimized Zymomonas mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) was introduced and expressed from synthetic promoters in different strain backgrounds. In the wild-type L. lactis strain MG1363 growing on glucose, only small amounts of ethanol were obtained after introducing PDC, probably due to a low native alcohol dehydrogenase activity. When the same strains were grown on maltose, ethanol was the major product and lesser amounts of lactate, formate, and acetate were formed. Inactivating the lactate dehydrogenase genes ldhX, ldhB, and ldh and introducing codon-optimized Z. mobilis alcohol dehydrogenase (ADHB) in addition to PDC resulted in high-yield ethanol formation when strains were grown on glucose, with only minor amounts of by-products formed. Finally, a strain with ethanol as the sole observed fermentation product was obtained by further inactivating the phosphotransacetylase (PTA) and the native alcohol dehydrogenase (ADHE).
TI  - Thermophilic Bacillus coagulans requires less cellulases for simultaneous saccharification and fermentation of cellulose to products than mesophilic microbial biocatalysts.
AB  - Ethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass depends on simultaneous saccharification of cellulose to glucose by fungal cellulases and fermentation of glucose to ethanol by microbial biocatalysts (SSF). The cost of cellulase enzymes represents a significant challenge for the commercial conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into renewable chemicals such as ethanol and monomers for plastics. The cellulase concentration for optimum SSF of crystalline cellulose with fungal enzymes and a moderate thermophile, Bacillus coagulans, was determined to be about 7.5 FPU g(-1) cellulose. This is about three times lower than the amount of cellulase required for SSF with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Zymomonas mobilis, or Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis whose growth and fermentation temperature optimum is significantly lower than that of the fungal cellulase activity. In addition, B. coagulans also converted about 80% of the theoretical yield of products from 40 g/L of crystalline cellulose in about 48 h of SSF with 10 FPU g(-1) cellulose while yeast, during the same period, only produced about 50% of the highest yield produced at end of 7 days of SSF. These results show that a match in the temperature optima for cellulase activity and fermentation is essential for decreasing the cost of cellulase in cellulosic ethanol production.
TI  - Analysis of bacterial community during the fermentation of pulque, a traditional  Mexican alcoholic beverage, using a polyphasic approach.
AB  - In this study, the characterization of the bacterial community present during the fermentation of pulque, a traditional Mexican alcoholic beverage from maguey (Agave), was determined for the first time by a polyphasic approach in which both culture and non-culture dependent methods were utilized. The work included the isolation of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), aerobic mesophiles, and 16S rDNA clone libraries from total DNA extracted from the maguey sap (aguamiel) used as substrate, after inoculation with a sample of previously produced pulque and followed by 6-h fermentation. Microbiological diversity results were correlated with fermentation process parameters such as sucrose, glucose, fructose and fermentation product concentrations. In addition, medium rheological behavior analysis and scanning electron microscopy in aguamiel and during pulque fermentation were also performed. Our results showed that both culture and non-culture dependent approaches allowed the detection of several new and previously reported species within the alpha-, gamma-Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. Bacteria diversity in aguamiel was composed by the heterofermentative Leuconostoc citreum, L. mesenteroides, L. kimchi, the gamma-Proteobacteria Erwinia rhapontici, Enterobacter spp. and Acinetobacter radioresistens. Inoculation with previously fermented pulque incorporated to the system microbiota, homofermentative lactobacilli related to Lactobacillus acidophilus, several alpha-Proteobacteria such as Zymomonas mobilis and Acetobacter malorum, other gamma-Proteobacteria and an important amount of yeasts, creating a starting metabolic diversity composed by homofermentative and heterofermentative LAB, acetic and ethanol producing microorganisms. At the end of the fermentation process, the bacterial diversity was mainly composed by the homofermentative Lactobacillus acidophilus, the heterofermentative L. mesenteroides, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and the alpha-Proteobacteria A. malorum. After a 6-h fermentation, 83.27% of total sugars detected after inoculation were consumed (228.4 mM hexose equivalents) and a carbon (C) recovery of 66.18% in fermentation products was estimated. They were produced 284.4 mM C as ethanol, 71.5 mM C as acetic acid and 19 mM C as lactic acid, demonstrating the presence of homo- and heterofermentative, acetic and alcoholic metabolisms in the final product. It was also found, after hydrolysis, that the exopolysaccharide produced during the fermentation was mainly composed by fructose residues, probably inulin or levan.
TI  - High-level acetaldehyde production in Lactococcus lactis by metabolic engineering.
AB  - Efficient conversion of glucose to acetaldehyde is achieved by nisin-controlled overexpression of Zymomonas mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc) and Lactococcus lactis NADH oxidase (nox) in L. lactis. In resting cells, almost 50% of the glucose consumed could be redirected towards acetaldehyde by combined overexpression of pdc and nox under anaerobic conditions.
TI  - Engineering lactic acid bacteria with pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase genes for ethanol production from Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria are candidates for engineered production of ethanol from biomass because they are food-grade microorganisms that can, in many cases, metabolize a variety of sugars and grow under harsh conditions. In an effort to divert fermentation from production of lactic acid to ethanol, plasmids were constructed to express pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), encoded by the pdc and adhB genes of Zymomonas mobilis, in lactic acid bacteria. Several strains were transformed with the plasmids, and transcription of pdc and adhB was confirmed by northern hybridization analysis of transformants. PDC and ADH enzyme activities were at least 5- to 10-fold lower in these bacteria compared to Escherichia coli transformed with the same plasmid. Glucose fermentations were carried out, and some, but not all, of the transformed strains produced more ethanol than the untransformed parent strains. However, lactic acid was the primary fermentation product formed by all of the transformants, indicating that ADH and PDC activities were insufficient to divert significant carbon flow towards ethanol.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the Zymomonas mobilis "production of ethanol" genes in  Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - This study describes the expression of the Zymomonas mobilis genes coding for pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc) and alcohol dehydrogenase (adh) in Lactobacillus casei 686. To promote transcription, the promoter and ribosome binding site (RBS) from the Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis-derived vector, pMGE36e, were inserted upstream of the pdc gene. The former sequences were positioned such that translation of pdc was coupled to translation of an 81-base pair open reading frame terminating within the pdc initiation site. The recombinant plasmid (pRSG02) was electroporated into L. casei, and transformants were obtained. Northern analysis confirmed the production of a 3. 1-kb transcript corresponding to the predicted size of the PET operon. Western blot analyses revealed that the recombinant strain expressed both enzymes. The recombinant produced more than twice the ethanol produced by the parental L. casei strain.
