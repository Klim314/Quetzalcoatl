TI  - Relapse of polymicrobial endocarditis in an intravenous drug user.
AB  - A 26-year-old male intravenous drug user (IDU) presented twice within 6 months with relapsed polymicrobial infective endocarditis (IE) due to Eikenella corrodens and Streptococcus constellatus after completing two courses of appropriate antimicrobial therapy. This report points to relapsing endocarditis as a clinical entity that warrants attention in IDUs when E. corrodens or S. constellatus are causative agents of IE.
TI  - Microbiota of the dorsum of the tongue after plaque accumulation: an experimental study in humans.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect  of the absence of tongue hygiene on the microbiota of the dorsum of the tongue. METHODS: Ten volunteers (aged 19 to 22 years) entered the study at baseline and were instructed to abstain from tongue cleaning for 7 days, followed by a period of 3 days without any kind of oral hygiene. Subsequently, a period of 21 days of washout was employed, and this protocol was repeated three times. Microbiological samples were obtained from the dorsum of the tongue at baseline and at the end of the period of coating accumulation and analyzed using the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique. RESULTS: The species found in highest mean counts at baseline and day 10 were Prevotella melaninogenica and Veillonella parvula. The mean bacterial total counts enhanced significantly during the study (from 17.1x10(6) to 33.7x10(6)). Proportions of red and blue complexes and levels of 18 species also increased after the period of coating accumulation, including several periodontal pathogens, such as Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Streptococcus constellatus, Tannerella forsythensis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, and P. melaninogenica. CONCLUSION: The tongue surface could be an important reservoir for periodontal pathogens and may play a role in the recolonization of tooth surfaces and in the etiology of oral halitosis.
TI  - Distribution of selected bacterial species on intraoral surfaces.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: To examine the proportions of 40 bacterial species in samples from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces and saliva in systemically healthy adult subjects and to compare these microbiotas with those of supra- and subgingival plaque. METHODS: Microbial samples were taken from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces of 225 systemically healthy subjects using a "buccal brush". Saliva was taken by expectoration. Forty-four of these subjects provided additional supra- and subgingival plaque samples. Samples were individually evaluated for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. The percentage of total DNA probe count was determined for each species, at each sample location and averaged across subjects. The significance of differences among the proportions of the 40 test species at different sample locations was sought in the 225 and 44 subjects separately using the Quade test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. Cluster analysis was performed using the proportions of the 40 species at the different sample locations using the minimum similarity coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. The proportions of each species were averaged across subjects in the resulting cluster groups and the significance of differences was tested using the t-test and ANOVA. RESULTS: Microbial profiles differed markedly among sample locations in the 225 subjects, with 34 of 40 species differing significantly. Proportions of Veillonella parvula and Prevotella melaninogenica were higher in saliva and on the lateral and dorsal surfaces of the tongue, while Streptococcus mitis and S. oralis were in significantly lower proportions in saliva and on the tongue dorsum. Cluster analysis resulted in the formation of 2 clusters with >85% similarity. Cluster 1 comprised saliva, lateral and dorsal tongue surfaces, while Cluster 2 comprised the remaining soft tissue locations. V. parvula, P. melaninogenica, Eikenella corrodens, Neisseria mucosa, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Fusobacterium periodonticum, F. nucleatum ss vincentii and Porphyromonas gingivalis were in significantly higher proportions in Cluster 1 and S. mitis, S. oralis and S. noxia were significantly higher in Cluster 2. These findings were confirmed using data from the 44 subjects providing plaque samples. The microbial profiles of supra- and subgingival plaque differed from the other sample locations, particularly in the increased proportions of the Actinomyces species. Species of different genera exhibited different proportions on the various intraoral surfaces, but even within the genus Streptococcus, there were differences in colonization patterns. S. oralis, S. mitis and S. constellatus colonized the soft tissues and saliva in higher proportions than the samples from the teeth, while the other 4 streptococcal species examined colonized the dental surfaces in proportions comparable to the soft tissue locations and saliva. CONCLUSIONS: Proportions of bacterial species differed markedly on different intraoral surfaces. The microbiota of saliva was most similar to that of the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the tongue. The microbiotas of the soft tissues resembled each other more than the microbiotas that colonized the teeth both above and below the gingival margin.
TI  - [Acute subdural abscess due to mixed infection of Eikenella corrodens and Streptococcus constellatus].
AB  - Eikenella corrodens is a gram-negative, facultative anaerobic rod that frequently exists as part of normal human flora in the upper respiratory tract and gastrointestinal tract. Recently, E. corrodens is reported as a rare causative agent of empyematic lesion. We report a case of 10-year-old girl with acute subdural abscess. She developed a high grade fever, swelling of the left periorbital area, right sided partial seizure and hemiplegia. Brain CT and MRI showed left parietal subdural abscess. Because intravenous antibiotic therapy was not effective enough and her neurological symptoms progressed, surgical drainage was performed in order to decompress the brain and to determine the causative agents. Through careful bacterial cultures, E. corrodens and Streptococcus constellatus were detected from the subdural abscess. After the drainage operation and a three week course of appropriate chemotherapy, the abscess completely disappeared and no sequela remained.
TI  - [Clinical significance of the Streptococcus milleri group in peritonsillar abscesses].
AB  - Few researchers have microbiologically studied peritonsillar abscesses in detail, and their results have been conflicting. Although Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A beta-streptococcus) is commonly considered an important pathogen in this infection, recent studies have demonstrated the recovery of many other streptococci mainly consisting of alpha-streptococci. Few studies have identified these streptococci at the species level, however. We studied details of bacteriology in 31 cases of peritonsillar abscess treated between 1991 and 2000. The Streptococcus milleri group was most frequently isolated (25.8%), followed by Eikenella corrodens (9.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (6.5%), and S. pyogenes (3.2%). The S. milleri group, consisting of 3 species of Streptococcus constellatus, S. intermedius, and S. anginosus, forms part of the normal flora most commonly found in the mouth, throat, gastrointestinal tract, and genital tract. These species have become known as an important pathogen in abscess disease but little attention has been paid to their role in peritonsillar abscesses. To adequately culture the S. milleri group, incubation in air containing carbon dioxide or in an anaerobic condition is required, and then the differentiation of the 3 species requires the biochemical reactivity tests. Since hemolytic patterns of the S. milleri group vary, we studied the population of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-hemolytic strains among 36 strains of this group. We found 32 (88.8%) to be alpha-hemolytic. Although not all alpha-hemolytic strains belong to the S. milleri group, a considerable number of this group could be missed among alpha-streptococci isolated from the peritonsillar abscess. As antibiotics began being used widely, normal flora such as the S. milleri group may have become an important pathogen in peritonsillar abscesses due to an imbalance between organisms and host defense.
TI  - Microbiological evaluation of acute periradicular abscesses by DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present investigation was to examine the microbiota of acute periradicular abscesses of endodontic origin by using a molecular genetic method. STUDY DESIGN: Pus was collected by aspiration from 27 cases diagnosed as acute abscesses of endodontic origin, and DNA was extracted to evaluate the occurrence of 49 bacterial species by using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. The presence of bacterial DNA in clinical samples was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction with ubiquitous bacterial 16S rRNA gene primers. RESULTS: The results of the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization analysis revealed that 37 of the 49 DNA probes tested were reactive with one or more samples. The number of bacterial species in the pus samples ranged from 1 to 33 (mean, 5.9). Eighteen of the 27 pus samples were positive for at least one DNA probe. The most prevalent species found were: Bacteroides forsythus (29.6% of the cases); Porphyromonas gingivalis (29.6%); Streptococcus constellatus (25.9%), Prevotella intermedia (22.2%), Prevotella nigrescens (22.2%), Fusobacterium periodonticum (18.5%), Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies nucleatum (18.5%), and Eikenella corrodens (18.5%). CONCLUSIONS: The microbiologic data of the present investigation indicated that molecular genetic methods could provide additional knowledge regarding the microbiota of acute periradicular abscesses by detecting bacterial species that are difficult--or even impossible--to grow.
TI  - Profile of subgingival microbiota in children with mixed dentition.
AB  - A diversity of microbial species has been detected in children's oral flora at an early age. To investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of different groups of teeth in children with mixed dentition, 40 systemically healthy children, aged 7-8 years, randomly chosen, were examined. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of 21, 41, 16 and 36 permanent teeth and 53, 73, 64 and 84 deciduous teeth. The samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% CO2 plus air using selective and nonselective media. Forty-five different microbial species were isolated from both permanent and deciduous teeth. Streptococcus sanguis (79-70%), Streptococcus mitis (66-65%), Prevotella melaninogenica (51-57%), Eikenella corrodens (51-52%), Capnocytophaga gingivalis (46-34%), Capnocytophaga ochracea (45-45%), Actinomyces naeslundii (39-60%) and Prevotella intermedia (42-35%) were among the most frequently detected species in permanent and deciduous teeth respectively. Several suspected periodontal pathogens, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella loescheii, Campylobacter gracilis, Bacteroides forsythus, Campylobacter concisus, Peptostreptococcus micros and Selenomonas sputigena, albeit less frequently detected, were present in the microbiota of these children. The bacterial species Streptococcus constellatus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, E. corrodens and Fusobacterium nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding permanent and deciduous teeth whereas Streptococcus intermedius, C. concisus, P. intermedia and P. loescheii were associated with bleeding.
TI  - Isolation of Eikenella corrodens from polymicrobial hepatic abscess: report of one case.
AB  - Eikenella corrodens is a rare cause of hepatic abscess. We report a case of a hepatic abscess caused by (1) Bacteroides fragilis, (2) Streptococcus constellatus and (3) E. corrodens, which illustrates potential problems of antibiotic coverage due to the presence of Eikenella species. The infection followed an episode of acute gastroenteritis and the clinical course appeared indolent evolving over one week. Besides empirical antibiotics, initial percutaneous aspiration was performed and yielded pus which grew E. corrodens concomitantly with Streptococcus species. E. corrodens was sensitive to penicillin but resistant to clindamycin and metronidazole. But B. fragilis was resistant to penicillin. So the antibiotics were switched to amoxicillin/clavulanate. Unfortunately fever persisted and the abscess increased in size. Therefore echo-guided percutaneous drainage with pigtail catheter was installed. Fever subsided 5 days later. After 21 days treatment of antibiotics, the patient was discharged in good condition despite having some sterile fluid in the residual abscess cavity. Two months after discharge the follow-up echogram confirmed complete resolution of the residual abscess. This patient shows us the existence of E. corrodens in pediatric patients, especially when the hepatic abscess is very likely from the spread of an oral or abdominal infection.
TI  - Profile of subgingival microbiota in children with primary dentition.
AB  - Eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. The aim of the study was to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of primary incisors, canines and molars in 40 systemically healthy children aged 4-5 yr, chosen randomly. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of primary incisors (61, 81), canines (53, 73) and molars (64, 84). The samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% CO2 plus air using selective and non-selective media. Forty-one different microbial species were isolated. Gemella morbillorum and Peptostreptococcus magnus were statistically significantly more frequently detected in incisors while P. micros, Streptococcus intermedius, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella loeschei, P. melaninogenica and Selenomonas sputigena were more frequently detected in molars. The bacterial species S. constellatus, G. morbillorum and P. magnus were isolated in greater numbers in incisors and P. micros, S. intermedius, Campylobacter concisus, Bacteroides egertheii, B. forsythus, P. oralis and S. sputigena were isolated in greater numbers in molars, respectively. Cluster analysis revealed 4 clusters in which 6-7 bacterial species were elevated above mean levels. Cluster I was predominated by S. constellatus, S. mitis, S. sanguis, G. morbillorum, P. melaninogenica and P. oralis; cluster II was predominated by S. sanguis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, C. ochracea and P. intermedia; cluster III was predominated by S. mitis, C. ochracea, F. nucleatum, P. loeschei, P. melaninogenica and P. oralis; and finally cluster IV was predominated by S. sanguis, C. gingivalis, Veillonella parvula, Campylobacter gracilis, F. nucleatum and P. intermedia. The bacterial species S. constellatus, P. micros, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Eikenella corrodens and F. nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding sites while S. intermedius, C. concisus, P. intermedia and P. loescheii were found more frequently in bleeding sites.
TI  - Systemic doxycycline administration in the treatment of periodontal infections (II). Effect on antibiotic resistance of subgingival species.
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to determine the proportion and prevalence  of doxycycline resistant species in subgingival plaque samples taken during and after doxycycline administration. 20 subjects with adult periodontitis were randomly assigned to test (n = 10) or control groups (n = 10). Saliva samples as well as subgingival plaque samples taken from the distal surface of 6 posterior teeth were collected at baseline. All subjects received full mouth SRP and the test group systemic doxycycline at the dosage of 100 mg/day for 14 days. Saliva samples and plaque samples from the distal surface of 2 randomly selected teeth were taken at 3, 7 and 14 days during and after antibiotic administration. Control subjects were sampled at the same time points. Samples were anaerobically dispersed and serially diluted in PRAS Ringer's solution and plated on enriched Trypticase soy blood agar plates with or without 4 microg/ml doxycycline. After 7 days of anaerobic incubation, colonies were counted on both sets of plates. Microbial growth was washed from the doxycycline-containing media and the species identified using 40 DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Differences in proportions of resistant species between test and control groups were tested for significance at each time point using the Mann Whitney test and over time within each group using the Quade test. The mean % (+/-SEM) of isolates resistant to 4 microg/ml doxycycline in the plaque samples of the test subjects increased from 6+/-2 to 48+/-9% during doxycycline administration, decreasing to 25+/-6% 2 weeks later and 9+/-2% at 90 days. In saliva, the % of resistant isolates rose from 13+/-1% to 81+/-10% during doxycycline administration falling to 46+/-8% 2 weeks later and 22+/-5% at 90 days. The % of resistant isolates did not change significantly in plaque or saliva samples of the control subjects at the same time points. For all subject visits combined, the most prevalent resistant species were: Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Veillonella parvula, Actinomyces gerencseriae, Streptococcus constellatus, Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, Streptococcus gordonii, Eikenella corrodens and Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1. Doxycycline resistant strains of these species were detected in both plaque and saliva samples prior to therapy and in the control group. Despite the finding of increased resistance, approximately 50% of the organisms present at periodontal sites at the end of 14 days of doxycycline administration tested sensitive to the agent.
TI  - Microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  - It has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. The purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. The presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. Similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. Community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. One complex consisted of the tightly related group: Bacteroides forsythus, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola. The 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the Fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens and Peptostreptococcus micros. Species associated with this group included: Eubacterium nodatum, Campylobacter rectus, Campylobacter showae, Streptococcus constellatus and Campylobacter gracilis. The 3rd complex consisted of Streptococcus sanguis, S. oralis, S. mitis, S. gordonii and S. intermedius. The 4th complex was comprised of 3 Capnocytophaga species, Campylobacter concisus, Eikenella corrodens and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. The 5th complex consisted of Veillonella parvula and Actinomyces odontolyticus. A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, Selenomonas noxia and Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (A. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. The 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.
TI  - Interactions between Eikenella corrodens and 'Streptococcus milleri-group' organisms: possible mechanisms of pathogenicity in mixed infections.
AB  - Interactions between the 'Streptococcus milleri-group' organisms (SMG; S. intermedius, S. constellatus and S. anginosus) and Eikenella corrodens were investigated. Coaggregation reactions occurred frequently between S. anginosus (83% of strain combinations) or S. constellatus (87%) and E. corrodens isolates, but were infrequent between S. intermedius and E. corrodens (28%). No enhancement of enzyme activities against lipid, phosphate, peptide and saccharide substrates tested were detected with combinations of species in comparison to the species alone. Exponential growth of S. constellatus and S. intermedius, in mixed culture with E. corrodens, occurred within 6h post inoculation, in comparison to 25h without E. corrodens. No growth stimulation of S. anginosus was observed. It is concluded that both coaggregation and growth stimulation occur between E. corrodens and SMG isolates, and may be important mechanisms in the establishment of mixed infections involving these bacteria.
TI  - Cross-reactivity between human sialyl Lewis(x) oligosaccharide and common causative oral bacteria of infective endocarditis.
AB  - The expression of sialy-Lewis(x) (sLe(x); Neu5Ac alpha 2-3 Gal beta 1-4) (Fuc alpha 1-3) GlcNAc-R) on oral bacteria producing infective endocarditis was determined by a whole-cell enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and an immunoelectron microscopy using the well-characterized anti-sLe(x) monoclonal antibody SNH-3 (mAb SNH-3; IgM class). mAb SNH-3 reacted strongly with whole cells of oral bacteria: Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Eikenella corrodens and Porphyromonas gingivalis. The negatively stained immuno-electron micrograph of Streptococcus pyogenes showed many reactive gold particles on the cell surface. Our findings demonstrated the existence of immunologic mimicry between the sLe(x) oligosaccharide and cell surface antigens of many species associated with infective endocarditis. We propose the hypothesis that if these bacteria escape their normal habitats, the surface components that mimic the sLe(x) oligosaccharide might bind to host antigens of the selectin family which could promote binding to endothelial cells and, consequently, initiation of the events leading to infective endocarditis.
