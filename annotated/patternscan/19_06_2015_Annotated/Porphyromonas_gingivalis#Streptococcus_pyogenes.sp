TI  == antibacterial activity and cytotoxic effect of siab-gv3.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial activity and cytotoxic effect of the compound siab-gv3, a new formulation presenting as an aqueous suspension of silicon dioxide (sio2) functionalized with silver (ag+) nanoparticles and benzalkonium. the product is formulated as an adjuvant for the  treatment of inflammatory diseases of the oral cavity. this study demonstrates that siab-gv3 possesses strong antimicrobial activity against most of the common  oral pathogens, in particular against streptococcus pyogenes, porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinimycetemcomitans. the cytotoxic effect against human embryo lung fibroblasts (helf cells) was evaluated at different times, from 1 h to 168 h, using concentrations of siab-gv3 ranging from 50 mg/ml  to 0.0008 mg/ml. at the concentration of 10 mg/ml, commonly used in clinical practice, the compound results cyto- toxic after about 2 hours, this time being much longer than the typical time of local application, which is no more than 10  minutes. in conclusion, our findings suggest that siab-gv3 has a good antibacterial activity against the most common oral pathogens even at very low concentrations and a low cytotoxic activity, thanks to the synergistic effects of ag nanoparticles, silicon dioxide and benzalkonium.

TI  == inhibitory activity of myrtus communis oil on some clinically isolated oral pathogens.
AB  == objectives: to determine the antimicrobial activities of myrtus communis oil (mco) on some oral pathogens. material and methods: thirty strains of streptococcus mutans, aggregatibacteractinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and 20 strains of streptococcus pyogenes and candida albicans isolated from patients with dental caries, periodontal diseases, pharyngitis and oral lesions associated with artificial dentures were used for the antimicrobial activity of mco. the oil was prepared by hydrodistillation procedures using a clevenger apparatus. agar disk diffusion and broth microdilution methods were performed on various concentrations of mco (3.9-1,000 microg/ml) using all the pathogens isolated. results: all isolates were sensitive to mco at 125-1,000 microg/ml by agar disk diffusion producing inhibition zones of 8.1-41.25 mm in diameter. all of the s. pyogenes, s. mutans and c. albicans strains were sensitive to 62.5 microg/ml while 70% (21/30) of a. actinomycetemcomitans and 66.6% (20/30) of p. gingivalis were resistant to these concentrations. all s. pyogenes and s. mutans strains were sensitive to 31.25 microg/ml. all s. pyogenes strains were sensitive to 15.6 and 7.8 microg/ml of mco. none of the clinical isolates in this study were sensitive to 3.9 microg/ml or to a lower concentration of oil. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of mco for s. pyogenes, s. mutans, c. albicans, a.actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were  29.68 +/- 4.8, 31.25 +/- 0, 46.9 +/- 16, 62.5 +/- 0 and 62.5 +/- 0 microg/ml, respectively. conclusions: data obtained in this study revealed a strong antimicrobial activity of mco on the tested oral pathogens, and mco could therefore be useful in the prevention of the related oral infections.

TI  == oxygen deprivation affects the antimicrobial action of ll-37 as determined by microplate real-time kinetic measurements under anaerobic conditions.
AB  == some agents, including escherichia coli and group a streptococcus pyogenes cause  infections in oxygen depleted sites. ll-37 is a human host defence peptide shown  previously to play an important role in controlling infections caused by these bacteria. however, the effect of oxygen levels on the antimicrobial activity of ll-37 remains obscure. in order to test the effect of oxygen (or lack thereof) on ll-37's activity against e. coli and s. pyogenes, a method for adapting commonly  used microtiter plates for real-time growth-kinetic (and growth-inhibition) measurements under anaerobic conditions was developed. using the proposed method, anaerobic conditions were attained in the microplate within 30 min and were maintained for at least five days. anaerobiosis was further confirmed by comparing the growth of two anaerobic oral species (porphyromonas gingivalis and  fusobacterium nucleatum) in anaerobic compartments of microtiter plates versus aerobic ones. both species grew only in the anaerobic compartments of the plates  as indicated by the growth curves generated. the sensitivities of e. coli and s.  pyogenes to ll-37 were tested under anaerobic conditions and compared to those in aerobic ones. the oxygen facultative e. coli grew to a higher density under aerobic conditions and its sensitivity to ll-37 was increased under anaerobiosis. the microaerophilic pathogen s. pyogenes grew faster and to a higher density under anaerobic conditions and was much more resistant to ll-37 under oxygen deprivation. our results suggest that resistance to antimicrobial agents of microbes infecting anaerobic-microaerophilic sites should be tested under oxygen-restricted conditions.

TI  == antimicrobial sesquiterpenoids from laurus nobilis l.
AB  == activity-guided fractionations of leaf extracts from laurus nobilis l. led to the isolation of a known sesquiterpene lactone, deacetyl laurenobiolide (1). compound 1 showed antimicrobial activity against periopathic pathogens (actinomyces viscosus, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), opportunistic gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes) and fungi (candida albicans, cryptococcus neoformans and aspergillus fumigatus). furthermore, acetylation and cyclisation of deacetyl laurenobiolide (1) yielded laurenobiolide (2) and a new compound, (5s,6r,7s,8s,10r)-6,8-dihydroxyeudesma-4(15),11(13)-dien-12-oic acid 12,8-lactone (3), respectively. compounds 2 and 3 also showed antimicrobial activities. all compounds 1-3 demonstrated growth inhibitory effects with minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 31 to 1000 microg ml(-1). this is the first report of compounds 1-3 showing antimicrobial activities.

TI  == mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  == the oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. when this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. the mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the streptococcus (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis) and staphylococcus (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis. in addition, some members of both the streptococcus and the staphylococcus genera, as well as porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. the current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. the pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.

TI  == the changing faces of streptococcus antigen i/ii polypeptide family adhesins.
AB  == streptococcus mutans antigen i/ii (agi/ii) protein was one of the first cell wall-anchored adhesins identified in gram-positive bacteria. it mediates attachment of s. mutans to tooth surfaces and has been a focus for immunization studies against dental caries. the agi/ii family polypeptides recognize salivary  glycoproteins, and are also involved in biofilm formation, platelet aggregation,  tissue invasion and immune modulation. the genes encoding agi/ii family polypeptides are found among streptococcus species indigenous to the human mouth, as well as in streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae and s. suis. evidence of functionalities for different regions of the agi/ii proteins has emerged. a sequence motif within the c-terminal portion of streptococcus gordonii sspb (agi/ii) is bound by porphyromonas gingivalis, thus promoting oral colonization by this anaerobic pathogen. the significance of other epitopes is now clearer following resolution of regional crystal structures. a new picture emerges of the central v (variable) region, predicted to contain a carbohydrate-binding trench,  being projected from the cell surface by a stalk formed by an unusual association between an n-terminal alpha-helix and a c-terminal polyproline helix. this presentation mode might be important in determining functional conformations of other gram-positive surface proteins that have adhesin domains flanked by alpha-helical and proline-rich regions.

TI  == how microorganisms avoid phagocyte attraction.
AB  == microorganisms have developed several mechanisms to modulate the host immune system to increase their survival and propagation in the host. their presence in  the host is not only revealed by self-produced peptides but also through host-derived chemokines and active complement fragments. these so-called chemoattractants are recognized by g protein-coupled receptors (gpcrs) expressed  on leukocyte cell membranes. activation of gpcrs triggers leukocyte activation and guides their recruitment to the site of infection. therefore, gpcrs play a central role in leukocyte trafficking leading to microbial clearance. it is therefore not surprising that microorganisms are able to sabotage this arm of the immune response. different microorganisms have evolved a variety of tactics to modulate gpcr activation. here, we review the mechanisms and proteins used by major human pathogens and less virulent microorganisms that affect gpcr signaling. while viruses generally produce receptor and chemoattractant mimics, parasites and bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, porphyromonas gingivalis, and bordetella pertussis secrete proteins that affect receptor signaling, directly antagonize receptors, cleave stimuli, and even prevent stimulus generation. as the large arsenal of gpcr modulators aids prolonged microbial persistence in the host, their study provides us a better understanding of microbial pathogenesis.

TI  == bacteriological and clinical evaluation of twelve cases of post-surgical sepsis of odontogenic tumours at a referral centre.
AB  == objective: to determine the bacterial aetiology of sepsis occurring following surgery of odontogenic tumours and assess the effect of prompt and proper antibiotic usage. design: a prospective study. setting: a tertiary referral centre in lagos, nigeria. subjects: twelve patients with odontogenic tumours that developed sepsis postoperatively. eight of the patients were referred from private hospitals, the remaining were in-patients who sought for alternative medical attention following interruption of health care services at the referral  centre. intervention: adequate review of patient's medical history, bacteriological investigations and antibiotic therapy. main outcome measures: bacteriological and clinical cure following antibiotic therapy based on susceptibility test results. results: two categories of patients were identified; those who completed the course of antibiotics prescribed post-surgery and patients who failed to conform to antibiotic prescription. sepsis developed in the non-compliance group much earlier than in the group that complied (p<0.001).  infections were polybacterial with aerobes accounting for 77.4% (alpha-haemolytic streptococci 29.0%, streptococcus pyogenes 16.1%, staphylococcus aureus 16.1%, diphtheroids 9.7%, klebsiella pneumoniae 6.5%) and anaerobes 22.6% (porphyromonas gingivalis 9.7%, peptostreptococcus spp. 6.5%, prevotella melaninogenica 3.2%, clostridium perfringens 3.2%). mixed aerobic and anaerobic aetiology occurred more in osteosarcoma and fibrosarcoma. clostridium perfringens was isolated from  a case of osteosarcoma with necrotic tissues. the anaerobic bacteria were 100% sensitive to metronidazole, ciprofloxacin and augmentin, 65-85% sensitivity to ampicloxacillin, amoxicillin and erythromycin. over 92% of the streptococci were  sensitive to the beta-lactams contrast low susceptibility with s. aureus and k. pneumoniae. conclusion: interruption of healthcare service was the sole factor identified in the development of sepsis as the patients could not be monitored to ensure compliance to prescription.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial and resistance-modifying activities of aqueous crude khat  extracts against oral microorganisms.
AB  == objectives: to assess antimicrobial activities of aqueous crude khat (catha edulis) extracts against a panel of oral microorganisms and to test their ability to modify bacterial resistance to tetracycline and penicillin in vitro. design: lyophilized aqueous extracts were prepared from three khat cultivars. the agar dilution method of the nccls was used to test the extracts, at concentrations of  20-1.25 mg/ml, against 33 oral strains. mic was defined as the lowest concentration at which there was no visible growth. slight growth was defined as  marked growth reduction (mgr). the e-test was used to determine the mics of tetracycline and penicillin-g for three resistant strains in absence and presence of a sub-mic of the khat extracts (5mg/ml). results: eighteen strains (55%) were  sensitive to the extracts (mics 5-20 mg/ml). most of these were periodontal pathogens with porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythensis being the most susceptible (mic 5-10mg/ml). veillonella parvula, actinomyces israelii and some streptococci were not sensitive. except for lactobacillus acidophilus that showed mgr at 1mg/ml, cariogenic species were neither sensitive. the extracts were active against streptococcus pyogenes (mic 10-20 mg/ml) but not against candida albicans and staphylococcus aureus. the presence of the khat extracts at  a sub-mic resulted in a 2-4-fold potentiation of the tested antibiotics against the resistant strains. conclusions: khat has water-soluble constituents possessing selective antibacterial activity against oral bacteria. there is preliminary evidence for presence of an antibiotic resistance-modifying component. further investigation is needed to identify the active components and  assess their clinical relevance.

TI  == single species biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates on gutta-percha points.
AB  == the participation of bacterial biofilms in the over-filled gutta-percha points associated with refractory periapical periodontitis has recently been reported. this study investigated the initial biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates (enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, fusobacterium nucleatum, propionibacterium acnes, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia) on gutta-percha points in vitro. each bacterial strain was suspended in 100% cell culture medium or in culture medium containing 4.5, 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. the bacterial suspensions were then co-incubated anaerobically with gutta-percha  points for 7 d. the gutta-percha points were processed for scanning electron microscopic observation and examined for biofilm presence and thickness. e. faecalis, strep. sanguis, strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes and staph. aureus biofilms were generated on the surfaces of the specimens incubated in culture medium supplemented with 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. the e. faecalis and strep. sanguis biofilms were significantly thicker than those of strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes and staph. aureus. no biofilms were detected on the specimens incubated with f. nucleatum, prop. acnes, porph. gingivalis and prev. intermedia. these findings suggest that gram-positive facultative anaerobes have the ability  to colonize and form extracellular matrices on gutta-percha points, while serum plays a crucial role in biofilm formation.

TI  == innate immune response of oral and foreskin keratinocytes: utilization of different signaling pathways by various bacterial species.
AB  == the innate immune response is critical for the epithelial antimicrobial barrier.  the human beta-defensins are small, cationic antimicrobial peptides that are made by epithelial cells and that play a role in mucosal and skin defenses. human beta-defensin 1 (hbd-1) is expressed constitutively in epithelial tissues, whereas hbd-2 and hbd-3 are expressed in response to bacterial stimuli or inflammation. previous studies showed that hbd-2 was induced by fusobacterium nucleatum cell wall extract without the involvement of the nf-kappab transcription factors, which typically are associated with innate immunity and inflammation. the goal of this study was to characterize signaling pathways involved in hbd-2 induction in response to commensal and pathogenic bacteria. cultured human oral and foreskin keratinocytes were treated separately with inhibitors of nf-kappab, c-jun n-terminal kinase (jnk), and p38 and then stimulated with oral commensal streptococcus gordonii, oral pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, skin commensal staphylococcus epidermidis, or skin pathogen streptococcus pyogenes. different bacteria induced different levels of hbd-2 and in response to the various inhibitors tested, although certain common patterns were observed for commensal-  and pathogen-stimulated cells. hbd-2 induction by all bacteria tested was partially or completely blocked by inhibitors of the jnk and p38 pathways. however, in addition, hbd-2 induction by pathogenic bacteria in both oral and foreskin keratinocytes was blocked by inhibitors of nf-kappab. the results indicate that commensal and pathogenic bacteria utilize different pathways in hbd-2 induction and suggest that epithelial cells from different body sites have  common signaling mechanisms to distinguish between commensal and pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == purification and characterization of a novel cysteine proteinase (periodontain) from porphyromonas gingivalis. evidence for a role in the inactivation of human alpha1-proteinase inhibitor.
AB  == periodontal disease is characterized by inflammation of the periodontium manifested by recruitment of neutrophils, which can degranulate, releasing powerful proteinases responsible for destruction of connective tissues, and eventual loss of tooth attachment. although the presence of host proteinase inhibitors (serpins) should minimize tissue damage by endogenous proteinases, this is not seen clinically, and it has been speculated that proteolytic inactivation of serpins may contribute to progression of the disease. a major pathogen associated with periodontal disease is the gram-negative anaerobe porphyromonas gingivalis, and in this report, we describe a novel proteinase that has been isolated from culture supernatants of this organism that is capable of inactivating the human serpin, alpha1-proteinase inhibitor, the primary endogenous regulator of human neutrophil elastase. this new enzyme, referred to as periodontain, belongs to the cysteine proteinase family based on inhibition studies and exists as a 75-kda heterodimer. furthermore, periodontain shares significant homology to streptopain, a proteinase from streptococcus pyogenes, and prtt, a putative proteinase from p. gingivalis. clearly, the presence of this enzyme, which rapidly inactivates alpha1-proteinase inhibitor, could result in elevated levels of human neutrophil elastase clinically detected in periodontal disease and should be considered as a potential virulence factor for p. gingivalis.

TI  == the efficacy of antimicrobial mouth rinses in oral health care.
AB  == there is growing public recognition of the importance of oral health, as symbolized by the theme. "oral health for a healthy life" proposed for the 1994 world health day. in this report, the efficacy of antimicrobial mouth rinses, mainly listerine, was reviewed by three investigators who are working as a microbiologist, a microbiologist, a dentist, and a dental hygienist participating in oral health care. listerine, an antimicrobial mouth rinse, completely killed microorganisms in 10 to 30 seconds; the microbes includes methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, helicobacter pylori, candida albicans, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. listerine was also weakly effective in inactivating human immunodeficiency viruses. bacteria in samples collected from human dental plaque and saliva were completely killed within 30 seconds when exposed to listerine. when saliva samples were collected from subjects who had rinsed their mouths with 20 ml of listerine or 1:50 diluted povidone-iodine, levels of viable anaerobic bacteria in the samples were reduced  to 1%. when listerine was used for oral surgery such as tooth extraction and periodontal surgery, the agent was effective in relieving toothache. this was probably due to a decrease in oral bacteria by the antimicrobial action of listerine, leading to lowering the inflammatory response of the host. the use of  antimicrobial mouth rinse during dental treatments such as endodontic treatment proved effective for more reliable infection control. in japan, there are an increasing number of elderly and medically compromised hosts who are potentially  at risk for developing pneumonia due to silent aspiration of microbes in the oral cavity and throat. for the aged with such potential risk, using of antimicrobial  mouth rinse may be effective in preventing dental plaque accumulation when used in addition to the mechanical control of plaque, since they tend to have difficulty in brushing teeth by themselves. indeed, the use of antimicrobial mouth rinse in these elderly people proved useful not only in preventing bacterial pneumonia, but also in improving their quality of life by preserving their oral health.

TI  == cross-reactivity between human sialyl lewis(x) oligosaccharide and common causative oral bacteria of infective endocarditis.
AB  == the expression of sialy-lewis(x) (sle(x); neu5ac alpha 2-3 gal beta 1-4) (fuc alpha 1-3) glcnac-r) on oral bacteria producing infective endocarditis was determined by a whole-cell enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and an immunoelectron microscopy using the well-characterized anti-sle(x) monoclonal antibody snh-3 (mab snh-3; igm class). mab snh-3 reacted strongly with whole cells of oral bacteria: streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus pyogenes, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens and porphyromonas gingivalis. the negatively stained immuno-electron micrograph of streptococcus pyogenes showed many reactive gold particles on the cell surface. our findings demonstrated the existence of immunologic mimicry between the sle(x) oligosaccharide and cell surface antigens of many species associated with infective endocarditis. we propose the hypothesis that if these bacteria escape their normal habitats, the surface components that mimic the sle(x) oligosaccharide might bind to host antigens of the selectin family which could promote binding to endothelial cells and, consequently, initiation of the events  leading to infective endocarditis.

TI  == revised sequence of the porphyromonas gingivalis prtt cysteine protease/hemagglutinin gene: homology with streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin b/streptococcal proteinase.
AB  == the prtt gene from porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 53977 was previously isolated from an escherichia coli clone possessing trypsinlike protease activity upstream  of a region encoding hemagglutinin activity (j. otogoto and h. kuramitsu, infect. immun. 61;117-123, 1993). subsequent molecular analysis of this gene has revealed that the prtt protein is larger than originally reported, encompassing the hemagglutination region. results of primer extension experiments indicate that the translation start site was originally misidentified. an alternate open reading frame of nearly 2.7 kb, which encodes a protein in the size range of 96 to 99 kda, was identified. in vitro transcription-translation experiments confirm this size, and northern (rna) blot experiments indicate that the protease is translated from a 3.3-kb mrna. searching the embl protein database revealed that  the amino acid sequence of the revised prtt is similar to sequences of two related proteins from streptococcus pyogenes. prtt is 31% identical and 73% similar over 401 amino acids to streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin b. in addition,  it is 36% identical and 74% similar over 244 amino acids with streptococcal proteinase, which is closely related to streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin b. the similarity is particularly high at the putative active site of streptococcal proteinase, which is similar to the active sites of the family of cysteine proteases. thus, we conclude that prtt is a 96- to 99-kda cysteine protease and hemagglutinin with significant similarity to streptococcal enzymes.

TI  == bacterial interference in vitro. comparison between a quantitative kinetic and a  cocultivation blood agar test method.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to compare two methods for estimation of bacterial growth interference between various bacteria using a bioscreen robot analyzer, allowing kinetic documentation, and a cocultivation test on blood agar  plates. six laboratory strains with different virulence and growth requirements were used: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus mitis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. the interference activity was correlated with a reference system of streptococcus sanguis (strain alpha 89) and streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococci, gas serotypes t 9 and t 22). the methods used and results obtained were as follows: 1. estimation of synergistic and antagonistic bacterial interferences using a bioscreen robot analyzer. suspensions of viable bacteria were added to microtiter plates with different concentrations of uv light-killed bacteria in liquid media. the bioscreen analyzer monitored bacterial growth every 10 min for 24 h giving kinetic data during the growth period. synergisms as well as antagonisms were demonstrated between the tested bacterial  strains which have not earlier been reported in the literature. however, the antagonistic effect observed between the six strains was less than that induced by the s. sanguis strain on the two strains of s. pyogenes. 2. cocultivation of bacterial strains on blood agar surface with precultivated or simultaneously stamped interfering bacteria indicated no detectable interference between the six tested bacterial strains, while the s. sanguis strain inhibited the growth of s.  pyogenes strains as well as the hemolysis around the colonies. the bioscreen method was found more sensitive for testing bacterial interference compared to the commonly used blood agar test.
