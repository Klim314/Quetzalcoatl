TI  == [probiotic properties of industrial strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria].
AB  == lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria were isolated from the samples of dry microbial substance "vivolac" and identified. the lactic acid bacteria were identified as lactobacillus acidophilus. l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. paracasei. bifidobacteria belonged to the species bifidobacterium animalis. manifestation of biological activity of all studied strains was investigated. it  was shown, that adhesive activity of the studied strains depended on the genus of the strain: lactobacilli manifested medium adhesiveness to buccal epithelium (medium adhesive index 2.07-2.26), bifidobacteria manifested high adhesiveness (medium adhesive index 4.11-4.76). antagonism against pathogenic and opportunistic reference strains was manifested to a greater extent to pseudomonas aeruginosa. lactobacilli and bifidobacteria were resistant to aminoglycosides. sensitivity of the studied strains to antibiotics did not depend on the genus and species of microorganism. lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains were capable  to survive in gastric juice and at different concentration of bile, which is promising for development of probiotic preparations on the basis of these strains.

TI  == screening of lactic-acid bacteria from south african barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  == strains of lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain st11br), l. pentosus  (strain st151br), l. plantarum (strain st13br), and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain st34br) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the western, northern and eastern provinces of south africa. the peptides (bacst11br, bacst151br, bacst13br and bacst34br) lost their  activity after treatment with proteinase k, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. the peptides inhibited the growth of lactobacillus casei, l. sakei, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis, but not enterobacter cloacae, lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, l. plantarum, l. salivarius, listeria innocua, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus uberis, s. agalactiae, s. caprinus and s. pneumoniae. peptides bacst11br and bacst13br differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the e. coli strains. peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at ph 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees c. when autoclaved (121 degrees c, 20 min), only bacst13br lost its activity. the bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees c,  but not at 37 degrees c.
