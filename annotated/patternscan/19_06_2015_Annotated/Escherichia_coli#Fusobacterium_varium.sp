TI  == production of corticotropin-releasing factor and urocortin from human monocyte-derived dendritic cells is stimulated by commensal bacteria in intestine.
AB  == aim: to examine whether commensal bacteria are a contributing cause of stress-related mucosal inflammation. methods: human peripheral blood monocyte-derived dendritic cells (modcs) were stimulated by commensal bacterial strains, including escherichia coli, clostridium clostridioforme, bacteroides vulgatus (b. vulgatus), fusobacterium varium (f. varium), and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. after incubation, corticotropin-releasing factor (crf) and urocortin 1 (ucn1) mrna in the cells was examined by real-time reverse  transcription polymerase chain reaction. supernatants from the cells were tested  for crf and ucn1 using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: both crf and ucn1 were significantly augmented by b. vulgatus and f. varium at both the mrna and protein levels. in particular, b. vulgatus stimulated human modcs, resulting in extremely high levels of crf and ucn1. conclusion: stimulation of modcs by b. vulgatus and f. varium may be associated with crf/ucn1-related intestinal disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  == [role of infectious agents in the emergence of malignant tumors].
AB  == according to the data of the international agency for research on cancer (iarc),  at least 6 virus species (hpv, ebv, hhv-8/kshv, htlv-1, hbv, hcv), 4 helminthes species (schistosoma haematobium and japonicum, opisthorchis viverrini, clonorchis sinensis) and i bacterium species (helicobacter pylori) have been proved to be capable of causing the development of cancer. the analysis of the data available shows that merkel cell polyomavirus (mcv), herpes simplex virus (hsv), john cunningham polyomavirus (jcv), monkey virus 40 (sv40), cytomegalovirus (cmv), xenotropic murine leukemia virus (xmrv), helicobacter bilis and hepaticus, campylobacter jejuni, fusobacterium varium, enteropathogenic escherichia coli, enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides vulgatus, prevotella spp., streptococcus bovis and anginosus, treponema denticola, salmonella typhi, paratyphi and typhimurium, borrelia burgdorferi, bartonella spp., mycobacterium tuberculosis, chlamydia pneumoniae, trachomatis and psittaci, neisseria gonorrhoeae, propionibacterium acnes, tropheryma whippelii, schistosoma mansoni, opistorchis felineus, strongyloides stercoralis, taenia solium, candida  spp., paracoccidioides brasiliensis, histoplasma capsulatum and trichomonas vaginalis can also be potential etiological agents of cancer. apparently, detection of new associations between infectious agents and risk of the development of cancer will facilitate progress in elaboration of prophylaxis measures, early diagnostic methods and, probably, methods of treatment of malignant tumors.

TI  == corticotropin-releasing factor secretion from dendritic cells stimulated by commensal bacteria.
AB  == aim: to study the production and secretion of corticotropin-releasing factor (crf) by dendritic cells and the influence of commensal bacteria. methods: jawsii cells (atcc crl-11904), a mouse dendritic cell line, were seeded into 24-well culture plates and grown for 3 d. commensal bacterial strains of clostridium clostrodiiforme (jcm1291), bacteroides vulgatus (b. vulgatus) (jcm5856), escherichia coli (jcm1649), or fusobacterium varium (f. varium) (atcc8501) were added to the cells except for the control well, and incubated for 2 h. after incubation, we performed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the cultured medium and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for the dendritic cells, and compared these values with controls. results: the level of crf secretion by control dendritic cells was 40.4 +/- 6.2 pg/ml. the crf levels for cells incubated with f. varium and b. vulgatus were significantly higher than that of the control (p < 0.0001). crf mrna was present in the control sample without bacteria, and crf mrna levels in all samples treated with bacteria were above that of the control sample. f. varium caused the greatest increase in crf mrna expression. conclusion: our results suggest that dendritic cells produce crf, a process augmented by commensal bacteria.

TI  == commensal bacteria can enter colonic epithelial cells and induce proinflammatory  cytokine secretion: a possible pathogenic mechanism of ulcerative colitis.
AB  == interleukin 2 (il-2)- and il-10-knockout mice develop spontaneous colitis under conventional but not germ-free conditions, suggesting that commensal bacteria play an important role in the pathogenesis of colitis. however, interactions between commensal bacteria and colonic epithelial cells have not been fully investigated. we therefore assessed the ability of various commensal bacteria and probiotics to adhere to and invade colonic epithelial cells. effects of the bacteria on production of proinflammatory cytokines were also measured. commensal bacteria, including mucosal organisms isolated from ulcerative colitis (uc) patients, such as fusobacterium varium, reported as a possible pathogen in uc, bacteroides vulgatus, escherichia coli and clostridium clostridioforme, as well as their type strains and probiotics, were assessed for their ability to adhere to and invade colonic epithelial cells using two cell lines, sw-480 and ht-29. our experiments employed co-incubation, a combination of scanning and transmission electron microscopy and recovery of bacteria from infected-cell lysates. f. varium and several other commensal bacteria, but not probiotics, adhered to colonic epithelial cells and invaded their cytoplasm. elisa and real-time pcr revealed that the host cells, particularly those invaded by f. varium, showed significant increases in il-8 and tnf-alpha concentrations in supernatants, with elevation of il-8, tnf-alpha, mcp-1 and il-6 mrnas. furthermore, il-8 and tnf-alpha expression and nuclear phosphorylated nf-kappab p65 expression could be immunohistochemically confirmed in inflamed epithelium with cryptitis or crypt abscess in uc patients. certain commensal bacteria can invade colonic epithelial cells, activating early intracellular signalling systems to trigger host inflammatory reactions.

TI  == a simulation of microbial competition in the human colonic ecosystem.
AB  == many investigations of the interactions of microbial competitors in the gastrointestinal tract used continuous-flow anaerobic cultures. the simulation reported here was a deterministic 11-compartment model coded by using the c programming language and based on parameters from published in vitro studies and  assumptions were data were unavailable. the resource compartments were glucose, lactose and sucrose, starch, sorbose, and serine. six microbial competitors included indigenous nonpathogenic colonizers of the human gastrointestinal tract  (escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, bacteroids ovatus, fusobacterium varium, and enterococcus faecalis) and the potential human enteropathogen salmonella typhimurium. flows of carbon from the resources to the microbes were modified by resource and space controls. partitioning of resources to the competitors that could utilize them was calculated at each iteration on the basis of availability of all resources by feeding preference functions. resources did not accumulate during iterations of the model. the results of the computer simulation of microbial competition model and for various modifications of the model. the results were based on few measured parameters but may be useful in the design of user-friendly software to aid researchers in defining and manipulating  the microbial ecology of colonic ecosystems as relates to food-borne disease.

TI  == fusobacterial infections in children.
AB  == a total of 243 strains of fusobacteria species was recovered from 226 of 1399 (16%) specimens obtained from 213 children. the strains included 65 (27%) fusobacterium sp., 144 (59%) fusobacterium nucleatum, 25 (10%) fusobacterium necrophorum, five (2%) fusobacterium varium, three (1%) fusobacterium mortiferum, and one (0.4%) fusobacterium gonidiaformans. most fusobacteria species were recovered from patients with abscesses (100), aspiration pneumonia (24), paronychia (15), bites (14), chronic sinusitis (ten), chronic otitis media (nine), and osteomyelitis (eight). predisposing conditions were noted in 32 (15%) of the cases. these included immunodeficiency in nine (4%), steroid therapy in eight (4%), previous surgery in six (3%), diabetes in six (3%) and malignant neoplasms in five (2%). fusobacteria sp. was the only isolate in 16 (8%) instances while mixed infections were encountered in 197 (92%) patients. the organisms most commonly isolated with fusobacteria sp. were anaerobic cocci (155), pigmented prevotella sp. and porphyromonas sp. (95), bacteroides fragilis  group (80), escherichia coli (43) and bacteroides sp. (39). most strains of b. fragilis group and e. coli were recovered from intra-abdominal infections and skin and soft tissue infections proximal to the rectal area. most pigmented prevotella sp. and porphyromonas sp. were recovered from oropharyngeal and pulmonary sites and from sites around the head and neck. antimicrobial therapy was administered to all patients; surgical drainage was performed in 85 (40%). all patients, except two who died, recovered. these findings illustrate the prevalence of fusobacteria sp. associated with infections in children.

TI  == selected faecal bacteria and nutrients essential for antagonism of salmonella typhimurium in anaerobic continuous flow cultures.
AB  == as few as five of the species of bacteria commonly found in human faeces--escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides ovatus and fusobacterium varium--when grown together in anaerobic continuous flow cultures exerted antagonistic effects on salmonella typhimurium as great as those given by mixed bacteria from extracts of human faeces. in a single culture, the population of s. typhimurium was c. 10(8) cfu/ml but in mixed cultures with the five antagonistic bacteria or mixed faecal bacteria it was reduced to c. 10(3) cfu/ml. antagonism appeared to be the result of competition for the growth limiting amino acids, arginine, serine, threonine and aspartic acid. optimal manifestation of antagonism required the presence of carbon sources fermentable only by antagonistic bacteria, such as lactose 0.1%, w/v, sucrose 0.1% (w/v) and starch 0.2-0.3% w/v. these carbohydrates promoted the growth of the antagonistic bacteria, particularly e. coli and b. ovatus. however, an increase in concentration by several fold of any one of four growth-limiting amino acids in the medium diminished the antagonistic effects and the population  of s. typhimurium rose 10(2)-10(3)-fold.

TI  == the role of escherichia coli haemolysin in the pathogenic synergy of colonic bacteria in subcutaneous abscess formation in mice.
AB  == the growth of nine species of colonic bacteria--escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides ovatus, fusobacterium varium, clostridium perfringens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus and bifidobacterium adolescentis--was examined after concomitant injection to form experimental subcutaneous abscesses in mice. injection of a mixture of c. 10(5) cfu of each of the first five strains (e. coli, ent. faecalis, b. ovatis, f. varium and c. perfringens) resulted in abscess formation in all mice tested when  the e. coli strain was haemolytic. e. coli and b. ovatus multiplied and reached a maximum population of c. 10(8) cfu/abscess. when non-haemolytic e. coli was used, injection of greater than or equal to 10(7) cfu was required for abscess formation. the inclusion of partially purified e. coli haemolysin (125 hu50) with c. 10(5) cfu of bacteria including non-haemolytic e. coli resulted in abscess formation in most mice tested. these results indicate that e. coli haemolysin is  one factor that may potentiate pathogenic synergy among colonic bacteria especially between e. coli and b. ovatus, during abscess formation.

TI  == potent antagonism of escherichia coli, bacteroides ovatus, fusobacterium varium,  and enterococcus faecalis, alone or in combination, for enteropathogens in anaerobic continuous flow cultures.
AB  == interactions between representative strains of four predominant resident bacteria of the human colon, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides ovatus,  and fusobacterium varium, and strains of seven enteropathogens, yersinia enterocolitica, shigella flexneri, salmonella typhimurium, vibrio parahaemolyticus, v. cholerae serogroup non o1, staphylococcus aureus, and clostridium perfringens, were examined in studies with an anaerobic continuous flow culture system and medium resembling the content of the mouse caecum (mcm).  potent unilateral antagonism attributable to synergic activities of the resident  bacteria against the enteropathogens was evident. the four resident bacteria persisted at levels of c. 10(6) cfu/ml or more in single and in any mixed cultures of the resident species. the seven enteropathogens also persisted in single cultures. in contrast, y. enterocolitica was excluded in several days in mixed cultures with each of the four resident bacteria. sh. flexneri and staph. aureus were excluded in the presence of e. coli alone. c. perfringens, v. parahaemolyticus and v. cholerae serogroup non o1 were excluded in the presence of e. coli with b. ovatus and, in some cases, with additional species. s. typhimurium was the most resistant; only c. 10(2)-fold reduction of the population level was observed in mixed culture with all four of the resident species. when the amounts of some components in the medium, such as peptone and yeast extract, were increased, c. perfringens grew and persisted even in the presence of the four resident bacteria. sh. flexneri, in contrast decreased steadily, even in enriched media.

TI  == the relationship between fusobacterium species and other flora in mixed infection.
AB  == mixed infections with three fusobacterium species and seven other bacterial species were studied in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. fifteen fusobacterium isolates (eight f. nucleatum, four f. necrophorum, and three f. varium) and one isolate each of bacteroides fragilis, b. asaccharolyticus, staphylococcus aureus, group a beta-haemolytic streptococcus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied. electronmicrographs showed the presence of a thin mucopolysaccharide wall before  and after inoculation into mice in 12 isolates which included all of 11 fusobacterium isolates that induced subcutaneous abscesses. after co-inoculation  of fusobacterium isolates with other species and selective therapy with antimicrobial agents, s. aureus and k. pneumoniae were found to be of equal or greater importance in abscess induction than were fusobacterium isolates, while fusobacterium isolates were found to be more important than group a streptococci  and e. coli. mutual enhancement of the numbers of organisms in mixed infections was observed with fusobacterium spp. and k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa or bacteroides spp. suppression of fusobacterium spp. was noticed only when they were co-inoculated with group a streptococci. the additive or synergistic capabilities of fusobacterium species highlighted their potential pathogenicity in infection.

TI  == investigation of the immune response to aerobic and anaerobic intestinal bacteria in a patient with crohn's disease.
AB  == the immune response to aerobic and anaerobic intestinal bacteria in a patient with crohn's disease with an intestinal fistula was investigated with various serological techniques. two aerobic bacterial species, e. dispar and p. mirabilis, and four strict anaerobic bacterial species, b. fragilis ss. fragilis, f. varium and two different strains of c. perfringens, were isolated from fistula secretion of the patient. these strains were used as antigens for tube agglutination, passive hemagglutination, indirect immunofluorescence and immune hemolysis assays with serum specimens obtained before and after operation of the  patient. immune responses were demonstrated to the aerobic as well as to the anaerobic bacterial strains isolated from the patient's fistula. in connection with the operation an active immune response was demonstrated to the aerobic and  anaerobic bacterial isolates. antibodies belonging to igg and iga took part in the active immune response while igm was very little involved. antibodies responsible for passive hemagglutination reactions were resistant to treatment with beta-mercaptoethanol. antibodies to aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative rods were shown to have complement fixing activity. the importance of the demonstrated antibodies for the host's defence against normal intestinal microorganisms and the inflammatory reaction as a consequence of chronic antigenic stimulation in the diseased part of the intestine in patients with crohn's disease is discussed.

TI  == microbial synergy in experimental intra-abdominal abscess.
AB  == intra-abdominal sepsis was studied in wistar rats by using four microbial species: escherichia coli, enterococci, bacteroides fragilis, and fusobacterium varium. these organisms were implanted into the peritoneal cavity singly and in all possible dual combinations. results were evaluated by mortality rates and the incidence of intra-abdominal abscesses on autopsy following sacrifice after 7 days. mortality was restricted to recipients of e. coli, thus implicating coliforms in the acute lethality associated with this experimental model. intra-abdominal abscesses were produced in 61 of 95 (94%) animals that received the combination of an anaerobe and a facultative organism. abscesses failed to form with any single strain or with e. coli plus enterococci, and they were detected in one 1 of 19 animals receiving b. fragilis plus f. varium. these results suggest that intra-abdominal abscess formation is related to synergy between anaerobes and facultative bacteria.
