TI  == antimicrobial effect of chlorhexidine in a controlled release delivery system.
AB  == chlorhexidine is widely used as a mouth rinse in the prevention and treatment of  periodontal diseases and dental caries. the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial effect of chlorhexidine in a controlled release delivery system. the controlled release dispenser comprised a polymeric inner core matrix containing the medicament with an outer vinyl membrane controlling the drug release. the effect on the following bacteria was studied: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mutans, wolinella recta, bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, eikenella corrodens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae. chlorhexidine-containing vinyl patches with a diameter of 5.5 mm were placed on blood agar plates containing the various bacteria. the plates were incubated aerobically or anaerobically at 37 degrees c for 24 h or longer, when appropriate, and examined for inhibition of bacterial growth. distinct zones of inhibition were seen surrounding all vinyl patches on all plates with all bacteria. thus, the vinyl dispenser appeared to be an effective vehicle for releasing chlorhexidine to a localized area such as the surface of a tooth, a periodontal pocket, or a root canal.

TI  == efficacy of imipenem/cilastatin in endocarditis.
AB  == imipenem, a potent new beta-lactam antibiotic, which is bactericidal against most pathogenic bacteria, and cilastatin, a dehydropeptidase inhibitor combined with imipenem to prevent the metabolism of imipenem in the kidney, were evaluated in the treatment of bacterial endocarditis. seventeen patients, including 14 who used intravenous drugs, were treated with imipenem/cilastatin in a dose of 500 mg each infused over 30 minutes every six hours. the mean duration of treatment was  29 days with a range of 21 to 56 days. causative bacteria were staphylococcus aureus in 10 patients, s. aureus plus group b streptococcus in one, viridans group streptococcus in two, neisseria subflava, eikenella corrodens, and group g  streptococcus in one patient, and staphylococcus epidermidis, hemophilus aphrophilus, and enterobacter aerogenes in one patient each. the minimal bactericidal concentration of imipenem against 16 of 18 isolates tested was 0.04  micrograms/ml, 1 microgram/ml against h. aphrophilus, and 0.4 micrograms/ml against e. aerogenes. the site of infection was the right side of the heart in 11 patients, the left side in five, and both sides in one. the mean number of days to defervescence was 9.7. all patients were cured, and none required cardiac surgery. adverse effects were few and interrupted treatment occurred in only one  patient who had acute dyspnea during an infusion on day 26 of therapy. imipenem/cilastatin appears to be a relatively safe and highly effective treatment of staphylococcal endocarditis in intravenous drug users; too few patients with endocarditis caused by other bacteria were treated to allow a firm  statement about efficacy in non-staphylococcal endocarditis.
