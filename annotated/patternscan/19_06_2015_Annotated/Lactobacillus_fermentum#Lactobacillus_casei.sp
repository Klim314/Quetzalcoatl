TI  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 lactobacillus and three bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (ph 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; cfs) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; cfw) from de man-rogosa-sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. acid cfs and cfw showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against c. albicans. neutralized cfs/cfw assays showed six strains active against s. aureus (l. acidophilus l-1, l. brevis 1, l. fermentum 1, b. animalis subsp. lactis l-3), e. coli (l. bulgaricus 6) or b. cereus (l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic). inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized cfs (l. bulgaricus 6, l. helveticus 3, l. plantarum 24-2l, l. fermentum 1)/cfw (l. plantarum 24-5d, l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic) was detected. some strains maintained activity after ph neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. the antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were  determined by the epsilometer test method. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (l. rhamnosus lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (l. acidophilus l-1 and l. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; l.  casei l-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). vancomycin mics > 256 mug/ml indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. the antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance  transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.

TI  == examination of the technological properties of newly isolated strains of the genus and possibilities for their application in the composition of starters.
AB  == the ability of four lactobacillus strains - lactobacillus brevis lbrz7 (isolated  from fermented cabbage), lactobacillus plantarum lbrz12 (isolated from fermented  cabbage), lactobacillus fermentum lbrh9 (of human origin) and lactobacillus casei ssp. rhamnosus lbrc11 (isolated from home-made cheese) - to grow in flour/water environment and to accumulate high concentrations of viable cells was examined. two starters for sourdough were created for lab-scale production of wheat bread:  a two-strain starter and a four-strain starter. wheat bread with improved properties - greater loaf volume, enhanced flavour and softer and brighter crumb  - was obtained from the 7% four-strain starter sourdough. the addition of sourdough in the production of wheat bread affected positively the technological  and organoleptic characteristics of the final bread by inhibiting the growth of wild yeasts and mold and bacillus spores without the addition of preservatives. the inclusion of 15% of the four-strain starter sourdough in the bread-making process led to enhanced safety and longer shelf life of the baked bread.

TI  == an assessment of adhesion, aggregation and surface charges of lactobacillus strains derived from the human oral cavity.
AB  == there is limited information concerning the adhesion and aggregation of human oral lactobacilli. in this study, the adhesion of 10 lactobacillus species was investigated using h357 oral keratinocyte cells as an in vitro model for oral mucosa. coaggregation with the representative oral pathogen, streptococcus mutans atcc 25175, and the physicochemical cell properties was also evaluated. the results demonstrated significant variations in adhesion (42-96%) and aggregation  (autoaggregation, 14-95%; coaggregation, 19-65%). all strains showed a high affinity for chloroform, and most strains had a moderate-to-high hydrophobicity.  all strains, except lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus gasseri, showed a moderate affinity for ethyl acetate. there was a strong association of autoaggregation with coaggregation (rs = 0.883, p < 0.001). the highest mean for  autoaggregation (74%) and coaggregation (47%) belonged to the lact. gasseri strains. correlations between the adhesion and surface characteristics and aggregation were observed among the lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus paracasei strains; however, there was a variation in the strains properties within and between species. this study indicated that the lact. gasseri, lact. fermentum, and lact. paracasei strains might be potential probiotics for the human oral cavity given their desirable properties. it should also be emphasized  that a selective process for probiotic strains is required. significance and impact of the study: adhesion to host tissues and bacterial aggregation (auto- and coaggregation) are the highly important criteria for selecting strains with probiotic potential. these abilities are commonly involved with surface-charged characteristics. this is the first study to investigate the oral lactobacillus species using an oral keratinocyte cell line. significant results were found for  the correlations between the adhesion and surface charge characteristics and for  aggregation among certain strains of lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus paracasei. this observation could be useful when collecting background information for the selection of probiotic strains for use  in oral health.

TI  == amelioration of ovalbumin induced allergic symptoms in balb/c mice by potentially probiotic strains of lactobacilli.
AB  == to evaluate the antiallergic effect of newly characterised probiotic strains, lactobacillus fermentum nws29, lactobacillus casei nwp08 and lactobacillus rhamnosus nwp13, mice were divided into six experimental groups: control, ovalbumin (ova), nws29, nwp08, nwp13 and l. rhamnosus gg (lgg). mice were immunised and probiotics were administered via oral gavage followed by challenge  with ova. after last challenge with ova, inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (balf), recruitment of inflammatory cells in airways and ova-specific immunoglobulin e (ige) in serum were determined by giemsa, haematoxylin and eosin (he) staining, and elisa, respectively. relative mrna expression of interleukins (il-4, il-5, il-10, il-13 and il-17), transforming growth factor-beta (tgf-beta) and interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma) in lung and spleen tissue was determined by real time rt-pcr. ova-specific ige levels, recruitment of eosinophils and mrna expressions of inflammatory cytokines were remarkably increased in ova-exposed mice compared with the control group. administration of  nws29 and nwp13 suppressed inflammatory cell infiltration in airways and balf, and level of ova-specific ige in serum of ova-exposed mice. furthermore, nws29 and nwp13 also abrogated the mrna expression of 1l-4, il-5, il-13 and tgf-beta in mice immunised and exposed to ova. our findings suggest that nws29 and nwp13 might be good candidates for the prevention of allergic airway inflammation.

TI  == probiotic and technological properties of lactobacillus spp. strains from the human stomach in the search for potential candidates against gastric microbial dysbiosis.
AB  == this work characterizes a set of lactobacilli strains isolated from the stomach of healthy humans that might serve as probiotic cultures. ten different strains were recognized by rep-pcr and pfge fingerprinting among 19 isolates from gastric biopsies and stomach juice samples. these strains belonged to five species, lactobacillus gasseri (3), lactobacillus reuteri (2), lactobacillus vaginalis (2), lactobacillus fermentum (2) and lactobacillus casei (1). all ten strains were subjected to a series of in vitro tests to assess their functional and technological properties, including acid resistance, bile tolerance, adhesion to  epithelial gastric cells, production of antimicrobial compounds, inhibition of helicobacter pylori, antioxidative activity, antibiotic resistance, carbohydrate  fermentation, glycosidic activities, and ability to grow in milk. as expected, given their origin, all strains showed good resistance to low ph (3.0), with small reductions in counts after 90 min exposition to this ph. species- and strain-specific differences were detected in terms of the production of antimicrobials, antagonistic effects toward h. pylori, antioxidative activity and adhesion to gastric epithelial cells. none of the strains showed atypical resistance to a series of 16 antibiotics of clinical and veterinary importance. two l. reuteri strains were deemed as the most appropriate candidates to be used  as potential probiotics against microbial gastric disorders; these showed good survival under gastrointestinal conditions reproduced in vitro, along with strong anti-helicobacter and antioxidative activities. the two l. reuteri strains further displayed appropriated technological traits for their inclusion as adjunct functional cultures in fermented dairy products.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from brazilian water buffalo mozzarella cheese.
AB  == the water buffalo mozzarella cheese is a typical italian cheese which has been introduced in the thriving brazilian market in the last 10 y, with good acceptance by its consumers. lactic acid bacteria (lab) play an important role in the technological and sensory quality of mozzarella cheese. in this study, the aim was to evaluate the diversity of the autochthones viable lab isolated from water buffalo mozzarella cheese under storage. samples were collected in 3 independent trials in a dairy industry located in the southeast region of brazil, on the 28th day of storage, at 4 masculinec. the lab were characterized by gram staining, catalase test, capacity to assimilate citrate, and production of co2 from glucose. the diversity of lab was evaluated by rapd-pcr (randomly amplified  polymorphic dna-polymerase chain reaction), 16s rrna gene sequencing, and by vitek 2 system. twenty lab strains were isolated and clustered into 12 different  clusters, and identified as streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and lactobacillus helveticus. enterococcus species were dominant and  citrate-positive. only the strains of l. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and l. fermentum produced co2 from glucose and were citrate-positive, while l. casei  was only citrate positive. this is the first report which elucidates the lab diversity involved in brazilian water buffalo mozzarella cheese. furthermore, the results show that despite the absence of natural whey cultures as starters in production, the lab species identified are the ones typically found in mozzarella cheese.

TI  == the influence of the wooden equipment employed for cheese manufacture on the characteristics of a traditional stretched cheese during ripening.
AB  == the influence of the wooden equipment used for the traditional cheese manufacturing from raw milk was evaluated on the variations of chemico-physical characteristics and microbial populations during the ripening of caciocavallo palermitano cheese. milk from two farms (a, extensive; b, intensive) was processed in traditional and standard conditions. chemical and physical traits of cheeses were affected by the farming system and the cheese making technology, and changed during ripening. content in nacl and n soluble was lower, and paste consistency higher in cheese from the extensive farm and traditional technology,  whereas ripening increased the n soluble and the paste yellow and consistency. the ripening time decreased the number of all lactic acid bacteria (lab) groups,  except enterococci detected at approximately constant levels (10(4) and 10(5) cfu g(-1) for standard and traditional cheeses, respectively), till 120 d of ripening. in all productions, at each ripening time, the levels detected for enterococci were lower than those for the other lab groups. the canonical discriminant analysis of chemical, physical and microbiological data was able to  separate cheeses from different productions and ripening time. the dominant lab were isolated, phenotypically characterised and grouped, genetically differentiated at strain level and identified. ten species of lab were found and  the strains detected at the highest levels were pediococcus acidilactici and lactobacillus casei. ten strains, mainly belonging to lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus fermentum showed an antibacterial activity. the comparison of the polymorphic profiles of the lab strains isolated from the wooden vat with those of the strains collected during maturation, showed the persistence of three enterococci in traditional cheeses, with enterococcus faecalis found at dominant  levels over the enterococcus population till 120 d; the absence of these strains  in the standard productions evidenced the contribution of vat lab during caciocavallo palermitano cheese ripening.

TI  == unpasteurised commercial boza as a source of microbial diversity.
AB  == boza is a cereal-based fermented beverage widely consumed in many countries of the balkans. the aim of this study was to investigate the microbiota of three bulgarian boza samples through a combination of culture-dependent and -independent methods with the long-term objective of formulating a multi-strain starter culture specifically destined for the manufacture of new cereal-based drinks. the isolation campaign for lactic acid bacteria (lab) allowed the identification of lactobacillus parabuchneri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus coryniformis, lactobacillus buchneri, pediococcus parvulus and members of the lactobacillus casei group. concerning yeasts, the following isolates were identified: pichia fermentans, pichia norvegensis, pichia guilliermondii (synonym meyerozyma guilliermondii) and torulaspora spp. a high intra-species diversity was revealed by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) analysis. in parallel, microbial dna was directly extracted from the three boza samples, and portions of the rrn operons were analysed through polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge). the molecular fingerprinting partially confirmed the results of culturing. among lab, the species weissella confusa, weissella oryzae, leuconostoc citreum, lactococcus lactis, pediococcus parvulus and pediococcus ethanolidurans were detected together with members of the lb. casei group. among the yeasts, the species p. fermentans, m. guilliermondii, galactomyces geotrichum and geotrichum fragrans were found. the overall results confirmed boza as having a rich and heterogeneous biodiversity both in terms of species and genetically diverse strains, thus encouraging its exploitation for the isolation and future technological characterisation of cultures to be selected for the manufacture of innovative cereal-based drinks.

TI  == effect of the bread-making process on zearalenone levels.
AB  == the effects of the bread-making process including fermentation with saccharomyces cerevisiae and lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus fermentum) and baking at 200 degrees c on zearalenone (zea) levels were investigated. standard solutions of zea were added to flour and then loaves of bread were prepared. sourdough and  three types of yeast including active dry yeast, instant dry yeast and compressed yeast were used for the fermentation of dough. zea levels in flour, dough and bread were determined by hplc with fluorescence detection after extraction and clean-up on an immunoaffinity column. the highest reduction in levels of zea was  found in the first fermentation (first proof), while the lowest reduction was observed in the baking stage. in addition, the results showed that compressed yeast had the maximum reduction potential on zea levels even at the baking stage.

TI  == heat-killed probiotic bacteria differentially regulate colonic epithelial cell production of human beta-defensin-2: dependence on inflammatory cytokines.
AB  == the inducible antimicrobial peptide human beta-defensin-2 (hbd-2) stimulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and bacterial products is essential to antipathogen responses of gut epithelial cells. commensal and probiotic bacteria can augment such mucosal defences. probiotic use in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, however, may have adverse effects, boosting inflammatory responses. the  aim of this investigation was to determine the effect of selected probiotic strains on hbd-2 production by epithelial cells induced by pathologically relevant pro-inflammatory cytokines and the role of cytokine modulators in controlling hbd-2. caco-2 colonic intestinal epithelial cells were pre-incubated  with heat-killed probiotics, i.e. lactobacillus casei strain shirota (lcs) or lactobacillus fermentum strain ms15 (lf), followed by stimulation of hbd-2 by interleukin (il)-1beta and tumour necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) in the absence or presence of exogenous il-10 or anti-il-10 neutralising antibody. cytokines and hbd-2 mrna and protein were analysed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. lcs augmented il-1beta-induced hbd-2, whereas lf enhanced tnf-alpha- and suppressed il-1beta-induced hbd-2. lf enhanced tnf-alpha-induced tnf-alpha and suppressed il-10, whereas augmented il-1beta-induced il-10. lcs upregulated il-1beta-induced tnf-alpha mrna and suppressed il-10. endogenous il-10 differentially regulated hbd-2; neutralisation of il-10 augmented tnf-alpha- and suppressed il-1beta-induced hbd-2. exogenous il-10, however, suppressed both tnf-alpha- and  il-1beta-induced hbd-2; lcs partially rescued suppression in tnf-alpha- and il-1beta-stimulation, whereas lf further suppressed il-1beta-induced hbd-2. it can be concluded that probiotic strains differentially regulate hbd-2 mrna expression and protein secretion, modulation being dictated by inflammatory stimulus and resulting cytokine environment.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the probiotic and functional potential of lactobacillus strains isolated from fermented food and human intestine.
AB  == this study aims to evaluate the functional and probiotic characteristics of eight indigenous lactobacillus strains in vitro. the selected lactobacilli include strains of lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salicinius, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and lactobacillus rhamnosus. all strains tolerated both ph 2 for 3 h and 1% bile salt for 24 h. the strains cicc 23174 and cgmcc 1.557 were the most adhesive strains producing the highest quantity of eps. although a wide variation in the ability of the eight strains to deplete cholesterol and nitrite, antagonize pathogens, scavenge free radical, and stimulate innate immune response were observed, the strains cicc 23174 and cgmcc 1.557 showed the widest range of these useful traits. taken together, the strains cicc 23174 and cgmcc 1.557 exhibited the best probiotic properties with the potential for use in the production of probiotic fermented foods.

TI  == lactobacillus strains isolated from infant faeces possess potent inhibitory activity against intestinal alpha- and beta-glucosidases suggesting anti-diabetic potential.
AB  == purpose: inhibitors of intestinal alpha-glucosidases are used therapeutically to  treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. bacteria such as actinoplanes sp. naturally produce potent alpha-glucosidase inhibitor compounds, including the most widely available drug acarbose. it is not known whether lactic acid bacteria (lab) colonising the human gut possess inhibitory potential against glucosidases. hence, the study was undertaken to screen labs having inherent alpha- and beta-glucosidase inhibitory potential. methods: this study isolated, screened, identified and extracted lactobacillus strains (lb1-15) from human infant faecal  samples determining their inhibitory activity against intestinal maltase, sucrase, lactase and amylase. lactobacillus reference strains (ref1-7), a gram positive control (ctrl1) and two gram negative controls (ctrl2-3), were also analysed to compare activity. results: faecal isolates were identified by dna sequencing, with the majority identified as unique strains of lactobacillus plantarum. some strains (l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. casei and l. rhamnosus) had potent and broad spectrum inhibitory activities (up to 89%; p < 0.001; 500 mg/ml wet weight) comparable to acarbose (up to 88%; p < 0.001; 30 mg/ml). inhibitory activity was concentration-dependent and was freely available in the supernatant, and was not present in other bacterial genera (bifidobacterium bifidum and escherichia coli or salmonella typhimurium). interestingly, the potency and spectrum of inhibitory activity across strains of a single species (l. plantarum) differed substantially. some lactobacillus extracts had broader spectrum activities than acarbose, effectively inhibiting beta-glucosidase activity (lactase) as well as alpha-glucosidase activities (maltase, sucrase and  amylase). anti-diabetic potential was indicated by the fact that oral gavage with a l. rhamnosus extract (1 g/kg) was able to reduce glucose excursions (area under curve; 22%; p < 0.05) in rats during a carbohydrate challenge (starch; 2 g/kg). conclusion: these results definitively demonstrate that lactobacillus strains present in the human gut have alpha- and beta-glucosidase inhibitory activities and can reduce blood glucose responses in vivo. although the potential use of lab such as lactobacillus as a dietary supplement, medicinal food or biotherapeutic for diabetes is uncertain, such an approach might offer advantages over drug therapies in terms of broader spectrum activities and fewer unpleasant side effects. further characterisation of this bioactivity is warranted, and chronic studies should be undertaken in appropriate animal models or diabetic subjects.

TI  == antifungal activity of lactobacilli and its relationship with 3-phenyllactic acid production.
AB  == in this study, 13 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains (including 5 lactobacillus casei, 2 lactobacillus rhamnosus, 2 lactobacillus fermentum, 1 lactobacillus acidophilus, 1 lactobacillus plantarum, 1 lactobacillus sakei, and 1 lactobacillus reuteri species) were assessed for both their antifungal activity against four food spoilage molds (colletotrichum gloeosporioides, botrytis cinerea, penicillium expansum, and aspergillus flavus) and their capability to produce the novel antimicrobial compound 3-phenyllactic acid (pla). results demonstrated that all molds were sensitive to varying degrees to the cell-free supernatants (cfs) from lab fermentations (p<0.05), with growth inhibitions ranging from 2.65% to 66.82%. the inhibition ability of cfs was not affected by a heating treatment (121 degrees c, 20 min); however, it declined markedly when the ph of cfs was adjusted to 6.5. with the exception of l. plantarum nrrl b-4496 and l. acidophilus atcc-4495, all other lab strains produced pla ranging from 0.021 to 0.275 mm. the high minimum inhibitory concentration for commercial pla (3.01-36.10mm) suggests that it cannot be considered the only compound related with the antifungal potential of studied lab and that synergistic effects may exist among other metabolism products.

TI  == characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from infant faeces as potential probiotic starter cultures for fermented sausages.
AB  == a total of 109 lactic acid bacteria isolated from infant faeces were identified by partial 16s rrna, cpn60 and/or phes sequencing. lactobacillus was the most prevalent genus, representing 48% of the isolates followed by enterococcus (38%). lactobacillus gasseri (21%) and enterococcus faecalis (38%) were the main species detected. a further selection of potential probiotic starter cultures for fermented sausages focused on lactobacillus as the most technologically relevant  genus in this type of product. lactobacilli strains were evaluated for their ability to grow in vitro in the processing conditions of fermented sausages and for their functional and safety properties, including antagonistic activity against foodborne pathogens, survival from gastrointestinal tract conditions (acidity, bile and pancreatin), tyramine production, antibiotic susceptibility and aggregation capacity. the best strains according to the results obtained were lactobacillus casei/paracasei ctc1677, l. casei/paracasei ctc1678, lactobacillus  rhamnosus ctc1679, l. gasseri ctc1700, l. gasseri ctc1704, lactobacillus fermentum ctc1693. those strains were further assayed as starter cultures in model sausages. l. casei/paracasei ctc1677, l. casei/paracasei ctc1678 and l. rhamnosus ctc1679 were able to lead the fermentation and dominate (levels ca. 10(8) cfu/g) the endogenous lactic acid bacteria, confirming their suitability as probiotic starter cultures.

TI  == tailoring the probiotic potential of non-starter lactobacillus strains from ripened parmigiano reggiano cheese by in vitro screening and principal component  analysis.
AB  == non-starter lactic acid bacteria (nslab) inhabiting fermented food have been recently revised as source of probiotic strains. here, we in vitro assessed the potential probiotic aptitude of a de-replicated set of nslab previously isolated  from long ripened parmigiano reggiano cheeses (22 lactobacillus rhamnosus, 18 lactobacillus paracasei, 3 lactobacillus casei, 2 lactobacillus harbinensis, and  2 lactobacillus fermentum). most strains showed moderate to good resistance to biological barriers, including bile salts, lysozyme, and simulated gastric and pancreatic juices. antimicrobial susceptibility tests against seven antimicrobials belonging to different categories showed that most strains are susceptible towards all the antibiotics, with the exception of vancomycin and streptomycin. the strains lost the streptomycin resistance when assayed on agar medium containing 0.5% bile salts, suggesting that detergent-like properties of cholic acids increase membrane permeability and mediate streptomycin susceptibility. no isolate showed bile salt hydrolase (bsh) activities, supporting that bile salts resistance and bsh activity are unpaired traits. finally, nslab strains had moderate to high auto-aggregative and hydrophobic phenotypes, whereas two subsets of 22 and 8 strains co-aggregated with escherichia coli and salmonella enterica s. typhimurium, respectively. a multivariate analysis was effective to segregate one l. casei and two l. rhamnosus strains showing physiological characteristics compatible with probiotic properties.

TI  == molecular identification of lactobacillus spp. associated with puba, a brazilian  fermented cassava food.
AB  == puba or carima is a brazilian staple food obtained by spontaneous submerged fermentation of cassava roots. a total of 116 lactobacilli and three cocci isolates from 20 commercial puba samples were recovered on de man, rogosa and sharpe agar (mrs); they were characterized for their antagonistic activity against foodborne pathogens and identified taxonomically by classical and molecular methods. in all samples, lactic acid bacteria were recovered as the dominant microbiota (7.86 +/- 0.41 log10 cfu/g). 16s-23s rrna ardra pattern assigned 116 isolates to the lactobacillus genus, represented by the species lactobacillus fermentum (59 isolates), lactobacillus delbrueckii (18 isolates), lactobacillus casei (9 isolates), lactobacillus reuteri (6 isolates), lactobacillus brevis (3 isolates), lactobacillus gasseri (2 isolates), lactobacillus nagelii (1 isolate), and lactobacillus plantarum group (18 isolates). reca gene-multiplex pcr analysis revealed that l. plantarum group isolates belonged to lactobacillus plantarum (15 isolates) and lactobacillus paraplantarum (3 isolates). genomic diversity was investigated by molecular typing with rep (repetitive sequence)-based pcr using the primer eric2 (enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus). the lactobacillus isolates exhibited genetic heterogeneity and species-specific fingerprint patterns. all the isolates showed antagonistic activity against the foodborne pathogenic bacteria tested. this antibacterial effect was attributed to acid production, except in the cases of three isolates that apparently produced bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances. this study provides the first insight into the genetic diversity of lactobacillus spp. of puba.

TI  == role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  == meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical mrsa isolates, we conducted a literature  search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment  of s. aureus infection. as summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of s. aureus and clinical isolates of mrsa in vitro. the most active strains were lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, propionibacterium freudenreichii, propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus paracasei, l. acidophilus, l. casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus fermentum and lactococcus lactis. their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. l. acidophilus also inhibited s. aureus biofilm formation and lipase  production. in vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. s. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in  vitro to l. acidophilus, whilst in vivo bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. on the other hand, l. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against s. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with  s. aureus in mice. very few clinical data were found on the interactions between  probiotics and mrsa, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of mrsa colonisation with probiotic use.

TI  == lactobacillus species isolated from vaginal secretions of healthy and bacterial vaginosis-intermediate mexican women: a prospective study.
AB  == background: lactobacillus jensenii, l. iners, l. crispatus and l. gasseri are the most frequently occurring lactobacilli in the vagina. however, the native species vary widely according to the studied population. the present study was performed  to genetically determine the identity of lactobacillus strains present in the vaginal discharge of healthy and bacterial vaginosis (bv) intermediate mexican women. methods: in a prospective study, 31 strains preliminarily identified as lactobacillus species were isolated from 21 samples collected from 105 non-pregnant mexican women. the samples were classified into groups according to  the nugent score criteria proposed for detection of bv: normal (n), intermediate  (i) and bacterial vaginosis (bv). we examined the isolates using culture-based methods as well as molecular analysis of the v1-v3 regions of the 16s rrna gene.  enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (eric) sequence analysis was performed to reject clones. results: clinical isolates (25/31) were classified into four groups based on sequencing and analysis of the 16s rrna gene: l. acidophilus (14/25), l. reuteri (6/25), l. casei (4/25) and l. buchneri (1/25). the remaining six isolates were presumptively identified as enterococcus species. within the l. acidophilus group, l. gasseri was the most frequently isolated species, followed by l. jensenii and l. crispatus. l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus and l. brevis were also isolated, and were placed in the l. reuteri, l. casei and l.  buchneri groups, respectively. eric profile analysis showed intraspecific variability amongst the l. gasseri and l. fermentum species. conclusions: these findings agree with previous studies showing that l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l. jensenii are consistently present in the healthy vaginal ecosystem. additional species or phylotypes were detected in the vaginal microbiota of the non-pregnant mexican (hispanic-mestizo) population, and thus, these results further our understanding of vaginal lactobacilli colonisation and richness in this particular population.

TI  == stable integration and expression of heterologous genes in several lactobacilli using an integration vector constructed from the integrase and attp sequences of  phage phiat3 isolated from lactobacillus casei atcc 393.
AB  == an integration vector capable of stably integrating and maintaining in the chromosomes of several lactobacilli over hundreds of generations has been constructed. the major integration machinery used is based on the phiat3 integrase (int) and attp sequences determined previously. a novel core sequence located at the 3' end of the trna(leu) gene is identified in lactobacillus fermentum atcc 14931 as the integration target by the integration vector though most of such sequences found in other lactobacilli are similar to that determined previously. due to the lack of an appropriate attb site in lactococcus lactis mg1363, the integration vector is found to be unable to integrate into the chromosome of the strain. however, such integration can be successfully restored  by cotransforming the integration vector with a replicative one harboring both attb and erythromycin resistance sequences into the strain. furthermore, the integration vector constructed carries a promoter region of plact from the chromosome of lactobacillus rhamnosus tcell-1 which is used to express green fluorescence and luminance protein genes in the lactobacilli studied.

TI  == development of bacteria identification array to detect lactobacilli in thai fermented sausage.
AB  == to improve the quality and safety of food products, there is a need in the food industry for a reliable method for simultaneously monitoring multiple bacterial strains. microarray technology is a high-throughput screening approach that can provide an alternative for bacteria detection. a total of 164 bacteria-specific probes were designed from 16s rrna gene sequences to target 12 bacteria species,  including lactic acid bacteria and selected food pathogens. after fabrication onto aminosilane-coated slides, hybridization conditions of the array were optimized for high specificity and signal intensities. the array was applied to detect 12 bacteria individually and was specific to all (lactobacillus plantarum  group, l. fermentum, l. brevis, l. delbrueckii, l. casei, l. sakei, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus and listeria monocytogenes) except l. animalis. multiplex detection using mixed bacteria populations was evaluated and accurate detection was obtained. the feasibility of using the array to detect the target bacteria in food was evaluated with thai fermented sausages  (nham). meat samples were collected on days 2, 3 and 7 after natural fermentation, l. plantarum-inoculated fermentation and l. brevis-inoculated fermentation before applying to the array. the naturally-fermented nham contained l. sakei, l. delbrueckii, l. plantarum and l. fermentum. the l. plantarum-inoculated nham showed a similar lactic acid bacteria population but the positive signal level for l. plantarum was higher than with natural fermentation. the l. brevis-inoculated nham contained l. brevis, l. plantarum, l. delbrueckii and l. fermentum. the array was used to monitor bacteria population dynamics during the fermentation process. the naturally-fermented and l. brevis-inoculated samples showed lower positive signal levels of l. plantarum on  day 2, but signals gradually increased on days 3 and 7 of the fermentation. in contrast, the l. plantarum-started fermentation showed a higher positive signal level on day 2 than the natural and l. brevis-inoculated samples, and the positive signal level remained high on days 3 and 7. the bacteria identification  array was proven to be useful as an alternative method to detect and monitor target bacteria populations during food fermentation.

TI  == fermentation of sugars and sugar alcohols by plaque lactobacillus strains.
AB  == objective: the objective was to analyse the ability of lactobacillus strains isolated from supragingival plaque of subjects with hyposalivation and from healthy controls to ferment sugars and sugar alcohols. material and methods: fifty strains isolated from interproximal plaque from subjects with radiation-induced hyposalivation (25 strains), subjects with primary sjogren's syndrome (16 strains) and from subjects with normal salivary secretion rate (9 strains) were tested. growth and ph were determined after 24 and 48 h of anaerobic incubation in vials containing basal media with 1 % of glucose, fructose, sucrose, mannitol, sorbitol or xylitol. results: no differences between strains isolated from hyposalivated subjects and controls were detected. all strains lowered the ph to <5.0 from fructose and the majority of the strains from glucose and sucrose. a ph of <5.5 was seen for 52 % of the strains using mannitol, 50 % using sorbitol and 36 % using xylitol. the ability to produce acids from sugars and sugar alcohols was highest among strains of lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus paracasei and lowest among lactobacillus fermentum strains. conclusion: a large number of lactobacillus strains are able to ferment not only sugars but also the sugar substitutes mannitol, sorbitol and xylitol to ph levels critical for enamel demineralisation. clinical relevance: our findings suggest that products containing mannitol, sorbitol and/or xylitol may contribute to the acidogenic potential of the dental  plaque and especially in hyposalivated subjects with high numbers of lactobacilli.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of a spontaneous cocoa bean fermentation metagenome reveals new insights into its bacterial and fungal community diversity.
AB  == this is the first report on the phylogenetic analysis of the community diversity  of a single spontaneous cocoa bean box fermentation sample through a metagenomic  approach involving 454 pyrosequencing. several sequence-based and composition-based taxonomic profiling tools were used and evaluated to avoid software-dependent results and their outcome was validated by comparison with previously obtained culture-dependent and culture-independent data. overall, this approach revealed a wider bacterial (mainly gamma-proteobacteria) and fungal diversity than previously found. further, the use of a combination of different classification methods, in a software-independent way, helped to understand the actual composition of the microbial ecosystem under study. in addition, bacteriophage-related sequences were found. the bacterial diversity depended partially on the methods used, as composition-based methods predicted a wider diversity than sequence-based methods, and as classification methods based solely on phylogenetic marker genes predicted a more restricted diversity compared with  methods that took all reads into account. the metagenomic sequencing analysis identified hanseniaspora uvarum, hanseniaspora opuntiae, saccharomyces cerevisiae, lactobacillus fermentum, and acetobacter pasteurianus as the prevailing species. also, the presence of occasional members of the cocoa bean fermentation process was revealed (such as erwinia tasmaniensis, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and oenococcus oeni). furthermore, the sequence reads  associated with viral communities were of a restricted diversity, dominated by myoviridae and siphoviridae, and reflecting lactobacillus as the dominant host. to conclude, an accurate overview of all members of a cocoa bean fermentation process sample was revealed, indicating the superiority of metagenomic sequencing over previously used techniques.

AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to design and evaluate fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) probes for the single-cell detection and enumeration of lactic acid bacteria, in particular organisms belonging to the major phylogenetic groups and species of oral lactobacilli and to abiotrophia/granulicatella. results: as lactobacilli are known for notorious resistance to probe penetration, probe-specific assay protocols were experimentally developed to provide maximum cell wall permeability, probe accessibility, hybridization stringency, and fluorescence intensity. the new assays were then applied in a pilot study to three biofilm samples harvested from variably demineralized bovine enamel discs that had been carried in situ for 10 days by different volunteers. best probe penetration and fluorescent labeling of reference strains were obtained after combined lysozyme and achromopeptidase treatment followed by exposure to lipase.  hybridization stringency had to be established strictly for each probe. thereafter all probes showed the expected specificity with reference strains and  labeled the anticipated morphotypes in dental plaques. applied to in situ grown biofilms the set of probes detected only lactobacillus fermentum and bacteria of  the lactobacillus casei group. the most cariogenic biofilm contained two orders of magnitude higher l. fermentum cell numbers than the other biofilms. abiotrophia/granulicatella and streptococci from the mitis group were found in all samples at high levels, whereas streptococcus mutans was detected in only one sample in very low numbers. conclusions: application of these new group- and species-specific fish probes to oral biofilm-forming lactic acid bacteria will allow a clearer understanding of the supragingival biome, its spatial architecture and of structure-function relationships implicated during plaque homeostasis and caries development. the probes should prove of value far beyond the field of oral microbiology, as many of them detect non-oral species and phylogenetic groups of importance in a variety of medical conditions and the food industry.

TI  == phylogenomic reconstruction of lactic acid bacteria: an update.
AB  == background: lactic acid bacteria (lab) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. however, the phylogenetic relationships among lab species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. results: we performed a phylogenetic analysis of lab species based on 232 genes from 28 lab genome sequences. regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. the lab species examined were divided into two groups. group 1 included families enterococcaceae and streptococcaceae. group 2 included families lactobacillaceae and leuconostocaceae. within group 2, the lab species were divided into two clades. one clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus  lactobacillus and two other species, lb. sakei and lb. casei. in the acidophilus  complex, lb. delbrueckii separated first, while lb. acidophilus/lb. helveticus and lb. gasseri/lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. the other clade within group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, lb.  salivarius, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. reuteri, lb. fermentum, and the genera pediococcus, oenococcus, and leuconostoc. in this clade, lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to lb. plantarum/lb. brevis pair and pediococcus, and the other including oenococcus/leuconostoc pair and lb. reuteri/lb. fermentum pair. in addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be  more useful than others. the genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (trsb), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein b (uvrb), dna polymerase iii (polc) and penicillin binding protein 2b (pbpb). conclusions: our  phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of lab species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. we infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in lab species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. further analyses of more genes from additional, representative lab species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of lab species to various environmental niches.

TI  == protective effect of ssanghwa-tang fermented by lactobacillus fermentum against carbon tetrachloride-induced acute hepatotoxicity in rats.
AB  == ssanghwa-tang (sht) is a traditional herbal medicine formula that has been used for the development of physical strength, relief of pain, and the reduction of fatigue. in this study, we fermented sht with lactobacillus fermentum (l. fermentum), lactobacillus gasseri (l.gasseri), or lactobacillus casei (l.casei) to investigate the hepatoprotective effects of sht and fermented sht with lactobacillus on carbon tetrachloride (ccl(4))-induced liver injury in rats. rats were given ccl(4) (1 ml/kg, 50% ccl(4) in olive oil) intraperitoneally and either sht or fermented shts (15 ml/kg) was administered 30 min before ccl(4). at 24 hr  after ccl(4) injection, the levels of transaminases in the serum were markedly increased. these increases were significantly attenuated by either sht + l. fermentum or sht+ l.gasseri. however, sht and sht + l.casei showed slight suppression of the increase of transaminases. the liver histological changes were diminished by treatment with sht + l. fermentum. additionally, the potential hepatoprotective effect of fermented-shts correlated with the amount of unknown metabolite which is produced during fermentation process with l. fermentum, l.gasseri, or l.casei. therefore, these results suggest that the hepatoprotective effect of sht may be improved by fermentation with l. fermentum and the intestinal bacterial enzyme activities may likely play an important role in the pharmacological action of herbal medicines.

TI  == microbiota of dentinal caries as assessed by reverse-capture checkerboard analysis.
AB  == background/aims: this study aimed to identify the microbiota of different layers  of dentinal caries by using a culture-independent molecular biology approach. methods: dna was extracted from samples taken from 3 distinct layers (superficial, middle and deep) of advanced occlusal caries and analyzed for the presence and relative levels of 28 oral bacterial species/phylotypes using a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay. results: the mean number of target taxa per layer was 7.7 (+/- 3.96) in the superficial, 7 (+/- 3.4) in the middle, and 6.3 (+/- 3.04) in the deep layer. no statistical significance was observed for these differences (p = 0.36). overall, the most prevalent taxa in the 3 layers were atopobium genomospecies c1 (72.5%), fusobacterium nucleatum (69%), lactobacillus casei (68%), veillonella species (55%) and lactobacillus fermentum (52%). no differences were found in the prevalence rates of the most frequent target species in the 3 layers. the most prevalent taxa found at levels  above 10(5) in the advanced front line of deep-dentin caries were atopobium genomospecies c1, f. nucleatum, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus species and veillonella species. conclusion: the present results revealed that the prevalences of several established or candidate caries pathogens do not differ significantly in the different zones of dentinal caries lesions. the finding that some as-yet-uncharacterized species and novel species were found in high frequencies join other molecular studies to include them in the set of candidate  caries pathogens.

TI  == isoflavone phytoestrogens in soymilk fermented with beta-glucosidase producing probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == isoflavones significantly contribute to human health and disease prevention, and  exist as glucosides and aglycones. the beta-glucosidase enzyme that hydrolyzes glucosides to aglycones is very sensitive to molecular structure, and thus the profile of the isoflavones can affect their rate of hydrolysis. soymilk was fermented with lactobacillus acidophilus b4496 (la), lactobacillus bulgaricus cfr2028 (lb), lactobacillus casei b1922 (lc), lactobacillus plantarum b4495 (lp)  and lactobacillus fermentum b4655 (lf) for 48 h at 37 degrees c. beta-glucosidase activity was determined using p-nitrophenyl beta-d-glucopyranoside as a substrate and the hydrolysis was carried out in soymilk. during fermentation, maximum growth was seen at 24 h with lb, lc, lp and lf and at 48 h with la. polyphenol content ranged from 12.98 to 17.90 at 24 h and from 12.44 to 15.24 mg/100 ml at 48 h of fermentation. all the lactic acid bacteria produced beta-glucosidase enzyme, which hydrolyzed isoflavone glucosides to aglycones at a significant level (p < 0.05) in the fermented soymilk.

TI  == antibiotic resistance and molecular characterization of probiotic and clinical lactobacillus strains in relation to safety aspects of probiotics.
AB  == the evaluation of the safety of probiotic strains includes the exclusion of antibiotic resistance of clinical importance. ninety-two strains from the genus lactobacillus isolated from probiotics, food, and clinical sources were included  in the investigation. species tested were the l. acidophilus group, l. casei group, l. reuteri/fermentum group, and l. sakei/curvatus group. cell and colony morphology, fermentation patterns, and growth characteristics as well as soluble  whole cell proteins were analyzed. antibiotic resistance against clinically important agents was determined by broth dilution tests. the vana and tet genes were confirmed. resistances occurred mainly against gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, sulfonamides, and, in some cases, glycopeptides. the natural glycopeptide resistance within the l. casei group and l. reuteri appears to be not of clinical relevance, as there was no vana gene present. therefore, the transfer of this resistance is very unlikely. tet-(a), -(b), -(c), -(m), or -(o)  gene could not be detected. the protein fingerprinting within the l. casei group  proved that l. rhamnosus strains of clinical origin clustered together with probiotic strains. for safety evaluations resistance patterns of a broad range of strains are a useful criterion together with the exclusion of known resistance genes (like the vana gene) and can be used for decision making on the safety of probiotics, both by authorization bodies and manufacturers.

TI  == phytase activity from lactobacillus spp. in calcium-fortified soymilk.
AB  == the presence of phytate in calcium-fortified soymilk may interfere with mineral absorption. certain lactic acid bacteria (lab) produce the enzyme phytase that degrades phytates and therefore may potentially improve mineral bioavailability and absorption. this study investigates the phytase activity and phytate degradation potential of 7 strains of lab including: lactobacillus acidophilus atcc4962, atcc33200, atcc4356, atcc4161, l. casei ascc290, l. plantarum ascc276,  and l. fermentum vri-003. activity of these bacteria was examined both in screening media and in calcium-fortified soymilk supplemented with potassium phytate. most strains produced phytase under both conditions with l. acidophilus  atcc4161 showing the highest activity. phytase activity in fortified soymilk fermented with l. acidophilus atcc4962 and l. acidophilus atcc4161 increased by 85% and 91%, respectively, between 12 h and 24 h of fermentation. all strains expressed peak phytase activity at approximately ph 5. however, no phytate degradation could be observed.

TI  == phenolic acids and flavonoids in nonfermented and fermented red sorghum (sorghum  bicolor (l.) moench).
AB  == this study aimed to identify phenolic acids and flavonoids in the red sorghum variety pan 3860 and to determine changes in their concentrations during fermentation with lactobacilli. sorghum sourdoughs fermented with two binary strain combinations, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus casei or lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus reuteri , were compared to chemically acidified controls. four glycerol esters were tentatively identified, caffeoylglycerol, dicaffeoylglycerol, coumaroyl-caffeoylglycerol, and coumaroyl-feruloylglycerol, that have previously not been detected in sorghum. chemical acidification resulted in hydrolysis of phenolic acid esters and flavonoid glucosides. during lactic fermentation, phenolic acids, phenolic acid esters, and flavonoid glucosides were metabolized. analysis of ferulic acid, caffeic acid, and naringenin-glucoside contents in single-strain cultures of lactobacilli demonstrated that glucosidase, phenolic acid reductase, and phenolic acid decarboxylase activities contributed to polyphenol metabolism. this study demonstrates that microbial fermentation of sorghum affects the content of polyphenols and can influence the nutritional value and antimicrobial activity of sorghum.

TI  == intestinal lactobacillus sp. is associated with some cellular and metabolic characteristics of blood in elderly people.
AB  == the higher counts or particular groups (firmicutes/bacteroidetes) of intestinal microbiota are related to host metabolic reactions, supporting a balance of human ecosystem. we further explored whether intestinal lactobacilli were associated with some principal cellular and metabolic markers of blood in 38 healthy >65-year-old persons. the questionnaire, routine clinical and laboratory data of  blood indices as much as the oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-ldl) and baseline diene conjugates in low-density lipoprotein (bdc-ldl) of blood sera were explored. the pcr-based intestinal lactobacillus sp. composition and counts of cultivable lactobacilli (lab) were tested. the facultative heterofermentative lactobacilli (lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus paracasei) were the most frequent (89 and 97%, respectively) species found, while lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus reuteri were present in almost half of the elderly persons. the number of species simultaneously colonizing the individuals ranged from 1 to 7 (median 4). in elderly consuming probiotics the lab counts were significantly higher than in these not consuming (median 7.8, range 4.2-10.8 vs. median 6.3, range 3.3-9.7 log cfu/g; p=0.005), adjusted (or=1.71, ci95 1.04-2.82; p=0.035) for age and body mass index (bmi). the colonization by l. acidophilus was negatively related (r=-0.367, p=0.0275) to l. reuteri, staying significant after adjusting for age, sex and bmi (or=0.16, ci95 0.04-0.73; p=0.018). however, the blood glucose concentration showed a tendency for a negative correlation for colonization with lactobacillus fermentum (r=-0.309, p=0.062) adjusted for bmi (adj. r(2)=0.181; p=0.013) but not for age and sex. the higher white blood cells (wbc) count was positively related (r=0.434, p=0.007) to presence of lactobacillus reuteri adjusted for age, sex and bmi (adj. r(2)=0.193, p=0.027). the lower values of ox-ldl were predicted by higher counts of cultivable lactobacilli adjusted by sex, age and bmi (r = -0.389, p = 0.016; adj. r(2)=0.184 p=0.029). in conclusion, the pilot study of elderly persons shows that the intestinal lactobacilli are tightly associated with wbc count, blood glucose and content of ox-ldl which all serve as risk markers in pathogenesis of inflammation, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease (cvd).

TI  == characterization of a novel lysm domain from lactobacillus fermentum bacteriophage endolysin and its use as an anchor to display heterologous proteins on the surfaces of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the endolysin lyb5, from lactobacillus fermentum temperate bacteriophage phipyb5, showed a broad lytic spectrum against gram-positive as well as gram-negative bacteria. sequence analysis revealed that the c terminus of the endolysin lyb5 (ly5c) contained three putative lysin motif (lysm) repeat regions, implying that  ly5c was involved in bacterial cell wall binding. to investigate the potential of ly5c for surface display, green fluorescent protein (gfp) was fused to ly5c at its n or c terminus and the resulting fusion proteins were expressed in escherichia coli. after being mixed with various cells in vitro, gfp was successfully displayed on the surfaces of lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus casei, lb. brevis, lb. plantarum, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, lb. helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus cells. increases in the fluorescence intensities of chemically pretreated l. lactis and lb. casei cells compared to those of nonpretreated cells suggested that the peptidoglycan was the binding ligand for ly5c. moreover, the ph and concentration of sodium chloride were optimized to enhance the binding capacity of gfp-ly5c, and high-intensity fluorescence of cells was observed under optimal conditions. all results suggested that ly5c was  a novel anchor for constructing a surface display system for lactic acid bacteria (lab). to demonstrate the applicability of the ly5c-mediated surface display system, beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) from paenibacillus sp. strain k1, replacing gfp, was functionally displayed on the surfaces of lab cells via ly5c. the success in surface display of gfp and beta-gal opened up the feasibility of employing the cell wall anchor of bacteriophage endolysin for surface display in  lab.

AB  == this study aimed to examine the potential antiviral activity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) using animal and human intestinal and macrophage cell line models  of non tumor origin. to this end, lab strains selected on the basis of previous in vitro trials were co-incubated with cell line monolayers, which were subsequently challenged with rotavirus (rv) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (tgev). in order to elucidate the possible mechanism responsible for the antiviral activity, the induction of reactive oxygen species (ros) release as well as the attachment ability of lab on the cell lines was investigated. various strains were found to exhibit moderate to complete monolayer protection against viral rv or tgev disruption. highest protection effects were recorded with the known probiotics lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactobacillus casei shirota against both rv and tgev, while notable antiviral activity was also attributed to enterococcus faecium pck38, lactobacillus fermentum aca-dc179, lactobacillus pentosus pca227 and lactobacillus plantarum pca236 and pcs22, depending on the cell line and virus combination used. a variable increase (of up to 50%) on the release of no(-) and h(2)o(2) (ros) was obtained when lab strains were co-incubated with the cell lines, but the results were found to be lab strain and cell line specific, apart from a small number of strains which were able to induce strong ros release in more than one cell line. in contrast, the ability of the examined lab strains to attach to the cell line monolayers was lab strain but not cell line specific. highest attachment ability was observed with l. plantarum aca-dc 146, l. paracasei subsp. tolerans aca-dc 4037 and e. faecium pcd71. clear  indications on the nature of the antiviral effect were evident only in the case of the l. casei shirota against tgev and with l. plantarum pca236 against both rv and tgev. in the rest of the cases, each interaction was lab-cell line-virus specific, barring general conclusions. however, it is probable that more than one mechanism is involved in the antiviral effect described here. further investigations are required to elucidate the underlying mode of action and to develop a cell line model as a system for selection of probiotic strains suited for farm animal applications.

TI  == characterization of a cryptic plasmid pd403 from lactobacillus plantarum and construction of shuttle vectors based on its replicon.
AB  == a cryptic plasmid pd403 was isolated from lactobacillus plantarum d403 derived from fermented dairy products. it was 2,791 bp in size with a g+c content of 37%. nucleotide sequence analysis revealed two open reading frames, orf1 and orf2. orf1 (318 amino acids) was identified as a replication protein (repa). orf2 (137  amino acids) shared 31% similarity with the transcriptional regulator of ralstonia pickettii 12d. functional investigation indicated that orf2 (tra) had the ability of improving the transformation efficiency. the origin of replication was predicted, suggesting that pd403 was a rolling-circle-replication (rcr) plasmid. an escherichia coli/lactobacillus shuttle vector pcd4032 was constructed based on the pd403 replicon, and proved to be successfully transformed into various lactobacilli including lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus brevis. the transformation efficiencies were ranged from 1.3 x 10(2) to 7 x 10(4) transformants per microgram dna. furthermore, an expression vector pcd4033 was developed with the promoter of the lactate dehydrogenase from lactobacillus delbrueckii 11842. the green fluorescent protein (gfp) as a reporter was expressed successfully in various lactobacilli tested, suggesting that the expression vector pcd4033 had the potential to be used as a molecular tool for heterologous gene cloning and expression in lactobacilli.

TI  == oral lactobacillus species in type 2 diabetic patients living in southern thailand.
AB  == although lactobacilli are part of normal oral, gastrointestinal and genitourinary flora, they are an uncommon cause of infections in human. lactobacillus-associated infections have generally occurred in patients with serious underlying conditions e.g. diabetes and cancer that might favour certain  microorganisms. the aim of this study was to characterize species and genotypes of lactobacilli isolated from diabetic patients and non-diabetic subjects. one hundred and five type 2 diabetic patients and 103 non-diabetic subjects were recruited in this study. a total of 170 isolates of lactobacillus were identified using 16s rrna gene pcr-rflp and genotyping were performed using ap-pcr by eric primers. it was found that type 2 diabetic patients had a significantly higher prevalence (p = 0.008) and level of lactobacilli than non-diabetic controls (p =  0.030). the most frequently isolated lactobacillus spp. were l. casei/paracasei and l. fermentum in both the diabetic and non-diabetic groups. strains of l. casei/paracasei and l. fermentum from between and within individuals were genotyped, and the genotyping of lactobacillus strains showed diversity between individuals. one up to three genotypes of these two species could be found in the same subject. interestingly, fewer genotypes were found in the diabetic patients  than in the non-diabetic subjects.

TI  == aflatoxin b1 binding capacity of autochthonous strains of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == some foods are prone to contamination with aflatoxins, with detrimental effect on human health. lactic acid bacteria have been reported to bind aflatoxins and remove them from foods and feeds. reduction of aflatoxin b1 (afb1) from the liquid media by the autochthonous lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus fermentum) isolated from traditional iranian sourdough and dairy products is reported in the current study. the effect of incubation time on the binding capacity of the strains to afb1 was also investigated. duplicates of individual bacteria with population equivalent to 2 x 10(10) cfu/ml were incubated in the presence of afb1 at 37 degrees c for a period of 72 h, and the amounts of unbound afb1 were quantitated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. all the strains were capable of removal of afb1, and the reduction of afb1 ranged from 25 to 61% throughout the incubation period. removal of afb1 was a rapid process, with approximately 61 and 56% of the toxin taken instantly by l. fermentum and l. plantarum, respectively.  binding was of a reversible nature, and some of the bound afb1 was released into  the media by the repeated centrifugation and resuspension of the cell pellets. the stability of the bacteria-toxin complex was strain dependent, and l. casei was a stronger binder of afb1 compared with the other bacteria. no toxin release  was observed after 24 h. these findings tend to suggest that certain novel probiotic bacteria with high aflatoxin binding capacity could be selected for detoxification of foods.

TI  == screening of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria for potential probiotic use  in iberian dry fermented sausages.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to select lactic acid bacteria and bifibobacteria strains as potential probiotic cultures during the processing of iberian dry fermented sausages. a total of 1000 strains were isolated from iberian dry fermented sausages (363), and human (337) and pig faeces (300) in different culture media. around 30% of these strains, mainly isolated from iberian dry fermented sausages in lamvab agar, were pre-selected for testing as potential probiotics by their ability to grow adequately at the ph values and nacl concentrations of these meat products during the ripening process. of the in vitro investigations used to predict the survival of a strain in conditions present in the gastro intestinal tract, exposure to ph 2.5 showed itself to be a  highly discriminating factor with only 51 out of 312 pre-selected strains resisting adequately after 1.5h of exposure. all acid-resistant isolates identified as lactobacilli originated from human faeces (lactobacillus casei and  lactobacillus fermentum) and pig faeces (lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus animalis, lactobacillus murinus, and lactobacillus vaginalis). pediococcus acidilactici strains were isolated from iberian dry fermented sausages and pig faeces, whereas the greatest number of enterococcus strains were identified as enterococcus faecium, with this species being isolated from iberian dry fermented sausages, and human and pig faeces. most of these strains are promising probiotic meat culture candidates suitable for iberian dry fermented sausages.

TI  == relationship between the in vitro response of dendritic cells to lactobacillus and prevention of tumorigenesis in the mouse.
AB  == background: some strains of lactobacilli stimulate immune cells, yet little is known about their potency in cancer prevention. we have previously reported that  lactobacillus casei shirota (lcs) suppresses murine tumorigenesis through immune  modulation. in this study, differences were compared among six representative strains of lactobacilli in regard to their ability to stimulate bone marrow cell-derived dendritic cells (bmdcs) in vitro and tumor suppression in vivo. methods: bm-dcs were cocultured with a lactobacillus strain in vitro, and the interleukin (il)-12 released into the culture supernatant was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. tumors were chemically induced by a single subcutaneous injection of 3-methylcholanthrene (mc) in balb/c mice. the test diets containing lactobacillus were given from the day of the mc injection, and the tumor incidences were monitored. peyer's patches were dissected from lactobacillus-fed mice, and the status of c-src, a regulator of dcs, in peyer's patch cells was examined by western blotting. results: in the coculture system, l. fermentum ferm p-13857 and lcs potently elicited il-12 production. lcs but not the other strains of lactobacilli showed tumor suppression. the inactive form of  c-src, phosphorylated at tyr527, was dominantly detected in peyer's patches resected from l. fermentum ferm p-13857-fed mice compared with lcs-fed mice. conclusions: the responses of dcs may be associated with tumor suppression by an  ingested lactobacillus strain.

TI  == effect of proton pump inhibitor pantoprazole on growth and morphology of oral lactobacillus strains.
AB  == objectives: proton pump inhibitors (ppi) used to suppress acid secretion in the stomach are among the most widely prescribed medications. there is emerging evidence of proton secretion elsewhere in the aerodigestive tract, and acidic microenvironments are integral to oral flora such as lactobacillus. the hypothesis of this study is that the growth rate and morphology of oral lactobacillus strains are effected by ppis. methods: nineteen different strains of lactobacilli were inoculated in microtiter plates at ph of 4.5 to 6.5 and exposed to twofold dilutions of pantoprazole at a range of 2.5 mg/ml to 2.5 microg/ml. bacterial growth was monitored, and the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of the drug was determined for the strains most sensitive to  pantoprazole. results: in the unexposed (control) group, nine lactobacilli strains were affected by ph changes from 6.5 to 4.5. in the group exposed to pantoprazole, 9 of the 19 lactobacilli strains were found to have an mic below 625 microg/ml, with l. plantarum 14917 being the most sensitive (mic = 20 microg/ml). in some strains, such as l. s. salivarius 11741, gram-staining revealed conformational changes in the bacteria when grown in the presence of pantoprazole. conclusion: growth rates and morphology of oral lactobacillus are affected by the ph of the environment. pantoprazole at supraphysiologic doses further affects growth rates and conformation in some strains. significance: the  balance of oral flora and upper digestive tract homeostasis may be affected by unexpected targets of ppi pharmacotherapy, with possible unanticipated consequences.

TI  == nonstarter lactobacillus strains as adjunct cultures for cheese making: in vitro  characterization and performance in two model cheeses.
AB  == nonstarter lactic acid bacteria are the main uncontrolled factor in today's industrial cheese making and may be the cause of quality inconsistencies and defects in cheeses. in this context, adjunct cultures of selected lactobacilli from nonstarter lactic acid bacteria origin appear as the best alternative to indirectly control cheese biota. the objective of the present work was to study the technological properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from cheese by in  vitro and in situ assays. milk acidification kinetics and proteolytic and acidifying activities were assessed, and peptide mapping of trichloroacetic acid  8% soluble fraction of milk cultures was performed by liquid chromatography. in addition, the tolerance to salts (nacl and kcl) and the phage-resistance were investigated. four strains were selected for testing as adjunct cultures in cheese making experiments at pilot plant scale. in in vitro assays, most strains  acidified milk slowly and showed weak to moderate proteolytic activity. fast strains decreased milk ph to 4.5 in 8 h, and continued acidification to 3.5 in 12 h or more. this group consisted mostly of lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus rhamnosus strains. approximately one-third of the slow strains, which comprised mainly lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus curvatus, were capable to grow when milk was supplemented with glucose and casein hydrolysate. peptide maps were similar to those of lactic acid bacteria considered to have a moderate proteolytic activity. most strains showed  salt tolerance and resistance to specific phages. the lactobacillus strains selected as adjunct cultures for cheese making experiments reached 10(8) cfu/g in soft cheeses at 7 d of ripening, whereas they reached 10(9) cfu/g in semihard cheeses after 15 d of ripening. in both cheese varieties, the adjunct culture population remained at high counts during all ripening, in some cases overcoming  or equaling primary starter. overall, proximate composition of cheeses with and without added lactobacilli did not differ; however, some of the tested strains continued acidifying during ripening, which was mainly noticed in soft cheeses and affected overall quality of the products. the lactobacilli strains with low acidifying activity showed appropriate technological characteristics for their use as adjunct cultures in soft and semihard cheeses.

AB  == nonstarter lactic acid bacteria isolated from argentinean cheeses were identified and characterized by focusing on their resistance to biological barriers, along with other physiological features of potential interest, in the search for future probiotic organisms. lactobacilli were enumerated and isolated from semihard and  soft cheeses made with multistrain streptococcus thermophilus starters. lactobacilli counts in 1-week-old cheeses were between 10(5) and 10(7) cfu/g and  then reached 10(7) cfu/ g in all 1-month samples, while streptococci were always  above 10(9) cfu/g. a total number of 22 lactobacilli isolates were retained, identified, and characterized by in vitro tests. species identity was determined  by carbohydrate metabolism and species-specific pcr assays. genetic diversity was explored by random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) pcr analysis. the lactobacillus strains were assigned to the species l. casei, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus, l. curvatus, l. fermentum, and l. perolens. all the strains studied tolerated 25 ppm of lysozyme, and most of them showed resistance to 0.3% bile. after incubation in gastric solution (ph 2.0), counts decreased by several log units, ranging from 3.2 to 7.0. the strains were able to grow in the presence of  bile salts, but only three isolates were capable of deconjugation. the nonstarter lactobacilli that were assayed fermented the prebiotic substrates (especially lactulose and inulin). some strains showed high cell hydrophobicity and beta-galactosidase activity, as well as inhibitory activity against pathogenic bacteria. it was concluded that most of the lactobacilli isolated in this study demonstrated resistance to biological barriers and physiological characteristics  compatible with probiotic properties, which make them suitable for further research in in vivo studies aimed at identifying new probiotic organisms.

AB  == aims: to isolate lactobacilli from the mucus layer of the human intestine and evaluate their adhesion abilities using a biacore assay. methods and results: thirty strains of lactobacilli were isolated from the mucus layer of normal human intestinal tissues using conventional plate culture. the strains were identified  using homology comparisons of the 16s rdna sequence to databases as lactobacillus salivarius (26%), lactobacillus fermentum (13%), lactobacillus gasseri (10%), lactobacillus paracasei (7%), lactobacillus casei (3%), lactobacillus mucosae (3%) and lactobacillus plantarum (3%). lactobacillus plantarum la 318 shows the highest adhesion to human colonic mucin (hcm) using the biacore assay at 115.30 +/- 12.37 resonance unit (ru). the adhesion of cell wall surface proteins from strain la 318 was significantly higher to hcm than to bovine serum albumin (bsa;  p < 0.05). conclusions: we isolated 30 strains of lactobacilli. lactobacillus salivarius was the predominant species of lactobacilli isolated in this study. the adhesion of strain la 318 isolated from human transverse colon to its mucin was shown. the adhesion could be mediated by lectin-like components on the bacterial cell surface. significance and impact of the study: this is the first study where lactobacilli were isolated from human intestinal tissues and shown to adhere to hcm.

TI  == calcium modulates interactions between bacteria and hydroxyapatite.
AB  == bacterial adhesion onto hydroxyapatite is known to depend on the surface properties of both the biomaterial and the bacterial strain, but less is known about the influence of the composition of the aqueous medium. here, the adhesion  of streptococcus mutans and 3 different lactobacilli on powdered hydroxyapatite was shown to change with ca2+ concentration. the effect depends on the surface properties of each strain. adhesion of lactobacillus fermentum and salivarius (and of streptococcus mutans at low ca2+) was enhanced with increasing ca2+ concentration. lactobacillus casei was efficiently removed by adhesion on hydroxyapatite, even without ca2+ addition, and the effect of this ion was only marginal. the results are interpreted in terms of ca2+-mediated adhesion, and relative to the hydrophobic properties of each strain and the electrical properties of the bacterial and solid surfaces (electrophoretic mobility).

TI  == expression of the immunity protein of plantaricin 423, produced by lactobacillus  plantarum 423, and analysis of the plasmid encoding the bacteriocin.
AB  == plantaricin 423 is a class iia bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus plantarum isolated from sorghum beer. it has been previously determined that plantaricin 423 is encoded by a plasmid designated ppla4, which is now completely sequenced.  the plantaricin 423 operon shares high sequence similarity with the operons of coagulin, pediocin pa-1, and pediocin ach, with small differences in the dna sequence encoding the mature bacteriocin peptide and the immunity protein. apart  from the bacteriocin operon, no significant sequence similarity could be detected between the dna or translated sequence of ppla4 and the available dna or translated sequences of the plasmids encoding pediocin ach, pediocin pa-1, and coagulin, possibly indicating a different origin. in addition to the bacteriocin  operon, sequence analysis of ppla4 revealed the presence of two open reading frames (orfs). orf1 encodes a putative mobilization (mob) protein that is homologous to the pmv158 superfamily of mobilization proteins. highest sequence similarity occurred between this protein and the mob protein of l. plantarum ncdo 1088. orf2 encodes a putative replication protein that revealed low sequence similarity to replication proteins of plasmids plme300 from lactobacillus fermentum and pyit356 from lactobacillus casei. the immunity protein of plantaricin 423 contains 109 amino acids. although plantaricin 423 shares high sequence similarity with the pediocin pa-1 operon, no cross-reactivity was recorded between the immunity proteins of plantaricin 423 and pediocin pa-1.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of non-enterococcal intrinsic glycopeptide-resistant gram-positive organisms.
AB  == non-enterococcal gram-positive bacteria that are intrinsically vancomycin-resistant have been infrequently isolated in association with serious  infections. however, well-documented infections have lately been reported with increasing frequency. because these organisms may be pathogens, we tested the mics of 19 antimicrobial agents by the agar dilution method for predicting susceptibility. the activity of these antimicrobial agents was assessed against 28 strains (lactobacillus rhamnosus, 6; lactobacillus acidophilus, 1; lactobacillus casei, 1; lactobacillus fermentum, 2; lactobacillus brevis, 1; lactobacillus plantarum, 1; weissella confusa, 2; leuconostoc mesenteroides, 7; leuconostoc lactis, 4; pediococcus acidilactici, 2; pediococcus pentosaceus, 1),  isolated from clinical specimens in an argentinian university hospital from 1997  to 2003. the mics of penicillin for 67% of the lactobacillus strains and 100% of  the leuconostoc spp. and pediococcus spp. strains tested were in the 0.25-2 microg/ml range. erythromycin was the most active antimicrobial overall. multiresistance was observed in 2 strains (lactobacillus rhamnosus, 1; lactobacillus plantarum, 1).

TI  == induction of interleukin-12 by lactobacillus strains having a rigid cell wall resistant to intracellular digestion.
AB  == some strains of lactobacilli can stimulate macrophages and dendritic cells to secrete il-12, which plays a key role in activating innate immunity. we examined  the il-12-inducing ability of 47 lactobacillus strains belonging to 10 species in mouse peritoneal macrophages, and characterized the properties important for the  induction of il-12. although considerable differences in il-12-inducing ability were observed among the strains tested, almost all strains belonging to the lactobacillus casei group (l. casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus zeae) or to lactobacillus fermentum induced high levels of il-12. phagocytosis of lactobacilli was necessary for il-12 induction, and the strains with strong il-12 induction were relatively resistant to lysis in the macrophages. the sensitivity  of lactobacillus strains to in vitro treatment with m-1 enzyme, a member of the n-acetylmuramidases, was negatively correlated with il-12-inducing ability. using a probiotic strain, l. casei strain shirota (lcs), we showed that the cell wall of lcs could be digested by long-term treatment with a high dose of m-1 enzyme and that the il-12-inducing ability was diminished according to the duration of the enzyme treatment. the soluble polysaccharide-peptidoglycan complex released from the cell wall of lcs did not induce il-12, whereas the insoluble intact cell wall of lcs induced il-12. these results suggest that the intact cell wall structure of lactobacilli is an important element in the ability to induce il-12  and that lactobacillus strains having a rigid cell wall resistant to intracellular digestion effectively stimulate macrophages to induce il-12.

TI  == culture-independent analysis of the microbial composition of the african traditional fermented foods poto poto and degue by using three different dna extraction methods.
AB  == the microbial composition of the traditional fermented foods poto poto (a maize dough from the rep. of congo) and degue (a millet dough from burkina faso) was studied by a culture-independent approach using ttge to separate the amplified target v3 region of the 16s rrna gene from total microbial community, followed by dna sequencing and homology search. three different extraction methods were used. guanidium thiocyanate-based dna extraction provided better performance regarding  purity and dna yield, allowing the detection of a higher number of dna bands by ttge in poto poto. by contrast, all three methods yielded similar results for degue samples, indicating that the performance of the dna extraction method largely depends on the food composition. sequencing of dna bands from ttge gels corresponding to poto poto samples revealed the presence of lactobacillus gasseri, enterococcus sp., escherichia coli, lactobacillus plantarum/paraplantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, bacillus sp., lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus casei. the following bacteria were identified in degue: l. gasseri, enterococcus sp., e. coli, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, and l. casei.

TI  == probiotics for prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections in women: a review of the evidence from microbiological and clinical studies.
AB  == recurrent urinary tract infections (utis) afflict a great number of women around  the world. the use of probiotics, especially lactobacilli, has been considered for the prevention of utis. since lactobacilli dominate the urogenital flora of healthy premenopausal women, it has been suggested that restoration of the urogenital flora, which is dominated by uropathogens, with lactobacilli may protect against utis. this review is based on a search of pubmed for relevant articles. many in vitro studies, animal experiments, microbiological studies in healthy women, and clinical trials in women with utis have been carried out to assess the effectiveness and safety of probiotics for prophylaxis against uropathogens. most of them had encouraging findings for some specific strains of  lactobacilli. lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and l. reuteri rc-14 (previously called l. fermentum rc-14) seemed to be the most effective among the studied lactobacilli for the prevention of utis. l. casei shirota and l. crispatus ctv-05 have also shown efficacy in some studies. l. rhamnosus gg did not appear to be quite as effective in the prevention of utis. the evidence from the available studies suggests that probiotics can be beneficial for preventing recurrent utis  in women; they also have a good safety profile. however, further research is needed to confirm these results before the widespread use of probiotics for this  indication can be recommended.

TI  == characterisation of prototype nurmi cultures using culture-based microbiological  techniques and pcr-dgge.
AB  == undefined nurmi-type cultures (ntcs) have been used successfully to prevent salmonella colonisation in poultry for decades. such cultures are derived from the caecal contents of specific-pathogen-free birds and are administered via drinking water or spray application onto eggs in the hatchery. these cultures consist of many non-culturable and obligately anaerobic bacteria. due to their undefined nature it is difficult to obtain approval from regulatory agencies to use these preparations as direct fed microbials for poultry. in this study, 10 batches of prototype ntcs were produced using an identical protocol over a period of 2 years. traditional microbiological techniques and a molecular culture-independent methodology, polymerase chain reaction combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge), were applied to characterise  these cultures and also to examine if the constituents of the ntcs were identical. culture-dependent analysis of these cultures included plating on a variety of selective and semi-selective agars, examination of colony morphology,  gram-staining and a series of biochemical tests (api, biomerieux, france). two sets of pcr-dgge studies were performed. these involved the amplification of universal and subsequently lactic acid bacteria (lab)-specific hypervariable regions of a 16s rrna gene by pcr. resultant amplicons were subjected to dgge. sequence analysis was performed on subsequent bands present in resultant dgge profiles using the basic local alignment search tool (blast). microbiological culturing techniques tended to isolate common probiotic bacterial species from the genera lactobacillus, lactococcus, bifidobacterium, enterococcus, clostridium, escherichia, pediococcus and enterobacterium as well as members of the genera, actinomyces, bacteroides, propionibacterium, capnocytophaga, proteus, and klebsiella. bacteroides, enterococcus, escherichia, brevibacterium, klebsiella, lactobacillus, clostridium, bacillus, eubacterium, serratia, citrobacter, enterobacter, pectobacterium and pantoea spp. in addition to unculturable bacteria were identified as constituents of the ntcs using universal pcr-dgge analysis. a number of the sequences detected by lab-specific pcr-dgge were homologous to those of a number of lactobacillus spp., including l. fermentum, l. pontis, l. crispatus, l. salivarius, l. casei, l. suntoryeus, l. vaginalis, l. gasseri, l. aviaries, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, and l. mucosae  in addition to a range of unculturable lactobacilli. while ntcs are successful due to their complexity, the presence of members of lactobacillus spp. amongst other probiotic genera, in these samples possibly lends to the success of the ntc cultures as probiotics or competitive exclusion products in poultry over the decades. pcr-dgge proved to be an effective tool in detecting non-culturable organisms present in these complex undefined cultures. in conclusion, while the culture-dependent identification methods or pcr-dgge alone cannot comprehensively elucidate the bacterial species present in such complex cultures, their complementarity provides useful information on the identity of the constituents of ntcs and will aid in future development of defined probiotics. moreover, for the purpose of analysing prototype ntcs during their development, pcr-dgge overcomes the limitations associated with conventional culturing methods including their low sensitivities, inability to detect unculturable bacteria and  unknown species, very slow turnabout time and poor reproducibility. this study demonstrated that pcr-dgge is indeed more valuable in detecting predominant microbial populations between various ntcs than as an identification methodology, being more applicable as a quality control method used to analyse for batch-to-batch variation during ntc production.

TI  == quantitative real-time pcr analysis of fecal lactobacillus species in infants receiving a prebiotic infant formula.
AB  == the developing intestinal microbiota of breast-fed infants is considered to play  an important role in the priming of the infants' mucosal and systemic immunity. generally, bifidobacterium and lactobacillus predominate the microbiota of breast-fed infants. in intervention trials it has been shown that lactobacilli can exert beneficial effects on, for example, diarrhea and atopy. however, the lactobacillus species distribution in breast-fed or formula-fed infants has not yet been determined in great detail. for accurate enumeration of different lactobacilli, duplex 5' nuclease assays, targeted on rrna intergenic spacer regions, were developed for lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the  designed and validated assays were used to determine the amounts of different lactobacillus species in fecal samples of infants receiving a standard formula (sf) or a standard formula supplemented with galacto- and fructo-oligosaccharides in a 9:1 ratio (osf). a breast-fed group (bf) was studied in parallel as a reference. during the 6-week intervention period a significant increase was shown in total percentage of fecal lactobacilli in the bf group (0.8% +/- 0.3% versus 4.1% +/- 1.5%) and the osf group (0.8% +/- 0.3% versus 4.4% +/- 1.4%). the lactobacillus species distribution in the osf group was comparable to breast-fed  infants, with relatively high levels of l. acidophilus, l. paracasei, and l. casei. the sf-fed infants, on the other hand, contained more l. delbrueckii and less l. paracasei compared to breast-fed infants and osf-fed infants. an infant milk formula containing a specific mixture of prebiotics is able to induce a microbiota that closely resembles the microbiota of bf infants.

TI  == use of polymerase chain reaction techniques and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for differentiation of oral lactobacillus species.
AB  == background/aims: the genus lactobacillus has been associated with dental caries in humans, although it is seldom speciated due to lack of simple and nonlaborious identification methods. a considerable heterogeneity among lactobacillus species  has been demonstrated. the purpose of this study was to develop simple methods combining restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-amplified 16s rrna (16s rrna gene pcr-rflp) and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) for the identification of 13 reference strains of lactobacillus. methods: the 16s rrna gene sequences were  amplified by pcr using universal primers and digestion of pcr products with the restriction endonucleases, hpaii and haeiii. the 16s rrna gene pcr-rflp is reproducible and has been proved to be useful for differentiating lactobacillus strains to species level. seventy-seven lactobacillus isolates from a thai population were used to show the applicability of the identification test. results: pcr-rflp alone had limitations, because the rflp patterns of lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus rhamnosus and of lactobacillus acidophilus  and lactobacillus crispatus showed similar patterns; however, these could be differentiated by sds-page. of the 77 isolates, 38 were identified as lactobacillus fermentum, 25 as l. rhamnosus, 5 as lactobacillus salivarius, 5 as  l. casei, 3 as l. acidophilus and 1 as lactobacillus plantarum. conclusion: 16s rrna gene pcr-rflp, using hpaii and haeiii, together with sds-page protein profiles could be an alternative method for the identification of oral lactobacillus strains to species level, and may be applicable for large-scale studies on the association of lactobacillus to dental caries.

TI  == lactobacillus bacteremia, species identification, and antimicrobial susceptibility of 85 blood isolates.
AB  == background: data regarding antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical lactobacillus isolates are scarce, and appropriate interpretation criteria for susceptibility tests are not available. methods: we examined 85 cases of lactobacillus bacteremia, of which 47 cases have been included in our previous studies. overall, 14 antimicrobial agents were evaluated by the e-test method, and these results were compared with disk diffusion test findings. the clinical outcomes of the patients and their antimicrobial treatments were registered. results: the antimicrobial susceptibility of lactobacillus strains was species dependent. the  considerable number of lactobacillus rhamnosus (n=46), lactobacillus fermentum (n=12), and lactobacillus casei (n=12) strains available for testing made it possible to compare the susceptibilities within 1 species, as well. of the 46 l.  rhamnosus isolates, 22 were identified as l. rhamnosus gg type by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. all lactobacillus isolates demonstrated low minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, erythromycin, and clindamycin. mics of vancomycin were high (>256 microg/ml) for  all other species except lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus jensenii. disk diffusion and e-test results were concordant. the mics of cephalosporins varied;  cefuroxime demonstrated a higher level of activity than did ceftriaxone. benzylpenicillin and ampicillin mics had variable ranges between different species. combination therapy was given to 83% of the patients, but, in 54% of them, therapy included only 1 microbiologically active agent, according to results of the susceptibility tests. mortality at 1 week was 12% among patients who presumably were receiving adequate treatment and 27% among patients who were  receiving inadequate treatment (p=.131, by e-test). conclusion: most clinical lactobacillus blood isolates demonstrated low mics of imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, erythromycin, and clindamycin, but they had variable susceptibility to penicillin and cephalosporins.

TI  == lactobacillus species isolated from the vagina: identification, hydrogen peroxide production and nonoxynol-9 resistance.
AB  == background: lactic acid production is considered to be the major protection mechanism of lactobacilli against vaginal infections due to genital pathogens. some species of lactobacillus are also hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)) producers. nonoxynol-9 (n-9) is a nonionic detergent and is the active component of many spermicidal preparations. it immobilizes sperm by disrupting the cell membrane and is believed to act similarly on a number of bacteria and viruses. it is known that n-9 inhibits lactobacilli in vitro at concentrations of 0.1% to 1%. purpose: the present study was conducted to identify the species of lactobacillus isolated from vaginal fluids of reproductive-age women and to characterize the h(2)o(2)-producing and n-9-resistant strains in an argentine population. results: we identified lactobacillus acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. gasseri, l. jensenii, l. casei subsp. casei, l. brevis and l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii as the most frequent species. in this argentine, south american population, 62% of women had h(2)o(2)-producing vaginal lactobacilli. we found a high number of sensitive  strains. sixty-two h(2)o(2)-producer strains were detected, 50 (80.6%) strains were sensitive to n-9 and 12 (19.4%) strains were resistant to the inhibitory effect of n-9. discussion: the vaginal microecologic findings are comparable to those found in other populations and suggest that (1) vaginal microecologic conditions are likely to be similar among argentine women as in other countries,  and (2) n-9 may have deleterious effects as in other populations.

TI  == oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health: species composition and antimicrobial activity.
AB  == background/aims: lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. however, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. we aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative  oral pathogens. methods: a total of 238 lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. in all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia was assessed. results: lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. the most prevalent strains in healthy persons were lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, lactobacillus plantarum. obligately homofermentatives, particularly l. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for l. gasseri, p < 0.01). sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited s. mutans, 88% a. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% p. gingivalis and 65% p. intermedia. the strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with lactobacillus paracasei, l. plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus salivarius. the strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against s. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. conclusion: the composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly l. gasseri, in the latter group. both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.

TI  == effects of yeasts and bacteria on the levels of folates in rye sourdoughs.
AB  == fermentation of rye dough is often accompanied with an increase in folate content. in this study, three sourdough yeasts, candida milleri cbs 8195, saccharomyces cerevisiae ts 146, and torulaspora delbrueckii ts 207; a control, baker's yeast s. cerevisiae alko 743; and four lactobacillus spp., l. acidophilus tsb 262, l. brevis tsb 307, l. plantarum tsb 304, and l. sanfranciscensis tsb 299 originally isolated from rye sourdough were examined for their abilities to produce or consume folates. the microorganisms were grown in yeast extract-peptone-d-glucose medium as well as in small-scale fermentations that modelled the sourdough fermentation step used in rye baking. total folate contents were determined using lactobacillus rhamnosus (atcc 7469) as the growth  indicator organism. the microorganisms studied did not excrete folates into the media in significant amounts. yeasts increased the folate contents of sterilised  rye flour-water mixtures from 6.5 microg/100 g to between 15 and 23 microg/100 g  after 19-h fermentation, whereas lactic acid bacteria decreased it to between 2.9 and 4.2 microg/100 g. strains of lactobacillus bulgaricus, l. casei, l. curvatus, l. fermentum, l. helveticus, pediococcus spp., and streptococcus thermophilus that were also tested gave folate contents after fermentation that varied between 2 and 10.4 microg/100 g. although the four lactobacillus spp. from sourdough consumed folates their effect on folate contents in co-cultivations was minimal.  it was concluded that the increase of folate content during fermentation was mainly due to folate synthesis by yeasts. fermentation of non-sterilised flour-water mixtures as such resulted in three-fold increases in the folate contents. two folate producing bacteria were isolated from the non-sterilised flour and identified as enterobacter cowanii and pantoea agglomerans.

TI  == rapid identification of dairy lactic acid bacteria by m13-generated, rapd-pcr fingerprint databases.
AB  == about a thousand lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific pcr and rapd-pcr, respectively. rapd-pcr profiles, which were obtained by using the m13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by bionumerics software. cluster analysis of the combined rapd-pcr fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library,  which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. a library unit, in this case, can be considered  to be a definable taxon. the strains belonged to 11 main rapd-pcr fingerprinting  library units identified as lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus lactis. the possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. the proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful lab strain collection. the same approach could also be applied to identify lab strains isolated from other food ecosystems.

AB  == aims: five different sourdoughs were investigated for the composition of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and the biodiversity of lactobacillus sanfranciscensis strains. methods and results: a total of 57 strains were isolated from five sourdoughs. isolated strains were all identified by the 16s rdna sequence and species-specific primers for l. sanfranciscensis. results of identification showed that lab strains were l. sanfranciscensis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paralimentarius, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus pontis, lactobacillus casei, weisella confusa and pediococcus pentosaceus. a total of 21  strains were identified as l. sanfranciscensis and these isolates were detected in all five sourdoughs. ribotyping was applied to investigate the relationship between intraspecies diversity of l. sanfranciscensis and sourdough. a total of 22 strains of l. sanfranciscensis including l. sanfranciscensis jcm 5668t were compared by ribotyping. the dendrogram of 21 ribotyping patterns showed four clusters, and l. sanfranciscensis jcm 5668t was independent of the others. the different biotypes of l. sanfranciscensis were present in two sourdoughs compared with other three sourdoughs. conclusions: the lab compositions of five sourdoughs were different and the relationship between intraspecies diversity of l. sanfranciscensis strains and five sourdoughs was shown by ribotyping. significance and impact of the study: this study demonstrated that ribotyping was useful for distinguishing l. sanfranciscensis strains. a further important result is that the intra-species diversity of l. sanfranciscensis strains seems to be related to the sourdough preparation.

TI  == quantitative analysis of diverse lactobacillus species present in advanced dental caries.
AB  == our previous analysis of 65 advanced dental caries lesions by traditional culture techniques indicated that lactobacilli were numerous in the advancing front of the progressive lesion. production of organic acids by lactobacilli is considered to be important in causing decalcification of the dentinal matrix. the present study was undertaken to define more precisely the diversity of lactobacilli found in this environment and to quantify the major species and phylotypes relative to  total load of lactobacilli by real-time pcr. pooled dna was amplified by pcr with lactobacillus genus-specific primers for subsequent cloning, sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. based on 16s ribosomal dna sequence comparisons, 18 different phylotypes of lactobacilli were detected, including strong representation of both novel and gastrointestinal phylotypes. specific pcr primers were designed for nine prominent species, including lactobacillus gasseri, l. ultunensis, l. salivarius, l. rhamnosus, l. casei, l. crispatus, l. delbrueckii, l. fermentum, and l. gallinarum. more than three different species were identified as being present in most of the dentine samples, confirming the widespread distribution and numerical importance of various lactobacillus spp. in carious dentine. quantification by real-time pcr revealed various proportions of  the nine species colonizing carious dentine, with higher mean loads of l. gasseri and l. ultunensis than of the other prevalent species. the findings provide a basis for further characterization of the pathogenicity of lactobacillus spp. in  the context of extension of the carious lesion.

TI  == relationship between interaction sites in the gut, hydrophobicity, mucosal immunomodulating capacities and cell wall protein profiles in indigenous and exogenous bacteria.
AB  == aims: to investigate whether there is a relationship between interaction sites in the gut, hydrophobicity, mucosal immunomodulating capacities and cell wall protein profiles in lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and enterococci. methods and results: hydrophobicity, cell wall protein profiles and sites of interaction in the gut (by using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled bacteria) were determined for lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, b. animalis and enterococcus faecalis. we also determined the number of immunoglobulin (ig)a+, tumour necrosis factor (tnf)alpha+, interleukin (il)-6+ and il-10+ cells after oral administration of the above bacteria to balb/c mice.  all strains assessed were found to interact with the sites of induction of the immune response in the gut. no correlation with hydrophobicity was observed. when some strains at certain doses were administered to mice, bacterial translocation  to liver was observed. the oral administration of indigenous (104 cells day(-1))  and exogenous (107 cells day(-1)) bifidobacteria and lactobacilli for 5 consecutive days activated the systemic and intestinal mucosal immune response in a strain-specific way, independently whether the strain was indigenous or exogenous in relation to the host. the differences in the immunopotentiating capacity of the various strains might be related to the differences in their cell wall protein profiles. conclusions: indigenous bacteria activated the mucosal immune response at a dose significantly smaller than the one required for probiotic exogenous bacteria. however, probiotic exogenous bacteria can be used at high concentrations in fermented dairy products with a great impact on the immune system, favouring its immunomodulation. significance and impact of the study: the immunomodulation capacity of probiotic bacteria is strain specific and independent of the specificity of the host. the ability of certain strains to down-regulate the production and release of il-6 by il-10 may have potential implications in their use in cases in which cytokine deregulation or excessive production at the mucosal level can be the cause of tissue damage.

TI  == role of peptidoglycan subtypes in the pathogenesis of bacterial cell wall arthritis.
AB  == background: bacterial cell wall (cw) arthritis develops in susceptible strains of rats after a single intraperitoneal injection of the cw from certain bacterial species, both pathogenic and non-pathogenic. for the development of chronic bacterial cw arthritis, the structure of the bacterial peptidoglycan (pg) has been found to be decisive. objective: to define the role of pg subtypes in the pathogenesis of chronic bacterial cw arthritis. method: arthritis was induced with cws of lactobacillus plantarum, l casei b, l casei c, and l fermentum. gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to measure the presence of cw derived muramic acid in the liver and to determine pg subtypes. cws were also tested for  their resistance to lysozyme in vitro. results: these results and those published previously indicate that pgs of cws which induce chronic arthritis, no matter whether they were derived from strains of streptococcus, bifidobacterium, collinsella, or lactobacillus, all have lysine as the third amino acid of the pg  stem peptide, representing pg subtypes a3alpha and a4alpha. those strains which induce only transient acute arthritis or no arthritis at all do not have lysine in this position, resulting in different pg subtypes. conclusions: in vivo degradation of only those pgs with the subtypes a3alpha and a4alpha leads to the  occurrence of large cw fragments, which persist in tissue and have good proinflammatory ability. cws with other pg subtypes, even if they are lysozyme resistant, do not cause chronic arthritis, because the released fragments are not phlogistic. it is emphasised that a variety of microbial components not causing inflammation have been found in animal and human synovial tissue.

TI  == probiotics and the urologist.
AB  == emerging from the stigma of once being referred to as "snake oil", excellent scientific and clinical evidence now exists to indicate that probiotics do indeed have a role to play in medicine. the proper definition of probiotics is important "live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health  benefit on the host", for several reasons. it rules out so-called probiotics that have no clinically proven, peer-reviewed data, and it states the need to have viable bacteria present, unlike these pseudo products which are often wrongly labeled, poorly manufactured, with low or no viability at time of use. guidelines, prepared by the united nations and world health organization are now  available to guide physicians and consumers as to the types of strains with documented benefits. in urology, the most studied strains are lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and l. fermentum b-54 and rc-14. their use daily in oral form, or  once to three times weekly as a vaginal suppository, have been shown to reduce the urogenital pathogen load and the risk of urinary tract and vaginal infections. organisms such as oxalobacter formigenes, still in the r&d phase, offer great potential to reduce kidney stone formation via oxalate degradation in the intestine. some studies using l. casei shirota suggest a possible effect against bladder cancer, while studies using l. plantarum 299 show significantly reduced infection rates in patients undergoing major surgical procedures. in short, specific probiotic strains hold much promise for use in the urology setting.

TI  == lectin-like binding of lactobacilli considered for their use in probiotical preparations for animal use.
AB  == three gut lactobacilli from piglets (lactobacillus plantarum l 5, lactobacillus paracasei l 81, lactobacillus fermentum l 670) and lactobacillus casei subsp. pseudoplantarum l.c.) from a calf were examined by microtitre plate binding assay for their lectin-like binding activity after their cultivation on rogosa agar and in mrs broth. three ecm (extracellular matrix) molecules (fetuin, porcine fibronectin and porcine mucin) were selected for this assay. additionally, the effect of heparin on the binding of these three ecm molecules by lactobacillus strains in microtitre plates was tested. moreover, haemagglutination tests with pig, cattle, sheep, and hen erythrocytes were performed. however, none of the four lactobacillus strains examined did react with any of the erythrocytes tested. the differences between individual strains were observed in their binding to immobilised ecm molecules. the best adherent was the lactobacillus plantarum l5, however, the other three strains showed also good ecm binding. with regard to an influence of cultivation medium on lectin-like binding activity, binding of all ecm molecules was expressed in lactobacillus paracasei l 81 to significantly  higher degree (p < 0.001) after cultivation on rogosa agar than in mrs broth. similarly, strains lactobacillus fermentum l 670 and lactobacillus casei subsp. pseudoplantarum l.c. displayed significantly higher (p < 0.001) binding of fibronectin and mucin after growth on rogosa agar in comparison with mrs broth cultivation. however, no significant (on fetuin and fibronectin binding) or opposite effect (on mucin binding) of cultivation medium was observed in lactobacillus plantarum l 5 strain. the influence of cultivation medium on fetuin binding by lactobacillus fermentum l 670 was also not significant while lactobacillus casei subsp. pseudoplantarum l.c. bound fetuin significantly better (p < 0.01) after growth on rogosa agar. heparin pretreatment increased the binding of the ecm molecules by the lactobacillus fermentum l 670 strain significantly (p < 0.001 or p < 0.05) with the exception of porcine fibronectin when the strain was cultivated in mrs broth. this result is important especially  in the connection with the previous observations that heparin decreased ecm binding of enteropathogens as staphylococci or clinical enterococcal isolates. following up on some earlier strain characteristics, these results indicate that  the selected lactobacilli are probably suitable for probiotic purposes.

TI  == lipoteichoic acids from lactobacillus strains elicit strong tumor necrosis factor alpha-inducing activities in macrophages through toll-like receptor 2.
AB  == lactobacilli are nonpathogenic gram-positive inhabitants of microflora. at least  some lactobacillus strains have been postulated to have health beneficial effects, such as the stimulation of the immune system. here we examined the stimulatory effects of lactobacilli on mouse immune cells. all six heat-killed lactobacillus strains examined induced the secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) from mouse splenic mononuclear cells, albeit to various degrees. when fractionated subcellular fractions of lactobacillus casei were tested for nf-kappab activation and tnf-alpha production in raw264.7, a mouse macrophage cell line, the activity was found to be as follows: protoplast > cell  wall >> polysaccharide-peptidoglycan complex. both crude extracts and purified lipoteichoic acids (ltas) from two lactobacillus strains, l. casei and l. fermentum, significantly induced tnf-alpha secretion from raw264.7 cells and splenocytes of c57bl/6, c3h/hen, and c3h/hej mice but not from splenocytes of c57bl/6 tlr2(-/-) mice. lactobacillus lta induced activation of c-jun n-terminal  kinase activation in raw264.7 cells. furthermore, in hek293t cells transected with a combination of cd14 and toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2), nf-kappab was activated in response to lactobacillus lta. taken together, these data suggest that ltas from lactobacilli elicit proinflammatory activities through tlr2.

TI  == mononuclear cell response to enterobacteria and gram-positive cell walls of normal intestinal microbiota in early rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory arthritides.
AB  == objective: to study whether enterobacteria and gram-positive bacterial cell walls (bcw) derivedfrom normal intestinal microbiota are involved in the etiopathogenesis of early rheumatoid arthritis (ra). methods: peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) and synovial fluid mononuclear cells (sfmc) were isolatedfrom patients with early ra (the average duration of 5 months) and the controls (other types of inflammatory arthritis). the mononuclear cell proliferation and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) responses to heat-killed salmonella enteritidis (se). yersinia enterocolitica (ye), and escherichia coli (ec), and to gram-positive bcw derived from four common intestinal indigenous bacteria, eubacterium aerofaciens (ea), eubacterium limosum (el), lactobacillus casei (lc), and lactobacillus fermentum (lf), and a bcw derived from a pathogen, streptococcus pyogenes (sp) were investigated. results:  39% or 56% of patients with early ra showed significant proliferation responses by pbmc or sfmc against enterobacteria, respectively. in other types of arthritis, corresponding figures were 59% or 66%. when bcw were used as antigens, 8.1% or 23% of patients with early ra showed proliferation responses by pbmc or sfmc, respectively. in other types of arthritis the corresponding figures were 7.5% or 35%, respectively. however, tnf-alpha production by sfmc stimulated by ea bcw, se, ye or ec, was significantly higher in early ra than in other types of arthritis. conclusion: these results suggest that sfmc reacting with enterobacteria or bcw exist in some patients with early ra, but also in other types of inflammatory arthritis. intestinal bacterial agents may play a role in the etiopathogenesis of ra, but the effect appears to be non-specific.

TI  == the predominant microflora of nursing caries lesions.
AB  == the predominant microflora recovered from infected dentine of 52 carious teeth from 14 children with nursing caries was determined using both selective and non-selective media for the isolation of specific genera and acidified media (ph  5.2) to isolate the predominant aciduric microorganisms, and compared with the microflora of sound enamel surfaces in caries-free children. streptococcus mutans formed a significantly greater proportion of the lesion flora while streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus gordonii formed a significantly greater proportion of the plaque flora from sound tooth surfaces. the proportions of actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces odontolyticus were significantly greater in the plaque samples than in the lesion samples. actinomyces israelii formed 18.2% of the flora from the lesions, but was not isolated from the plaque  samples. the proportions of candida albicans, lactobacillus spp. and veillonella  spp. were also significantly greater in the carious dentine than in the plaque samples. the most frequently isolated lactobacilli were lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the predominant aciduric flora was s. oralis, s. mutans and a. israelii and these taxa were also isolated  from a similar proportion of the lesions at ph 7.0. strains of s. mutans, l. casei, l. fermentum and l. rhamnosus isolated from individual carious teeth were  genotyped using pcr-based methods. each species was genotypically heterogeneous and different genotypes were recovered from different carious teeth in the same child. these data indicate that the microflora of lesions in the same child is microbiologically diverse and support a non-specific aetiology for nursing caries in which the physiological characteristics of the infecting flora, not its composition, is the major determinant underlying the disease process.

TI  == evolution of the lactic acid bacterial community during malt whisky fermentation: a polyphasic study.
AB  == the development of the lactic acid bacterial community in a commercial malt whisky fermentation occurred in three broad phases. initially, bacteria were inhibited by strong yeast growth. fluorescence microscopy and environmental scanning electron microscopy revealed, in this early stage, both cocci and rods that were at least partly derived from the wort and yeast but also stemmed from the distillery plant. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of partial 16s rrna genes and sequence analysis revealed cocci related to streptococcus thermophilus or saccharococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus brevis, and lactobacillus fermentum. the middle phase began 35 to 40 h after yeast inoculation and was characterized by exponential growth of lactobacilli and residual yeast metabolism. lactobacillus casei or lactobacillus paracasei, l. fermentum, and lactobacillus ferintoshensis were detected in samples of fermenting wort examined by dgge during this stage. bacterial growth was accompanied by the accumulation of acetic and lactic acids and the metabolism of  residual maltooligosaccharides. by 70 h, two new pcr bands were detected on dgge  gels, and the associated bacteria were largely responsible for the final phase of the fermentation. the bacteria were phylogenetically related to lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii, and strains similar to the former had  previously been recovered from malt whisky fermentations in japan. these were probably obligately homofermentative bacteria, required malt wort for growth, and could not be cultured on normal laboratory media, such as mrs. their metabolism during the last 20 to 30 h of fermentation was associated with yeast death and autolysis and further accumulation of lactate but no additional acetate.

TI  == quality control lactobacillus strains for use with the api 50ch and api zym systems at 37 degrees c.
AB  == the api 50ch and api zym systems fulfil an important role in the polyphasic taxonomic identification of lactobacilli. when the api 50ch fermentation profile  of the quality control lactobacillus casei var. alactosus (lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei) strain ncfb 206 was determined at 37 degrees c, it was found to differ from that determined at 30 degrees c by biomereiux sa (montalieu vercieu, france) and the national collection of food bacteria (aberdeen, scotland). in addition, the api 50ch fermentation and api zym profiles of lb. casei strain atcc 334t determined at 37 degrees c differed from those determined at 30 degrees c by lee  and simard (1984). strains ncfb 206 and atcc 334t were thus assumed to exhibit temperature-dependent variation in fermentation profile, a phenomenon recently described by nigatu et al. (2000). in contrast, lb. rhamnosus strain atcc 243t did not exhibit temperature-dependent variation in fermentation profile. moreover, the fermentation profile obtained at 37 degrees c differed in only one  respect (positive beta-gentiobiose utilisation) from that published by collins et al. (1989). in addition, lactobacillus strain gg produced a stable and reproducible api zym profile at 37 degrees c, although some variation in the level of enzyme activity was evident. thus, strain ncfb 206 was replaced by strain atcc 243t as the quality control strain of choice for use with the api 50ch fermentation system, and lactobacillus strain gg adopted for use as a quality control strain with the api zym system for strain identification of lactobacilli at 37 degrees c. the api 50ch and api zym profiles of the commercially important lactobacillus strains ncfb 1748, gg, kld, f19, and aca-dc  212.3 were determined at 37 degrees c after anaerobic growth in mrs broth. the fermentation and enzyme profiles of strain ncfb 1748 were almost identical to those of lb. crispatus atcc 33820t, those of strain gg were found to be more similar to those of lb. rhamnosus strain 243t than lb. zeae strain atcc 15820t, those of strain kld were most similar to those of lb. fermentum dsm 20052t, while those of strains f19 and aca-dc 212.3 were similar to those of lb. casei strain atcc 334t.

AB  == the antimicrobial activity of the intraurethrally administered probiotic lactobacillus casei strain shirota against escherichia coli in a murine urinary tract infection (uti) model was examined. uti was induced by intraurethral administration of escherichia coli strain hu-1 (a clinical isolate from a uti patient, positive for type 1 and p fimbriae), at a dose of 1 x 10(6) to 2 x 10(6) cfu in 20 microl of saline, into a c3h/hen mouse bladder which had been traumatized with 0.1 n hcl followed immediately by neutralization with 0.1 n naoh 24 h before the challenge infection. chronic infection with the pathogen at 10(6) cfu in the urinary tract (bladder and kidneys) was maintained for more than 3 weeks after the challenge, and the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and myeloperoxidase activity in the urine were markedly elevated during the infection period. a single administration of l. casei shirota at a dose of 10(8) cfu 24 h before the challenge infection dramatically inhibited e. coli growth and inflammatory responses in the urinary tract. multiple daily treatments with l. casei shirota during the postinfection period also showed antimicrobial activity  in this uti model. a heat-killed preparation of l. casei shirota exerted significant antimicrobial effects not only with a single pretreatment (100 microg/mouse) but also with multiple daily treatments during the postinfection period. the other lactobacillus strains tested, i.e., l. fermentum atcc 14931(t), l. jensenii atcc 25258(t), l. plantarum atcc 14917(t), and l. reuteri jcm 1112(t), had no significant antimicrobial activity. taken together, these results suggest that the probiotic l. casei strain shirota is a potent therapeutic agent  for uti.

AB  == non-starter lactic acid bacteria (nslab) were isolated from 12 italian ewe cheeses representing six different types of cheese, which in several cases were produced by different manufacturers. a total of 400 presumptive lactobacillus isolates were obtained, and 123 isolates and 10 type strains were subjected to phenotypic, genetic, and cell wall protein characterization analyses. phenotypically, the cheese isolates included 32% lactobacillus plantarum isolates, 15% l. brevis isolates, 12% l. paracasei subsp. paracasei isolates, 9%  l. curvatus isolates, 6% l. fermentum isolates, 6% l. casei subsp. casei isolates, 5% l. pentosus isolates, 3% l. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum isolates, and 1% l. rhamnosus isolates. eleven percent of the isolates were not phenotypically identified. although a randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) analysis based on three primers and clustering by the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic average (upgma) was useful for partially differentiating the 10 type strains, it did not provide a species-specific dna band or a combination of bands which permitted complete separation of all the species considered. in contrast, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis cell wall protein profiles clustered by upgma were species specific and resolved the nslab. the only exceptions were isolates phenotypically identified as l. plantarum and l. pentosus or as l. casei subsp. casei and l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, which were grouped together. based on protein profiles, italian ewe cheeses frequently contained four different species and 3 to 16 strains. in general, the cheeses produced from raw ewe milk contained a larger number of more diverse strains than the cheeses produced from pasteurized  milk. the same cheese produced in different factories contained different species, as well as strains that belonged to the same species but grouped in different rapd clusters.

TI  == inhibition of uropathogenic biofilm growth on silicone rubber in human urine by lactobacilli--a teleologic approach.
AB  == the ability of three lactobacillus strains to inhibit the adhesion and growth of  naturally occurring uropathogens on silicone rubber was investigated in human urine. the importance of biosurfactant production by lactobacillus in discouraging uropathogen growth was determined in relation to the binding affinities of the lactobacilli for silicone rubber. l. fermentum b54 markedly inhibited uropathogen growth on the silicone rubber disks after 8 days for all five men included in the study, albeit to various extents ranging from 77% to 100%. in urine from women, however, this inhibition was less clear, as it was absent for two of the four women participating in this study. l. casei rhamnosus  36 completely discouraged uropathogen growth on the disks after 8 days for three  of the four women, whereas its effect in urine from men was less pronounced (inhibition ranged from 48% to 100% and was absent for one man). l. casei rhamnosus atcc 7469t was the least inhibitory lactobacillus strain tested and inhibition was absent for a number of both male and female participants, possibly as a result of the low binding affinity of this strain for silicone rubber and of its inability to release biosurfactants. we conclude that the inhibition of uropathogen growth is dependent on the lactobacillus strain involved, and for l.  fermentum b54 it was demonstrated to be sex-related. hence, inhibition must be considered a multifactorial process.

TI  == reduction of fecal shedding of enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7 in lambs by feeding microbial feed supplement.
AB  == enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7, an emerging food-borne pathogen, has  been implicated in several outbreaks in the us. ruminants, including cattle, sheep and deer are reservoirs of e. coli o157:h7 and fecal shedding of the pathogen forms the vehicle of entry into the human food chain. we studied the efficacy of lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus faecium, a mixture of l. acidophilus and s. faecium and a mixture of l. acidophilus, s. faecium, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus plantarum in reducing fecal shedding of e. coli o157:h7 by sheep experimentally infected with  the pathogen prior to administration with the microbials. following oral inoculation with 10(10)cfu of e. coli o157:h7, 30 suffolk ram lambs were blocked  by body weight (six blocks of five lambs each) and lambs within the block randomly assigned to five groups. the lamb groups were fed daily for 7 weeks a basal diet without microbial supplement (control) or the basal diet with l. acidophilus or with s. faecium or with a mixture of l. acidophilus and s. faecium or with a mixture of l. acidophilus, s. faecium, l. casei, l. fermentum and l. plantarum. the microbial supplements contained stabilized live naturally occurring bacteria and were mixed with the diet at the rate of 6.0x10(6)cfu per kilogram of diet. fecal samples were collected weekly and analyzed for e. coli o157:h7 using modified tryptic soy broth with novobiocin as a pre-enrichement broth and cefixim-tellurite sorbitol macconkey agar (ct-smac) as a selective media. e. coli o157:h7 was confirmed by its reaction with o157 and h7 antisera. e. coli o157:h7 was shed continuously and in varying numbers in the feces throughout the 7-week experimental period by all five groups. however, lambs administered a mixture of l. acidophilus, s. faecium, l. casei, l. fermentum and  l. plantarum shed significantly lower (p=0.0211) average number of e. coli o157:h7 (2.3log(10)cfu per gram of feces per week) than the other lamb groups over the entire experimental period. s. faecium supplemented lambs were comparable (p=0.0884) to lambs fed a mixture of l. acidophulus and s. faecium in  fecal shedding of the pathogen (3.5 versus 4.4log(10)cfu per gram of feces) but significantly lower (p=0.0001) than the control lambs (5.6log(10)cfu per gram of  feces) and those supplemented with l. acidophilus (5.5log(10)cfu per gram of feces). average daily gain (adg) and gain to feed ratio (g:f) were significantly  improved (p=0.0145) by the mixed culture microbials (163.0g and 0.33 for the control, 186.4g and 0.37 for l. acidophulus, 168.2g and 0.36 for s. faecium, 213.6g and 0.46 for l. acidophulus and s. faecium, and 219.1g and 0.44, respectively for l. acidophilus, s. faecium, l. casei, l. fermentum and l. plantarum supplemented lambs. the study indicates that supplementing lambs infected with e. coli o157:h7 with s. faecium or a mixture of s. faecium, l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. fermentum and l. plantarum in the diet can reduce total number of e. coli o157:h7 shed in the feces and improve animal meat production performance as well.

AB  == aim: the study was carried out to assess the agreement of api 50 ch fermentation  data of food lactobacilli with their rapd profiles to determine whether the system could be used alone as a reliable taxonomic tool for this genus. methods and results: api 50 ch, rapd and dna:dna reassociation data for 42 lactobacilli from tef and kocho were compared with 30 type strains. discrepancies were observed between the three methods in assigning strains of lactobacillus plantarum, lact. fermentum, weissella minor and lact. gallinarum, and lact. fermentum, lact. amylophilus, lact. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum and lact. rhamnosus. dna reassociation data agreed well with rapd results. conclusions: api 50 ch profiles should be complemented with molecular genetic results for effective identification in lactobacillus. significance and impact of the study:  the study suggested less dependability of metabolic data alone as an identification tool.

TI  == identification of collagen-binding proteins in lactobacillus spp. with surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization-time of flight proteinchip technology.
AB  == biosurfactants produced by lactobacillus fermentum rc-14, l. rhamnosus gr-1 and 36, and l. casei shirota were found to contain proteins that bind to both collagen types iii and vi, as determined by surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization (seldi)-time of flight mass spectrometry. both collagen types iii and vi immobilized on seldi preactivated proteinchip arrays detected several different sizes (2 to 48 kda) of collagen-binding proteins. overall, the  rc-14-produced biosurfactant contained the greatest number of collagen-binding proteins (rc-14 > gr-1 > 36 > shirota), including the mature form of a previously cloned 29-kda collagen-binding protein (referred to in its mature 26-kda form). although biosurfactants isolated from l. casei shirota and l. rhamnosus 36 and gr-1 also contain several collagen-binding proteins, they do not contain the 26-kda collagen-binding protein. together, these results demonstrate the utility  of the seldi system as a means of rapidly characterizing clinically important but complex biosurfactant solutions.

TI  == microbial community dynamics during production of the mexican fermented maize dough pozol.
AB  == the dynamics of the microbial community responsible for the traditional fermentation of maize in the production of mexican pozol was investigated by using a polyphasic approach combining (i) microbial enumerations with culture media, (ii) denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) fingerprinting of total community dna with bacterial and eukaryotic primers and sequencing of partial 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) genes, (iii) quantification of rrnas from dominant microbial taxa by using phylogenetic oligonucleotide probes, and (iv) analysis of sugars and fermentation products. a streptococcus species dominated the fermentation and accounted for between 25 and 75% of the total flora throughout the process. results also showed that the initial epiphytic aerobic microflora was replaced in the first 2 days by heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria (lab), including a close relative of lactobacillus fermentum, producing  lactic acid and ethanol; this heterolactic flora was then progressively replaced  by homofermentative lab (mainly close relatives of l. plantarum, l. casei, and l. delbrueckii) which continued acidification of the maize dough. at the same time,  a very diverse community of yeasts and fungi developed, mainly at the periphery of the dough. the analysis of the dgge patterns obtained with bacterial and eukaryotic primers targeting the 16s and 18s rdna genes clearly demonstrated that there was a major shift in the community structure after 24 h and that high biodiversity-according to the shannon-weaver index-was maintained throughout the  process. these results proved that a relatively high number of species, at least  six to eight, are needed to perform this traditional lactic acid fermentation. the presence of bifidobacterium, enterococcus, and enterobacteria suggests a fecal origin of some important pozol microorganisms. overall, the results obtained with different culture-dependent or -independent techniques clearly confirmed the importance of developing a polyphasic approach to study the ecology of fermented foods.

TI  == effect of probiotic bacteria on prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice prostheses in vitro.
AB  == the proliferation of yeasts in the mixed bacterial and fungal biofilms colonising silicone rubber voice prostheses in laryngectomised patients is the main cause of malfunctioning of the valve mechanism on the oesophageal side of the prostheses.  indwelling voice prostheses usually have to be replaced every 3-4 months. the consumption of probiotic bacteria is largely motivated by health claims related to the urogenital and lower digestive tract, but not to the upper digestive tract. the present study examined the influence of probiotic bacteria on the prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice prostheses, as formed in a modified robbins device. exposure of oropharyngeal biofilms on voice prostheses to suspensions of bifidobacterium infantis 420 or enterococcus faecium 603 did not significantly reduce the number of yeasts in the biofilm. however, suspensions of lactobacillus fermentum b54, l. rhamnosus 744 or l. lactis cremoris sk11 led to a reduction in the number of yeasts harvested from the voice prostheses. suspensions of l. casei shirota and streptococcus thermophilus b significantly reduced the number of yeasts in the biofilm to 39% and 33%, respectively. the reduction brought about in yeast prevalence in the mixed biofilm was greatest by exposure to a suspension of l. lactis 53, with yeast prevalence only 4% of the control. in conclusion, the study demonstrated that the prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice  prostheses might be controlled by consumption of probiotic bacteria.

TI  == molecular diversity of lactic acid bacteria from cassava sour starch (colombia).
AB  == lactic acid bacteria and more particularly lactobacilli and leuconostoc, are widely found in a wide variety of traditional fermented foods of tropical countries, made with cereals, tubers, meat or fish. these products represent a source of bacterial diversity that cannot be accurately analysed using classical  phenotypic and biochemical tests. in the present work, the identification and the molecular diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from cassava sour starch fermentation were assessed by using a combination of complementary molecular methods: randomly amplified polymorphic dna fingerprinting (rapd), plasmid profiling, hybridization using rrna phylogenetic probes and partial 16s rdna sequencing. the results revealed a large diversity of bacterial species (lb. manihotivorans, lb. plantarum, lb. casei, lb. hilgardii, lb. buchneri, lb. fermentum, ln. mesenteroides and pediococcus sp.). however, the most frequently isolated species were lb. plantarum and lb. manihotivorans. the rapd analysis revealed a large molecular diversity between lb. manihotivorans or lb. plantarum  strains. these results, observed on a rather limited number of samples, reveal that significant bacterial diversity is generated in traditional cassava sour starch fermentations. we propose that the presence of the amylolytic lb. manihotivorans strains could have a role in sour starch processing.

TI  == bacterial cell wall-induced arthritis: chemical composition and tissue distribution of four lactobacillus strains.
AB  == to study what determines the arthritogenicity of bacterial cell walls, cell wall-induced arthritis in the rat was applied, using four strains of lactobacillus. three of the strains used proved to induce chronic arthritis in the rat; all were lactobacillus casei. the cell wall of lactobacillus fermentum did not induce chronic arthritis. all arthritogenic bacterial cell walls had the  same peptidoglycan structure, whereas that of l. fermentum was different. likewise, all arthritogenic cell walls were resistant to lysozyme degradation, whereas the l. fermentum cell wall was lysozyme sensitive. muramic acid was observed in the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes in considerably larger amounts after injection of an arthritogenic l. casei cell wall than following injection of a nonarthritogenic l. fermentum cell wall. the l. casei cell wall also persisted in the tissues longer than the l. fermentum cell wall. the present results, taken together with those published previously, underline the possibility that the chemical structure of peptidoglycan is important in determining the arthritogenicity of the bacterial cell wall.

TI  == [cloning and gene expression in lactic acid bacteria].
AB  == the possibility of using the genera lactobacillus and lactococcus as vector representatives is widely discussed at present. the prospects of the construction of recombinant bacteria are closely connected with the solution of a number of problems: the level of the transcription of cloned genes, the effectiveness of the translation of heterologous mrna, the stability of protein with respect to bacterial intracellular proteases, the method by protein molecules leave the cell (by secretion or as the result of lysis). to prevent segregation instability, the construction of vector molecules on the basis of stable cryptic plasmids found in wild strains of lactic acid bacteria was proposed. high copying plasmids with low molecular weight were detected in l. plantarum and l. pentosus strains. several plasmids with molecular weights of 1.7, 1.8 and 2.3 kb were isolated from bacterial cells to be used as the basis for the construction of vector molecules. genes of chloramphenicol- and erythromycin-resistance from staphylococcus aureus  plasmids were used as marker genes ensuring cell transformation. the vector plasmids thus constructed exhibited high transformation activity in the electroporation of different strains, including l. casei, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. fermentum and l. brevis which could be classified with the replicons of a wide circle of hosts. but the use of these plasmids was limited due to the risk of the uncontrolled dissemination of recombinant plasmids. l. acidophilus were also found to have strictly specific plasmids with good prospects of being used as the basis for the creation of vectors, incapable of dissemination. in addition to the search of strain-specific plasmids, incapable of uncontrolled gene transmission, the use of chromosome-integrated heterologous  genes is recommended in cloning to ensure the maximum safety.

TI  == strain-dependent induction of cytokine profiles in the gut by orally administered lactobacillus strains.
AB  == different lactobacillus strains are frequently used in consumer food products. in addition, recombinant lactobacilli which contain novel expression vectors can now be used in immunotherapeutic applications such as oral vaccination strategies and in t cell tolerance induction approaches for autoimmune disease. both for food and clinical applications of lactobacilli, proper selection of wild type strains  is crucial. for that purpose, eight different common lactobacillus strains were analysed with respect to mucosal induction of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, iga-producing plasma cells in the gut, as well as systemic antibody responses against a parenterally administered antigen. immunohistochemical analysis of cytokine-producing cells in the gut villi showed no significant induction of the cytokines il-1alpha, ifn-gamma, il-4 or il-10 after oral administration of wild type lactobacillus strains. in contrast, oral administration of l. reuteri and l. brevis induced expression of the proinflammatory/th1 cytokines tnf-alpha, il-2 and/or il-1beta. oral administration of these two strains and l. fermentum also significantly enhanced  the igg response against parenterally administered haptenated chicken gamma globulin (tnp-cgg). the five other strains did not show this adjuvanticity. l. reuteri induced relatively high levels of igg2a compared to l. murines, a nonadjuving lactobacillus strain. these findings imply that different lactobacillus strains induce distinct mucosal cytokine profiles and possess differential intrinsic adjuvanticity. this suggests that rational lactobacillus strain selection provides a strategy to influence cytokine expression and thereby influence immune responses.

TI  == modulating immune responses with probiotic bacteria.
AB  == for many years, probiotic bacteria have been known to confer health benefits to the consumer. one possible mechanism for this may be the ability of probiotic bacteria to modulate immune responses. oral administration of lactobacillus casei strain shirota (lcs) has been found to enhance innate immunity by stimulating the activity of splenic nk cells. oral feeding with killed lcs was able to stimulate  the production of th1 cytokines, resulting in repressed production of ige antibodies against ovalbumin in experimental mice. the ability to switch mucosal  immune responses towards th1 with probiotic bacteria provides a strategy for treatment of allergic disorders. growth of meth a tumour cells in the lungs was also inhibited by intrapleural injection of lcs. oral administration of other probiotic bacteria, such as streptococcus thermophilus (st), lactobacillus fermentum (lf) and yeast (y), elicited different immune responses. mice that were prefed yeast or lf followed by feeding with ovalbumin (ova) responded better to vaccination with ova than mice not given either probiotic or ova or mice that had been prefed only ova. however, antibody responses were significantly suppressed in response to vaccination with ova in mice that had been prefed yeast followed by yeast and ova as well as mice prefed lf followed by lf and ova. prefeeding st  followed by ova feeding enhanced cellular immune responses against ovalbumin. in  contrast, mice prefed st followed by st + ova were hyporesponsive against ova. while antigen feeding alone appears to prime for an immune response, cofeeding antigen with probiotic bacteria can suppress both antibody and cellular immune responses and may provide an efficacious protocol to attenuate autoimmune diseases, such as experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, by jointly dosing with myelin basic protein and probiotic bacteria.

TI  == human cytokine responses induced by gram-positive cell walls of normal intestinal microbiota.
AB  == the normal microbiota plays an important role in the health of the host, but little is known of how the human immune system recognizes and responds to gram-positive indigenous bacteria. we have investigated cytokine responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) to gram-positive cell walls (cw) derived from four common intestinal indigenous bacteria, eubacterium aerofaciens  (eu.a. ), eubacterium limosum (eu.l.), lactobacillus casei (l.c.), and lactobacillus fermentum (l.f.). our results indicate that gram-positive cw of the normal intestinal microbiota can induce cytokine responses of the human pbmc. the profile, level and kinetics of these responses are similar to those induced by lipopolysaccharide (lps) or cw derived from a pathogen, streptococcus pyogenes (s.p.). bacterial cw are capable of inducing production of a proinflammatory cytokine, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha), and an anti-inflammatory cytokine, il-10, but not that of il-4 or interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma). monocytes  are the main cell population in pbmc to produce tnf-alpha and il-10. induction of cytokine secretion is serum-dependent; both cd14-dependent and -independent pathways are involved. these findings suggest that the human cytokine responses induced by gram-positive cw of the normal intestinal microbiota are similar to those induced by lps or gram-positive cw of the pathogens.

TI  == collagen (cn-i) binding by gut lactobacilli.
AB  == four gut lactobacillus strains displaying the features which make them particularly promising for the preparation of probiotic products were investigated together with 5 fresh isolates and one collection strain of lactobacillus plantarum for their ability to bind type i collagen (cn-i). immobilised cn-i in microtitre plates was bound only by 3 strains of gut lactobacilli from piglets and the collection strain lactobacillus plantarum lhi 10 from prague in range of a570nm readings 0.114-0.221. six strains (isolates from turkeys and a calf) did not bind cn-i (a570nm < 0.1) in this assay. an influence of cultivation medium on cn-i binding was significant (p < 0.001) in all four adherent strains. significantly higher (p < 0.001) binding of cn-i was observed for lactobacillus casei l 81 and lactobacillus plantarum lhi 10 grown on solid medium (mrs agar) than for mrs broth-grown cells, however, lactobacillus plantarum l 5 and lactobacillus fermentum l 435 expressed significantly (p < 0.001) higher cn-i binding during cultivation in mrs broth. the specificity of the binding was confirmed because the cn-i binding by lactobacilli after their preincubation with this protein was completely abolished. three selected inhibitors (fucoidan, heparan sulphate and hyaluronic acid) significantly (p < 0.001) reduced cn-i binding by the lactobacillus plantarum l 5 strain. following  up on some earlier strain characteristics, these results suggest that the selected piglets lactobacilli are also able to bind cn-i and therefore should antagonize collagen niche colonization by various enteropathogens when used for probiotic purposes.

TI  == taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the current taxonomy of probiotic lactic acid bacteria is reviewed with special focus on the genera lactobacillus, bifidobacterium and enterococcus. the physiology and taxonomic position of species and strains of these genera were investigated by phenotypic and genomic methods. in total, 176 strains, including  the type strains, have been included. phenotypic methods applied were based on biochemical, enzymatical and physiological characteristics, including growth temperatures, cell wall analysis and analysis of the total soluble cytoplasmatic  proteins. genomic methods used were pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge), randomly amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) and dna-dna hybridization for bifidobacteria. in the genus lactobacillus the following species of importance as probiotics were investigated: l. acidophilus group, l. casei group and l. reuteri/l. fermentum group. most strains referred to as l. acidophilus in probiotic products could be identified either as l. gasseri or as l. johnsonii, both members of the l. acidophilus group. a similar situation could be shown in the l. casei group, where most of the strains named l. casei belonged to l. paracasei subspp. a recent proposal to reject the species l. paracasei and to include this species in the restored species l. casei with a neotype strain was supported by protein analysis. bifidobacterium spp. strains have been reported to be used for production of fermented dairy and recently of probiotic products. according to phenotypic features and confirmed by dna-dna hybridization most of the bifidobacteria strains from dairy origin belonged to b. animalis, although they were often declared as b. longum by the manufacturer. from the genus enterococcus, probiotic ec. faecium strains were investigated with regard to the  vana-mediated resistance against glycopeptides. these unwanted resistances could  be ruled out by analysis of the 39 kda resistance protein. in conclusion, the taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria can only be understood  by using polyphasic taxonomy combining morphological, biochemical and physiological characteristics with molecular-based phenotypic and genomic techniques.

TI  == development and application of an in vitro methodology to determine the transit tolerance of potentially probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species in the upper human gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == an in vitro methodology which mimics in vivo human upper gastrointestinal transit was developed. the transit tolerance of potentially probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species was determined by exposing washed cell suspensions at 37  degrees c to a simulated gastric juice (ph 2.0), containing pepsin (0.3% w/v) and sodium chloride (0.5% w/v), and a simulated small intestinal juice (ph 8.0), containing pancreatin usp (1 g l-1) and sodium chloride (5 g l-1), and monitoring changes in total viable count periodically. the methodology was also employed to  determine the effect of adding milk proteins (1 g l-1), hog gastric mucin (1 g l-1) and soyabean trypsinchymotrypsin inhibitor [sbtci] (1 g l-1) on transit tolerance. the majority (14 of 15) of isolates lost > 90% viability during simulated gastric transit. only one isolate, lactobacillus fermentum kld, was considered intrinsically resistant. the addition of milk proteins, singly and in  combination, generally improved gastric transit tolerance. in this regard, two isolates, lact. casei 212.3 and bifidobacterium infantis 25962, exhibited 100% gastric transit tolerance in the presence of milk proteins. in general, the addition of hog gastric mucin did not influence simulated gastric transit tolerance of lactobacilli but tended to increase that of bifidobacteria. however, it increased that of lact. casei 242 and lact. salivarius 43338 but diminished that of b. bifidum 2715 and b. animalis bo. selected bile salts-resistant isolates were intrinsically tolerant to simulated small intestinal transit. only  lact. casei f19 and b. adolescentis 15703t showed significant reduction in viability after 240 min. in general, the addition of milk proteins and sbtci did  not affect simulated small intestinal transit tolerance. however, they significantly improved the intrinsic resistance of lact. casei f19 but diminished that of b. breve 15700t. it is concluded that, whereas the majority of bile salts-resistant lactobacilli and bifidobacteria may be intrinsically sensitive to gastric transit, they are intrinsically resistant to small intestinal transit. in addition, it is postulated that milk proteins and mucin may function as both buffering agents and inhibitors of digestive protease activity in vivo, thereby protecting ingested bacterial strains during upper gastrointestinal transit.

TI  == use of sulfite and hydrogen peroxide to control bacterial contamination in ethanol fermentation.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria isolated from an industrial-scale ethanol fermentation process were used to evaluate sulfite as a bacterial-contamination control agent  in a cell-recycled continuous ethanol fermentation process. the viabilities of bacteria were decreased by sulfite at concentrations of 100 to 400 mg liter-1, while sulfite at the same concentrations did not change the viability of the saccharomyces cerevisiae strain used in this process. sulfite was effective only  in the presence of oxygen. bacteria showed differences in their susceptibilities  to sulfite. facultatively heterofermentative lactobacillus casei 4-3 was more susceptible than was obligatory heterofermentative lactobacillus fermentum 7-1. the former showed higher enzyme activities involved in the production and consumption of hydrogen peroxide than did the latter. the viability of l. fermentum 7-1 could be selectively controlled by hydrogen peroxide at concentrations of 1 to 10 mm. based on these findings, it is hypothesized that the sulfur trioxide radical anions formed by peroxidase in the presence of hydrogen peroxide are responsible for the control of contaminating bacteria. sulfite did not kill the yeast strain, which has catalase to degrade hydrogen peroxide. a cell-recycled continuous ethanol fermentation process was run successfully with sulfite treatments.

AB  == in this study, 15 lactobacillus isolates were found to produce biosurfactants in  the mid-exponential and stationary growth phases. the stationary-phase biosurfactants from lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus 36 and atcc 7469, lactobacillus fermentum b54, and lactobacillus acidophilus rc14 were investigated further to determine their capacity to inhibit the initial adhesion of uropathogenic enterococcus faecalis 1131 to glass in a parallel-plate flow chamber. the initial deposition rate of e. faecalis to glass with an adsorbed biosurfactant layer from l. acidophilus rc14 or l. fermentum b54 was significantly decreased by approximately 70%, while the number of adhering enterococci after 4 h of adhesion was reduced by an average of 77%. the surface activity of the biosurfactants and their activity inhibiting the initial adhesion of e. faecalis 1131 were retained after dialysis (molecular weight cutoff, 6,000  to 8,000) and freeze-drying. fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the freeze-dried biosurfactants from l.  acidophilus rc14 and l. fermentum b54 were richest in protein, while those from l. casei subsp. rhamnosus 36 and atcc 7469 had relatively high polysaccharide and phosphate contents.

TI  == the potential of lactobacillus as a carrier for oral immunization: development and preliminary characterization of vector systems for targeted delivery of antigens.
AB  == oral administration of lactobacilli evokes mucosal and systemic immune responses  against epitopes associated with these organisms (gerritse et al., 1990, 1991). the adjuvant function of different lactobacillus species was investigated under the conditions of intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection or oral administration. after  i.p. injection of trinitrophenylated chicken gamma-globulin, high dth responses were observed with lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus plantarum, but low responses with lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. in different experimental model systems l. casei and l. plantarum consistently showed significant adjuvanticity. a series of expression and expression-secretion vectors containing the strong constitutive promoter of the l. casei l-ldh gene or the regulatable promoter of the lactobacillus amylovorus amy gene (pouwels and leer, 1995) was used for the intracellular, extracellular and surface-bound expression of an influenza virus antigenic determinant fused to escherichia coli beta-glucuronidase. intracellular expression of the fusion protein amounted to 1-2% of total soluble protein. lactobacilli synthesizing the  fusion protein intracellularly evoked an oral immune response after subcutaneous  priming.

TI  == comparison of proteolytic activities in various lactobacilli.
AB  == a total of 169 lactobacillus strains from 12 species (lb. acidophilus, lb. brevis, lb. buchneri, lb. casei, lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lb. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii, lb. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lb. fermentum, lb. helveticus, lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei, lb. plantarum and lb. rhamnosus), isolated from raw milk and various milk products, and 9 lactococcus lactis strains were evaluated for peptidase activities with five chromogenic substrates  and a tryptic digest of casein. within each species, the peptidase activity of the cell-free extracts of the strains varied. furthermore, differences were observed between the lactobacillus species and lc. lactis. lb. helveticus had by  far the highest hydrolysing activities towards all substrates, indicating the presence of powerful aminopeptidases, x-prolyl-dipeptidyl aminopeptidases and proline iminopeptidases. lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus possessed high hydrolysing activities towards substrates containing proline, alanyl-prolyl-p-nitroanilide and prolyl-p-nitroanilide. on the other hand, lb. fermentum and lb. brevis could be considered as weakly proteolytic species. a more detailed study with highly proteolytic lactobacillus strains indicated that  at least three different proteinases or endopeptidases were present. compared with lc. lactis, the lactobacillus strains had a much lower hydrolytic action on  glutamyl-glutamic acid, suggesting that glutamyl aminopeptidase was absent in lactobacilli.

AB  == the substrate range of phosphoenolpyruvate:hexose phosphotransferase systems (hexose-ptss) in lactobacillus casei subsp. casei lac3 and l. acidophilus lac5 was examined. strain lac3 demonstrated pts activities for glucose (glc), mannose  (man), glucosamine (gcn), 2-deoxyglucose (2dg) and fructose (fru), while strain lac5 showed the activities only for man and fru. these activities were all constitutive. growth of both strains was strongly inhibited by 2dg. 2dg-resistant mutants dg329 and dg504 were isolated, respectively, from strains lac3 and lac5.  mutant dg329 grown on glc was defective in all the above-described activities observed with strain lac3, whereas no defect in pts activities was found in mutant dg504. mutant dg329, however, showed some inducible activities for man and fru when grown on man, fru or scr. these results strongly suggest that strain lac3 has inducible pts(s) specific for man and/or fru besides the well-known, broadly specific, constitutive man-pts, and also that strain lac5 lacks the man-pts, but has other constitutive pts(s) specific for man and/or fru. l. fermentum lac12 had the man-pts as reported previously (nagasaki et al., 1992), but had no inducible activities like those found in strain lac3.

TI  == incompatibility of lactobacillus vectors with replicons derived from small cryptic lactobacillus plasmids and segregational instability of the introduced vectors.
AB  == three new lactobacillus vectors based on cryptic lactobacillus plasmids were constructed. the shuttle vector plp3537 consists of a 2.3-kb plasmid from lactobacillus pentosus md353, an erythromycin resistance gene from staphylococcus aureus plasmid pe194, and puc19 as a replicon for escherichia coli. the vectors plpe317 and plpe323, which do not contain e. coli sequences, were generated by introducing the erythromycin resistance gene of pe194 into a 1.7- and a 2.3-kb plasmid from l. pentosus md353, respectively. these vectors and the shuttle vector plp825 (m. posno, r. j. leer, j. m. m. van rijn, b. c. lokman, and p. h. pouwels, p. 397-401, in a. t. ganesan and j. a. hoch, ed., genetics and biotechnology of bacilli, vol. 2, 1988) could be introduced by electroporation into lactobacillus casei, l. pentosus, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, and l. brevis strains with similar efficiencies. transformation efficiencies were strain dependent and varied from 10 to 10 transformants per mug of dna. plasmid dna analysis of l. pentosus md353 transformants revealed that the introduction of plp3537 or plpe323 was invariably accompanied by loss of the endogenous 2.3-kb plasmid. remarkably, plpe317 could only be introduced into an l. pentosus md353 strain that had been previously cured of its endogenous 1.7-kb  plasmid. the curing phenomena are most likely to be explained by the incompatibility of the vectors and resident plasmids. lactobacillus vectors are generally rapidly lost when cells are cultivated in the absence of selective pressure. however, plpe323 is stable in three of four lactobacillus strains tested so far.

TI  == superoxide dismutase activity in some strains of lactobacilli: induction by manganese.
AB  == dialyzed cell-free extract of lactobacilli was found to contain superoxide dismutase activity by using a test system in which superoxide ion is generated by xanthine oxidase. the specific activities of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus murinus atcc 35020, lactobacillus acidophilus crl 358, lactobacillus plantarum atcc 8014, lactobacillus casei crl 431, lactobacillus plantarum crl 353, lactobacillus fermentum atcc 9338, lactobacillus buchneri ncdo 110, and lactobacillus fermentum crl 251 were between 0.06 and 0.43 u/mg protein. the presence of superoxide dismutase activity was demonstrated when the strains were grown in media containing mn2+ ions. superoxide dismutase of lactobacilli may be an mn enzyme since it was not inhibited by either cyanide or azide ions. however, the cell-free extract of lactobacillus murinus atcc 35020 contains superoxide dismutase activity sensitive to both ions.

TI  == the effect of ph on the sensitivity of species of lactobacillus to chlorhexidine  and the antibiotics minocycline and spiramycin.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the sensitivity of a range of lactobacillus species to chlorhexidine, minocycline, and spiramycin, at a range of ph from 5.0 to 7.4. strains of streptococcus were also tested for their sensitivity to chlorhexidine, as a comparison between the genera. there were both inter- and intra-species variations in the sensitivity of these strains to chlorhexidine. the strains tested were sensitive at ph 6.7 to the following levels of chlorhexidine (micrograms/ml): l. casei (6 strains), 10-60; l. plantarum (4 strains), 40; l. fermentum (13 strains), 2-20; l. brevis (1 strain), 10; and l. acidophilus (3 strains), 10-60. the streptococcus species were sensitive to 1-4 micrograms/ml (13 strains); 4-10 micrograms/ml (3 strains); and  10-20 micrograms/ml (2 strains). one strain was able to survive 20 micrograms/ml. chlorhexidine was found to be less effective at lower ph levels. the following examples show sensitivity (micrograms/ml) at ph 6.5 followed by sensitivity at ph 5.0: l. casei (atcc 15008), 40,60; l. plantarum (ch 374), 40,100; l. fermentum (ch 324) 10,40; l. acidophilus (atcc 4356), 10,40; and s. mutans (bm 52), 2,2. all of the strains of lactobacillus tested with spiramycin were resistant at ph 5.0. minocycline was less affected by changes in ph, but at ph 7.4 lactobacillus  strains were more resistant to minocycline as compared with spiramycin. both of these antibiotics are bacteriostatic, and therefore may have a more limited effect than a bactericidal agent such as chlorhexidine. the lactobacillus strains tested required higher concentrations of chlorhexidine than did the strains of streptococcus for a killing effect in vitro.

TI  == correlation between increase in ia-bearing macrophages and induction of t cell-dependent antitumor activity by lactobacillus casei in mice.
AB  == when lactobacillus casei yit 9018 (lc 9018) or corynebacterium parvum, known to be immunomodulators possessing antitumor activity, were injected i.p. into balb/c mice, peritoneal exudate macrophage ia antigen detected by indirect immunofluorescence method was expressed on their cell surface, but it was not expressed following the injection of 10% proteose peptone, an inflammatory agent, or lactobacillus fermentum yit 0159 (lf 0159), which have no antitumor activity.  the percentage and absolute number of ia-positive peritoneal macrophages were maximum on the 7th day after the injection of lc 9018. immunization by injection  of meth a fibrosarcoma cells treated with mitomycin c (mmc-meth a) 7 days after lc 9018 injection suppressed the growth of meth a implanted i.p. 14 days after mmc-meth a injection. a shorter interval between the injections of lc 9018 and mmc-meth a did not allow suppression of meth a growth. these results showed that  the increase in ia-positive macrophages in the peritoneal cavity coincided with the effective interval for induction of the antitumor activity by lc 9018. the antitumor activity induced by injections of lc 9018 and mmc-meth a did not affect the growth of rl male 1 leukemic cells, syngeneic to balb/c mice. neutralization  (winn type) tests showed that peritoneal t lymphocytes possessed tumor cytotoxicity and that the antitumor capacity was reduced by in vivo treatment with anti i-ad monoclonal antibody simultaneously with and 1 day prior to mmc-meth a injection. these results indicate that lc 9018-induced ia-positive macrophages, which first encounter a tumor antigen in the peritoneal cavity, play an important role in the in vivo induction of tumor specific t cell-mediated antitumor immunity.

TI  == host-mediated antiviral activity of lactobacillus casei against cytomegalovirus infection in mice.
AB  == the protective effect of heat-killed lactobacillus casei (lc) against murine cytomegalovirus (mcmv) infection was examined. icr mice treated once with lc 1 day or 2 days before challenge survived lethal infection, but untreated or lactobacillus fermentum (lf)-treated mice did not. the protective effect was evidenced by an increase in plaque-forming units (pfu) per 50% lethal dose (ld50) and a decrease in titers of infectious viruses replicated in the target organs. this was further confirmed by severity of histopathological damage to the target  organs, especially the liver. lc neither inactivated mcmv nor inhibited its replication in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (mef). the spleen cells from lc-treated mice inhibited its replication in mef on co-cultivation. augmentation  by lc of splenic natural killer (nk) cell activity correlated with survival of mice from otherwise lethal mcmv infection. cytotoxic activity of peritoneal cells and level of serum interferon (ifn) were elevated after mcmv infection, but they  were not associated with survival of mice nor with treatment of lc. the protective effect of lc was not clear in nk-deficient beige mutant (bgj/bgj) mice, when compared with that in their littermate (bgj/+) mice. poor protection of bgj/bgj mice by lc treatment correlated with failure to induce nk cell activity by lc treatment in the mutant mice. thus, it is likely that lc protects  mice from mcmv infection by augmentation of nk cell activity.

AB  == germfree (gf) f344 rats developed severe adjuvant-induced arthritis with a 100% incidence after a single intradermal injection of heat-killed mycobacterium bovis (bcg). specific pathogene-free (spf) rats developed less severe arthritis with a  lower incidence. the rats colonized with escherichia coli or bacteroides developed mild disease comparable to that in spf rats. the rats colonized with bifidobacterium, propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus casei, l. fermentum, l. murini, and l. acidophilus developed more severe disease than that in gf rats. furthermore, the rats colonized with a mixture of e. coli and the above lactobacilli developed very mild disease similar to that in spf rats. these results suggest that gram-negative bacteria, such as e. coli and bacteroides, may suppress the disease, possibly through their lipopolysaccharides, and may be responsible for the lower susceptibility of spf rats; gram-positive bacteria, such as bifidobacterium, p. acnes, and lactobacilli, may enhance the disease, possibly through their peptidoglycans; and e. coli may play a dominant role in modulating the development of adjuvant-induced arthritis.

TI  == interaction of streptococcus mutans glucosyltransferases with teichoic acids.

AB  == the reassembly of tetragonally arranged subunits in the cell wall of lactobacillus brevis and the reattachment of the subunits to cell wall fragments  were investigated by electron microscopy. the subunits dissociated from the cell  wall with guanidine hydrochloride (ghcl) reassembled into the same regular array  as seen in native cell wall after dialysis against neutral buffer even in the absence of specific cations. the subunits could also reattach to the cell wall fragments from which they had been removed by treatment with ghcl, sodium dodecyl sulfate or cold trichloroacetic acid but not to those treated with hot formamide. heterologous reattachment of the subunits occurred on cell wall fragments obtained from l. fermentum but not on those from l plantarum or l. casei subsp. casei. on the basis of these observations and chemical analyses of the cell wall  fragments, the subunits of l. brevis appeared to be bound by hydrogen bonds to a  neutral polysaccharide moiety in the cell wall but not to peptidoglycan or teichoic acid.

TI  == in vitro studies on distribution of indigenous lactobacilli of the gastrointestinal tract of rats.
AB  == to learn the biochemical mechanisms controlling the distribution of indigenous lactobacilli in the gastrointestinal tracts of rats, the effect of ph and stomach and cecal contents on lactobacillus distribution was investigated in vitro with a mixed culture of three lactobacillus strains isolated from the rat intestine. the ph of the growth medium affected the growth of lactobacilli strongly, irrespective of the lumenal contents. lactobacillus fermentum outnumbered l. acidophilus and l. murini at low ph (ph 4.5; average ph of stomach contents of conventional rats) but at near neutral ph (ph 6.5; average ph of cecal contents of conventional rats), the growth of l. murini was predominant with all strains.  more lactic acid was formed by lactobacilli in medium consisting of stomach contents than in cecal contents medium. l. murini grew in the nondialyzable fraction of the stomach contents and l. fermentum grew in the dialyzable fraction, but l. acidophilus did not grow in either fraction. l. murini grew in the nondialyzable fraction treated with hyaluronidase. in contrast, the nondialyzable fraction treated with pronase or chondroitinase did not allow l. murini to grow at all.

TI  == extractability of cell wall polysaccharide from lactobacilli and streptococci by  autoclaving and by dilue acid.
AB  == autoclaving cell wall of streptococcus mutans ingbritt for 15 min under the rantz and randall conditions released one-tenth of the total cell wall carbohydrate, whereas two-thirds was extracted after autoclaving for 180 min. the extract contained the serotype c-specific antigen but lacked the lipoteichoic acid component extracted when whole cells were autoclaved. autoclaving cell wall preparations from other strains of s. mutans and also streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mitis in 0.85% nacl for 180 min released the major proportion of the wall polysaccharide fraction. approximately 50 to 90% of wall carbohydrate of lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus casei was released when cell wall preparations were autoclaved in 0.85% nacl for 180 min. for wall preparations from several strains of s. mutans, autoclaving for 60 min at ph 3.75 released only 39 to 62% of wall carbohydrate, whereas almost total release could be achieved with the lactobacilli. heating s. mutans ingbritt cell wall for 24 h at  60 degrees c in 0.1 n h(2)so(4) released only two-thirds of the wall carbohydrate; by comparison nearly all of the wall carbohydrate was released in 3 h from l. casei and l. fermentum. autoclaving l. casei cell wall and purified soluble wall fractions hydrolyzed the phosphodiester bond between the polysaccharide and peptidoglycan. this was shown by the release of reactive n-acetylhexosamine in both cases and the presence of a phosphomonoester in the autoclaved soluble wall fractions. the results indicate that autoclaving can hydrolyze covalent linkages, and this must be considered when the rantz and randall procedure is used to obtain antigen preparations.

TI  == [the microflora of sour dough. iv. communication: bacterial composition of sourdough starters genus lactobacillus beijerinck (author's transl)].
AB  == the bacterial composition of three so called pure culture sourdough starters of varying origin was investigated. 245 isolates were obtained all belonging to the  genus beijerinck. according to their morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics they were classified into the subgroups: thermobacterium (l. acidophilus), streptobacterium (l. casei, l. plantarum, l. farciminis, l. alimentarius) and betabacterium (l. brevis, l. brevis var. lindneri, l buchneri,  l. fermentum, l. fructi vorans). in the three sourdough starters the identified lactic organisms varied in number and proportion. in starter preparation "a" only the varieties l. fructi vorans and l. fermentum were present. preparation "b" contained a great variety of microorganisms with l. brevis and l. brevis l. lindneri predominating. in starter "c" l. brevis, l. plantarum and l. alimentarius predominated.

TI  == formation of extracellular lipoteichoic acid by oral streptococci and lactobacilli.
AB  == examination of the culture fluids from a number of strains of oral streptococci and latobacilli has shown the presence of an erythrocyte-sensitizing antigen with the properties of lipoteichoic acid. the antigen was isolated from the culture fluids of lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus fermentum and characterized chemically and serologically, for other strains, serological evidence for the presence of lipoteichoic acid depends on the reactivity with antiserum specific for the glycerol phosphate backbone. the relative concentrations of the antigen in culture fluids from different organisms, in culture fluids from different stages of growth, and in extracts of organisms was estimated by determining the maximum dilution that fully sensitized erythrocytes; the culture fluid titer, which is the reciprocal of the dilution, varied from 4 to 320. strains of streptococcus mutans were generally characterized by a high level of extracellular lipoteichoic acid, the amount being greater than that detectable in cell extracts; this conclusion was confirmed by using the quantitative precipitin method. a high-molecular-weight fraction obtained from s. mutans bht culture fluid was effective in sensitizing erythrocytes at a concentration of 1 mug/ml, compared with 2 mug/ml required for cellular lipoteichoic acid from l. casei. the detecting procedure depends on the teichoic acid sensitizing erythrocytes but, as shown with l. fermentum, low-molecular-weight nonsensitizing teichoic acid may also be present in culture fluid.
