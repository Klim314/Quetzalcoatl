TI  - Antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 Lactobacillus and three Bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. Agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (pH 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; CFS) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; CFW) from de Man-Rogosa-Sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. Acid CFS and CFW showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against C. albicans. Neutralized CFS/CFW assays showed six strains active against S. aureus (L. acidophilus L-1, L. brevis 1, L. fermentum 1, B. animalis subsp. lactis L-3), E. coli (L. bulgaricus 6) or B. cereus (L. plantarum 24-4capital VE, Cyrillic). Inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized CFS (L. bulgaricus 6, L. helveticus 3, L. plantarum 24-2L, L. fermentum 1)/CFW (L. plantarum 24-5D, L. plantarum 24-4capital VE, Cyrillic) was detected. Some strains maintained activity after pH neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. The antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by the Epsilometer test method. All strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. Four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (L. rhamnosus Lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (L. acidophilus L-1 and L. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; L. casei L-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). Vancomycin MICs > 256 mug/mL indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. The antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.
TI  - Purification and characterization of a novel plantaricin, KL-1Y, from Lactobacillus plantarum KL-1.
AB  - Three bacteriocins from Lactobacillus plantarum KL-1 were successfully purified using ammonium sulfate precipitation, cation-exchange chromatography and reverse-phase HPLC. The bacteriocin peptides KL-1X, -1Y and -1Z had molecular masses of 3053.82, 3498.16 and 3533.16 Da, respectively. All three peptides were stable at pH 2-12 and 25 degrees C and at high temperatures of 80 and 100 degrees C for 30 min and 121 degrees C for 15 min. However, they differed in their susceptibility to proteolytic enzymes and their inhibition spectra. KL-1Y showed broad inhibitory activities against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis DMST 17368, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 15442, P. aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Escherichia coli O157:H7 and E. coli ATCC 8739. KL-1X and -1Z inhibited only Gram-positive bacteria. KL-1X, KL-1Y and KL-1Z exhibited synergistic activity. The successful amino acid sequencing of KL-1Y had a hydrophobicity of approximately 30 % and no cysteine residues suggested its novelty, and it was designated "plantaricin KL-1Y". Plantaricin KL-1Y exhibited bactericidal activity against Bacillus cereus JCM 2152(T). Compared to nisin, KL-1Y displayed broad inhibitory activities of 200, 800, 1600, 800, 400 and 400 AU/mL against the growth of Bacillus coagulans JCM 2257(T), B. cereus JCM 2152(T), Listeria innocua ATCC 33090(T), Staphylococcus aureus TISTR 118, E. coli O157:H7 and E. coli ATCC 8739, respectively, whereas nisin had similar activities against only B. coagulans JCM 2257(T) and B. cereus JCM 2152(T). Therefore, the novel plantaricin KL-1Y is a promising antimicrobial substance for food safety uses in the future.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria: promising supplements for enhancing the biological activities of kombucha.
AB  - Kombucha is sweetened black tea that is fermented by a symbiosis of bacteria and  yeast embedded within a cellulose membrane. It is considered a health drink in many countries because it is a rich source of vitamins and may have other health benefits. It has previously been reported that adding lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus) strains to kombucha can enhance its biological functions, but in that study only lactic acid bacteria isolated from kefir grains were tested. There are many other natural sources of lactic acid bacteria. In this study, we examined the effects of lactic acid bacteria from various fermented Vietnamese food sources (pickled cabbage, kefir and kombucha) on kombucha's three main biological functions: glucuronic acid production, antibacterial activity and antioxidant ability. Glucuronic acid production was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, antibacterial activity was assessed by the agar-well diffusion method and antioxidant ability was evaluated by determining the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging capacity. Four strains of food-borne pathogenic bacteria were used in our antibacterial experiments: Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19111, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Salmonella typhimurium ATCC 14028 and Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778. Our findings showed that lactic acid bacteria strains isolated from kefir are superior to those from other sources for improving glucuronic acid production and enhancing the antibacterial and antioxidant activities of kombucha. This study illustrates the potential of Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus plantarum isolated from kefir as biosupplements for enhancing the bioactivities of kombucha.
TI  - Antioxidant and antibacterial activities of exopolysaccharides from Bifidobacterium bifidum WBIN03 and Lactobacillus plantarum R315.
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the antioxidant and antibacterial  activities of exopolysaccharide (EPS) from Bifidobacterium bifidum WBIN03 (B-EPS) and Lactobacillus plantarum R315 (L-EPS). The 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)-radical scavenging, hydroxyl radical-scavenging, and superoxide radical-scavenging abilities were measured to evaluate antioxidant activity. Inhibition of erythrocyte hemolysis and lipid peroxidation was also measured. Both B-EPS and L-EPS had strong scavenging ability against DPPH and superoxide radicals at high concentration. The inhibitory effect of B-EPS on erythrocyte hemolysis was stronger than that of L-EPS in a concentration range from 0.30 to 1.00 mg/mL, whereas the hydroxyl scavenging ability of L-EPS (39.15 +/- 0.58%) was significantly higher than that of 0.15 mg/mL ascorbic acid (24.33 +/- 1.17%) and B-EPS (17.89 +/- 3.30%) at 0.10 mg/mL. The inhibition of lipid peroxidation of 0.50 mg/mL B-EPS and L-EPS was 13.48 +/- 1.74% and 12.43 +/- 0.51%, respectively, values lower than that of ascorbic acid at the same concentration (23.20 +/- 1.41%). Furthermore, all these abilities were enhanced in a concentration-dependent manner. Agar diffusion assay showed that both EPS exhibited antibacterial activities against tested pathogens such as Cronobacter sakazakii, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphyloccocus aureus, Candida albicans, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhimurium, and Shigella sonnei at 300 mug/mL. In conclusion, both EPS have antimicrobial and antioxidant activities and could have applications in the food industry.
TI  - Screening of marine bacteria with bacteriocin-like activities and probiotic potential for ornate spiny lobster (Panulirus ornatus) juveniles.
AB  - Bacteriocins are ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides, which have been  found in diverse bacterial species of terrestrial origins and some from the sea. New bacteriocins with new characteristics, new origins and new applications are likely still awaiting discovery. The present study screened bacteria isolated from marine animals of interest to the aquaculture industry for antimicrobial and bacteriocin-like activities in order to uncover biodiversity of bacteriocin producers, and explore the potential application in aquaculture. In total, 24 of 100 screened isolates showed antimicrobial activities and 7 of these exerted bacteriocin-like activities. Sequencing of 16S rRNA genes identified the isolates as members of the six genera Proteus, Providencia, Klebsiella, Alcaligenes, Bacillus and Enterococcus. In some cases, further analysis of housekeeping genes, rpoB for Proteus and recA for Klebsiella, as well as biochemical tests was necessary for identification to species level, and some of the Proteus isolates may represent novel species. The seven bacteriocinogenic isolates showed a wide antimicrobial spectrum against foodborne and animal pathogens, which opens the way to their potential use as marine drugs and probiotics in food, aquaculture, livestock and clinical settings. As a case study, the protective effect of shortlisted bacteriocinogenic isolates were tested in aquaculture-raised spiny lobster (Panulirus ornatus) juveniles. A single-strain (Bacillus pumilus B3.10.2B) and a three-strain (B. pumilus B3.10.2B, Bacillus cereus D9, Lactobacillus plantarum T13) probiotic preparation were added to the feed of Panulirus ornatus juveniles, which were subsequently challenged with the pathogen Vibrio owensii DY05. Juveniles in the probiotic treatments displayed increased growth and reduced feed conversion rates after 60 days, and increased survival rate after pathogen challenge relative to the control. This study represents the first evidence of bacteriocin production by bacteria associated with lobster, tiger shrimp, snubnose pompano and cobia and the first description of V. owensii as a pathogen in P. ornatus juveniles.
TI  - Evaluation of indirect impedance for measuring microbial growth in complex food matrices.
AB  - The suitability of indirect impedance to accurately measure microbial growth in real food matrices was investigated. A variety of semi-solid and liquid food products were inoculated with Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteriditis, Candida tropicalis or Zygosaccharomyces rouxii and CO2 production was monitored using a conductimetric (Don Whitely R.A.B.I.T.) system. The majority (80%) of food and microbe combinations produced a detectable growth signal. The linearity of conductance responses in selected food products was investigated and a good correlation (R(2) >/= 0.84) was observed between inoculum levels and times to detection. Specific growth rate estimations from the data were sufficiently accurate for predictive modeling in some cases. This initial evaluation of the suitability of indirect impedance to generate microbial growth data in complex food matrices indicates significant potential for the technology as an alternative to plating methods.
TI  - Soy whey based medium for optimized phytase activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae  MTCC 5421 and alpha-D-galactosidase and antibacterial activities in Lactobacillus plantarum MTCC 5422 by response surface methodology.
AB  - Soy whey based growth medium for yeast enabled the native isolate of Saccharomyces cerevisiae MTCC 5421 to produce 198 U/ml of phytase activity against that of 135 U/ml in potato dextrose broth. In the same medium for lactic acid bacteria, the isolate of Lactobacillus plantarum MTCC 5422 was able to elaborate alpha-D-galactosidase activity of 10.6 U/ml in comparison to 6 U/ml in Lactobacillus MRS broth. Using this formulated medium, a central composite experimental design based on 5 variables of 3 factors namely incubation temperature, pH level and incubation period showed that S. cerevisiae could produce 200 U/ml of phytase in 36 h at 30 degrees C and pH 3.5. Similarly, L. plantarum in 33 h at 37 degrees C and pH 6.6 exhibited 14.2 U/ml of alpha-D-galactosidase activity, whereas the antibacterial activity of 14.4 AU/ml against Bacillus cereus was evident in 42 h at 42 degrees C and pH 6.0. The phytase and antibacterial activity units visualized in response surface plots were more or less close to those obtained with the experimental design treatments.
TI  - Isolation and identification of a new intracellular antimicrobial peptide produced by Paenibacillus alvei AN5.
AB  - A wild-type, Gram-positive, rod-shaped, endospore-forming and motile bacteria has been isolated from palm oil mill sludge in Malaysia. Molecular identification using 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that the bacteria belonged to genus Paenibacillus. With 97 % similarity to P. alvei (AUG6), the isolate was designated as P. alvei AN5. An antimicrobial compound was extracted from P. alvei AN5-pelleted cells using 95 % methanol and was then lyophilized. Precipitates were re-suspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), producing an antimicrobial crude extract (ACE). The ACE showed antimicrobial activity against Salmonella enteritidis ATCC 13076, Escherichia coli ATCC 29522, Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579 and Lactobacillus plantarum ATCC 8014. By using SP-Sepharose cation exchange chromatography, Sephadex G-25 gel filtration and Tricine SDS-PAGE, the ACE was purified, which produced a ~2-kDa active band. SDS-PAGE and infrared (IR) spectroscopy indicated the proteinaceous nature of the antimicrobial compound in the ACE, and liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy and de novo sequencing using an automatic, Q-TOF premier system detected a peptide with the amino acid sequence F-C-K-S-L-P-L-P-L-S-V-K (1,330.7789 Da). This novel peptide was designated as AN5-2. The antimicrobial peptide exhibited stability from pH 3 to 12 and maintained its activity after being heated to 90 degrees C. It also remained active after incubation with denaturants (urea, SDS and EDTA).
TI  - Probiotic potential of Lactobacillus spp. isolated from Brazilian regional ovine  cheese.
AB  - Twelve Lactobacillus isolates from Brazilian starter-free ovine cheeses were evaluated for their probiotic potential. The strains were identified by 16S rDNA sequencing as Lactobacillus plantarum (7), Lb. brevis (2), Lb. casei (2) and Lb. parabuchneri (1). All strains showed variable resistance to gastric juices and relative tolerance to pancreatin and bile salts. Only five strains of Lb. plantarum could not deconjugate the sodium salt of taurodeoxycholic acid. Autoaggregation ability after 24 h was above 50% and hydrophobicity was higher than 60% for most strains. All lactobacilli could inhibit linolenic acid oxidation, except Lb. parabuchneri strain, whereas none of them could scavenge DPPH radical. beta-Galactosidase activity ranged from 47.7 to 2503 Miller units. Inhibition of food pathogens Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium was demonstrated and the production of organic acids could be associated with this effect. The Lactobacillus strains from Brazilian regional ovine cheese showed interesting functional characteristics, mainly the strains Lb. brevis SM-B and Lb. plantarum SM-I. Both presented high acid tolerance. In addition, Lb. brevis SM-B also displayed remarkable antioxidant activity and Lb. plantarum SM-I was the highest beta-galactosidase producer, exhibited high autoaggregation and hydrophobicity properties.
TI  - Investigation of antibacterial, acid and bile tolerance properties of lactobacilli isolated from Koozeh cheese.
AB  - Lactobacillus strains are a major part of the probiotics, microflora of the intestine and of fermented dairy products, and are found in a variety of environments. The aim of this study was to find out the ability of bile and acid tolerance and antibacterial properties of the twenty eight isolates of three group lactobacilli namely Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus delbruki. For this purpose Twenty eight different Lactobacillus strains that isolated from Koozeh cheese as a traditional cheese were screened. The acid tolerance test was studied under pH 2.0 and 3.0 with 7.5 as control. The cell count for the acid tolerance test was obtained at an interval of 0, 1, 2 and 3 hours respectively and was pour plated on Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe (MRS) agar to be incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 hours. All cells were selected for bile tolerance test in MRS broth containing bile concentrations of 0% as control and 0.3% as test. Then cell counts were enumerated after 24 hours of incubation on MRS agar. Results showed twenty seven isolates did not have ability to tolerate acid and bile salts and antimicrobial activity against four indicator bacteria included Eshirichia coli, Listeria monocytogenesis, bacillus cereus, Salmonella entritidis. Only one Isolate namely Lactobacillus casei could tolerate acid and bile salt and had antibacterial activity against of L. monocytogenesis. Therefore we can consider this strain as a native probiotic but extra examinations was required.
TI  - Antimicrobial and Safety Properties of Lactobacilli Isolated from two Cameroonian Traditional Fermented Foods.
AB  - Twenty-one Lactobacillus isolates from "Sha'a" (a maize - based fermented beverage) and "Kossam" (traditionally fermented cow milk) were selected in accordance with their antagonistic activities and tested for their bacteriocinogenic potential as well as safety properties. These isolates were preliminarily identified as Lactobacillus plantarum (62%), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (24%), Lactobacillus fermentum (10%) and Lactobacillus coprophilus (4%) based on phenotypic characteristics and rep-PCR genomic fingerprinting. Twelve (57.1%) out of the 21 strains tested were found to be bacteriocin producers, as revealed by the sensitivity of their antimicrobial substances to proteolytic enzymes (Trypsin, Proteinase K) and inhibition of other Lactobacillus spp. These bacteriocinogenic strains showed no positive haemolytic and gelatinase activities and proved to be sensitive to penicillin G, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and doxycyclin, but resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. The bacteriocins showed a broad inhibitory activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, several of which are classified as especially dangerous by the World Health Organization, as well as Multidrug-resistant strains. These include Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovare Typhi, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Shigella flexneri. These Lactobacillus strains are promising candidates for use as protective cultures in food fermentation.
TI  - Partial characterization of bacteriocins produced by two Lactobacilus strains with probiotic properties.
AB  - The probiotic characteristics of Lactobacillus brevis BG18 and Lb. plantarum BG33, isolated from traditional Turkish Tulum cheese were assessed. These two bacteriocinproducer strains exhibited good probiotic characteristics such as resistance in media containing 0.3% bile salt, pepsin (3 mg mL(-)(1)), and pancreatine (1 mg mL(-)(1)) as well as acid resistance at pH 2. They were also adhered to Caco-2 epithelial cells in a manner comparable to Escherichia coli LMG3083 (ETEC) and Salmonella Typhimurium SL1344. The strains produced a heat-stable antimicrobial compound that was shown to be proteinaceous in nature, and therefore, referred to as bacteriocins. The bacteriocins were able to inhibit growth of a number grampositive bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium botulinum, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. Tricine-SDS-PAGE of the active fraction resulted in single bands with estimated molecular masses of 2.5 kDA and 2.7 kDA for Lb. brevis BG18 and Lb. plantarum BG33 bacteriocins, respectively.
TI  - Inhibitory spectra and modes of antimicrobial action of gallotannins from mango kernels (Mangifera indica L.).
AB  - This study investigated the antimicrobial activities and modes of action of penta-, hexa-, hepta-, octa-, nona-, and deca-O-galloylglucose (gallotannins) isolated from mango kernels. The MICs and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) against food-borne bacteria and fungi were determined using a critical dilution assay. Gram-positive bacteria were generally more susceptible to gallotannins than were Gram-negative bacteria. The MICs of gallotannins against Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium botulinum, Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus were 0.2 g liter(-1) or less; enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica were inhibited by 0.5 to 1 g liter(-1), and lactic acid bacteria were resistant. The use of lipopolysaccharide mutants of S. enterica indicated that the outer membrane confers resistance toward gallotannins. Supplementation of LB medium with iron eliminated the inhibitory activity of gallotannins against Staphylococcus aureus, and siderophore-deficient mutants of S. enterica were less resistant toward gallotannins than was the wild-type strain. Hepta-O-galloylglucose sensitized Lactobacillus plantarum TMW1.460 to hop extract, indicating inactivation of hop resistance mechanisms, e.g., the multidrug resistance (MDR) transporter HorA. Carbohydrate metabolism of Lactococcus lactis MG1363, a conditionally respiring organism, was influenced by hepta-O-galloylglucose when grown under aerobic conditions and in the presence of heme but not under anaerobic conditions, indicating that gallotannins influence the respiratory chain. In conclusion, the inhibitory activities of gallotannins are attributable to their strong affinity for iron and likely additionally relate to the inactivation of membrane-bound proteins.
TI  - Analysis of bacterial communities of traditional fermented West African cereal foods using culture independent methods.
AB  - In this study, the microbial composition of kunu-zaki and ogi, two popular foods  in Nigeria produced after natural, uncontrolled fermentation of cereals, was assessed by culture-independent molecular profiling methods. In particular, PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and construction of 16S rRNA gene clone libraries revealed the presence of diverse bacterial communities. DNA sequencing of the highly variable V3 region of the 16S rRNA genes obtained from PCR-DGGE fingerprints identified species related to Weissella confusa, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus amylolyticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Bacillus spp. and Lactococcus lactis spp lactis from food samples obtained from northern and southern geographical locations. A more comprehensive analysis of 272 full-length 16S rRNA gene inserts revealed that 70% of them were assigned to the Lactobacillaceae family and 19% to the Streptococcaceae family. Interestingly, sequences associated with a particular food type were also identified. For example, L. plantarum, L. pantheris and L. vaccinostercus were found in ogi but not in kunu-zaki while W. confusa, Streptococcus lutetiensis and Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus were found in kunu-zaki but not in ogi. Phylotypes corresponding to potentially pathogenic bacteria, such as Clostridium perfringens and Bacillus cereus were also detected highlighting the need for controlled fermentation processes.
TI  - Probiotic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and Taiwanese pickled cabbage.
AB  - This study assessed potential probiotic Lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and from Taiwanese pickled cabbage for their possible use in probiotic fermented foods by evaluating their (i) in vitro adhesive ability, resistance to biotic stress, resistance to pathogenic bacteria, and production of beta-galactosidase; (ii) milk technological properties; and (iii) in vivo adhesive ability, intestinal survival and microbial changes during and after treatment. Five Lactobacillus isolates identified as Lactobacillus reuteri F03, Lactobacillus paracasei F08, Lactobacillus rhamnosus F14, Lactobacillus plantarum C06, and Lactobacillus acidophilus C11 that showed resistance to gastric juice and bile salts were selected for further evaluation of their probiotic properties. All the strains demonstrated the ability to adhere to Caco-2 cells, particularly, strain L. plantarum C06 and L. reuteri F03 showed satisfactory abilities, which were similar to that of the reference strain L. rhamnosus GG. The strains L. paracasei F08 and L. acidophilus C11 had the highest beta-galactosidase activity. Most of the strains were resistant to aminoglycosides and vancomycin but sensitive to ampicillin, erythromycin, and penicillin. All the 5 strains elicited antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus) and -negative (Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica) pathogens. Moreover, the strains L. reuteri F03, L. paracasei F08, and L. plantarum C06 could grow rapidly in milk without nutrient supplementation and reached 10(8) cfu/mL after 24 h of fermentation at 37 degrees C. The viable cell counts of the 3 strains remained above 10(7) cfu/mL after 21 d of storage at 4 degrees C. In the animal feeding trial, the number of intestinal lactobacilli increased significantly after administration of milk fermented with the 3 strains, and the counts of fecal coliforms and Clostridium perfringens were markedly reduced. Lactobacillus strains could also survive in the ileal intestinal tissue of the treated rats. Technologically interesting Lactobacillus isolates may be used in the future as probiotic starter cultures for manufacturing novel fermented foods.
TI  - Bacterial species associated with traditional starter cultures used for fermented bamboo shoot production in Manipur state of India.
AB  - Soidon is a non-salted acidic fermented food prepared from the succulent bamboo shoot tip of Schizostachyum capitatum Munro by using a traditional liquid starter called "soidon mahi" in Manipur state of India. In this study, 163 bacterial isolates associated with this starter samples were identified and their population distribution was investigated by amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA), 16S rDNA sequencing and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. This acidic starter (pH 4.5+/-0.15) was dominated by a characteristic association of Bacillus and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) together. The population distribution of dominant species were Bacillus subtilis 29.3%, Bacillus cereus 35.7%, Bacillus pumilus 2.6%, Lactobacillus brevis 9.6%, Lactobacillus plantarum 5.1%, Carnobacterium sp. 11.9%, Enterococcus faecium 1.2% and Pseudomonas fluorescens 4.6%. Alarming population load (10(6)-10(7)cfu/ml) of B. cereus in 87% of starter samples studied should raise concern regarding biosafety of soidon consumption. PCR amplification of 16S-23S rDNA intergenic transcribed spacer (ITS) region and ITS-RFLP profiles revealed a high diversity with eight subgroups in B. subtilis, five subgroups in B. cereus and three subgroups in L. brevis isolates. The most abundant B. subtilis subgroup IB.1 distributed in most of the samples showed very less clonal variability during RAPD analysis. The molecular methods used in this study identified the dominant strains of Bacillus and LAB distributed in most of the starter samples. These dominant strains of B. subtilis, L. brevis and L. plantarum would allow for developing a defined starter culture for the production of quality soidon.
TI  - Development of starter culture for improved processing of Lafun, an African fermented cassava food product.
AB  - AIMS: To select appropriate micro-organisms to be used as starter culture for reliable and reproducible fermentation of Lafun. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 22 cultures consisting of yeast, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and Bacillus cereus strains predominant in traditionally fermented cassava during Lafun processing were tested as potential starter cultures. In an initial screening, Saccharomyces cerevisiae 2Y48P22, Lactobacillus fermentum 2L48P21, Lactobacillus plantarum 1L48P35 and B. cereus 2B24P31 were found to be the most promising of the cultures and were subsequently tested in different combinations as mixed starter cultures to ferment submerged cassava roots. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, inoculated singly or combined with B. cereus, gave the softest cassava root after 48 h of fermentation according to determination of compression profile and stress at fracture. Overall, sensory quality testing showed that Lafun obtained from S. cerevisiae-fermented cassava gave the most preferred stiff porridge. Saccharomyces cerevisiae 2Y48P22 showed pectinase production in a model system. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that S. cerevisiae 2Y48P22 is the most efficient organism for cassava softening during the fermentation. Therefore, it could be combined with LAB and used as starter for Lafun processing. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Starter cultures are made available for controlled fermentation of Lafun.
TI  - The microbiota of Lafun, an African traditional cassava food product.
AB  - Lafun is a fermented cassava food product consumed in parts of West Africa. In the present work the microorganisms (aerobic bacteria (AB), lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and yeasts) associated with the fermentation of Lafun under traditional conditions have for the first time been studied using a combination of pheno- and genotypic methods. During Lafun fermentation the AB count ranged from 6-7 log(10) CFU/g at the beginning to 9 log(10) CFU/g at the end. Similarly, the number of LAB increased from 5 log(10) CFU/g to 9 log(10) CFU/g during the process while the yeast load increased from 3 log(10) CFU/g at the onset of the fermentation to 5-6 log(10) CFU/g at the end of the fermentation. A total of 168 isolates (31 AB, 88 LAB, and 49 yeasts) were isolated and identified by means of phenotypic tests, PCR-based methods and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The aerobic bacteria were mostly identified as belonging to the Bacillus cereus group (71%). The B. cereus isolates lacked the genetic determinant specific for cereulide producers but harboured several genes encoding the heat-labile toxins hemolysin BL and nonhemolytic enterotoxin as detected by PCR. The other aerobic bacteria isolated were Gram negative and identified as Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pantoea agglomerans. The dominant LAB were identified as Lactobacillus fermentum (42% of LAB isolates) followed by Lactobacillus plantarum (30%) and Weissella confusa (18%). Seven isolates remained unidentified and constitute probably a novel LAB species. The predominant yeast species associated with Lafun fermentation were Saccharomyces cerevisiae (22% of yeast isolates), Pichia scutulata (20%), Kluyveromyces marxianus (18%), Hanseniaspora guilliermondii (12%), Pichia rhodanensis (8%) and Candida glabrata (8%) as well as Pichia kudriavzevii, Candida tropicalis and Trichosporon asahii at lower incidence (<5% each).
TI  - Characterization and purification of a new bacteriocin with a broad inhibitory spectrum produced by Lactobacillus plantarum lp 31 strain isolated from dry-fermented sausage.
AB  - AIMS: Characterization and purification of a new bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus plantarum LP 31 strain, isolated from Argentinian dry-fermented sausage. METHODS AND RESULTS: Lactobacillus plantarum LP 31 strain produces an antimicrobial compound that inhibits the growth of food-borne pathogenic bacteria. It was inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, was stable to heat and catalase and exhibited maximum activity in the pH range from 5.0 to 6.0. Consequently, it was characterized as a bacteriocin. It was purified by RP (reverse-phase) solid-phase extraction, gel filtration chromatography and RP-HPLC. Plantaricin produced by Lact. plantarum LP 31 is a peptide with a molecular weight of 1558.85 Da as determined by Maldi-Tof mass spectrometry and contains 14 amino acid residues. It was shown to have a bactericidal effect against Pseudomonas sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and Listeria monocytogenes. CONCLUSIONS: The bacteriocin produced by Lact. plantarum LP 31 may be considered as a new plantaricin according to its low molecular weight and particular amino acid composition. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: In view of the interesting inhibitory spectrum of this bacteriocin and because of its good technological properties (resistance to heat and activity at acidic pH), this bacteriocin has potential applications as a biopreservative to prevent the growth of food-borne pathogens and food spoilage bacteria in certain food products.
TI  - Survival of Bacillus cereus vegetative cells during Spanish-style fermentation of conservolea green olives.
AB  - The aim of this research was to investigate the survival of artificially inoculated Bacillus cereus during Spanish-style green olive fermentation. Olives were initially treated with lye and subjected to different fermentation procedures including (i) heat shock (85 degrees C for 10 min) and inoculation with Lactobacillus plantarum ACA-DC 287, (ii) heat shock and inoculation with L. plantarum ACA-DC 146, (iii) heat shock and inoculation with Lactobacillus pentosus isolated during previous studies, and (iv) fermentation by indigenous flora (control process). Microbial growth and survival, pH, titratable acidity, and organic acid evolution were monitored. Inactivation of B. cereus was observed during all processes. The pathogen population declined during all fermentations, but a tailing effect was observed in the brines when the population reached 2 log CFU/ml, at which point the pathogen does not pose a risk to human health. The rate of inactivation was higher in heat-shocked inoculated olives (mean of -2.21 log CFU/day) compared with control olives (-1.26 log/day), indicating an advantage of heat shock and inoculation over spontaneous fermentation. The production of organic acids (primarily lactic acid) during fermentation seemed to be the main factor that determined the behavior of the pathogen under stress conditions prevailing in the brine. Principal components analysis was useful for distinguishing among the different fermentation processes on the basis of the relevant organic acid profile.
TI  - Bacteriocin-producing Lactobacillus strains isolated from poto poto, a Congolese  fermented maize product, and genetic fingerprinting of their plantaricin operons.
AB  - Thirty one bacteriocin-producing Lactobacillus isolates were identified among 135 lactobacilli isolated from the Congolese fermented maize product poto poto, during the preparation and from the finished product. Using species-specific PCR and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, 28 and 3 isolates were identified as L. plantarum and L. fermentum, respectively. Cluster analysis of RAPD-PCR fingerprints revealed two main groups (G1 and G2) plus the L. fermentum isolate C4-13. Group G1 contained 23 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 74.5%, and could be divided in two subgroups (G1-1, G1-2) each with several branches, plus the L. plantarum isolate C11. Group G2 contained 8 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 86%, with two main branches. Using PCR amplification with specific primers, several genes of the plantaricin cluster found in L. plantarum C11 were identified in the isolates. The number of genes that were detected varied between the strains. The L. fermentum isolate EC11 also contained the plnDEFG genes. PCR amplification of DNA from isolates with primers directed to the upstream and downstream region of the plantaricin cluster generated an amplicon identical to that obtained with DNA from the control strain L. plantarum WCFS1. Amplification products from the positive strains were used for restriction analysis with HindIII, EcoRI and KpnI in separate reactions. Cluster analysis of restriction profiles revealed high similarities for EcoRI and HindII digest profiles, and an identical profile for all KpnI digests. The L. fermentum EC11 isolate clustered with L. plantarum strains in a group with a high correlation coefficient. The results suggest a low degree of diversity in the plantarincin gene cluster. However, other strains that tested positive for individual plantaricin genes may present great heterogeneity in the plantaricin operons. Because of their broad spectra of inhibition (including Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Enterobacter aerogenes, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Enterococcus faecalis), isolates from the present study could be used to improve the safety and storage stability of poto poto.
TI  - Microbial population present in fermented beverage 'cauim' produced by Brazilian  Amerindians.
AB  - The Tapirape Amerindians of the Tapi'itawa tribe produce several fermented foods  and beverages among them the beverage called 'cauim'. This beverage is the main staple food for infants until two years old and their parents. For producing the beverage, several substrates are used, such as: cassava, rice, corn, maize and peanuts. The fermentation using mainly cassava was accomplished and samples were collected for chemical and microbiological analysis. A progressive acidification during the fermentation was observed and pH value decreased from 5.5 to 3.4. Lactic acid was the most important fermentation metabolite found but significant amounts of ethanol and acetic acid were also observed. The microbial load was high at the beginning of the fermentation, bacterial population was about 6.8 log cfu/ml and yeast population was 3.7 log cfu/ml. A total of 355 bacteria were isolated and identified. All the isolates were grouped into Gram-negative (3.5%), Gram-positive non-sporulating (78%) and Gram-positive sporulating bacteria (18.5%). Lactic acid bacteria increased from the beginning of fermentation and became the dominant microorganism throughout the fermentation. Species of bacteria were varied and they were found to be Lactobacillus pentosus, L. plantarum, Corynebacterium xerosis, C. amylocolatum, C. vitarumen, Bacillus cereus, B. licheniformis, B. pumilus, B. circulans and Paenibacillus macerans. The species L. pentosus and L. plantarum were the dominant bacteria and were present in all the periods of evaluation of the samples.
TI  - Antimicrobial and cytotoxic knotwood extracts and related pure compounds and their effects on food-associated microorganisms.
AB  - Knotwood or bark extracts prepared from 30 species of hard and soft wood trees as well as selected pure compounds (lignans, stilbenes and flavonoids) were assayed for their antimicrobial activity against a battery of both gram positive and negative bacteria, yeasts, and filamentous fungi (Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Lactobacillus plantarum, Escherichia coli, Salmonella infantis, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Aspergillus fumigatus and Penicillium brevicompactum). By far the most consistent antibacterial and antifungal properties were associated with extracts of Pinus species. These extracts showed also cytotoxicity against a mouse hepatoma cell line. Both antimicrobial and cytotoxic properties correlated with the stilbene content of the extracts. Purified stilbenes showed the most consistent antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities, while purified lignans had marginal effects, only. The results suggest that stilbenes account both for the antimicrobial and cytotoxic properties of Pinus knotwood extracts.
TI  - Glucan and fructan production by sourdough Weissella cibaria and Lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  - After a large screening on sourdough lactic acid bacteria, exopolysaccharide (EPS)-forming strains of Weissella cibaria, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Pediococcus pentosaceus were selected. After 6 days of incubation at 30 degrees C, the synthesis of EPS in MRS-based broth ranged from 5.54 to 7.88 mg mL-1. EPS had an apparent molecular mass of ca. 104 Da. As shown by carbohydrate consumption, the synthesis of EPS was found from sucrose only. Two types of homopolysaccharides were synthesized: glucans simultaneously with growth and fructans after 1 day of incubation. Two protein bands of ca. 180-200 kDa were in situ detected on SDS-PAGE gels incubated with sucrose. PCR products of ca. 220 bp were found for L. plantarum PL9 (100% of identity to putative priming glycosyltransferase of L. plantarum WCFS1) and W. cibaria WC4 (80% of identity to putative glycosyltransferase, epsD, of Bacillus cereus G9241) by using hybrid primers for the priming gtf genes. Degenerated primers DexreuR and DexreuV showed a unique PCR product, and the predicted amino acid sequences were identical for W. cibaria WC4 and L. plantarum PL9. The sequence had similarity with polysaccharide biosynthesis glycosyltransferases. W. cibaria WC4 or L. plantarum LP9 synthesized ca. 2.5 g kg-1 EPS during sourdough fermentation with sucrose added. Compared to the sourdough started with an EPS-negative strain, the sourdough started with W. cibaria WC4 or L. plantarum LP9 increased the viscosity, and the resulting bread had higher specific volume and lower firmness. The synthesis of EPS by selected sourdough lactic acid bacteria could be considered as a useful tool to replace the additives for improving the textural properties of baked goods.
TI  - Isolation of bacteriocinogenic Lactobacillus plantarum strains from ben saalga, a traditional fermented gruel from Burkina Faso.
AB  - A collection of lactic acid bacteria isolated from ben saalga, a traditional fermented gruel from Burkina Faso, was screened for bacteriocin production. Seven isolates were selected for their broad antimicrobial spectra, which overall included strains of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus licheniformis, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria innocua, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. Cluster analysis of RAPD-PCR patterns revealed that six of the isolates represent different strains. The six selected strains were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum by 16S rDNA sequencing, species-specific PCR and multiplex PCR of the recA gene. PCR amplification revealed the presence of genes of the plantaricin cluster described in L. plantarum C11. Among them, strain 5.2.2 carried the largest number of genes from this cluster.
TI  - Lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. From the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. RESULTS: A novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. Each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called cscA, cscB, cscC and cscD. Clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus sakei, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria innocua, Listeria monocytogenes, Lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and Bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of L. lactis ssp cremoris, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Lactobacillius brevis, Oenococcus oeni, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Bacillus thuringiensis. These genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the Lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. All encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the Sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel WxL domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. Transcriptome analysis in L. plantarum shows that the cscA-D genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. Many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpA-mutant derivative of L. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. This is supported by the presence of predicted CRE-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated cscA-D gene clusters. CONCLUSION: We propose that the CscA, CscB, CscC and CscD proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. Primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria and yeasts associated with spontaneous fermentations during  the production of sour cassava starch in Brazil.
AB  - Sour cassava starch is a traditional fermented food used in the preparation of fried foods and baked goods such as traditional cheese breads in Brazil. Thirty samples of sour cassava starch were collected from two factories in the state of Minas Gerais. The samples were examined for the presence of lactic acid bacteria, yeasts, mesophilic microorganisms, Bacillus cereus and faecal coliforms. Lactic acid bacteria and yeasts isolates were identified by biochemical tests, and the identities were confirmed by molecular methods. Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus fermentum were the prevalent lactic acid bacteria in product from both factories, at numbers between 6.0 and 9.0 log cfu g(-)(1). Lactobacillus perolans and Lactobacillus brevis were minor fractions of the population. Galactomyces geothricum and Issatchenkia sp. were the prevalent yeasts at numbers of 5.0 log cfu g(-)(1). A species similar to Candida ethanolica was frequently isolated from one factory. Mesophilic bacteria and amylolytic microorganisms were recovered in high numbers at all stages of the fermentation. B. cereus was found at low numbers in product at both factories. The spontaneous fermentations associated with the production of sour cassava starch involve a few species of lactic acid bacteria at high numbers and a variety of yeasts at relatively low numbers.
TI  - The assessment of biological activities associated with the major constituents of the methanol extract of 'wild carrot' (Daucus carota L) seeds.
AB  - Daucus carota L. (Family: Apiaceae alt. Umbelliferae), commonly known as 'wild carrot' or 'Queen Anne's-lace,' is an ecologically invasive erect biennial naturalized to Scotland. The ethnobotanical uses of this species include applications in the treatment of cough, diarrhea, dysentery, cancer, malaria and tumors, and as an antiseptic, abortifacient, aphrodisiac, carminative, stimulant, stomachic and tonic. The major constituents isolated from the methanol extract of D. carota seeds by reversed-phase preparative high performance chromatography were luteolin, luteolin 3'-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and luteolin 4'-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, three flavones. The constituents were assessed for their antibacterial and free radical scavenging activities, as well as toxicity towards brine shrimp. Among these three flavones, luteolin showed the highest degree of free radical scavenging activity (RC50 = 4.3 x 10(-4) mg/mL) in the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay. Both luteolin and its 4'-O-glucoside demonstrated bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration [MIC] = 5.0 x 10(-2) - 1.0 x 10(-1) mg/mL). Luteolin also demonstrated antibactericidal activity against Bacillus cereus and Citrobacter freundii (MIC = 5.0 x 10(-2) mg/mL). Luteolin 3'-O-glucoside showed bactericidal activity against Bacillus cereus and Lactobacillus plantarum (MIC = 2.5 x 10(-1) mg/mL and 5 x 10(-1) mg/ mL, respectively). In the brine shrimp lethality assay, the LD50 value of luteolin was 5.3 x 10(-2) mg/mL, and that of its 3'-O-glucoside and 4'-O-glucoside were > 1.0 mg/mL.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Tenerife cheese: initial characterization of plantaricin TF711, a bacteriocin-like substance produced by Lactobacillus plantarum TF711.
AB  - AIMS: The screening and initial characterization of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from raw Tenerife goats' cheese with possible application as biopreservatives or ripening accelerators for Tenerife cheese. METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred and eighty LAB of the genera Lactobacillus (95), Leuconostoc (64) and Lactococcus (21) isolated from raw Tenerife goats' cheese were screened for the production of antimicrobial substances. Lactobacillus plantarum TF711, which had the broadest spectrum of antimicrobial activity, was selected for further characterization. The antimicrobial compound was determined as a proteinaceous substance, as it was sensitive to proteases. The bacteriocin-like substance, which we called plantaricin TF711, was active against the Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus cereus, Clostridium sporogenes and Staphylococcus aureus; and against the Enterobacteriaceae Shigella sonnei and Klebsiella pneumoniae. It was stable to heat and to treatment with surfactants and organic solvents. Highest antimicrobial activity was found between pH 1 and 9. Plantaricin TF711 exhibited primary metabolite kinetics, a bacteriostatic mode of action and a molecular mass of c. 2.5 kDa as determined by tricine SDS-PAGE. CONCLUSIONS: Lact. plantarum TF711 produces a low molecular mass bacteriocin-like compound with a wide spectrum of activity and interesting technological properties (thermostability, good pH stability and stability against surfactants and organic solvents). SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Plantaricin TF711 was found to have potential for use as a biopreservative in the food industry.
TI  - A rapid biosensor for viable B. anthracis spores.
AB  - A simple membrane-strip-based biosensor assay has been combined with a nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) reaction for rapid (4 h) detection of a small number (ten) of viable B. anthracis spores. The biosensor is based on identification of a unique mRNA sequence from one of the anthrax toxin genes, the protective antigen ( pag), encoded on the toxin plasmid, pXO1, and thus provides high specificity toward B. anthracis. Previously, the anthrax toxins activator ( atxA) mRNA had been used in our laboratory for the development of a biosensor for the detection of a single B. anthracis spore within 12 h. Changing the target sequence to the pag mRNA provided the ability to shorten the overall assay time significantly. The vaccine strain of B. anthracis (Sterne strain) was used in all experiments. A 500-microL sample containing as few as ten spores was mixed with 500 microL growth medium and incubated for 30 min for spore germination and mRNA production. Thus, only spores that are viable were detected. Subsequently, RNA was extracted from lysed cells, selectively amplified using NASBA, and rapidly identified by the biosensor. While the biosensor assay requires only 15 min assay time, the overall process takes 4 h for detection of ten viable B. anthracis spores, and is shortened significantly if more spores are present. The biosensor is based on an oligonucleotide sandwich-hybridization assay format. It uses a membrane flow-through system with an immobilized DNA probe that hybridizes with the target sequence. Signal amplification is provided when the target sequence hybridizes to a second DNA probe that has been coupled to liposomes encapsulating the dye sulforhodamine B. The amount of liposomes captured in the detection zone can be read visually or quantified with a hand-held reflectometer. The biosensor can detect as little as 1 fmol target mRNA (1 nmol L(-1)). Specificity analysis revealed no cross-reactivity with 11 organisms tested, among them closely related species such as B. cereus, B. megaterium, B. subtilis, B. thuringiensis, Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Chlostridium butyricum. Also, no false positive signals were obtained from nonviable spores. We suggest that this inexpensive biosensor is a viable option for rapid, on-site analysis providing highly specific data on the presence of viable B. anthracis spores.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of commercial annatto extracts against selected pathogenic, lactic acid, and spoilage microorganisms.
AB  - Annatto preparations are used to impart distinctive flavor and color to foods and are a primary colorant in dairy foods such as cheese and butter. There are several reports indicating that certain fractions of the annatto plant have biological activities against microorganisms of significance in food fermentation, food preservation, and human health. However, little is reported describing the nature of the antimicrobial compound(s) or their potential presence in commercial annatto colorant preparations. This study was conducted to determine whether commonly available annatto extracts are capable of influencing the outgrowth of selected lactic acid, spoilage, and pathogenic microorganisms. Disk diffusion and tube macrodilution techniques were used to determine the MICs and MBCs of double-strength water-soluble annatto extracts. Standard antibiotic disks were used as controls for the disk diffusion assay. The results demonstrate that annatto has an inhibitory effect on Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, and Staphylococcus aureus, with MICs of 0.08, 0.31, and 0.16% (vol/vol) and diameters of inhibition of 9 to 10, 12 to 13, and 15 to 16 mm, respectively. A concentration of 0.63% (vol/vol) inhibited the growth of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, Lactococcus lactis, and Paenibacillus polymyxa. The MICs for Listeria monocytogenes and Enterococcus durans were 1.25 and 2.5% (vol/vol), respectively. No activity was detected against Lactobacillus plantarum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, yeasts, or selected gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Rope-producing strains of Bacillus spp. from wheat bread and strategy for their control by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Two types of white wheat bread (high- and low-type loaves) were investigated for  rope spoilage. Thirty of the 56 breads tested developed rope spoilage within 5 days; the high-type loaves were affected by rope spoilage more than the low-type loaves. Sixty-one Bacillus strains were isolated from ropy breads and were characterized on the basis of their phenotypic and genotypic traits. All of the isolates were identified as Bacillus subtilis by biochemical tests, but molecular assays (randomly amplified polymorphic DNA PCR assay, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis, and sequencing of the V3 region of 16S ribosomal DNA) revealed greater Bacillus species variety in ropy breads. In fact, besides strains of B. subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus cereus, and isolates of Bacillus clausii and Bacillus firmus were also identified. All of the ropy Bacillus isolates exhibited amylase activity, whereas only 32.4% of these isolates were able to produce ropiness in bread slices after treatment at 96 degrees C for 10 min. Strains of lactic acid bacteria previously isolated from sourdough were first selected for antirope activity on bread slices and then used as starters for bread-making experiments. Prevention of growth of approximately 10(4) rope-producing B. subtilis G1 spores per cm(2) on bread slices for more than 15 days was observed when heat-treated cultures of Lactobacillus plantarum E5 and Leuconostoc mesenteroides A27 were added. Growth of B. subtilis G1 occurred after 7 days in breads started with Saccharomyces cerevisiae T22, L. plantarum E5, and L. mesenteroides A27.
TI  - Characterization of the genetic locus responsible for the production of ABP-118,  a novel bacteriocin produced by the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salivarius UCC118.
AB  - ABP-118, a small heat-stable bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salivarius UCC118, a strain isolated from the ileal-caecal region of the human gastrointestinal tract, was purified to homogeneity. Using reverse genetics, a DNA fragment specifying part of ABP-118 was identified on a 10769 bp chromosomal region. Analysis of this region revealed that ABP-118 was a Class IIb two-peptide bacteriocin composed of Abp118alpha, which exhibited the antimicrobial activity, and Abp118beta, which enhanced the antimicrobial activity. The gene conferring strain UCC118 immunity to the action of ABP-118, abpIM, was identified downstream of the abp118beta gene. Located further downstream of abp118beta, several ORFs were identified whose deduced proteins resembled those of proteins involved in bacteriocin regulation and secretion. Heterologous expression of ABP-118 was achieved in Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactococcus lactis and Bacillus cereus. In addition, the abp118 locus encoded an inducing peptide, AbpIP, which was shown to play a role in the regulation of ABP-118 production. This novel bacteriocin is, to the authors' knowledge, the first to be isolated from a known human probiotic bacterium and to be characterized at the genetic level.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of chitosans and chitosan oligomers with different molecular weights.
AB  - Antibacterial activities of six chitosans and six chitosan oligomers with different molecular weights (Mws) were examined against four gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Salmonella typhimurium, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus) and seven gram-positive bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus megaterium, B. cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus plantarum, L. brevis, and L. bulgaricus). Chitosans showed higher antibacterial activities than chitosan oligomers and markedly inhibited growth of most bacteria tested although inhibitory effects differed with Mws of chitosan and the particular bacterium. Chitosan generally showed stronger bactericidal effects with gram-positive bacteria than gram-negative bacteria in the presence of 0.1% chitosan. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of chitosans ranged from 0.05% to >0.1% depending on the bacteria and Mws of chitosan. As a chitosan solvent, 1% acetic acid was effective in inhibiting the growth of most of the bacteria tested except for lactic acid bacteria that were more effectively suppressed with 1% lactic or formic acids. Antibacterial activity of chitosan was inversely affected by pH (pH 4.5-5.9 range tested), with higher activity at lower pH value.
TI  - Inhibition of Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579 by plantaricin UG1 in vitro and in food.
AB  - The inhibition of Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579 viable growth by Lactobacillus plantarum UG1 bacteriocin (plantaricin UG1) in vitro and in food (pasteurized milk and minced meat) was studied. The inhibitory effect against B. cereus food-borne pathogen noticed in this study was due to plantaricin UG1, but not due to lactic acid produced by the L. plantarum UG1 culture. Plataricin UG1 negative clone did not affect viable growth of B. cereus in both broth and meat or pasteurized milk. The inhibitory effect of L. plantarum UG1 and its bacteriocion was apparently more in liquid systems (BHI broth & pasteurized milk) than in minced meat. The inhibitory effect of plantaricin UG1 against B. cereus was dependent on its concentration. The 22880 AU/ml concentration appeared to be an ideal preservative against B. cereus ATCC 14579 in liquid systems.
TI  - Production of bacteriocin-like metabolites by lactic acid cultures isolated from  sucuk samples.
AB  - A total of 51 sucuk samples, obtained from different regions of Turkey, were examined for lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains producing putative bacteriocin-like metabolites. For detection of antagonistic activity, agar spot and well diffusion assay tests were used. Lactobacillus sake Lb790, Listeria monocytogenes Li6, Staphylococcus aureus St44 and Escherichia coli NRRL B-3704 were used as indicator organisms. Strains having antimicrobial activity were also tested against Clostridium perfringens 4TTK, Clostridium botulinum type A. 7948, Bacillus cereus NRRL B-3711, Micrococcus luteus NRRL B-4376 and Yersinia enterocolitica type 103. 57 of 424 isolates from sucuk samples were putative producers of bacteriocin-like metabolistes and were identified as the following: 19 Lactobacillus plantarum, 4 L. curvatus, 4 Pediococcus pentosaceus, 3 P. acidilactici, 2 L. pentosus, 2 L. sake, 1 L. delbrueckii, 1 L. rhamnosus and 21 unidentified Lactobacillus spp. P. pentosaceus 416, P. acidilactici 413, 419 and 446, L. curvatus 348, L. plantarum 452 and 495, and Lactobacillus spp. 411 strains have the best potential for use as sucuk starter cultures.
TI  - Synergist effect of sucrose fatty acid esters on nisin inhibition of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Nisin in combination with the sucrose fatty acid esters, sucrose palmitate (P-1570 and P-1670) or sucrose stearate (S-1570 and S-1670) was tested against a range of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Initial liquid culture investigation showed that the sugar ester P-1670 resulted in a synergist enhancement of the bacteriostatic activity of nisin against Gram-positive bacteria and not Gram-negative bacteria. Some enhancement of the bactericidal activity of nisin against Listeria monocytogenes was also observed. This increased nisin inhibitory effect was confirmed on solid media using plates with gradients of pH and NaCl. Synergism was observed with all four sucrose fatty acid esters, which enhanced the antimicrobial activity of nisin against several strains of L. monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus (both cells and spores), Lactobacillus plantarum and Staphylococcus aureus. The combination of nisin and the sucrose fatty acid esters showed no inhibition of Gram-negative bacteria (Salmonella enteritidis, Salm. typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa).
TI  - Isolation, purification and partial characterization of plantaricin 423, a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum 423, isolated from sorghum beer, produces a bacteriocin (plantaricin 423) which is inhibitory to several food spoilage bacteria and food-borne pathogens, including Bacillus cereus, Clostridium sporogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria spp. and Staphylococcus spp. Plantaricin 423 is resistant to treatment at 80 degrees C, but loses 50% of its activity after 60 min at 100 degrees C and 75% of its activity after autoclaving (121 degrees C, 15 min). Plantaricin 423 remains active after incubation at pH 1-10 and is inactivated when treated with pepsin, papain, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and Proteinase K. Plantaricin 423 was partially purified and its size estimated at 3.5 kDa, as determined by tricine-SDS-PAGE. The mechanism of activity of plantaricin 423 is weakly bactericidal, as determined against Oenococcus oeni (previously Leuconostoc oenos). High DNA homology was obtained between the plasmid DNA of strain 423 and the pediocin PA-1 operon of Pediococcus acidilactici PAC 1.0, suggesting that plantaricin 423 is plasmid-encoded and related to the pediocin gene cluster.
TI  - Plantaricin LP84, a broad spectrum heat-stable bacteriocin of Lactobacillus plantarum NCIM 2084 produced in a simple glucose broth medium.
AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum NCIM 2084 produced an antibacterial substance when grown  at 40 degrees C for 36 h in a laboratory medium. The antibacterial substance was active against a wide range of bacteria comprising Gram positive and negative foodborne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria. However, related mesophilic lactobacilli were not inhibited, except for L. amylovorus DSM 20531. The antimicrobial activity was observed between late log and stationary growth phases. The antibacterial substance was partially purified through concentration under vacuum, followed by extraction with methanol and acetone (M-A extract). On fractionation of the M-A extract through Sephadex G-25, the activity was present in an eluant volume of 85 to 100 ml (peak I), indicating an apparent molecular mass of between 1 and 5 kDa and the purification attained was 80-fold. The antimicrobial principle was stable to heat (121 degrees C for 20 min) and catalase, but sensitive to trypsin and chymotrypsin, indicating it to be a bacteriocin. The M-A extract exhibited a bactericidal and lytic effect against Bacillus cereus F 4810 and Escherichia coli D 21. The ability of L. plantarum NCIM 2084 to produce an effective bacteriocin in a simple growth medium is of potential interest in its application as a biopreservative in traditional fermented foods.
TI  - Inhibition of microbial growth by ajoene, a sulfur-containing compound derived from garlic.
AB  - Ajoene, a garlic-derived sulfur-containing compound that prevents platelet aggregation, exhibited broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. Growth of gram-positive bacteria, such as Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Mycobacterium smegmatis, and Streptomyces griseus, was inhibited at 5 micrograms of ajoene per ml. Staphylococcus aureus and Lactobacillus plantarum also were inhibited below 20 micrograms of ajoene per ml. For gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Xanthomonas maltophilia, MICs were between 100 and 160 micrograms/ml. Ajoene also inhibited yeast growth at concentrations below 20 micrograms/ml. The microbicidal effect of ajoene on growing cells was observed at slightly higher concentrations than the corresponding MICs. B. cereus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were killed at 30 micrograms of ajoene per ml after 24 h of cultivation when cultivation was started at 10(5) cells per ml. However, the minimal microbicidal concentrations for resting cells were at 10 to 100 times higher concentrations than the corresponding MICs. The disulfide bond in ajoene appears to be necessary for the antimicrobial activity of ajoene, since reduction by cysteine, which reacts with disulfide bonds, abolished its antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Lactobacillus plantarum UG1 isolated from dry sausage:  characterization, production and bactericidal action of plantaricin UG1.
AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum UG1 isolated from dry sausage produced an antimicrobial substance that inhibited other strains of the genera Lactobacillus and Lactococcus, and some foodborne pathogens including Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium sporogenes. This antibacterial substance was inactivated by proteolytic enzymes and showed a bactericidal mode of action. Consequently, it was characterized as a bacteriocin, and was designated plantaricin UG1. This bacteriocin was stable in the pH range 4.5 to 7.0, partially inactivated by amylolytic enzymes and relatively thermostable. It was not affected by organic or lipolytic enzymes. Production of plantaricin UG1 was pH- and temperature-dependant and maximum yields were obtained in MRS broth cultures maintained at initial pH 6.5, and incubated at 25 degrees C to 30 degrees C, in the exponential to the early stationary growth phase of the producer organism. Ultrafiltration studies indicated that plantaricin UG1 has a molecular weight between 3 and 10 KDa. Curing experiments with L. plantarum UG1 resulted in the appearance of variants that lost bacteriocin production ability but were still immune to the bacteriocin. Plantaricin UG1 production appeared to be chromosomal encoded. Sensitive and insensitive Gram-positive bacteria adsorbed plantaricin UG1 irrespective of their susceptibility to it. In contrast, Gram-negative bacteria did not adsorb plantaricin UG1. The bactericidal action of plantaricin UG1 did not depend on the physiological state of the indicator culture and did not cause cell lysis. The resistance of two indicator strains to plantaricin UG1 has been studied.
TI  - Specific antibody-mediated detection of Brochothrix thermosphacta in situ in British fresh sausage.
AB  - A rabbit polyclonal antibody-linked probe was developed which detected 76% of 800 food isolates of the spoilage bacterium Brochothrix thermosphacta when cells were bound to nitrocellulose. In slide cross-reaction tests all six environmental isolates tested were stained but the type strain was not. The antibody did not cross-react with Listeria grayi, L. monocytogenes, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus mutans, Bacillus cereus or B. subtilis. The antibody-linked probe detected Br. thermosphacta in thin sections of British fresh sausage when the viable count was greater than 10(6) g-1. Cells were detected mainly within 1 or 2 mm of the surface on the loose starchy material. They were not detected within muscle blocks or in the centre of the sausage. Such results suggest that growth of this organism occurs close to the surface of the sausage.
TI  - Detection, identification and characterization of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria from retail food products.
AB  - Forty bacteriocin-producing (Bac+) lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from  food samples purchased from retail supermarkets and local farms. Of the 40 Bac+ isolates, 18 were isolated from 85 food samples by enrichment (21% isolation rate) whereas eight were obtained from 63 samples by direct plating (13% isolation rate). By direct plating, Bac+ LAB were detected at levels up to 2.4 x 10(5) cfu/g in ready-to-eat meats. The Bac+ isolates were identified by carbohydrate fermentation patterns, SDS-PAGE protein patterns, and other biochemical characteristics; SDS-PAGE proved invaluable in identifying strains that could not be identified by other means. Differential inhibitory spectra against indicator microorganisms assisted in the identification of 19 unique Bac+ isolates. Bac+ LAB included Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus curvatus, Lb. delbrueckii, Lb. plantarum, Lactococcus lactis, and Pediococcus acidilactici. Lb. curvatus (four strains) and Lc. lactis (nine strains) were the only isolates inhibitory to foodborne pathogens including Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens and Staphylococcus aureus. Some Lc. lactis isolates inhibited as many as nine Gram-positive genera. Lb. curvatus FS47 and FS65 grew to high cell densities and produced bacteriocin at 6 degrees C; however, Lc. lactis FS56 produced greater levels of bacteriocin at lower cell densities. The high incidence of Bac+ LAB detected in retail foods indicates that the public is consuming a wide variety of Bac+ LAB that occur as natural contaminants. These data suggest a greater role for bacteriocins as biopreservatives in food.
TI  - The occurrence and growth of microorganisms during the fermentation of fish sausage.
AB  - Minced fish (mullet) sausage mixes containing added sugar, salt, nitrate, nitrite and spices were fermented (48 h, 30 degrees C) by indigenous flora or by a starter culture (Pediococcus acidilactici) and the microbial ecology and behaviour of various bacteria was monitored. Pediococcus pentosaceus and Lactobacillus plantarum dominated the indigenous fermentation, achieving populations of 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g by 48 h, and decreasing the pH of the mix to 4.5-4.7. Significant growth (10(5)-10(7) cfu/g) of Staphylococcus warneri, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis. Micrococcus varians and Micrococcus luteus also occurred during this fermentation. Less growth was exhibited by Bacillus megaterium and yeasts. Pediococcus acidilactici dominated the fermentation when it was inoculated as a starter culture, but indigenous lactic acid bacteria (P. pentosaceus and L. plantarum) also grew to 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g. The growth of other bacteria and yeasts was restricted during fermentation with starter culture. Inoculated Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella sofia, and Staphylococcus aureus grew to 10(6)-10(7) cfu/g in the sausage mix during indigenous fermentation. Lesser growth occurred for Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Growth of these bacteria was significantly inhibited in sausage mix fermented with P. acidilactici.
TI  - Growth of Bacillus cereus in fermenting tempeh made from various beans and its inhibition by Lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  - Counts of Bacillus cereus reached ca 10(8) cfu/g within 40 h in fermenting unacidified horsebean tempeh and resulted in complete spoilage of the product. In fermenting unacidified pea, chickpea and soybean tempeh, B. cereus counts reached 10(6)-10(7) cfu/g, although the products were not spoiled. Inoculation of these unacidified beans with Lactobacillus plantarum decreased the final count of B. cereus by 2 log units, but had no effect on its growth in unacidified horsebean tempeh and its subsequent spoilage. Acidification of the beans during soaking resulted in a lower rate of B. cereus growth during fermentation. Inoculation of acidified beans with Lact. plantarum resulted in a markedly lower growth rate of B. cereus. In an associative broth culture study, B. cereus was completely inhibited by Lact. plantarum at pH values of about 5.5. Lactobacillus plantarum may be used to control the growth of B. cereus during tempeh production.
TI  - Preincubation time and the use of oxygen indicators in determining the microbiological quality of aseptically packed pea and tomato soup.
AB  - In order to get accurate information about the preincubation time needed for viscous aseptic products, the growth characteristics of three food poisoning organisms Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens and Bacillus cereus in pea soup, and one spoilage organism, Lactobacillus plantarum, in tomato soup, were followed during a preincubation period at 30 degrees C for 14 days. The sterile food packs were sealed into polyamidepolyethylene laminate bags containing different headspace gas concentrations (21% oxygen + 80% nitrogen, 5% oxygen + 95% nitrogen and 100% nitrogen). Bacterial growth was followed every second day by counting the number of colony forming units and following the headspace oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations. The bacterial strains differed in their growth characteristics, especially in their ability to consume oxygen from the headspace, and also in their ability to produce carbon dioxide. The headspace oxygen concentration was also followed by oxygen indicators in order to determine the correlation with the oxygen concentration of the headspace and the growth of bacteria. The bacterial growth followed more closely the concentration of carbon dioxide than the concentration of oxygen. It was concluded that further studies are needed to determine the preincubation period for viscous aseptic products in order to furnish accurate data on the growth characteristics of low numbers of bacteria in aseptic foods at different headspace gas compositions.
TI  - Antibacterially active substituted anilides of carboxylic and sulfonic acids.
AB  - Anilides of carboxylic and sulfonic acids were prepared and tested for antimicrobial activity. While these anilides were ineffective against Gram-negative organisms, there was a good correlation between chemical structure and biological activity against Gram-positive species. Both the nature and position of the benzene ring substituents and the length of the carbon side chain affected the activity and specificity of the compounds. The highest activity was observed when the acyl or sulfuryl moiety had a C7-C9 side chain attached. The CONH and SO2NH bridging groups were equally effective. The attachment of COOH or COOCH3 groups in the omega-position did not effect activity, but the substitution of the acidic proton of the sulfonamide group by an alkyl group rendered the compound inactive. Six compounds, which were substituted anilides of sulfonic acids, fatty acids, or the analagous alpha-methylene-substituted acids, were bacteriostatic at 10 ppm against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, and Lactobacillus plantarum. One of these compounds, 2-hydroxy-5-nitroanilide of alpha-methylenedecanoic acid, was bactericidal at 1 ppm.
TI  - Analysis of bacterial biotin-proteins.
AB  - The biotin-protein populations in several bacterial strains were analyzed by solubilization of [3H]biotin-labeled cells with sodium dodecylsulfate followed by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels containing the detergent. A variety of patterns of biotin-labeled polypeptide chains was seen, ranging from a single biotin-protein in Escherichia coli, corresponding to the biotin carboxyl carrier protein component of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, to multiple species in Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas citronellolis, Bacillus cereus, Propionibacterium shermanii, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Mycobacterium phlei, which probably represent subunits of multiple biotin-dependent enzymes present in these organisms. In the case of Pseudomonas citronellolis two major biotin-containing polypeptides with approximate molecular weights of 65 000 and 25 000 were shown to correspond to the biotin carboxyl carrier components of pyruvate carboxylase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase, respectively. Thus in the case of Pseudomonas citronellolis two different biotin-dependent enzymes in the same cell do not share common biotin carboxyl carrier subunits.
