TI  == enterobacter aerogenes and enterobacter cloacae; versatile bacterial pathogens confronting antibiotic treatment.
AB  == enterobacter aerogenes and e. cloacae have been reported as important opportunistic and multiresistant bacterial pathogens for humans during the last three decades in hospital wards. these gram-negative bacteria have been largely described during several outbreaks of hospital-acquired infections in europe and  particularly in france. the dissemination of enterobacter sp. is associated with  the presence of redundant regulatory cascades that efficiently control the membrane permeability ensuring the bacterial protection and the expression of detoxifying enzymes involved in antibiotic degradation/inactivation. in addition, these bacterial species are able to acquire numerous genetic mobile elements that strongly contribute to antibiotic resistance. moreover, this particular fitness help them to colonize several environments and hosts and rapidly and efficiently  adapt their metabolism and physiology to external conditions and environmental stresses. enterobacter is a versatile bacterium able to promptly respond to the antibiotic treatment in the colonized patient. the balance of the prevalence, e.  aerogenes versus e. cloacae, in the reported hospital infections during the last  period, questions about the horizontal transmission of mobile elements containing antibiotic resistance genes, e.g., the efficacy of the exchange of resistance genes klebsiella pneumoniae to enterobacter sp. it is also important to mention the possible role of antibiotic use in the treatment of bacterial infectious diseases in this e. aerogenes/e. cloacae evolution.

TI  == ndm-1 encoded by a pndm-bj01-like plasmid p3sp-ndm in clinical enterobacter aerogenes.
AB  == a carbapenem-nonsusceptible enterobacter aerogenes strain named 3-sp was isolated from a human case of pneumonia in a chinese teaching hospital. ndm-1 carbapenemase is produced by a pndm-bj01-like conjugative plasmid designated p3sp-ndm to account for carbapenem resistance of 3-sp. p3sp-ndm was fully sequenced and compared with all publically available pndm-bj01-like plasmids. the genetic differences between p3sp-ndm and pndm-bj01 include only 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms, a 1 bp deletion and a 706 bp deletion. p3sp-ndm and pndm-bj01 harbor an identical tn125 element organized as isaba125, bla ndm-1, ble mbl, deltatrpf, dsbc, cuta, deltagroes, groel, iscr27, and isaba125. the bla ndm-1 surrounding regions in these pndm-bj01-like plasmids have a conserved linear organization isaba14-apha6-tn125-unknown is, with considerable genetic differences identified within or immediately downstream of tn125. all reported pndm-bj01-like plasmids are exclusively found in acinetobacter, whereas this is the first report of identification of a pndm-bj01-like plasmid in enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == a sequential statistical approach towards an optimized production of a broad spectrum bacteriocin substance from a soil bacterium bacillus sp. yas 1 strain.
AB  == bacteriocins, ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides, display potential applications in agriculture, medicine, and industry. the present study highlights integral statistical optimization and partial characterization of a bacteriocin substance from a soil bacterium taxonomically affiliated as bacillus sp. yas 1 after biochemical and molecular identifications. a sequential statistical approach (plackett-burman and box-behnken) was employed to optimize bacteriocin (bac yas 1) production. using optimal levels of three key determinants (yeast extract (0.48% (w/v), incubation time (62 hrs), and agitation speed (207 rpm)) in peptone yeast beef based production medium resulted in 1.6-fold enhancement in bac yas 1 level (470 au/ml arbitrary units against erwinia amylovora). bac yas 1  showed activity over a wide range of ph (1-13) and temperature (45-80 degrees c). a wide spectrum antimicrobial activity of bac yas 1 against the human pathogens (clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus epidermidis, campylobacter jejuni, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus sp., proteus sp., klebsiella sp., and salmonella typhimurium), the plant pathogen (e. amylovora), and the food spoiler  (listeria innocua) was demonstrated. on top and above, bac yas 1 showed no antimicrobial activity towards lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus bulgaricus, l. casei, l. lactis, and l. reuteri). promising characteristics of bac yas 1 prompt  its commercialization for efficient utilization in several industries.

TI  == production of humic substances through coal-solubilizing bacteria.
AB  == in this paper, the production of humic substances (hs) through the bacterial solubilization of low rank coal (lrc) was evaluated. the evaluation was carried out by 19 bacterial strains isolated in microenvironments with high contents of coal wastes. the biotransformed lrc and the hs produced were quantified in vitro  in a liquid growth medium. the humic acids (ha) obtained from the most active bacterial strain were characterized via elemental composition (c, h, n, o), ir analyses, and the e4/e6 ratio; they were then compared with the ha extracted chemically using naoh. there was lrc biotransformation ranged from 25 to 37%, and hs production ranged from 127 to 3100 mg . l(-1). more activity was detected in the isolated strains of bacillus mycoides, microbacterium sp, acinetobacter sp, and enterobacter aerogenes. the ha produced by b. mycoides had an ir spectrum and an e4/e6 ratio similar to those of the ha extracted with naoh, but their elemental composition and their degree of aromatic condensation was different. results suggest that these bacteria can be used to exploit the lrc resulting from coal mining activities and thus produce hs in order to improve the content of humified organic matter in soils.

TI  == purification of a secreted lectin from andrias davidianus skin and its antibacterial activity.
AB  == a lectin secreted from andrias davidianus skin (adl) was purified by affinity chromatography on porcine stomach mucin (type iii) (psm)-crosslinked albumin, followed by gel filtration on sephadex g-100 and hplc on tsk gel g3000pwxl. the purified lectin was found to be a dimeric protein, as revealed by sds-page and maldi-tof analysis. sds-page showed that the adl protein had a molecular mass of  17 kda. adl produced an 8.5 kda band when examined using sds-page under reducing  conditions. adl agglutinated native and trypsinized human b erythrocytes. the hemagglutination activity was inhibited by glycoproteins, such as psm and asialo-psm, but not by any of the monosaccharides tested. the activity was stable between 4 degrees c and 50 degrees c. significant adl activity was observed between ph 4-5. the lectin reaction did not depend on the presence of the divalent cation ca2+ or mg2+. the n-terminal adl sequence was determined to be vgytvgatpm. the lectin exhibited antibacterial activity, involving growth and respiration inhibition in escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis and shewanella sp. furthermore, adl showed inhibition activity against the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. these findings suggest that adl plays an important role in the innate immunity of a. davidianus on the body surface.

TI  == health evaluation and survey of zoonotic pathogens in free-ranging capybaras (hydrochoerus hydrochaeris).
AB  == capybaras (hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) are the world's largest rodents and play an epidemiologic role in the transmission of zoonotic pathogens, including the causative agents of brazilian spotted fever, leptospirosis, and others. we surveyed the health of 31 free-ranging capybaras at the alberto lofgren state park, sao paulo, brazil using a variety of diagnostic methods. hematology and serum chemistry were consistent with mild malnutrition and parasitism but did not indicate severe physiologic imbalance or disease. all animals were serologically  negative for rickettsia rickettsii, leishmania spp., and trypanosoma sp., but antibodies against rabies virus (71%), leptospira sp. (26%), and toxoplasma sp. (23%) were detected. salmonella sp. was not cultured from fecal samples. frequently cultured enterobacteria included escherichia coli (61%), enterococcus  casseiflavus (35%), enterococcus faecalis (35%), enterobacter aerogenes (32%), klebisella pneumoniae (32%), and serratia marcescens (32%). no potentially pathogenic fungi were cultured from hair samples. fecal parasitology revealed infection by protozoophaga sp. (58%), viannella spp. (23%), strongyloides spp. (10%), and ancilostomatidae (10%). a total of 218 ticks was retrieved from the animals: amblyomma sp. larvae and nymphs (43%), a. dubitatum adults (52%), and a. cajennense adults (5%). the capybaras were free from most potentially zoonotic pathogens evaluated; however, the presence of amblyomma spp. ticks (potential vectors of rickettsia spp.) and indirect evidence of exposure to the rabies virus, leptospira sp., and toxoplasma sp. warrant the maintenance of public health programs and wildlife health monitoring.

TI  == synthesis of 2,3-butanediol by synechocystis sp. pcc6803 via heterologous expression of a catabolic pathway from lactic acid- and enterobacteria.
AB  == the direct and efficient conversion of co2 into liquid energy carriers and/or bulk chemicals is crucial for a sustainable future of modern society. here we describe the production of 2,3-butanediol in synechocystis sp. pcc6803 expressing a heterologous catabolic pathway derived from enteric- and lactic acid bacteria.  this pathway is composed of an acetolactate synthase, an acetolactate decarboxylase and an acetoin reductase. levels of up to 0.72 g/l (corresponding to 8 mmol/l) of c(4) products, including a level of 0.43 g/l (corresponding to 4.7 mmol/l) 2,3-butanediol production are observed with the genes encoding these  three enzymes integrated into the cyanobacterial genome, as well as when they are plasmid encoded. further optimization studies revealed that synechocystis expresses significant levels of acetolactate synthase endogenously, particularly  under conditions of restricted co2 supply to the cells. co-expression of a soluble transhydrogenase or of an nadph-dependent acetoin reductase allows one to drive the last step of the engineered pathway to near completion, resulting in pure meso-2,3-butanediol being produced.

TI  == comparative efficacy evaluation of disinfectants routinely used in hospital practice: india.
AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare practically achieved disinfection efficacy of some locally available disinfectants on surfaces and infectious microbiological hospital waste. materials and methods: seven disinfectants were tested at concentrations recommended by manufacturers on rough and smooth surfaces that were contaminated experimentally by locally circulating  isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, standard isolate of salmonella typhi and candida  albicans. reduction in microbial counts before and after surface disinfection was expressed as log reduction. a very heavy microbial waste load was simulated by immersing culture plates with heavy microbial growth in disinfectants. daily, a sample of disinfectant was taken and subjected to in-use test. results: the highest average log reduction of test microbes on the rough surface was given by  desnet (5.05) and bacillocid special (5.02). a comparable average log reduction of test microbes on a smooth steel surface was noted (5.68, 5.67, 5.50) for lysol, bacillocid sp. and desnet, respectively. in the discard jars, bacillocid special worked satisfactorily for 4 days, desnet for 3 days and hi-giene germitol for 1 day. the remainder of the disinfectants failed in the in-use test on day 1. phenolics, although widely used in our settings, may not be as good surface disinfectants as newer formulations like desnet and bacillocid special. conclusions: newer quaternary ammonium compounds and aldehyde formulations were found to be the best disinfectants for disinfection of heavy contamination.

TI  == isolation and identification of chromium-resistant bacteria: test application for prevention of chromium toxicity in plant.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to isolate chromium resistant bacteria and characterize in depth before being applied for bioremediation or construction of  chromium biosesnors. one of the major objectives was to identify the most useful  strains with respect to chromium removal efficiency. chromium resistant bacteria  were isolated from tannery waste samples. these were characterized through biochemical tests and antibiotic assays. cross metal reactivity, plasmid curing and cysteine quantifications were also performed. gene sequencing was done for all the isolates and accession numbers received after submission to national center for biotechnology information (ncbi). the removal capacity was also studied in broth cultures. the results were very encouraging since six new bacteria were recognised to withstand high concentrations of chromium. out of these six bacteria, three i.e. enterobacter aerogenes, aeromonas sp., acinetobacter sp. pd 12 performed very well by removing about 99% (average) from  initial 19.8 ppm of cr(vi) from a synthetic culture media. enterobacter aerogenes, being the most efficient strain, was used to remediate hexavalent chromium from soil of potted plants- very encouraging results were obtained. these bacteria may be exploited for bioremediation of cr (vi) and construction of microbial sensor in future.

TI  == bioremediation of chromium by novel strains enterobacter aerogenes t2 and acinetobacter sp. pd 12 s2.
AB  == purpose: this study had an objective to identify the most potent chromium-resistant bacteria isolated from tannery effluent and apply them for bioremediation of chromium in tannery effluents. methods: two such strains (previously characterized and identified by us)--enterobacter aerogenes (ncbi genbank usa accession no. gu265554) and acinetobacter sp. pd 12 (ncbi genbank usa accession no. gu084179)--showed powerful chromium resistivity and bioremediation  capabilities among many stains isolated from tannery waste. parameters such as ph, concentration of hexavalent chromium or cr (vi), and inoculum volume were varied to observe optimum bioconversion and bioaccumulation of cr (vi) when the said strains were grown in m9 minimal salt media. e. aerogenes was used to remediate chromium from tannery effluents in a laboratory level experiment. results: observation by scanning electron microscope and chromium peak in energy  dispersive x-ray spectroscopic microanalysis revealed that e. aerogenes helped remediate a moderate amount of cr (vi) (8-16 mg l(-1)) over a wide range of ph values at 35-37 degrees c (within 26.05 h). high inoculum percentage of acinetobacter sp. pd 12 also enabled bioremediation of 8-16 mg l(-1) of cr (vi) over a wide range of temperature (25-37 degrees c), mainly at ph 7 (within 63.28  h). the experiment with real tannery effluent gave very encouraging results. conclusion: the strain e. aerogenes can be used in bioremediation of cr (vi) since it could work in actual environmental conditions with extraordinarily high  capacity.

AB  == a local herb, kacip fatimah, is famous amongst malay women for its uses in parturition; however, its phytochemical contents have not been fully documented.  therefore, a study was performed to evaluate the phenolics, flavonoids, and total saponin contents, and antibacterial and antifungal properties of the leaf, stem and root of three varieties of labisia pumila benth. total saponins were found to be higher in the leaves of all three varieties, compared to the roots and stems.  leaves of var. pumila exhibited significantly higher total saponin content than var. alata and lanceolata, with values of 56.4, 43.6 and 42.3 mg diosgenin equivalent/g dry weight, respectively. hplc analyses of phenolics and flavonoids  in all three varieties revealed the presence of gallic acid, caffeic acid, rutin, and myricetin in all plant parts. higher levels of flavonoids (rutin, quercitin,  kaempferol) were observed in var. pumila compared with alata and lanceolata, whereas higher accumulation of phenolics (gallic acid, pyrogallol) was recorded in var. alata, followed by pumila and lanceolata. antibacterial activities of leaf, stem and root extracts of all varieties determined against both gram positive (micrococcus luteus, bacillus subtilis b145, bacillus cereus b43, staphylococcus aureus s1431) and gram negative (enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumonia k36, escherichia coli e256, pseudomonas aeruginosa pi96) pathogens showed that crude methanolic extracts are active against these bacteria at low concentrations, albeit with lower antibacterial activity compared to kanamycin used as the control. antifungal activity of methanolic extracts of all  plant parts against fusarium sp., candida sp. and mucor using the agar diffusion  disc exhibited moderate to appreciable antifungal activities compared to streptomycin used as positive control.

TI  == potential application of the nisin z preparation of lactococcus lactis w8 in preservation of milk.
AB  == aims: the aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the preparation of nisin z from lactococcus lactis w8-fermented milk in controlling the growth of spoilage bacteria in pasteurized milk. methods and results: spoilage bacteria isolated from pasteurized milk at 8 and 15 degrees c were identified as enterococcus italicus, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus thuringiensis, bacillus cereus, lactobacillus paracasei, acinetobacter sp., pseudomonas fluorescens and enterobacter aerogenes. these bacteria were found to  have the ability to survive pasteurization temperature. except enterobacter aerogenes, the spoilage bacteria were sensitive to the nisin z preparation of the l. lactis w8. addition of the nisin z preparation to either the skim milk or fat  milk inoculated with each of the spoilage bacteria reduced the initial counts (about 5 log cfu ml(-)(1)) to an undetectable level within 8-20 h. the nisin z preparation extended the shelf life of milk to 2 months under refrigeration. conclusions: the nisin z preparation from l. lactis w8-fermented milk was found to be effective as a backup preservative to counteract postpasteurization contamination in milk. significance and impact of the study: a rapid inhibition of spoilage bacteria in pasteurized skim and fat milk with the nisin z preparation of l. lactis w8 is more significant in comparison with the commercially available nisin (nisin a). the nisin z preparation can be used instead of commercial nisin, which is not effective in fat milk.

TI  == bacteriologic and plasmid analysis of etiologic agents of conjunctivitis in lagos, nigeria.
AB  == background: conjunctivitis, an inflammation of the conjunctiva, is one of the most common eye problems affecting all age groups in nigeria. a better understanding of its epidemiology and the antibiotic susceptibility of etiologic  bacterial agents is crucial for the initiation of preventive and therapeutic measures. this study determined the distribution and patterns of bacterial infections in nigerian patients with conjunctivitis. antibiotic resistance patterns and the plasmid profiles of these pathogens were also investigated. methodology: a total of 83 consecutive and non-duplicate conjunctival specimens were collected from patients attending eye clinics at three different hospitals in lagos, nigeria, between february and september 2010. specimens were cultured on standard bacteriologic media and the recovered isolates speciated using standard techniques. susceptibility of pathogens to antibiotics and plasmid dna extraction were carried out by disk diffusion and alkaline lysis methods. conjugation experiment was done with rifampicin-resistant escherichia coli dh5alpha as the recipient cell. data were analyzed using the chi-square test. results: all the specimens were culture-positive, yielding a total of 155 bacterial isolates. gram-positive cocci comprising staphylococcus aureus (27.7%)  and coagulase-negative staphylococcus sp. (22.6%) accounted for 50.3% (78 of 155) of conjunctivitis cases, followed by gram-positive bacilli (22.6%), gram-negative bacilli (21.3%), and gram-negative cocci (4.5%). corynebacterium spp. were the most commonly isolated gram-positive bacilli accounting for 16.1% of conjunctivitis cases. pseudomonas aeruginosa topped with 9.7% as the most commonly isolated gram-negative bacilli. other gram-negative bacilli in order of  their isolations were e. coli (6.5%), proteus sp. (3.2%), klebsiella sp. (1.9%),  and enterobacter aerogenes (1.9%). moraxella spp. were the only gram-negative cocci isolated, and they accounted for 4.5% of the total conjunctival infections. further analysis of the complexity of infections showed that 25 specimens elicited mono-infections, while cases of polymicrobial infections caused by two pathogens and three or more pathogens constituted 51.8% and 18.1% of conjunctivitis specimens screened, respectively. the disparity in the percentage  contribution of three infection patterns was significant (p < 0.05). antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed chloramphenicol and ofloxacin as the least and most active antibiotics tested as 99 (63.9%) and 149 (96.1%) of the 155 recovered isolates were sensitive to them. on the whole, the least susceptible pathogen was p. aeruginosa with sensitivities ranging from 20% to 80%, while moraxella sp. represented the most sensitive pathogen with sensitivities ranging from 71.4% to  100%. other bacterial isolates also elicited antibiotic sensitivities in the range of 33.3-100%. a total of 101 isolates were screened for plasmids, of which  45 harbored plasmids, yielding a plasmid frequency of 44.6%. conjugal transfer of resistance to chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and streptomycin was detected in the transconjugants after the mating experiment. the antibiotic resistances were transferred either singly or in combination from six of the seven selected donor  strains. the antibiotic resistance pattern transferred by these donor strains was partial and was associated with the transfer of r plasmids of sizes 21.3, 15.2, and 5.0 kb from three of the six transferable strains. the frequencies of transfer of antibiotype or r plasmids to the transconjugants ranged from 1.8 x 10(-7) to 1.4 x 10(-5) transconjugants per donor strain. conclusion: conjunctivitis as an eye problem in lagos is polymicrobial with infections associated with transferable r plasmids for chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and streptomycin. continuous surveillance of conjunctivitis in relation to etiology,  drug susceptibility, and plasmid transferability in the study area is therefore recommended.

TI  == protozoan growth rates on secondary-metabolite-producing pseudomonas spp. correlate with high-level protozoan taxonomy.
AB  == different features can protect bacteria against protozoan grazing, for example large size, rapid movement, and production of secondary metabolites. most papers  dealing with these matters focus on bacteria. here, we describe protozoan features that affect their ability to grow on secondary-metabolite-producing bacteria, and examine whether different bacterial secondary metabolites affect protozoa similarly. we investigated the growth of nine different soil protozoa on six different pseudomonas strains, including the four secondary-metabolite-producing pseudomonas fluorescens dr54 and cha0, pseudomonas chlororaphis ma342 and pseudomonas sp. dss73, as well as the two nonproducers p.  fluorescens dsm50090(t) and p. chlororaphis atcc43928. secondary metabolite producers affected protozoan growth differently. in particular, bacteria with extracellular secondary metabolites seemed more inhibiting than bacteria with membrane-bound metabolites. interestingly, protozoan response seemed to correlate with high-level protozoan taxonomy, and amoeboid taxa tolerated a broader range of pseudomonas strains than did the non-amoeboid taxa. this stresses the importance of studying both protozoan and bacterial characteristics in order to understand bacterial defence mechanisms and potentially improve survival of bacteria introduced into the environment, for example for biocontrol purposes.

TI  == phytoremediation of mercury in pristine and crude oil contaminated soils: contributions of rhizobacteria and their host plants to mercury removal.
AB  == the rhizospheric soils of three tested legume crops: broad beans (vicia faba), beans (phaseolus vulgaris) and pea (pisum sativum), and two nonlegume crops: cucumber (cucumis sativus) and tomato, (lycopersicon esculentum) contained considerable numbers (the magnitude of 10(5)g(-1) soil) of bacteria with the combined potential for hydrocarbon-utilization and mercury-resistance. sequencing of the 16s rrna coding genes of rhizobacteria associated with broad beans revealed that they were affiliated to citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, exiquobacterium aurantiacum, pseudomonas veronii, micrococcus luteus,  brevibacillus brevis, arthrobacter sp. and flavobacterium psychrophilum. these rhizobacteria were also diazotrophic, i.e. capable of n(2) fixation, which makes  them self-sufficient regarding their nitrogen nutrition and thus suitable remediation agents in nitrogen-poor soils, such as the oily desert soil. the crude oil attenuation potential of the individual rhizobacteria was inhibited by  hgcl(2), but about 50% or more of this potential was still maintained in the presence of up to 40 mgl(-1) hgcl(2). rhizobacteria-free plants removed amounts of mercury from the surrounding media almost equivalent to those removed by the rhizospheric bacterial consortia in the absence of the plants. it was concluded that both the collector plants and their rhizospheric bacterial consortia contributed equivalently to mercury removal from soil.

AB  == the efficacy of four potential phosphate solubilizing enterobacter isolated from  non-rhizospheric soil in western ghat forest in india. plant growth promoting ability of these isolates was evaluated in cowpea. all are gram negative, rod shaped, 0.8-1.6 mm in size, and psychrotrophic in nature, grow from 5 to 40 degrees c (optimum temp. 28 +/- 2 degrees c). all isolates exhibits growth at a wide range of ph 6-12, optimum at ph 7.0 and tolerates up to 7% (w/v) salt concentration. 16s rrna gene sequencing reveals the confirmation of isolates to enterobacter aerogenes sp. (nii-0907 and nii-0929), enterobacter cloacae subsp. cloacae sp. (nii-0931) and enterobacter asburiae sp. (nii-0934) with which they share >99% sequence similarity. under in vitro conditions, all the four isolates  were found to produce indole acetic acid, p-solubilization and hydrogen cyanide.  the p-solubilizing activity coincided with a concomitant decrease in ph of the medium (ph 7.0-<3.0). the plant growth promotion properties were demonstrated through a cow pea (vigna unguiculata (l.) walp) based bioassay under greenhouse conditions. although the bacterial inoculation was found to result in significant increment in root, shoot and biomass and it stimulated bacterial counts in the rhizosphere. hence, these isolates can further formulated and used for field application.

TI  == reconstruction of the violacein biosynthetic pathway from duganella sp. b2 in different heterologous hosts.
AB  == violacein is a bacteria-originated indolocarbazole pigment with potential applications due to its various bioactivities such as anti-tumor, antiviral, and  antifungal activities. however, stable mass production of this pigment is difficult due to its low productivities and the instability of wild-type violacein-producing strains. in order to establish a stable and efficient production system for violacein, the violacein synthesis pathway from a new species of duganella sp. b2 was reconstructed in different bacterial strains including escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, and enterobacter aerogenes by using different vectors. the gene cluster that encodes five enzymes involved in the violacein biosynthetic pathway was first isolated from duganella sp. b2, and  three recombinant expression vectors were constructed using the t7 promoter or the alkane-responsive promoter palkb. our results showed that violacein could be  stably synthesized in e. coli, c. freundii, and e. aerogenes. interestingly, we found that there were great differences between the different recombinant strains, not only in the protein expression profiles pertaining to violacein biosynthesis but also in the productivity and composition of crude violacein. among the host strains tested, the crude violacein production by the recombinant  c. freundii strain reached 1.68 g l(-1) in shake flask cultures, which was 4-fold higher than the highest production previously reported in flask culture by other  groups. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the efficient production of violacein by genetically engineered strains.

AB  == the conjugative plasmid pola52, which confers resistance to olaquindox and other  antimicrobial agents through a multidrug efflux pump, was investigated for its ability to promote biofilm formation in escherichia coli. screening of a transposon-mutagenized pola52 clone library revealed several biofilm-deficient mutants, which all mapped within a putative operon with high homology to the mrkabcdf operon of klebsiella pneumoniae, where these genes are responsible for type 3 fimbriae expression, attachment to surfaces and biofilm formation. biofilm formation in microtitre plates and in urinary catheters of clones containing pola52 with a disrupted putative mrk operon was reduced by more than 100-fold and 2-fold, respectively, compared to mutants with an intact mrk operon. the conjugative transfer rate of pola52 was also significantly lower when the mrk operon was disrupted. through reverse transcriptase analysis, it was demonstrated that the genes contained in the putative mrk operon were linked and likely to be  expressed as a single operon. immunoblotting with type 3 fimbriae (mrka)-specific antibodies further verified expression of type 3 fimbriae. when transferred to other, potentially pathogenic, members of the family enterobacteriaceae, including klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhimurium, kluyvera sp. and enterobacter aerogenes, pola52 facilitated increased biofilm formation. pola52 is believed to represent the first example of a conjugative plasmid encoding type 3  fimbriae, resulting in enhanced conjugation frequencies and biofilm formation of  the plasmid-harbouring strain.

AB  == objectives: a plasmid-encoded multidrug efflux pump, oqxab, identified in escherichia coli of porcine origin, was tested for substrate specificity against  selected antibiotics, detergents and disinfectants. the ability of horizontal transfer to food-borne pathogens of the enterobacteriaceae family was also investigated. methods: the mics of selected substrates were determined with a broth dilution assay using two isogenic e. coli strains, except for the presence  of the oqxab operon. a derivative of the plasmid encoding oqxab (pola52) was constructed and horizontal transfer to salmonella typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae, kluyvera sp. and enterobacter aerogenes was investigated. the effect  of the presence of the oqxab pump on susceptibility for selected compounds was investigated using broth dilution assays. results: the oqxab pump conferred antimicrobial resistance or reduced susceptibility towards a variety of substrates in e. coli. these included animal growth promoters, antimicrobials, disinfectants and detergents. pola52 could readily be transferred to enterobacterial pathogens. transconjugants showed reduced susceptibility towards  chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin and olaquindox. conclusions: the plasmid-encoded oqxab pump has a wide substrate specificity and can be transferred between enterobacteriaceae conferring reduced susceptibility to a multitude of substrates. these results could indicate some dependence on the outer membrane proteins present in the different species.

TI  == inhibition of hydrogen uptake in escherichia coli by expressing the hydrogenase from the cyanobacterium synechocystis sp. pcc 6803.
AB  == background: molecular hydrogen is an environmentally-clean fuel and the reversible (bi-directional) hydrogenase of the cyanobacterium synechocystis sp. pcc 6803 as well as the native escherichia coli hydrogenase 3 hold great promise  for hydrogen generation. these enzymes perform the simple reaction 2h+ + 2e- <--> h2 (g). results: hydrogen yields were enhanced up to 41-fold by cloning the bidirectional hydrogenase (encoded by hoxefuyh) from the cyanobacterium into e. coli. using an optimized medium, e. coli cells expressing hoxefuyh also produced  twice as much hydrogen as the well-studied enterobacter aerogenes hu-101, and hydrogen gas bubbles are clearly visible from the cultures. overexpression of hoxu alone (small diaphorase subunit) accounts for 43% of the additional hydrogen produced by hoxefuyh. in addition, hydrogen production in e. coli mutants with defects in the native formate hydrogenlyase system show that the cyanobacterial hydrogenase depends on both the native e. coli hydrogenase 3 as well as on its maturation proteins. hydrogen absorption by cells expressing hoxefuyh was up to 10 times lower than cells which lack the cloned cyanobacterial hydrogenase; hence, the enhanced hydrogen production in the presence of hoxefuyh is due to inhibition of hydrogen uptake activity in e. coli. hydrogen uptake by cells expressing hoxefuyh was suppressed in three wild-type strains and in two hyce mutants but not in a double mutant defective in hydrogenase 1 and hydrogenase 2;  hence, the active cyanobacterial locus suppresses hydrogen uptake by hydrogenase  1 and hydrogenase 2 but not by hydrogenase 3. differential gene expression indicated that overexpression of hoxefuyh does not alter expression of the native e. coli hydrogenase system; instead, biofilm-related genes are differentially regulated by expression of the cyanobacterial enzymes which resulted in 2-fold elevated biofilm formation. this appears to be the first enhanced hydrogen production by cloning a cyanobacterial enzyme into a heterologous host. conclusion: enhanced hydrogen production in e. coli cells expressing the cyanobacterial hoxefuyh is by inhibiting hydrogen uptake of both hydrogenase 1 and hydrogenase 2.

TI  == detecting the form of selection in the outer membrane protein c of enterobacter aerogenes strains and salmonella species.
AB  == the types of selective pressure operating on the outer membrane protein c (ompc)  of enterobacter aerogenes strains, the causative agent for nosocomial infections, and salmonella sp., the hazardous pathogen are investigated using the maximum likelihood-based codon substitution models. although the rate of amino acid replacement to the silent substitution (omega) across the entire codon sites of ompc of e. aerogenes (omega=0.3194) and salmonella sp. (omega=0.2047) indicate that the gene is subjected to purifying selection (i.e. omega<1), approximately 3.7% of ompc codon sites in e. aerogenes (omega=21.52) are under the influence of positive darwinian selection (i.e. omega>1). such contrast in the intensity of selective pressures in both pathogens could be associated with the differential response to the adverse environmental changes. in e. aerogenes, majority of the positively selected sites are located in the hypervariable cell-surface-exposed domains whereas the trans-membrane domains are functionally highly constrained.

AB  == study objective: to identify predictors of in-hospital mortality among patients with bacteremia caused by enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, or citrobacter freundii. design: retrospective cohort study. setting: 1300-bed tertiary academic medical center. patients: one hundred twenty-four patients who  had bloodstream infections caused by e. cloacae (3), e. aerogenes (71), or c. freundii (50) between 1998 and 2004. measurements and main results: data from patients with bloodstream infections caused by enterobacter sp or c. freundii were retrospectively segregated according to hospital survival (98 survivors, 26  nonsurvivors). multiple patient characteristics and processes of care were evaluated to identify factors contributing to in-hospital mortality. multiple logistic regression was performed based on univariate comparisons to determine independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality. among the 124 cases of bacteremia, the crude in-hospital mortality rate was 21% (26 cases). univariate analysis revealed that survivors were more likely to receive an aminoglycoside as part of their empiric antimicrobial regimen (40% [39/98]) compared with nonsurvivors (19% [5/26], p=0.05). other factors related to antimicrobial therapy including choice and number of agents used did not differ between survivors and nonsurvivors (p>0.05). vasopressor use (31% [30/98] vs 62% [16/26]), care in an intensive care unit (19% [19/98] vs 54% [14/26]), and acute renal failure (13% [13/98] vs 31% [8/26]) occurred more frequently in nonsurvivors (p<0.05). multiple logistic regression identified resistance to second- or third-generation cephalosporins (adjusted odds ratio [or] 5.16, 95% confidence interval [ci] 2.66-10.0, p=0.013), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance (adjusted or 5.44,  95% ci 2.53-11.7, p=0.027), and mechanical ventilation (adjusted or 12.2, 95% ci  5.99-24.5, p<0.001) as independent determinants of mortality. conclusion: among patients with enterobacter sp or c. freundii bloodstream infections, those with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-resistant or second or third-generation cephalosporin-resistant strains or those who required mechanical ventilation had  an increased risk of mortality.

TI  == antimicrobial activities of cinnamon oil and cinnamaldehyde from the chinese medicinal herb cinnamomum cassia blume.
AB  == both cinnamomum verum j.s. presl. and cinnamomum cassia blume are collectively called cortex cinnamonmi for their medicinal cinnamon bark. cinnamomum verum is more popular elsewhere in the world, whereas c. cassia is a well known traditional chinese medicine. an analysis of hydro-distilled chinese cinnamon oil and pure cinnamaldehyde by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry revealed that cinnamaldehyde is the major component comprising 85% in the essential oil and the purity of cinnamaldehyde in use is high (> 98%). both oil and pure cinnamaldehyde of c. cassia were equally effective in inhibiting the growth of various isolates  of bacteria including gram-positive (1 isolate, staphylococcus aureus), and gram-negative (7 isolates, e. coli, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, vibrio cholerae, vibrio parahaemolyticus and samonella typhymurium), and fungi including yeasts (four species of candida, c. albicans, c. tropicalis, c. glabrata, and c. krusei), filamentous molds (4 isolates, three  aspergillus spp. and one fusarium sp.) and dermatophytes (three isolates, microsporum gypseum, trichophyton rubrum and t. mentagraphytes). their minimum inhibition concentrations (mic) as determined by agar dilution method varied only slightly. the mics of both oil and cinnamaldehyde for bacteria ranged from 75 microg/ml to 600 microg/ml, for yeasts from 100 microg/ml to 450 microg/ml, for filamentous fungi from 75 microg/ml to 150 microg/ml, and for dermatophytes from  18.8 microg/ml to 37.5 microg/ml. the antimicrobial effectiveness of c. cassia oil and its major constituent is comparable and almost equivalent, which suggests that the broad-spectrum antibiotic activities of c. cassia oil are due to cinnamaldehyde. the relationship between structure and function of the main components of cinnamon oil is also discussed.

AB  == mexican tarragon (tagetes lucida cv. asteraceae: campanulatae) is an important, nutritious plant and an effective herbal medicine. seven coumarins, 7,8-dihydroxycoumarin (4), umbelliferone (7-hydroxycoumarin) (5), scoparone (6,7-dimethoxycoumarin) (7), esculetin (6,7-dihydroxycoumarin) (11), 6-hydroxy-7-methoxycoumarin (12), herniarin (7-methoxycoumarin) (13), and scopoletin (6-methoxy-7-hydroxycoumarin) (14), and three flavonoids, patuletin (18), quercetin (19), and quercetagetin (20), were isolated from ch2cl2 and meoh  extracts from aerial parts of t. lucida. in addition, 6,7-diacetoxy coumarin (15), 6-methoxy-7-acetylcoumarin (16), and 6-acetoxy-7-methoxycoumarin (17) derivatives were synthesized. 8-methoxypsoralen (1), 8-acetyl-7-hydroxycoumarin (2), 7,8-dihydroxy-6-meth-oxycoumarin (3), 6,7-dimethoxy-4-methylcoumarin (6), 5,7-dihydroxy-4-methylcoumarin (8), 4-hydroxycoumarin (9), 4-hydroxy-6,7-dimethylcoumarin (10), naringenin (21), glycoside-7-rhamnonaringin  (22), and rutin (23) were commercially obtained (sigma-aldrich). all of these compounds and extracts (m1 and m2) were assayed against bacteria and fungi. the antibacterial activity was determined on bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhi, salmonella sp., shigella boydii, shigella sp., enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter agglomerans,  sarcina lutea, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterolitica, vibrio cholerae (three el tor strains, cdc-v12, clinic case, and indre-206, were obtained from contaminated water), and v. cholerae (no-o1). the evaluated fungi were aspergillus niger, penicillium notatum, fusarium moniliforme, fusarium sporotrichum, rhizoctonia solani, and trichophyton mentagrophytes. the most active compounds against gram-positive and -negative bacteria were the dihydroxylated coumarins 3 and 4. in addition, 2-4, 6, 7, and 11 showed an interesting activity against v. cholerae, a key bacterium in the contaminated water; 2-4 were the most active. coumarins were the most effective compounds against gram-negative bacteria. the extract meoh/ch2cl2 (1: 4) m2 at 0.4 microg/disk inhibited the growth of e. coli and p. mirabilis (40%), k. pneumoniae (31.1%), salmonella sp. (35.5%), and shigella sp. (0%) at 72 h of culture. the dimethoxy compounds 6 and 7 showed a strong activity against fungal  strains, especially t. mentagrophytes and r. solani (100% of inhibition at 125.0  and 250.0 microg/ml, respectively).

TI  == differential activity of a lectin from solieria filiformis against human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == a lectin isolated from the red alga solieria filiformis was evaluated for its effect on the growth of 8 gram-negative and 3 gram-positive bacteria cultivated in liquid medium (three independent experiments/bacterium). the lectin (500 microg/ml) stimulated the growth of the gram-positive species bacillus cereus and inhibited the growth of the gram-negative species serratia marcescens, salmonella typhi, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus sp, and pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1000 microg/ml but the lectin (10-1000 microg/ml) had no effect on  the growth of the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus and b. subtilis, or on the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium. the purified lectin significantly reduced the cell density of gram-negative bacteria, although no changes in growth phases (log, exponential and of decline) were observed. it is possible that the interaction of s. filiformis lectin with the cell surface receptors of gram-negative bacteria promotes alterations in the flow of nutrients, which would explain the bacteriostatic effect. growth stimulation of the gram-positive bacterium b. cereus was more marked in the presence of the lectin at a concentration of 1000 microg/ml. the stimulation of the growth of b.  cereus was not observed when the lectin was previously incubated with mannan (125 microg/ml), its hapten. thus, we suggest the involvement of the binding site of the lectin in this effect. the present study reports the first data on the inhibition and stimulation of pathogenic bacterial cells by marine alga lectins.

AB  == asymptomatic prostatitis is classified as category iv in nih classification of prostatitis syndrome (1999). no report concerning this category has been present. we investigated this category histopathologically and clinically, in order to clarify the histopathological distribution and its correlation to the clinical features, in this study. among 785 patients who were suspected prostate cancer because of their high prostatic specific antigen (psa) values and to have a sextant prostate needle biopsy was performed between january, 1996 and december,  2000, 88 patients (11.2%) were diagnosed as nih category iv prostatitis (asymptomatic prostatitis). we observed all pathological specimens stained with hematoxylin-eosine, and classified them into subtypes according to the classification criteria for prostatitis defined by true et al. (1999). we also investigated the relationship between histopathological distribution and clinical features such as psa values, psa density, the incidence of pyuria or bacteriuria. in the histopathological study, grade distributions were 12.5% (11/88) in mild, 71.6% (63/88) in moderate, and 15.9% (14/88) in severe. location distributions were 2.3% (2/88) in glandular, 68.2% (60/88) in periglandular, and 29.5% (26/88)  in stromal. no relationship between these subtypes and clinical features was recognized statistically. however, 7 patients (7.95%) were diagnosed as prostate  cancers, later. pyuria was found in 29.1% (23/79). bacteriuria was present in 14.3% (11/77). isolated bacteria were 4 strains of enterococcus faccalis, 2 strains of each of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus, and one strain of each of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, staphylococcus haemolyticus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. gram positive rod, and candida sp. no relationship between these subtypes and bacterial species was recognized. these results indicated that the incidence of niii category iv prostatits was not low without correlation to any clinical features. however, we should pay attention to the presence of prostate cancer, because a small number of the patients were diagnosed as prostate cancer, later.

TI  == surfactant proteins a and d inhibit the growth of gram-negative bacteria by increasing membrane permeability.
AB  == the pulmonary collectins, surfactant proteins a (sp-a) and d (sp-d), have been reported to bind lipopolysaccharide (lps), opsonize microorganisms, and enhance the clearance of lung pathogens. in this study, we examined the effect of sp-a and sp-d on the growth and viability of gram-negative bacteria. the pulmonary clearance of escherichia coli k12 was reduced in sp-a-null mice and was increased in sp-d-overexpressing mice, compared with strain-matched wild-type controls. purified sp-a and sp-d inhibited bacterial synthetic functions of several, but not all, strains of e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter aerogenes. in general, rough e. coli strains were more susceptible than smooth strains, and  collectin-mediated growth inhibition was partially blocked by coincubation with rough lps vesicles. although both sp-a and sp-d agglutinated e. coli k12 in a calcium-dependent manner, microbial growth inhibition was independent of bacterial aggregation. at least part of the antimicrobial activity of sp-a and sp-d was localized to their c-terminal domains using truncated recombinant proteins. incubation of e. coli k12 with sp-a or sp-d increased bacterial permeability. deletion of the e. coli ompa gene from a collectin-resistant smooth e. coli strain enhanced sp-a and sp-d-mediated growth inhibition. these data indicate that sp-a and sp-d are antimicrobial proteins that directly inhibit the  proliferation of gram-negative bacteria in a macrophage- and aggregation-independent manner by increasing the permeability of the microbial cell membrane.

AB  == background & objectives: extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) hydrolyse expanded spectrum cephalosporins like ceftazidime, cefotaxime and monobactam aztreonam. esbl producing bacteria may not be detectable in the routine disk diffusion susceptibility tests leading to inappropriate use of antibiotics and treatment failures. as information on esbl producers causing urinary tract infection (uti) is not available from our country, the occurrence of esbl producing strains causing uti was studied as also the differences between the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of esbl and non-esbl producers. methods: urinary isolates (233) were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility by stoke's method and esbl production by double disk diffusion method (ceftazidime and clavulanic acid). the clinical and demographic profile of the patients was noted. results: sixty two of the 233 isolates tested (26.6%) were esbl producers. approximately 38.5 per cent of klebsiellae, 24.7 per cent of escherichia coli, 24 per cent of enterobacter aerogenes, 33.3 per cent of proteus sp. and the only citrobacter strain produced esbl. recent surgery was found to be a significant (p < 0.01) risk factor for acquisition of esbls. approximately 30 per cent of the esbl producers appeared falsely sensitive or moderately sensitive to cefotaxime/ceftazidime in routine susceptibility testing. there was no difference between the esbl producers and non-producers in the susceptibility to non-beta lactam agents except for gentamicin. interpretation & conclusion: a high percentage of urinary tract isolates produced esbl. since they are likely to be missed in routine disk diffusion susceptibility tests, all microbiology laboratories should look for esbl production routinely to avoid treatment failures.

AB  == the complete 108,845-nucleotide sequence of catabolic plasmid padp-1 from pseudomonas sp. strain adp was determined. plasmid padp-1 was previously shown to encode atza, atzb, and atzc, which catalyze the sequential hydrolytic removal of  s-triazine ring substituents from the herbicide atrazine to yield cyanuric acid.  computational analyses indicated that padp-1 encodes 104 putative open reading frames (orfs), which are predicted to function in catabolism, transposition, and  plasmid maintenance, transfer, and replication. regions encoding transfer and replication functions of padp-1 had 80 to 100% amino acid sequence identity to pr751, an incpbeta plasmid previously isolated from enterobacter aerogenes. padp-1 was shown to contain a functional mercury resistance operon with 99% identity to tn5053. complete copies of transposases with 99% amino acid sequence  identity to tnpa from is1071 and tnpa from pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes were identified and flank each of the atza, atzb, and atzc genes, forming structures resembling nested catabolic transposons. functional analyses identified three new catabolic genes, atzd, atze, and atzf, which participate in atrazine catabolism.  crude extracts from escherichia coli expressing atzd hydrolyzed cyanuric acid to  biuret. atzd showed 58% amino acid sequence identity to trzd, a cyanuric acid amidohydrolase, from pseudomonas sp. strain nrrlb-12227. two other genes encoding the further catabolism of cyanuric acid, atze and atzf, reside in a contiguous cluster adjacent to a potential lysr-type transcriptional regulator. e. coli strains bearing atze and atzf were shown to encode a biuret hydrolase and allophanate hydrolase, respectively. atzdef are cotranscribed. atze and atzf are  members of a common amidase protein family. these data reveal the complete structure of a catabolic plasmid and show that the atrazine catabolic genes are dispersed on three disparate regions of the plasmid. these results begin to provide insight into how plasmids are structured, and thus evolve, to encode the  catabolism of compounds recently added to the biosphere.

TI  == multiple organ failure in septic patients.
AB  == multiple organ failure (mof) is the main cause of death in icus, especially affecting septic patients. it is strongly related to number of systems with failure, type of system involved, risk factors such as age, previous chronic diseases, delayed or inadequate resuscitation, persistent infection, immune suppression, and others. the prognoses is worse for patients rather than in elective or emergency surgical patients. the objective of this article is to provide data from our university teaching hospital icu related to the incidence of septic patients, the distribution of mof, and distribution of failure among each of the organs. the mortality rate, relationship between mortality and age, and mortality and types of organs affected were evaluated. the main bacterial causes of sepsis were also identified. a retrospective evaluation was done of 249 patients admitted to the icu in a 4 month period during 1999. fifty four patients had sepsis diagnosed by accs/sccm criteria. there were 37 men and 17 women; 24 medical and 30 post-surgical patients (9 after elective surgery and 21 emergency  patients). apache ii score was calculated on admission and mof, measured for the  first five days, was diagnosed using marshall and meakins criteria. the statistical method used was non-parametric mann-whitney test, p<0.05 was considered significant. the incidence of sepsis was recorded in 54/249 patients (22%). thirty of these 54 patients (56%) died. death occurred in 2 of 11 patients with one organ failure (18%), in 14/27 with 2 or 3 organ failures (52%), and 14/16 with 4 or more organ failures (88%). none of the three patients 15 to 20 years old died, 17/32 (55%) patients age 21-60 years, and >61 years 13/19 (68%),  died. there were 23 patients with positive bacterial culture. the most frequent bacteria found were: pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), multiresistant acinetobacter baumanii (3), staphylococcus epidermidis (3), enterobacter aerogenes (3), klebsiella pneumoniae (2) and multiresistant staphylococcus aureus (2). the mean  value +/- sd of apache ii (mortality risk) for survivors was 21 +/- 18 and for non-survivors 42 +/- 26 (p<0.001). we conclude that mof due to sepsis in an icu is frequent, with high mortality related to the number of failing organs, age and high apache ii.

TI  == the bacteriology of neonatal septicaemia in ile-ife, nigeria.
AB  == the incidence of septicaemia among neonates categorized as being at high risk was 55 per cent in ile-ife, nigeria. gram-positive organisms, specifically staphylococcus aureus, were predominant (33.8 per cent) among bacteria cultured from proven cases of septicaemia. other coagulase-negative staphylococci also contributed 21 per cent, with staphylococcus epidermidis occurring in 5 per cent  of the isolates. listeria monocytogenes was cultured from 8.4 per cent of septic  neonates. pseudomonas aeruginosa was cultured from 3 per cent, klebsiella pneumoniae from 14 per cent, and escherichia coli from 7 per cent. other gram-negative bacilli cultured were enterobacter aerogenes (5 per cent), citrobacter freundii, salmonella sp., and proteus sp. (2 per cent each). the bacterial isolates were relatively resistant to antibiotics traditionally employed to treat cases of septicaemia. the study shows a high prevalence of neonatal bacterial sepsis at the centre and the emerging role of listeria monocytogenes in the aetiology of neonatal sepsis. it highlights the preponderance of multiple antibiotic resistant organisms among these neonates early in life which is of epidemiological importance in the control of the infectious agents.

TI  == [in vitro antimicrobial activity of cefpirome compared to other broad-spectrum beta-lactam drugs against 804 clinical isolates from 9 brazilian hospitals].
AB  == objective: to evaluate the in vitro activity of the fourth-generation cephalosporin cefpirome in comparison to that of ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and imipenem in a multicenter study involving nine hospitals from six  cities (four states). material and method: a total of 804 isolates from patients  hospitalized in either intensive care units or oncology/hematology units was evaluated. the isolates were collected between june and november of 1995, i.e. before cefpirome became commercially available in brazil, and susceptibility tested by broth microdilution following the nccls procedures. all isolates resistant to cefpirome were retested by e-test. results: against enterobacteriaceae (n = 344), cefpirome demonstrated an activity 2 to 32-fold higher than that of the third-generation cephalosporins (tgcs) and similar to that of imipenem. the percentages of enterobacteriaceae susceptible were: 88%, 69% and 96% for cefpirome, tgcs and imipenem, respectively. the cefpirome spectrum was greater or equal than that of imipenem against citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, morganella morganii and serratia marcescens. against acinetobacter sp. (n = 77), cefpirome was slightly more active than ceftazidime;  however, the percentages of isolates resistant to these compounds were high (84%  and 88%, respectively). the activities of cefpirome, ceftazidime and imipenem were very similar against p. aeruginosa isolates (n = 128), with mic50(mg/ml)/percent susceptible of 8/59%, 8/62% and 4/62% respectively. against  aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the cefpirome activity was 4 to 16-fold higher than that of tgcs but 2 to 8-fold lower than that of imipenem. conclusion: the results suggest that, in brazil, cefpirome has a spectrum of activity which is higher than that of the tgcs against aerobic gram-negative (enterobacteriaceae and non-enterobacteriaceae) and gram-positive bacteria and similar to that of imipenem against some enterobacteriaceae species and p. aeruginosa.

TI  == identification of a common structural motif in the disordered n-terminal region of bacterial flagellins--evidence for a new class of fibril-forming peptides.
AB  == flagellin proteins lacking the n- or c-terminus form polymers of reduced filament stability and straight morphology, in contrast to the coiled native flagella. in  the present study, the n-terminal amino acid sequence of flagellins of the anaerobic beer spoilage bacteria pectinatus cerevisiiphilus and pectinatus frisingiensis as well as enterobacter aerogenes and pseudomonas sp. were determined. sequence similarity was revealed between these and the n-termini of all known eubacterial flagellins. synthetic peptides corresponding to the first 15 amino acid residues of the flagellins of pectinatus, campylobacter jejuni, e.  aerogenes or proteus mirabilis flagellins had a spontaneous tendency under physiological conditions to form 4-6 nm broad, 1-2 microm long fibrillar structures that had a tendency to form clusters. in contrast, the pectinatus peptide missing residues 1-3 did not form fibrils. the peptide missing residues 13-15 formed fibrils less easily, and the peptide missing residues 11-15 formed fibrils almost without clustering. in electron micrographs, the fibrillisation of the bacterial flagellar peptides resembled that of beta-amyloid and prion peptides. 1h-nmr and infrared spectroscopy studies with homology analysis indicate that although the flagellar n-terminal peptides are flexible with many conformational minima, they have a significant tendency to form beta-type structures and a loop in the middle of the peptide. the hydrophobic character of  the n-terminus together with the property of forming a conserved beta-strand-loop-beta-strand motif may be related to a mechanism involved in attaining the proper morphology and stability of the flagellar filament, by providing a device for facilitating the attachment of the flagellin monomers to each other. the flagellar peptides represent a new class of fibril-forming peptides.

TI  == adhesive properties and antibiotic resistance of klebsiella, enterobacter, and serratia clinical isolates involved in nosocomial infections.
AB  == intestinal colonization by klebsiella, enterobacter, and serratia (kes) strains is a crucial step in the development of nosocomial infections. we studied the adhesive properties, antibiotic resistance, and involvement in colonization or infection of 103 kes clinical isolates: 30 klebsiella pneumoniae (29%), 16 klebsiella oxytoca (15%), 30 enterobacter aerogenes (29%), 14 enterobacter cloacae (14%), and 13 serratia sp. (13%) isolates. half of them were resistant to several antimicrobial agents, including aminoglycosides and beta-lactam antibiotics. a total of 27 of 30 k. pneumoniae isolates (90%) adhered to the human cell line intestine-407 (int-407), while none of the k. oxytoca or e. aerogenes isolates and only 2 of the e. cloacae isolates adhered. three adhesive  patterns were observed for k. pneumoniae: an aggregative adhesion in 57% of the isolates, a diffuse adhesion in only one isolate, and a new pattern, localized adhesion, in 30% of the isolates. while most of the sensitive strains adhered with the aggregative phenotype, the localized pattern was associated with resistant k. pneumoniae isolates producing the caz-5 beta-lactamase. furthermore, 45% of such localized-adhesion isolates were involved in severe infections. the distributions of type 1 and type 3 fimbriae, enteroaggregative e. coli, and cf29, pap, and afa/dr adhesin-encoding genes were determined by using specific dna probes. no relationship was found between the adhesive pattern and the production of specific fimbriae, suggesting that several unrecognized adhesive factors are involved. our study indicates that special adhesive properties associated with resistance to antimicrobial agents could account for the pathogenicity of certain nosocomial strains.

AB  == an enzyme immunoassay for detection of bacterial antigens in urine specimens from urinary tract infections (uti) was developed. the antigens detected in infections by enterobacteriaceae: escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, and proteus sp.  were different from the enterobacterial common antigen (eca). they were digested  by trypsin and were characterized by remarkable thermostability; their molecular  weights were approximately 34,000 and 31,000. they were detected by means of antisera to eca or to suspension of e. coli. the frequency of positive results with urine specimens from enterobacterial uti was 87-99%. in contrast, the urine  specimens of uti by pseudomonas aeruginosa were positive in fewer than 20% with anti-e. coli sera, but were positive in more than 85% in tests with antiserum to  p. aeruginosa. the possible diagnostic application of the described tests was discussed.

TI  == in vitro susceptibility of bacteria to a ticarcillin-clavulanic acid combination.
AB  == in vitro testing of bacterial susceptibility to a combination of ticarcillin and  clavulanic acid was done, using 406 aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative isolates (considered to be pathogens) cultured from equine and small animal specimens. a microdilution broth technique of susceptibility testing was performed, using trays with wells containing a range of doubling concentrations of dehydrated ticarcillin (range, 0.50 to 128 micrograms/ml) with fixed concentration of clavulanic acid (4 micrograms/ml). the following isolates of equine origin were (90%) susceptible to concentrations of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid combinations of less than or equal to 16 and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively: staphylococcus aureus, s intermedius, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, ent agglomerans, ent cloacae, escherichia coli, actinobacillus sp, corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, rhodococcus equi, proteus  vulgaris, and bordetella bronchiseptica. isolates of small animal origin (90%) susceptible to less than or equal to 16 and 4 micrograms of ticarcillinclavulanic/ml included s aureus, s intermedius, ent aerogenes, ent agglomerans, pasteurella multocida, b bronchiseptica, pr mirabilis, and serratia  sp.

TI  == role of protozoa in microbial acclimation for mineralization of organic chemicals in sewage.
AB  == the role of protozoa in affecting the length of the acclimation period for the mineralization of organic compounds in sewage was investigated. the acclimation periods for the mineralization of 2 ng of p-nitrophenol, 100 ng of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, and 100 ng of 2,4-dichlorophenol per milliliter were markedly shortened or eliminated when the indigenous protozoa were inhibited with cycloheximide and nystatin. the extent of mineralization of the test compounds decreased when the protozoa were suppressed. inhibition of the protozoa increased the total number of bacteria and the density of organisms able to mineralize 2 ng of p-nitrophenol/ml of sewage. addition of tetrahymena thermophila to sewage in which the indigenous protozoa were not active lengthened the acclimation period for the mineralization of p-nitrophenol. the addition of t. thermophila to a culture containing a low density of a p-nitrophenol-degrading pseudomonas sp. did not affect the acclimation period prior to mineralization of  the substrate, but the ciliate increased the acclimation period in the presence of high densities of enterobacter aerogenes added as an alternative prey species. we suggest that protozoan grazing may be responsible for the acclimation period prior to the mineralization of certain organic compounds in sewage.

TI  == lipid a precursor from pseudomonas aeruginosa is completely acylated prior to addition of 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate.
AB  == inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (lps) synthesis in pseudomonas aeruginosa at the stage of incorporation of 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate (kdo) caused accumulation  of a lipid a precursor which contained all of the fatty acids present on the lipid a of mature lps. the enzyme ctp:cmp-3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate cytidylyltransferase (cmp-kdo synthetase) from p. aeruginosa is inhibited by the  kdo analog alpha-c-[1,5-anhydro-8-amino-2,7,8-trideoxy-d-manno-octopyranosyl] carboxylate (i), and i is effectively delivered to p. aeruginosa following attachment by amide linkage to the carboxyl terminus of alanylalanine. intracellular hydrolysis releases the free inhibitor (i) which then inhibits activation of kdo by cmp-kdo synthetase causing accumulation of lipid a precursor and subsequent growth stasis. the major lipid a precursor species accumulated was purified and found to contain glucosamine, phosphate, c12:o, 2oh-c12:o and 3oh-c10:0 (in ester linkage), and 3oh-c12:0 (in amide linkage) in molar ratios of 1:1:0.5:0.5:1:1. analysis of precursor by fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy yielded a major ion (m - h)- of mass 1616 and fragments which were consistent with the structure of lipid a from p. aeruginosa. in contrast, salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, citrobacter sp., serratia marcescens, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae all accumulated underacylated lipid a precursors which only contained 3-oh-c14:0, glucosamine, and phosphate. this difference and species-specific patterns of major and minor precursor species show that early steps in the assembly of lipid a are similar, but not identical in enteric and nonenteric gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility of clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in japan between  may, 1985 through march, 1986. these tests were organized by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. this paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of  clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, morganella  morganii, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (oflx) and conventional antibacterial drugs. the results obtained were  summarized as follows. 1. oflx showed strong antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, c. freundii, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and c. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to oflx. moreover, oflx has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. when studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, oflx occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. almost species from the  urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.

TI  == absence of a role for lytic microorganisms in the decline of bacteria andsaccharomyces introduced into soil.
AB  == the populations ofklebsieila pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, andpseudomonas sp. fell following their addition to soil, but species  lysing these gram-negative bacteria were not detected. the numbers ofstaphylococcus aureus andmicrococcus flavus fell by more than four orders of magnitude and ofsaccharomyces cerevisiae by more than two orders after their addition to soil. organisms lysing these gram-positive bacteria were present in soil, but their numbers did not increase as a result of the additions. lytic activity againsts. aureus was detected in soil filtrates, but this activity was not enhanced by inoculation of soil with the bacterium. addition of cycloheximide to soil suspensions delayed the fall in abundance ofm. flavus but did not suppress the lytic populations. we conclude that lysis is not responsible for the decline of bacteria ors. cerevisiae added to soil.

AB  == thirteen children with sickle cell disease were identified as having 14 episodes  of osteoarticular infection in a review of 27 years' experience. there were eight episodes of osteomyelitis or osteoarthritis and six of suppurative arthritis alone. the etiologic agents in osteomyelitis or osteoarthritis were salmonella sp in four cases, escherichia coli in one, enterobacter aerogenes in one, staphylococcus aureus in one, and haemophilus influenzae type b in one. five of the cases with infection limited to the joint were caused by streptococcus pneumoniae; the sixth was caused by h influenzae type b. fever (greater than or equal to 38.3 degrees c) was present in all children and the temperature was in excess of 39 degrees c in 62%. the mean duration of pain before admission was 4.5 days. the initial total white blood cell count ranged from 5,200 to 29,700/microl (mean 19,436/microl) and the total band neutrophil count ranged from 0 to 5,103/microl (mean 1,660/microl). the esr was greater than 20 mm/h in eight of the ten patients who were tested. management consisted of antibiotic therapy in all. needle aspiration was performed in two patients with osteomyelitis and in three with suppurative arthritis. incision and drainage was performed in two cases of osteomyelitis and in four with suppurative arthritis. the outcome was satisfactory in all except one patient who had several complications as a consequence of femoral neck osteomyelitis. recurrence was reported in only one patient.

TI  == bacterial growth rates and competition affect nodulation and root colonization by rhizobium meliloti.
AB  == the addition of streptomycin to nonsterile soil suppressed the numbers of bacterial cells in the rhizosphere of alfalfa (medicago sativa l.) for several days, resulted in the enhanced growth of a streptomycin-resistant strain of rhizobium meliloti, and increased the numbers of nodules on the alfalfa roots. a  bacterial mixture inoculated into sterile soil inhibited the colonization of alfalfa roots by r. meliloti, caused a diminution in the number of nodules, and reduced plant growth. enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas marginalis, acinetobacter sp., and klebsiella pneumoniae suppressed the colonization by r. meliloti of roots grown on agar and reduced nodulation by r. meliloti, the suppression of nodulation being statistically significant for the first three species. bradyrhizobium sp. and "sarcina lutea" did not suppress root colonization nor nodulation by r. meliloti. the doubling times in the rhizosphere for e. aerogenes, p. marginalis, acinetobacter sp., and k. pneumoniae were less and the doubling times for bradyrhizobium sp. and "s. lutea" were greater than the doubling time of r. meliloti. under the same conditions, arthrobacter citreus injured alfalfa roots. we suggest that competition by soil bacteria reduces nodulation by rhizobia in soil and that the extent of inhibition is related to the growth rates of the rhizosphere bacteria.

AB  == ciprofloxacin's in vitro activity was tested against 385 hospital isolates originating from three geographically distinct regions. of all strains tested, only three (1 acinetobacter sp. and 2 pseudomonas aeruginosa) were ciprofloxacin  resistant. ciprofloxacin was more active against escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, acinetobacter sp., proteus sp., shigella sp. than gentamicin, mezlocillin and cefotaxime. it was more active than azlocillin and cefsulodin against p. aeruginosa. it was more active than cloxacillin and cefamandole against staphylococci. it was as active as cefotaxime against klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens. ciprofloxacin demonstrated similar activity in broth and solid agar. the minimal  inhibitory concentrations (mic's) of all strains were similar to the minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbc's). ciprofloxacin's mic was not influenced by increase of the inoculum or addition of human serum and only slightly influenced  by anaerobic conditions. decrease of the medium ph increased the mic substantially. ciprofloxacin exhibited a rapid bactericidal effect and had only a minimal post-antibiotic effect. these favorable in vitro characteristics of ciprofloxacin warrant further studies.

AB  == twenty-three hg2+-resistant cultures were isolated from sediment of the savannah  river in georgia; of these, 14 were gram-negative short rods belonging to the genera escherichia and enterobacter, six were gram-positive cocci (three staphylococcus sp. and three streptococcus sp.) and three were bacillus sp. all the escherichia, enterobacter, and the bacillus strain were more resistant to hg2+ than the strains of staphylococci and streptococci. adaptation using serial  dilutions and concentration gradient agar plate techniques showed that it was possible to select a hg2+-resistant strain from a parent culture identified as enterobacter aerogenes. this culture resisted 1,200 mug of hg2+ per ml of medium  and produced methyl mercury from hgcl2, but was unable to convert hg2+ to volatile elemental mercury (hg0). under constant aeration (i.e., submerged culture), slightly more methyl mercury was formed than in the absence of aeration. production of methyl mercury was cyclic in nature and slightly decreased if dl-homocysteine was present in media, but increased with methylcobalamine. it is concluded that the bacterial production of methyl mercury may be a means of resistance and detoxification against mercurials in which inorganic hg2+ is converted to organic form and secreted into the environment.

TI  == susceptibilities of gram-negative bacteria to combinations of antimicrobial agents in vitro.
AB  == combinations of either clindamycin or erythromycin with gentamicin, colimycin, or carbenicillin were studied for their antimicrobial effects on clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, enterobacter aerogenes, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. no antagonistic effects of the antibiotic combinations were observed. synergistic effects of the antibiotic  combinations were noted against most strains of e. coli tested, especially when either clindamycin or erythromycin was combined with gentamicin or colimycin. of  16 other combinations of antibiotics examined with strains of e. coli as the test organisms, only the combination of penicillin g with either gentamicin or colimycin showed consistent synergy. the marked synergy of clindamycin combined with either gentamicin or colimycin was further demonstrated by following the kinetics of the bactericidal action of the antibiotic combinations and the effects on bacterial protein synthesis.

TI  == evaluation of radiometric system for detecting bacteremia.
AB  == an automated radiometric system (bactec, johnston laboratories) for detection of  bacteremia was evaluated in parallel with a standard blood culture system in use  in our laboratory. of 1,445 blood cultures from 484 patients with possible bacteremia, 106 sets of cultures (excluding 39 presumed contaminated), representing 56 patients, were positive by both methods. the conventional system  yielded 85 positive cultures from 48 patients, whereas the bactec system yielded  84 positive cultures from 43 patients. the bactec system failed to detect 22 cultures that were positive in the conventional system, and the conventional system failed to detect 21 cultures that were positive in the bactec system. the  detection efficiency was generally equivalent in the two systems except for the lower detection rates of anaerobes and enterobacter aerogenes by the bactec system and the lower detection rates of torulopsis glabrata and, possibly, pseudomonas sp. (group ivd) in the conventional system. the bactec system had a slight advantage over the conventional system in the time interval to detection of positivity. approximately 20% of the positive cultures detected by the bactec  system were detected on the first day of incubation compared with 7% by the conventional system. the recovery rates and detection times of anaerobes were less efficient by the bactec system than by the conventional system. it does not  appear that the radiometric method has much advantage over available conventional methods.

TI  == degradation of uric acid by certain aerobic bacteria.
AB  == we have isolated and identified nine cultures of aerobic bacteria capable of growing on an elective medium containing uric acid as the only source of carbon,  nitrogen, and energy. four of these cultures were identified as aerobacter aerogenes, two as klebsiella pneumoniae, and the remainder as serratia killiensis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacillus species. another culture identified as p. fluorescens required both glucose and uric acid for growth. when 23 laboratory stock cultures were inoculated into the uric acid medium, a. aerogenes, b. subtilis, mycobacterium phlei, p. aeruginosa, and s. marcescens were able to grow. these five cultures also grew when the uric acid was replaced  with adenine, guanine, hypoxanthine, xanthine, or allantoin, but growth was poor. in all of these media, including the uric acid medium, addition of glucose along  with the nitrogenous compounds yielded good growth. induction experiments demonstrated that the ability of a. aerogenes, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, p. fluorescens, s. kiliensis, s. marcescens, b. subtilis, and bacillus sp. to degrade uric acid is an induced property. of these organisms, only bacillus sp. accumulated a small amount of intracellular uric acid.

TI  == effect of coliform and proteus bacteria on growth of staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == cultures of coliform and proteus bacteria, mostly from foods, were tested for their effect on growth of staphylococcus aureus in trypticase soy broth. inhibition of the staphylococcus by these competitors increased with increasing proportions of inhibiting (effector) bacteria in the inoculum and decreasing incubation temperatures (37 to 10 c). time required for 2 x 10(4) staphylococci to increase to 5 x 10(6) cells per milliliter, the minimal number assumed to be necessary for food poisoning, varied with the species of effector, the original ratio of effector bacteria to staphylococci in the medium, and the incubation temperature. when the original ratio was 100:1, the staphylococci did not reach 5 x 10(6) cells per milliliter at 10, 15, 22, or 30 c (with one exception), when growing with cultures representing six species of coliform bacteria and two of proteus. when the ratio was 1:1, all effectors either greatly delayed the staphylococcus or prevented it from reaching hazardous numbers at 15 c, six of the eight caused a delay of 2 to 3 hr at 22 c, and only escherichia coli delayed  the coccus at 30 c. all effectors were ineffective at 22 and 30 c when original numbers of effectors and staphylococci were in the ratio 1:100. greatest overall  inhibition was by e. coli, e. freundii, and proteus vulgaris, and these species were more effective than the others at 22 and 30 c. aerobacter cloacae and paracolobactrum aerogenoides were more effective at 15 c. in general, results were similar with different strains of a species. except for aerobacter aerogenes, klebsiella sp., and p. aerogenoides, which apparently did not compete  for nutrients, inhibition of the staphylococcus was by a combination of antibiotic substances and competition for nutrients.

TI  == repression of staphylococcus aureus by food bacteria. ii. causes of inhibition.
AB  == two food bacteria, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas sp. cs-1, inhibited an enterotoxigenic strain of staphylococcus aureus, apparently by out-competing it for nutrients. five others, bacillus cereus, proteus vulgaris, escherichia coli h-52, aerobacter aerogenes, and achromobacter sp., inhibited by means of antibiotic substances which were seitz-filterable, dialyzable, and stable at 90 c for 10 min. inhibition was not caused by changes in ph, oxidation-reduction potential, or production of peroxide or fatty acids. the concentrated antibiotic  material from e. coli h-52 contained amino acids but not peptides and was especially effective against staphylococci and micrococci.
