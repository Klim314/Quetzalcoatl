TI  == antimicrobial activities of various fractions of longan (dimocarpus longan lour.  fen ke) seed extract.
AB  == the antimicrobial activities of longan (dimocarpus longan lour. fen ke) seed extracts were investigated using a disc diffusion method and also determining the minimal inhibitory concentration. the dl-p01-si01 fraction showed that the strongest activity against staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant s. aureus at mic 64 mug/ml, which was found to be due to the phenolic compounds. the hplc analysis showed that the major phenolic compounds are gallic acid, corilagin, ethyl gallate and ellagic acid.

TI  == rapid systemic and local treatments with the antibacterial peptide dimer a3-apo and its monomeric metabolite eliminate bacteria and reduce inflammation in intradermal lesions infected with propionibacterium acnes and meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == when administered intramuscularly, the designer antibacterial peptide dimer a3-apo is highly efficacious in mouse models of acinetobacter baumannii and staphylococcus aureus burn infections. here we compared the efficacy of a3-apo and its monomeric metabolite in mouse models of s. aureus and propionibacterium acnes intradermal infections following administration as intramuscular (i.m.) or  topical treatments. in the animal models, either (i) the ears of cd-1 mice were infected with p. acnes or (ii) s. aureus was injected into burn wounds inflicted  to the back. a3-apo or the monomer were injected intramuscularly at 5 mg/kg one to three times or were applied three times as 1% local treatment in phosphate-buffered saline or vaseline((r)). despite being inactive against the strains in vitro, in vivo the skin conditions of the mice were dramatically improved upon peptide treatment regardless of dosing frequency, administration mode or drug valency. in the p. acnes study, a3-apo statistically significantly reduced ear thickness and ear bacterial counts. the amount of ear connective tissue and epithelial macrophages correlated with therapeutic success. bacterial  load in the lesions was more representative of physical improvement than ear dimensions. in the s. aureus model, both peptides eliminated wound bacteria from  >10(7) cfu/mg to almost background levels, with monomer treatment being somewhat  more successful. in conclusion, a3-apo and its monomeric metabolite very efficiently ameliorate resistant aerobic and anaerobic intradermal infections, but the protection is apparently not due to direct bacterial killing. immunostimulatory and anti-inflammatory actions are likely involved. nevertheless, topical and i.m. administrations are equally effective.

TI  == suppuration-associated bacteria in patients with chronic and aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: suppuration (sup) on probing may be an indication of active periodontal breakdown. the aim of the present study is to analyze which subgingival species are associated with sup in patients with chronic (cp) and aggressive (agp) periodontitis. methods: a total of 156 patients with cp and 66 with agp were submitted to full-mouth periodontal examination and subgingival biofilm sampling (14 sites/patient). the counts of 44 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard. comparisons between groups and sites were analyzed by the mann-whitney and wilcoxon tests, respectively. associations between frequency of sup and bacterial species were analyzed by the spearman correlation coefficient. results: the prevalence of sup in patients with cp was 24.4%, and in patients with agp it was 30.3%, and the percentage of sup sites in the groups was 5.72% +/- 1.06% and 6.96% +/- 1.70%, respectively (p >0.05). sup sites from patients with cp had significantly higher counts of veillonella parvula, dialister pneumosintes, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella nigrescens than sup  sites from patients with agp (p <0.005). significant positive correlations between high frequency of sup and high levels of actinomyces spp, streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were observed in patients with cp (p <0.05). in patients with agp, actinomyces oris, propionibacterium acnes, p. aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  and streptococcus sanguinis were positively associated with sup, whereas prevotella intermedia presented a negative association with sup (p <0.05). conclusions: sup sites from patients with cp harbored significantly higher counts of several periodontal species than sup sites from patients with agp. actinomyces spp., streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, t. forsythia, and certain non-oral pathogens were associated with a high number of sites with sup.

TI  == [clinical relevance of time-to-positivity in bactec9240 blood culture system].
AB  == background: continuous monitoring systems have allowed determination of the time-to-positivity (ttp). we evaluated the clinical relevance of ttp in the bactec9240 system (becton-dickinson, usa). methods: a total of 2,354 vials of positive blood cultures were evaluated over 2 months. ttp was monitored from each of bactec plus aerobic/f (bd) or pediatric plus/f and lytic anaerobic/f bottles,  and the differential time-to-positivity (dtp) for blood samples drawn simultaneously via catheter and a peripheral site was determined. results: the average ttp of the positive vials was 17.4 hr, and 79.9% and 95.2% of the vials showed positivity within 24 and 48 hr, respectively. while the average ttp values for aeromonas hydrophila, bacillus cereus, acinetobacter baumannii, and streptococcus pneumoniae were less than 10 hr, those for candida spp., anaerobes, propionibacterium acnes, corynebacterium spp, bacillus spp. other than cereus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci were 35.3, 27.0, 56.8, 45.8, 23.0, and 26.3  hr, respectively. the negative predictive values of ttp over 24 hr to predict staphylococcus aureus among staphylococci and s. pneumoniae among alpha-hemolytic streptococci were 76.7% and 100%, respectively. enterobacteriaceae and enterococcus faecalis showed shorter ttp in anaerobic vials than in aerobic vials. dtp of more than 2 hr was observed for 27.8%, 72.2%, and 45.5% of s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and candida spp. conclusions: ttp can be used to discriminate pathogens and contaminants. the shorter ttp in anaerobic vials of certain enterobacteriaceae and enterococcus spp. would facilitate further identification. dtp is useful for diagnosing catheter-related bloodstream infection by s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and candida spp.

TI  == sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles in the detection of cornea organ culture media contamination by bacteria and fungi.
AB  == aims: to test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. methods: the bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 iu/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin b was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees c with five inocula of 14 bacteria. two yeasts  (candida spp) and one aspergillus were also tested. contaminated media were then  inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened  daily by visual inspection. the sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. results: organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria  irrespective of the starting inoculums: streptococcus pneumoniae, branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, propionibacterium acnes, and haemophilus influenzae. for micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal  only (methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, bacillus subtilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans, candida kruzei, aspergillus  fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (sd 13.8, range 2-52). in cases of detection by the  blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. conclusions: blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.
