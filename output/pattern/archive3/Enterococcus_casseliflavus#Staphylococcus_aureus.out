assessment of safe enterococci as bioprotective cultures in low-acid fermented sausages combined with high hydrostatic pressure.
three bacteriocinogenic, non-aminogenic and non-virulent enterococcus strains (enterococcus faecium ctc8005, enterococcus devriesei ctc8006 and enterococcus casseliflavus ctc8003) were used as starter cultures in low-acid fermented sausages to assess their competitiveness and their bioprotective potential against listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus. the inoculated strains were successfully monitored by rapd-pcr. all the strains were able to grow, survive and dominate the endogenous enterococci population and avoided the growth of enterobacteriaceae. e. devriesei ctc8006 and e. faecium ctc8005 particularly inhibited the growth of l. monocytogenes during the whole ripening process. s. aureus was not affected by the inoculated bacteriocinogenic enterococci strains. the application of high hydrostatic pressure (hhp) treatment (600 mpa for 5 min) at the end of ripening (day 21) produced an immediate reduction in the counts of enterobacteriaceae to levels <1 log cfu/g and promoted a decrease of 1-log unit in the counts of s. aureus. e. faecium ctc8005, which reduced the counts of l. monocytogenes ca. 2 log cfu/g immediately after stuffing and in combination with hhp treatment promoted a further reduction of 1 log cfu/g in the pathogen counts. the combination of e. faecium ctc8005 and hhp was the most efficient antilisterial approach.
first detection of the staphylococcal trimethoprim resistance gene dfrk and the dfrk-carrying transposon tn559 in enterococci.
the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrk has been recently described in staphylococcus aureus, but so far has not been found in other bacteria. a total of 166 enterococci of different species (e. faecium, e. faecalis, e. hirae, e. durans, e. gallinarum, and e. casseliflavus) and origins (food, clinical diseases in humans, healthy humans or animals, and sewage) were studied for their susceptibility to trimethoprim as determined by agar dilution (european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing) and the presence of (a) the dfrk gene and its genetic environment and (b) other dfr genes. the dfrk gene was detected in 49% of the enterococci (64% and 42% of isolates with minimum inhibitory concentrations of >/=2 mg/l or </=1 mg/l, respectively). the tet(l)-dfrk linkage was detected in 21% of dfrk-positive enterococci. the chromosomal location of the dfrk gene was identified in one e. faecium isolate in which the dfrk was not linked to tet(l) gene but was part of a tn559 element, which was integrated in the chromosomal radc gene. this tn559 element was also found in 14 additional isolates. all combinations of dfr genes were detected among the isolates tested (dfrk, dfrg, dfrf, dfrk+dfrg, dfrk+dfrf, dfrf+dfrg, and dfrf+dfrg+dfrk). the gene dfrk gene was found together with other dfr genes in 58% of the tested enterococci. this study suggested an exchange of the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrk between enterococci and staphylococci, as previously observed for the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrg.
semisynthetic glycopeptide antibiotics derived from ly264826 active against vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
certain derivatives of the glycopeptide antibiotic ly264826 with n-alkyl-linked substitutions on the epivancosamine sugar are active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci. six compounds representing our most active series were evaluated for activity against antibiotic-resistant, gram-positive pathogens. for enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis resistant to both vancomycin and teicoplanin, the mics of the six semisynthetic compounds for 90% of the strains tested were 1 to 4 micrograms/ml, compared with 2,048 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 256 micrograms/ml for ly264826. for e. faecium and e. faecalis resistant to vancomycin but not teicoplanin, the mics were 0.016 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 64 to 1,024 micrograms/ml for vancomycin. the compounds were highly active against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci and against e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus and showed some activity against isolates of highly vancomycin-resistant leuconostocs and pediococci. the mics for 90% of the strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus tested were typically 0.25 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 microgram/ml for vancomycin. against methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis mics ranged from 0.25 to 2 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 to 4 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 4 to 16 micrograms/ml for teicoplanin. the spectrum of these new compounds included activity against teicoplanin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci. the compounds exhibited exceptional potency against pathogenic streptococci, with mics of < or = 0.008 microgram/ml against streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant isolates. in in vivo studies with a mouse infection model, the median effective doses against a challenge by s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, or s. pyogenes were typically 4 to 20 times lower than those of vancomycin. overall, these new glycopeptides, such as ly307599 and ly333328, show promise for use as agents against resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci.
