TI  == assessment of species and antimicrobial resistance among enterobacteriaceae isolated from mallard duck faeces.
AB  == mallard ducks have demonstrated to be a likely reservoir for zoonotic e. coli strains; thus, it is possible that these ducks could also act as a reservoir for  other enterobacteriaceae members. the present study was initiated to evaluate the species distribution of enterobacteriaceae other than e. coli in 175 fresh faecal samples collected from a population of mallard ducks. sixty-four samples displayed detectable colonies of enterobacteriaceae (excluding e. coli), which resulted in 75 pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) types. seventy-five single representatives of each pfge type were subjected to identification with api 32ne  and maldi tof ms systems due to the practical difficulties in species differentiation of enterobacteriaceae. those isolated were found to be from nine  genera: buttiauxella (15 %), citrobacter (5 %), enterobacter (32 %), hafnia (1 %), leclercia (1 %), pantoea (7 %), raoultella (21 %), rahnella (7 %) and serratia (11 %). evaluation of antimicrobial resistance phenotypes using the disc method and detection of resistance genes using the microarray method revealed that these microbes possess resistance to beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, macrolides, quinolones, rifamycine, sulphonamides, streptogramins and diaminopyrimidines. in conclusion, mallard ducks harbour a variety of non-pathogenic and pathogenic enterobacteriaceae species like enterobacter cloacae and enterobacter amnigenus in their intestine and could act as a reservoir of resistant enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == effects of ensiling fermentation and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community in italian ryegrass, guinea grass, and whole-crop maize silages stored  at high moisture content.
AB  == the effects of storage period and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community were examined in italian ryegrass (ir), guinea grass (gg), and whole-crop maize (wm) silages. direct-cut forages were stored in a laboratory silo for 3, 7, 14, 28, 56, and 120 d without any additives; live counts, content  of fermentation products, and characteristics of the bacterial community were determined. 2,3-butanediol, acetic acid, and lactic acid were the dominant fermentation products in the ir, gg, and wm silages, respectively. the acetic acid content increased as a result of prolonged ensiling, regardless of the type  of silage crop, and the changes were distinctively visible from the beginning of  gg ensiling. pantoea agglomerans, rahnella aquatilis, and enterobacter sp. were the major bacteria in the ir silage, indicating that alcoholic fermentation may be due to the activity of enterobacteria. staphylococcus sciuri and bacillus pumilus were detected when ir silage was spoiled, whereas between aerobically stable and unstable silages, no differences were seen in the bacterial community  at silo opening. lactococcus lactis was a representative bacterium, although acetic acid was the major fermentation product in the gg silage. lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, and morganella morganii were suggested to be associated with the increase in acetic acid due to prolonged storage. enterobacter cloacae appeared when the gg silage was spoiled. in the wm silage, no distinctive changes due to prolonged ensiling were seen in the bacterial community. throughout the ensiling, weissella paramesenteroides, weissella confusa, and klebsiella pneumoniae were present in addition to l. plantarum, l. brevis, and l. lactis. upon deterioration, acetobacter pasteurianus, klebsiella variicola, enterobacter hormaechei, and bacillus gibsonii were detected. these results demonstrate the diverse bacterial community that evolves during ensiling  and aerobic spoilage of ir, gg, and wm silages.

TI  == production of biogenic amines "in vitro" in relation to the growth phase by enterobacteriaceae species isolated from traditional sausages.
AB  == histidine, lysine, ornithine and tyrosine decarboxylase activities were tested in 79 strains of enterobacteriaceae (41 of hafnia alvei, 17 of serratia liquefaciens, 5 of enterobacter cloacae, 4 of citrobacter braakii, 2 of proteus vulgaris, 2 of proteus mirabilis, 2 of providencia stuartii, 2 of klebsiella terrigena, 1 of rahnella aquatilis, 1 of salmonella arizonae, 1 of citrobacter youngae and 1 of escherichia coli) isolated from botillo, a spanish traditional sausage. in general, the strains were positive for all four activities, with the  exception of two strains of h. alvei and the e. coli strain, which did not display histidine decarboxylase activity. the strains of p. mirabilis and p. stuartii did not exhibit any of the four activities tested. accumulation of putrescine and cadaverine was studied throughout growth of the 75 strains that displayed ornithine and lysine decarboxylase activities. biogenic amines were produced particularly in the exponential phase, with maximum accumulation occurring after between 12 to 72 h, depending on the biogenic amine and microbial species considered. maximum accumulation of putrescine varied greatly between species and within the same species, and ranged from 18 mg/l in the r. aquatilis  strain to 7325 mg/l in a h. alvei strain. maximum accumulation of cadaverine varied less than that of putrescine, and ranged from 30 mg/l in the r. aquatilis  strain to 1935 mg/l in a s. liquefaciens strain.

TI  == gram-negative bacteria from the camel tick hyalomma dromedarii (ixodidae) and the chicken tick argas persicus (argasidae) and their antibiotic sensitivities.
AB  == a total of nine species of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from organs and haemolymph of the hard tick hyalomma (hyalomma) dromedarii and the soft tick argas (persicargas) persicus. four species namely serratia liquefaciens, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, klebsiella ornithinolytica and aeromonas hydrophila were isolated from h. dromedarii and five species namely rahnella aquatilis, pseudomonas fluorescens, enterobacter cloacae, chryseomonas luteola and chryseobacterium meningosepticum were isolated from a. persicus. isolated bacteria were identified using the analytical profile index 20e. disk diffusion test was carried out on all isolated bacteria to determine antibiotic sensitivity of chloramphenicol, amoxillin/clavulanic acid, neomycin, streptomycin, triplesulphur tetracycline and nitrofurantion. the results were discussed.

TI  == identification by 16s ribosomal rna gene sequencing of an enterobacteriaceae species with ambiguous biochemical profile from a renal transplant recipient.
AB  == traditional ways of identification of bacteria by phenotypic characteristics cannot be used for non-cultivable organisms and organisms with unusual biochemical profiles. in this study, an enterobacteriaceae was isolated in pure growth from the mid-stream urine of a 67-year old renal transplant recipient with urinary tract infection. conventional biochemical tests did not reveal a pattern  resembling any known member of the enterobacteriaceae family. the vitek system (gni+) showed that it was 18% leclercia adecarboxylata and 55% klebsiella ozaenae; whereas the api system (20e) showed that it was 99.8% rahnella aquatilis. 16s ribosomal rna gene sequencing showed that there was 7 base differences between the isolate and enterobacter cloacae, 18 base differences between the isolate and enterobacter asburiae, 17 base differences between the isolate and enterobacter cancerogenus, 35 base differences between the isolate and k. ozaenae, 27 base differences between the isolate and l. adecarboxylata, and 72 base differences between the isolate and r. aquatilis, indicating that the isolate most closely resembled a strain of e. cloacae. identification of the organism in this study is important, as the choice of antibiotics would be radically different. in this case, cephalosporins should be avoided regardless of in-vitro susceptibility as cephalosporins are well-known to select for ampc derepressed mutants in enterobacter, and previous administration of third-generation cephalosporins is more likely to be associated with multidrug resistant enterobacter isolates than is administration of antibiotics that do not include a third-generation cephalosporin.

TI  == identification of bacterial isolates obtained from intestinal contents associated with 12,000-year-old mastodon remains.
AB  == mastodon (mammut americanum) remains unearthed during excavation of ancient sediments usually consist only of skeletal material, due to postmortem decomposition of soft tissues by microorganisms. two recent excavations of skeletal remains in anoxic sediments in ohio and michigan, however, have uncovered organic masses which appear to be remnants of the small and large intestines, respectively. macrobotanical examinations of the composition of these masses revealed assemblages of plant material radiocarbon dated to approximately  11,500 years before the present and thought to be incompletely digested food remains from this extinct mammal. we attempted to cultivate and identify bacteria from the intestinal contents, bone-associated sediments, and sediments not in proximity to the remains using a variety of general and selective media. in all,  295 isolates were cultivated, and 38 individual taxa were identified by fatty acid-methyl ester (fame) profiles and biochemical characteristics (api-20e). the  taxonomic positions of selected enteric and obligately anaerobic bacteria were confirmed by 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) sequencing. results indicate that the intestinal and bone-associated samples contained the greatest diversity of bacterial taxa and that members of the family enterobacteriaceae represented 41%  of all isolates and were predominant in the intestinal masses and sediments in proximity to the skeleton but were uncommon in the background sediments. enterobacter cloacae was the most commonly identified isolate, and partial rdna sequencing revealed that rahnella aquatilis was the correct identity of strains suggested by fame profiles to be yersinia enterocolitica. no bacteroides spp. or  expected intestinal anaerobes were recovered. the only obligate anaerobes recovered were clostridia, and these were not recovered from the small intestinal masses. microbiological evidence from this study supports other, macrobotanical data indicating the intestinal origin of these masses. whether these organisms are direct descendants of the original intestinal microbiota, however, cannot be  established.

TI  == [rahnella aquatilis, a new member of the enterobacteriaceae (author's transl)].
AB  == a dna-dna hybridization study was carried out to determine the taxonomic position of a new group of enterobacteria (group h2) previously studied by numerical taxonomy. all the strains of this group revealed relatively high reassociation binding ratios with the centrotype; 82% of the strains of the group showed more than 69% of reassociation with the centrotype. in spite of numerical taxonomy conclusions, there was no genetic relationship with the species enterobacter cloacae (higher reassociation binding ratio: 37%). no significant genetic relationship with the other groups of enterobacteria was found. rahnella aquatilis was defined from phenotypic and genetic data. the strain 133 (cip 78-65) is proposed as type strain of the species.
