TI  - Cloning, purification, crystallization and 1.57 A resolution X-ray data analysis  of AmsI, the tyrosine phosphatase controlling amylovoran biosynthesis in the plant pathogen Erwinia amylovora.
AB  - The Gram-negative bacterium Erwinia amylovora is a destructive pathogen of plants belonging to the Rosaceae family. Amongst its pathogenicity factors, E. amylovora produces the exopolysaccharide amylovoran, which contributes to the occlusion of plant vessels, causing wilting of shoots and eventually resulting in plant death. Amylovoran biosynthesis requires the presence of 12 genes (from amsA to amsL) clustered in the ams region of the E. amylovora genome. They mostly encode glycosyl transferases (AmsG, AmsB, AmsD, AmsE, AmsJ and AmsK), proteins involved in amylovoran translocation and assembly (AmsH, AmsL and AmsC), and also a tyrosine kinase (AmsA) and a tyrosine phosphatase (AmsI), which are both involved in the regulation of amylovoran biosynthesis. The low-molecular-weight protein tyrosine phosphatase AmsI was overexpressed as a His6-tagged protein in Escherichia coli, purified and crystallized. X-ray diffraction data were collected to a maximum resolution of 1.57 A in space group P3121.
TI  - Expression, purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GalU) from Erwinia amylovora.
AB  - Glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase from Erwinia amylovora CFPB1430 was expressed as a His-tag fusion protein in Escherichia coli. After tag removal, the purified protein was crystallized from 100 mM Tris pH 8.5, 2 M ammonium sulfate, 5% ethylene glycol. Diffraction data sets were collected to a maximum resolution of 2.46 A using synchrotron radiation. The crystals belonged to the hexagonal space group P62, with unit-cell parameters a = 80.67, b = 80.67, c = 169.18. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the structure of the E. coli enzyme as a search model.
TI  - Acetyl coenzyme A synthetase is acetylated on multiple lysine residues by a protein acetyltransferase with a single Gcn5-type N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) domain in Saccharopolyspora erythraea.
AB  - Reversible lysine acetylation (RLA) is used by cells of all domains of life to modulate protein function. To date, bacterial acetylation/deacetylation systems have been studied in a few bacteria (e.g., Salmonella enterica, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Erwinia amylovora, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Geobacillus kaustophilus), but little is known about RLA in antibiotic-producing actinomycetes. Here, we identify the Gcn5-like protein acetyltransferase AcuA of Saccharopolyspora erythraea (SacAcuA, SACE_5148) as the enzyme responsible for the acetylation of the AMP-forming acetyl coenzyme A synthetase (SacAcsA, SACE_2375). Acetylated SacAcsA was deacetylated by a sirtuin-type NAD(+)-dependent consuming deacetylase (SacSrtN, SACE_3798). In vitro acetylation/deacetylation of SacAcsA enzyme was studied by Western blotting, and acetylation of lysine residues Lys(237), Lys(380), Lys(611), and Lys(628) was confirmed by mass spectrometry. In a strain devoid of SacAcuA, none of the above-mentioned Lys residues of SacAcsA was acetylated. To our knowledge, the ability of SacAcuA to acetylate multiple Lys residues is unique among AcuA-type acetyltransferases. Results from site-specific mutagenesis experiments showed that the activity of SacAcsA was controlled by lysine acetylation. Lastly, immunoprecipitation data showed that in vivo acetylation of SacAcsA was influenced by glucose and acetate availability. These results suggested that reversible acetylation may also be a conserved regulatory posttranslational modification strategy in antibiotic-producing actinomycetes.
TI  - AraC/XylS family stress response regulators Rob, SoxS, PliA, and OpiA in the fire blight pathogen Erwinia amylovora.
AB  - Transcriptional regulators of the AraC/XylS family have been associated with multidrug resistance, organic solvent tolerance, oxidative stress, and virulence in clinically relevant enterobacteria. In the present study, we identified four homologous AraC/XylS regulators, Rob, SoxS, PliA, and OpiA, from the fire blight pathogen Erwinia amylovora Ea1189. Previous studies have shown that the regulators MarA, Rob, and SoxS from Escherichia coli mediate multiple-antibiotic resistance, primarily by upregulating the AcrAB-TolC efflux system. However, none of the four AraC/XylS regulators from E. amylovora was able to induce a multidrug resistance phenotype in the plant pathogen. Overexpression of rob led to a 2-fold increased expression of the acrA gene. However, the rob-overexpressing strain showed increased resistance to only a limited number of antibiotics. Furthermore, Rob was able to induce tolerance to organic solvents in E. amylovora by mechanisms other than efflux. We demonstrated that SoxS from E. amylovora is involved in superoxide resistance. A soxS-deficient mutant of Ea1189 was not able to grow on agar plates supplemented with the superoxide-generating agent paraquat. Furthermore, expression of soxS was induced by redox cycling agents. We identified two novel members of the AraC/XylS family in E. amylovora. PliA was highly upregulated during the early infection phase in apple rootstock and immature pear fruits. Multiple compounds were able to induce the expression of pliA, including apple leaf extracts, phenolic compounds, redox cycling agents, heavy metals, and decanoate. OpiA was shown to play a role in the regulation of osmotic and alkaline pH stress responses.
TI  - Identification and genetics of 6-thioguanine secreted by Erwinia species and its  interference with the growth of other bacteria.
AB  - We identified a compound in culture supernatants of Erwinia species, such as Erwinia amylovora, E. pyrifoliae, E. billingiae, E. tasmaniensis, E. persicina and E. rhapontici absorbing at 340 nm, which was associated before with the yellow pigment produced by E. amylovora on media containing copper ions. The compound was purified from E. tasmaniensis strain Et1/99 supernatants by chromatography on Dowex-1 and Dowex-50 columns and identified by HPLC/MS and NMR analysis as 6-thioguanine (6TG). Its signal at 167 Da matched with the expected molecular mass. By random mutagenesis with miniTn5, we obtained mutants defective in the genes for pyrimidine and purine metabolism. A specific gene cluster with ycf genes described by us before, absent in the corresponding region of Escherichia coli, was identified in the genome sequence of three Erwinia species and named tgs region for thioguanine synthesis. Clones of the tgs gene cluster promoted 6TG synthesis and secretion in E. coli, when the bacteria were grown in minimal medium supplemented with amino acids. 6TG was bacteriostatic for E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium strains, with cell growth resumed after prolonged incubation. Similar results were obtained with P. agglomerans strains. Bacteria from the genus Pectobacterium were barely and Rahnella or Gibbsiella species were not inhibited by 6TG. Adenine and guanine relieved the toxic effect of 6TG on E. coli. Non-producing strains were fully virulent on host plants. 6TG synthesis may help erwinias to interfere with growth of some microorganisms in the environment.
TI  - Biomolecular characterization of the levansucrase of Erwinia amylovora, a promising biocatalyst for the synthesis of fructooligosaccharides.
AB  - Erwinia amylovora is a plant pathogen that affects Rosaceae, such as apple and pear. In E. amylovora the fructans, produced by the action of a levansucrase (EaLsc), play a role in virulence and biofilm formation. Fructans are bioactive compounds, displaying health-promoting properties in their own right. Their use as food and feed supplements is increasing. In this study, we investigated the biomolecular properties of EaLsc using HPAEC-PAD, MALDI-TOF MS, and spectrophotometric assays. The enzyme, which was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli in high yield, was shown to produce mainly fructooligosaccharides (FOSs) with a degree of polymerization between 3 and 6. The kinetic properties of EaLsc were similar to those of other phylogenetically related Gram-negative bacteria, but the good yield of FOSs, the product spectrum, and the straightforward production of the enzyme suggest that EaLsc is an interesting biocatalyst for future studies aimed at producing tailor-made fructans.
TI  - The tail-associated depolymerase of Erwinia amylovora phage L1 mediates host cell adsorption and enzymatic capsule removal, which can enhance infection by other phage.
AB  - The depolymerase enzyme (DpoL1) encoded by the T7-like phage L1 efficiently degrades amylovoran, an important virulence factor and major component of the extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) of its host, the plant pathogen Erwinia amylovora. Mass spectrometry analysis of hydrolysed EPS revealed that DpoL1 cleaves the galactose-containing backbone of amylovoran. The enzyme is most active at pH 6 and 50 degrees C, and features a modular architecture. Removal of 180 N-terminal amino acids was shown not to affect enzyme activity. The C-terminus harbours the hydrolase activity, while the N-terminal domain links the enzyme to the phage particle. Electron microscopy demonstrated that DpoL1-specific antibodies cross-link phage particles at their tails, either lateral or frontal, and immunogold staining confirmed that DpoL1 is located at the tail spikes. Exposure of high-level EPS-producing Er. amylovora strain CFBP1430 to recombinant DpoL1 dramatically increased sensitivity to the Dpo-negative phage Y2, which was not the case for EPS-negative mutants or low-level EPS-producing Er. amylovora. Our findings indicate that enhanced phage susceptibility is based on enzymatic removal of the EPS capsule, normally a physical barrier to Y2 infection, and that use of DpoL1 together with the broad host range, virulent phage Y2 represents an attractive combination for biocontrol of fire blight.
TI  - Cloning, expression, purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of EaLsc, a levansucrase from Erwinia amylovora.
AB  - The Gram-negative bacterium Erwinia amylovora is a destructive pathogen of Rosaceae. During infection, E. amylovora produces the exopolysaccharide levan, which contributes to the occlusion of plant vessels, causing the wilting of shoots. Levan is a fructose polymer that is synthesized by multifunctional enzymes called levansucrases. The levansucrase from E. amylovora (EaLsc) was heterologously expressed as a GST-fusion protein in Escherichia coli, purified and crystallized after tag removal. The protein crystallized in space group P21212. X-ray diffraction data were acquired to 2.77 A resolution. The structure of the enzyme was solved by molecular replacement. The asymmetric unit contains eight enzyme molecules, giving a solvent content of 58.74% and a Matthews coefficient of 2.98 A(3) Da(-1).
TI  - Cyclic Di-GMP modulates the disease progression of Erwinia amylovora.
AB  - The second messenger cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) is a nearly ubiquitous intracellular signal molecule known to regulate various cellular processes, including biofilm formation, motility, and virulence. The intracellular concentration of c-di-GMP is inversely governed by diguanylate cyclase (DGC) enzymes and phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes, which synthesize and degrade c-di-GMP, respectively. The role of c-di-GMP in the plant pathogen and causal agent of fire blight disease Erwinia amylovora has not been studied previously. Here we demonstrate that three of the five predicted DGC genes in E. amylovora (edc genes, for Erwinia diguanylate cyclase), edcA, edcC, and edcE, are active diguanylate cyclases. We show that c-di-GMP positively regulates the secretion of the main exopolysaccharide in E. amylovora, amylovoran, leading to increased biofilm formation, and negatively regulates flagellar swimming motility. Although amylovoran secretion and biofilm formation are important for the colonization of plant xylem tissues and the development of systemic infections, deletion of the two biofilm-promoting DGCs increased tissue necrosis in an immature-pear infection assay and an apple shoot infection model, suggesting that c-di-GMP negatively regulates virulence. In addition, c-di-GMP inhibited the expression of hrpA, a gene encoding the major structural component of the type III secretion pilus. Our results are the first to describe a role for c-di-GMP in E. amylovora and suggest that downregulation of motility and type III secretion by c-di-GMP during infection plays a key role in the coordination of pathogenesis.
TI  - AmyR is a novel negative regulator of amylovoran production in Erwinia amylovora.
AB  - In this study, we attempted to understand the role of an orphan gene amyR in Erwinia amylovora, a functionally conserved ortholog of ybjN in Escherichia coli, which has recently been characterized. Amylovoran, a high molecular weight acidic heteropolymer exopolysaccharide, is a virulent factor of E. amylovora. As reported earlier, amylovoran production in an amyR knockout mutant was about eight-fold higher than that in the wild type (WT) strain of E. amylovora. When a multicopy plasmid containing the amyR gene was introduced into the amyR mutant or WT strains, amylovoran production was strongly inhibited. Furthermore, amylovoran production was also suppressed in various amylovoran-over-producing mutants, such as grrSA containing multicopies of the amyR gene. Consistent with amylovoran production, an inverse correlation was observed between in vitro expression of amyR and that of amylovoran biosynthetic genes. However, both the amyR knockout mutant and over-expression strains showed reduced levan production, another exopolysaccharide produced by E. amylovora. Virulence assays demonstrated that while the amyR mutant was capable of inducing slightly greater disease severity than that of the WT strain, strains over-expressing the amyR gene did not incite disease on apple shoots or leaves, and only caused reduced disease on immature pear fruits. Microarray studies revealed that amylovoran biosynthesis and related membrane protein-encoding genes were highly expressed in the amyR mutant, but down-regulated in the amyR over-expression strains in vitro. Down-regulation of amylovoran biosynthesis genes in the amyR over-expression strain partially explained why over-expression of amyR led to non-pathogenic or reduced virulence in vivo. These results suggest that AmyR plays an important role in regulating exopolysaccharide production, and thus virulence in E. amylovora.
TI  - Intestinal microbial community diversity between healthy and orally infected rabbit with Entamoeba histolytica by ERIC-PCR.
AB  - Enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC)-PCR was applied to analyze the difference of intestinal microbial community diversity between healthy and orally infected rabbits with Entamoeba histolytica. The dynamic changes in different parts of digestive system including the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, caecum, and rectum in healthy and infected rabbits at different time points were also tested. The intestinal microbial community of the control healthy rabbits was steady, and the total number of ERIC-PCR bands in the control healthy rabbit was the least in the rectum and the most in the caecum. ERIC-PCR bands of orally inoculated rabbits did not obviously change until 24 h after postinoculation (p.i.). The numbers of the ERIC-PCR bands gradually decreased from 24 to 72 h p.i., and then, with the development of disease, the band numbers gradually increased until 6 days p.i. Sequence analysis showed that the nucleotide sequence homologies of the fragment about 1,200 bp of infected ileum sampled at 32 h p.i. were above 95 % with Sinorhizobium meliloti enterobacterial, Erwinia amylovora and Salmonella typhimurium, and the nucleotide sequence homologies of the fragment about 300 bp of infected ileum sampled at 48 h p.i. were more than 90 % with Xanthomonas campestris enterobacterial, Yersinia enterocolitica subsp., Shigella flexneri, S. meliloti enterobacterial, Yersinia pestis, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp., and Escherichia coli. The prominent bacteria had changed after E. histolytica infection. The DNAstar of staple of ERIC-PCR showed that aerobe and facultative aerobe (E. coli, Shigella, and Salmonella) became preponderant bacilli in the intestine of orally infected rabbits with E. histolytica.
TI  - Synthesis, antitumor, and antibacterial activity of bis[4,5-diarylimidazol-2-ylidene]methane derivatives.
AB  - Cationic [bis(1,3-diethyl-4,5-diarylimidazol-2-ylidene)]Au(I) bromide complexes have demonstrated considerable potential as new antitumor agents. In order to investigate whether the gold is crucial for the antitumor activity, the imidazole ligands were connected by a methylene bridge. Biological evaluation revealed that bis[1,3-diethyl-4,5-diarylimidazol-2-ylidene]methane compounds exhibited growth inhibition effects against mammary (MCF-7 and MDA-MB 231) and colon (HT-29) carcinoma cell lines. In comparison with gold complexes, the methylene derivatives showed drastically reduced cell growth inhibitory properties. However, the growth of bacteria was significantly inhibited by bis[1,3-diethyl-4,5-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene]methane dibromide (4) and opens a new application of this compound type.
TI  - Expression of lysozymes from Erwinia amylovora phages and Erwinia genomes and inhibition by a bacterial protein.
AB  - Genes coding for lysozyme-inhibiting proteins (Ivy) were cloned from the chromosomes of the plant pathogens Erwinia amylovora and Erwinia pyrifoliae. The product interfered not only with activity of hen egg white lysozyme, but also with an enzyme from E. amylovora phage PhiEa1h. We have expressed lysozyme genes from the genomes of three Erwinia species in Escherichia coli. The lysozymes expressed from genes of the E. amylovora phages PhiEa104 and PhiEa116, Erwinia chromosomes and Arabidopsis thaliana were not affected by Ivy. The enzyme from bacteriophage PhiEa1h was fused at the N- or C-terminus to other peptides. Compared to the intact lysozyme, a His-tag reduced its lytic activity about 10-fold and larger fusion proteins abolished activity completely. Specific protease cleavage restored lysozyme activity of a GST-fusion. The bacteriophage-encoded lysozymes were more active than the enzymes from bacterial chromosomes. Viral lyz genes were inserted into a broad-host range vector, and transfer to E. amylovora inhibited cell growth. Inserted in the yeast Pichia pastoris, the PhiEa1h-lysozyme was secreted and also inhibited by Ivy. Here we describe expression of unrelated cloned 'silent' lyz genes from Erwinia chromosomes and a novel interference of bacterial Ivy proteins with a viral lysozyme.
TI  - Differential expression of biphenyl synthase gene family members in fire-blight-infected apple 'Holsteiner Cox'.
AB  - Fire blight, caused by the bacterium Erwinia amylovora, is a devastating disease  of apple (Malus x domestica). The phytoalexins of apple are biphenyls and dibenzofurans, whose carbon skeleton is formed by biphenyl synthase (BIS), a type III polyketide synthase. In the recently published genome sequence of apple 'Golden Delicious', nine BIS genes and four BIS gene fragments were detected. The nine genes fall into four subfamilies, referred to as MdBIS1 to MdBIS4. In a phylogenetic tree, the BIS amino acid sequences from apple and Sorbus aucuparia formed an individual cluster within the clade of the functionally diverse type III polyketide synthases. cDNAs encoding MdBIS1 to MdBIS4 were cloned from fire-blight-infected shoots of apple 'Holsteiner Cox,' heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli, and functionally analyzed. Benzoyl-coenzyme A and salicoyl-coenzyme A were the preferred starter substrates. In response to inoculation with E. amylovora, the BIS3 gene was expressed in stems of cv Holsteiner Cox, with highest transcript levels in the transition zone between necrotic and healthy tissues. The transition zone was the accumulation site of biphenyl and dibenzofuran phytoalexins. Leaves contained transcripts for BIS2 but failed to form immunodetectable amounts of BIS protein. In cell cultures of apple 'Cox Orange,' expression of the BIS1 to BIS3 genes was observed after the addition of an autoclaved E. amylovora suspension. Using immunofluorescence localization under a confocal laser-scanning microscope, the BIS3 protein in the transition zone of stems was detected in the parenchyma of the bark. Dot-shaped immunofluorescence was confined to the junctions between neighboring cortical parenchyma cells.
TI  - The orphan gene ybjN conveys pleiotropic effects on multicellular behavior and survival of Escherichia coli.
AB  - YbjN, encoding an enterobacteria-specific protein, is a multicopy suppressor of temperature sensitivity in the ts9 mutant strain of Escherichia coli. In this study, we further explored the role(s) of ybjN. First, we demonstrated that the ybjN transcript was about 10-fold lower in the ts9 strain compared to that of E. coli strain BW25113 (BW). Introduction of multiple copies of ybjN in the ts9 strain resulted in over-expression of ybjN by about 10-fold as compared to that of BW. These results suggested that temperature sensitivity of the ts9 mutant of E. coli may be related to expression levels of ybjN. Characterization of E. coli ybjN mutant revealed that ybjN mutation resulted in pleiotropic phenotypes, including increased motility, fimbriation (auto-aggregation), exopolysaccharide production, and biofilm formation. In contrast, over-expression of ybjN (in terms of multiple copies) resulted in reduced motility, fimbriation, exopolysaccharide production, biofilm formation and acid resistance. In addition, our results indicate that a ybjN-homolog gene from Erwinia amylovora, a plant enterobacterial pathogen, is functionally conserved with that of E. coli, suggesting similar evolution of the YbjN family proteins in enterobacteria. A microarray study revealed that the expression level of ybjN was inversely correlated with the expression of flagellar, fimbrial and acid resistance genes. Over-expression of ybjN significantly down-regulated genes involved in citric acid cycle, glycolysis, the glyoxylate shunt, oxidative phosphorylation, amino acid and nucleotide metabolism. Furthermore, over-expression of ybjN up-regulated toxin-antitoxin modules, the SOS response pathway, cold shock and starvation induced transporter genes. Collectively, these results suggest that YbjN may play important roles in regulating bacterial multicellular behavior, metabolism, and survival under stress conditions in E. coli. These results also suggest that ybjN over-expression-related temperature rescue of the ts9 mutant may be due to down-regulation of metabolic activity and activation of stress response genes in the ts9 mutant.
TI  - A head-to-head comparison of eneamide and epoxyamide inhibitors of glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase from the dapdiamide biosynthetic pathway.
AB  - The dapdiamides make up a family of antibiotics that have been presumed to be cleaved in the target cell to enzyme-inhibitory N-acyl-2,3-diaminopropionate (DAP) warheads containing two alternative electrophilic moieties. Our prior biosynthetic studies revealed that an eneamide warhead is made first and converted to an epoxyamide via a three-enzyme branch pathway. Here we provide a rationale for this logic. We report that the R,R-epoxyamide warhead is a more efficient covalent inactivator of glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase by 1 order of magnitude versus the eneamide, and this difference correlates with a >10-fold difference in antibiotic activity for the corresponding acyl-DAP dipeptides.
TI  - Characterization of the RcsC sensor kinase from Erwinia amylovora and other Enterobacteria.
AB  - RcsC is a hybrid sensor kinase which contains a sensor domain, a histidine kinase domain, and a receiver domain. We have previously demonstrated that, although the Erwinia amylovora rcsC mutant produces more amylovoran than the wild-type (WT) strain in vitro, the mutant remains nonpathogenic on both immature pear fruit and apple plants. In this study, we have comparatively characterized the Erwinia RcsC and its homologs from various enterobacteria. Results demonstrate that expression of the Erwinia rcsC gene suppresses amylovoran production in various amylovoran overproducing WT and mutant strains, thus suggesting the presence of a net phosphatase activity of Erwinia RcsC. Findings have also demonstrated that rcsC homologs from other enterobacteria could not rescue amylovoran production of the Erwinia rcsC mutant in vitro. However, virulence of the Erwinia rcsC mutant is partially restored by rcsC homologs from Pantoea stewartii, Yersinia pestis, and Salmonella enterica but not from Escherichia coli on apple shoots. Domain-swapping experiments have indicated that replacement of the E. coli RcsC sensor domain by those of Erwinia and Yersinia spp. partially restores virulence of the Erwinia rcsC mutant, whereas chimeric constructs containing the sensor domain of E. coli RcsC could not rescue virulence of the Erwinia rcsC mutant on apple. Interestingly, only chimeric constructs containing the histidine kinase and receiver domains of Erwinia RcsC are fully capable of rescuing amylovoran production. These results suggest that the sensor domain of RcsC may be important in regulating bacterial virulence, whereas the activity of the histidine kinase and receiver domains of Erwinia RcsC may be essential for amylovoran production in vitro.
TI  - Regulation of a phage endolysin by disulfide caging.
AB  - In contrast to canonical phage endolysins, which require holin-mediated disruption of the membrane to gain access to attack the cell wall, signal anchor release (SAR) endolysins are secreted by the host sec system, where they accumulate in an inactive form tethered to the membrane by their N-terminal SAR domains. SAR endolysins become activated by various mechanisms upon release from the membrane. In its inactive form, the prototype SAR endolysin, Lyz(P1), of coliphage P1, has an active-site Cys covalently blocked by a disulfide bond; activation involves a disulfide bond isomerization driven by a thiol in the newly released SAR domain, unblocking the active-site Cys. Here, we report that Lyz(103), the endolysin of Erwinia phage ERA103, is also a SAR endolysin. Although Lyz(103) does not have a catalytic Cys, genetic evidence suggests that it also is activated by a thiol-disulfide isomerization triggered by a thiol in the SAR domain. In this case, the inhibitory disulfide in nascent Lyz(103) is formed between cysteine residues flanking a catalytic glutamate, caging the active site. Thus, Lyz(P1) and Lyz(103) define subclasses of SAR endolysins that differ in the nature of their inhibitory disulfide, and Lyz(103) is the first enzyme found to be regulated by disulfide bond caging of its active site.
TI  - Nocapyrones A-D, gamma-pyrones from a Nocardiopsis strain isolated from the marine sponge Halichondria panicea.
AB  - Four new gamma-pyrones, nocapyrones A-D (1-4), were isolated from an organic extract of the Nocardiopsis strain HB383, which was isolated from the marine sponge Halichondria panicea. These are the first gamma-pyrones reported from a Nocardiopsis strain. The structures were elucidated on the basis of one- and two-dimensional NMR experiments and supported by HPLC-UV/MS and HRESIMS analyses. The biosynthesis of nocapyrone A was investigated by feeding experiments with (13)C-labeled compounds. In addition, one diketopiperazine, which was only known as a synthetic compound before, was isolated. The bioactivies of 1, 2, and the diketopiperazine were evaluated in a panel of assays.
TI  - Complete genomic sequence of bacteriophage felix o1.
AB  - Bacteriophage O1 is a Myoviridae A1 group member used historically for identifying Salmonella. Sequencing revealed a single, linear, 86,155-base-pair genome with 39% average G+C content, 131 open reading frames, and 22 tRNAs. Closest protein homologs occur in Erwinia amylovora phage phiEa21-4 and Escherichia coli phage wV8. Proteomic analysis indentified structural proteins: Gp23, Gp36 (major tail protein), Gp49, Gp53, Gp54, Gp55, Gp57, Gp58 (major capsid protein), Gp59, Gp63, Gp64, Gp67, Gp68, Gp69, Gp73, Gp74 and Gp77 (tail fiber). Based on phage-host codon differences, 7 tRNAs could affect translation rate during infection. Introns, holin-lysin cassettes, bacterial toxin homologs and host RNA polymerase-modifying genes were absent.
TI  - Improve bioavailability of Harpin protein on plant use PLGA based nanoparticle.
AB  - Harpins can induce systemic acquired resistance (SAR) pathway on scores of non-host plant, provide protection against a range of pathogens. In this study, we demonstrated that applied recombinant HarpinZ Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (rHrpZ) on tobacco with three kinds of methods: infiltrating from micro-pore into leaf; injecting into petiole, and spraying on leaf, there is great difference in assimilation of protein because of the poor osmosis of tobacco leaves, and with multi-application of rHrpZ, the stimulation effect decreased. We prepared poly d,l-lactide-co-glycolide nanoparticles containing rHrpZ (rHrpZ PLGA NPs). To study the drug effect, we analyzed the change ratio of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) activity and PR-5dB gene expression after administration of rHrpZ and rHrpZ PLGA NPs on tobacco leaves. The results show that rHrpZ could elicit a rapid and transient increase in both PAL activity and PR-5dB expression, but the effect decreased after multi-application. While sprayed rHrpZ PLGA NPs on leaves, both the change ratio of PAL activity and PR-5dB expression were comparatively smooth and durable. Our study suggested that rHrpZ NPs could help protein enter leaf epidermis and cell wall, release rHrpZ in situ continuously, and enhance the bioavailability of rHrpZ.
TI  - Construction and analysis of pathogenicity island deletion mutants of Erwinia amylovora.
AB  - An easy gene-knockout technique, PCR-based one-step inactivation of chromosomal genes, is widely used in Escherichia coli and related enterobacteria to construct mutants. In this study, we adapted this technique to construct genomic island and large operon deletion mutants of Erwinia amylovora, including the 33.4 kb hrp-type III secretion (T3SS) pathogenicity island (PAI1) and the 15.8 kb amylovoran biosynthesis (AMS) operon. Deletion of 2 novel T3SS pathogenicity islands (PAI2 and PAI3) and an operon encoding a type II secretion system (T2SS) demonstrated that these determinants are not involved in virulence in plants. Co-inoculation experiments demonstrated that the hrp-T3SS and AMS deletion mutants could complement each other. These results further confirmed that the one-step inactivation technique can be used to generate large deletions in E. amylovora.
TI  - The genome and proteome of a virulent Escherichia coli O157:H7 bacteriophage closely resembling Salmonella phage Felix O1.
AB  - Based upon whole genome and proteome analysis, Escherichia coli O157:H7-specific  bacteriophage (phage) wV8 belongs to the new myoviral genus, "the Felix O1-like viruses" along with Salmonella phage Felix O1 and Erwinia amylovora phage phiEa21-4. The genome characteristics of phage wV8 (size 88.49 kb, mol%G+C 38.9, 138 ORFs, 23 tRNAs) are very similar to those of phage Felix O1 (86.16 kb, 39.0 mol%G+C, 131 ORFs and 22 tRNAs) and, indeed most of the proteins have their closest homologs within Felix O1. Approximately one-half of the Escherichia coli O157:H7 mutants resistant to phage wV8 still serotype as O157:H7 indicating that this phage may recognize, like coliphage T4, two different surface receptors: lipopolysaccharide and, perhaps, an outer membrane protein.
TI  - Genetic exchange of multidrug efflux pumps among two enterobacterial species with distinctive ecological Niches.
AB  - AcrAB-TolC is the major multidrug efflux system in Enterobacteriaceae recognizing structurally unrelated molecules including antibiotics, dyes, and detergents. Additionally, in Escherichia coli it mediates resistance to bile salts. In the plant pathogen Erwinia amylovora AcrAB-TolC is required for virulence and phytoalexin resistance. Exchange analysis of AcrAB-TolC was conducted by complementing mutants of both species defective in acrB or tolC with alleles from either species. The acrB and tolC mutants exhibited increased susceptibility profiles for 24 different antibiotics. All mutants were complemented with acrAB or tolC, respectively, regardless of the taxonomic origin of the alleles. Importantly, complementation of E. amylovora mutants with respective E. coli genes restored virulence on apple plants. It was concluded that AcrAB and TolC of both species could interact and that these interactions did not yield in altered functions despite the divergent ecological niches, to which E. coli and E. amylovora have adopted.
TI  - WtsE, an AvrE-family type III effector protein of Pantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii, causes cell death in non-host plants.
AB  - Pantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii (Pnss) causes Stewart's bacterial wilt of sweet corn and leaf blight of maize. The pathogenicity of Pnss depends on synthesis of extracellular polysaccharide and an Hrp type III secretion system. WtsE, a type III secreted effector protein, is essential for the virulence of Pnss on corn. It belongs to the AvrE family of effectors, which includes DspA/E from Erwinia amylovora and AvrE1 from Pseudomonas syringae. Previously, WtsE was shown to cause disease-associated cell death in its host plant, sweet corn. Here, we examine the biological activity of WtsE in several non-host plants. WtsE induced cell death in Nicotiana benthamiana, tobacco, beet and Arabidopsis thaliana when it was transiently produced in plant cells following agroinfiltration or translocated into plant cells from Pnss, Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola (Pph). WtsE-induced cell death in N. benthamiana, tobacco and beet resembled a hypersensitive response and in N. benthamiana it was delayed by cycloheximide. Interestingly, WtsE strongly promoted the growth of Pnss in N. benthamiana prior to the onset of cell death. Deletion derivatives of WtsE that failed to induce cell death in N. benthamiana and tobacco also did not complement wtsE mutants of Pnss for virulence in sweet corn, indicating a correlation between the two activities. WtsE also induced cell death in A. thaliana, where it suppressed basal defences induced by Pph. Thus, WtsE has growth-promoting, defence-suppressing and cell death-inducing activities in non-host plants. Expression of WtsE also prevented the growth of yeast, possibly due to an innate toxicity to eukaryotic cells.
TI  - Colonization of Host Plants by the Fire Blight Pathogen Erwinia amylovora Marked  with Genes for Bioluminescence and Fluorescence.
AB  - ABSTRACT To follow the movement of Erwinia amylovora in plant tissue without dissection, this bacterium was marked with either the lux operon from Vibrio fischeri or the gfp gene from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria, both carried on multicopy plasmids and expressed under the control of the lac promoter from Escherichia coli. Movement of the pathogen was visualized in leaves, stems, and roots of apple seedlings, and migration of E. amylovora was traced from inoculation sites in the stem to as far as the roots. Green fluorescent E. amylovora cells were observed in the xylem and later appeared to break out of the vessels into the intercellular spaces of the adjacent parenchyma. Inoculation in the intercostal region of leaves caused a zone of slow necrosis that finally resulted in bacterial invasion of the xylem vessels. Labeled bacteria could also be seen in association with the anchor sites of leaf hairs. Distortion of the epidermis adjacent to leaf hairs created openings that were observed by scanning electron microscopy. As the intercostal region, the bases of leaf hairs provided E. amylovora access to intact xylem vessels, which allowed further distribution of the pathogen in the host plant.
TI  - Dual Activity of a Viral Lysozyme with High Efficiency for Growth Inhibition of Erwinia amylovora.
AB  - ABSTRACT The lysozyme from Erwinia amylovora phage PhiEa1h was investigated for its ability to inhibit growth of bacteria and compared with the lysozyme from Escherichia coli phage T4. The assays to measure lysozyme activity included cell lysis and growth inhibition of bacteria. Bacterial strains with kanamycin resistance were not affected by lysates containing the PhiEa1h-enzyme. The titer of Micrococcus luteus but not of Erwinia amylovora was diminished by cell extracts containing T4 lysozyme. In contrast, PhiEa1h lysozyme preferentially inhibited E. amylovora, exceeding the T4 lysozyme activity at least one million-fold. Spherical cells were formed after application to E. amylovora similar to lyz-gene expression in Escherichia coli. Heating of cell extracts destroyed the murami-dase activity, but retained an antibacterial activity. Other plant-associated bacteria related to Erwinia amylovora also were inhibited for growth when cell extracts with PhiEa1h lysozyme were applied to soak pear slices and potato slices. Ooze formation and soft rot caused by E. amylovora or E. carotovora subsp. atroseptica, respectively, were strongly reduced and the PhiEa1h lysozyme was more efficient compared with extracts containing T4 lysozyme.
TI  - [Study of hrpN(CSDS001) and the gene expression profile of Arabidopsis thaliana induced by Harpin(CSDS001)].
AB  - Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora CSDS001 elicits hypersensitive reaction (HR) in tobacco. From the genomic libraries of Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora CSDS001, the hrpNCSDS001 gene (GenBank number AY939927), was isolated. The hrpNCSDS001 fusion protein was produced in Escherichia coli, and was used to induce HR by injecting into tobacco. We further examined the global regulation of Arabidopsis thaliana genes in response to HarpinCSDS001 at a concentration of 30 miccrog/mL. We indicated that 912, 1787, 2393, 1833 and 1,755 genes that were regulated significantly (log ratio <or=-1 or >or=1) at 3 h, 12 h, 24 h, 36 h and 48 h respectively after the treatment. Analysis of some transcription factors (TF) showed that 13 TF families responded to HarpinCSDS001 including ZIM, BES1, TCP, C2C2, AP2/EREBP, WRKY, bHLH, bZIP, GARP, MYB, NAC, HB, C2H2. These families mainly function in biological processes of plant defense, pho-tosynthesisdevelopment and flowering.
TI  - Cloning and expression of streptomycin inactivating enzymes APH(6)-Ia and APH(6)-Id.
AB  - Discovered in the 1940s by Selman Waksman, the aminoglycoside antibiotic streptomycin is clinically important in the treatment of tuberculosis worldwide. However, strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and other pathogenic bacteria have become resistant to streptomycin. One mechanism by which this can occur is through the action of phosphotransferases that attach a phosphate group to position 6 of the streptidine ring of streptomycin, thereby inactivating it. Two such phosphotransferases are APH(6)-Ia from producer strain Streptomyces griseus, and APH(6)-Id found in animal, plant and human pathogenic isolates. Here, we report the subcloning and expression in Escherichia coli of soluble recombinant APH(6)-Ia and Id enzymes. Sequencing of aph(6)-Ia revealed a one-nucleotide disagreement with the published sequence, such that the amino acid at position 262 is an alanine instead of a serine. The sequence of aph(6)-Id is identical to that of the gene found in transposon Tn5393 of plant pathogen Erwinia amylovora. The successful expression of soluble forms of these enzymes now paves the way for experiments to study their structure and function by using site-directed mutagenesis.
TI  - Porin isolated from the outer membrane of Erwinia amylovora and its encoding gene.
AB  - A major Erwinia amylovora outer-membrane protein (Omp-EA) and the gene encoding for this protein (omp-EA) were isolated and characterized. The native Omp-EA protein forms a trimeric structure of approximately 114 kDa. This protein demonstrated high resistance to detergents such as SDS and octyl-glucopyranoside, but disaggregated to monomers with a molecular weight (MW) of approximately 39 kDa after heating at 95 degrees C for 10 minutes in sample buffer. The pore-forming ability of the oligomeric Omp-EA was determined by the liposome swelling assay, demonstrating that the oligomeric protein formed nonspecific channels with an exclusion limit of approximately 660 Da. On dissociation, the monomers did not exhibit pore-forming ability. The omp-EA gene was cloned and sequenced (GenBank Accession No. DQ184680). Sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of 1152 bases. The deduced amino-acid sequence had 383 amino acids. The mature protein consisted of 362 amino acids and had a calculated MW of 39,210 Da. Multiple-sequence alignment of Omp-EA with other porins from the Enterobacteriaceae family revealed 51% to 63% identity. The first 16 amino acids from the N-terminal exhibited the highest identity (100%) to the porins OmpC, OmpF, and PhoE of Escherichia coli. Two methods were used to predict the secondary structure: APSSP2 and Hidden and Markov's model. The monomers of Omp-EA porin presented a topology of 16 transmembranal beta-strands. The area of the loops between the beta -strands was proposed. It is suggested that further research on the porin and its loops may be important for understanding the mechanism of E. amylovor to invade plant tissues.
TI  - Identification of a key functional region in harpins from Xanthomonas that suppresses protein aggregation and mediates harpin expression in E. coli.
AB  - In the current study, we identified a key functional region in harpins from Xanthomonas that suppressed protein aggregation and mediated its expression in E. coli. Our data suggested that the presence of two common features in harpins [Wei et al. (1992) Science 257:85-88], namely, high glycine content and lack of cysteine residues, were not sufficient for Xanthomonas to elicit hypersensitive response (HR) activity or heat stability. Additionally, bioinformatic analyses revealed that the secondary structure of a conserved N-terminal region consisting of 12 highly hydrophilic amino acids (QGISEKQLDQLL) was alpha-helical. Following site-directed mutagenesis deletion of this region, the three mutated harpin proteins, in cultures induced at 37 degrees C, failed to elicit a HR in tobacco leaves. However, at 24 degrees C, two mutated harpins retained the ability to elicit HR, albeit with lower expression levels than that noted with the wild-type. SDS-PAGE and Western blot data suggested the HpaG mutant protein was found almost entirely in the inclusion body. These data demonstrated that these conserved amino acid residues played a critical role in protein aggregation and inclusion body formation in harpins from Xanthomonas.
TI  - Tobacco nectaries express a novel NADPH oxidase implicated in the defense of floral reproductive tissues against microorganisms.
AB  - Hydrogen peroxide produced from the nectar redox cycle was shown to be a major factor contributing to inhibition of most microbial growth in floral nectar; however, this obstacle can be overcome by the floral pathogen Erwinia amylovora. To identify the source of superoxide that leads to hydrogen peroxide accumulation in nectary tissues, nectaries were stained with nitroblue tetrazolium. Superoxide production was localized near nectary pores and inhibited by diphenylene iodonium but not by cyanide or azide, suggesting that NAD(P)H oxidase is the source of superoxide. Native PAGE assays demonstrated that NADPH (not NADH) was capable of driving the production of superoxide, diphenyleneiodonium chloride was an efficient inhibitor of this activity, but cyanide and azide did not inhibit. These results confirm that the production of superoxide was due to an NADPH oxidase. The nectary enzyme complex was distinct by migration on gels from the leaf enzyme complex. Temporal expression patterns demonstrated that the superoxide production (NADPH oxidase activity) was coordinated with nectar secretion, the expression of Nectarin I (a superoxide dismutase in nectar), and the expression of NOX1, a putative gene for a nectary NADPH oxidase that was cloned from nectaries and identified as an rbohD-like NADPH oxidase. Further, in situ hybridization studies indicated that the NADPH oxidase was expressed in the early stages of flower development although superoxide was generated at later stages (after Stage 10), implicating posttranslational regulation of the NADPH oxidase in the nectary.
TI  - Autoinducer-2 of the fire blight pathogen Erwinia amylovora and other plant-associated bacteria.
AB  - Autoinducers are important for cellular communication of bacteria. The luxS gene  has a central role in the synthesis of autoinducer-2 (AI-2). The gene was identified in a shotgun library of Erwinia amylovora and primers designed for PCR amplification from bacterial DNA. Supernatants of several Erwinia amylovora strains were assayed for AI-2 activity with a Vibrio harveyi mutant and were positive. Many other plant-associated bacteria also showed AI-2 activity such as Erwinia pyrifoliae and Erwinia tasmaniensis. The luxS genes of several bacteria were cloned, sequenced, and complemented Escherichia coli strain DH5alpha and a Salmonella typhimurium mutant, both defective in luxS, for synthesis of AI-2. Assays to detect AI-2 activity in culture supernatants of several Pseudomonas syringae pathovars failed, which may indicate the absence of AI-2 or synthesis of another type. Several reporter strains did not detect synthesis of an acyl homoserine lactone (AHL, AI-1) by Erwinia amylovora, but confirmed AHL-synthesis for Erwinia carotovora ssp. atroseptica and Pantoea stewartii.
TI  - WtsE, an AvrE-family effector protein from Pantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii, causes disease-associated cell death in corn and requires a chaperone protein for stability.
AB  - The pathogenicity of Pantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii to sweet corn and maize requires a Hrp type III secretion system. In this study, we genetically and functionally characterized a disease-specific (Dsp) effector locus, composed of wtsE and wtsF, that is adjacent to the hrp gene cluster. WtsE, a member of the AvrE family of effector proteins, was essential for pathogenesis on corn and was complemented by DspA/E from Erwinia amylovora. An intact C-terminus of WtsE, which contained a putative endoplasmic reticulum membrane retention signal, was important for function of WtsE. Delivery of WtsE into sweet corn leaves by an Escherichia coli strain carrying the hrp cluster of Erwinia chrysanthemi caused water-soaking and necrosis. WtsE-induced cell death was not inhibited by cycloheximide treatment, unlike the hypersensitive response caused by a known Avr protein, AvrRxol. WtsF, the putative chaperone of WtsE, was not required for secretion of WtsE from P. stewartii, and the virulence of wtsF mutants was reduced only at low inoculum concentrations. However, WtsF was required for full accumulation of WtsE within the bacteria at low temperatures. In contrast, WtsF was needed for efficient delivery of WtsE from E. coli via the Erwinia chrysanthemi Hrp system.
TI  - Biological activities of purified harpin(Xoo) and harpin(Xoo) detection in transgenic plants using its polyclonal antibody.
AB  - Many harpins have been found in plant pathogen bacteria that can elicit disease and insect resistance in plants, and promote plant growth. In this work, we overexpressed and purified Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae harpin, harpin(Xoo), in Escherichia coli BL21/pGEX-hpa1. Harpin(Xoo) was fused to the C-terminus of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and purified using the Bulk GST purification module and thrombin cleavage capture kit. Purified harpin(Xoo) protein was sensitive to protease K and stable to heat treatment, and could not induce a hypersensitive response after treatment with various plant metabolic inhibitors; these characteristics were similar to harpin(Ea) of Erwinia amylovora. The purified harpin(Xoo) showed a similar ability to induce tobacco mosaic virus resistance in tobacco as harpin(Ea). Its antibody worked well in detecting the purified harpin(Xoo), harpin(Xoo) in the total protein of E. coli BL21/pGEX-hpa1 and an hpa1 transgenic rice.
TI  - Bacterial species specificity in proU osmoinducibility and nptII and lacZ expression.
AB  - Reporter gene-based transcriptional fusions are increasingly being used to address questions in microbial ecology, with constitutively expressed fusions enabling microbe tracking and inducible fusions reporting the presence of environmental signals. To more readily apply this technology to a variety of bacterial species, we examined species specificity in the expression of three promoters of interest. A comparison of two potentially constitutive promoters, each fused to the reporter gene gfp, showed that the nptII promoter (P(nptII)) was expressed in a broader range of species (100% of 11 tested) than the lacZ promoter (P(lacZ)) (75% of 11 tested), and thus has broader applicability for marking bacteria than P(lacZ). For the species that expressed P(lacZ), however,P(lacZ) was expressed 3-fold more than P(nptII), on average. The Escherichia coli proU promoter, which is induced by low water potential in E. coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Pantoea agglomerans, and Pseudomonas syringae, was shown to be similarly responsive to water potential in strains of Clavibacter michiganensis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, and Sinorhizobium meliloti, as well as mildly osmoresponsive in Agrobacterium tumefaciens, supporting its broad use as a reporter of water potential. Surprisingly, this promoter was not regulated by water potential in strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Erwinia amylovora, illustrating heretofore unrecognized species specificity in proU inducibility, as well as potential limitations in the species that can serve as bioreporters of water potential.
TI  - Genetic diversity of harpins from Xanthomonas oryzae and their activity to induce hypersensitive response and disease resistance in tobacco.
AB  - Three hrfA (hypersensitive response-functioning faction A) homologues (hrfl, hrf2 and hrf3) are cloned from 12 strains of Xanthomonas oryzae using PCR based techniques. Hrf1, hrf2 and hrf3 are derived from strains belonging to X. o. pv. oryzae, X. o. pv. oryzicola and X. o. pv. oryzae respectively. Sequence analysis shows that all three genes encode glycine-rich proteins with various numbers of GGG-GG motifs. They all share a conserved cysteine residue at position 45 or 47. Hrf1 and hrf3 encode Harpin(xoo) while hrf2 encodes Harpin(xooc) Hrf1 and hrf3 encodes two different types of Harpin(xoo) proteins. Hrf1 from X. o. pv. oryzae strains (JxoIII, JxoIV, Jxov, Pxo61, Pxo76, Pxo79, Pxo99, Pxo99 and Pxo124) encodes a 15.6 kD Harpin(xoo) with 3 GGG-GG motifs while Hrf3 from strain Pxo86 and Pxo112 encodes a 15.9 kD Harpin(xoo) with 4 GGG-GG motifs. Harpin(xooc) encoded by hrf2 from X. o. pv. oryzicola (strain RS105) has the molecular weight of 15.3 kD and contains 2 GGG-GG motifs. Cluster analysis is performed using deduced sequences of hrf1, hrf2 and hrf3 as well as previously reported Hpa1 and Xopl protein sequence. The results indicated that Harpin(xoo) and Harpin(xooc) belong to two closely related subgroups. Hrf, hrf2 and hrf3 are expressed in E. coli strain BL21 successfully. Under the same condition, hrf1, hrf2 and hrf3 are expressed at the level of 0.389, 0.530 and 0.083 mg/mL respectively. All expressed hrf1, hrf2 and hrf3 proteins (Harpins) are shown to be able to induce hypersensitive reaction and TMV resistance on tobacco. Among the three proteins, Hrf2 has the highest activity while Hrf3 has the lowest activity.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing and partial characterisation of sorbitol transporter (srlT) gene encoding phosphotransferase system, glucitol/sorbitol-specific IIBC components of Erwinia herbicola ATCC 21998.
AB  - A DNA fragment of approximately 1500 bp, harbouring the sorbitol transport gene (srlT), was amplified from the chromosomal DNA of Erwinia herbicola ATCC 21998 by PCR and cloned in Escherichia coli JM109. Degenerate oligonucleotide primers used were designed based on the conserved regions in the gene sequences within the gut operon of E. coli (Gene Bank accession no. J02708) and the srl operon of Erwinia amylovora (Gene Bank accession no. Y14603). The cloned DNA fragment was sequenced and found to contain an open reading frame of 1473 nucleotides coding for a protein of 491 amino acids, corresponding to a mass of 52410 Da. The nucleotide sequence of this ORF was highly homologous to that of the gutA gene of Escherichia coli gut operon, the srlE gene of Shigella flexrni and the sorbitol transporter gene sequence of Escherichia coli K12 (Gene Bank accession nos. J02708, AE016987 and D90892 respectively). The protein sequence showed significant homology to that of the phosphotransferase system i.e. the glucitol/sorbitol-specific IIBC components of Escherichia coli and Erwinia amylovora (P56580, O32522). The cloned DNA fragment was introduced into a pRA90 vector and the recombinant was used for developing srlT mutants of Erwinia herbicola, by homologous recombination. Mutants obtained were unable to grow on minimal medium with sorbitol. The insertion of the pRA90 vector inside the srlT gene sequence of the mutants was confirmed by DNA-DNA hybridisation.
TI  - Expression of bacteriophage phiEa1h lysozyme in Escherichia coli and its activity in growth inhibition of Erwinia amylovora.
AB  - A 3.3 kb fragment from Erwinia amylovora phage Ea1h in plasmid pJH94 was previously characterized and found to contain an exopolysaccharide depolymerase (dpo) gene and two additional ORFs encoding 178 and 119 amino acids. ORF178 (lyz) and ORF119 (hol) were found to overlap by 19 bp and they resembled genes encoding lysozymes and holins. In nucleotide sequence alignments, lyz had structurally conserved regions with residues important for lysozyme function. The lyz gene was cloned into an expression vector and expressed in Escherichia coli. Active lysozyme was detected only when E. coli cells with the lyz gene and a kanamycin-resistance cassette were grown in the presence of kanamycin. Growth of Erw. amylovora was inhibited after addition of enzyme exceeding a threshold for lysozyme to target cells. When immature pears were soaked in lysates of induced cells, symptoms such as ooze formation and necrosis were retarded or inhibited after inoculation with Erw. amylovora.
TI  - The phytoalexin-inducible multidrug efflux pump AcrAB contributes to virulence in the fire blight pathogen, Erwinia amylovora.
AB  - The enterobacterium Erwinia amylovora causes fire blight on members of the family Rosaceae, with economic importance on apple and pear. During pathogenesis, the bacterium is exposed to a variety of plant-borne antimicrobial compounds. In plants of Rosaceae, many constitutively synthesized isoflavonoids affecting microorganisms were identified. Bacterial multidrug efflux transporters which mediate resistance toward structurally unrelated compounds might confer tolerance to these phytoalexins. To prove this hypothesis, we cloned the acrAB locus from E. amylovora encoding a resistance nodulation division-type transport system. In Escherichia coli, AcrAB of E. amylovora conferred resistance to hydrophobic and amphiphilic toxins. An acrB-deficient E. amylovora mutant was impaired in virulence on apple rootstock MM 106. Furthermore, it was susceptible toward extracts of leaves of MM 106 as well as to the apple phytoalexins phloretin, naringenin, quercetin, and (+)-catechin. The expression of acrAB was determined using the promoterless reporter gene egfp. The acrAB operon was up-regulated in vitro by the addition of phloretin and naringenin. The promoter activity of acrR, encoding a regulatory protein involved in acrAB expression, was increased by naringenin. In planta, an induction of acrAB was proved by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Our results strongly suggest that the AcrAB transport system plays an important role as a protein complex required for virulence of E. amylovora in resistance toward apple phytoalexins and that it is required for successful colonization of a host plant.
TI  - Structural analysis of the DNA-binding domain of the Erwinia amylovora RcsB protein and its interaction with the RcsAB box.
AB  - The transcriptional regulator RcsB interacts with other coactivators to control the expression of biosynthetic operons in enterobacteria. While in a heterodimer complex with the regulator RcsA the RcsAB box consensus is recognized, DNA binding sites for RcsB without RcsA have also been identified. The conformation of RcsB might therefore be modulated upon interaction with various coactivators, resulting in the recognition of different DNA targets. We report the solution structure of the C-terminal DNA-binding domain of the RcsB protein from Erwinia amylovora spanning amino acid residues 129-215 solved by heteronuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The C-terminal domain is composed of four alpha-helices where two central helices form a helix-turn-helix motif similar to the structures of the regulatory proteins GerE, NarL, and TraR. Amino acid residues involved in the RcsA independent DNA binding of RcsB were identified by titration studies with a RcsAB box consensus fragment. Data obtained from NMR spectroscopy together with surface plasmon resonance measurements demonstrate that the RcsAB box is specifically recognized by the RcsAB heterodimer as well as by RcsB alone. However, the binding constant of RcsB alone at target promoters from Escherichia coli, E. amylovora, and Pantoea stewartii was approximately 1 order of magnitude higher compared with that of the RcsAB heterodimer. We present evidence that the obvious role of RcsA is not to alter the DNA binding specificity of RcsB but to stabilize RcsB-DNA complexes.
TI  - The HrpX/HrpY two-component system activates hrpS expression, the first step in the regulatory cascade controlling the Hrp regulon in Pantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii.
AB  - A regulatory cascade activating hrp/hrc type III secretion and effector genes was delineated in Pantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii, a bacterial pathogen of corn. Four hrp regulatory genes were characterized: hrpX and hrpY encode the sensor kinase and response regulator, respectively, of a two-component signal transduction system; hrpS encodes an NtrC-like transcriptional enhancer; and hrpL encodes an alternative sigma factor. Epistasis analysis, expression studies using gene fusions, and genetic reconstruction of each step in Escherichia coli were used to delineate the following pathway: HrpY activates hrpS and also positively autoregulates the hrpXY operon. In turn, HrpS is required for full activation of the sigma54-dependent hrpL promoter. Finally, HrpL controls expression of all known hrp and wts genes. In vitro, hrpS and all downstream hrp genes were regulated by pH and salt concentration. Mutants with in-frame deletions in hrpX were still partially virulent on corn but were unable to sense the chemical or metabolic signals that induce hrp genes in vitro. Site-directed mutagenesis of HrpY indicated that aspartate 57 is the probable phosphorylation site and that it is needed for activity. These findings suggest that both HrpX and an alternate mechanism are involved in the activation of HrpY in planta.
TI  - Detection of type III secretion genes as a general indicator of bacterial virulence.
AB  - Type III secretion systems of Gram-negative bacteria are specific export machineries for virulence factors which allow their translocation to eukaryotic cells. Since they correlate with bacterial pathogenicity, their presence is used as a general indicator of bacterial virulence. By comparing the genetic relationship of the major type III secretion systems we found the family of genes encoding the inner-membrane channel proteins represented by the Yersinia enterocolitica lcrD (synonym yscV) and its homologous genes from other species an ideal component for establishing a general detection approach for type III secretion systems. Based on the genes of the lcrD family we developed gene probes for Gram-negative human, animal and plant pathogens. The probes comprise lcrD from Y. enterocolitica, sepA from enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, invA from Salmonella typhimurium, mxiA from Shigella sonnei, as well as hrcV from Erwinia amylovora. In addition we included as a control probe the flhA gene from E. coli K-12 to validate our approach. FlhA is part of the flagellar export apparatus which shows a high degree of similarity with type III secretions systems, but is not involved in pathogenicity. The probes were evaluated by screening a series of pathogenic as well as non-pathogenic bacteria. The probes detected type III secretion in pathogens where such systems were either known or were expected to be present, whereas no positive hybridization signals could be found in non-pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria. Gram-positive bacteria were devoid of known type III secretion systems. No interference due to the genetic similarity between the type III secretion system and the flagellar export apparatus was observed. However, potential type III secretion systems could be detected in bacteria where no such systems have been described yet. The presented approach provides therefore a useful tool for the assessment of the virulence potential of bacterial isolates of human, animal and plant origin. Moreover, it is a powerful means for a first safety assessment of poorly characterized strains intended to be used in biotechnological applications.
TI  - [Type III secretion system in Se9R can recognize and secret harpin in Erwinia amylovora].
AB  - Bacterial pathogens of both animals and plants use type III secretion machines to secret virulence proteins. The signal that leads to tye type III secretion is encoded as stem loop structure in the messenger RNA. Harpin, produced by Erwinia anylovora is secreted via type III secretion. Erwinia carotovora Se9R and Erwinia amylovora belong to the same genus and they use type III secretion machines to secret virulence proteins. We used PCR to amplify hrpN from pCPP430 which harbors hrpN gene cluster, and cloned it to pGEM-T vector to get pWGF1, which was then chemically transformed into DH5 alpha (pCPP430hrpN-) and electrotransformed into Se9R. DH5 alpha (pCPP430hrpN-/pWGF1) induced hypersensitive response on tomato leaf and Se9R(pWGF1) showed significantly reduced virulence than Se9R on Chinese cabbage leaf. Western-blotting analysis of the CFEP of Se9R(pWGF1) showed production of harpin protein. These results suggest the type III secretion machine in Se9R can recognize secretion singal in the gene of harpin in Erwinia amylovora and secret it as a biologically native form.
TI  - [Use transposon and parDE through in vivo cloning to promote the genetic stability of plasmid pCPP430].
AB  - Plasmid pCPP430 carrying the hrp gene cluster after transformated into 308R (Pantoea agglomerans) can cause the hypersensitive response, and simultaneously induce the plant resistance to disease. It was genetically unstable in P. agglomerans. 0.8 kb parDE region of the broad-host range plasmid RK2 is responsible for plasmid partition. It can mediate plasmid maitenance of many kinds in Rhizobium meliloti, and also can promote the genetic stability of recombinant plasmid in the biocontrol bacteria P. agglomerans. In this paper, we cloned parDE into pCPP430 in vivo through transposition to promote its genetic stability. parDE was amplified by PCR, inserted into pGEM-T vector and cut out and religated to NotI-cut transposon vector pUT/mini-Tn5 Km to get a parDE containing mini-Tn5, pTnp. After conjugation between S17-1/lambda pir (pTnp) and 308R (pCPP430), parDE was cloned in vivo into plasmid pCPP430 to obtain pRTnp. It was demonstrated that the insertion of parDE in pCPP430 increased significantly the plasmid's stability in P. agglomerans.
TI  - Soft rot erwiniae: from genes to genomes.
AB  - SUMMARY The soft rot erwiniae, Erwinia carotovora ssp. atroseptica (Eca), E. carotovora ssp. carotovora (Ecc) and E. chrysanthemi (Ech) are major bacterial pathogens of potato and other crops world-wide. We currently understand much about how these bacteria attack plants and protect themselves against plant defences. However, the processes underlying the establishment of infection, differences in host range and their ability to survive when not causing disease, largely remain a mystery. This review will focus on our current knowledge of pathogenesis in these organisms and discuss how modern genomic approaches, including complete genome sequencing of Eca and Ech, may open the door to a new understanding of the potential subtlety and complexity of soft rot erwiniae and their interactions with plants. TAXONOMY: The soft rot erwiniae are members of the Enterobacteriaceae, along with other plant pathogens such as Erwinia amylovora and human pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp. and Yersinia spp. Although the genus name Erwinia is most often used to describe the group, an alternative genus name Pectobacterium was recently proposed for the soft rot species. HOST RANGE: Ech mainly affects crops and other plants in tropical and subtropical regions and has a wide host range that includes potato and the important model host African violet (Saintpaulia ionantha). Ecc affects crops and other plants in subtropical and temperate regions and has probably the widest host range, which also includes potato. Eca, on the other hand, has a host range limited almost exclusively to potato in temperate regions only. Disease symptoms: Soft rot erwiniae cause general tissue maceration, termed soft rot disease, through the production of plant cell wall degrading enzymes. Environmental factors such as temperature, low oxygen concentration and free water play an essential role in disease development. On potato, and possibly other plants, disease symptoms may differ, e.g. blackleg disease is associated more with Eca and Ech than with Ecc.

TI  - Sample sequencing of a selected region of the genome of Erwinia carotovora subsp. atroseptica reveals candidate phytopathogenicity genes and allows comparison with Escherichia coli.
AB  - Genome sequencing is making a profound impact on microbiology. Currently, however, only one plant pathogen genome sequence is publicly available and no genome-sequencing project has been initiated for any species of the genus Erwinia, which includes several important plant pathogens. This paper describes a targeted sample sequencing approach to study the genome of Erwinia carotovora subsp. atroseptica (Eca), a major soft-rot pathogen of potato. A large insert DNA (approx. 115 kb) library of Eca was constructed using a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) vector. Hybridization and end-sequence data revealed two overlapping BAC clones that span an entire hrp gene cluster. Random subcloning and one-fold sequence coverage (>200 kb) across these BACs identified 25 (89%) of 28 hrp genes predicted from the orthologous hrp cluster of Erwinia amylovora. Regions flanking the hrp cluster contained orthologues of known or putative pathogenicity operons from other Erwinia species, including dspEF (E. amylovora), hecAB and pecSM (E. chrysanthemi), sequences similar to genes from the plant pathogen Xylella fastidiosa, including haemagglutinin-like genes, and sequences similar to genes involved in rhizobacterium-plant interactions. Approximately 10% of the sequences showed strongest nucleotide similarities to genes in the closely related model bacterium and animal pathogen Escherichia coli. However, the positions of some of these genes were different in the two genomes. Approximately 30% of sequences showed no significant similarity to any database entries. A physical map was made across the genomic region spanning the hrp cluster by hybridization to the BAC library and to digested BAC clones, and by PCR between sequence contigs. A multiple genome coverage BAC library and one-fold sample sequencing are an effective combination for extracting useful information from important regions of the Eca genome, providing a wealth of candidate novel pathogenicity genes for functional analyses. Other genomic regions could be similarly targeted.
TI  - Biological activity of harpin produced by Pantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii.
AB  - Pantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii causes Stewart's wilt of sweet corn. A hypersensitive response and pathogenicity (Hrp) secretion system is needed to produce water-soaking and wilting symptoms in corn and to cause a hypersensitive response (HR) in tobacco. Sequencing of the hrp cluster revealed a putative harpin gene, hrpN. The product of this gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and shown to elicit the HR in tobacco and systemic resistance in radishes. The protein was designated HrpN(Pnss). Like other harpins, it was heat stable and protease sensitive, although it was three- to fourfold less active biologically than Erwinia amylovora harpin. We used antibodies to purified HrpN(Pnss) to verify that hrpN mutants could not produce harpin. This protein was secreted into the culture supernatant and was produced by strains of P. stewartii subsp. indologenes. In order to determine the importance of HrpN(Pnss) in pathogenesis on sweet corn, three hrpN::Tn5 mutants were compared with the wild-type strain with 50% effective dose, disease severity, response time, and growth rate in planta as parameters. In all tests, HrpN(Pnss) was not required for infection, growth, or virulence in corn or endophytic growth in related grasses.
TI  - Resistance to trimethoprim and sulfonamides.
AB  - Sulfonamides and trimethoprim have been used for many decades as efficient and inexpensive antibacterial agents for animals and man. Resistance to both has, however, spread extensively and rapidly. This is mainly due to the horizontal spread of resistance genes, expressing drug-insensitive variants of the target enzymes dihydropteroate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase, for sulfonamide and trimethoprim, respectively. Two genes, sul1 and sul2, mediated by transposons and plasmids, and expressing dihydropteroate synthases highly resistant to sulfonamide, have been found. For trimethoprim, almost twenty phylogenetically different resistance genes, expressing druginsensitive dihydrofolate reductases have been characterized. They are efficiently spread as cassettes in integrons, and on transposons and plasmids. One particular gene, dfr9, seems to have originally been selected in the intestine of swine, where it was found in Escherichia coli, on large plasmids in a disabled transposon, Tn5393, originally found in the plant pathogen Erwinia amylovora. There are also many examples of chromosomal resistance to sulfonamides and trimethoprim, with different degrees of complexity, from simple base changes in the target genes to transformational and recombinational exchanges of whole genes or parts of genes, forming mosaic gene patterns. Furthermore, the trade-off, seen in laboratory experiments selecting resistance mutants, showing drug-resistant but also less efficient (increased Kms) target enzymes, seems to be adjusted for by compensatory mutations in clinically isolated drug-resistant pathogens. This means that susceptibility will not return after suspending the use of sulfonamide and trimethoprim.
TI  - Visualization of secreted Hrp and Avr proteins along the Hrp pilus during type III secretion in Erwinia amylovora and Pseudomonas syringae.
AB  - Pili are required for protein and/or DNA transfer from bacteria to recipient plant or bacterial cells, based on genetic evidence. However, it has never been shown directly that the effector proteins or DNA are localized along or inside the pili in situ. Failure to visualize an association of effector proteins/DNA with pili is the central issue in the debate regarding the exact function of pili in protein and DNA transfer. In this study, a newly developed in situ immunogold labelling procedure enabled visualization of the specific localization of type III effector proteins of Erwinia amylovora and Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato along the Hrp pilus, but not along the flagellum or randomly in the intercellular space. In contrast, PelE, a pectate lyase secreted via the type II protein secretion system, was not associated with the Hrp pilus. These results provide direct evidence that type III secretion occurs only at the site of Hrp pilus assembly and that the Hrp pilus guides the transfer of effector proteins outside the bacterial cell, favouring the 'conduit/guiding filament' model.
TI  - Identification and expression of the Pseudomonas syringae pv. aptata hrpZ(Psa) gene which encodes an harpin elicitor.
AB  - A sequence homologous to an internal fragment 0.75 kb BstXI of the Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae hrpZ gene was identified in Pseudomonas syringae pv. aptata NCPPB 2664, the causal agent of bacterial blight in sugar beet, lettuce and other plants. and in E. coli DH10B (pCCP1069) containing the P. syringae pv. aptata hrp gene cluster. PCR with oligonucleotides, based on the hrpZ(Pss) gene and used as primers with the total genomic DNA of P. syringae pv. aptata, amplified a 1 kb fragment that hybridized with the probe in highly stringent conditions. The amplicon was cloned into the pGEM-T plasmid vector, amplified in E. coli DH5alpha and sequenced. The sequence showed 95%, 83% and 61% identity with those of hrpZ(Pss), hrpZ(Psg and hrpZ(Pst) genes encoding the harpins of the P. syringae pv. syringae, glycinea and tomato, respectively. The amplicon was cloned into the pMAL expression system. The expressed protein, fused with maltose-binding protein, was cleaved with a specific protease factor Xa, and purified using affinity chromatography. On the basis of the amino acid sequence and its ability to induce HR in tobacco leaves, it was identified as a P. syringae pv. aptata harpin.
TI  - Effects of the two-component system comprising GacA and GacS of Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora on the production of global regulatory rsmB RNA, extracellular enzymes, and harpinEcc.
AB  - Posttranscriptional regulation mediated by the regulator of secondary metabolites (RSM) RsmA-rsmB pair is the most important factor in the expression of genes for extracellular enzymes and HarpinEcc in Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora. RsmA is a small RNA-binding protein, which acts by lowering the half-life of a mRNA species. rsmB specifies an untranslated regulatory RNA and neutralizes the RsmA effect. It has been speculated that GacA-GacS, members of a two-component system, may affect gene expression via RsmA. Because expA, a gacA homolog, and expS (or rpfA), a gacS homolog, have been identified in E. carotovora subsp. carotovora, we examined the effects of these gacA and gacS homologs on the expression of rsmA, rsmB, and an assortment of exoprotein genes. The gacA gene of E. carotovora subsp. carotovora strain 71 stimulated transcription of genes for several extracellular enzymes (pel-1, a pectate lyase gene; peh-1, a polygalacturonase gene; and celV, a cellulase gene), hrpNEcc (an E. carotovora subsp. carotovora gene specifying the elicitor of hypersensitive reaction), and rsmB in GacA+ and GacS+ E. carotovora subsp. carotovora strains. Similarly, the E. carotovora subsp. carotovora gacA gene stimulated csrB (rsmB) transcription in Escherichia coli. A GacS- mutant of E. carotovora subsp. carotovora strain AH2 and a GacA- mutant of E. carotovora subsp. carotovora strain Ecc71 compared with their parent strains produced very low levels of rsmB, pel-1, peh-1, celV, and hrpNEcc transcripts but produced similar levels of rsmA RNA and RsmA protein as well as transcripts of hyperproduction of extracellular enzymes (Hex) hexA, kdgR (repressor of genes for uronate and pectate catabolism), rsmC, and rpoS (gene for Sigma-S, an alternate Sigma factor). The levels of rsmB, pel-1, peh-1, celV, and hrpNEcc transcripts as well as production of pectate lyase, polygalacturonase, cellulase, protease, and HarpinEcc proteins were stimulated in GacS- and GacA- mutants by GacS+ or GacA+ plasmids, respectively. The GacA effect on exoenzyme genes and hrpNEcc was abrogated in E. carotovora subsp. carotovora mutants deficient in RsmA and RsmC or RsmA, RsmC, and rsmB RNA. The expression of lacZ transcriptional fusions of rsmB of Erwinia amylovora and Erwinia herbicola pv. gypsophilae was markedly reduced in a GacA- and a GacS- mutant of Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae. Southern blot hybridization revealed the presence of gacA and gacS homologs in all tested strains of soft-rotting Erwinia spp. and several nonsoft-rotting Erwinia species such as E. amylovora, E. rhapontici, E. herbicola, E. stewartii, and E. herbicola pv. gypsophilae. These findings establish that the GacA-GacS system controls transcription of rsmB of E. carotovora subsp. carotovora, E. amylovora, and E. herbicola pv. gypsophilae and support the hypothesis that the effects of this two-component system on extracellular protein production in E. carotovora subsp. carotovora is mediated, at least in part, via the levels of rsmB transcripts.
TI  - hexA of Erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora strain Ecc71 negatively regulates production of RpoS and rsmB RNA, a global regulator of extracellular proteins, plant virulence and the quorum-sensing signal, N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone.
AB  - The soft-rotting bacterium, Erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora (E. c. carotovora), produces an array of extracellular enzymes (= exoenzymes), including pectate lyase (Pel), polygalacturonase (Peh), cellulase (Cel) and protease (Prt), as well as HarpinEcc, the elicitor of hypersensitive reaction (HR). The production of these exoenzymes and HarpinEcc responds to plant products and the quorum-sensing signal [N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone; OHL] and is subject to both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. hexA of E. c. carotovora strain Ecc71 (hereafter hexA71), like that of another E. c. carotovora strain, negatively controls the production of exoenzymes, OHL and virulence in E. c. carotovora strain Ecc71. In addition to exoenzymes, HexA71 negatively regulates the expression of hrpNEcc, the structural gene for HarpinEcc. Exoenzyme overproduction is abolished by OHL deficiency in a HexA- and Ohll- double mutant, indicating that HexA and OHL are components of a common regulatory pathway controlling exoenzyme production. HexA71 negatively affects RpoS, as the levels of this alternative sigma factor are higher in the HexA- mutant than in the HexA+ strain. However, a HexA- and RpoS double mutant produces higher levels of exoenzymes and transcripts of pel-1, peh-1 and celVgenes than the HexA- and RpoS+ parent. Thus, the elevated levels of RpoS protein in the HexA- mutant do not account for exoenzyme overproduction. The following evidence associates for the first time the phenotypic changes in the HexA mutant to overproduction of rsmB RNA, a global regulator of exoenzymes, HarpinEcc, OHL and secondary metabolites. Analyses of rsmB transcripts and expression of an rsmB-lacZoperon fusion in E. c. carotovora strain Ecc71 revealed that HexA71 negatively regulates transcription of rsmB. Multiple copies of hexA71+ DNA suppress various phenotypes, including exoenzyme production in E. c. carotovora strain Ecc71, and concomitantly inhibit the production of rsmB, pel-1, peh-1, celV and hrpNEcc transcripts. Multiple copies of rsmB+ DNA, on the other hand, stimulate exoenzyme production by relieving the negative effects of a chromosomal copy of hexA+. The occurrence of hexA homologues and the negative effect of the dosage of hexA71 DNA on rsmB transcripts were also detected in other E. c. carotovora strains as well as Erwinia carotovora atroseptica and Erwinia carotovora betavasculorum. Extrapolating from the findings with LrhA, the Escherichia coli homologue of HexA, and the presence of sprE homologues in E. carotovora subspecies, we propose that HexA71 controls several regulatory pathways in E. carotovora including rsmB transcription and the production of SprEEcc which, in turn, affects RpoS levels. A model is presented that integrates the findings presented here and our current knowledge of the major regulatory network that controls exoprotein production in soft-rotting Erwinia carotovora subspecies.
TI  - Molecular characterization of global regulatory RNA species that control pathogenicity factors in Erwinia amylovora and Erwinia herbicola pv. gypsophilae.
AB  - rsmB(Ecc) specifies a nontranslatable RNA regulator that controls exoprotein production and pathogenicity in soft rot-causing Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora. This effect of rsmB(Ecc) RNA is mediated mostly by neutralizing the function of RsmA(Ecc), an RNA-binding protein of E. carotovora subsp. carotovora, which acts as a global negative regulator. To determine the occurrence of functional homologs of rsmB(Ecc) in non-soft-rot-causing Erwinia species, we cloned the rsmB genes of E. amylovora (rsmB(Ea)) and E. herbicola pv. gypsophilae (rsmB(Ehg)). We show that rsmB(Ea) in E. amylovora positively regulates extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) production, motility, and pathogenicity. In E. herbicola pv. gypsophilae, rsmB(Ehg) elevates the levels of transcripts of a cytokinin (etz) gene and stimulates the production of EPS and yellow pigment as well as motility. RsmA(Ea) and RsmA(Ehg) have more than 93% identity to RsmA(Ecc) and, like the latter, function as negative regulators by affecting the transcript stability of the target gene. The rsmB genes reverse the negative effects of RsmA(Ea), RsmA(Ehg), and RsmA(Ecc), but the extent of reversal is highest with homologous combinations of rsm genes. These observations and findings that rsmB(Ea) and rsmB(Ehg) RNA bind RsmA(Ecc) indicate that the rsmB effect is channeled via RsmA. Additional support for this conclusion comes from the observation that the rsmB genes are much more effective as positive regulators in a RsmA(+) strain of E. carotovora subsp. carotovora than in its RsmA(-) derivative. E. herbicola pv. gypsophilae produces a 290-base rsmB transcript that is not subject to processing. By contrast, E. amylovora produces 430- and 300-base rsmB transcripts, the latter presumably derived by processing of the primary transcript as previously noted with the transcripts of rsmB(Ecc). Southern blot hybridizations revealed the presence of rsmB homologs in E. carotovora, E. chrysanthemi, E. amylovora, E. herbicola, E. stewartii and E. rhapontici, as well as in other enterobacteria such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Serratia marcescens, Shigella flexneri, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Y. pseudotuberculosis. A comparison of rsmB sequences from several of these enterobacterial species revealed a highly conserved 34-mer region which is predicted to play a role in positive regulation by rsmB RNA.
TI  - Pantoea agglomerans strain EH318 produces two antibiotics that inhibit Erwinia amylovora in vitro.
AB  - Pantoea agglomerans (synonym: Erwinia herbicola) strain Eh318 produces through antibiosis a complex zone of inhibited growth in an overlay seeded with Erwinia amylovora, the causal agent of fire blight. This zone is caused by two antibiotics, named pantocin A and B. Using a genomic library of Eh318, two cosmids, pCPP702 and pCPP704, were identified that conferred on Escherichia coli the ability to inhibit growth of E. amylovora. The two cosmids conferred different antibiotic activities on E. coli DH5alpha and had distinct restriction enzyme profiles. A smaller, antibiotic-conferring DNA segment from each cosmid was cloned. Each subclone was characterized and mutagenized with transposons to generate clones that were deficient in conferring pantocin A and B production, respectively. Mutated subclones were introduced into Eh318 to create three antibiotic-defective marker exchange mutants: strain Eh421 (pantocin A deficient); strain Eh439 (pantocin B deficient), and Eh440 (deficient in both pantocins). Cross-hybridization results, restriction maps, and spectrum-of-activity data using the subclones and marker exchange mutants, supported the presence of two distinct antibiotics, pantocin A and pantocin B, whose biosynthetic genes were present in pCPP702 and pCPP704, respectively. The structure of pantocin A is unknown, whereas that of pantocin B has been determined as (R)-N-[((S)-2-amino-propanoylamino)-methyl]-2-methanesulfonyl-s uccina mic acid. The two pantocins mainly affect other enteric bacteria, based on limited testing.
TI  - Regulation of hrp genes and type III protein secretion in Erwinia amylovora by HrpX/HrpY, a novel two-component system, and HrpS.
AB  - Two novel regulatory components, hrpX and hrpY, of the hrp system of Erwinia amylovora were identified. The hrpXY operon is expressed in rich media, but its transcription is increased threefold by low pH, nutrient, and temperature levels--conditions that mimic the plant apoplast. hrpXY is autoregulated and directs the expression of hrpL; hrpL, in turn, activates transcription of other loci in the hrp gene cluster (Z.-M. Wei and S. V. Beer, J. Bacteriol. 177:6201-6210, 1995). The deduced amino -acid sequences of hrpX and hrpY are similar to bacterial two-component regulators including VsrA/VsrD of Pseudomonas (Ralstonia) solanacearum, DegS/DegU of Bacillus subtilis, and UhpB/UhpA and NarX/NarP, NarL of Escherichia coli. The N-terminal signal-input domain of HrpX contains PAS domain repeats. hrpS, located downstream of hrpXY, encodes a protein with homology to WtsA (HrpS) of Erwinia (Pantoea) stewartii, HrpR and HrpS of Pseudomonas syringae, and other delta54-dependent, enhancer-binding proteins. Transcription of hrpS also is induced under conditions that mimic the plant apoplast. However, hrpS is not autoregulated, and its expression is not affected by hrpXY. When hrpS or hrpL were provided on multicopy plasmids, both hrpX and hrpY mutants recovered the ability to elicit the hypersensitive reaction in tobacco. This confirms that hrpS and hrpL are not epistatic to hrpXY. A model of the regulatory cascades leading to the induction of the E. amylovora type III system is proposed.
TI  - cDNA cloning and characterization of a plant protein that may be associated with  the harpinPSS-mediated hypersensitive response.
AB  - Hypersensitive response-assisting protein (HRAP) is a novel plant protein that can intensify the harpinPSS-mediated hypersensitive response (HR) in harpinPSS-insensitive plants, such as the vegetative stage of sweet pepper. In this report, we identified a HRAP cDNA clone from sweet pepper (Capsicum annuum cv. ECW). The sequence of this cDNA clone showed no appreciable similarity to any other known sequences. However, it contained three positively charged regions, a typical signal peptide and a cAMP-dependent phosphorylation site. The hrap mRNA accumulated preferentially during the incompatible interaction of sweet pepper leaves with a pathogenic bacterium, Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae. When the hrap gene transcription level was high, the sweet pepper leaves readily expressed the harpinPSS-mediated HR. The hrap gene transcription level in sweet pepper was also higher during the reproductive stage than during the vegetative stage. The HRAP distribution in an individual plant and different plant species was investigated. We found that all the organs of sweet pepper, except fruit, could express two different forms of HRAP. Moreover, the hrap gene was presented in many plant species including tobacco, Arabidopsis, and rice. In conclusion, our results suggest that the hrap gene is widely distributed throughout the plant world and its transcription level correlates with plant sensitivity to harpinPSS. The interaction between HRAP and harpinPSS reveals a novel way to interpret the interaction mechanism between plants and bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Assembly and function of type III secretory systems.
AB  - Type III secretion systems allow Yersinia spp., Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Bordetella spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli adhering at the surface of a eukaryotic cell to inject bacterial proteins across the two bacterial membranes and the eukaryotic cell membrane to destroy or subvert the target cell. These systems consist of a secretion apparatus, made of approximately 25 proteins, and an array of proteins released by this apparatus. Some of these released proteins are "effectors," which are delivered into the cytosol of the target cell, whereas the others are "translocators," which help the effectors to cross the membrane of the eukaryotic cell. Most of the effectors act on the cytoskeleton or on intracellular-signaling cascades. A protein injected by the enteropathogenic E. coli serves as a membrane receptor for the docking of the bacterium itself at the surface of the cell. Type III secretion systems also occur in plant pathogens where they are involved both in causing disease in susceptible hosts and in eliciting the so-called hypersensitive response in resistant or nonhost plants. They consist of 15-20 Hrp proteins building a secretion apparatus and two groups of effectors: harpins and avirulence proteins. Harpins are presumably secreted in the extracellular compartment, whereas avirulence proteins are thought to be targeted into plant cells. Although a coherent picture is clearly emerging, basic questions remain to be answered. In particular, little is known about how the type III apparatus fits together to deliver proteins in animal cells. It is even more mysterious for plant cells where a thick wall has to be crossed. In spite of these haunting questions, type III secretion appears as a fascinating trans-kingdom communication device.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the levansucrase gene from Acetobacter xylinum NCI 1005.
AB  - The levansucrase gene (lsxA) was cloned from the genomic DNA of Acetobacter xylinum NCI 1005, and the nucleotide sequence of the lsxA gene (1,293 bp) was determined. The deduced amino acid sequence of the lsxA gene showed 57.4% and 46.2% identity with the levansucrases from Zymomonas mobilis and Erwinia amylovora, respectively, while only 35.2% identity with that from Acetobacter diazotrophicus. The gene product of lsxA (LsxA) that was overproduced in E. coli coded for a polypeptide of molecular mass 47 kDa. The LsxA released glucose and produced polysaccharide from sucrose, the structure of which was analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and determined to be a beta-(2,6)-linked polyfructan.
TI  - Molecular analysis of sucrose metabolism of Erwinia amylovora and influence on bacterial virulence.
AB  - Sucrose is an important storage and transport sugar of plants and an energy source for many phytopathogenic bacteria. To analyze regulation and biochemistry of sucrose metabolism of the fire blight pathogen Erwinia amylovora, a chromosomal fragment which enabled Escherichia coli to utilize sucrose as sole carbon source was cloned. By transposon mutagenesis, the scr regulon of E. amylovora was tagged, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. Five open reading frames, with the genes scrK, scrY, scrA, scrB, and scrR, had high homology to genes of the scr regulons from Klebsiella pneumoniae and plasmid pUR400. scrB and scrR of E. amylovora were fused to a histidine tag and to the maltose-binding protein (MalE) of E. coli, respectively. ScrB (53 kDa) catalyzed the hydrolysis of sucrose with a K(m) of 125 mM. Binding of a MalE-ScrR fusion protein to an scrYAB promoter fragment was shown by gel mobility shifts. This complex dissociated in the presence of fructose but not after addition of sucrose. Expression of the scr regulon was studied with an scrYAB promoter-green fluorescent protein gene fusion and measured by flow cytometry and spectrofluorometry. The operon was affected by catabolite repression and induced by sucrose or fructose. The level of gene induction correlated to the sucrose concentration in plant tissue, as shown by flow cytometry. Sucrose mutants created by site-directed mutagenesis did not produce significant fire blight symptoms on apple seedlings, indicating the importance of sucrose metabolism for colonization of host plants by E. amylovora.
TI  - The dual function in virulence and host range restriction of a gene isolated from the pPATH (Ehg) plasmid of Erwinia herbicola pv. gypsophilae.
AB  - The host range of the gall-forming bacterium Erwinia herbicola pv. gypsophilae (Ehg) is restricted to gypsophila whereas Erwinia herbicola pv. betae (Ehb) attacks beet as well as gypsophila. Both pathovars contain an indigenous plasmid (pPATH(Ehg or pPATH(Ehb)) that harbors pathogenicity genes, including the hrp gene cluster. A cosmid library of Ehg824-1 plasmid DNA was mobilized into Ehb4188 and the transconjugants were screened for pathogenicity on beet. One Ehb transconjugant harboring the cosmid pLA173 of pPATHEb induced a hypersensitive-like response and abolished pathogenicity on beet. Transposon mutagenesis of an open reading frame (ORF) located on this cosmid eliminated its affect on pathogenicity. Marker exchange of this mutation into Ehg824-1 caused a substantial reduction in gall size on gypsophila and caused Ehg824-1 to extend its host range and incite galls on beet. The ORF (1.5 kb) was designated as pthG (pathogenicity gene on gypsophila). DNA sequence analysis of pthG revealed no significant homology to known genes in the data bank. Only remnants of the pthG sequences were identified on the pPATH of Ehb4188. The deduced protein lacked an N-terminal signal peptide but contained a short trans-membrane helix in its C terminus. The gene product, as determined by expression in Escherichia coli and Western blots (immunoblots), was a 56-kDa protein.
TI  - Protein tyrosine kinases in bacterial pathogens are associated with virulence and production of exopolysaccharide.
AB  - In eukaryotes, tyrosine protein phosphorylation has been studied extensively, while in bacteria, it is considered rare and is poorly defined. We demonstrate that Escherichia coli possesses a gene, etk, encoding an inner membrane protein that catalyses tyrosine autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of a synthetic co-polymer poly(Glu:Tyr). This protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) was termed Ep85 or Etk. All the E.coli strains examined possessed etk; however, only a subset of pathogenic strains expressed it. Etk is homologous to several bacterial proteins including the Ptk protein of Acinetobacter johnsonii, which is the only other known prokaryotic PTK. Other Etk homologues are AmsA of the plant pathogen Erwinia amylovora and Orf6 of the human pathogen Klebsiella pneumoniae. These proteins are involved in the production of exopolysaccharide (EPS) required for virulence. We demonstrated that like Etk, AmsA and probably also Orf6 are PTKs. Taken together, these findings suggest that tyrosine protein phosphorylation in prokaryotes is more common than was appreciated previously, and that Etk and its homologues define a distinct protein family of prokaryotic membrane-associated PTKs involved in EPS production and virulence. These prokaryotic PTKs may serve as a new target for the development of new antibiotics.
TI  - Erwinia pyrifoliae sp. nov., a novel pathogen that affects Asian pear trees (Pyrus pyrifolia Nakai)
AB  - A novel pathogen from Asian pears (Pyrus pyrifolia Nakai) was analysed by sequencing the 16S rDNA and the adjacent intergenic region, and the data were compared to related Enterobacteriaceae. The 16S rDNA of the Asian pear pathogen was almost identical with the sequence of Erwinia amylovora, in contrast to the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic transcribed spacer region of both species. A dendrogram was deduced from determined sequences of the spacer regions including those of several related species such as Erwinia amylovora, Enterobacter pyrinus, Pantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii and Escherichia coli. Dendrograms derived from 121 biochemical characteristics including Biotype 100 data placed the Asian pear pathogen close to Erwinia amylovora and more distantly to other members of the species Erwinia and to the species Pantoea and Enterobacter. Another DNA relatedness study was performed by DNA hybridizations and estimation of delta Tm values. The Asian pear strains constituted a tight DNA hybridization group (89-100%) and were barely related to strains of Erwinia amylovora (40-50%) with a delta Tm in the range of 5.2-6.8. The G + C content of DNA from the novel pathogen is 52 mol%. Therefore, it is proposed that strains isolated from Asian pears constitute a new species and the name Erwinia pyrifoliae is suggested; the type strain is strain Ep 16/96T (= CFBP 4172T = DSM 12163T).
TI  - kdgREcc negatively regulates genes for pectinases, cellulase, protease, HarpinEcc, and a global RNA regulator in Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora.
AB  - Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora produces extracellular pectate lyase (Pel),  polygalacturonase (Peh), cellulase (Cel), and protease (Prt). The concerted actions of these enzymes largely determine the virulence of this plant-pathogenic bacterium. E. carotovora subsp. carotovora also produces HarpinEcc, the elicitor of the hypersensitive reaction. We document here that KdgREcc (Kdg, 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate; KdgR, general repressor of genes involved in pectin and galacturonate catabolism), a homolog of the E. chrysanthemi repressor, KdgREch and the Escherichia coli repressor, KdgREco, negatively controls not only the pectinases, Pel and Peh, but also Cel, Prt, and HarpinEcc production in E. carotovora subsp. carotovora. The levels of pel-1, peh-1, celV, and hrpNEcc transcripts are markedly affected by KdgREcc. The KdgREcc- mutant is more virulent than the KdgREcc+ parent. Thus, our data for the first time establish a global regulatory role for KdgREcc in E. carotovora subsp. carotovora. Another novel observation is the negative effect of KdgREcc on the transcription of rsmB (previously aepH), which specifies an RNA regulator controlling exoenzyme and HarpinEcc production. The levels of rsmB RNA are higher in the KdgREcc- mutant than in the KdgREcc+ parent. Moreover, by DNase I protection assays we determined that purified KdgREcc protected three 25-bp regions within the transcriptional unit of rsmB. Alignment of the protected sequences revealed the 21-mer consensus sequence of the KdgREcc-binding site as 5'-G/AA/TA/TGAAA[N6]TTTCAG/TG/TA-3'. Two such KdgREcc-binding sites occur in rsmB DNA in a close proximity to each other within nucleotides +79 and +139 and the third KdgREcc-binding site within nucleotides +207 and +231. Analysis of lacZ transcriptional fusions shows that the KdgR-binding sites negatively affect the expression of rsmB. KdgREcc also binds the operator DNAs of pel-1 and peh-1 genes and represses expression of a pel1-lacZ and a peh1-lacZ transcriptional fusions. We conclude that KdgREcc affects extracellular enzyme production by two ways: (i) directly, by inhibiting the transcription of exoenzyme genes; and (ii) indirectly, by preventing the production of a global RNA regulator. Our findings support the idea that KdgREcc affects transcription by promoter occlusion, i.e., preventing the initiation of transcription, and by a roadblock mechanism, i.e., by affecting the elongation of transcription.
TI  - Identification of an RcsA/RcsB recognition motif in the promoters of exopolysaccharide biosynthetic operons from Erwinia amylovora and Pantoea stewartii subspecies stewartii.
AB  - The regulation of capsule synthesis (Rcs) regulatory network is responsible for the induction of exopolysaccharide biosynthesis in many enterobacterial species. We have previously shown that two transcriptional regulators, RcsA and RcsB, do bind as a heterodimer to the promoter of amsG, the first reading frame in the operon for amylovoran biosynthesis in the plant pathogenic bacterium Erwinia amylovora. We now identified a 23-base pair fragment from position -555 to -533 upstream of the translational start site of amsG as sufficient for the specific binding of the Rcs proteins. In addition, we could detect an RcsA/RcsB-binding site in a corresponding region of the promoter of cpsA, the homologous counterpart to the E. amylovora amsG gene in the operon for stewartan biosynthesis of Pantoea stewartii. The specificity and characteristic parameters of the protein-DNA interaction were analyzed by DNA retardation, protein-DNA cross-linking, and directed mutagenesis. The central core motif TRVGAAWAWTSYG of the amsG promoter was found to be most important for the specific interaction with RcsA/RcsB, as evaluated by mutational analysis and an in vitro selection approach. The wild type P. stewartii Rcs binding motif is degenerated in two positions and an up-mutation according to our consensus motif resulted in about a 5-fold increased affinity of the RcsA/RcsB proteins.
TI  - Escherichia coli RcsA, a positive activator of colanic acid capsular polysaccharide synthesis, functions To activate its own expression.
AB  - Capsule (cps) gene expression in Escherichia coli is controlled by a complex network of regulators. Transcription of the cps operon is controlled by at least two positive regulators, RcsA and RcsB. We show here that RcsA functions to activate its own expression, as seen by the 100-fold-increased expression of a rcsA::lacZ transcriptional fusion in strains with high levels of RcsA protein, either due to a mutation in lon or due to overexpression of RcsA from a multicopy plasmid. Expression of the rcsA::lacZ fusion is increased by but not dependent on the presence of RcsB. In addition, the effects of H-NS and RcsB on the expression of rcsA are independent of each other. A sequence motif, conserved between the E. coli cps promoter and the Erwinia amylovora ams promoter and previously shown to be the RcsA-RcsB binding site, was identified in the rcsA promoter region and shown to be required for high-level expression of rcsA.
TI  - Cloning, nucleotide sequence, and expression in Escherichia coli of levansucrase  genes from the plant pathogens Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea and P. syringae pv. phaseolicola.
AB  - Plant-pathogenic bacteria produce various extracellular polysaccharides (EPSs) which may function as virulence factors in diseases caused by these bacteria. The EPS levan is synthesized by the extracellular enzyme levansucrase in Pseudomonas syringae, Erwinia amylovora, and other bacterial species. The lsc genes encoding levansucrase from P. syringae pv. glycinea PG4180 and P. syringae pv. phaseolicola NCPPB 1321 were cloned, and their nucleotide sequences were determined. Heterologous expression of the lsc gene in Escherichia coli was found in four and two genomic library clones of strains PG4180 and NCPPB 1321, respectively. A 3. 0-kb PstI fragment common to all six clones conferred levan synthesis on E. coli when further subcloned. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a 1,248-bp open reading frame (ORF) derived from PG4180 and a 1,296-bp ORF derived from NCPPB 1321, which were both designated lsc. Both ORFs showed high homology to the E. amylovora and Zymomonas mobilis lsc genes at the nucleic acid and deduced amino acid sequence levels. Levansucrase was not secreted into the supernatant but was located in the periplasmic fraction of E. coli harboring the lsc gene. Expression of lsc was found to be dependent on the vector-based Plac promoter, indicating that the native promoter of lsc was not functional in E. coli. Insertion of an antibiotic resistance cassette in the lsc gene abolished levan synthesis in E. coli. A PCR screening with primers derived from lsc of P. syringae pv. glycinea PG4180 allowed the detection of this gene in a number of related bacteria.
TI  - Characterization of a novel RNA regulator of Erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora that controls production of extracellular enzymes and secondary metabolites.
AB  - The enterobacterium Erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora strain 71 (hereafter Ecc71) produces extracellular enzymes such as pectate lyase isozymes (Pels), cellulase (Cel), polygalacturonase (Peh) and protease (Prt). These enzymes degrade plant cell wall components and are largely responsible for the elicitation of soft-rot diseases in plants and plant products. Ecc71 also produces HarpinEcc, the elicitor of hypersensitive reaction (HR) and the quorum-sensing signal, N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (OHL). OHL controls extracellular enzyme and HarpinEcc production. The levels of these enzymes, as well as the expression of hrpNEcc, the structural gene for HarpinEcc, and ohll, the gene specifying OHL synthesis, are negatively regulated by RsmaA. rsmB, formerly aepH, on the other hand, positively regulates extracellular enzyme production. 6His-RsmA recombinant protein purified from E. coli binds rsmB RNA as indicated by gel mobility shift assays. rsmB comprises 547 bp DNA, which is transcribed from a single start site immediately after a sigma70-like promoter. In Ecc71, two rsmB RNA species are detected: a full-length 479 base rsmB RNA and a 259 base rsmB' RNA. rsmB' DNA hybridizes with the 259 base and the 479 base transcripts. A 3' RNase protection assay revealed that the 259 base and the 479 base RNA species end at the same position immediately after the putative rho-independent terminator. The expression of rsmB-lacZ transcriptional fusions established that the rsmB' RNA is not produced because of the activation of an internal promoter. These data strongly suggest that the 259 base rsmB' RNA is derived by processing of the primary rsmB RNA. In Ecc71, rsmB' expression driven by the lac promoter causes overproduction of Pel, Peh, Cel and Prt, and accumulation of pel-1, peh-1, hrpNEcc and ohll transcripts. By contrast, a plasmid with the rsmB' DNA sequence deleted fails to cause overproduction of the extracellular enzymes in Ecc71. The rsmB' effect also occurs in Escherichia coli as glycogen accumulation is stimulated in the presence of rsmB'. In vivo and in vitro translation as well as mutational analysis of rsmB' have established that rsmB' RNA does not yield a translational product. Therefore, we concluded that the rsmB' RNA itself functions as the regulator. Indeed, the expression rsmB' DNA leads to neutralization of the negative effects of the RNA-binding protein, RsmA, in Ecc71 and Serratia marcescens strain SM274. We propose a model that explains how RsmA and rsmB control the expression of genes for extracellular enzymes.
TI  - RpoS (sigma-S) controls expression of rsmA, a global regulator of secondary metabolites, harpin, and extracellular proteins in Erwinia carotovora.
AB  - RpoS (sigma-S or sigma-38) controls a large array of genes that are expressed during stationary phase and under various stress conditions in Escherichia coli and other bacteria. We document here that plant pathogenic and epiphytic Erwinia species, such as E. amylovora; E. carotovora subsp. atroseptica, betavasculorum, and carotovora; E. chrysanthemi; E. herbicola; E. rhapontici; and E. stewartii, possess rpoS genes and produce the alternate sigma factor. We show that rpoS transcription in E. carotovora subsp. carotovora is driven from a major promoter which resides within the nlpD gene located upstream of rpoS as in E. coli. RpoS- E. carotovora subsp. carotovoa strain AC5061, constructed by marker exchange, is more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide, carbon starvation, and acidic pH than its RpoS+ parent strain, AC5006. The basal levels of extracellular pectate lyase, polygalacturonase, and cellulase as well as those of transcripts of E. carotovora subsp. carotovora hrpN (hrpNEcc), the gene for the elicitor of the hypersensitive reaction, are higher in the RpoS- strain than in the RpoS+ parent. Likewise, compared to AC5006, AC5061 causes more extensive maceration of celery petioles. Our findings with the RpoS- mutant and strains carrying multiple copies rpoS+ DNA reveal that rpoS positively controls rsmA expression. We also present evidence that supports the hypothesis that the RpoS effect on extracellular enzyme levels, hrpNEcc expression, and virulence manifests itself by the modulation of rsmA expression.
TI  - The gut of the soil microarthropod Folsomia candida (Collembola) is a frequently  changeable but selective habitat and a vector for microorganisms.
AB  - Interaction potentials between soil microarthropods and microorganisms were investigated with Folsomia candida (Insecta, Collembola) in microcosm laboratory experiments. Microscopic analysis revealed that the volumes of the simple, rod-shaped guts of adult specimens varied with their feeding activity, from 0.7 to 11.2 nl. A dense layer of bacterial cells, associated with the peritrophic membrane, was detected in the midgut by scanning electron microscopy. Depending on the molting stage, which occurred at intervals of approximately 4 days, numbers of heterotrophic, aerobic gut bacteria changed from 4.9 x 10(2) to 2.3 x 10(6) CFU per specimen. A total of 11 different taxonomic bacterial groups and the filamentous fungus Acremonium charticola were isolated from the guts of five F. candida specimens. The most abundant isolate was related to Erwinia amylovora (96.2% DNA sequence similarity to its 16S rRNA gene). F. candida preferred to feed on Pseudomonas putida and three indigenous gut isolates rather than eight different type culture strains. When luciferase reporter gene-tagged bacterial strains were pulse fed to F. candida, gut isolates were continuously shed for 8 days to several weeks but Escherichia coli HB101 was shed for only 1 day. Ratios of ingested to released bacterial cells demonstrated that populations of nonindigenous gut bacteria like Sinorhizobium meliloti L33 and E. coli HB101 were reduced by more than 4 orders of magnitude but that the population of gut isolate Alcaligenes faecalis HR4 was reduced only 500-fold. This work demonstrates that F. candida represents a frequently changeable but selective habitat for bacteria in terrestrial environments and that microarthropods have to be considered factors that modify soil microbial communities.
TI  - Antibiotic production by Erwinia herbicola Eh1087: its role in inhibition of Erwinia amylovora and partial characterization of antibiotic biosynthesis genes.
AB  - Mutants of Erwinia herbicola Eh1087 (Ant-), which did not produce antibiotic activity against Erwinia amylovora, the fire blight pathogen, were selected after TnphoA mutagenesis. In immature pear fruit Ant- mutants grew at the same rate as wild-type strain Eh1087 but did not suppress development of the disease caused by E. amylovora. These results indicated that antibiosis plays an important role in the suppression of disease by strain Eh1087. All of the Ant- mutations obtained were located in a 2.2-kb region on a 200-kb indigenous plasmid. Sequence analysis of the mutated DNA region resulted in identification of six open reading frames, designated ORF1 through ORF6, four of which were essential to antibiotic expression. One gene was identified as a gene which encodes a translocase protein which is probably involved in antibiotic secretion. A sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of plasmid proteins produced in Escherichia coli minicells confirmed the presence of proteins whose sizes corresponded to the sizes of the predicted open reading frame products.
TI  - Erwinia amylovora secretes DspE, a pathogenicity factor and functional AvrE homolog, through the Hrp (type III secretion) pathway.
AB  - Erwinia amylovora was shown to secrete DspE, a pathogenicity factor of 198 kDa and a functional homolog of AvrE of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato. DspE was identified among the supernatant proteins isolated from cultures grown in an hrp gene-inducing minimal medium by immunodetection with a DspE-specific antiserum. Secretion required an intact Hrp pathway.
TI  - Genetics of sorbitol metabolism in Erwinia amylovora and its influence on bacterial virulence.
AB  - A chromosomal DNA fragment from Erwinia amylovora was identified that complemented a deletion mutant in the gut(srl) operon of Escherichia coli. The E. amylovora srl operon on the cloned fragment was localized by transposon mutagenesis. A DNA fragment including the srl genes of E. amylovora was sequenced and found to contain six open reading frames (ORFs). These ORFs were highly homologous to genes of the gut operon of E. coli. No large gene was found that encoded a protein equivalent to GutA of E. coli; instead two ORFs with extensive similarity to GutA were identified in the E. amylovora srl operon. All transposon insertions were mapped by PCR analysis, and several insertions in a plasmid bearing the srl operon were unable to complement a mutation in the E. coli gutD gene. All E. amylovora srl mutants could be complemented by introducing the sorbitol operon from E. coli. The direction of transcription was confirmed by analysis of lacZ fusions. Expression of the srl operon in E. amylovora was high in the presence of sorbitol in the medium and was repressed by glucose. Mutants with a sorbitol deficiency were still virulent on slices of immature pears, but were unable to cause significant fire blight symptoms on apple shoots. Since sorbitol is used for carbohydrate transport in host plants of E. amylovora, this sugar alcohol may be an important factor in determining host specificity for the fire blight pathogen.
TI  - Interaction of the regulator proteins RcsA and RcsB with the promoter of the operon for amylovoran biosynthesis in Erwinia amylovora.
AB  - The RcsA and RcsB proteins of Erwinia amylovora and Escherichia coli were expressed in E. coli and purified. Their DNA-binding activity was examined using a 1-kb DNA region containing the putative promoter of the ams operon of Ew. amylovora, which is responsible for the biosynthesis of the exopolysaccharide amylovoran. Mobility shift assays indicated specific binding of RcsA and RcsB to a region of 78 bp spanning nucleotide positions -578 to -501 relative to the translational start of the first open reading frame of the operon. This region includes stretches of homology to E. coli sigma 70 promoter consensus sequences and to the E. coli cps promoter region. Binding of the Rcs proteins was not found at a JUMPstart consensus, typical for various promoters of polysaccharide gene clusters. DNA-binding activity was not detected for RcsA alone and only high concentrations of RcsB were able to interact with the ams promoter in our assay. The two proteins bind cooperatively at the indicated region of the ams promoter and further evidence is provided showing that the DNA-protein complex formed involves a heterodimer of RcsA and RcsB. The specific activity of RcsA, but not of RcsB, was enhanced when the protein was expressed in E. coli at 28 degrees C, relative to expression at 37 degrees C. In addition, DNA-protein complex formation is affected by temperature. The E. coli RcsA/RcsB proteins bind to the same region of the ams promoter and are able to interact with the Rcs proteins from Ew. amylovora.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of Erwinia species based on 16S rRNA gene sequences.
AB  - The phylogenetic relationships of the type strains of 16 Erwinia species were investigated by performing a comparative analysis of the sequences of the 16S rRNA genes of these organisms. The sequence data were analyzed by the neighbor-joining method, and each branch was supported by moderate bootstrap values. The phylogenetic tree and sequence analyses confirmed that the genus Erwinia is composed of species that exhibit considerable heterogeneity and form four clades that are intermixed with members of other genera, such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens. Cluster I includes the type strains of Erwinia herbicola, Erwinia milletiae, Erwinia ananas, Erwinia uredovora, and Erwinia stewartii and corresponds to Dye's herbicola group. Cluster II consists of Erwinia persicinus, Erwinia rhapontici, Erwinia amylovora, and Erwinia cypripedii. Cluster III consists of Erwinia carotovora subspecies and Erwinia chrysanthemi and is characterized by the production of pectate lyases and cellulases. Erwinia salicis, Erwinia rubrifaciens, and Erwinia nigrifluens form the cluster that is most distantly related to other Erwinia species. The data from the sequence analyses are discussed in the context of biochemical and DNA-DNA hybridization data.
TI  - Molecular characterization and expression of the Erwinia carotovora hrpNEcc gene, which encodes an elicitor of the hypersensitive reaction.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of hrpNEcc DNA, cloned from Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora strain Ecc71, reveals a coding region of 1,068 bp which matches the size of hrpNEcc transcripts. hrpNEcc is predicted to encode a glycine-rich protein of approximately 36 kDa. Like the elicitors of the hypersensitive reaction (HR) produced by E. chrysanthemi (HarpinEch) and E. amylovora (HarpinEa), the deduced 36-kDa protein does not possess a typical signal sequence, but it contains a putative membrane-spanning domain. In Escherichia coli strains overexpressing hrpNEcc, the 36-kDa protein has been identified as the hrpNEcc product by Western blot analysis using anti-HarpinEch antibodies. The 36-kDa protein fractionated from E. coli elicits the HR in tobacco leaves. Moreover, a HrpN- and RsmA- double mutant (RsmA = regulator of secondary metabolites) does not produce this 36-kDa protein or elicit the HR, although this strain, like the RsmA- and HrpN+ bacteria, overproduces extracellular enzymes and macerates celery petioles. These observations demonstrate that hrpNEcc encodes the elicitor of the HR, designated HarpinEcc. The levels of hrpNEcc transcripts are affected in both RsmA+ and RsmA- strains by media composition and carbon sources, although the mRNA levels are substantially higher in the RsmA- strains. The expression of hrpNEcc in Ecc71 is cell density dependent and is activated by the quorum-sensing signal, N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (OHL). By contrast, hrpNEcc expression in an RsmA- strain is independent of cell density, and substantial expression occurs in the absence of OHL. The effects of cultural conditions and the occurrence of putative cis-acting sequences, such as consensus sigma 54 promoters and an hrp promoter upstream of the transcriptional start site, indicate that the production of HarpinEcc in wild-type RsmA+ E. carotovora subsp. carotovora is tightly regulated. These observations, taken along with the finding that the HR is caused by RsmA- mutants but not by RsmA+ strains (Cui et al., 1996, Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 9:565-573), strongly support the idea that the inability of the wild-type pectolytic E. carotovora subsp. carotovora to elicit the HR is due to the lack of a significant level of HarpinEcc production.
TI  - The hrpA and hrpC operons of Erwinia amylovora encode components of a type III pathway that secretes harpin.
AB  - A 6.2-kb region of DNA corresponding to complementation groups II and III of the  Erwinia amylovora hrp gene cluster was analyzed. Transposon mutagenesis indicated that the two complementation groups are required for secretion of harpin, an elicitor of the hypersensitive reaction. The sequence of the region revealed 10 open reading frames in two putative transcription units: hrpA, hrpB, hrcJ, hrpD, and hrpE in the hrpA operon (group III) and hrpF, hrpG, hrcC, hrpT, and hrpV in the hrpC operon (group II). From promoter regions of the hrpA, hrpC, and hrpN operons, sequences similar to those of the HrpL-dependent promoters of Pseudomonas syringae pathovars were identified with a consensus sequence of 5'-GGAAC-N17-18-CACTNAA-3'. The protein products of seven genes, hrpA, hrcJ, hrpE, hrpF, hrpG, hrcC, and hrpV, were visualized with a T7 polymerase/promoter expression system. HrcC, HrcJ, and HrpT sequences contained potential signal peptides, and HrcC appeared to be envelope associated based on a TnphoA translational fusion. Comparison of deduced amino acid sequences indicated that many of the proteins are homologous to proteins that function in the type III protein secretion pathway. HrcC is a member of the YscC-containing subgroup in the PulD/pIV superfamily of outer membrane proteins. HrcJ is a member of a lipoprotein family that includes YscJ of Yersinia spp., MxiJ of Shigella flexneri, and NolT of Rhizobim fredii. Additional similarities were detected between HrpB and YscI and between HrpE and YscL. HrcJ and HrpE were similar to flagellar biogenesis proteins FliF and FliH, respectively. In addition, HrpA, HrpB, HrcJ, HrpD, HrpE, HrpF, and HrcC showed various degrees of similarity to corresponding proteins of P. syringae. Comparison of hrp clusters with respect to gene organization and similarity of individual proteins confirms that the hrp systems of E. amylovora and P. syringae are closely related to each other and distinct from those of Ralstonia (Pseudomonas) solanacearum and Xanthomonas campestris. Possible implications of extensive similarities between the E. amylovora and P. syringae hrp systems in pathogenesis mechanisms are discussed.
TI  - Characterization of the rcsB gene from Erwinia amylovora and its influence on exoploysaccharide synthesis and virulence of the fire blight pathogen.
AB  - RcsB belongs to a family of positive regulators of exopolysaccharide synthesis in various enterobacteria. The rcsB gene of the fire blight pathogen Erwinia amylovora was cloned by PCR amplification with consensus primers, and its role in exopolysaccharide (EPS) synthesis was investigated. Its overexpression from high-copy-number plasmids stimulated the synthesis of the acidic EPS amylovoran and suppressed expression of the levan-forming enzyme levansucrase. Inactivation of rcsB by site-directed mutagenesis created mutants that were deficient in amylovoran synthesis and avirulent on host plants. In addition, a cosmid which complemented rcsB mutants was selected from a genomic library. The spontaneous E. amylovora mutant E8 has a similar phenotype and was complemented by the cloned rcsB gene. The rcsB region of strain E8 was also amplified by PCR, and the mutation was characterized as a nine-nucleotide deletion at the start of the rcsB gene. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the E. amylovora rcsB region and the predicted amino acid sequence of RcsB revealed extensive homology to rcsB and the encoded protein of other bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Erwinia stewartii. In all three organisms, rcsB is localized adjacent to the rcsC gene, which is transcribed in the opposite direction of rcsB. The E. amylovora rcsB gene has now been shown to strongly affect the formation of disease symptoms of a plant pathogen.
TI  - Characterization of the amsI gene product as a low molecular weight acid phosphatase controlling exopolysaccharide synthesis of Erwinia amylovora.
AB  - The ams region, responsible for amylovoran synthesis of the fireblight pathogen Erwinia amylovora, contains the gene amsI encoding a 144 amino acid protein with homology to mammalian low molecular weight acid phosphatases [Bugert and Geider (1995) Mol. Microbiol. 15, 917-9331. A DNA fragment with amsI was cloned under the control of the lac promoter on a high copy number plasmid. The gene product of amsl is about 17 kDa in a protein expression system and had the enzymatic activity of an acid phosphatase. This is the first report about a low molecular weight acid phosphatase activity in prokaryotes. As part of the large ams transcript, expression of amsI was affected by the activator proteins RcsA and RcsB. Overexpression of amsI in E. amylovora caused a strong increase of acid phosphatase activity, but additionally a strong reduction in EPS synthesis, phenotypically similar to a mutation in the gene. The gene product may participate in changes of phosphorylation required for the biosynthesis of EPS such as recycling the lipid carrier diphosphate to the monophosphate form.
TI  - Identification of the promoter region for the colanic acid polysaccharide biosynthetic genes in Escherichia coli K-12.
AB  - The colanic acid polysaccharide capsule biosynthetic genes (cps genes) are primarily clustered at one site located at about 45 min on the Escherichia coli chromosome. The network of proteins involved in regulating the expression of these genes includes the two positive regulators RcsA and RcsB. This work describes the site of action of these two activator proteins and the promoter of the cps genes. It is likely that the cps genes are arranged in a single long operon that is at least 13.5 kb. The promoter region was identified with fusions to lacZ that resulted in regulated expression by the Rcs network of regulatory proteins, and the start site of transcription was identified by primer extension. The operator region was cloned from Kohara phage to multicopy plasmids and identified by titrating RcsA or RcsB. Sequence analysis of the promoter and operator region revealed homology to the JUMPstart element found in the untranslated region of many exopolysaccharide biosynthetic operons. In addition, the deduced amino acid sequence of the amino terminus of the first open reading frame of the cps operon was found to be homologous to proteins encoded by the exopolysaccharide biosynthetic operons of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Erwinia amylovora.
TI  - Molecular characterization of the levansucrase gene from the endophytic sugarcane bacterium Acetobacter diazotrophicus SRT4.
AB  - The Acetobacter diazotrophicus SRT4 gene encoding levansucrase (EC 2.4.1.10) (IsdA) was isolated from a genomic library. The nucleotide sequence of a 2.3 kb DNA fragment sufficient for complementation of a levansucrase-deficient mutant (obtained by EMS treatment) was determined. The IsdA gene (1751 bp) coded for a polypeptide of molecular mass 64.9 kDa with an isoelectric point of 5.2. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the extracellular levansucrase indicated the presence of a precursor protein with a putative signal sequence of 51 residues which is possibly cleaved in two successive steps. Expression of the IsdA gene from the lac promoter in Escherichia coli resulted in the production of a protein with levansucrase activity. The deduced amino acid sequence of the IsdA gene was 48% and 46% identical with the levansucrases from the Gram-negative bacteria Zymomonas mobilis and Erwinia amylovora, respectively, but only 28-31% identical with levansucrases from Gram-positive bacteria. Multiple alignments of published levansucrase sequences from Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria revealed eight conserved motifs. A comparison of the catalytic properties and the sequence of the A. diazotrophicus levansucrase with those of the Bacillus subtilis levansucrase suggested that one of these motifs may be involved in the specificity of the synthetized product. Disruption of the IsdA gene in the genome of A. diazotrophicus resulted in a mutant lacking both levansucrase activity and the ability to utilize sucrose as a carbon source, suggesting that levansucrase is the key enzyme in sucrose metabolism of A. diazotrophicus.
TI  - Desferrioxamine-dependent iron transport in Erwinia amylovora CFBP1430: cloning of the gene encoding the ferrioxamine receptor FoxR.
AB  - Iron deprivation of Erwinia amylovora CFBP1430, a species causing fire blight on  Pomoideae, was shown to induce the production of siderophores of the desferrioxamine (dfo) family and two outer membrane polypeptides with apparent molecular weight of about 70 and 80 kDa, respectively. Cyclic dfo E was characterized as the major metabolite. Phage MudIIpR13 insertional mutagenesis and screening on CAS-agar medium yielded three dfo non-producing and one overproducing clones. These clones failed to grow in the presence of the Fe(III) chelator EDDHA and were determined further as dfo and ferrioxamine transport negative mutants, respectively. The transport mutant which appeared to lack the 70 kDa polypeptide in the outer membrane allowed the purification of dfo E. Growth under iron limitation of dfo negative mutants was stimulated with ferrioxamine E and B but not with other ferrisiderophores tested. The host DNA sequence flanking the left terminal part of the MudIIpR13 prophage responsible for the transport mutation was cloned and used to probe a parental gene library by DNA-DNA hybridization. Two recombinant cosmids restoring the transport mutation to normal were identified. Both cosmids also conferred the ability to utilize ferrioxamine B and E as iron sources on a FhuE- mutant of Escherichia coli. This correlated with the production of an additional polypeptide of 70 kDa in the outer membrane of E. coli transconjugants, thus confirming that this protein serves the ferrioxamine receptor function (FoxR) in E. amylovora.
TI  - Erwinia amylovora secretes harpin via a type III pathway and contains a homolog of yopN of Yersinia spp.
AB  - Type III secretion functions in flagellar biosynthesis and in export of virulence factors from several animal pathogens, and for plant pathogens, it has been shown to be involved in the export of elicitors of the hypersensitive reaction. Typified by the Yop delivery system of Yersinia spp., type III secretion is sec independent and requires multiple components. Sequence analysis of an 11.5-kb region of the hrp gene cluster of Erwinia amylovora containing hrpI, a previously characterized type III gene, revealed a group of eight or more type III genes corresponding to the virB or lcrB (yscN-to-yscU) locus of Yersinia spp. A homolog of another Yop secretion gene, yscD, was found between hrpI and this group downstream. Immediately upstream of hrpI, a homolog of yopN was discovered. yopN is a putative sensor involved in host-cell-contact-triggered expression and transfer of protein, e.g., YopE, to the host cytoplasm. In-frame deletion mutagenesis of one of the type III genes, designated hrcT, was nonpolar and resulted in a Hrp- strain that produced but did not secrete harpin, an elicitor of the hypersensitive reaction that is also required for pathogenesis. Cladistic analysis of the HrpI (herein renamed HrcV) or LcrD protein family revealed two distinct groups for plant pathogens. The Yersinia protein grouped more closely with the plant pathogen homologs than with homologs from other animal pathogens; flagellar biosynthesis proteins grouped distinctly. A possible evolutionary history of type III secretion is presented, and the potential significance of the similarity between the harpin and Yop export systems is discussed, particularly with respect to a potential role for the YopN homolog in pathogenesis of plants.
TI  - Global regulation in Erwinia species by Erwinia carotovora rsmA, a homologue of Escherichia coli csrA: repression of secondary metabolites, pathogenicity and hypersensitive reaction.
AB  - Our previous studies revealed that rsmA of Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora strain 71 suppressed the synthesis of the cell density (quorum) sensing signal N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone, the production of extracellular enzymes and tissue macerating ability in soft-rotting Erwinia species and that homologues of this negative regulator gene were present in other Erwinia species. Northern blot data presented here demonstrate that rsmA and rsmA-like genes are also expressed in soft-rotting and non-soft-rotting Erwinia spp. such as E. amylovora, E. carotovora subsp. atroseptica, E. carotovora subsp. betavasculorum, E. carotovora subsp. carotovora, E. chrysanthemi, E. herbicola and E. stewartii. A low-copy plasmid carrying rsmA of E. carotovora subsp. carotovora strain 71 caused suppression of antibiotic production in E. carotovora subsp. betavasculorum, flagellum formation in E. carotovora subsp. carotovora, carotenoid production in E. herbicola and E. stewartii, and indigoidine production in E. chrysanthemi. In E. amylovora, rsmA of E. carotovora subsp. carotovora suppressed the elicitation of the hypersensitive reaction in tobacco leaves and the production of disease symptoms in apple shoots, in addition to repressing motility and extracellular polysaccharide production. We conclude that rsmA homologues function as global regulators of secondary metabolic pathways as well as factors controlling host interaction of Erwinia species.
TI  - Erwinia chrysanthemi harpinEch: an elicitor of the hypersensitive response that contributes to soft-rot pathogenesis.
AB  - Mutants of the soft-rot pathogen Erwinia chrysanthemi EC16 that are deficient in  the production of the pectate lyase isozymes PelABCE can elicit the hypersensitive response (HR) in tobacco leaves. The hrpNEch gene was identified in a collection of cosmids carrying E. chrysanthemi hrp genes by its hybridization with the Erwinia amylovora hrpNEa gene. hrpNEch appears to be in a monocistronic operon, and it encodes a predicted protein of 340 amino acids that is glycine-rich, lacking in cysteine, and highly similar to HrpNEa in its C-terminal half. Escherichia coli DH5 alpha cells expressing hrpNEch from the lac promoter of pBluescript II accumulated HrpNEch in inclusion bodies. The protein was readily purified from cell lysates carrying these inclusion bodies by solubilization in 4.5 M guanidine-HCl and reprecipitation upon dialysis against dilute buffer. HrpNEch suspensions elicited a typical HR in tobacco leaves, and elicitor activity was heat-stable. Tn5-gusA1 mutations were introduced into the cloned hrpNEch and then marker-exchanged into the genomes of E. chrysanthemi strains AC4150 (wild type), CUCPB5006 (delta pelABCE), and CUCPB5030 (delta pelABCE outD::TnphoA). hrpNEch::Tn5-gusA1 mutations in CUCPB5006 abolished the ability of the bacterium to elicit the HR in tobacco leaves unless complemented with an hrpNEch subclone. An hrpNEch::Tn5-gusA1 mutation also reduced the ability of AC4150 to incite infections in witloof chicory leaves, but it did not reduce the size of lesions that did develop. Purified HrpNEch and E. chrysanthemi strains CUCPB5006 and CUCPB5030 elicited HR-like necrosis in leaves of tomato, pepper, African violet, petunia, and pelargonium, whereas hrpNEch mutants did not.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Identification of the fire blight pathogen, Erwinia amylovora, by PCR assays with chromosomal DNA.
AB  - Erwinia amylovora, the causative agent of fire blight, was identified independently from the common plasmid pEA29 by three different PCR assays with chromosomal DNA. PCR with two primers was performed with isolated DNA and with whole cells, which were directly added to the assay mixture. The oligonucleotide primers were derived from the ams region, and the PCR product comprised the amsB gene, which is involved in exopolysaccharide synthesis. The amplified fragment of 1.6 kb was analyzed, and the sequence was found to be identical for two E. amylovora strains. The identity of the PCR products was further confirmed by restriction analysis. The 1.6-kb signal was also used for detection of the fire blight pathogen in the presence of other plant-associated bacteria and in infected plant tissue. For further identification of isolated strains, the 16S rRNA gene of E. amylovora and other plant-associated bacteria was amplified and the products were digested with the restriction enzyme HaeIII. The pattern obtained for E. amylovora was different from that of other bacteria. The sequence of the 16S rRNA gene was determined from a cloned fragment and was found to be closely related to the sequences of Escherichia coli and other Erwinia species. Finally, arbitrarily primed PCR with a 17-mer oligonucleotide derived from the sequence of transposon Tn5 produced a unique banding pattern for all E. amylovora strains investigated. These methods expand identification methods for E. amylovora, which include DNA hybridization and a PCR technique based on plasmid pEA29.
TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of the extracellular sucrase gene (sacC) of Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - The Zymomonas mobilis gene sacC that encodes the extracellular sucrase (protein B46) was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The gene was found to be present downstream to the already described levansucrase gene sacB in the cloned chromosomal fragment of Z. mobilis. The expression product was different from SacB and exhibited sucrase but not levansucrase activity; therefore, SacC behaves like a true sucrase. Expression of sacC in E. coli JM109 and XL1 was very low; overexpression was observed in E. coli BL21 after induction of the T7 polymerase expression system with IPTG. Subcellular fractionation of the E. coli clone carrying plasmid pLSS2811 showed that more than 70% of the sucrase activity could be detected in the cytoplasmic fraction, suggesting that the enzyme was soluble and not secreted in E. coli. The nucleotide sequence analysis of sacC revealed an open reading frame 1239bp long coding for a 413 amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 46 kDa. The first 30 deduced amino acids from this ORF were identical with those from the N-terminal sequence of the extracellular sucrase (protein B46) purified from Z. mobilis ZM4. No leader peptide sequence could be identified in the sacC gene. The amino acid sequence of SacC showed very little similarity to those of other known sucrases, but was very similar to the levansucrases of Z. mobilis (61.5%), Erwinia amylovora (40.2%) and Bacillus subtilis (25.6%).
TI  - Molecular analysis of the ams operon required for exopolysaccharide synthesis of  Erwinia amylovora.
AB  - A 16 kb transcript of the ams region, which is essential for biosynthesis of amylovoran, the acidic exopolysaccharide of Erwinia amylovora, was detected by Northern hybridization analysis. The positive regulator RcsA enhanced transcription of the large mRNA from the ams operon. The nucleotide sequence of this area revealed 12 open reading frames (ORFs), which are all transcribed in the same direction. Five ORFs corresponded to the previously mapped genes amsA to amsE. Sequence analysis of the insertion sites of several Tn5 mutations confirmed these data. Tn5 or site-directed mutagenesis of the ORFs 477, 377, 144, and 743 revealed an amylovoran-deficient phenotype, and the newly identified genes were named amsG, amsH, amsI, and amsF, respectively. The predicted amino acid sequence of AmsG is highly homologous to galactosyl-1-phosphate undecaprenylphosphate transferases. AmsB and AmsD are similar to other glycosyl transferases, and AmsH may be related to BexD. A significant homology to mammalian phosphatases was observed for AmsI. AmsA shows characteristic motifs for membrane association and ATP binding. AmsF carries a secretory signal sequence in the N-terminus and could be involved in periplasmic processing of the repeating units. Complementation experiments located a promoter region required for gene expression as far as 500 bp upstream of amsG. It is preceded by a typical transcriptional termination sequence. A mutation upstream of the terminator did not affect amylovoran synthesis. Partial nucleotide sequences further upstream of the ams region showed homology to genes mapped at 45 min on the Escherichia coli chromosome. A termination sequence was also found downstream of the ams operon at a distance of 16 kb from the promoter. Between amsF and this terminator, three additional ORFs were detected.
TI  - Cloning, expression, and characterization of the lon gene of Erwinia amylovora: evidence for a heat shock response.
AB  - The gene encoding the Lon protease of Erwinia amylovora has been cloned by complementation of an Escherichia coli lon mutant. Analysis of the determined nucleotide sequence of the lon gene revealed extensive homology to the nucleotide sequences of cloned lon genes from E. coli, Myxococcus xanthus, and Bacillus brevis. The predicted amino acid sequence of the E. amylovora Lon protease was 94, 59, and 54% identical to the predicted amino acid sequences of the Lon proteases of E. coli, M. xanthus, and B. brevis, respectively. The -10 and -35 promoter regions of the cloned lon gene had extensive homology to the respective consensus sequences of E. coli heat shock promoters. Promoter mapping of the lon gene located the start site 7 bases downstream of the -10 region. Cloning of the lon promoter upstream of a cat reporter gene demonstrated that expression of the E. amylovora lon gene was inducible by a heat shock. This is the first demonstration of a heat shock-regulated gene in E. amylovora. Site-directed mutagenesis of the -10 region of the lon promoter confirmed that the heat shock expression of the E. amylovora lon gene may be mediated by a sigma 32-like factor. Insertional inactivation of the E. amylovora chromosomal lon gene confirmed that the lon gene was not essential for either vegetative growth or infection of apple seedlings. E. amylovora lon mutants had increased sensitivity to UV irradiation and elevated levels of extracellular polysaccharide, suggesting comparable roles for the Lon proteases in both E. amylovora and E. coli.
TI  - Expression and identification of the strA-strB gene pair from streptomycin-resistant Erwinia amylovora.
AB  - Deletions in either of the genes in the strA-strB gene pair of Erwinia amylovora  plasmid pEa34 resulted in a dramatic decrease in streptomycin resistance (SmR), but SmR was restored to high levels by complementation. When strA and strB were cloned separately on a lacIq/Ptac-based expression vector in Escherichia coli, only the protein encoded by strA was produced. When a strong Shine-Dalgarno sequence was introduced and the start codon was located outside the double-stranded region of the stable stem-loop, the protein encoded by strB was produced. Biochemical analysis of the respective phosphorylated products demonstrated that strA and strB encoded aminoglycoside-3"-phosphotransferase (APH(3")-Ib) and aminoglycoside-6-phosphotransferase (APH(6)-Id), respectively. These data suggest that the high-level SmR in bacteria containing strA and strB is due to the combined action of the two enzymes.
TI  - Erwinia chrysanthemi hrp genes and their involvement in soft rot pathogenesis and elicitation of the hypersensitive response.
AB  - Unlike the bacterial pathogens that typically cause the hypersensitive response (HR) in plants, Erwinia chrysanthemi has a wide host range, rapidly kills and macerates host tissues, and secretes several isozymes of the macerating enzyme pectate lyase (Pel). PelABCE- and Out- (secretion-deficient) mutants were observed to produce a rapid necrosis in tobacco leaves that was indistinguishable from the HR elicited by the narrow-host-range pathogens E. amylovora Ea321 and Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 61. E. amylovora Ea321 hrp genes were used to identify hybridizing cosmids in a cosmid library of E. chrysanthemi EC16 DNA in Escherichia coli. A 16-kb BamHI fragment in one of these cosmids, pCPP2030, hybridized with E. amylovora hrp genes and was mutagenized with Tn10mini-kan. The mutations were introduced into the PelABCE- mutant CUCPB5006 by marker exchange. Two of the resultant hrp::Tn10mini-kan mutations were found to abolish the ability of CUCPB5006 to cause any necrosis in tobacco leaves unless complemented with pCPP2030. These two mutations were also marker-exchanged into the genome of wild-type strain AC4150. Analysis of DNA sequences flanking the hrp-2::Tn10mini-kan insertion revealed the mutated gene to be similar to a gene in E. amylovora Ea321 hrp complementation group VIII and to P. s. pv. syringae 61 hrpX. Neither of the hrp::Tn10mini-kan mutations affected the production or secretion of pectic enzymes by AC4150 or CUCPB5006. However, the hrp mutations reduced the ability of both AC4150 and CUCPB5006 to incite successful infections in witloof chicory leaves.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Characterization of the hrpJ and hrpU operons of Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae Pss61: similarity with components of enteric bacteria involved in flagellar biogenesis and demonstration of their role in HarpinPss secretion.
AB  - The hrp/hrmA gene cluster of Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae Pss61 has been shown to form a minimum genetic unit sufficient to enable nonpathogenic bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, to elicit the hypersensitive response associated with disease resistance. The biochemical functions of most of these genes have not been established. The nucleotide sequence of a 4.3-kb SstI-BglII fragment carrying hrp apparent translational units V, VI, and VII revealed one partial open reading frame (ORF) and five complete ORFs producing 35,126-, 48,866-, 17,308-, 20,482-, and 26,364-Da gene products (hrpJ3, J4, J5, U1, U2, respectively). The production of these proteins was confirmed by using T7 RNA polymerase-directed expression. The partial ORF was found to be identical to the C terminus of HrpJ2. The absence of apparent transcriptional terminators and promoters between hrpI (hrpJ2), hrpJ3, hrpJ4, and hrpJ5 together with the observation that the HrpL-dependent hrpJ promoter directs expression of hrpJ3-J5 indicates that these genes form a single operon controlled by the HrpL-dependent hrpJ promoter. A second HrpL-dependent promoter consensus sequence was also identified upstream of hrpU1 and demonstrated to function as a HrpL-dependent promoter, thus indicating that hrpU1, hrpU2, and additional downstream genes may be part of a second operon. The deduced product of hrpJ3 exhibits similarity to FliG of Salmonella typhimurium, a cytoplasmic protein that regulates flagellar rotation and biogenesis. HrpJ4 shares extensive similarity with the FliI family of ATPase-like proteins and retains the known functional domains conserved among this family of proteins. HrpJ5 has properties similar to the S. typhimurium FliJ. Neither HrpU1 nor HrpU2 exhibit significant similarity to known proteins. Secretion of HarpinPss by E. coli MC4100 transformants carrying pHIR11::TnphoA derivatives was blocked in hrpJ4, J5, and U2 mutants. In view of the previously reported similarity of HrpJ2 to the LcrD super-family that includes FlhA, these results predict that the gene products of the hrpJ and hrpU operons form an inner membrane complex for translocation of proteins similar to that used by the flagellar biogenesis system of S. typhimurium.
TI  - Genetics of galactose metabolism of Erwinia amylovora and its influence on polysaccharide synthesis and virulence of the fire blight pathogen.
AB  - Galactose metabolism mutants of Erwinia amylovora were created by transposon insertions and characterized for their growth properties and interaction with plant tissue. The nucleotide sequence of the galE gene was determined. The gene, which encodes UDP-galactose 4-epimerase, shows homology to the galE genes of Escherichia coli, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Rhizobium meliloti, and other gram-negative bacteria. Cloned DNA with the galE and with the galT and galK genes did not share borders, as judged by the lack of common fragments in hybridization with chromosomal DNA. These genes are thus located separately on the bacterial chromosome. In contrast to the gal operon of E. coli, the galE gene of E. amylovora is constitutively expressed, independently of the presence of galactose in the medium. The function of the galE gene but not of the galT or galK gene is required for bacterial virulence on pear fruits and seedlings. In the absence of galactose, the galE mutant was deficient in amylovoran synthesis. Subsequently, the galE mutant cells elicited host defense reactions, and they were not stained by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled lectin, which efficiently binds to amylovoran capsules of E. amylovora. The mutation affected the side chains of bacterial lipopolysaccharide, but an intact O antigen was not required for virulence. This was shown with another mutant, which could be complemented for virulence but not for side chain synthesis of lipopolysaccharide.
TI  - HrpI of Erwinia amylovora functions in secretion of harpin and is a member of a new protein family.
AB  - HrpI, a 78-kDa protein, functions in the secretion of harpin, a proteinaceous elicitor of the hypersensitive response from Erwinia amylovora. The predicted amino acid sequence of HrpI is remarkably similar to that of LcrD of Yersinia species, the first member of a recently described protein family. Other proteins of the family are MixA from Shigella flexneri, InvA from Salmonella typhimurium, FlhA from Caulobacter crescentus, HrpI from Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, HrpO from Pseudomonas solanacearum, and HrpC2 from Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria. Cells of E. amylovora containing mutated hrpI genes or cells of Escherichia coli containing the cloned hrp gene cluster with mutated hrpI produce but do not export harpin. When similar cells with functional hrpI genes were grown at 25 degrees C, but not at 37 degrees C, harpin was exported to the culture supernatant. Direct evidence that HrpI is involved in the secretion of a virulence protein has been offered. Two other loci of the hrp gene cluster are involved in the regulation of harpin, and four other loci also are involved in the secretion of harpin. Since harpin and other proteins likely to be secreted by the LcrD family of proteins lack typical signal peptides, their secretion mechanism is distinct from the general protein export pathway.
TI  - Penicillin-binding proteins from Erwinia amylovora: mutants lacking PBP2 are avirulent.
AB  - Radiolabelled penicillin G was used to examine penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) from Erwinia amylovora (OT1). This procedure identified seven PBPs with molecular masses ranging from 22 to 83 kDa. E. amylovora PBPs were compared with those from Escherichia coli (JM101) and from two spherical, avirulent TnphoA mutants derived from OT1. Radiolabelled penicillin G bound to only six proteins from the spherical mutants which lacked a 69-kDa PBP. The spherical mutants could be complemented by the cloned E. coli pbpA-rodA operon, which restored both cell shape and virulence to apple seedlings. This suggested that the E. amylovora 69-kDa PBP is probably the functional equivalent of the E. coli PBP2 protein. Southern blot analysis using the E. coli rodA and pbpA genes as radiolabelled probes showed that TnphoA had inserted into the E. amylovora equivalent of the E. coli rodA-pbpA operon. Southern blots to chromosomal DNAs of the two spherical mutants, using the cloned hrp and dsp genes from E. amylovora as radiolabelled probes, confirmed that the TnphoA insertions were not located in the region of the E. amylovora chromosome postulated to encode known virulence factors. Both of the spherical TnphoA mutants synthesized amounts of extracellular polysaccharide equivalent to those synthesized by the wild-type strain (OT1), were resistant to lysis in distilled water and to lysozyme, and elicited the hypersensitive response on nonhost plants. These results indicate a possible role for cell shape in the virulence of this plant pathogen.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence and properties of the hrmA locus associated with the Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 61 hrp gene cluster.
AB  - The hrmA locus, isolated from Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 61, is essential  for phenotypic expression of the P. s. pv. syringae 61 hrp cluster in Escherichia coli strains and enables bacteria carrying the hrp/hrm gene cluster to elicit the hypersensitive response (HR) associated with plant disease resistance. The phenotype of P. s. pv syringae 61 hrmA mutants (pathogenicity+, delayed HR) was distinct from that of hrp mutants. The locus was localized to a 3.6-kb BamH1-EcoR1 fragment whose nucleotide sequence was determined. A single open reading frame was identified that encodes for a 41,457-Da protein of unknown biochemical function. Production of the deduced protein product was confirmed by using T7 RNA polymerase-directed expression of the locus and N-terminal sequence analysis of the isolated HrmA. The deduced protein product did not exhibit homology with any of the characterized avr genes or the hrpN product of Erwinia amylovora. Transcription was shown to initiate 37 nucleotides upstream of the translational start from an apparent sigma 70 promoter. Two hrp genes were shown to act as positive transcriptional factors for hrmA expression. Expression of hrmA in P. syringae pv. glycinea race 4 did not exhibit the phenotypic properties of an avr gene or HrpN, but suggested that this locus may serve a regulatory function. A homolog to hrmA was present in strains of only three of the 23 P. syringae pathovars tested.
TI  - Harpin, elicitor of the hypersensitive response produced by the plant pathogen Erwinia amylovora.
AB  - A proteinaceous elicitor of the plant defense reaction known as the hypersensitive response was isolated from Erwinia amylovora, the bacterium that causes fire blight of pear, apple, and other rosaceous plants. The elicitor, named harpin, is an acidic, heat-stable, cell-envelope-associated protein with an apparent molecular weight of 44 kilodaltons. Harpin caused tobacco leaf lamina to collapse and caused an increase in the pH of bathing solutions of suspension-cultured tobacco cells. The gene encoding harpin (hrpN) was located in the 40-kilobase hrp gene cluster of E. amylovora, sequenced, and mutated with Tn5tac1. The hrpN mutants were not pathogenic to pear, did not elicit the hypersensitive response, and did not produce harpin.
TI  - Site-directed and transposon-mediated mutagenesis with pfd-plasmids by electroporation of Erwinia amylovora and Escherichia coli cells.
AB  - The suicide plasmid pfdA31-Tn5 was constructed to mutagenize Erwinia amylovora and Escherichia coli strains by electorporation. This vector carries the bacteriophage fd replication origin, a beta-lactamase gene and the transposon Tn5. For propagation the plasmid depends on host cells producing fd gene-2 protein. Electroporation of E.amylovora or E.coli cells with plasmid pfdA31-Tn5 yielded more than 10(4) transposition events per micrograms DNA. We have produced and characterized transposon mutants of E.amylovora affecting either galactose metabolism or the synthesis of the phytotoxin (L)-2,5-dihydrophenylalanine. A Tn5-insertion in a gene, involved in exopolysaccharide synthesis of E.amylovora strain Ea7/74, was subcloned into vector pfdA31 and used to mutagenize E.amylovora strain Ea1/79 by site-directed recombination.
TI  - Expression of Erwinia amylovora hrp genes in response to environmental stimuli.
AB  - Seven hrp loci that are essential for the hypersensitive reaction elicited by Erwinia amylovora were transcriptionally fused with a derivative of transposon Tn5, containing the promoterless Escherichia coli beta-glucuronidase reporter gene. The seven hrp fusions were used to monitor expression of the hrp loci in vitro and in planta. No significant expression was detected in rich medium for any of the fusions. However, five of them were expressed highly in planta and in inducing medium that contains mannitol, salts, and 5 mM (NH4)2SO4. Expression of these five hrp loci is regulated by ammonium, nicotinic acid, complex-nitrogen sources, certain carbon sources, temperature, and pH. Under well-defined conditions, i.e., in inducing medium, no specific plant components were required for transcriptional activation of the hrp loci. The high levels of expression detected in vitro were comparable to those determined during the development of the hypersensitive reaction in tobacco. Differential levels of expression of the hrp loci occurred in host and nonhost plants. In pear, a host plant, expression of the hrp loci was delayed and greatly reduced compared with expression in tobacco leaves, a nonhost.
TI  - Biolistic transformation of prokaryotes: factors that affect biolistic transformation of very small cells.
AB  - Five bacterial species were transformed using particle gun-technology. No pretreatment of cells was necessary. Physical conditions (helium pressure, target cell distance and gap distance) and biological conditions (cell growth phase, osmoticum concentration, and cell density) were optimized for biolistic transformation of Escherichia coli and these conditions were then used to successfully transform Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Erwinia amylovora, Erwinia stewartii and Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae. Transformation rates for E. coli were 10(4) per plate per 0.8 micrograms DNA. Although transformation rates for the other species were low (less than 10(2) per plate per 0.8 micrograms DNA), successful transformation without optimization for each species tested suggests wide utility of biolistic transformation of prokaryotes. E. coli has proven to be a useful model system to determine the effects of relative humidity, particle size and particle coating on efficiency of biolistic transformation.
TI  - Structural and functional analysis of the rcsA gene from Erwinia stewartii.
AB  - RcsA is a positive regulator of genes for extracellular polysaccharide biosynthesis in the Enterobacteriaceae. The nucleotide sequence of the rcsA gene from Erwinia stewartii was determined and compared to rcsA sequences from E. amylovora, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Three highly conserved regions of the gene were identified. The C-terminal end of the open reading frame (ORF) shared significant amino acid homology to the LuxR class of bacterial activator proteins. Insertion and deletion mutagenesis of the 5' non-coding region indicated that maximal expression of rcsA was dependent upon cis-acting regulatory sequences located more than 300 bp upstream of the translational start site.
TI  - The rcsA gene from Erwinia amylovora: identification, nucleotide sequence, and regulation of exopolysaccharide biosynthesis.
AB  - RcsA is a positive activator of extracellular polysaccharide synthesis in the Enterobacteriaceae. A cosmid clone containing the rcsA gene from Erwinia amylovora was identified by its ability to restore mucoidy to an E. stewartii rcsA mutant. The rcsA gene was subcloned on a 2.2-kilobase HindIII-PstI fragment that hybridized with an E. stewartii rcsA probe and complemented E. stewartii and Escherichia coli rcsA mutants. In addition, the cloned E. amylovora rcsA gene stimulated expression of cps::lac fusions in E. coli and E. stewartii. The rcsA region was sequenced, and one open reading frame of 211 amino acids was found. The predicted protein sequence specified by this open reading frame was 55% homologous with that of the Klebsiella pneumoniae RcsA protein. Highly conserved regions in the 3' and 5' ends of the two proteins were observed. An E. amylovora rcsA mutant was constructed by Tn5 mutagenesis of the cloned gene followed by recombination of the mutation into the chromosome of wild-type strain Ea1/79. The synthesis of both amylovorin and levan was reduced by more than 90% in this mutant, indicating common regulation of the two polysaccharides by rcsA. Virulence of the rcsA mutant on immature pear fruit was diminished but not completely abolished.
TI  - Molecular cloning, expression and nucleotide sequence of the rcsA gene of Erwinia amylovora, encoding a positive regulator of capsule expression: evidence for a family of related capsule activator proteins.
AB  - A gene encoding a positive activator of the expression of extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) synthesis in the phytopathogen Erwinia amylovora has been isolated from a genomic library in Escherichia coli. The presence of the cloned gene in E. coli stimulated transcription of the genes encoding colanic acid biosynthesis and could complement rcsA mutations. Introduction of the gene on a multicopy plasmid into Er. amylovora caused a threefold increase in EPS expression. The nucleotide sequence of the gene (designated rcsA) was determined. This revealed a single open reading frame encoding an RcsA protein of 23-7 kDa. This was confirmed by minicell analysis in E. coli. The predicted amino acid sequence of this RcsA protein showed a high degree of homology to the RcsA protein of Klebsiella aerogenes, demonstrating the existence of a family of related RcsA activator proteins capable of stimulating EPS expression. The protein had no significant homology to known DNA-binding activator proteins, indicating, for the first time, that the RcsA family of activator proteins may stimulate expression of EPS synthesis indirectly by acting on other regulatory proteins.
TI  - Bacteriophage Mu as a genetic tool to study Erwinia amylovora pathogenicity and hypersensitive reaction on tobacco.
AB  - Erwinia amylovora 1430 was shown to be sensitive to Mu G(-) particles. Infection  resulted either in lytic development or in lysogenic derivatives with insertion of the Mu genome at many sites in the bacterial chromosome. We used the Mu d1Bx::Tn9 (lac Apr Cmr) derivative, called Mu dX, to identify mutants affected in pathogenicity and in their ability to induce a hypersensitive reaction (HR) on tobacco plants. Inoculation of 1,400 lysogenic derivatives on apple root calli led to the identification of 12 mutants in three classes: (i) class 1 mutants were nonpathogenic and unable to induce an HR on tobacco plants; (ii) class 2 mutants were nonpathogenic but retained the ability to induce an HR; and (iii) class 3 mutants showed attenuated virulence. Of the 12 mutants, 8 had a single insertion of the Mu dX prophage. For class 1 and 2 mutants, reversion to pathogenicity was concomitant with the loss of the Mu dX prophage. Furthermore, revertants from the class 1 mutants also recovered the ability to induce an HR on tobacco plants. Five of the six class 3 mutants were impaired in exopolysaccharide production. No changes of the envelope structure (lipopolysaccharide and outer membrane proteins) were correlated with differences in pathogenicity. One class 3 mutant did not produce any functional siderophore, suggesting that iron uptake could be involved in pathogenicity.
TI  - A translational enhancer derived from tobacco mosaic virus is functionally equivalent to a Shine-Dalgarno sequence.
AB  - When present at the 5' end of mRNAs, the untranslated leader sequence (omega) of  tobacco mosaic virus RNA significantly enhances translation in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. We have tested a deletion derivative of the omega sequence, omega delta 3, for its enhancing ability on gene constructs in which the ribosomal binding site was either present or deleted, in several Gram-negative bacterial species including Escherichia coli, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Xanthomonas campestris pv. vitians, Erwinia amylovora, and Salmonella typhimurium. In vivo production of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase from a gene construct lacking its native ribosomal binding site was enhanced 40- to 120-fold by the presence of omega delta 3. Similar levels of enhancement (30- to 240-fold) were observed when the gene encoding beta-glucuronidase was tested. With a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase construct containing a ribosomal binding site, enhancement was markedly less, between 1- and 3.8-fold. Omega delta 3 appeared to enhance translation independent of its position upstream of the AUG codon used for initiation.
TI  - Identification of Erwinia amylovora, the Fireblight Pathogen, by Colony Hybridization with DNA from Plasmid pEA29.
AB  - All strains of Erwinia amylovora characterized carry a medium-size plasmid of 29  kilobases (pEA29). We mapped this plasmid with various restriction enzymes, cloned the whole DNA into an Escherichia coli plasmid, and subcloned restriction fragments. These DNA species were used for identification of E. amylovora after handling of strains in the laboratory and also in field isolates. About 70 strains of E. amylovora and 24 strains from nine other species, mainly found in plant habitats, were checked in a colony hybridization test. Virulent and avirulent E. amylovora strains reacted positively, whereas the other species were negative. Apart from the hybridization assay, the positive strains were additionally tested for ooze production on rich agar with 5% sucrose and on immature-pear slices. Unspecific background hybridization of non-E. amylovora strains found for hybridization with the whole E. amylovora plasmid was almost eliminated when a 5-kilobase SalI fragment from pEA29 was used as a probe and when the washes after the hybridization procedure were done with high stringency. Under these conditions, E. amylovora could be readily identified from field isolates.
TI  - Effect of Increased beta-Glucosidase Activity on Virulence of Erwinia amylovora.
AB  - Plant tissues often contain beta-glucosides that can be enzymatically hydrolyzed  to produce toxic aglycones. It has been suggested that the low beta-glucosidase activity found in Erwinia amylovora contributes to bacterial virulence by allowing the bacteria to infect plants that contain beta-glucosides without inducing the formation of toxic aglycones. To test this suggestion, we created strains of E. amylovora which had high beta-glucosidase activities and studied the ability of these strains to cause fire blight disease in pears (Pyrus communis). We isolated spontaneous mutants that were able to utilize beta-glucosides as the sole carbon source and showed that one class had about 10 times as much beta-glucosidase activity as the wild-type strain. In addition, we constructed several plasmids that carry the Escherichia coli bgl operon under the control of a transposon Tn5 promoter that is expressed in E. amylovora. These plasmids were introduced in E. amylovora by transformation. Pathogenesis studies in immature Bartlett pear fruits, etiolated sprouts, and young shoots showed that a 100-fold increase in beta-glucosidase activity does not interfere with normal development of fire blight disease in these model systems.
TI  - Cloning and Expression in Escherichia coli of the Polysaccharide Depolymerase Associated with Bacteriophage-Infected Erwinia amylovora.
AB  - The bacteriophage-encoded polysaccharide depolymerase produced in Erwinia amylovora has been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The bacteriophage ERA103 genome was observed to consist of five EcoRI fragments, labeled as follows: A, 7.5 kilobases (kb); B, 5.0 kb; C, 2.7 kb; D, 2.1 kb; and E, 1.8 kb. A restriction map for ERA103 was also prepared. Each of the fragments were cloned into the positive-selection vector pOP203(A(2)) and pBR322.
TI  - Bactericidal agents generated by the peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of para-hydroquinones.
AB  - For the three Gram-negative bacteria, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Escherichia coli,  and Erwinia amylovora, p-benzoquinone was the principal bactericidal agent formed in vitro during the oxidation of hydroquinone by horseradish peroxidase, whereas no toxicity could be associated with either phenolic or oxygen-free radicals. Even the continuous generation of p-benzosemiquinone during the simultaneous reduction of p-benzoquinone by xanthine oxidase and reoxidation of hydroquinone by peroxidase was no more toxic than p-benzoquinone alone. Anaerobiosis had no effect on the toxicity of either p-benzoquinone or the peroxidase reaction and the generation of superoxide and hydroxyl radicals catalyzed by xanthine oxidase was not bactericidal. Substitutions on the p-benzoquinone ring decreased quinone toxicity in rough proportion to the decrease in quinone redox potential, suggesting that strong oxidizing potentials are important for such quinone toxicity.
TI  - Evolution of the lipoprotein gene in the enterobacteriaceae. Cloning and DNA sequence of the lpp gene from Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - We cloned the lipoprotein gene from Proteus mirabilis and determined its DNA sequence. Comparison with the lpp genes from Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Erwinia amylovora and Morganella morganii revealed several unique features of the evolution of the lpp gene in the Enterobacteriaceae and enabled us to establish phylogenetic relationships between these bacteria.
TI  - pULB113, an RP4::mini-Mu plasmid, mediates chromosomal mobilization and R-prime formation in Erwinia amylovora, Erwinia chrysanthemi, and subspecies of Erwinia carotovora.
AB  - The RP4::mini-Mu plasmid pULB113, transferred from Escherichia coli strain MXR, was stable and transfer proficient in Erwinia amylovora strain EA303, E. carotovora subsp. atroseptica strain ECA12, E. carotovora subsp. carotovora strain ECC193, and E. chrysanthemi strain EC183. The plasmid mobilized an array of Erwinia sp. chromosomal markers (E. amylovora: his+,ilv+,rbs+,ser+,thr+;E. chrysanthemi:arg+,his+,ilv+,leu+; E. carotovora subsp. atroseptica: arg+,gua+,leu+,lys+,pur+,trp+; E. carotovora subsp. carotovora: arg+,gua+,leu+,lys+,out+[export of enzymes],pur+,trp+), suggesting random interactions of the plasmid with the chromosomes. In E. carotovora subsp. carotovora, pULB113-mediated two-factor crosses revealed linkage between three auxotrophic markers and the out loci. The export of pectate lyase, polygalacturonase, and cellulase and the maceration of potato tuber tissue occurred with Out+, but not Out-, strains of E. carotovora subsp. carotovora, indicating the importance of enzyme export in plant tissue maceration. Erwinia sp. donors harboring pULB113 complemented mutations in various biosynthetic and catabolic genes (arg, gal, his, leu, met, pro, pur, thy) in Escherichia coli recA strains. Escherichia coli transconjugants harbored pULB113 primes as indicated by the cotransfer of Erwinia genes and pULB113 markers and a change in plasmid mass. Moreover, the PstI and SmaI cleavage patterns of selected pULB113 primes were different from those of pULB113. pULB113 primes carried DNA insertions ranging from 3 to about 160 kilobases. These findings indicate that pULB113 is useful for in vivo gene cloning and genetic analysis of various enterobacterial phytopathogens.
TI  - Comparison of the lipoprotein gene among the enterobacteriaceae. DNA sequence of  Morganella morganii lipoprotein gene and its expression in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A DNA sequence of 532 base pairs encompassing the entire Morganella morganii lipoprotein gene (lpp) was determined. Sequence comparisons of the M. morganii lpp gene with the lpp genes from Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, and Erwinia amylovora reveal that the M. morganii lpp gene is more distantly related to the E. coli lpp gene than any of the other lpp genes examined. Between the E. coli and M. morganii lpp genes, the following homologies were found: 44% in the promoter region (bases, -45 to -1), 88% in the 5'-end untranslated region of the mRNA, 58% in the signal sequence coding region, 75% in the coding region for the first 51 and 43% for the last 7 amino acid residues. Upstream of the promoter region and downstream of the termination codon, there are extensive insertions, deletions, and base substitutions. In spite of the differences in the DNA sequences, the lipoprotein structure was found to be highly conserved except for the carboxyl-terminal sequence of 7 amino residues. The coding region of the M. morganii lpp gene including the signal sequence was inserted into an expression cloning vector so that the production of the M. morganii lipoprotein could be induced in E. coli by a lac inducer, isopropyl-beta-D-thioglactoside. It was found that when induced, the M. morganii prolipoprotein was apparently secreted normally across the E. coli cytoplasmic membrane, modified with glycerol and palmitic acid, processed to the mature lipoprotein, and assembled in the E. coli outer membrane. The bound form covalently linked to the peptidoglycan was also found.
TI  - Comparison of the lipoprotein gene among the Enterobacteriaceae. DNA sequence of  Erwinia amylovora lipoprotein gene.
AB  - A DNA sequence of 816 base pairs encompassing the entire Erwinia amylovora lipoprotein gene was determined. Sequence comparison between E. amylovora, Escherichia coli, and Serratia marcescens suggests that the structure of the lipoprotein has been highly conserved under the constraint of efficient gene expression selecting promoter structure, mRNA secondary structure, and codon usage in addition to the polypeptide function. The sequence also suggests that the lpp gene of the three bacteria diverged sequentially in the course of evolution.
TI  - Acceptance by Erwinia spp. of R plasmid R68.45 and its ability to mobilize the chromosome of Erwinia chrysanthemi.
AB  - R plasmid R68.45 was transferred in broth matings from Escherichia coli to strains of Erwinia amylovora, E. carotovora subsp. atroseptica, E. chrysanthemi, and E. herbicola (Enterobacter agglomerans); the frequency of transfer ranged from 2 x 10(-8) to 5 x 10(-4) per input donor cell depending on the bacterial species. The drug resistance markers tet(+), amp(+), and kan(+) were stable in these Erwinia species. Transconjugants of Erwinia spp., but not of the wild-type parent Erwinia strains, acquired levels of antibiotic resistance (tetracycline, 50 mug/ml; ampicillin, 200 mug/ml; kanamycin 200 mug/ml) similar to those of the donor R68.45-bearing strain of Escherichia coli. Erwinia transconjugants (with one exception of E. carotovora subsp. atroseptica) were donors of the antibiotic resistance markers; the frequency of transfer was consistently higher with an E. coli strain than with Erwinia spp. as recipients, and when matings were done on a solid surface (membranes) rather than in liquid. Transfer of chromosomal markers ade(+), gal(+), gtu(+) (utilization of galacturonate), his(+), leu(+), lys(+), thr(+), and trp(+) occurred in crosses between E. chrysanthemi strains harboring R68.45 and appropriate recipient strains; the frequency of transfer ranged from 9.0 x 10(-8) to 2.0 x 10(-6) depending on the selective marker. Analysis of the coinheritance of unselected markers among various classes of recombinants revealed linkage between thr-leu-lys-ade and between trp and his, thus confirming earlier findings with the Hfr-type donor cells. Since R68.45 mobilized an array of chromosomal markers in the wild-type as well as genetically marked strains of E. chrysanthemi, the system, used in conjunction with the existing Hfr strains, should provide a useful tool to study the genetics of plant pathogenicity of this bacterial species. In contrast to E. chrysanthemi, R68.45 did not mobilize chromosomal markers ilv(+), his(+), rbs(+), ser(+), and thr(+) in E. amylovora EA178.
TI  - Homology of the gene coding for outer membrane lipoprotein within various Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The mRNA for a major outer membrane lipoprotein from Escherichia coli was found to hybridize specifically with one of the EcoRI and one of the HindIII restriction endonuclease-generated fragments of total DNA from nine bacteria in the family Enterobacteriaceae: E. coli, Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella typhimurium, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter aerogenes, Edwardsiella tarda, Serratia marcescens, and Erwinia amylovora. However, among the Enterobacteriaceae, DNA from two species of Proteus (P. mirabilis and P. morganii) did not contain any restriction endonuclease fragments that hybridized with the E. coli lipoprotein mRNA. Furthermore, no hybrid bands were detected in four other gram-negative bacteria outside the family Enterobacteriaceae: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter sp. HO1-N, Caulobacter crescentus, and Myxococcus xanthus. Envelope fractions from all bacteria in the family Enterobacteriaceae tested above cross-reacted with antiserum against the purified E. coli free-form lipoprotein in the Ouchterlony immunodiffusion test. Both species of Proteus, however, gave considerably weaker precipitation lines, in comparison with the intense lines produced by the other members of the family. All of the above four bacteria outside the family Enterobacteriaceae did not cross-react with anti-E. coli lipoprotein serum. From these results, the rate of evolutionary changes in the lipoprotein gene seems to be closely related to that observed for various soluble enzymes of the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of Hfr strains of Erwinia amylovora.
AB  - Hfr strains (Hfr 159 and its derivatives, Hfr 160 and Hfr 161) were constructed from Erwinia amylovora ICPB EA178 by introducing an Escherichia coli F'his+ plasmid and then selecting for integration of F'his+ after treatment with acridine orange. The Hfr strains were relatively stable upon repeated transfers on nonselective media. Interrupted mating experiments and analyses of inheritance of unselected markers showed that his+ is transferred by Hfr 159 as the proximal marker at a relatively high frequency (about 5 x 10(-4) recombinants per input donor cell), followed by ilv+, orn+, arg+, pro+, rbs+, met+, trp+, leu+, ser+, and thr+ (not necessarily in that precise order). The donor strains, previously constructed in E. amylovora by integration of F'lac+ from E. coli transfer cys+ as the proximal marker followed by ser+. Further analysis of one of those earlier donor strains, Hfr99, showed that ser+ is followed by arg+, orn+, met+, pro+, leu+, ilv+, rbs+, his+, trp+, and thr+ (not necessarily in that precise order). Thus, the Hfr strains constructed by integration of F'his+ are different, in terms of origin and direction of transfer, from those derived from integration of F'lac+. The applicability of these Hfr strains to mapping the genes on the E. amylovora chromosome is indicated.
TI  - Enzymatic degradation of polygalacturonic acid by Yersinia and Klebsiella species in relation to clinical laboratory procedures.
AB  - As scored by several specified plating procedures, clinical and environmental strains of Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae "Oxytocum" showed detectable, albeit generally weak, ability to digest polygalacturonic (pectic) acid. None of these bacterial strains had the vigorous and rapid pectolytic activity on these polygalacturonic acid-containing media that is typical of soft-rot Erwinia species, although some of the Oxytocum strains came fairly close. Analyses of the pectolytic enzyme contents of the cells and culture supernatants of the Yersinia and Klebsiella species revealed that readily detectable quantities of cell-bound polygalacturonic acid trans-eliminase and hydrolytic polygalacturonase were formed by the Yersinia and Klebsiella species; however, the total units of enzyme activity produced by these bacteria were, in general, lower than were produced by soft-rot Erwinia species. Furthermore, unlike the situation in soft-rot Erwinia cultures, these pectolytic enzymes of Yersinia and Klebsiella species were not excreted rapidly and massively into the growth medium. Cultures of other enterobacteria (Citrobacter species, Enterobacter species, Erwinia amylovora, Erwinia herbicola, Escherichia coli, Proteus species, Salmonella typhimurium, and Serratia marcescens) showed no pectolytic ability whatsoever by any of the plating procedures used and (to the extent they were so examined) produced no pectolytic enzymes detectable either in their cells or culture supernatants. This slow or weak release of pectolytic enzymes by Yersinia and Klebsiella species has a bearing on clinical laboratory procedures suitable for detecting their pectolytic activity; methods adequate for this purpose are detailed.
TI  - Zeatin ribonucleosides in the transfer ribonucleic acid of Rhizobium leguminosarum, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Corynebacterium fascians, and Erwinia amylovora.
AB  - Until recently, the presence in transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) of the hydroxylated cytokinin ribosylzeatin [N6-(4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl)adenosine]was thought to be unique to higher plants. This extension of work from several laboratories indicates the presence of 2-methylthioribosylzeatin in the tRNA of the plant-associated bacteria Rhizobium leguminosarum, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and Corynebacterium fascians, but not in that of Erwinia amylovora. This cytokinin has the cis configuration, as is normally found in the tRNA's of plants. The tRNA thionucleotide patterns in these bacteria are different from those of Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Salmonella typhimurium, which contain the unhydroxylated analogs of ribosylzeatin or 2-methylthioribosylzeatin.
TI  - Transfer of episome F'lac+ and chromosomal trp+ genes from Erwinia amylovora to Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - The F'lac+ episome of Escherichia coli origin was transferred by conjugation with frequencies of 10(-7) to 10(-5) from Erwinia amylovora to 14 out of 15 Salmonella typhimurium trp female parents. The chromosomal trp+ genes were transferred with frequencies of 10(-7) to 10(-6) only to one trpB and 2 trpD female parents, which have a point mutation in the 2nd and fourth structural genes, respectively, of the tryptophan operon. The transferred male trp+ genes became integrated at the selected sites of the S. tryphimurium chromosome. The resulting Trp+ hybrids were phenotypically stable, lacked a cryptic trp allele selected against in the female parent, had high genetic homology values in the tryptophan region, and showed biochemical reactions and pathogenicity typical of S. typhimurium.
TI  - Conjugational transfer of genes determining plant virulence in Erwinia amylovora.
AB  - A stable virulent donor strain (EA 178R1-99) of Erwinia amylovora can transfer, by conjugation during a 3-h mating period, the gene or genes which determine(s) plant virulence to avirulent recipient strains (EA178-M64S1 and EA178-M173S1) of Escherichia amylovora. The virulence of over 200 recombinant clones was tested; they all were as virulent on immature Bartlett pear fruits (and, in the smaller series of strains tested, also, on Pyracantha twigs) as was the parent donor strain. Although the avirulent recipeint strains are amino acid auxotrophs, addition of the required amino acids to the inocula in plant virulence trials does not of itself restore virulence. Two small series of prototrophic revertant clones were selected from the auxotrophic avirulent recipient strains; only nine of the 21 prototrophic revertant clones regained virulence, whereas the other 12 prototrophic revertant clones remained avirulent, again suggesting a lack of parallelism between nutritional status and virulence in this system. Preliminary interrupted mating trials, carried out at 15-min intervals over 3 h, show that ser is transferred during the first 15 min, that pro starts entering at about 75 min (and with a higher frequency later), and that lac (originating from an integrated Escherichia coli F'lac) enters toward the end of the 3-h mating period and at a reduced frequency compared to the other markers. The gene or genes which determine(s) plant virulence in this Escherichia amylovora donor strain appear(s) to be transferred readily and seemingly completely to recipient strains during the first 15 min of a 3-h mating period. Exposure of the virulent donor strain to acridine orange or ethidium bromide does not result in loss of virulence, suggesting (but, of course, not proving conclusively) that the determinant(s) of virulence in Escherichia amylovora might be chromosomal rather than extrachromosomal.
TI  - Gene transmission among strains of Erwinia amylovora.
AB  - Stable donor strains of Erwinia amylovora were obtained from strain EA178R(1) (harboring an Escherichia coli F'lac) by selection for clones resistant to curing by acridine orange. These donor strains (EA178R(1)-99 and EA178R(1)-111) transfer chromosomal markers (arg, cys, gua, ilv, met, pro, ser, trp); the frequency of the appearance of recombinants prototrophic for Cys, Gua, Met, Ser, and Trp is highest (> 10(-5)), followed by recombinants prototrophic for Arg, Ilv, and Pro (10(-7) to 10(-5)). The results of interrupted matings, as well as the frequency of transmission of various markers, suggest that cys is transferred as an early marker by both donor strains. The Hfr state of these donor strains is rather likely on the basis of the following observations. The donor strains exhibit a relatively efficient and possibly oriented chromosome transfer; the Lac(+) character is not cured by acridine orange in these donor strains; and these donor strains do not transfer F.
TI  - Transmission of lac by the sex factor E in Erwinia strains from human clinical sources.
AB  - Lactose-utilizing (Lac(+)) strains of Erwinia spp. from human clinical material transfer lac by conjugation to plant strains of Erwinia herbicola and Erwinia amylovora, to other Erwinia strains from human clinical sources, and also to Escherichia coli, Paracolobactrum arizonae, Salmonella typhimurium, and Shigella dysenteriae. The frequency of this transfer varies with the donor and recipient strains employed. The lac genes appear stable in these exconjugants, and they are not cured by acridine orange. The Lac(+) exconjugants transfer lac to an Escherichia coli F(-) Lac(-) strain; the frequency of this transfer is high with E. herbicola and S. typhimurium exconjugants and relatively low with other exconjugants. The most studied Erwinia donor strain from human clinical material (EH133) and its Lac(+) exconjugants are insensitive to the F-specific phage, M13. P1-mediated transduction of lac, by using a Lac(+) exconjugant of E. coli as the donor and an E. coli F(-) Lac(-) strain as the recipient, revealed that all 50 Lac(+) transduced clones tested also inherited donor ability, suggesting a close linkage between the Erwinia sex factor (designated as E) and the lac genes. The E. coli culture harboring E-lac (E and the lac genes linked to it) does not restrict phages T1, T7, and lambdavir. E-lac is compatible with F'his, R100 drd-56 (F-like), and R64 drd-11 (I-like); cells harboring F'his or one of the R factors do not show super-infection immunity to the incoming E-lac, and E-lac plus one of the other plasmids can coexist stably in the same cell. The fertility of cells harboring F'his or R100 drd-56-as determined by the frequency of conjugal transfer of his or of the resistance determinant (Tet(r) in case of R100 drd-56) and also by sensitivity to F-specific phage (M13)-is not altered by the presence of E-lac, and this suggests that the sex factor E might belong to the fi(-) class.
TI  - Ultrastructure of the cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane of gram-negative bacteria with different fixation techniques.
AB  - The ultrastructure of the cytoplasmic membrane and cell wall of two strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus morganii, P. vulgaris, Acinetobacter anitratum, Moraxella lacunata, Erwinia amylovora, Acinetobacter sp., and of a plant pathogen, unclassified gram-negative, fixed by the Ryter-Kellenberger procedure, was found to be significantly affected by the use or omission of the uranyl postfixation included in that procedure, and by the presence or absence of calcium in the OsO(4) fixative. The omission of the uranyl treatment results in a less clear profile of both the outer membrane of the cell wall and of the cytoplasmic membrane. The observation of these two membranes is further limited when both uranyl and calcium are omitted. The R-layer and the material covering the surface of the cell wall appear more distinct when the uranyl postfixation is not used. Evidence is given suggesting that the influence of uranyl and calcium ions on the appearance of the outer and cytoplasmic membranes would be primarily due to their action as fixatives, whereas the influence of uranyl on the appearance of the R-layer would be due to a direct action on the peptidoglycan component of this layer. When uranyl acetate is used as a section stain after the embedding in plastic, it improves the observation of the R-layer. In this case, a well contrasted R-layer is consistently observed in all strains studied, provided that the postfixation has been omitted. The frequent difficulty in clearly observing the R-layer in many published micrographs probably results from the common use of uranyl postfixation.
TI  - Transfer among Erwinia spp. and other enterobacteria of antibiotic resistance carried on R factors.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance carried on R factors was transferred by conjugation from Escherichia coli B/r and Shigella flexneri 1a to Erwinia spp. Tetracycline resistance (TetR) carried on R factor R100 drd-56 was transferred from E. coli B/r to strains of Erwinia amylovora, E. aroideae, E. atroseptica, E. chrysanthemi, E. cytolytica, E. dissolvens, E. herbicola, E. nigrifluens, and E. nimipressuralis, but not to strains of Erwinia carotovora, E. carnegieana, E. dieffenbachiae, E. oleraceae, and E. quercina. Multiple antibiotic resistance (chloramphenicol, streptomycin, tetracycline; ChlR-StrR-TetR) carried on R factor SR1 was transferred from a clinical isolate of S. flexneri 1a to strains of E. aroideae, E. chrysanthemi, E. herbicola, and E. nigrifluens, but not to strains of other Erwinia spp. The frequency of this transfer was low with receptive cultures of Erwinia spp. and E. coli (F(-) strain). Antibiotic resistance in the exconjugants showed varying degrees of stability in the presence or absence of acridine orange, depending on the strain tested. The frequencies of segregation to drug susceptibility in the presence of acridine orange, though low, suggest that the elements exist as plasmids in the majority of the Erwinia exconjugants. Multiple antibiotic resistance (ChlR-StrR-TetR) was found to segregate into various resistance classes (ChlR-StrR, StrR-TetR, TetR, StrR, and none) in these exconjugants. The exconjugants of E. amylovora, E. herbicola, and E. nigrifluens, to which R100 drd-56 was transferred from E. coli B/r, were sensitive to the male (F)-specific phage M13. There was a positive correlation between the susceptibility of exconjugants to the F-specific phage M13 and their ability to transfer R100 drd-56 to the recipient cultures of Escherichia coli, Erwinia herbicola, Salmonella typhimurium, and Shigella dysenteriae. Exceptions were, however, noted with Erwinia dissolvens and E. nimipressuralis exconjugants harboring R100 drd-56; these exconjugants, although not susceptible to M13, transferred R100 drd-56 to the recipient cultures. The frequency of transfer of R100 drd-56 and the levels of resistance to tetracycline in Erwinia exconjugants were found to differ markedly depending upon the strain employed. Transfer of multiple antibiotic resistance (ChlR-StrR-TetR) from Erwinia exconjugants was not obtained in preliminary trials with an E. coli F(-) strain as the recipient culture.
TI  - Genetic transfer of episomic elements among Erwinia species and other enterobacteria: F'Lac+.
AB  - The episomic element F'lac(+) was transferred, probably by conjugation, from Escherichia coli to Lac(-) strains of Erwinia herbicola, Erwinia amylovora, and Erwinia chrysanthemi (but not to several other Erwinia spp. In preliminary trials). The lac genes in the exconjugants of the Erwinia spp. showed varying degrees of stability depending on the strain (stable in E. herbicola strains Y46 and Y74 and E. amylovora strain EA178, but markedly unstable in E. chrysanthemi strain EC16). The lac genes and the sex factor (F) were eliminated from the exconjugants by treatment with acridine orange, thus suggesting that both lac and F are not integrated in the Erwinia exconjugants. All of the tested Lac(+) exconjugants of E. herbicola strains Y46 and Y74 and E. amylovora strain EA178, but not of E. chrysanthemi strain EC 16, were sensitive to the F-specific phage M13. The heterogenotes (which harbored F'lac(+)) of E. herbicola strains Y46 and Y74, E. amylovora strain EA178, and E. chrysanthemi strain EC16 were able to transfer lac genes by conjugation to strains of E. herbicola, E. amylovora, E. chrysanthemi, Escherichia coli, and Shigella dysenteriae. The frequency of such transfer from Lac(+) exconjugants of Erwinia spp. was comparable to that achieved by using E. coli F'lac(+) as donors, thus indicating the stability, expression, and restriction-and-modification properties of the sex factor (F) in Erwinia spp.
