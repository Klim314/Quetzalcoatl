TI  == salivary microbiota associated with immunoglobulin a nephropathy.
AB  == this study aimed at investigating the salivary microbiota of 28 patients affected by immunoglobulin a nephropathy (igan). fourteen healthy volunteers (hc) were used as control. compared to hc, the number of some cultivable bacteria groups (e.g., total anaerobes) significantly (p < 0.05) decreased in the salivary samples of igan patients. total bacteria from salivary samples of igan patients and hc subjects were analyzed by pyrosequencing of 16s rrna gene. paired t test showed no significant (p > 0.05) differences of alpha-diversity parameters (otu,  ace, chao1, and shannon index) between the salivary samples of hc and igan patients. the difference for the community structure was further analyzed using three phylogeny-based beta-diversity measures. compared to hc, the ratio between  firmicutes/proteobacteria markedly decreased in igan patients. gemella haemolysins, granulicatella adiacens, and veillonella parvula were positively associated (p < 0.05) with hc. within the phylum bacteroidetes, prevotella species (prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, prevotella pallens, and prevotella salivae) were the highest in hc. the only exception was for prevotella aurantiaca. compared to hc, the percentage of abundance of some species, belonging to pasteurellaceae family (e.g., haemophylus parainfluenzae), increased in igan patients. fusobacteriaceae (fusobacterium) and corynebacterium sp. also differed between the salivary samples of hc and igan patients.

TI  == prevotella aurantiaca sp. nov., isolated from the human oral cavity.
AB  == two anaerobic, pigmented, non-spore-forming, gram-stain-negative, rod-shaped strains isolated from the human oral cavity, oma31(t) and oma130, were characterized by determining their phenotypic and biochemical features, cellular  fatty acid profiles and phylogenetic positions based on 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis showed that the new isolates belonged to a single species of the genus prevotella. the two isolates showed 100 % 16s rrna gene sequence similarity with each other and were most closely related to prevotella intermedia atcc 25611(t) with 96.4 % 16s rrna gene sequence similarity; the next most closely related strains to the isolates were prevotella pallens ahn 10371(t) (96.1 %) and prevotella falsenii jcm 15124(t) (95.3 %). phenotypic and biochemical characteristics of the isolates were the same as those of p. intermedia jcm 12248(t), p. falsenii jcm 15124(t) and prevotella nigrescens jcm 12250(t). the isolates could be differentiated from p. pallens jcm 11140( t)  by mannose fermentation and alpha-fucosidase activity. conventional biochemical tests were unable to differentiate the new isolates from p. intermedia, p. falsenii and p. nigrescens. however, hsp60 gene sequence analysis suggested that  strain oma31(t) was not a representative of p. intermedia, p. pallens, p. falsenii or p. nigrescens. based on these data, a novel species of the genus prevotella, prevotella aurantiaca sp. nov., is proposed, with oma31(t) (=jcm 15754(t)=ccug 57723(t)) as the type strain.

TI  == prevotella falsenii sp. nov., a prevotella intermedia-like organism isolated from monkey dental plaque.
AB  == eight anaerobic, pigmented, non-spore-forming, gram-negative, rod-shaped strains  isolated from monkey oral cavities were characterized phenotypically and chemotaxonomically and their phylogenetic positions were determined using 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. the 16s rrna gene sequence analysis showed that these isolates represent a single species of the genus prevotella. these strains  were most closely related to prevotella intermedia atcc 25611(t), with 95.0 % 16s rrna gene sequence similarity. the next most closely related species were prevotella pallens and prevotella nigrescens (92.7 and 92.1 % similarity to the respective type strains). the phenotypic and biochemical characteristics of the isolates were the same as those of p. intermedia jcm 12248(t) and p. nigrescens jcm 12250(t). the isolates could be differentiated from p. pallens jcm 11140(t) on the basis of mannose fermentation and alpha-fucosidase activity. the isolates  could not be distinguished from p. intermedia or p. nigrescens using conventional biochemical tests. dna-dna hybridization experiments revealed the genomic distinctiveness of these eight strains with respect to p. pallens jcm 11140(t), p. intermedia jcm 12248(t) and p. nigrescens jcm 12250(t). on the basis of these  data, strains 04013, 04021, 04043, 04052(t), 0406, 04113, 04111 and 04161 represent a novel prevotella species, for which the name prevotella falsenii sp.  nov. is proposed. the type strain is 04052(t) (=jcm 15124(t) =ccug 56137(t)).

TI  == an examination of 'unidentified' prevotella (formerly pinlo) using rapd-pcr and partial 16s rrna gene sequencing.
AB  == prevotella intermedia- and prevotella nigrescens-like organisms (pinlo) have been described as organisms which are phenotypically and biochemically similar to p. intermedia and p. nigrescens and the species p. pallens was created to include some of them. other pinlo groups which do not fit the definition of p. pallens exist, and in this study these 'unidentified' prevotella sp. were compared with p. corporis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens and p. pallens using commercial identification kits, glc, rapd-pcr and partial 16s rrna gene sequencing. the rapid id 32 a and the rapid ana ii system both identified all 'unidentified' prevotella as p. intermedia. similarly they gave this identification to all the species tested (with the exception of p. corporis using the rapid ana ii system)  clearly demonstrating biochemical similarities. gas liquid chromatography (glc) analysis of the volatile end-products of fermentation could not distinguish between strains. rapd-pcr using arbitrary primer l10 demonstrated intra-species homogeneity within pinlo strains with amplification profiles which differed from  other prevotella species tested. cluster analysis of the amplification profiles confirmed species divisions and yielded a distinct 'unidentified' prevotella cluster. comparison of partial 16s rdna sequences displayed 98% sequence similarity between the 'unidentified' prevotella strains, although 2 strains, hst 1156 and hst 2160 displayed 100% identity. the highest similarity between groups  was seen between 'unidentified' prevotella strains and p. corporis (approximately 94% similarity). the dna techniques used here confirm that 'unidentified' prevotella strains are distinct from the other species of prevotella tested, including p. pallens. partial 16s rdna sequence comparisons suggested a close relationship with p. corporis.

TI  == phylogenetic characterization and proposal of a new pigmented species to the genus prevotella: prevotella pallens sp. nov.
AB  == complete 16s rrna gene sequences of three representative strains of anaerobic, gram-negative, pigmented, moderately saccharolytic, indole-positive bacteria isolated from the oral cavity of humans were determined. according to comparative analyses of the rrna sequence data, this organism represents a previously unknown species within the genus prevotella. in addition, 22 representative strains and 21 reference strains (including 11 prevotella intermedia and 10 prevotella nigrescens strains) were subjected to multilocus enzyme electrophoretic analysis. the strains were consistently separated into three clearly distinct groups, corresponding to their previous entities. on the basis of the present phylogenetic results that confirmed our biochemical and genetic data, we propose  a new species, prevotella pallens. the type strain is nctc 13042 (= ahn 10371).
