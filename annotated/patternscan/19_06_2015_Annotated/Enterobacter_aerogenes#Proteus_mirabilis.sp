TI  == in vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the canward surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 canadian hospitals from january 2010 to december 2012. in total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution method (document m07-a9, 2012), with mics interpreted by using clsi breakpoints (document m100-s23, 2013). ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (mic90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca,  proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii, and haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, c. freundii, and h. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to clsi mic interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (p. mirabilis) to 54.0% (s. marcescens). all isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates (mic90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity  against staphylococci or streptococci. all isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 0.03 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and streptococcus agalactiae (mic90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. we conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of enterobacteriaceae resistant to  third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)- and ampc-producing e. coli and esbl-producing k. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of schinus lentiscifolius (anacardiaceae).
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: schinus lentiscifolius marchand (syn. schinus weinmannifolius engl) is a plant native to rio grande do sul (southern brazil) and has been used in brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. material and methods: the crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five gram positive bacteria: bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, three gram negative bacteria: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: candida albicans, candida tropicalis, cryptococcus neoformans, and saccharomyces cerevisiae. the isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two gram positive bacteria, namely, bacillus cereus, enterococcus spp, and six gram negative bacteria, namely, burkholderia cepacia, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and proteus mirabilis. results: the leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of schinus lentiscifolius showed a  broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (mic) against the tested bacteria and fungi. the n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against candida albicans (mic=25 mug/ml), candida tropicalis (mic=15.5 mug/ml), and cryptococcus neoformans, (mic=15.5 mug/ml). from the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of schinus lentiscifolius. conclusion: the antimicrobial activity and some constituents of schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. the results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.

TI  == etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of bacterial pathogens from urinary tract infection.
AB  == urinary tract infection (uti) is the most common infection in both community and  hospital patients. in majority of the cases, empirical antimicrobial treatment is practiced before the laboratory results of urine culture. thus, antibiotic resistance may increase in urinary bacterial pathogens due to improper use of drugs. this study was designed to find out the etiological agents of uti and their prevalence, and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of the bacterial pathogens isolated from urine culture. this study was conducted in  kathmandu model hospital, kathmandu, nepal from april to october, 2009. midstream urine samples from 1323 patients suspected of uti were analyzed by microscopy, and conventional semi-quantitative culture technique for the significant growth.  antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed for the isolates by modified kirby-bauer disk diffusion method. data were analyzed using spss software window  version 16. the overall prevalence of uti was found to be 18.89%. the most frequent causative organisms isolated were escherichia coli (82.30%), enterococcus faecalis (5.60%), citrobacter freundii (3.60%), enterobacter aerogenes (2.40%), coagulase negative staphylococci (2.40%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.20%), proteus mirabilis (0.8%), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.4%), and staphylococcus aureus (0.4%). nitrofurantoin and amoxycillin were found to be the most effective antibiotic against gram negative and gram positive isolates respectively. e. coli was found to be the most common etiological agent of uti and nitrofurantoin was the most effective drug among the isolates.

TI  == antibacterial activity of statins: a comparative study of atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin.
AB  == background: statins have several effects beyond their well-known antihyperlipidemic activity, which include immunomodulatory, antioxidative and anticoagulant effects. in this study, we have tested the possible antimicrobial activity of statins against a range of standard bacterial strains and bacterial clinical isolates. methods: minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) values were evaluated and compared among three members of the statins drug (atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin). results: it was revealed that statins are able to induce variable degrees of antibacterial activity with atorvastatin, and simvastatin being the more potent than rosuvastatin. methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (vse), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre), acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus epidermidis, and enterobacter aerogenes, were more sensitive to both atorvastatin, and simvastatin compared to  rosuvastatin. on the other hand, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter cloacae were more sensitive to atorvastatin compared to both simvastatin and rosuvastatin. furthermore, most clinical isolates were less sensitive to statins compared to their corresponding standard strains. conclusion: our findings might raise the possibility of a potentially important antibacterial class effect for statins especially, atorvastatin and simvastatin.

TI  == identification of bacteria isolated from nasal polyps and their ability to produce superantigens and biofilms in lebanese patients.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus superantigens and bacterial biofilms have been implicated in the development of chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps. we conducted a study of 32 lebanese patients-21 males and 11 females, aged 15 to 71 years (mean: 39)-to identify bacteria isolated from nasal polyps and to determine if these bacteria produced superantigens and biofilms. polyps were surgically removed, homogenized, and subjected to bacteriologic studies. the presence or absence of s aureus enterotoxin a, b, c, and d (superantigen) genes was determined in all isolates by polymerase chain reaction. biofilm production by coagulase-negative staphylococci and pseudomonas aeruginosa was assessed by tissue culture plate assay. a total of 34 bacterial species/groups were isolated from the nasal polyps. of these, only 3 (8.8%) were s aureus, and only 1 possessed an enterotoxin-coding gene (enterotoxin b). moreover, of the 21 coagulase-negative staphylococci isolates that were found, none possessed the investigated genes, and only 1 had a strong biofilm-formation property. our results could not confirm that s aureus enterotoxins (superantigens) or biofilm-producing bacteria play a role in the development of nasal polyps in the lebanese group studied.

TI  == escherichia, klebsiella, enterobacter, serratia, citrobacter, and proteus
AB  == the gram-negative bacilli of the genera escherichia, klebsiella, enterobacter, serratia, citrobacter,and proteus(table 26- 1) are members of the normal intestinal flora of humans and animals and may be isolated from a variety of environmental sources. with the exception of proteus, they are sometimes collectively referred to as the coliform bacilli because of shared properties, particularly the ability of most species to ferment the sugar lactose. many of these microorganisms used to be dismissed as harmless commensals. today, they are known to be responsible for major health problems worldwide. a limited number of  species, including e coli, k pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, s marcescens,and p mirabilis, are responsible for most infections produced by this group of organisms. the increasing incidence of the coliforms, proteus, and other gram-negative organisms in diseases reflects in part a better  understanding of their pathogenic potential but more importantly the changing ecology of bacterial disease. the widespread and often indiscriminate use of antibiotics has created drug-resistant gram-negative bacilli that readily acquire multiple resistance through transmission of drug resistance plasmids (r factors). also, development of new surgical procedures, health support technology, and therapeutic regimens has provided new portals of entry and compromised many host  defenses.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftobiprole against frequently encountered aerobic and facultative gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens: results of the canward 2007-2009 study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ceftobiprole was evaluated against 15 011 clinical isolates obtained from patients in canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. all  staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ceftobiprole (mic(90)'s for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus of </= 1 mug/ml and 2 mug/ml, respectively). ceftobiprole was active against penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90), </=  0.06 mug/ml), penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90), 0.5 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic(90), </= 0.06 mug/ml), staphylococcus epidermidis (mic(90), </= 1 mug/ml), and enterococcus faecalis (mic(90), </= 1 mug/ml). over 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, and serratia marcescens isolates were inhibited by a ceftobiprole concentration of </= 1 mug/ml. ceftobiprole was not active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and k. pneumoniae. the in vitro activity of ceftobiprole versus  pseudomonas aeruginosa was similar to that of cefepime (mic(90), 16 mug/ml). the  broad spectrum of activity by ceftobiprole would support further study of this agent in the treatment of hospital-acquired infections.

TI  == identification and characterization of a phospholipase a2 from the venom of the saw-scaled viper: novel bactericidal and membrane damaging activities.
AB  == phospholipase a(2) (pla(2)), a common toxic component of snake venom, has been implicated in various pharmacological effects. in this study, a basic myotoxic pla(2), named ectx-i was isolated from echis carinatus snake venom by using gel filtration on superdex g-75, and reverse phase hplc on c18 and c8 sepharose columns. pla(2), ectx-i was 13,861.72 molecular weight as estimated by maldi-tof  (15 kd by sds-page), and consisted of 121 amino acid residues cross-linked by seven disulfide bonds. the n-terminal sequences revealed significant homology with basic myotoxic pla(2)s from other snake venoms. the purified pla(2) ectx-i was evaluated (250 mug/ml) for bactericidal activity of a wide variety of human pathogens against burkholderia pseudomallei (khw&tes), enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. ectx-i showed strong antibacterial activity against b. pseudomallei (khw) and e. aerogenes among the tested bacteria. other gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria showed only a moderate effect. however,  the gram-positive bacterium e. aerogenes failed to show any effect on ectx-i protein at tested doses. the most significant bacteriostatic and bactericidal effect of ectx-i was observed at mics of >15 mug/ml against (b. pseudomallei, khw) and mics >30 mug/ml against e. aerogenes. mechanisms of bactericidal and membrane damaging effects were proved by ultra-structural analysis. ectx-i was able to induce cytotoxicity on thp-1 cells in vitro as well as lethality in balb/c mice. ectx-i also induced mild myotoxic effects on mouse skin, but was devoid of hemolytic effects on human erythrocytes up to 500 mug/ml. it is shown that the toxic effect induced by e. carinatus venom is due to the presence of myotoxic pla(2) (ectx-i). the result also corroborates the hypothesis of an association between toxic and enzymatic domains. in conclusion, ectx-i displays a heparin binding c-terminal region, which is probably responsible for the cytotoxic and bactericidal effects.

AB  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producers in the family enterobacteriaceae are recognized worldwide as nosocomial pathogens, however it is difficult to screen them in the routine laboratory processing. chromid esbl agar newly developed for screening esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae was released in japan in april, 2007. we evaluated the clinical assessment of chromid esbl agar in routine microbiology laboratory. the 47 strains investigated were clinical isolates belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae with the mics of cefpodoxime greater than 2 mug/ml. the 27 esbl-producers examined were comprising of 19 escherichia coli, 3 klebsiella oxytoca, 1 citrobacter freundii, 3 enterobacter cloacae, and 1 s. marcescens (esbl group) and 20 esbl non-producers  consiating of 5 k. oxytoca, 1 proteus mirabilis, 1 p. vlugaris, 2 serratia marcescens, 8 c. freundii, 2 enterobacter cloacae, and 1 e. aerogenes (non-esbl group). characterization of beta-lactamase genes was carried out by use of polymerase chain reaction. as the results, the sensitivity and the specificity of chromid esbl agar plates after incubation for 18 hours was 100% and 20%, respectively. it should be noted that the values of specificity was extremely low compared with those of the sensitivity. these findings clearly suggested that in  cases of utilizing chromid esbl agar plates, it should be important to consider its characteristic properties, as even the esbl-non-producers could grow on these media only when they were resistant to cpdx.

TI  == [investigation of antibacterial activity of sertralin].
AB  == sertralin is a psychotropic drug which acts by inhibiting the selective serotonin re-uptake in the synaptic area. previous studies have shown that some antidepressant agents have antibacterial activity. the aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of sertralin. a total of 224 bacterial strains isolated from clinical specimens together with standard control strains were included to the study. the antibacterial activity of sertralin was determined by microdilution method in mueller-hinton broth according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) guideline. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values were found to be 4-32 microg/ml for 22 methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 25 methicillin-resistant s. aureus strains, 8-32 microg/ml for 20 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 4 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis strains, 0.5-32 microg/ml for  10 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium strains, 2-8 microg/ml for 12 vancomycin-resistant e. faecium strains, 16-128 microg/ml for 21 acinetobacter baumannii strains, 4->128 microg/ml for 20 klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 0.25-128 microg/ml for 24 escherichia coil strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 22 pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 128->128 microg/ml for 2 proteus vulgaris strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 8 proteus mirabilis strains, 32->128 microg/ml for 7 stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains, 32-128 microg/ml for 21 enterobacter cloacae strains and 8-128 microg/ml for 6 enterobacter aerogenes strains. the mic values of sertralin against standard strains were as follows; 16 microg/ml for s. aureus atcc 29213 (methicillin-susceptible), 32 microg/ml for s. aureus atcc 43300 (methicillin-resistant), 16 microg/ml for e. faecalis atcc 29212, 32 microg/ml for k. pneumoniae atcc 700603, 32 microg/ml for e. coli atcc 25922 and  > 128 microg/ml for p. aeruginosa atcc 27853. sertralin has showed antibacterial  activity mainly against gram-positive bacteria, and it was surprising that mic values of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were lower than those of vancomycin-susceptible ones. further in vivo and in vitro studies are required to provide reliable data about the use of sertralin as an adjuvant agent in the antibacterial treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.

TI  == international spread and persistence of tem-24 is caused by the confluence of highly penetrating enterobacteriaceae clones and an inca/c2 plasmid containing tn1696::tn1 and is5075-tn21.
AB  == tem-24 remains one of the most widespread tem-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) among enterobacteriaceae. to analyze the reasons influencing its spread and persistence, a multilevel population genetics study was carried out on 28 representative tem-24 producers from belgium, france, portugal, and spain (13 enterobacter aerogenes isolates, 6 escherichia coli isolates, 6 klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, 2 proteus mirabilis isolates, and 1 klebsiella oxytoca isolate, from 1998 to 2004). clonal relatedness (xbai pulsed-field gel electrophoresis [pfge] and e. coli phylogroups) and antibiotic susceptibility were determined by standard procedures. plasmid analysis included  determination of the incompatibility group (by pcr, hybridization, and/or sequencing) and comparison of restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) patterns. characterization of genetic elements conferring antibiotic resistance included integrons (classes 1, 2, and 3) and transposons (tn3, tn21, and tn402).  similar pfge patterns were identified among e. aerogenes, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis isolates, while e. coli strains were diverse (phylogenetic groups a, b2, and d). highly related 180-kb inca/c2 plasmids conferring resistance to kanamycin, tobramycin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim, and sulfonamides were identified. each plasmid contained defective in0-tn402 (dfra1-aada1, aaca4, or aaca4-aacc1-orfe-aada2-cmla1) and in4-tn402 (aaca4 or dfra1-aada1) variants. these integrons were located within tn21, tn1696, or hybrids of these transposons, with is5075 interrupting their irtnp and irmer. in all cases, blatem-24 was part of an is5075-deltatn1 transposon within tnp1696, mimicking other genetic elements containing blatem-2 and blatem-3 variants. the international dissemination of tem-24 is fuelled by an inca/c2 plasmid acquired by different enterobacterial clones which seem to evolve by gaining diverse genetic elements. this work highlights the risks of a confluence between highly penetrating clones and highly promiscuous plasmids in the spread of antibiotic resistance, and it contributes to the elucidation of the origin and evolution of  tem-2 esbl derivatives.

TI  == ampc beta-lactamases.
AB  == summary: ampc beta-lactamases are clinically important cephalosporinases encoded  on the chromosomes of many of the enterobacteriaceae and a few other organisms, where they mediate resistance to cephalothin, cefazolin, cefoxitin, most penicillins, and beta-lactamase inhibitor-beta-lactam combinations. in many bacteria, ampc enzymes are inducible and can be expressed at high levels by mutation. overexpression confers resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins including cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone and is a problem especially in infections due to enterobacter aerogenes and enterobacter cloacae, where an isolate initially susceptible to these agents may become resistant upon therapy.  transmissible plasmids have acquired genes for ampc enzymes, which consequently can now appear in bacteria lacking or poorly expressing a chromosomal bla(ampc) gene, such as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis. resistance due to plasmid-mediated ampc enzymes is less common than extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production in most parts of the world but may be both harder to detect and broader in spectrum. ampc enzymes encoded by both chromosomal and plasmid genes are also evolving to hydrolyze broad-spectrum cephalosporins more efficiently. techniques to identify ampc beta-lactamase-producing isolates are available but are still evolving and are not yet optimized for the clinical laboratory, which probably now underestimates  this resistance mechanism. carbapenems can usually be used to treat infections due to ampc-producing bacteria, but carbapenem resistance can arise in some organisms by mutations that reduce influx (outer membrane porin loss) or enhance  efflux (efflux pump activation).

TI  == viper metalloproteinase (agkistrodon halys pallas) with antimicrobial activity against multi-drug resistant human pathogens.
AB  == metalloproteinases are abundant enzymes in crotalidae and viperidae snake venoms. snake venom metalloproteinases (svmps) comprise a family of zinc-dependent enzymes, which display many different biological activities. a 23.1 kda protein was isolated from agkistrodon halys (pallas, chinese viper) snake venom. the toxin is a single chain polypeptide with a molecular weight of 23146.61 and an n-terminal sequence (miqvllvticlavfpyqgssiiles) relatively similar to that of other metalloprotein-like proteases isolated from the snake venoms of the viperidae family. the antibacterial effect of agkistrodon halys metalloproteinase (ahm) on burkholderia pseudomallei (strains tes and khw), escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa (gram-negative bacteria) and staphylococcus aureus (gram-positive bacterium) was studied at a concentration 120 microm. interestingly, we found that the metalloproteinase exhibited antibacterial properties and was more active against s. aureus, p. vulgaris, p. mirabilis and multi-drug resistant b. pseudomallei (strain khw) bacteria. ahm variants with high bacteriostatic activity (mic 1.875-60 microm) also tended to be less cytotoxic against u-937 human monocytic cells up to 1 mm concentrations. these results suggest that this  metalloprotein exerts its antimicrobial effect by altering membrane packing and inhibiting mechanosensitive targets.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance among gram-negative bacilli causing infections in intensive care unit patients in the united states between 1993 and 2004.
AB  == during the 12-year period from 1993 to 2004, antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of 74,394 gram-negative bacillus isolates recovered from intensive care  unit (icu) patients in united states hospitals were determined by participating hospitals and collected in a central location. mics for 12 different agents were  determined using a standardized broth microdilution method. the 11 organisms most frequently isolated were pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.2%), escherichia coli (18.8%), klebsiella pneumoniae (14.2%), enterobacter cloacae (9.1%), acinetobacter spp. (6.2%), serratia marcescens (5.5%), enterobacter aerogenes (4.4%), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4.3%), proteus mirabilis (4.0%), klebsiella oxytoca (2.7%), and citrobacter freundii (2.0%). specimen sources included the lower respiratory tract (52.1%), urine (17.3%), and blood (14.2%). rates of resistance to many of the antibiotics tested remained stable during the 12-year study period. carbapenems were the most active drugs tested against most of the bacterial species. e. coli and p. mirabilis remained susceptible to most of the drugs tested. mean rates of resistance to 9 of the 12 drugs tested increased with acinetobacter spp. rates of resistance to ciprofloxacin increased over the study  period for most species. ceftazidime was the only agent to which a number of species (acinetobacter spp., c. freundii, e. aerogenes, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, and s. marcescens) became more susceptible. the prevalence of multidrug resistance, defined as resistance to at least one extended-spectrum cephalosporin, one aminoglycoside, and ciprofloxacin, increased substantially among icu isolates of acinetobacter spp., p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and e. cloacae.

TI  == antibacterial activity of snake, scorpion and bee venoms: a comparison with purified venom phospholipase a2 enzymes.
AB  == aims: venoms of snakes, scorpions, bees and purified venom phospholipase a(2) (pla(2)) enzymes were examined to evaluate the antibacterial activity of purified venom enzymes as compared with that of the crude venoms. methods and results: thirty-four crude venoms, nine purified pla(2)s and two l-amino acid oxidases (laao) were studied for antibacterial activity by disc-diffusion assay (100 microg ml(-1)). several snake venoms (daboia russelli russelli, crotalus adamanteus, naja sumatrana, pseudechis guttata, agkistrodon halys, acanthophis praelongus and daboia russelli siamensis) showed activity against two to four different pathogenic bacteria. daboia russelli russelli and pseudechis australis  venoms exhibited the most potent activity against staphylococcus aureus, while the rest showed only a moderate activity against one or more bacteria. the order  of susceptibility of the bacteria against viperidae venoms was -s. aureus > proteus mirabilis > proteus vulgaris > enterobacter aerogenes > pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) against s. aureus was studied by dilution method (160-1.25 microg ml(-1)). a stronger effect was noted with the viperidae venoms (20 microg ml(-11)) as compared with elapidae venoms (40 microg ml(-1)). the mic were comparable with those of the standard drugs (chloramphenicol, streptomycin and penicillin). conclusion: the present findings indicate that viperidae (d. russelli russelli) and elapidae (p. australis) venoms have significant antibacterial effects against gram (+) and gram (-) bacteria, which may be the result of the primary antibacterial components of laao, and in particular, the pla(2) enzymes. the results would be useful for further purification and characterization of antibacterial agents from snake venoms. significance and impact of the study: the activity of laao and pla(2) enzymes may be associated with the antibacterial activity of snake venoms.

TI  == detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among enterobacteriaceae by use of semiautomated microbiology systems and manual detection procedures.
AB  == three commercially available microbiology identification and susceptibility testing systems were compared with regard to their ability to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production in enterobacteriaceae, i.e., the phoenix automated microbiology system (bd diagnostic systems, sparks, md), the vitek 2 system (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france), and the microscan walkaway-96 system (dade behring, inc., west sacramento, ca), using routine testing panels. one hundred fifty putative esbl producers were distributed blindly to three participating laboratories. conventional phenotypic confirmatory tests such as the disk approximation method, the clsi double-disk synergy test, and the etest esbl were also evaluated. biochemical and molecular characterization of beta-lactamases performed at an independent laboratory was used as the reference method. one hundred forty-seven isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, and morganella morganii were investigated. of these  isolates, 85 were identified as esbl producers by the reference method. the remaining isolates were identified as non-esbl producers; they were either hyperproducers of their chromosomal ampc, koxy, or shv enzymes or lacked any detectable beta-lactamase activity. the system with the highest sensitivity for the detection of esbls was the phoenix (99%), followed by the vitek 2 (86%) and the microscan (84%); however, specificity was more variable, ranging from 52% (phoenix) to 78% (vitek 2). the performance of the semiautomated systems differed widely with the species investigated. the sensitivities of the conventional test  methods ranged from 93 to 94%. the double-disk synergy test showed the highest specificity and positive predictive value among all test methods, i.e., 97% and 98%, respectively.

TI  == ft-ir microspectroscopy for early identification of some clinically relevant pathogens.
AB  == aims: to investigate the potentials and limitations of fourier transform-infrared (ft-ir) microspectroscopy as a tool to identify, at the level of microcolonies, pathogenic bacteria frequently isolated in the clinical environment. methods and  results: a total of 1570 ft-ir spectra from 164 gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients were recorded from 6 to 10-h old microcolonies of 50-150 microm size. a classification of 100% was obtained for the most frequent gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium at the species level. an average accuracy of about 80% was reached with gram negative bacteria from the enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonaceae families; enterobacter aerogenes,  enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella spp., and citrobacter koseri; and proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli. results were comparable with ft-ir measurements on dried suspensions from 18-h cultures. conclusions: early identification of young microcolonies is feasible with ft-ir microscopy with a very high accuracy for gram-positive bacteria. some improvement in the transfer of microcolonies is  necessary to increase the accuracy for gram-negative bacteria. significance and impact of the study: combination of ft-ir microscopy and multivariate data analysis could be a complementary, rapid, and reliable tool for screening and discriminating, at species and subspecies level, micro-organisms of clinical, food-borne, or environmental origins.

TI  == 1h nmr spectroscopy in the diagnosis of klebsiella pneumoniae-induced urinary tract infection.
AB  == the (1)h nmr spectroscopic method is suggested and its utility is demonstrated for the diagnosis of klebsiella pneumoniae (k. pneumoniae) in urinary tract infection (uti). k. pneumoniae have the specific property of metabolizing glycerol to 1,3-propanediol (1,3-pd), acetate, ethanol and succinate. the quantity of 1,3-pd produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. other common bacteria causing uti (except for citrobacter frundii), such as escherichia coli (e. coli), pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa), enterobacter  aerogenes, acinetobacter baumanii, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus gp b and staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize glycerol under similar conditions. citrobacter frundii (c. frundii) also gives the same nmr results but is easily differentiated as being motile on direct microscopic examination of urine and it is not common nosocomial infectious agent in urinary  tract infection. the method provides a single-step documentation of k. pneumoniae (and c. frundii) qualitatively as well as quantitatively. out of the total 614 subjects considered, clinical diagnosis of uti was obtained in 516 cases (84%). the nmr-based screening had a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 100% and a false negativity of 10% relative to the conventional quantitative culture method. in the present authors' experience, the results of nmr spectroscopy based screening show a very good correlation with the diagnosis of urinary tract infected patients.

AB  == mexican tarragon (tagetes lucida cv. asteraceae: campanulatae) is an important, nutritious plant and an effective herbal medicine. seven coumarins, 7,8-dihydroxycoumarin (4), umbelliferone (7-hydroxycoumarin) (5), scoparone (6,7-dimethoxycoumarin) (7), esculetin (6,7-dihydroxycoumarin) (11), 6-hydroxy-7-methoxycoumarin (12), herniarin (7-methoxycoumarin) (13), and scopoletin (6-methoxy-7-hydroxycoumarin) (14), and three flavonoids, patuletin (18), quercetin (19), and quercetagetin (20), were isolated from ch2cl2 and meoh  extracts from aerial parts of t. lucida. in addition, 6,7-diacetoxy coumarin (15), 6-methoxy-7-acetylcoumarin (16), and 6-acetoxy-7-methoxycoumarin (17) derivatives were synthesized. 8-methoxypsoralen (1), 8-acetyl-7-hydroxycoumarin (2), 7,8-dihydroxy-6-meth-oxycoumarin (3), 6,7-dimethoxy-4-methylcoumarin (6), 5,7-dihydroxy-4-methylcoumarin (8), 4-hydroxycoumarin (9), 4-hydroxy-6,7-dimethylcoumarin (10), naringenin (21), glycoside-7-rhamnonaringin  (22), and rutin (23) were commercially obtained (sigma-aldrich). all of these compounds and extracts (m1 and m2) were assayed against bacteria and fungi. the antibacterial activity was determined on bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhi, salmonella sp., shigella boydii, shigella sp., enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter agglomerans,  sarcina lutea, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterolitica, vibrio cholerae (three el tor strains, cdc-v12, clinic case, and indre-206, were obtained from contaminated water), and v. cholerae (no-o1). the evaluated fungi were aspergillus niger, penicillium notatum, fusarium moniliforme, fusarium sporotrichum, rhizoctonia solani, and trichophyton mentagrophytes. the most active compounds against gram-positive and -negative bacteria were the dihydroxylated coumarins 3 and 4. in addition, 2-4, 6, 7, and 11 showed an interesting activity against v. cholerae, a key bacterium in the contaminated water; 2-4 were the most active. coumarins were the most effective compounds against gram-negative bacteria. the extract meoh/ch2cl2 (1: 4) m2 at 0.4 microg/disk inhibited the growth of e. coli and p. mirabilis (40%), k. pneumoniae (31.1%), salmonella sp. (35.5%), and shigella sp. (0%) at 72 h of culture. the dimethoxy compounds 6 and 7 showed a strong activity against fungal  strains, especially t. mentagrophytes and r. solani (100% of inhibition at 125.0  and 250.0 microg/ml, respectively).

TI  == antibiotic resistance in outpatient urinary isolates: final results from the north american urinary tract infection collaborative alliance (nautica).
AB  == the goal of the north american urinary tract infection collaborative alliance (nautica) study was to determine antibiotic susceptibility to commonly used agents for urinary tract infections against outpatient urinary isolates obtained  in various geographic regions in the usa and canada. forty-one medical centres (30 from the usa and 11 from canada) participated, with each centre submitting up to 50 consecutive outpatient midstream urine isolates. isolates were identified to species level by the standard protocol of each laboratory. susceptibility testing was determined using the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) microdilution method. resistance breakpoints used were those published by the nccls, including: ampicillin (resistant > or = 32 microg/ml), sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim (smx/tmp) (resistant > or = 4 microg/ml), nitrofurantoin (resistant > or = 128 microg/ml), ciprofloxacin (resistant > or =  4 microg/ml) and levofloxacin (resistant > or = 8 microg/ml). of the 1990 isolates collected, 75.1% (1494) were collected from the usa and 24.9% (496) were collected from canada. the mean age of the patients was 48.3 years (range 1 month to 99 years), and 79.5% and 20.5% of isolates were obtained from women and men, respectively. the most common organisms were escherichia coli (57.5%), klebsiella pneumoniae (12.4%), enterococcus spp. (6.6%), proteus mirabilis (5.4%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.9%), citrobacter spp. (2.7%), staphylococcus aureus (2.2%), enterobacter cloacae (1.9%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (1.3%), staphylococcus saprophyticus (1.2%), klebsiella spp. (1.2%), enterobacter aerogenes (1.1%) and streptococcus agalactiae (1.0%). among all 1990 isolates, 45.9% were resistant to ampicillin, 20.4% to smx/tmp, 14.3% to nitrofurantoin, 9.7% to ciprofloxacin and 8.1% to levofloxacin. fluoroquinolone resistance was highest in patients > or = 65 years of age. for the 1142 e. coli isolates, resistance rates were: ampicillin 37.7%, smx/tmp 21.3%, ciprofloxacin 5.5%, levofloxacin 5.1% and nitrofurantoin 1.1%. for all 1990 isolates and for the 1142 e. coli only, resistance rates were significantly higher in us compared with canadian medical centres. this study reports higher rates of antibiotic resistance in us versus canadian outpatient urinary isolates and demonstrates the continuing evolution of resistance to antimicrobial agents.

AB  == the uro-quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. in order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (nccls) and the uro-quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. the shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli and for esbl- and inhibitor-resistant tem (irt)-producing e. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). the same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation  and efflux-mediated), streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and m-type) and klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis and moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (oxa-r) staphylococcus aureus and oxa-r staphylococcus epidermidis. the same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by pseudomonas aeruginosa. teicoplanin-resistant staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (vana, vanb, vanc) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (hlar) enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. the results obtained indicate that uro-quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.

TI  == evaluation of a new cefepime-clavulanate esbl etest to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in an enterobacteriaceae strain collection.
AB  == objectives: in this study, we evaluated the performance of a new esbl etest configuration based on clavulanate synergy with cefepime compared with cefotaxime-clavulanate and ceftazidime-clavulanate esbl etest strips for the detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) in an enterobacteriaceae strain collection, with special focus on enterobacter spp. methods: overall, a total of 54 clinical isolates of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae species were evaluated: enterobacter aerogenes (n=3), enterobacter cloacae (n=10), escherichia coli (n=10), klebsiella oxytoca (n=3), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=25) and proteus mirabilis (n=3). to check etest behaviour with resistance phenotypes similar to esbl, our panel was expanded by six clinical isolates of k. oxytoca that were identified as putative producers of their chromosomal k1 beta-lactamase. results: with this panel, esbl etest was 98% sensitive with cefepime-clavulanate, 83% with cefotaxime-clavulanate, and 74% with ceftazidime-clavulanate strips. concentrating on enterobacter spp., reliable esbl detection could only be achieved by the new cefepime-clavulanate strip since it confirmed esbl production in all strains (100% sensitivity) whereas only 4/13 (31%) of enterobacter strains were positive using cefotaxime-clavulanate or ceftazidime-clavulanate strips. a limitation of using the new cefepime strip was less than optimal specificity with k1 phenotypes of k. oxytoca: among six strains, four isolates were scored false-positive by etest strips containing cefepime-clavulanate. conclusion: the new etest esbl strip containing cefepime-clavulanate is a valuable supplement to  current methods for detection of esbls. in our study collection, the cefepime-clavulanate strip was the best configuration for detection of esbls, particularly in enterobacter spp.

TI  == molecular details of urease inhibition by boric acid: insights into the catalytic mechanism.
AB  == the structure of the complex of urease, a ni-containing metalloenzyme, with boric acid was determined at 2.10 a resolution. the complex shows the unprecedented binding mode of the competitive inhibitor to the dinuclear metal center, with the b(oh)3 molecule bridging the ni ions and leaving in place the bridging hydroxide. boric acid can be considered a substrate analogue of urea, and the structure supports the proposal that the ni-bridging hydroxide acts as the nucleophile in the enzymatic process of urea hydrolysis.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. changes in czop susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, serratia liquefaciens, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter iwoffii,  burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, bacteroides fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas. czop preserved its antibacterial activity against m. (b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the  mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and  0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity  of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of  czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

TI  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae in community and private health care centers.
AB  == in 1999, 39 of 2,599 isolates of the family enterobacteriaceae (1.5%) collected by eight private laboratories in the aquitaine region in france produced an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl). among these were 19 enterobacter aerogenes isolates; 8 klebsiella pneumoniae isolates; 6 escherichia coli isolates; 3 proteus mirabilis isolates; and 1 isolate each of serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, and providencia stuartii. esbl producers were isolated from 38 patients, including 33 residents of 11 clinics or nursing homes  and 5 ambulatory patients. seven different esbls were characterized. these mainly consisted of tem-24 (25 isolates) and tem-21 (9 isolates), but tem-15 (2 isolates) and tem-3, tem-19, shv-4, and ctx-m-1 (1 isolate each) were also characterized. seven strains showed the coexistence of different tem- and/or shv-encoding genes, including a new shv-1 variant, shv-44, defined by the substitution r205l previously reported for shv-3 in association with s238g. the epidemiology of the esbl producers was investigated by random amplification of polymorphic dna, typing by enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus pcr, analysis of resistance cotransferred with the esbl, and analysis of the restriction profiles of the esbl-encoding plasmids. of the tem-24-expressing strains, 18 were e. aerogenes isolates, including 9 from the same clinic, that were representatives of the epidemic clone disseminating in france. of the tem-21-producing strains that belonged to different species of the family enterobacteriaceae (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis), 8 were isolated in the same nursing home. outbreaks due to strain and/or plasmid dissemination in these clinic and nursing home were demonstrated. the presence of esbl producers in five ambulatory patients probably resulted from nosocomial acquisition. our data highlight the serious need to monitor patients for esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae in general practice.

TI  == are infections due to resistant pathogens associated with a worse outcome in critically ill patients?
AB  == objectives: to evaluate the outcome of critically ill patients infected with antimicrobial resistant microorganisms, and to analyse the factors involved in the development of antimicrobial resistance. methods: all patients admitted to a  31-bed mixed medico-surgical intensive care unit who developed a nosocomial infection were prospectively followed until discharge or death. results: of 949 consecutive patients admitted, 186 developed a nosocomial infection: 79 with an antimicrobial-resistant pathogen and 107 with susceptible strains. the lungs were the main source of infections in both groups. the main resistant microorganisms were enterobacter aerogenes, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa),  and enterobacter cloacae. the main susceptible microorganisms were enterobacter spp., methicillin susceptible s. aureus (mssa), and proteus mirabilis. patients infected with resistant strains had a longer length of stay prior to infection (9+/-4 vs. 5+/-3 days), longer total length of stay (18+/-16 vs. 11+/-7 days), longer duration of mechanical ventilation (12+/-15 vs. 6+/-7 days), and more severe coagulation, liver, and renal dysfunction (all p<0.05). the maximum degrees of organ failure during the icu stay, and the respiratory dysfunction, but not infection with a resistant pathogen, were independent predictors for death. multivariate logistic regression revealed previous use of multiple antibiotics, duration of length of stay prior to infection, and the degree of liver failure as independent factors for development of infection with resistant  organisms. conclusions: infection with antimicrobial resistant microorganisms is  not an independent predictor for death. the development of antimicrobial resistance is related to the previous use of multiple antibiotics, the icu length of stay, and the severity of hepatic dysfunction.

TI  == in vitro susceptibilities of gram-negative bacteria isolated from hospitalized patients in four european countries, canada, and the united states in 2000-2001 to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and comparator antimicrobials: implications for therapy.
AB  == access to current antimicrobial agent surveillance data is an important prerequisite for the optimal management of patients with hospital-acquired infections. the present study used data collected in 2000 to 2001 from 670 laboratories in europe (france, germany, italy, and spain), canada, and the united states to report on the in vitro activities of ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and comparative agents against >125,000 isolates of gram-negative bacteria from hospitalized patients. all but two isolates of enterobacteriaceae (one isolate of proteus mirabilis from france and one isolate of morganella morganii from canada) were susceptible to imipenem. the susceptibility of escherichia coli to ceftriaxone or cefotaxime was > or = 97% in each country, and for p. mirabilis, susceptibility was 99% in each country except italy. in contrast, susceptibility  of e. coli to ciprofloxacin varied from 80.5% (spain) to 94.0% (france); levofloxacin susceptibility ranged from 75.2% (spain) to 91.6% (united states). among klebsiella pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca isolates, ceftriaxone and cefotaxime susceptibilities ranged from 86.6 to 98.7% and 83.5 to 99.7%, respectively, depending upon the country. considerable geographic variation in the susceptibilities (generally 85 to 95% susceptible) of serratia marcescens and m. morganii to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime were observed. for s. marcescens, susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam varied from 81.5% (france) to 94.1% (italy) and susceptibility to ciprofloxacin ranged from 66.2% (germany) to 90.7%  (spain). enterobacter cloacae and enterobacter aerogenes were less susceptible to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime than were the other species of enterobacteriaceae studied. the present study demonstrated that established parenteral expanded-spectrum cephalosporin antimicrobial agents retain significant in vitro  activity against many clinically important gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in enterobacteriaceae in buenos aires, argentina, public hospitals.
AB  == resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins is often associated with plasmid encoded extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl). in order to evaluate the prevalence and diversity of esbls in enterobacteria in our city, a 1-month-period survey was carried out from april to may 2000. extended-spectrum-cephalosporin-resistant strains, isolated from inpatient clinical specimens other than stools, were collected among 17 participating hospitals. from a total of 427 enterobacterial strains that were collected during this period, 39 were extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistant. the national committee for clinical laboratory standards' screening and confirmatory tests for esbl production were performed using cefotaxime and ceftazidime; cefepime and cefepime-clavulanic acid-containing disks were included. beta-lactamases were characterized by isoelectric focusing and pcr amplification using specific primers. three different esbls were detected: shv-related (4 isolates), per-2-type (9 isolates), and ctx-m-2-related (26 isolates). sequencing of the corresponding genes confirmed ctx-m-2 in 19 of 21 and ctx-m-31 (an allelic variant) in the remaining 2 of 21. ctx-m-2 (or its variant) was detected in all escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, and providencia stuartii strains, while per-2 was detected in enterobacter cloacae, e. aerogenes, and klebsiella pneumoniae; shv-related esbl were found only in k. pneumoniae. these results clearly show that ctx-m-2 is the most prevalent esbl produced by enterobacterial species isolated from public hospitals in buenos aires.

TI  == characterization of clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae from italy by the bd  phoenix extended-spectrum beta-lactamase detection method.
AB  == production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) is an important mechanism of beta-lactam resistance in enterobacteriaceae: identification of esbls based on phenotypic tests is the strategy most commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories. the phoenix esbl test (bd diagnostic systems, sparks, md.) is a recently developed automated system for detection of esbl-producing gram-negative bacteria. an algorithm based on phenotypic responses to a panel of cephalosporins (ceftazidime plus clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, cefotaxime plus clavulanic acid,  cefpodoxime, and ceftriaxone plus clavulanic acid) was used to test 510 clinical  isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus  mirabilis, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, and citrobacter  koseri. of these isolates, 319 were identified as esbl producers, and the remaining 191 were identified as non-esbl producers based on the results of current phenotypic tests. combined use of isoelectric focusing, pcr, and/or dna sequencing demonstrated that 288 isolates possessed bla(tem-1)- and/or bla(shv-1)-derived genes, and 28 had a bla(ctx-m) gene. among the 191 non-esbl-producing isolates, 77 isolates produced an ampc-type enzyme, 110 isolates possessed tem-1, tem-2, or shv-1 beta-lactamases, and the remaining four isolates (all k. oxytoca strains) hyperproduced k1 chromosomal beta-lactamase. the phoenix esbl test system gave positive results for all the 319 esbl-producing isolates and also for two of the four k1-hyperproducing isolates of k. oxytoca. compared with the phenotypic tests and molecular analyses, the phoenix system displayed 100% sensitivity and 98.9% specificity. these findings suggest that the phoenix esbl test can be a rapid and reliable method for laboratory detection of  esbl resistance in gram-negative bacteria.

AB  == to determine the function of the waae gene in the biosynthesis of the inner-core  lps of klebsiella pneumoniae, a waae non-polar mutant has been constructed. data  obtained from the comparative chemical analysis of lps samples obtained from the  wild-type, the mutant strain and the complemented mutant demonstrated that the waae gene is involved in substitution of alpha-l-glycero-d-manno-heptopyranose i  (l,d-heppi) at the o-4 position by a beta-d-glucopyranose (beta-d-glcp) residue.  in addition, dna amplification and nucleotide sequence determination studies revealed that waae homologues located between the waaa and coad genes are present in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae containing the structure beta-d-glcp-(1-->4)-alpha-l,d-heppi (k. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and yersinia enterocolitica), as well as in strains of serratia marcescens and enterobacter aerogenes of unknown lps-core structures. complementation studies using non-polar waae mutants prove that all the waae homologues perform the same  function. furthermore, k. pneumoniae, ser. marcescens and p. mirabilis non-polar  waae mutants showed reduced adhesion and pathogenicity. in addition, the ser. marcescens and p. murabilis waae mutants showed reduced swarming motility and ability to form biofilms in vitro. all these characteristics were rescued by reintroduction of the waae gene independently of its origin. an easy dna amplification method to detect this gene was established, which also helps in finding the potential presence of this structural feature [beta-d-glcp-(1-->4)-alpha-l,d-heppi] in the inner-core lps of enterobacteriaceae members with unknown lps-core structures.

AB  == the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production by consecutive non-repeated isolates of enterobacteriaceae was determined over a 6-month period. a total of 8015 strains were isolated from ten italian laboratories and 509 (6.3%) of these were designated esbl producers from the results of a double-disk synergy test. escherichia coli was the most isolated microrganism, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis. providencia stuartii (28.1%) was the most frequently isolated esbl producer, followed by k. pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes (20.5%). however, amongst all esbl producers, k. pneumoniae (38.2%) was the most represented followed by p. mirabilis (25.7%). all the strains positive to dd tests were confirmed for the carriage of tem and shv genes using colony-blot hybridisation (ch). a total of 447 strains (88.0%) were ch-positive, of which 42.3% hybridised with the tem-type probe, 30.1% with the shv-type probe and 15.6% with both probes. in conclusion, our findings indicate that 6.3% of all enterobacteriaceae tested produced esbls,  42.3% of which were tem-derived enzymes. more than 20% of p. stuartii, k. pneumoniae and e. aerogenes harbour these enzymes. the double-disk test seems to  be a useful test to identify esbl producing strains.

AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == phenotypic variability of beta-glucoside utilization and its correlation to pathogenesis process in a few enteric bacteria.
AB  == utilization of beta-glucosides is markedly variable in the members of the family  enterobacteriaceae. the results presented here provide molecular clues for evolutionary events that resulted in the phenotypic variability seen amongst the  members of these species. the genomic hybridization of selected enterobacteriaceae members with the escherichia coli bgl and cel genes resulted in detection of a complete homolog of the bgl and cel operons in shigella sonnei, a member that is evolutionarily closest to e. coli. however, the salmonella group of organisms have been shown to carry only a homolog of bglr and bglg regions and the deletions of the bglf and bglb genes. similarly, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter aerogenes and a non-enteric gram-negative bacterium pseudomonas aeruginosa have been shown to carry a homolog of the bglr and bglg regions and deletions of the bglf and bglb genes. the homolog of the cel operon could be identified in s. sonnei and salmonella groups of organisms. possible implications of these observations, in connection with the phenotypic variability seen in beta-glucoside utilization amongst these members, are discussed.

TI  == in vitro susceptibility of nosocomial isolates against a new aminoglycoside isepamicin.
AB  == background and objectives: isepamicin is a new aminoglycoside with a spectrum of  activity similar to amikacin with an advantage of possessing a high level of stability against different aminoglycoside modifying enzymes. the in vitro susceptibility of nosocomial isolates obtained from patients admitted to the all  india institute of medical sciences, new delhi during october-december, 1999 was  tested against isepamicin and compared with other aminoglycosides. methods: a total of 251 clinical isolates were studied which included escherichia coli 87, klebsiella pneumoniae 54, pseudonomas aeruginosa 38, staphylococcus aureus 27 (methicillin resistant s. aureus 15, methicillin sensitive s. aureus 12), acinetobacter species 26, enterobacter aerogenes 9, proteus mirabilis 5, proteus  vulgaris 2, and citrobacter species 3. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) against isepamicin and other aminoglycosides including amikacin, gentamicin, netilmicin and tobramycin was done using nccls guidelines. the cut-off values of  isepamicin were used as that of amikacin. results: we found that overall 153 nosocomial isolates were sensitive to isepamicin as compared to 95 for amikacin in this hospital. isepamicin showed a superior in vitro activity compared to the  other aminoglycosides tested. interpretation and conclusions: isepamicin can be a good alternative in multidrug resistant nosocomial isolates in hospitals where amikacin resistance is emerging.

TI  == cost-effective and rapid presumptive identification of gram-negative bacilli in routine urine, pus, and stool cultures: evaluation of the use of chromagar orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests.
AB  == the algorithm for a new identification system was designed on the basis of colony color and morphology on chromagar orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests such as indole (ind), lysine decarboxylase (ldc), and ornithine decarboxylase (odc) utilization tests with gram-negative bacilli isolated from urine samples as well as pus, stool, and other clinical specimens by the following colony characteristics, biochemical reactions, and serological results: pinkish to red, ind positive (ind(+)), escherichia coli; metallic blue, ind(+), ldc(+), and odc negative (odc(-)), klebsiella oxytoca; ind(+), ldc(-), and odc(+), citrobacter diversus; ind(+) or ind(-), ldc(-), and odc(-), citrobacter freundii; ind(-), ldc(+), and odc(+), enterobacter aerogenes; ind(-), ldc(-), and odc(+), enterobacter cloacae; ind(-), ldc(+), and odc(-), klebsiella pneumoniae;  diffuse brown and ind(+), morganella morganii; ind(-), proteus mirabilis; aqua blue, serratia marcescens; bluish green and ind(+), proteus vulgaris; transparent yellow-green, serology positive, pseudomonas aeruginosa; clear and serology positive, salmonella sp.; other colors and reactions, the organism was identified by the full identification methods. the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of this new system were prospectively evaluated. during an 8-month period, a total of 345 specimens yielded one or more gram-negative bacilli. a total of 472 gram-negative bacillus isolates were detected on chromagar orientation medium. for 466 of the isolates (98.7%), no discrepancies in the results were obtained on the basis of the identification algorithm. the cost of identification of gram-negative bacilli during this period was reduced by about 70%. the results of this trial for the differentiation of the most commonly encountered gram-negative pathogens in clinical specimens with the new algorithm were favourable in that it permitted reliable detection and presumptive identification. in addition, this rapid identification system not only significantly reduced costs but it also improved the daily work flow within the clinical microbiology laboratory.

TI  == a novel ctx-m beta-lactamase (ctx-m-8) in cefotaxime-resistant enterobacteriaceae isolated in brazil.
AB  == to estimate the diversity of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in brazil, 18 strains from different species of the family enterobacteriaceae exhibiting a positive double-disk synergy test were collected by a clinical laboratory from several hospitals in rio de janeiro, brazil, in 1996 and 1997. four strains (proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and citrobacter amalonaticus) hybridized with a 550-bp ctx-m probe. the p. mirabilis strain produced a ctx-m-2 enzyme. the e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, and c. amalonaticus isolates harbored a bla gene which was identified by cloning and sequencing as a  bla(ctx-m) gene. e. coli hb101 transconjugants and the e. coli dh5alpha transformant harboring a recombinant plasmid produced a ctx-m beta-lactamase with an isoelectric point of 7.6 conferring a resistance phenotype characterized by a  higher level of resistance to cefotaxime than to ceftazidime, as observed with the other ctx-m enzymes. the deduced protein sequence showed a novel ambler class a ctx-m enzyme, named ctx-m-8, which had 83 to 88% identity with the previously described ctx-m enzymes. the phylogenic study of the ctx-m family including ctx-m-8 revealed four ctx-m types, ctx-m-8 being the first member of a new phylum of ctx-m enzymes. the evolutionary distances between the four types of ctx-m were large, suggesting that the four clusters branched off early from a distant unknown enzyme and that intermediate enzymes probably existed.

TI  == mixed infection in adult bacterial meningitis.
AB  == 12 adult patients suffering from bacterial meningitis caused by mixed infection were identified at kaohsiung chang gung memorial hospital over a period of 13 years (1986-1998), and they accounted for 6.5% (12/184) of our culture-proven adult bacterial meningitis. the 12 cases included seven males and five females, aged 17-74 years. six of the 12 cases had community-acquired infections and the other six had nosocomially-acquired infections. ten of the 12 cases had associated underlying diseases, with head trauma and/or neurosurgical procedure being the most frequent. both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens were identified in these 12 cases with gram-negative pathogens outnumbering the gram-positive ones. the implicated pathogens, starting with the most frequent, included enterobacter species (enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), klebsiella species (klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca), escherichia coli, staphylococcus species (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus), pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus, serratia marcescens, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus viridans and neisseria meningitidis. six of the 12 cases were found to have multi-antibiotic-resistant strains, which included e. cloacae in one, a. baumannii in one, k. pneumoniae in one and s. aureus in three. the management of  these 12 cases included appropriate antibiotics and neurosurgical procedures including shunt revision. despite the complexity of implicated pathogens and the  high incidence of emergence of resistant strains, the overall mortality rate (8.3%, 1/12) was not higher than that in adult bacterial meningitis. however, complete recuperation was difficult in adult patients with mixed bacterial meningitis.

TI  == impact of use of multiple antimicrobials on changes in susceptibility of gram-negative aerobes.
AB  == evaluation of antimicrobial usage vs. susceptibility relationships typically involves single agents. however, susceptibility profiles may be affected by multiple drugs. from 1992 through 1996, we studied relationships between drug usage and the susceptibility (only susceptibility rates of > or = 70%) of acinetobacter anitratus (baumannii), enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, and serratia marcescens to 22 agents. linear regression was used to assess usage of each agent vs. susceptibility to it and to all agents. only relationships with a coefficient of determination of > or = 0.5 and a negative slope were evaluated and classified as increasing drug use and decreasing susceptibility (increasing d, decreasing %s) or decreasing drug use and increasing susceptibility (decreasing d, increasing %s). the mean numbers (range) of drugs associated with a change in susceptibility were 1.7 (0-14) and 0.6 (0-7), respectively, for increasing d, decreasing %s and decreasing d, increasing %s relationships. multiple antimicrobials are associated with susceptibility to other drugs; thus, surveillance of these relationships should not be limited to single drugs.

AB  == the results of the semi-annual nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities, conducted by the japanese ministry of health and welfare during the period of january 1993 to july 1995, were analyzed for typical gram-negative  bacilli in the purpose of provision of an index for antimicrobial selection. during these 3 years, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes and proteus mirabilis showed slightly increasing tendency in susceptibility to fosfomycin (fom) and citrobacter freundii. klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes showed slightly increasing tendency to minocycline (mino). while haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae showed slightly decreasing tendency to cefmetazole (cmz). however, these annual changes were almost negligible. generally, these microorganisms showed relatively good susceptibilities, every year, to the principal antimicrobial agents being approved for use against gram-negative bacilli. however, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed tendencies of decreased susceptibility to some of the antimicrobial agents. on the other hand, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (st), cmz, latamoxef (lmox), gentamicin (gm) and amikacin (amk) showed good activities against some of the gram-negative bacilli to which no indications are approved. in conclusion, bedside the identification of the causative microorganisms and the performance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, such analyses (graphics of susceptibility tendency of clinical isolates to variety of antimicrobial agents) could be used as an index for selection of antimicrobial agents, when emergent and urgent selection of antimicrobial agents is necessary.

TI  == chromosomally encoded ampc-type beta-lactamase in a clinical isolate of proteus mirabilis.
AB  == a clinical strain of proteus mirabilis (cf09) isolated from urine specimens of a  patient displayed resistance to amoxicillin (mic >4,096 microg/ml), ticarcillin (4,096 microg/ml), cefoxitin (64 microg/ml), cefotaxime (256 microg/ml), and ceftazidime (128 microg/ml) and required an elevated mic of aztreonam (4 microg/ml). clavulanic acid did not act synergistically with cephalosporins. two  beta-lactamases with apparent pis of 5.6 and 9.0 were identified by isoelectric focusing on a gel. substrate and inhibition profiles were characteristic of an ampc-type beta-lactamase with a pi of 9.0. amplification by pcr with primers for  ampc genes (escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, and citrobacter freundii) of  a 756-bp dna fragment from strain cf09 was obtained only with c. freundii-specific primers. hybridization results showed that the ampc gene is only chromosomally located while the tem gene is plasmid located. after cloning of the gene, analysis of the complete nucleotide sequence (1,146 bp) showed that  this ampc gene is close to blacmy-2, from which it differs by three point mutations leading to amino acid substitutions glu --> gly at position 22, trp --> arg at position 201, and ser --> asn at position 343. ampc beta-lactamases derived from that of c. freundii (lat-1, lat-2, bil-1, and cmy-2) have been found in klebsiella pneumoniae, e. coli, and enterobacter aerogenes and have been reported to be plasmid borne. this is the first example of a chromosomally encoded ampc-type beta-lactamase observed in p. mirabilis. we suggest that it be  designated cmy-3.

TI  == identification of a common structural motif in the disordered n-terminal region of bacterial flagellins--evidence for a new class of fibril-forming peptides.
AB  == flagellin proteins lacking the n- or c-terminus form polymers of reduced filament stability and straight morphology, in contrast to the coiled native flagella. in  the present study, the n-terminal amino acid sequence of flagellins of the anaerobic beer spoilage bacteria pectinatus cerevisiiphilus and pectinatus frisingiensis as well as enterobacter aerogenes and pseudomonas sp. were determined. sequence similarity was revealed between these and the n-termini of all known eubacterial flagellins. synthetic peptides corresponding to the first 15 amino acid residues of the flagellins of pectinatus, campylobacter jejuni, e.  aerogenes or proteus mirabilis flagellins had a spontaneous tendency under physiological conditions to form 4-6 nm broad, 1-2 microm long fibrillar structures that had a tendency to form clusters. in contrast, the pectinatus peptide missing residues 1-3 did not form fibrils. the peptide missing residues 13-15 formed fibrils less easily, and the peptide missing residues 11-15 formed fibrils almost without clustering. in electron micrographs, the fibrillisation of the bacterial flagellar peptides resembled that of beta-amyloid and prion peptides. 1h-nmr and infrared spectroscopy studies with homology analysis indicate that although the flagellar n-terminal peptides are flexible with many conformational minima, they have a significant tendency to form beta-type structures and a loop in the middle of the peptide. the hydrophobic character of  the n-terminus together with the property of forming a conserved beta-strand-loop-beta-strand motif may be related to a mechanism involved in attaining the proper morphology and stability of the flagellar filament, by providing a device for facilitating the attachment of the flagellin monomers to each other. the flagellar peptides represent a new class of fibril-forming peptides.

TI  == [meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  == meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position c1  which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (dhp-1),  thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in c2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the pbps. it covers gram positive aerobes (staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, enterococcus faecalis, rhodococcus equi, listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, aeromonas, plesiomonas, vibrio, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria, moraxella) and anaerobes  (bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, clostridium, peptostreptococcus, and propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: p. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and h. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci,  streptococci and staphylococci). meropenem has no activity on enterococcus faecium, s. aureus resistant to methycillin, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the oprd porin (oprd2 in enterobacteria and p. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the pbps (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).

AB  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. the advantages of in vitro activity of fk037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (mic90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus (h-mrsa), (3) a strong activity against enterobacter spp. and citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (mic90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for escherichia coli,  0.1 microgram/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for haemophilus influenzae and proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, proteus vulgaris and enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis and moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for c. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant s. aureus (l-mrsa), enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for h-mrsa and serratia marcescens.  fk037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except mrsa, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except p. vulgaris and/or m. catarrhalis. the increase in mics of fk037 against 2 l-mrsa strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. fk037 was highly bactericidal against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa at the mic or higher. fk037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against h-mrsa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. against the other strains, fk037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against p. aeruginosa. transmission electron microscopic  studies revealed that fk037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in mrsa after 4 h incubation.

TI  == evaluation of rapid one system for identification of 379 strains in the family enterobacteriaceae and oxidase-negative, gram-negative nonfermenters.
AB  == the ability of the rapid one system (innovative diagnostic systems, inc., norcross, ga.) to identify 364 strains in the family enterobacteriaceae and 15 oxidase-negative, gram-negative, nonfermentative rods was evaluated. kits were inoculated with no. 2 mcfarland standard suspensions, and reactions were interpreted after 4 h of incubation at 35 degrees c. overall, the method correctly identified (to the species level or to the genus level for salmonellas  and non-shigella sonnei shigella species) 363 strains (95.8%) without additional  tests. for four strains (1.0%), additional tests were required to delineate the correct identification from a range of two or more possibilities; these included  one serratia liquefaciens (serratia marcescens or serratia liquefaciens), one serratia rubidaea (serratia rubidaea or serratia odorifera), one salmonella typhi (leminorella richardii or salmonella sp.) and one yersinia enterocolitica (yersinia frederiksenii, yersinia intermedia, or yersinia enterocolitica). twelve strains (3.2%) were misidentified or yielded codes with no identification; these  comprised one citrobacter amalonaticus (no identification), three enterobacter hormaechei (not in the rapid one database; two enterobacter amnigenus, one enterobacter sp.), one serratia liquefaciens (enterobacter cloacae), one serratia rubidaea (no identification), four serratia fonticola (not in rapid one database; two enterobacter aerogenes, one serratia marcescens, one not identified), one proteus mirabilis (proteus penneri), and one proteus vulgaris (providencia rustigianii). if the seven strains not included in the database had been excluded, correct identification rates would have risen to 97.6% without additional tests and 98.7% with additional tests, with misidentification rates dropping to 1.3%. the rapid one system is easy to set up and the results are easy to read, and the system provides an accurate, nonautomated commercially available method for the same-day identification of members of the family enterobacteriaceae and oxidase-negative, gram-negative nonfermenters.

TI  == comparative antimicrobial activity of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against > 500 bacterial isolates.
AB  == an agar dilution technique was used to compare the antimicrobial activities of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against 544 strains of bacterial isolates. among the five quinolone agents tested, ciprofloxacin was the most active. enoxacin was the most active after ciprofloxacin against escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, shigella spp., yersinia enterocolitica, and haemophilus influenzae with an mic90 of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. ofloxacin was the most active agent after ciprofloxacin against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter diversus, and legionella pneumophila with an mic of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. ciprofloxacin inhibited staphylococcus spp. and streptococcus spp., at < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. norfloxacin  and enoxacin had the same antimicrobial activity (mic90) against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae and some other gram-positive species, but these activities were weak when compared with ciprofloxacin. the results of this in vitro study show that ciprofloxacin is very active against gram-negative and gram-positive species.

TI  == survey of the prevalence of beta-lactamases amongst 1000 gram-negative bacilli isolated consecutively at the royal london hospital.
AB  == beta-lactamase expression was examined in 1000 consecutive gram-negative bacilli  isolated from urine, wound swab, sputum or blood specimens received at the microbiology laboratory of the royal london hospital. this survey, performed between january and april, 1991, followed a similar study undertaken in early 1982. the distribution of species was similar in the two surveys, except that the proportion of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates had increased from 11% in 1982 to 17.5% in the present study. this increase was balanced by a decreased proportion  of enterobacteria. amongst plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, tem-1 (especially),  tem-2, shv-1 and oxa types continued to predominate in enterobacteria. their frequency in escherichia coli was unchanged (46% in 1991 compared with 43% in 1982), but had increased from 5 to 22% amongst proteus mirabilis isolates. an apparent decrease in their frequency amongst enterobacter cloacae isolates, from  48% in 1982 to 17% in 1991, probably reflected changes to strain prevalence rather than enzyme prevalence. plasmid type beta-lactamases were present in fewer than 2% of p. aeruginosa isolates in both surveys. in the present study, chromosomal beta-lactamase derepression (constitutive hyperproduction) was detected in 10/76 isolates of e. cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, serratia spp. and morganella morganii, and in 2/170 p. aeruginosa isolates. these proportions were increased, compared with those seen the 1982 survey, though the significance was borderline (p approximately 0.05; chi 2 test). extended-spectrum plasmid mediated beta-lactamases, unknown in 1982, were  found in 11/70 klebsiellae pneumoniae isolates in the present study. ten of these organisms, representing at least five distinct strains, produced tem-10 enzyme, encoded by a plasmid of c. 90 kb; the remaining organism had an unidentified shv-derived enzyme.

TI  == [antibacterial activities of sisomicin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == to investigate antibacterial activities of sisomicin (siso), mics of siso as well as other aminoglycosides (ags) were determined against many clinical isolates which were obtained in 1991. results are summarized below: 1. no siso-resistant strains were observed among isolates of escherichia coli, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis and morganella morganii. 2. in comparison with the results of our previous study against isolates obtained in 1986, the rate of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was higher, and siso-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among the mrsa. also, siso-resistant strains of serratia marcescens increased. however, the rate of siso-resistant strains of  pseudomonas aeruginosa decreased, and among citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae and proteus vulgaris, siso-resistant strains did not increase over the years. 3. mics of siso against providencia rettgeri and providencia stuartii were high, suggesting that antibacterial activities of siso was weak against genus providencia. 4. for comparison, according to mics of ofloxacin and imipenem, new  quinolone-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among various organisms, and carbapenem-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa. 5. siso is still one of the useful ags in the 1990's since it  maintains its strong antibacterial activities against most clinical isolates obtained in recent years and its potential as a combination drug with beta-lactams is being reported.

TI  == detection of ciprofloxacin resistance in gram-negative bacteria due to alterations in gyra.
AB  == two plasmids containing the cloned escherichia coli wild-type gyra gene were used to transform ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative clinical isolates to screen for dna gyrase a-mediated quinolone resistance. the results show that the technique is simple and applicable to a wide range of gram-negative species including e. coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella aerogenes, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, campylobacter jejuni and neisseria gonorrhoeae. the use of an arithmetical mic series of dilutions (as opposed to standard geometrical ones) was found to be essential during screening  for the detection of altered gyrase a. the observations were consistent with the  suggestion that dna gyrase is highly conserved among different species of bacteria and that gyrase a-mediated resistance can occur in all.

TI  == novel plasmid vectors for gene cloning in pseudomonas.
AB  == novel host-vector systems have been developed for gene cloning in the metabolically versatile bacterial genus pseudomonas. we found that a new pseudomonas strain, pseudomonas flavida if-4, isolated from soil, carried two small cryptic plasmids, named pni10 and pni20. they were multi-copy, but not self-transmissible, and the genome size was 3.7 kb for pni10 and 2.9 kb for pni20. several types of cloning vectors containing a kanamycin or streptomycin resistance (kmr or smr) gene were constructed from pni10 and pni20. these plasmid vectors were efficiently transformed into several strains of pseudomonas at a frequency up to 4 x 10(5) transformants per 1 microgram plasmid dna by the usual  competent cell method. the vectors derived from pni10 replicated not only in pseudomonas but also in some other gram-negative enteric bacteria such as escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, and proteus mirabilis.

TI  == cefpodoxime: comparative antibacterial activity, influence of growth conditions,  and bactericidal activity.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime, the active metabolite of the new cephalosporin ester cefpodoxime proxetil, in comparison to cefixime, cefotiam, cefuroxime, and cefotaxime was determined against a broad spectrum of freshly isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. cefpodoxime was demonstrated to be inhibitory at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 90% of strains of moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli (beta-lactamase- negative strains), klebsiella spp., serratia spp., proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, providencia spp., and salmonella spp.  this antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was generally superior to that of cefuroxime and similar to that of cefixime. cefpodoxime was active at less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 50% of the members of beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter spp., and morganella morganii. cefpodoxime proved to be highly inhibitory against group a, b, and g streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90 less than 0.015 mg/l). the mics of cefpodoxime and those of the other cephalosporins were less than 2 mg/l for greater than or equal to 90% of the strains of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, with the exception of cefixime which had no activity with mics below 8 mg/l against these bacteria. pseudomonas spp., acinetobacter spp., and enterococcus spp. were resistant to cefpodoxime. the antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime was only to a minor degree influenced by different growth conditions with the exception of high inoculum sizes against some beta-lactamase producing strains of gram-negative bacilli.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == fimbrial types among respiratory isolates belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == bacterial attachment is believed to be an early step in gram-negative nosocomial  pneumonia. the frequency of fimbria-associated adhesins among respiratory pathogens has not been studied in detail. in this study isolates belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae, prospectively obtained from intensive care unit patients who were suspected of having nosocomial pneumonia, were examined for fimbria-associated adhesins. type 3, p, type 1, and other fimbrial phenotypes were identified by specific hemagglutination and electron microscopy. the klebsiella type 3 fimbrial phenotype was further characterized by using a monoclonal antibody. also, both type 3 and escherichia coli p fimbrial genotypes  were detected by using dna colony blot assays. the frequencies of genera or species isolated were as follows: enterobacter (38.6%), klebsiella (26.8%), serratia (17.7%), e. coli (13%), and proteus (5.2%). isolates of klebsiella oxytoca, k. pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae most commonly possessed the type 3 fimbrial phenotype and genotype. the phenotype and genotype for e. coli p fimbriae (46.2 and 50%, respectively), a known pathogenic determinant in the urinary tract, were detected more frequently than expected. in addition, a previously unspecified hemagglutinin that was specific for porcine erythrocytes was almost uniformly expressed among isolates of enterobacter aerogenes. finally, the expression of the type 1 fimbrial phenotype was widely detected among the isolates tested but notably absent among k. oxytoca and proteus mirabilis isolates. the frequency of the various fimbrial types identified suggests a role  for these bacterial organelles in adherence to respiratory epithelia.

TI  == interspecies compatibility of selenoprotein biosynthesis in enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == several species of enterobacteriaceae were investigated for their ability to synthesize selenium-containing macromolecules. seleniated trna species as well as seleniated polypeptides were formed by all organisms tested. two selenopolypeptides could be identified in most of the organisms which correspond  to the 80 kda and 110 kda subunits of the anaerobically induced formate dehydrogenase isoenzymes of e. coli. in those organisms possessing both isoenzymes, their synthesis was induced in a mutually exclusive manner dependent  upon whether nitrate was present during anaerobic growth. the similarity of the 80 kda selenopolypeptide among the different species was assessed by immunological and genetic analyses. antibodies raised against the 80 kda selenopolypeptide from e. coli cross-reacted with an 80 kda polypeptide in those  organisms which exhibited fermentative formate dehydrogenase activity. these organisms also contained genes which hybridised with the fdhf gene from e. coli.  in an attempt to identify the signals responsible for incorporation of selenium into the selenopolypeptides in these organisms we cloned a portion of the fdhf gene homologue from enterobacter aerogenes. the nucleotide sequence of the cloned 723 bp fragment was determined and it was shown to contain an in-frame tga (stop) codon at the position corresponding to that present in the e. coli gene. this fragment was able to direct incorporation of selenocysteine when expressed in the heterologous host, e. coli. moreover, the e. coli fdhf gene was expressed in salmonella typhimurium, serratia marcescens and proteus mirabilis, indicating a high degree of conservation of the seleniating system throughout the enterobacteria.

AB  == during 8 months from october 1986 to may 1987, the clinical efficacy of sulbactam/ampicillin (sbt/abpc) was evaluated in 63 pediatric inpatients with various infections. clinical efficacies were evaluable in 58 patients among them  (consisting of 2 patients with sepsis, 3 with tonsillitis, 12 with bronchitis, 6  with bronchopneumonia, 24 with pneumonia, 1 with phlegmon, 2 with lymphadenitis,  1 with impetigo and 7 with urinary tract infection) and were excellent in 40 patients and good in 17 with an overall efficacy rate of 98.3%. bacteriological efficacies were assessed in 25 patients and 27 strains of organisms (consisting of 3 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 2 streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 streptococcus pyogenes, 2 beta-streptococcus, 1 gram-positive cocci, 5 escherichia coli, 1 enterobacter aerogenes, 7 haemophilus influenzae, 2 haemophilus parainfluenzae, 1 branhamella catarrhalis, 1 proteus mirabilis and 1  salmonella subgenus i). bacteriological eradication rates were 88.9% for gram-positive organisms, 66.7% for gram-negative organisms and 74.1% overall. no  superinfection was observed in any of patients treated. side effects and clinical laboratory parameter abnormalities observed consisted of diarrhea in 7 (11.1%) of the 63 patients, eosinophilia in 2 (3.3%) of 61 tested, thrombocytosis in 3 (5.5%) of 55, elevation of direct bilirubin in 1 (3.3%) of 30, elevation of total bilirubin in 1 (3.1%) of 32, elevation of got in 4 (6.8%) of 59 and elevation of  gpt in 1 (1.7%) of 59 patients tested. as an effect on the hemostatic mechanism of this drug, pivka ii was detected in 1 patient (4.2%) of 24 tested, but findings of other coagulation tests were normal and none of patients showed bleeding tendency or inhibition of platelet aggregation. from the above results,  it appears that sbt/abpc is an efficacious and safe drug in the treatment of bacterial infections of pediatric patients.

TI  == [clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of sulbactam/cefoperazone].
AB  == sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz) is a preparation containing cpz and sbt, an inhibitor of beta-lactamases, at the ratio 1:1. the reliability of the sbt/cpz disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of mics and the utilization of the test in the evaluation of proper administrative doses were studied using 365 strains of clinical isolates. the antimicrobial activity of sbt/cpz was stronger than that of cpz alone. this increase in the antimicrobial activity due to the addition of sbt was well observed in the disc diffusion susceptibility test and mic values. the mic80 of sbt/cpz against staphylococcus aureus was 12.5 micrograms/ml, while that of cpz alone was 50 micrograms/ml. mic80s of sbt/cpz against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens and enterobacter aerogenes were smaller than those of cpz, and were 0.20, 12.5, 25 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. however, mic80s of sbt/cpz against staphylococcus epidermidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and  proteus vulgaris were not changed compared to those of cpz alone, and mic80s were 6.25, 0.20, 0.78, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. the reliability of the sbt/cpz disc diffusion susceptibility test in the quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was well demonstrated using commercialized 8 mm diameter discs (showa) and 6 mm diameter discs prepared in this laboratory, both of which  contained 30 micrograms of cpz and 30 micrograms of sbt. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, hence the sbt/cpz disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of approximate mic values. to interpret results of the showa sbt/cpz disc test, the following 4 category classification was used: ( inverted question mark) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, ( inverted question mark 3 micrograms/ml less than mic  less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml, ( inverted question mark15 micrograms/ml  less than mic less than or equal to 60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml. in both 6 and 8 mm diameter disc tests, when uniform break points  of inhibitory zone diameter were similarly applied to all strains isolated clinically, some strains of s. aureus, e. faecalis, and p. aeruginosa, brought false positive (susceptible) results showing slightly greater inhibitory zone diameters compared to mics. however, if different break points against p. aeruginosa as indicated in this study were applied and e. faecalis was excluded from the test, excellent results were obtained in the quantitative estimation of  mics. antimicrobial activities of antibiotic agents have been reported to be reduced by serum protein binding.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == in vitro activities of cefuzonam (czon) against 273 clinical isolates were studied through the evaluation of mic's and the results of disc susceptibility test. the mic's were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6)cfu/ml. the mic80's of czon against streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, haemophilus influenzae and citrobacter spp. were less than 0.20 microgram/ml. the mic80's against serratia marcescens and enterobacter aerogenes were both 6.25 micrograms/ml, and that against pseudomonas aeruginosa was 100 micrograms/ml. the mic80's against staphy-lococcus epidermidis were 25 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. approximately 70% of strains of s. aureus were inhibited at concentrations less than 1.56 microgram/ml. for the interpretation of the czon showa 30 micrograms disc susceptibility test a 4 category system was used. in the 4 category system for showa disc containing czon, the following classification inhibitory zone diameters has been proposed: ( ) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic less than 60 micrograms/ml. reliability of the czon  disc tests in estimating approximate mic values was studied using showa 30 micrograms discs and discs prepared in this laboratory containing 1-10 micrograms czon. a good negative correlation was observed between inhibitory zone diameters  and mic's, showing the reliability of the disc method. the results of the test using showa 30 micrograms disc against various clinical isolates were accurately  classified into the 4 groups except those against p. aeruginosa. some strains of  p. aeuruginosa showed false positive results, exhibiting relatively larger inhibitory zone diameters compared with mic's against these organisms. as czon is not effective against p. aeruginosa a much better overall correlation between mic's and the disc test would result when p. aeruginosa was excluded. with showa  30 micrograms discs of various cephalosporins, sub-classification of strains with mic less than 3 micrograms/ml cannot be achieved. in this study, however, it was  demonstrated that differentiation of strains with mic's less than 0.5-1.56 micrograms/ml was possible when discs containing 1-10 micrograms of czon were used. according to recent concepts on pharmacokinetics for antibiotics including  penetration of drugs into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding  of drugs appears to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in  the body.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == in vitro activities of latamoxef (lmox) against 249 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. lmox was highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis (except 2 out of 30 strains) and proteus vulgaris with mic values below 3.13 micrograms/ml. it was also active against enterobacter aerogenes with mic80  of 1.56 micrograms/ml. lmox was less active against serratia marcescens, inhibiting about 43% of strains at a level of 6.25 micrograms/ml. it was also less active against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, showing mic80 of 12.5 and 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. lmox was not active against enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the reliability of the lmox disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (difco), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of lmox. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, hence the lmox disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of lmox. for the interpretation of lmox disc test results, if uniform break points of zone diameters were used to test all bacteria, inhibitory zone diameters of showa discs used on staphylococcus were relatively large compared to mics determined, probably due to decarboxylation of lmox sodium salt in the discs. however, those of difco discs were not, because difco discs use lmox ammonium salt. both discs also showed relatively large inhibitory zone diameters  compared to mics determined against p. aeruginosa. using different break points from those used for other bacteria to interpret inhibition zones for staphylococcus and p. aeruginosa, these disc susceptivility tests should be useful to estimate approximate mics. a 3 category system for the interpretation of disc test results has been used in usa and europe, but a 4 category system is  generally used in japan. the 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to mic values as follows:  resistant (r) mic greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml, intermediate (i) mic 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (s) mic less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. the 4 category system uses break points as follows: mic less than  or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == in vitro activity of aztreonam against gram negative bacteria from clinical specimens and its comparison with other commonly used antibiotics.
AB  == a total of 755 gram negative bacteria isolated from clinical specimens were tested against aztreonam by the disc agar diffusion test. the strains of bacteria used in this study consisted of escherichia coli (314), enterobacter aerogenes (30), e. agglomerans (7), e. cloacae, (39), citrobacter diversus (9), c. freundii (13), hafnia alvei (3), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (10), klebsiella oxytoca (6), k. ozaenae (5), k. pneumoniae (107), morganella morganii (3), moraxella sp. (10), pasteurella multocida (1), proteus mirabilis (66), p. vulgaris (4), providencia rettgeri (12), p. stuartii (5), pseudomonas aeruginosa (85), p. fluorescens (2),  p. maltophila (7), salmonella sp. (1) and serratia marcescens (17). in vitro activity against aztreonam was compared with amikacin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalosporin, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, piperacillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and tobramycin. over 99% of e. coli and enterobacter species were susceptible to aztreonam. all the 118 strains of klebsiella, 87 strains of proteus-providencia and 17 strains of s. marcescens were also susceptible. aztreonam also showed good activity against p.  aeruginosa, inhibiting 90% of the 85 isolates tested.

TI  == interspecific reconstitution of maltose transport and chemotaxis in escherichia coli with maltose-binding protein from various enteric bacteria.
AB  == in escherichia coli, the periplasmic maltose-binding protein (mbp), the product of the male gene, is the primary recognition component of the transport system for maltose and maltodextrins. it is also the maltose chemoreceptor, in which capacity it interacts with the signal transducer tar (taxis to aspartate and some repellents). in studies of the maltose system in other members of the family enterobacteriaceae, we found that mbp is produced by salmonella typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and serratia marcescens. mbp from  all of these species cross-reacted with antibody against the e. coli protein and  had a similar molecular weight (about 40,000). the shigella flexneri and proteus  mirabilis strains we examined did not synthesize mbp. the isoelectric points of mbp from different species varied from the acid extreme of e. coli (4.8) to the basic extreme of e. aerogenes (8.9). all species with mbp transported maltose with high affinity, although the vmax for k. pneumoniae was severalfold lower than that for the other species. maltose chemotaxis was observed only in e. coli  and e. aerogenes. in s. typhimurium lt2, tar was completely inactive in maltose taxis, although it signaled normally in response to aspartate. mbp isolated from  all five species could be used to reconstitute maltose transport and taxis in a delta male strain of e. coli after permeabilization of the outer membrane with calcium.

TI  == the activity of cefbuperazone, a 7 alpha-methoxy 7 beta acyl ureido cephalosporin.
AB  == the activity of cefbuperazone, a 7 alpha-methoxy ureido cephalosporin, was determined against 726 clinical isolates. ninety percent of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, salmonella, and shigella species were inhibited by less than or equal to 6.3 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was more active than cefamandole, cefoxitin and piperacillin against these species. concentrations of 25 micrograms/ml of cefbuperazone were needed to inhibit serratia marcescens and providencia species, and 50% of enterobacter cloacae had mics greater than 25 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was less active by 8 to 32-fold than cefotaxime or moxalactam against most enterobacteriaceae. cefbuperazone did not inhibit acinetobacter or pseudomonas species. hemolytic streptococci were inhibited by 12.5 micrograms/ml  and staphylococci by 25 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone had activity comparable to cefoxitin and moxalactam against bacteroides fragilis with mic90s of 6.3 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was not hydrolyzed by plasmid or chromosomal beta-lactamases and was an inhibitor of the p99 e. cloacae beta-lactamase with an i50 of 1 microgram/ml. it was a less effective inhibitor of the k. oxytoca k1 and e. coli tem-1 beta-lactamases than was clavulanic acid. cefbuperazone induced beta-lactamases in p. aeruginosa and resistant e. cloacae. a permeability barrier in e. cloacae, c. freundii and p. aeruginosa is suggested by the potentiation of  cefbuperazone's activity by edta.

TI  == aztreonam in the treatment of bone and joint infections caused by gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == aztreonam was used successfully in 17 of 17 patients with orthopedic infections due to gram-negative bacilli (11, osteomyelitis; six, septic arthritis). duration of treatment ranged from 14 to 55 days, and the period of follow-up was four to 18 months. causative organisms included pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, enterobacter gergoviae, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, and  enterobacter aerogenes. aztreonam was well tolerated. the only definite reactions attributable to aztreonam were asymptomatic increases in serum aspartate aminotransferase (sgot) and serum alanine aminotransferase (sgpt) in four patients; none of these reactions interfered with completion of therapy. adverse  reactions that were possibly attributable to aztreonam included rash (two patients), diarrhea (one patient), and leukopenia (one patient). all of these patients were receiving antibiotics active against gram-positive organisms in mixed infections in addition to aztreonam. aztreonam is a promising new monobactam without significant toxicity. it has good activity against gram-negative aerobic bacteria, including p. aeruginosa, and is effective in the  treatment of serious infections due to gram-negative aerobes.

TI  == [clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dosage of cefmenoxime. observation on the mics and cefmenoxime disc susceptibility test].
AB  == the in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (cmx) was determined using agar dilution at  inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml against 333 clinical bacterial isolates. cmx was highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter aerogenes and haemophilus influenzae and also streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae with mic values in the range of 0.024 to 3.13 micrograms/ml. against staphylococci and serratia marcescens, cmx showed the antimicrobial activity with mic90 6.25 micrograms/ml. however, cmx was not active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter anitratus and exhibited no useful activity against streptococcus faecalis. reliability of cmx disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of the antimicrobial activity was also investigated, using 8 mm diameter disc (showa) and 6 mm diameter disc (wako), both of them containing 30 micrograms of cmx. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, capable of utilizing cmx disc susceptibility test for the estimation of proper administrative dose of cmx. using 6 mm diameter disc containing 30 micrograms cmx, fuchs et al. have proposed the following tentative zone size break points: greater than or equal to 22 mm =  mic 8 micrograms/ml, susceptible; 15 to 21 mm = mic 16 approximately 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (intermediate); and less than or equal to 14 mm = mic greater than 32 micrograms/ml, resistant. in this investigation, the  following zone size break points have preferred: greater than or equal to 25 mm = mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml (3+); 20 to 24 mm = mic greater than 3  to 15 micrograms/ml (2+); 16 to 19 mm = mic greater than 15 to 60 micrograms/ml (+) and less than or equal to 15 mm = mic greater than or equal to 60 micrograms/ml (-). based on cmx pharmacokinetic data currently available, mic break points proposed, less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml and less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml, would be useful for estimating the administrative dose of this antibiotic to obtain the effective blood level (e.g. the bacteriostatic activity in serum 1: greater than or equal to 8 for treatment of severe infection.

TI  == five cephalosporins: pharmacokinetics and their relation to antibacterial potency.
AB  == in a group of adult volunteers, pharmacokinetic profiles of five cephalosporins were correlated with their minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics90) against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter aerogenes. subjects received the following intravenous regimens in a randomized,  crossover fashion: (1) 0.5 gm, 1 gm, or 2 gm of cefazolin; (2) 2 gm of cephalothin; (3) 1 gm of cephapirin; (4) 1 gm of cefoxitin; or (5) 0.5 gm of cefamandole. the 500-mg dose of cefazolin produced serum concentrations that exceeded those of any of the other cephalosporins at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after administration. the area under the curve for this dose of cefazolin was at  least twice that of any of the other antibiotics. two hours after a 500-mg dose of cefazolin, serum levels exceeded the mic90 for all seven groups of pathogens;  at six hours, the 500-mg dose of cefazolin continued to achieve serum levels above the mic90 against the majority of bacterial groups. in contrast, at two hours after administration none of the other cephalosporins maintained serum levels above the mic90 for all pathogens; at six hours, the levels of cephapirin  were adequate to inhibit the two streptococci, but serum levels of all other cephalosporins were inadequate to inhibit any of the pathogens. these data indicate that a 500-mg dose of cefazolin maintains serum levels above the mics90  longer than any of the other cephalosporins tested and support the use of a 500-mg dose of cefazolin every eight hours for surgical prophylaxis and treatment of most community-acquired infections. such a comparatively low dosage offers substantial savings to both patient and hospital.

AB  == the activity of cefmenoxime, an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, was studied against 650 bacteria. it was slightly less active than cefotaxime and more active than moxalactam against staphylococci. it had activity similar to that of cefotaxime and ceftizoxime against group a and b streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae.  it did not inhibit streptococcus faecalis or listeria spp. cefmenoxime had activity similar to that of cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, ceftazidime, and moxalactam  against escherichia coli, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella, proteus mirabilis, salmonella, and shigella. it inhibited beta-lactamase-positive and -negative isolates at less than or equal to 0.4 microgram/ml. cefmenoxime was somewhat less active than moxalactam or ceftizoxime against enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter  aerogenes, and enterobacter agglomerans, but was more active than cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, or ceftazidime against morganella (minimum inhibitory concentration  for 90% of isolates, 0.1 microgram/ml.), proteus vulgaris and providencia spp. it was as active as ceftizoxime was against serratia. pseudomonas spp. and bacteroides spp. were relatively resistant (minimum inhibitory concentration for  90% of isolates, greater than 100 micrograms/ml). the compound was stable to the  common plasmid beta-lactamases, such as that of tem. it was stable to most chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases, which act primarily as cephalosporinases, but was hydrolyzed by bacteroides and acinetobacter.

TI  == in vitro activity of norfloxacin, a quinolinecarboxylic acid, compared with that  of beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  == norfloxacin is a quinolinecarboxylic acid compound. we examined the in vitro activity of this compound against gram-positive and -negative species, including  anaerobic species. it inhibited 90% (mic90) of strains of escherichia coli at 0.05 microgram/ml, klebsiella sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, salmonella and shigella spp. at 0.1 microgram/ml, citrobacter sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, enterobacter cloacae at 0.2 microgram/ml, enterobacter aerogenes at 0.4 microgram/ml, and enterobacter agglomerans at 0.2 microgram/ml. the mics of proteus mirabilis, morganella sp., proteus vulgaris, proteus rettgeri, and providencia sp. were 0.1, 0.2, 0.8, 0.3, and 1.6 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 of serratia sp. was 1.6 micrograms/ml, and that of acinetobacter sp. was 6.3 micrograms/ml. for pseudomonas aeruginosa the mic50, the mic75, and the mic90 were 0.8, 1.6, and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic50 of pseudomonas maltophilia was 3.1 micrograms/ml, and the mic90 was 12.5 micrograms/ml. yersinia, arizona, and aeromonas all were inhibited at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml, as was campylobacter. the activity of the compound against gram-positive species was less impressive: the mic90s of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus faecalis were 1.6, 6.3, 3.1, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. all listeria strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml. the activity of norfloxacine was not affected by the type of medium, ph, or inoculum size. there was no major difference between mic and minimum bactericidal concentration values. norfloxacin inhibited bacteria in every species which was resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim at concentrations lower than those of aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, moxalactam, and aminoglycosides.

TI  == in vitro activity of apalcillin compared with that of other new penicillins and anti-pseudomonas cephalosporins.
AB  == apalcillin, a naphthydridine derivative of ampicillin, was compared with ticarcillin, azlocillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone  against gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial isolates and with cefsulodin and tobramycin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. the minimal concentrations of apalcillin at which 50 and 90% of hospital isolates of escherichia coli were inhibited were similar to those of mezlocillin and piperacillin (1.6 and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively). apalcillin had minimal inhibitory concentrations similar to those of piperacillin against citrobacter freundii and citrobacter diversus. against klebsiella, apalcillin inhibited 50% of organisms at a concentration of 6.3 micrograms/ml, similar to piperacillin. the activity of apalcillin against enterobacter (e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, and e. agglomerans) was similar to that of mezlocillin and piperacillin and greater than that of ticarcillin. the activity of apalcillin against proteus mirabilis was similar to  that of the other agents, as was its activity against indole-positive proteus and providencia. only 40% of serratia were inhibited at an apalcillin concentration of 25 micrograms/ml. apalcillin was as active as piperacillin but twofold less active than cefoxitin or moxalactam against bacteroides fragilis. it was as active as piperacillin, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against p. aeruginosa (apalcillin inhibited 90% of organisms at a concentration of 25 mg/ml). there was an inoculum effect and a difference in the minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration with beta-lactamase strains. apalcillin was hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamase but not as well by cephalosporinases.

TI  == augmentin: laboratory studies.
AB  == clavulanic acid is a beta-lactam antibiotic which, although it has little intrinsic activity, is a potent inhibitor of bacterial beta-lactamases. when combined with amoxycillin its range of activity includes penicillinase-producing  strains of staphylococcus aureus and many of the beta-lactamase-producing strains of gram-negative bacilli. bacteria sensitive to augmentin include amoxycillin-resistant strains of haemophilus influenzae and escherichia coli, in  addition strains of klebsiella aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris and bacteroides fragilis are usually sensitive. the beta-lactamases produced by enterobacter spp, proteus morgani, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa are less susceptible to clavulanic acid and these bacteria are usually resistant  to augmentin (1).

TI  == antibacterial activity of ceftazidime (gr 20263) against routine hospital isolates and highly resistant strains of enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == ceftazidime was found to be highly active against routine hospital isolates of strains of enterobacteriaceae such as escherichia coli, klebsiella aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis, with the mean mics varying between 0.11 and 0.75 mg/l. it had marked activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa with a  mean mic of 1.8 mg/l which was comparable to tobramycin (11 mg/l) and superior to other aminoglycosides, penicillins and cefotaxime. although ceftazidime was considerably more active than cefuroxime and cefamandole against e. coli, k. aerogenes and ent. cloacae, its activity against strains with multi-antibiotic resistance and marked beta-lactamase production was much diminished, with mean mics between 5 and 21 mg/l. these results with ceftazidime suggest it will be a valuable parenteral compound in the treatment of severe bacterial infections due  to strains of the enterobacteriaceae.

AB  == the in vitro and in vivo activity of fr-31564 [sodium hydrogen 3-(n-hydroxyformamido)propylphosphate] against gram-positive and -negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria was investigated and compared with that of fosfomycin, cephalexin, carbenicillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. the in  vitro activity of fr-31564 was markedly enhanced when combined with glucose 6-phosphate or fructose 6-phosphate, but not when combined with ribose phosphate, adenosine monophosphate, or glycerol phosphate. in vitro activity of fr-31564 also was enhanced by human or horse blood, but not by human serum. the type of medium had a great effect on the minimal inhibitory concentration, with the lowest minimal inhibitory concentrations achieved on nutrient agar, 8- to 16-fold less than with mueller-hinton, heart infusion, or trypticase soy agars. fr-31564  was more active than fosfomycin, cephalexin, carbenicillin, or trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, enterobacter cloacae, e. aerogenes, and citrobacter. it was less active than fosfomycin against serratia marcescens and proteus mirabilis and did not inhibit gram-positive cocci or anaerobic species. fr-31564 inhibited a number of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and some pseudomonas aeruginosa strains resistant to the other agents. in the presence and absence of human blood fr-31564 showed bactericidal activity, and p. aeruginosa exposed to fr-31564 for  3 h showed a 6-h lag in regrowth. fr-31564 administered by the subcutaneous route was more active in protecting mice challenged with p. aeruginosa than was fosfomycin, carbenicillin, or cefoperazone. it was as active by the oral route in protecting mice challenged with e. coli as was fosfomycin, ampicillin, cephalexin, or trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole.

TI  == evaluation of the four-hour micro-id technique for direct identification of oxidase-negative, gram-negative rods from blood cultures.
AB  == a 4-h micro-id technique for direct identification of oxidase-negative gram-negative rods from positive blood cultures was compared to subculture and species identification of single colonies by api 20e and micro-id, using standardized inocula. a total of 127 patients (220 positive cultures) were studied. isolates included 96 escherichia coli, 46 klebsiella pneumoniae, 7 klebsiella oxytoca, 8 enterobacter aerogenes, 17 enterobacter cloacae, 19 serratia marcescens, 2 serratia liquefaciens, 8 proteus mirabilis, 1 salmonella species, 1 morganella morganii, 6 haemophilus influenzae, 2 haemophilus parainfluenzae, 3 bacteroides fragilis, 3 acinetobacter calcoaceticus biotype anitratus, and 1 pseudomonas maltophilia. in 90% of the cultures, identification  by micro-id was identical to that obtained after subculture; if the 15 non-enterobacterial isolates were excluded, the corresponding figure was 96.6%. enterobacteria identified incorrectly by direct micro-id were three s. marcescens (two identified as s. liquefaciens, one as hafnia alvei), two s. liquefaciens (both identified as e. cloacae), and two k. pneumoniae (one identified as klebsiella ozaenae, the other as serratia rubidaea). none of the 15 non-enterobacterial cultures were correctly identified by micro-id (non-identifiable, or classified as providencia/yersinia/klebsiella species). although biochemical discrepancies between direct and final micro-id tests occurred in 41% of the enterobacterial cultures, this did not seriously interfere with identification. direct species identification of enterobacteriaceae from blood cultures by direct micro-id is accurate and easily performed and identified organisms within 4 h compared to at least 24 h by most other methods; the direct  micro-id technique would be rendered even more valuable by the additional capability of identifying non-enterobacterial gram-negative isolates.

AB  == in this study the author reported upon a practical new system for screening and identifying the microbial agents causing urinary tract infections. this system is composed of a combination of 3 screening procedures (ph-value + nitrite-test + catalase-test) and 8 selective culture media for the purpose of genus identification within 24 hours (uripret-g). a total of 130 cultures was investigated. the employed microorganisms were mainly recovered from urine samples. they included the following species: candida albicans, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus inconstans, proteus mirabilis, proteus morganii, proteus rettgeri, proteus vulgaris, serratia liquefaciens, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis and streptococcus faecium. employing coded cultures not only monoinfections but also multiinfections in urine samples were simulated. under the circumstances of investigation it was possible with the help of the new system to reidentify the genera of all but two of the 130 employed microorganisms.

TI  == comparison of activity of sisomicin and gentamicin in mouse protection tests with gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == the efficacy of sisomicin and gentamicin was compared in mouse protection studies against strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. there was no  significant difference in mortality of the mice in any of the protocol groups when five different dosages of sisomicin and gentamicin given by three separate schedules were compared for each bacterial inoculum in each antibiotic protocol.  the mean protective dose values of sisomicin were at least one-half those of gentamicin for each protocol against pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == formation of crystalline deposits by several genera of the family enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == several species of bacteria from the family enterobacteriaceae formed crystalline materials containing calcium when grown in a defined culture medium. enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, citrobacter freundii, and c. intermedius produced calcium pyrophosphate crystals. edwardsiella tarda and escherichia coli formed calcite iii crystals, whereas proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, providencia stuartii, and serratia marcescens produced hydroxyapatite crystals. several of these bacteria have been isolated from the kidneys of patients with kidney stones, indicating that microorganisms may be involved in the enucleation  process of kidney stone formation.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of cefoxitin and cefamandole.
AB  == cefoxitin and cefamandole were evaluated in vitro against 263 organisms. studies  were performed in mueller-hinton and nutrient broth and agar employing inoculum sizes of 10(6) and 10(8) organisms per ml. at obtainable serum levels both antibiotics were bactericidal for nearly all strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella, proteus mirabilis, and staphylococcus aureus but were inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus. in agar, cefamandole appeared to be active against most strains of enterobacter and indole-positive proteus, whereas cefoxitin was active against indole-positive proteus but not enterobacter. moreover, in broth medium most strains of enterobacter were not readily inhibited by either antibiotic and only 40 and 73% of indole-positive proteus were inhibited by 10 mug of cefamandole per ml in mueller-hinton and nutrient broth, respectively. however, in both broth media, 10 mug of cefoxitin per ml continued to be inhibitory and bactericidal for most isolates of indole-positive proteus. cefoxitin also was bactericidal against four cephalothin-resistant strains of e. coli. these data suggest that cefoxitin broadens the spectrum of existing cephalosporins by enhancing the activity against indole-positive proteus species as well as some other enterobacteriaceae. on the other hand, with the exception of strains of enterobacter aerogenes, the apparent increased in vitro activity of cefamandole was demonstrated in agar and  not in broth.

TI  == susceptibilities of gram-negative bacteria to combinations of antimicrobial agents in vitro.
AB  == combinations of either clindamycin or erythromycin with gentamicin, colimycin, or carbenicillin were studied for their antimicrobial effects on clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, enterobacter aerogenes, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. no antagonistic effects of the antibiotic combinations were observed. synergistic effects of the antibiotic  combinations were noted against most strains of e. coli tested, especially when either clindamycin or erythromycin was combined with gentamicin or colimycin. of  16 other combinations of antibiotics examined with strains of e. coli as the test organisms, only the combination of penicillin g with either gentamicin or colimycin showed consistent synergy. the marked synergy of clindamycin combined with either gentamicin or colimycin was further demonstrated by following the kinetics of the bactericidal action of the antibiotic combinations and the effects on bacterial protein synthesis.

TI  == use of bile-esculin agar for rapid differentiation of enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == bile-esculin agar has been used for several years for the presumptive identification of group d streptococci. all members of the enterobacteriaceae family will also grow on this medium, but only certain ones can hydrolyze esculin to 6,7-dihydroxycoumarin, which reacts with iron to produce a characteristic blackening of the medium. one thousand and six cultures from clinical specimens representing 20 genera were isolated and identified. heavy inocula from fresh pure culture isolates on heart infusion agar were placed on bile-esculin agar slants and incubated at 35 c. the slants were examined at 4 h and again at 18 h for esculin hydrolysis. shigella, salmonella, arizona, proteus mirabilis, proteus morganii, providencia alcalifaciens, and providencia stuartii all produced negative results. klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, and serratia rubidaea produced a positive reaction in 4 h. the other  remaining eight genera exhibited varying results. the use of this medium in conjunction with triple sugar iron-lysine iron agar has been of great value in differentiating the klebsiella-enterobacter-serratia group from other enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == herd studies on coliform mastitis.
AB  == escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, and klebsiella pneumoniae were responsible for 63, 10, and 11 percent, respectively, of 158 coliform organisms recovered from mastitis cases in 8 california herds. the severity and nature of the coliform mastitis problem were found to vary greatly among herds but were characteristic for each of 4 herds studied in detail.

TI  == cefamandole, a cephalosporin antibiotic with an unusually wide spectrum of activity.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cefamandole, 7-d-mandelamido-3-(1 methyl-1h-tetrazol-5 yethiomethyl)-3-cephem-4 carboxylic acid, was investigated. the majority of streptococci and pneumococci were inhibited by 0.1 mug/ml. activity against staphylococcus aureus was below that of cephalothin, but most strains were inhibited by 0.4 mug/ml. enterococci were not inhibited by less than 25 mug/ml. cefamandole was very active against most members of the enterobacteriaceae, with  70% of escherichia coli, 86% of klebsiella pneumoniae, and 88% of proteus mirabilis inhibited by 1.6 mug/ml. a number of enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, and serratia marcescens strains were inhibited by less than 25 mug/ml.  pseudomonas species were resistant. cefamandole was more active than cephalothin, cephaloridine, or cephalexin against members of the enterobacteriaceae. inoculum  size and type of medium had variable effects on the minimal inhibitory concentration, depending upon the particular strain tested. strains of enterobacter, serratia, indole-positive proteus species showed the greatest inoculum effect. similarly, these species showed a several-fold difference of bactericidal and inhibitory levels. resistance of cefamandole to hydrolysis by gram-negative beta-lactamase played a partial role in its activity, but some strains that hydrolyzed the agent were susceptible.

TI  == butirosin, a new aminoglycosidic antibiotic complex: antibacterial activity in vitro and in mice.
AB  == butirosin is a new aminoglycosidic antibiotic complex which has broad gram-negative and gram-positive inhibitory antibacterial activity, as well as some bactericidal properties. significantly susceptible bacteria include strains  of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, and pathogenic gram-negative species such as enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae,  proteus mirabilis and p. vulgaris, salmonella enteritidis and s. typhimurium, shigella flexneri and s. sonnei. good activity by parenteral dosing was obtained  in various acute mouse infections. butirosin is especially interesting because of its activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro, including gentamicin-resistant clinical isolates, and in experimental mouse infections at relatively low doses.

TI  == changes in antibiotic sensitivity patterns of gram-negative bacilli in burns.
AB  == sensitivity tests with 12 antibiotics on 1,018 strains of gram-negative bacilli isolated in a burns unit between 1969 and 1971 showed some important differences  from results in similar tests on a series of strains isolated between 1965 and 1967. these changes included the emergence of a large proportion of kanamycin-resistant strains of klebsiella aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, and escherichia coli and of smaller proportions of trimethoprim- and gentamicin-resistant strains; also the complete replacement of proteus mirabilis  with dissociated resistance to ampicillin by strains showing linked resistance to ampicillin and carbenicillin. the probable relationship of these changes to the emergence of an r factor determining resistance to tetracycline, kanamycin, carbenicillin, ampicillin, and cephaloridine in enterobacteria and pseudomonas aeruginosa is discussed.

TI  == gram-negative bacilli in burns.
AB  == in a period of two years, 865 strains of gram-negative bacilli other than pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from burns were identified by a range of tests. the commonest species were proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, and enterobacter  cloacae. many strains of klebsiella aerogenes, enterobacter aerogenes, and bacterium anitratum were also found.a large proportion of the strains were tested for sensitivity to nalidixic acid, ampicillin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and carbenicillin, and smaller numbers of strains were tested for sensitivity to cephaloridine, polymyxin, streptomycin, sulphadiazine, sulfamylon, and trimethoprim. the proportion of strains sensitive and resistant to different  antibacterial agents varied widely with species of bacteria. a large proportion of the strains of e. coli and p. mirabilis were resistant to ampicillin, which was much used in treatment; resistance appeared least often towards nalidixic acid, kanamycin, trimethoprim, and gentamicin. multiple resistance occurred less  often among strains of e. coli than among klebsiella spp, enterobacter spp, and p. mirabilis. phage and serological typing of ps. aeruginosa showed that most infections of burns with this organism were due to strains previously found in other patients in the same ward. taken with other evidence, this supported the view that most infections with ps. aeruginosa were not acquired from the patient's own flora but from sources in the hospital environment.

TI  == polynucleotide sequence relationships among members of enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == polynucleotide relationships were examined among many representatives of the enterobacteriaceae by means of agar, membrane filter, and hydroxyapatite procedures. the amount of deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) that reassociated was dependent, especially in interspecific reactions, on the annealing temperature. in only three cases: escherichia coli-shigella flexneri, salmonella typhimurium-s. typhi, and proteus mirabilis-p. vulgaris, was relative interspecific duplex formation 80% or higher. in most cases interspecies dna duplex formation was 40% or less of that obtained from intraspecies dna reassociation reactions. the stability of e. coli-s. flexneri dna duplexes formed at either 60 or 75 c was virtually identical to that of homologous e. coli dna duplexes, and the degree of interspecies duplex formation was minimally affected  by the temperature increase (86% at 60 c; 77% at 75 c). the thermal stability of  dna duplexes formed at 60 c between dna from e. coli and dna from strains of aerobacter aerogenes, s. typhimurium, s. typhi, and p. mirabilis was about 12 to  14 c below that of reassociated e. coli dna. at 75 c, the formation of the interspecific dna duplexes was markedly decreased, but the stability of the dna able to reassociate at this temperature approximated that of reassociated e. coli dna. the degree of reassociation and the thermal stability of e. coli-s. flexneri dna duplexes suggests relatively little evolutionary divergence in these organisms. the other enterobacteria tested, however, have diverged to a point where less than one-half of their dna can reanneal with e. coli dna at 60 c and less than 10% reacts at 75 c. the degree of divergence between various enterobacteria does not appear to be uniform along the dna molecule. ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rna)-specific sequences are conserved among most enterobacteria. an examination of messenger rna relatively specific for the lactose operon suggests that specific chromosomal genes may diverge more or less  than the genome as a whole.

TI  == role of lipid in the protection of staphylococcus aureus against trichlorophenol  in mixed culture.
AB  == the sensitivities of proteus mirabilis, salmonella schottmuelleri, aerobacter aerogenes, and staphylococcus aureus to 2, 4, 6-trichlorophenol in sodium borate  were studied. it was demonstrated that these gram-negative organisms can protect  s. aureus from the effect of the phenol in mixed culture. there is a direct correlation between this protective effect and the quantity of total lipid extracted from the gram-negative organisms. the distribution coefficient between  trichlorophenol and the lipid of the cells is related to the sensitivity and capacity to protect s. aureus in mixed culture. hydrogen bonding between the cell's lipid and the phenolic compound is discussed as a possible mechanism which determines a cell's response to the inhibitor.

TI  == in vitro biological activity of cephalothin.
AB  == chang, te-wen (tufts university school of medicine, boston, mass.) and louis weinstein. in vitro biological activity of cephalothin. j. bacteriol. 85:1022-1027. 1963.-cephalothin is a "broad-spectrum" antibiotic active, in low concentrations, against diplococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus. shigella, salmonella, and proteus mirabilis were the most  sensitive of the gram-negative organisms. escherichia coli and aerobacter aerogenes were suppressed to a lesser degree, whereas pseudomonas aeruginosa and  herellea were highly resistant. penicillin-sensitive and -resistant strains of s. aureus were equally susceptible to cephalothin. exposure to increasing concentrations of the drug very frequently led to the development of resistance in gram-negative organisms; this was observed less often with s. aureus. cephalothin stimulated the production of penicillinase by staphylococci, which remained sensitive to the cephalosporanic acid derivatives despite repeated subculture in increasing concentrations of the agent. cephalothin was not inhibited by penicillinase. this antibiotic was more toxic to cultures of human amnion and mouse embryo cells than benzyl penicillin g but was less injurious than oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, and demethylchlortetracycline; tetracylcine produced about the same degree of cellular damage as cephalothin.
