TI  == assignment of fatty acid-beta-oxidizing syntrophic bacteria to syntrophomonadaceae fam. nov. on the basis of 16s rrna sequence analyses.
AB  == after enrichment from chinese rural anaerobic digestor sludge, anaerobic, sporing and nonsporing, saturated fatty acid-beta-oxidizing syntrophic bacteria were isolated as cocultures with h2- and formate-utilizing methanospirillum hungatei or desulfovibrio sp. strain g-11. the syntrophs degraded c4 to c8 saturated fatty acids, including isobutyrate and 2-methylbutyrate. they were adapted to grow on crotonate and were isolated as pure cultures. the crotonate-grown pure cultures alone did not grow on butyrate in either the presence or the absence of some common electron acceptors. however, when they were reconstituted with m. hungatei, growth on butyrate again occurred. in contrast, crotonate-grown clostridium kluyveri and clostridium sticklandii, as well as clostridium sporogenes, failed to grow on butyrate when these organisms were cocultured with  m. hungatei. the crotonate-grown pure subcultures of the syntrophs described above were subjected to 16s rrna sequence analysis. several previously documented fatty acid-beta-oxidizing syntrophs grown in pure cultures with crotonate were also subjected to comparative sequence analyses. the sequence analyses revealed that the new sporing and nonsporing isolates and other syntrophs that we sequenced, which had either gram-negative or gram-positive cell wall ultrastructure, all belonged to the phylogenetically gram-positive phylum. they were not closely related to any of the previously known subdivisions in the gram-positive phylum with which they were compared, but were closely related to each other, forming a new subdivision in the phylum. we recommend that this group be designated syntrophomonadaceae fam. nov.; a description is given.
