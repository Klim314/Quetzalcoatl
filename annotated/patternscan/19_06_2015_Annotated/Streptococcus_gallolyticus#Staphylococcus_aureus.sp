TI  == complementarity between targeted real-time specific pcr and conventional broad-range 16s rdna pcr in the syndrome-driven diagnosis of infectious diseases.
AB  == molecular tools have shown an added value in the diagnosis of infectious diseases, in particular for those caused by fastidious intracellular microorganisms, or in patients receiving antibiotics before sampling. if 16s rdna amplification had been gradually implemented in microbiology laboratories, specific real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) would have permitted an increase in the sensitivity of molecular methods and a reduction of contamination. herein, we report our experience in the diagnosis of infectious diseases over two years, during which 32,948 clinical samples from 18,056 patients were received from france and abroad. among these samples, 81,476 pcrs were performed, of which 1,192 were positive. molecular techniques detected intracellular microorganisms in 31.3 % of respiratory samples, 27.8 % of endocarditis samples and 51.9 % of adenitis samples. excluding intracellular bacteria, 25 % of the positive samples in this series were sterile in culture. conventional broad-range pcr permitted the identification of fastidious and anaerobic microorganisms, but specific real-time pcr showed a significant superiority in the diagnosis of osteoarticular infections, in particular for those caused by kingella kingae and staphylococcus aureus, and for endocarditis diagnosis, specifically when streptococcus gallolyticus and staphylococcus aureus were involved. the sensitivity of conventional broad-range pcr was 62.9 % concerning overall diagnoses for which both techniques had been performed. these  findings should lead microbiologists to focus on targeted specific real-time pcr  regarding the clinical syndrome. finally, syndrome-driven diagnosis, which consists of testing a panel of microorganisms commonly involved for each syndrome, permitted the establishment of 31 incidental diagnoses.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of daptomycin tested against gram-positive strains collected in european hospitals: results from 7 years of resistance surveillance  (2003-2009).
AB  == daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide approved by the european medicines agency (emea) for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cssti) and staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and endocarditis. we evaluated the in vitro  activity of daptomycin and comparators tested against clinical isolates from european hospitals over a 7-year period (2003-2009). a total of 36,769 consecutive isolates were collected in 34 medical centers located in 13 european  countries, turkey and israel. the collection included s. aureus (18,352; 27.2% oxacillin-resistant [mrsa]); coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons; 6,874), enterococcus spp. (7,241; 9.4% vancomycin-resistant), beta-hemolytic (3,009), viridans group streptococci (1,176), and streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus (107).  the organisms were isolated mainly from patients with bloodstream infection (56%) or cssti (23%). daptomycin was very active against s. aureus and cons (mic(50/90), 0.25/0.5 mg/l for both organisms), and its activity was not adversely influenced by oxacillin resistance. all enterococcus faecalis strains were susceptible to daptomycin (mic(50/90), 1/1 mg/l). daptomycin (mic(50/90), 2/2 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible) and linezolid (mic(50/90), 1/2 mg/l; 99.7% susceptible) were the most active agents tested against vancomycin-resistant e. faecium. vancomycin- resistant and -susceptible enterococcal strains were equally susceptible to daptomycin. daptomycin was also active against beta-hemolytic streptococci (mic(50/90), 0.06/0.25 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible), viridans group streptococci (mic(50/90), 0.25/0.5 mg/l; 99.8% susceptible) and s. bovis (mic(50/90), 0.06/0.12 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible).in summary, daptomycin was very  potent against this large collection (36,769) of gram-positive organisms isolated in european hospitals, and its activity remained stable across the 7-year period  evaluated (2003-2009), using reference methods and interpretive criteria. decreases in daptomycin potency were not observed since emea approval and widespread clinical use, and emerging resistance to other compounds did not adversely influence daptomycin activity against contemporary gram-positive species.

TI  == mode of action and in vitro susceptibility of mastitis pathogens to macedocin st91km and preparation of a teat seal containing the bacteriocin.
AB  == mastitis is considered to be the most economically costly disease affecting the dairy industry. regular dosage of animals with antibiotics, including use of prophylactic concentrations, may select for resistant strains. the purpose of this study was to determine the mode of action of a new bacteriocin (macedocin st91km), to evaluate the antimicrobial resistance of mastitis pathogens to antibiotics commonly used in treatment remedies, and to introduce the possible use of an alternative antimicrobial agent. the bacteriocin macedocin st91km, produced by streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus st91km, is bactericidal to streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis and staphylococcus aureus associated with mastitis infections, including strains resistant to methicillin and oxacillin. sensitive cells were deformed and secreted nucleotides, k(+) and beta-galactosidase when exposed to macedocin st91km. adsorption of the peptide to target cells decreased in the presence of solvents, suggesting that receptors on the cell surfaces have lipid moieties. no  adsorption was recorded in the presence of mgcl2, ki and na2co3, suggesting that  ionic strength plays an important role. a teat seal preparation containing macedocin st91km effectively released the peptide and inhibited the growth of s.  agalactiae. macedocin st91km could form the basis for alternative dry cow therapy to prevent mastitis infections in dairy cows as it is effective against pathogens that display resistance to conventional antibiotic therapy.

TI  == bacteriocin st91km, produced by streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus st91km, is a narrow-spectrum peptide active against bacteria associated with mastitis in dairy cattle.
AB  == streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus st91km produces a bacteriocin (macedocin st91km) active against streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. macedocin st91km is, according to tricine-sds page, between 2.0 and 2.5 kda in size. antimicrobial activity remained unchanged  after 2 h of incubation at ph 2.0-10.0 and after 100 min at 100 degrees c. the peptide was inactivated after 20 min at 121 degrees c and when treated with proteolytic enzymes. treatment with alpha-amylase had no effect on activity, suggesting that the mode of action does not depend on glycosylation. amplification of the genome of strain st91km with primers designed from the macedocin precursor gene (mcda) produced 2 fragments (approximately 375 and 220 bp) instead of one 150-bp fragment, as recorded for macedocin produced by streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus aca-dc 198. strain aca-dc 198 was not available. however, dna amplified from strain lmg 18488 (aca-dc 206), genetically closely related to strain aca-dc 198, revealed 99% homology to the mcda of strain aca-dc 198 (accession no. dq835394). macedocin st91km may thus be  a second putative bacteriocin described for streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus.
