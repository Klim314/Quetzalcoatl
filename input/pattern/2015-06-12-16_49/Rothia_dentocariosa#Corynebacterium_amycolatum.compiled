TI  - Coryneform bacteria in throat cultures of healthy individuals.
AB  - Throat swabs from 113 healthy individuals from Hamburg, Germany, and Zurich, Switzerland, were investigated for coryneform bacteria with nonselective and selective media. Ninety specimens contained 123 strains. Surprisingly, 76% of them were strains of Corynebacterium durum (47%) and Rothia dentocariosa (29%). Only two were strains of Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum, and none were strains of C. striatum, C. amycolatum, or C. diphtheriae.
