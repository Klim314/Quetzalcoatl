TI  == antimicrobial impacts of essential oils on food borne-pathogens.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of twelve essential oil (pine oil, eucalyptus, thyme,  sage tea, lavender, orange, laurel, lemon, myrtle, lemon, rosemary and juniper) was tested by a disc diffusion method against food borne pathogens (escherichia coli, salmonella paratyphi a, klebsiella pneumoniae, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, aeromonas hydrophila, campylobacter jejuni, enterococcus  faecalis, staphylococcus aureus). the major components in essential oils were monoterpenes hydrocarbons, alpha-pinene, limonene; monoterpene phenol, carvacrol  and oxygenated monoterpenes, camphor, 1,8-cineole, eucalyptol, linalool and linalyl acetate. although the antimicrobial effect of essential oils varied depending on the chemical composition of the essential oils and specific microorganism tested, majority of the oils exhibited antibacterial activity against one or more strains. the essential oil with the lowest inhibition zones was juniper with the values varied from 1.5 to 6 mm. however, the components of essential oil of thyme and pine oil are highly active against food borne pathogen, generating the largest inhibition zones for both gram negative and positive bacteria (5.25-28.25 mm vs. 12.5-30 mm inhibition zones). these results  indicate the possibility use of the essential oils on food system as antimicrobial agents against food-borne pathogen. the article also offers some promising patents on applications of essential oils on food industry as antimicrobial agent.

TI  == molecular survey of occurrence and quantity of legionella spp., mycobacterium spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and amoeba hosts in municipal drinking water storage tank sediments.
AB  == aims: to examine the occurrence and quantity of potential pathogens and an indicator of microbial contamination in the sediments of municipal drinking water storage tanks (mdwsts), given the absence of such data across the united states.  methods and results: sediment samples (87 mdwst) from eighteen locations across ten states of the united states were collected and assayed by qpcr for a range of potential enteric and opportunistic microbial pathogens and a sewage-associated bacteroides marker. potential opportunistic pathogens dominated, with the highest detection of occurrence (per cent positive detection; average cell equivalence (ce)) being mycobacterium spp. (88.9%; 6.7 +/- 8.5 x 104 ce g-1 ), followed by legionella spp. (66.7%; 5.2 +/- 5.9 x 103 ce g-1 ), pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.2%; 250 +/- 880 ce g-1 ) and acanthamoeba spp. (38.9%; 53 +/- 70 ce g-1 ), with no detected naegleria fowleri. most enteric pathogens (campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli 0157:h7, salmonella enterica, cryptosporidium parvum and giardia duodenalis) were not detected, except for a trace signal for campylobacter spp. there was significant correlation between the qpcr signals of legionella spp. and acanthamoeba spp. (r2 = 0.61, n = 87, p = 0.0001). diverse legionella spp. including leg. pneumophila, leg. pneumophila sg1 and leg. anisa were identified,  each of which might cause legionellosis. conclusions: these results imply that potential opportunistic pathogens are common within mdwst sediments and could act as a source of microbial contamination, but need downstream growth to be of potential concern. significance and impact of the study: the results imply that opportunistic pathogen risks may need to be managed by regular tank cleaning or other management practices.

TI  == molecular-based approaches to characterize coastal microbial community and their  potential relation to the trophic state of red sea.
AB  == molecular-based approaches were used to characterize the coastal microbiota and to elucidate the trophic state of red sea. nutrient content and enterococci numbers were monitored, and used to correlate with the abundance of microbial markers. microbial source tracking revealed the presence of >1 human-associated bacteroides spp. at some of the near-shore sampling sites and at a heavily frequented beach. water samples collected from the beaches had occasional exceedances in enterococci numbers, higher total organic carbon (toc, 1.48-2.18 mg/l) and nitrogen (tn, 0.15-0.27 mg/l) than that detected in the near-shore waters. enterococci abundances obtained from next-generation sequencing did not correlate well with the cultured enterococci numbers. the abundance of certain genera, for example arcobacter, pseudomonas and unclassified campylobacterales, was observed to exhibit slight correlation with toc and tn. low abundance of functional genes accounting for up to 41 copies/l of each pseudomonas aeruginosa  and campylobacter coli were detected. arcobacter butzleri was also detected in abundance ranging from 111 to 238 copies/l. operational taxonomic units (otus) associated with cyanobacteria, prochlorococcus, ostreococcus spp. and gramella were more prevalent in waters that were likely impacted by urban runoffs and recreational activities. these otus could potentially serve as quantifiable markers indicative of the water quality.

TI  == vaccines for viral and bacterial pathogens causing acute gastroenteritis: part ii: vaccines for shigella, salmonella, enterotoxigenic e. coli (etec) enterohemorragic e. coli (ehec) and campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == in part ii we discuss the following bacterial pathogens: shigella, salmonella (non-typhoidal), diarrheogenic e. coli (enterotoxigenic and enterohemorragic) and campylobacter jejuni. in contrast to the enteric viruses and vibrio cholerae discussed in part i of this series, for the bacterial pathogens described here there is only one licensed vaccine, developed primarily for vibrio cholerae and which provides moderate protection against enterotoxigenic e. coli (etec) (dukoral((r))), as well as a few additional candidates in advanced stages of development for etec and one candidate for shigella spp. numerous vaccine candidates in earlier stages of development are discussed.

TI  == in vivo production of a novel glycoconjugate vaccine against shigella flexneri 2a in recombinant escherichia coli: identification of stimulating factors for in vivo glycosylation.
AB  == background: glycoconjugated vaccines composed of polysaccharide antigens covalently linked to immunogenic carrier proteins have proved to belong to the most effective and safest vaccines for combating bacterial pathogens. the functional transfer of the n-glycosylation machinery from campylobacter jejuni to the standard prokaryotic host escherichia coli established a novel bioconjugation methodology termed bacterial glycoengineering. results: in this study, we report  on the production of a new recombinant glycoconjugate vaccine against shigella flexneri 2a representing the major serotype for global outbreaks of shigellosis.  we demonstrate that s. flexneri 2a o-polysaccharides can be transferred to a detoxified variant of pseudomonas aeruginosa carrier protein exotoxin a (epa) by  the c. jejuni oligosaccharyltransferase pglb, resulting in glycosylated epa-2a. moreover, we optimized the in vivo production of this novel vaccine by identification and quantitative analysis of critical process parameters for glycoprotein synthesis. it was found that sequential induction of oligosaccharyltransferase pglb and carrier protein epa increased the specific productivity of epa-2a by a factor of 1.6. furthermore, by the addition of 10 g/l of the monosaccharide n-acetylglucosamine during induction, glycoconjugate vaccine yield was boosted up to 3.1-fold. the optimum concentration of mg2+ ions  for n-glycan transfer was determined to be 10 mm. finally, optimized parameters were transferred to high cell density cultures with a 46-fold increase of overall yield of glycoconjugate compared to the one in initial shake flask production. conclusion: the present study is the first attempt to identify stimulating parameters for improved productivity of s. flexneri 2a bioconjugates. optimization of glycosylation efficiency will ultimately foster the transfer of lab-scale expression to a cost-effective in vivo production process for a glycoconjugate vaccine against s. flexneri 2a in e. coli. this study is an important step towards this goal and provides a starting point for further optimization studies.

TI  == bacterial flagella: twist and stick, or dodge across the kingdoms.
AB  == the flagellum organelle is an intricate multiprotein assembly best known for its  rotational propulsion of bacteria. however, recent studies have expanded our knowledge of other functions in pathogenic contexts, particularly adherence and immune modulation, e.g., for salmonella enterica, campylobacter jejuni, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and escherichia coli. flagella-mediated adherence is important in host colonisation for several plant and animal pathogens, but the specific interactions that promote flagella binding to such diverse host tissues  has remained elusive. recent work has shown that the organelles act like probes that find favourable surface topologies to initiate binding. an emerging theme is that more general properties, such as ionic charge of repetitive binding epitopes and rotational force, allow interactions with plasma membrane components. at the  same time, flagellin monomers are important inducers of plant and animal innate immunity: variation in their recognition impacts the course and outcome of infections in hosts from both kingdoms. bacteria have evolved different strategies to evade or even promote this specific recognition, with some important differences shown for phytopathogens. these studies have provided a wider appreciation of the functions of bacterial flagella in the context of both  plant and animal reservoirs.

TI  == detection of salmonella spp. by a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp) method targeting bcfd gene.
AB  == in this study, we developed and validated a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp) assay for salmonella detection targeting bcfd gene, a conserved fimbrial operon gene existing in salmonella. the salmonella lamp assay  we developed successfully amplified 44 salmonella strains (14 standard strains and 30 clinical isolates), but none of 9 non-salmonella standard strains (proteus mirabilis, listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, shigella flexneri, shigella sonnei, klebsiella pneumoniae, campylobacter jejuni and vibrio parahemolyticus). the detection limit was 5 cfu of salmonella pure culture or 200 cfu of artificially spiked faeces per reaction system (equivalent  to 5000 cfu g(-1) of faeces), and this method could directly detect salmonella in chicken faeces free of pre-enrichment in a reaction time of 25 min. our experiments show that the lamp method we developed is a rapid, sensitive, specific and practical method for salmonella detection. the salmonella lamp assay can potentially serve as new on-site diagnostics in the food and agricultural industries. significance and impact of the study: a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp) assay was established to detect salmonella targeting bcfd gene, a conserved fimbrial operon gene. the detection limit was 5 cfu of salmonella pure culture or 200 cfu of artificially spiked faeces per reaction system (equivalent to 5000 cfu g(-1) of faeces), and this method could directly detect salmonella in chicken faeces free of pre-enrichment in a reaction time of  25 min. the salmonella lamp assay is a rapid, sensitive, specific and practical method for salmonella detection and can potentially serve as new on-site diagnostics in the food and agricultural industries.

TI  == development of 23 individual taqman(r) real-time pcr assays for identifying common foodborne pathogens using a single set of amplification conditions.
AB  == most of the acute intestinal diseases are caused by foodborne pathogens with infants and elderly people being at major risk. the aim of this study was to develop a procedure to simultaneously detect 20 foodborne pathogens in complex alimentary matrices such as milk, cheese and meat. the list of targets include, among the others, listeria spp., salmonella spp., shigella spp., escherichia coli spp., campylobacter spp., clostridium spp. and staphylococcus aureus. the accuracy of detection was determined by using atcc strains as positive and negative controls. the achieved sensitivity of each of assays was 1 pg of genomic dna, which was equivalent to approximately 1 cfu. the working ranges of the taqman((r)) real-time pcr assays, when used quantitatively on cheese and meat samples inoculated with serial dilution of listeria spp., listeria monocytogenes, s. aureus, salmonella enterica, shigella boydii, e. coli o157:h7, bacillus cereus, campylobacter coli, yersinia enterocolitica, enterobacter sakazakii and pseudomonas aeruginosa was 10(8) cfu/g to 10(4) cfu/g. no matrix interferences were observed.

TI  == prevention of staphylococcus aureus infections by glycoprotein vaccines synthesized in escherichia coli.
AB  == background: staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of superficial and invasive  human disease that is often refractory to antimicrobial therapy. vaccines have the potential to reduce the morbidity, mortality, and economic impact associated  with staphylococcal infections. however, single-component vaccines targeting s. aureus have failed to show efficacy in clinical trials. methods: a novel glycoengineering technology for creation of a multicomponent staphylococcal vaccine is described. genes encoding s. aureus capsular polysaccharide (cp) biosynthesis, pglb (a campylobacter oligosaccharyl transferase), and a protein carrier (detoxified pseudomonas aeruginosa exoprotein a or s. aureus alpha toxin  [hla]) were coexpressed in escherichia coli. recombinant proteins n-glycosylated  with s. aureus serotype 5 or 8 cps were purified from e. coli. results: rabbits and mice immunized with the glycoprotein vaccines produced antibodies that were active in vitro in functional assays. active and passive immunization strategies  targeting the cps protected mice against bacteremia, and vaccines targeting hla protected against lethal pneumonia. the cp-hla bioconjugate vaccine protected against both bacteremia and lethal pneumonia, providing broad-spectrum efficacy against staphylococcal invasive disease. conclusions: glycoengineering technology, whereby polysaccharide and protein antigens are enzymatically linked  in a simple e. coli production system, has broad applicability for use in vaccine development against encapsulated microbial pathogens.

TI  == bioengineered 2'-fucosyllactose and 3-fucosyllactose inhibit the adhesion of pseudomonas aeruginosa and enteric pathogens to human intestinal and respiratory  cell lines.
AB  == human milk oligosaccharides help to prevent infectious diseases in breastfed infants. larger scale testing, particularly in animal models and human clinical studies, is still limited due to shortened availability of more complex oligosaccharides. the purpose of this study was to evaluate 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-fl) and 3-fucosyllactose (3-fl) synthesized by whole-cell biocatalysis for their biological activity in vitro. therefore, we have tested these oligosaccharides for their inhibitory potential of pathogen adhesion in two different human epithelial cell lines. 2'-fl could inhibit adhesion of campylobacter jejuni, enteropathogenic escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar fyris, and pseudomonas aeruginosa to the intestinal human cell line caco-2 (reduction of 26%, 18%, 12%, and 17%, respectively), as could be shown for 3-fl (enteropathogenic e coli 29%, p aeruginosa 26%). furthermore, adherence of p aeruginosa to the human respiratory epithelial cell line a549 was significantly inhibited by 2'-fl and 3-fl (reduction of 24% and 23%, respectively). these results confirm the biological and functional activity of biotechnologically synthesized human milk oligosaccharides. mass-tailored human milk oligosaccharides could be used in the future to supplement infant formula ingredients or as preventatives to reduce the impact of infectious diseases.

TI  == alternative substrates selective for s-adenosylmethionine synthetases from pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == s-adenosyl-l-methionine (adomet) synthetase catalyzes the production of adomet, the major biological methyl donor and source of methylene, amino, ribosyl, and aminopropyl groups in the metabolism of all known organism. in addition to these  essential functions, adomet can also serve as the precursor for two different families of quorum sensing molecules that trigger virulence in gram-negative human pathogenic bacteria. the enzyme responsible for adomet biosynthesis has been cloned, expressed and purified from several of these infectious bacteria. adomet synthetase (mat) from neisseria meningitidis shows similar kinetic parameters to the previously characterized escherichia coli enzyme, while the pseudomonas aeruginosa enzyme has a decreased catalytic efficiency for its mgatp  substrate. in contrast, the more distantly related mat from campylobacter jejuni  has an altered quaternary structure and possesses a higher catalytic turnover than the more closely related family members. methionine analogs have been examined to delineate the substrate specificity of these enzyme forms, and several alternative substrates have been identified with the potential to block quorum sensing while still serving as precursors for essential methyl donation and radical generation reactions.

TI  == exploitation of bacterial n-linked glycosylation to develop a novel recombinant glycoconjugate vaccine against francisella tularensis.
AB  == glycoconjugate-based vaccines have proved to be effective at producing long-lasting protection against numerous pathogens. here, we describe the application of bacterial protein glycan coupling technology (pgct) to generate a  novel recombinant glycoconjugate vaccine. we demonstrate the conjugation of the francisella tularensis o-antigen to the pseudomonas aeruginosa carrier protein exotoxin a using the campylobacter jejuni pglb oligosaccharyltransferase. the resultant recombinant f. tularensis glycoconjugate vaccine is expressed in escherichia coli where yields of 3 mg l(-1) of culture were routinely produced in a single-step purification process. vaccination of balb/c mice with the purified  glycoconjugate boosted igg levels and significantly increased the time to death upon subsequent challenge with f. tularensis subsp. holarctica. pgct allows different polysaccharide and protein combinations to be produced recombinantly and could be easily applicable for the production of diverse glycoconjugate vaccines.

TI  == computationally identifying virulence factors based on kegg pathways.
AB  == virulence factors are molecules that play very important roles in enhancing the pathogen's capability in causing diseases. many efforts were made to investigate  the mechanism of virulence factors using in silico methods. in this study, we present a novel computational method to predict virulence factors by integrating  protein-protein interactions in a string database and biological pathways in the  kegg. three specific species were studied according to their records in the vfdb. they are campylobacter jejuni nctc 11168, escherichia coli o6 : k15 : h31 536 (upec) and pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1. the prediction accuracies reached were 0.9467, 0.9575 and 0.9180, respectively. metabolism pathways, flagellar assembly  and chemotaxis may be of importance for virulence based on the analysis of the optimal feature sets we obtained. we hope this can provide some insight and guidance for related research.

TI  == rapid detection and respirometric profiling of aerobic bacteria on panels of selective media.
AB  == aims: to evaluate high-throughput optical oxygen microrespirometry for selective  detection and predictive identification of aerobic bacteria. methods and results: using greenlight probe, standard 384-well plates and time-resolved fluorescence reader, a representative panel of 16 partially selective media and 9 aerobic bacteria (escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, campylobacter jejuni, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pyogenes,  salmonella typhimurium and listeria innocua) were analysed. for each medium, bacterial strain and dilution, growth profiles were recorded, from which calibrations, doubling/generation times and growth patterns in different media were determined. analytical performance, selectivity and general usability of the method were assessed, and mixed bacterial cultures were analysed. conclusion: the microrespirometry platform facilitates simple, real-time detection and predictive identification of aerobic bacteria by looking at the patterns of their growth and respiration in several media and determining their growth and doubling times. significance and impact of the study: the new screening method can be used for routine microbiological analysis and testing of aerobic bacterial cultures as well as complex food, environmental and clinical samples.

TI  == structural insights from random mutagenesis of campylobacter jejuni oligosaccharyltransferase pglb.
AB  == background: protein glycosylation is of fundamental importance in many biological systems. the discovery of n-glycosylation in bacteria and the functional expression of the n-oligosaccharyltransferase pglb of campylobacter jejuni in escherichia coli enabled the production of engineered glycoproteins and the study of the underlying molecular mechanisms. a particularly promising application for  protein glycosylation in recombinant bacteria is the production of potent conjugate vaccines where polysaccharide antigens of pathogenic bacteria are covalently bound to immunogenic carrier proteins. results: in this study capsular polysaccharides of the clinically relevant pathogen staphylococcus aureus serotype 5 (cp5) were expressed in escherichia coli and linked in vivo to a detoxified version of pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin (epa). we investigated which amino acids of the periplasmic domain of pglb are crucial for the glycosylation reaction using a newly established 96-well screening system enabling the relative quantification of glycoproteins by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. a random mutant library was generated by error-prone pcr and screened for inactivating amino acid substitutions. in addition to 15 inactive variants with amino acid changes within the previously known, strictly conserved  wwdyg motif of n-oligosaccharyltransferases, 8 inactivating mutations mapped to a flexible loop in close vicinity of the amide nitrogen atom of the acceptor asparagine as revealed in the crystal structure of the homologous enzyme c. lari  pglb. the importance of the conserved loop residue h479 for glycosylation was confirmed by site directed mutagenesis, while a change to alanine of the adjacent, non-conserved l480 had no effect. in addition, we investigated functional requirements in the so-called miv motif of bacterial n-oligosaccharyltransferases. amino acid residues i571 and v575, which had been postulated to interact with the acceptor peptide, were subjected to cassette saturation mutagenesis. with the exception of i571c only hydrophobic residues were found in active variants. variant i571v performed equally well as the wild type, cysteine at the same position reduced glycoprotein yield slightly, while a  change to phenylalanine reduced activity by a factor of three. conclusions: this  study provides novel structure-function relationships for the periplasmic domain  of the campylobacter jejuni n-oligosaccharyltransferase pglb and describes procedures for generating and screening oligosaccharyltransferase mutant libraries in an engineered e. coli system.

TI  == diversity and impact of prokaryotic toxins on aquatic environments: a review.
AB  == microorganisms are ubiquitous in all habitats and are recognized by their metabolic versatility and ability to produce many bioactive compounds, including  toxins. some of the most common toxins present in water are produced by several cyanobacterial species. as a result, their blooms create major threats to animal  and human health, tourism, recreation and aquaculture. quite a few cyanobacterial toxins have been described, including hepatotoxins, neurotoxins, cytotoxins and dermatotoxins. these toxins are secondary metabolites, presenting a vast diversity of structures and variants. most of cyanobacterial secondary metabolites are peptides or have peptidic substructures and are assumed to be synthesized by non-ribosomal peptide synthesis (nrps), involving peptide synthetases, or nrps/pks, involving peptide synthetases and polyketide synthases  hybrid pathways. besides cyanobacteria, other bacteria associated with aquatic environments are recognized as significant toxin producers, representing important issues in food safety, public health, and human and animal well being.  vibrio species are one of the most representative groups of aquatic toxin producers, commonly associated with seafood-born infections. some enterotoxins and hemolysins have been identified as fundamental for v. cholerae and v. vulnificus pathogenesis, but there is evidence for the existence of other potential toxins. campylobacter spp. and escherichia coli are also water contaminants and are able to produce important toxins after infecting their hosts. other bacteria associated with aquatic environments are emerging as toxin  producers, namely legionella pneumophila and aeromonas hydrophila, described as responsible for the synthesis of several exotoxins, enterotoxins and cytotoxins.  furthermore, several clostridium species can produce potent neurotoxins. although not considered aquatic microorganisms, they are ubiquitous in the environment and can easily contaminate drinking and irrigation water. clostridium members are also spore-forming bacteria and can persist in hostile environmental conditions for long periods of time, contributing to their hazard grade. similarly, pseudomonas species are widespread in the environment. since p. aeruginosa is an  emergent opportunistic pathogen, its toxins may represent new hazards for humans  and animals. this review presents an overview of the diversity of toxins produced by prokaryotic microorganisms associated with aquatic habitats and their impact on environment, life and health of humans and other animals. moreover, important  issues like the availability of these toxins in the environment, contamination sources and pathways, genes involved in their biosynthesis and molecular mechanisms of some representative toxins are also discussed.

TI  == physical, chemical and microbiological quality of ice used to cool drinks and foods in greece and its public health implications.
AB  == ice used for direct human consumption or to preserve foods and cool down drinks can be contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms and may potentially become a vehicle for consumer's infection. to evaluate physical, chemical and microbiological quality of commercial ice and ice used for fish and seafood, 100  ice samples collected at 10 different retail points in the region of epirus were  studied. the following microbiological parameters were determined: total coliforms, fecal coliforms, salmonella spp., shigella spp., yersinia spp., escherichia coli, campylobacter sp., vibrio cholerae, aeromonas spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and clostridium perfringens. e. coli was detected in 22% and coliforms were detected in 31% of samples. samples in which coliforms were detected fail to meet the microbiological criteria specified by the drinking water legislation. aeromonas spp., shigella spp., campylobacter sp. and v. cholerae were not detected. spore forms of c. perfringens were prevalent at 35% and the psychotropic bacterium's p. aeruginosa and yersinia spp. were found only at three samples each. the presence of large numbers of coliforms as well as of other pathogenic strains suggested that commercial ice and ice used to make cool drinks or in preservation of fish and seafood may represent a potential hazard to the consumer. in view of the results reported herein, it is highly recommended that national regulatory guidelines should be established for the production of ice as long as regular inspections.

TI  == biofilms in drinking water and their role as reservoir for pathogens.
AB  == most microorganisms on earth live in various aggregates which are generally termed "biofilms". they are ubiquitous and represent the most successful form of  life. they are the active agent in biofiltration and the carriers of the self-cleaning potential in soils, sediments and water. they are also common on surfaces in technical systems where they sometimes cause biofouling. in recent years it has become evident that biofilms in drinking water distribution networks can become transient or long-term habitats for hygienically relevant microorganisms. important categories of these organisms include faecal indicator  bacteria (e.g., escherichia coli), obligate bacterial pathogens of faecal origin  (e.g., campylobacter spp.) opportunistic bacteria of environmental origin (e.g.,  legionella spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa), enteric viruses (e.g., adenoviruses, rotaviruses, noroviruses) and parasitic protozoa (e.g., cryptosporidium parvum).  these organisms can attach to preexisting biofilms, where they become integrated  and survive for days to weeks or even longer, depending on the biology and ecology of the organism and the environmental conditions. there are indications that at least a part of the biofilm populations of pathogenic bacteria persists in a viable but non-culturable (vbnc) state and remains unnoticed by the methods  appointed to their detection. thus, biofilms in drinking water systems can serve  as an environmental reservoir for pathogenic microorganisms and represent a potential source of water contamination, resulting in a potential health risk for humans if left unnoticed.

TI  == evaluation of low-copy genetic targets for waterborne bacterial pathogen detection via qpcr.
AB  == recent developments in water quality research have highlighted difficulties in accurately predicting the incidence of pathogens within freshwater based on the viability, culturability and metabolic activity of indicator organisms. qpcr-driven assays are candidates to replace standard culture-based methods, however, protocols suitable for routine use have yet to be sufficiently validated. the objective of this study was to evaluate five oligonucleotide primers sets (etir, sinv, exot, vs1 and ipah2) for their potential applicability  in qpcr assays to detect contamination from five waterborne bacterial pathogens (escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, campylobacter jejuni, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and shigella flexneri). an enrichment-free qpcr protocol  was also tested using s. typhimurium-seeded source water, combining membrane filtration and mechanical, chemical and enzymatic lysis techniques to recover the bacterial cells. all five primer sets were found to have high specificity and sensitivity for the tested organisms. four of the primers were able to detect pathogen loads as low as 10 cells/ml while 200 cells/ml of c. jejuni were detectable in pure culture. although sensitivity decreased in an artificially contaminated environmental matrix, it was still possible to detect as few as 10 s. typhimurium cells without enrichment. the primers and protocols evaluated in this study have demonstrated potential for further validation for possible application alongside traditional indicator techniques.

AB  == the inactivation and sublethal injury of escherichia coli o157:h7, campylobacter  jejuni and pseudomonas aeruginosa at three temperatures (22 degrees c, 4 degrees  c and -18 degrees c) were studied using traditional microbiological tests and mid-infrared spectroscopy (4000-400 cm(-1)). bacteria were cultivated in diluted  nutrient matrices with a high initial inoculation ( approximately 10(7) cfu/ml) levels. both e. coli o157:h7 and p. aeruginosa survived and cell numbers increased at 22 degrees c for 5 days while c. jejuni numbers decreased one log(10) cfu/ml. a two log cfu/ml decrease was observed for the three pathogens held at 4 degrees c for 12 days. c. jejuni survived poorly following incubation at -18 degrees c for 20 days while levels of e. coli o157:h7 and p. aeruginosa remained high (10(4) cfu/ml). temperature stress response of microbes was observed by infrared spectroscopy in polysaccharide, protein, lipid, and nucleic  acid regions and was strain specific. level of cold injury could be predicted using cluster, discriminant function and class analog analysis models. pathogens  may produce oligosaccharides and potentially other components in response to stress as indicated by changes in spectral features at 1200-900 cm(-1) following  freezing.

TI  == diarrheagenic escherichia coli in acute gastroenteritis in infants in north-west  italy.
AB  == enteropathogenic escherichia coli may cause diarrhoea in infancy, but it is not routinely detected and regarded as a major causative agent. the aim of the present study was to estimate the incidence of enteropathogenic e. coli infection and to investigate its epidemiology and pathogenesis from faecal specimens in infants hospitalized for acute gastroenteritis. between march 2008 and june 2009, faecal samples were collected and examined to recognize diarrhoeal aetiology, especially for e. coli, by cultural identification and multiplex-pcr. e. coli were isolated in 75 of 160 collected samples (46,88%); 10 samples of which (6,3%) had been positively recognised for pathogenic genes. data showed that the presence of diarrheagenic e. coli infection was 6.3%, but it becomes 5% considering e. coli as a unique agent responsible for diarrhoea. the datum is not statistically meaningful because of the small sample (p>0,05). bacterial pathogens were also isolated in 60 samples (37,5% of the total collected samples): 15 salmonella spp., 8 klebsiella pneumoniae, 9 klebsiella oxytoca, 11 citrobacter freundii, 5 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 2 serratia spp., 7 enterobacter cloacae, 1 shigella spp., 2 campylobacter spp. rotavirus was the predominant pathogenic single etiologic agent identified. it was found in 35 samples (21.88%  of the overall collected samples), while adenovirus, serotypes 40 or 41, was isolated in 2 samples (1.3%). rotavirus infection was found predominantly in winter with respect to autumn. data provide an interesting epidemiologic survey of enteropathogenic e. coli, which is not usually detected, although it may have  potential clinical implications. abbreviations: cdec, detaching e. coli; daec, diffusely adherent e. coli; eaggec, enteroaggregative e. coli; ehec, enterohaemorrhagic e. coli; eiec, enteroinvasive e. coli; epec, enteropathogenic  e. coli; etec, enterotoxigenic e. coli.

TI  == production of glycoprotein vaccines in escherichia coli.
AB  == background: conjugate vaccines in which polysaccharide antigens are covalently linked to carrier proteins belong to the most effective and safest vaccines against bacterial pathogens. state-of-the art production of conjugate vaccines using chemical methods is a laborious, multi-step process. in vivo enzymatic coupling using the general glycosylation pathway of campylobacter jejuni in recombinant escherichia coli has been suggested as a simpler method for producing conjugate vaccines. in this study we describe the in vivo biosynthesis of two novel conjugate vaccine candidates against shigella dysenteriae type 1, an important bacterial pathogen causing severe gastro-intestinal disease states mainly in developing countries. results: two different periplasmic carrier proteins, acra from c. jejuni and a toxoid form of pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin were glycosylated with shigella o antigens in e. coli. starting from shake flask cultivation in standard complex medium a lab-scale fed-batch process  was developed for glycoconjugate production. it was found that efficiency of glycosylation but not carrier protein expression was highly susceptible to the physiological state at induction. after induction glycoconjugates generally appeared later than unglycosylated carrier protein, suggesting that glycosylation was the rate-limiting step for synthesis of conjugate vaccines in e. coli. glycoconjugate synthesis, in particular expression of oligosaccharyltransferase pglb, strongly inhibited growth of e. coli cells after induction, making it necessary to separate biomass growth and recombinant protein expression phases. with a simple pulse and linear feed strategy and the use of semi-defined glycerol medium, volumetric glycoconjugate yield was increased 30 to 50-fold. conclusions: the presented data demonstrate that glycosylated proteins can be produced in recombinant e. coli at a larger scale. the described methodologies constitute an  important step towards cost-effective in vivo production of conjugate vaccines, which in future may be used for combating severe infectious diseases, particularly in developing countries.

TI  == helicobacter pylori apo-fur regulation appears unconserved across species.
AB  == the ferric uptake regulator (fur) is a transcriptional regulator that is conserved across a broad number of bacterial species and has been shown to regulate expression of iron uptake and storage genes. additionally, fur has been  shown to be an important colonization factor of the gastric pathogen helicobacter pylori. in h. pylori, fur-dependent regulation appears to be unique in that fur is able to act as a transcriptional repressor when bound to iron as well as in its iron free (apo) form. to date, apo-regulation has not been identified in any  other bacterium. to determine whether fur from other species has the capacity for apo-regulation, we investigated the ability of fur from escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, desulfovibrio vulgaris hildenborough, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vibrio cholerae to complement both iron-bound and apo-fur regulation within the context of a h. pylori fur mutant. we found that while some fur species (e. coli, c. jejuni, and v. cholerae) complemented iron-bound regulation, apo-regulation was unable to be complemented by any of the examined species. these data suggest that despite the conservation among bacterial fur proteins, h. pylori fur contains unique structure/function features that make it  novel in comparison to fur from other species.

TI  == culture-independent techniques applied to food industry water surveillance--a case study.
AB  == culture-independent techniques were used for the detection of pathogenic bacteria in drinking water at potentially critical control points along the production lines at a german dairy company and a spanish dry cured ham company. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) was used to describe bacterial population shifts indicating biological instability in the drinking water samples. autochthonous bacteria were identified by sequencing the excised dgge dna bands.  more specifically, real-time pcr was applied to detect a number of pathogenic bacteria, i.e. listeria monocytogenes, mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis, campylobacter jejuni, enterococcus spp., salmonella spp, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. due to the detection limits of the  real-time pcr method, a specific protocol was established in order to meet the technical detection requirements and to avoid unwanted polymerase inhibitions. autochthonous bacterial populations were found to be highly stable at most of the sampling points. only one sampling point exhibited population shifts at the german dairy company. enterococci and p.aeruginosa were detected in some water samples from these companies by molecular biology detection methods, but not by conventional culturing methods. some opportunistic bacteria as enterobacter sp.,  acinetobacter, sphingomonas sp. and non-pathogenic bacillus, were also detected after dna sequencing of dgge bands.

AB  == the primary aim of this study was to evaluate the level of agreement of the e-test for in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing of campylobacter coli using the agar dilution technique, which is the approved method. a convenience sample of 80 ontario swine farms was chosen for this study; each farm was visited from january to june 2004. a total of 233 isolates of c. coli were tested for susceptibility to 10 antimicrobials by agar dilution and the e-test. performance  of the tests was evaluated using 7 quality control strains: escherichia coli atcc 25922, staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213, campylobacter jejuni atcc 33560, and campylobacter coli atcc 33559 for the e-test and e. coli atcc 25922, pseudomonas  aeruginosa atcc 27853, and c. jejuni atcc 33560 for the agar dilution test. weighted cohen's kappa and prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa (pabak) tests  were used for statistical analysis. the e-test and agar dilution test results had a strong agreement when resistance to streptomycin and tetracycline were evaluated (weighted kappa: 0.68 and 0.66, respectively). however, marked disagreement was detected when testing susceptibility to nalidixic acid and ampicillin (0.15 and 0.22, respectively). almost perfect agreement was detected by pabak when testing susceptibility to gentamicin (0.99). agreement was found to be moderate for ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, clindamycin, erythromycin, and chloramphenicol. although the level of agreement between the e-test and agar dilution depended on the antimicrobial being tested, the e-test always detected a lower proportion of resistant isolates compared to agar dilution.

TI  == lfna from pseudomonas aeruginosa o12 and wbux from escherichia coli o145 encode membrane-associated proteins and are required for expression of 2,6-dideoxy-2-acetamidino-l-galactose in lipopolysaccharide o antigen.
AB  == the rare sugar 2,6-dideoxy-2-acetamidino-l-galactose (l-fucnam) is found only in  bacteria and is a component of cell surface glycans in a number of pathogenic species, including the o antigens of pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype o12 and escherichia coli o145. p. aeruginosa is an important opportunistic pathogen, and  the o12 serotype is associated with multidrug-resistant epidemic outbreaks. o145  is one of the classic non-o157 serotypes associated with shiga toxin-producing, enterohemorrhagic e. coli. the acetamidino (nam) moiety of l-fucnam is of interest, because at neutral ph it contributes a positive charge to the cell surface, and we aimed to characterize the biosynthesis of this functional group.  the pathway is not known, but expression of nam-modified sugars coincides with the presence of a psea homologue in the relevant biosynthetic locus. psea is a putative amidotransferase required for synthesis of a nam-modified sugar in campylobacter jejuni. in p. aeruginosa o12 and e. coli o145, the psea homologues  are lfna and wbux, respectively, and we hypothesized that these genes function in l-fucnam biosynthesis. sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, western blotting, and nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of the lfna mutant o-antigen structure indicated that the mutant expresses 2,6-dideoxy-2-acetamido-l-galactose (l-fucnac) in place of l-fucnam. the mutation could be complemented by expression of either his(6)-tagged lfna or wbux in trans, confirming that these genes are functional homologues and that they are required for nam moiety synthesis. both proteins retained their activity when fused to a his(6) tag and localized to the membrane fraction. these data will assist future biochemical investigation of this pathway.

AB  == strain nrrl b-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, or enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as  antagonistic to campylobacter jejuni. the isolate produced a 5,362-da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis,  s. enterica serovar choleraesuis, s. enterica serovar typhimurium, s. enterica serovar gallinarum, escherichia coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni, and 20  other campylobacter species isolates. the enterocin, e-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. the proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin e-760 was demonstrated upon treatment  with various proteolytic enzymes. specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase k, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. the enterocin demonstrated thermostability  by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees c and was stable at ph values between 5.0 and 8.7. however, activity was lost below ph 3.0 and above ph 9.5. administration of enterocin e-760-treated feed significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized  with two strains of c. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) cfu. enterocin e-760 also significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.

AB  == viable but non-culturable (vbnc) bacteria concept has been defined in 1982 when it has been shown that there exists bacteria whose metabolic activity continue and which can have the ability to reproduce in suitable conditions although they  have lost their capability to reproduce in culture. recent studies have shown that most of the human pathogens (campylobacter spp., escherichia coli, francisella tularensis, helicobacter pylori, legionella pneumophila, listeria monocytogenes, mycobacterium tuberculosis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella spp., shigella spp., vibrio cholerae, v. parahaemolyticus, v. vulnificus) have vbnc form. the interest on this subject has increased due to the detection of some disinfection procedures such as pasteurization of milk and chlorinization of water, cause bacteria to switch to vbnc form. it is thought that, the bacteria in this form may have an important role in recurrent and drug resistant infections as well as infections of unknown origin. however, advanced studies should be done to clarify the role of vbnc bacteria in the setting of recurrent infections, together with their pathogenity and antibiotic resistance. in this review article, the importance of viable but non-culturable bacteria, their morphology,  metabolic and genetic properties, pathogenity, resuscitation and identification have been discussed.

TI  == oxygen reactivity of both respiratory oxidases in campylobacter jejuni: the cydab genes encode a cyanide-resistant, low-affinity oxidase that is not of the cytochrome bd type.
AB  == the microaerophilic bacterium campylobacter jejuni is a significant food-borne pathogen and is predicted to possess two terminal respiratory oxidases with unknown properties. inspection of the genome reveals an operon (cydab) apparently encoding a cytochrome bd-like oxidase homologous to oxidases in escherichia coli  and azotobacter vinelandii. however, c. jejuni cells lacked all spectral signals  characteristic of the high-spin hemes b and d of these oxidases. mutation of the  cydab operon of c. jejuni did not have a significant effect on growth, but the mutation reduced formate respiration and the viability of cells cultured in 5% oxygen. since cyanide resistance of respiration was diminished in the mutant, we  propose that c. jejuni cydab be renamed cioab (cyanide-insensitive oxidase), as in pseudomonas aeruginosa. we measured the oxygen affinity of each oxidase, using a highly sensitive assay that exploits globin deoxygenation during respiration-catalyzed oxygen uptake. the cioab-type oxidase exhibited a relatively low affinity for oxygen (k(m) = 0.8 microm) and a v(max) of >20 nmol/mg/s. expression of cioab was elevated fivefold in cells grown at higher rates of oxygen provision. the alternative, cconoqp-encoded cyanide-sensitive oxidase, expected to encode a cytochrome cb'-type enzyme, plays a major role in the microaerobic respiration of c. jejuni, since it appeared to be essential for  viability and exhibited a much higher oxygen affinity, with a k(m) value of 40 nm and a v(max) of 6 to 9 nmol/mg/s. low-temperature photodissociation spectrophotometry revealed that neither oxidase has ligand-binding activity typical of the heme-copper oxidase family. these data are consistent with cytochrome oxidation during photolysis at low temperatures.

TI  == the group b streptococcal sialic acid o-acetyltransferase is encoded by neud, a conserved component of bacterial sialic acid biosynthetic gene clusters.
AB  == nearly two dozen microbial pathogens have surface polysaccharides or lipo-oligosaccharides that contain sialic acid (sia), and several sia-dependent virulence mechanisms are known to enhance bacterial survival or result in host tissue injury. some pathogens are also known to o-acetylate their sias, although  the role of this modification in pathogenesis remains unclear. we report that neud, a gene located within the group b streptococcus (gbs) sia biosynthetic gene cluster, encodes a sia o-acetyltransferase that is itself required for capsular polysaccharide (cps) sialylation. homology modeling and site-directed mutagenesis identified lys-123 as a critical residue for sia o-acetyltransferase activity. moreover, a single nucleotide polymorphism in neud can determine whether gbs displays a "high" or "low" sia o-acetylation phenotype. complementation analysis  revealed that escherichia coli k1 neud also functions as a sia o-acetyltransferase in gbs. in fact, neud homologs are commonly found within sia  biosynthetic gene clusters. a bioinformatic approach identified 18 bacterial species with a sia biosynthetic gene cluster that included neud. included in this list are the sialylated human pathogens legionella pneumophila, vibrio parahemeolyticus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and campylobacter jejuni, as well as an additional 12 bacterial species never before analyzed for sia expression. phylogenetic analysis shows that neud homologs of sialylated pathogens share a common evolutionary lineage distinct from the poly-sia o-acetyltransferase of e.  coli k1. these studies define a molecular genetic approach for the selective elimination of gbs sia o-acetylation without concurrent loss of sialylation, a key to further studies addressing the role(s) of this modification in bacterial virulence.

AB  == campylobacter jejuni has a general n-linked protein glycosylation system that can be functionally transferred to escherichia coli. in this study, we engineered e.  coli cells in a way that two different pathways, protein n-glycosylation and lipopolysaccharide (lps) biosynthesis, converge at the step in which pglb, the key enzyme of the c. jejuni n-glycosylation system, transfers o polysaccharide from a lipid carrier (undecaprenyl pyrophosphate) to an acceptor protein. pglb was the only protein of the bacterial n-glycosylation machinery both necessary and sufficient for the transfer. the relaxed specificity of the pglb oligosaccharyltransferase toward the glycan structure was exploited to create novel n-glycan structures containing two distinct e. coli or pseudomonas aeruginosa o antigens. pglb-mediated transfer of polysaccharides might be valuable for in vivo production of o polysaccharides-protein conjugates for use as antibacterial vaccines.

TI  == diverse effects of ascorbic acid and palmitoyl ascorbate on helicobacter pylori survival and growth.
AB  == among many antioxidants used in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, ascorbic acid (aa) is one of the most important. aa has been suggested to decrease the risk of gastric disease (gastritis, duodenal ulcer, and carcinoma) by direct action on helicobacter pylori. however, there are limited studies on the possible role of aa and its derivatives such as palmitoyl ascorbate (pa) on the growth and survival of h. pylori. in the present study it was demonstrated in vitro that aa in the concentration range 10-20 mg x ml(-1) (50-100 mm) inhibited  h. pylori growth in liquid medium under microaerophilic conditions. in contrast,  under aerobic conditions aa in the concentration range 2-20 mg x ml(-1) (10-100 mm) significantly increased the survival of h. pylori presumably eliminating the  toxic effect of reactive oxygen species on bacterial cells. the hydrophobic derivative of aa, pa (a food antioxidant), demonstrated a strong antibacterial effect, under both aerobic and microaerophilic conditions in the concentration range 0.04-0.4 mg x ml(-1) (0.1-1.0 mm). this effect was also tested on other bacterial strains: escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, clostridium sporogenes and campylobacter jejuni. among these bacterial strains, pa showed a similar inhibitory effect on b. cereus and b. subtilis as observed with h. pylori. the results suggest that pa may be considered an important aa derivative  in eradication of h. pylori in vitro and in vivo and to decrease the risk for gastric diseases.

TI  == bacterial hemoglobins and flavohemoglobins for alleviation of nitrosative stress  in escherichia coli.
AB  == escherichia coli mg1655 cells expressing novel bacterial hemoglobin and flavohemoglobin genes from a medium-copy-number plasmid were grown in shake flask cultures under nitrosative and oxidative stress. e. coli cells expressing these proteins display enhanced resistance against the no(.) releaser sodium nitroprusside (snp) relative to that of the control strain bearing the parental plasmid. expression of bacterial hemoglobins originating from campylobacter jejuni (chb) and vitreoscilla sp. (vhb) conferred resistance on snp-challenged cells. in addition, it has been shown that no(.) detoxification is also a common  feature of flavohemoglobins originating from different taxonomic groups and can be transferred to a heterologous host. these observations have been confirmed in  a specific in vitro no(.) consumption assay. protein extracts isolated from e. coli strains overexpressing flavohemoglobins consumed authentic no(.) more readily than protein extracts from the wild-type strain. oxidative challenge to the cells evoked nonuniform responses from the various cell cultures. improved oxidative-stress-sustaining properties had also been observed when the flavohemoglobins from e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, deinococcus radiodurans, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were expressed in e. coli.

TI  == antibody reactivity of a standardized human serum protein solution against a spectrum of microbial pathogens and toxins: comparison with fresh frozen plasma.
AB  == in this study, we compared a standardized solution of human serum protein (hsp) and fresh frozen plasma (ffp) with regard to the antibody specificity against a number of microbial pathogens and some important pathogenicity factors of bacterial pathogens. due to the clinical use of hsp and ffp for therapeutical plasma exchange, we have chosen a spectrum of microbial pathogens for serological analysis that is critical in clinical settings. with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, we could show that hsp contains marked igg antibody reactivity against antigens of escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, enterobacter sakazakii, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, chlamydia pneumoniae, and candida albicans. although no igm antibodies against the pathogens tested could be detected in hsp, moderate iga reactivity was found against 4 of 12 microbial antigens. immunoblot analysis  demonstrated specific iga and igg responses against the endoproteinase glu-c and  the superantigens enterotoxin a and b of s. aureus, the iga-protease of neisseria gonorrhoeae, and shiga toxin 2 of enterohemorrhagic e. coli. by using 3 different hsp batches in parallel, we could demonstrate antibody reactivity against important microbial pathogens and toxins. this antibody profile is essentially more homogeneous than that of 3 batches of ffp.

TI  == [the current antimicrobial resistance situation in swiss veterinary medicine].
AB  == antimicrobial susceptibility data (n = 1501) and bacterial isolates (n = 258) of  important bacterial pathogens from animals were collected in collaboration with eight swiss laboratories from may 1999 to february 2000. using these data, the antimicrobial resistance situation could be assessed for the following bacterial  species: escherichia coli, salmonella, haemophilus parasuis, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, pasteurella multocida, mannheimia haemolytica, bordetella bronchiseptica, campylobacter jejuni, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus intermedius, streptococci, and enterococci. differences in the distribution of resistance between animal species could be evidenced in e. coli and salmonella. some resistance frequency data were compared with those obtained in 1980. a significant increase of resistance frequency was observed for several antibiotics. this includes in particular an increase of ampicillin, gentamicin, and cotrimoxazole resistance in e. coli. a similar increase was observed in salmonella for ampicillin, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and nalidixic  acid. staphylococci from dogs (s. intermedius and s. aureus) also presented a clear increase of resistance for penicillin, neomycin, sulfonamides, cotrimoxazole, and erythromycin. finally, a comparison with data from abroad shows that the antibiotic resistance situation in switzerland is relatively favorable.

AB  == the value of blind terminal subcultures (7 and 30 days) and prolonged incubation  (30 days) of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients was analyzed in the fundacion favaloro, the fundacion para la lucha contra las enfermedades neurologicas de la infancia and the hospital de ninos ricardo gutierrez. a total  of 2707 blood cultures and 369 patients were included (transplantation of solid organs 154, oncohematologic disorders 106 and solid tumors 109). bact-alert bottles were incubated at 35 degrees c for 30 days in the bact-alert system. bottles with positive signals were routinely removed, and aliquots of the broth were gram stained and subcultured aerobically in chocolate agar and sabouraud agar. a total of 136 bacteremic episodes were obtained. the positivization time of blood cultures was 81.6% at 24 h, 93.3% at 48 h, 94.5% at 72 h and 97.7% within 7 days. only 3 (2.2%) episodes were positive by blind terminal subcultures and 1 (0.75%) by prolonged incubation (14 days). the median time and range of positivization in hours were 13.8 and 2.2-168, respectively. the microorganisms isolated were coagulase negative staphylococci (n = 24), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 22), staphylococcus aureus (n = 21), escherichia coli (n = 18), acinetobacter spp (n = 9), candida spp (n = 8), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 6), enterobacter cloacae (n = 5), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 5), enterococcus faecalis, salmonella spp and capnocytophaga sputigena (n = 2), enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecium, citrobacter diversus, candida albicans, klebsiella oxytoca, chryseomonas luteola, serratia marcescens, abiotrophia spp, campylobacter jejuni, moraxella catarrhalis, moraxella urethralis, neisseria sicca, beta hemolytic group g streptococci, rhodococcus equi, micrococcus spp, cryptococcus neoformans  and streptococcus mitis (n = 1). in our experience, blind terminal subcultures and prolonged incubation of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients are unnecessary and cost expensive.

TI  == novel hemoglobins to enhance microaerobic growth and substrate utilization in escherichia coli.
AB  == limited oxygen availability is a prevalent problem in microbial biotechnology. recombinant escherichia coli expressing the hemoglobin from vitreoscilla (vhb) or the flavohemoglobin from ralstonia eutropha (formerly alcaligenes eutrophus) (fhp) demonstrate significantly increased cell growth and productivity under microaerobic conditions. we identify novel bacterial hemoglobin-like proteins and examine if these novel bacterial hemoglobins can elicit positive effects similar  to vhb and fhp and if these hemoglobins alleviate oxygen limitation under microaerobic conditions when expressed in e. coli. several finished and unfinished bacterial genomes were screened using r. eutropha fhp as a query sequence for genes (hmp) encoding hemoglobin-like proteins. novel hmp genes were  identified in pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, klebsiella pneumoniae, deinococcus radiodurans, and campylobacter jejuni. previously characterized hmp genes from e. coli and bacillus subtilis and the novel hmp genes from p. aeruginosa, s. typhi, c. jejuni, k. pneumoniae, and d. radiodurans were pcr amplified and introduced into a plasmid for expression in e. coli. biochemically  active hemoproteins were expressed in all constructs, as judged by the ability to abduct carbon monoxide. growth behavior and byproduct formation of e. coli k-12 mg1655 cells expressing various hemoglobins were analyzed in microaerobic fed-batch cultivations and compared to plasmid-bearing control and to e. coli cells expressing vhb. the clones expressing hemoglobins from e. coli, d. radiodurans, p.aeruginosa, and s. typhi reached approximately 10%, 27%, 23%, and  36% higher final optical density values, respectively, relative to the plasmid bearing e. coli control (a(600) 5.5). e. coli cells expressing hemoproteins from  p. aeruginosa, s. typhi, and d. radiodurans grew to similar final cell densities  as did the strain expressing vhb (a(600) 7.5), although none of the novel constructs was able to outgrow the vhb-expressing e. coli strain. additionally, increased yield of biomass on glucose was measured for all recombinant strains, and an approximately 2-fold yield enhancement was obtained with d. radiodurans hemoprotein-expressing e. coli relative to the e. coli control carrying the parental plasmid without any hemoglobin gene.

TI  == the iron- and temperature-regulated cjrbc genes of shigella and enteroinvasive escherichia coli strains code for colicin js uptake.
AB  == a cosmid library of dna from colicin js-sensitive enteroinvasive escherichia coli (eiec) strain o164 was made in colicin js-resistant strain e. coli vcs257, and colicin js-sensitive clones were identified. sensitivity to colicin js was associated with the carriage of a three-gene operon upstream of and partially overlapping senb. the open reading frames were designated cjrabc (for colicin js  receptor), coding for proteins of 291, 258, and 753 amino acids, respectively. tn7 insertions in any of them led to complete resistance to colicin js. a near-consensus fur box was found upstream of cjra, suggesting regulation of the cjr operon by iron levels. cjra protein was homologous to iron-regulated pseudomonas aeruginosa protein phuw, whose function is unknown; cjrb was homologous to the tonb protein from pseudomonas putida; and cjrc was homologous to a putative outer membrane siderophore receptor from campylobacter jejuni. cloning experiments showed that the cjrb and cjrc genes are sufficient for colicin js sensitivity. uptake of colicin js into sensitive bacteria was dependent on the exbb protein but not on the e. coli k-12 tonb and tola, -b, and  -q proteins. sensitivity to colicin js is positively regulated by temperature via the virb protein and negatively controlled by the iron source through the fur protein. among eiec strains, two types of colicin js-sensitive phenotypes were identified that differed in sensitivity to colicin js by 1 order of magnitude. the difference in sensitivity to colicin js is not due to differences between the sequences of the cjrb and cjrc proteins.

TI  == microbiological status of commercially available medicinal herbal drugs--a screening study.
AB  == one hundred and thirty-eight medicinal herbal drugs obtained from different suppliers were examined for microbial contaminants and for the detectability of pathogenic microorganisms. for this purpose, several microbiological standard parameters (total aerobic mesophilic count, enterobacteria, coliforms, aerobic sporeformers, yeasts and moulds, enterococci, lactobacilli, pseudomonades and aeromades) and selective methods for the detection of indicator microorganisms and pathogens (e. coli, enterohaemorrhagic e. coli [ehec], salmonella, campylobacter jejuni, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, listeria, coagulase-positive staphylococci, candida albicans, potentially aflatoxigenic moulds) were applied. the microbial load of the samples varied considerably. while none of the samples contained ehec, salmonellae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, listeriae, staphylococcus aureus or candida albicans, four samples were e. coli positive, two samples were presumptively campylobacter  jejuni positive and nine herbal drugs contained a potentially aflatoxigenic mould flora. further details regarding different viable count classes as well as preparation techniques are discussed.

TI  == emerging mechanisms of fluoroquinolone resistance.
AB  == broad use of fluoroquinolones has been followed by emergence of resistance, which has been due mainly to chromosomal mutations in genes encoding the subunits of the drugs' target enzymes, dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv, and in genes that affect the expression of diffusion channels in the outer membrane and multidrug-resistance efflux systems. resistance emerged first in species in which single mutations were sufficient to cause clinically important levels of resistance (e.g., staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa). subsequently, however, resistance has emerged in bacteria such as campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, in which multiple mutations  are required to generate clinically important resistance. in these circumstances, the additional epidemiologic factors of drug use in animals and human-to-human spread appear to have contributed. resistance in streptococcus pneumoniae, which  is currently low, will require close monitoring as fluoroquinolones are used more extensively for treating respiratory tract infections.

TI  == use of oleic acid to reduce the population of the bacterial flora of poultry skin.
AB  == the effect of oleic acid on native bacterial flora of poultry skin was examined.  skin from commercial broiler carcasses was washed once or twice in solutions of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10% (wt/vol) oleic acid and rinsed in peptone water. aerobic bacteria, enterobacteriaceae, campylobacter, and enterococci in the rinsates were enumerated. significantly fewer aerobic bacteria, enterobacteriaceae, campylobacter, and enterococci were recovered from rinsates of skin washed in oleic acid than from control samples. additionally, fewer bacteria were recovered from rinsates of skin washed in higher concentrations of oleic acid than from skin washed in lower concentrations of the fatty acid. in most cases, there was no significant difference in the number of bacteria recovered from rinsates of skin washed once or twice in solutions of oleic acid. washing skin samples twice  in 10% solutions of oleic acid significantly reduced the number of aerobic bacteria, enterobacteriaceae, campylobacter, and enterococci that remained attached to the skin. campylobacter sp., enterococcus faecalis, and listeria monocytogenes isolates possessed the least resistance to the antibacterial activity of oleic acid in vitro, while escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed higher resistance. enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus lentus, and salmonella typhimurium had the greatest resistance to the antibacterial activity of oleic acid. findings indicate that oleic acid reduces the number of bacteria on the skin of processed broilers and that the fatty acid is bactericidal to several spoilage and pathogenic bacteria associated with poultry.

TI  == kombucha fermentation and its antimicrobial activity.
AB  == kombucha was prepared in a tea broth (0.5% w/v) supplemented with sucrose (10% w/v) by using a commercially available starter culture. the ph decreased steadily from 5 to 2.5 during the fermentation while the weight of the "tea fungus" and the od of the tea broth increased through 4 days of the fermentation and remained fairly constant thereafter. the counts of acetic acid-producing bacteria and yeasts in the broth increased up to 4 days of fermentation and decreased afterward. the antimicrobial activity of kombucha was investigated against a number of pathogenic microorganisms. staphylococcus aureus, shigella sonnei, escherichia coli, aeromonas hydrophila, yersinia enterolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus epidermis, campylobacter jejuni, salmonella enteritidis, salmonella typhimurium, bacillus cereus, helicobacterpylori, and listeria monocytogenes were found to be sensitive to kombucha. according to the literature on kombucha, acetic acid is considered to be responsible for the inhibitory effect toward a number of microbes tested, and  this is also valid in the present study. however, in this study, kombucha proved  to exert antimicrobial activities against e. coli, sh. sonnei, sal. typhimurium,  sal. enteritidis, and cm. jejuni, even at neutral ph and after thermal denaturation. this finding suggests the presence of antimicrobial compounds other than acetic acid and large proteins in kombucha.

TI  == trends in bacterial resistance to fluoroquinolones.
AB  == the emergence of resistance to fluoroquinolones in virtually all species of bacteria was recognized soon after the introduction of these compounds for clinical use more than 10 years ago. various resistance mechanisms, often interdependent, may explain different levels of resistance. epidemiological factors, local antibiotic policies, patients' characteristics, origin of the strains, and geographic location are among the factors contributing to highly variable resistance rates. during the last several years, resistance to fluoroquinolones has remained very high among methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains and in intensive care unit patients, and it has increased among nosocomial isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. more worrisome are recent reports of an overall increase in resistance to fluoroquinolones among bacteria responsible for community-acquired infections, such as escherichia coli, salmonella species, campylobacter species and neisseria gonorrhoeae.

AB  == background: the aim of our study was to determine the diagnostic yield of culture for bacteria and fungi from colonic biopsy specimens in 290 consecutive hiv-infected patients with diarrhea. methods: during each colonoscopy, three biopsy specimens were homogenized and cultured on media for salmonella and shigella and for campylobacter and yersinia, on loewenstein medium and on sabouraud medium. results: cultures were found positive for one (n = 32) or two (n = 5) infectious agents in 37 cases, i.e., in 12.8% of the patients. bacteria were isolated in 24 cases, and identified as campylobacter jejunl-coli (n = 14),  salmonella (n = 2), shigella (n = 1), or pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 7). among the 14 patients with c. jejuni-coli intestinal infection, 11 had normal-appearing mucosa at colonoscopy, and 3 had a concomitant stool culture negative for campylobacter. mycobacterial cultures were positive for mycobacterium avium intracellulare in 6 patients, who were already known as having a disseminated m.  avium intracellulare infection from positive blood cultures. fungal cultures were positive for candida in 10 cases, without clear clinical significance. conclusions: the overall yield of culture for bacterial pathogens from colonic tissue in hiv-infected patients with diarrhea is low, but some individual cases of c. jejuni-coli infections may be detected from colonic tissue culture and not  diagnosed by concomitant stool culture.

TI  == genetic analysis of the minimal replicon of plasmid pip417 and comparison with the other encoding 5-nitroimidazole resistance plasmids from bacteroides spp.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the dna replication origin region of a bacteroides vulgatus plasmid, pip417, encoding 5-nitroimidazole resistance has been determined. this region of 1934 bp presents some characteristics similar to those of other replication protein-dependent origins. it contains a large open reading  frame which could encode a basic rep protein (repa) of 36.8 kda. upstream of this orf exist an at-rich region, three direct repeats (iterons) of 21 bp, multiple dnaa binding sites, and sites, and sites for the integration host factor (ihf). moreover, the amino acid sequence of the pip417 repa protein shows similarities with those of other rep proteins encoded by plasmids of gram-negative bacteria: pro1600 from pseudomonas aeruginosa; pps10 from pseudomonas syringae; pfa3 from neisseria gonorrhoeae; and two cryptic plasmids from campylobacter hyointestinalis and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens. although repa can be expressed in  an escherichia coli in vitro transcription-translation assay, vectors containing  the pip417 replication origin did not replicate in e. coli. the homology of the pip417 replication region with the corresponding regions of other bacteroides spp, plasmids was also studied by southern blot hybridization. the results indicated that the repa gene of plasmid pip417 is homologous to that of plasmid pip421, but not of plasmid pip419. the replication region of plasmid pip421 was sequenced and showed about 80% identity at the nucleotide level with that of pip417. a small (3634-bp) cloning vector (pfk12) of entirely defined nucleotide sequence was constructed for bacteroides spp.

AB  == gastric infection with helicobacter pylori activates a mucosal inflammatory response by mononuclear cells and neutrophils that includes expression of cytokines interleukin-1 beta (il-1 beta), il-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and  il-8. in this study, we analyzed the il-8 response of human gastric cancer cell lines (kato iii, ags, and mkn28) to h. pylori infection in vitro. il-8 mrna expression was detected by reverse transcription-pcr amplification of rna extracted from epithelial cells after incubation with different h. pylori wild-type and mutant strains, and il-8 secretion was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. exposure to viable h. pylori induced il-8 mrna and protein synthesis in all three gastric cell lines but not in nongastric epithelial cell lines. heat-killed h. pylori and a crude cytotoxin preparation did not induce significant il-8 secretion. il-8 mrna peaked between 2 and 4 h postinfection, and il-8 protein production was maximal 24 h postinfection. exposure of gastric carcinoma cells to other gastrointestinal bacteria, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, campylobacter jejuni, and escherichia coli, but not campylobacter fetus, induced il-8 synthesis. wild-type strains that expressed the vacuolating cytotoxin (tox+) and a cytotoxin-associated gene (caga) product (caga+) induced significantly more il-8 than did caga- tox- strains. however, there was no decrease in il-8 induction by isogenic mutants of caga-, tox-, or cag- tox- strains or by a mutant lacking the urease subunits. these results indicate that exposure to h. pylori and other gram-negative organisms that do not colonize the  gastric mucosa induces il-8 production by gastric carcinoma cells in vitro. although the caga+ tox+ phenotype of h. pylori is associated with enhanced il-8 production by gastric cell lines, other bacterial constituents are clearly essential.

TI  == cross-reactive antigens shared by pseudomonas aeruginosa, helicobacter pylori, campylobacter jejuni, and haemophilus influenzae may cause false-positive titers  of antibody to h. pylori.
AB  == cystic fibrosis (cf) patients suffer from many of the gastrointestinal conditions which occur in non-cf individuals, e.g., dyspepsia and peptic ulceration. these symptoms may be caused by helicobacter pylori but could also be due to either pancreatic insufficiency or the intensive antibiotic treatment used in cf patients. since cf patients chronically infected with pseudomonas aeruginosa produce antibodies against a wide range of antigens, including antigens common to many other bacteria, e.g., groel and lipopolysaccharide, we studied, by the western blot (immunoblot) technique, the specificity of immunoglobulin g antibodies to h. pylori in danish cf patients chronically infected with p. aeruginosa, cf patients without p. aeruginosa infection but with haemophilus influenzae infection, patients with dyspeptic ulcers associated with h. pylori, and patients recovering from acute campylobacter jejuni or campylobacter coli infection. sera from cf patients with chronic p. aeruginosa or h. influenzae infection and patients recovering from acute c. jejuni infection cross-reacted with h. pylori antigens. a strong cross-reacting protein antigen at approximately 14 kda and minor cross-reactive antigens at approximately 27, 30, and 60 kda (the heat shock protein groel is equivalent to the common antigen of p. aeruginosa) could be demonstrated. the results of this study show that high immunoglobulin g  antibody titers against h. pylori in cf patients cannot be regarded as indicating present or past h. pylori infection unless their specificity is proven by absorption studies.

TI  == investigation of helicobacter pylori ascorbic acid oxidating activity.
AB  == helicobacter pylori sonicate was shown to oxidize ascorbic acid. ascorbic acid oxidation was determined by chromatography combined with electrochemical detection. water soluble ascorbic acid oxidase activity was rather independent of ph with a ph optimum around 2. by gel filtration the oxidizing activity co-eluted with an absorbency peak at 408 nm. the relative molecular mass (mr) was approximately 14,000. it is suggested that this oxidating activity was caused by  a cytochrome c-like molecule. ascorbic acid oxidating activity could also be extracted from bacterial membranes by detergents. gel filtration showed several forms, the major one with a mr = 19,000. ph optimum was 6-7. other oxidase-positive bacterial strains like campylobacter coli, enterobacter cloacae  and pseudomonas aeruginosa could degrade ascorbic acid. since ascorbic acid oxidation by helicobacter pylori whole bacterial lysates has a ph optimum in the  acidic range corresponding to ph in gastric fluid, the activity of the cytochrome c-like water soluble oxidant of helicobacter pylori seems to be primarily important for the destruction of ascorbic acid in the gastric juice of infected patients.

TI  == mechanisms of resistance to fluoroquinolones: state-of-the-art 1992-1994.
AB  == this paper gives an update on the mechanisms of bacterial resistance to fluoroquinolones. the laboratory techniques currently used to determine the mechanism(s) of resistance are outlined, including the use of restriction fragment length polymorphism and single-stranded conformational polymorphism analysis of mutations in gyra. alterations in gyra have continued to be the most  reported cause of resistance, with high level resistance due to 2 or more mutations in this gene. recently, mutations in gyra of mycobacterium tuberculosis and campylobacter jejuni have been described. complementation studies with plasmid encoded cloned gyrb from escherichia coli suggest that high fluoroquinolone resistance (minimum inhibitory concentration = 32 mg/l) in salmonella typhimurium can be due to mutation in both gyra and gyrb. decreased fluoroquinolone accumulation into e. coli has been shown to be due to mutations in a number of genes at different loci. current interest has focused upon the marrab and soxrs loci, with mutations in genes of either loci giving rise to decreased susceptibility to several unrelated drugs, including fluoroquinolones,  tetracycline, chloramphenicol and some beta-lactams, and decreased expression of  ompf. the genetic characterisation of fluoroquinolone efflux from staphylococcus  aureus has shown that efflux occurs in both fluoroquinolone-susceptible and -resistant bacteria. the most likely cause of resistance is overexpression of nora, giving rise to increased efflux. recently, 2 efflux systems in pseudomonas  aeruginosa have been proposed, mexa-mexb-oprk and mexc-mexd-oprm, conferring decreased susceptibility to fluoroquinolones, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and some beta-lactams.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == monitoring sand and sea water of the mediterranean tel aviv beaches during 1989-1991 for bacterial quality showed varying data and no correlation between standard bacteria parameters (sbp) and potential pathogenic bacteria (ppb). an exceptional feature was observed in 1989 when faecal coliforms including escherichia coli and faecal streptococcus were less in sand than in sea water. these results may be attributed to the low turbulent activity of the sea in 1989, particularly in summer, compared with the next two years. in 1990 the number of sbp and ppb was always higher in sand than in sea water. the most frequent micro-organisms isolated from sand were e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans. intensive engineering work and the construction of a chlorinator for sewage probably caused a dramatic drop in the number of sbp and ppb in sea water and sand during 1990-1991 on some beaches. campylobacter jejuni  was isolated from sand, and may be considered a possible hazard factor for enteritis in the population bathing at these beaches.

TI  == mechanisms of quinolone resistance.
AB  == two mechanisms of resistance to fluoroquinolones are known: (i) alteration of the molecular target of quinolone action-dna gyrase, and (ii) reduction of the quinolone accumulation. mutations altering the n-terminus of the gyrase a subunit, especially those around residues ser83 and asp87, significantly reduce the susceptibilities towards all quinolones, while alterations of the gyrase b subunit are rarely found and are of minor importance. reduced drug accumulation is associated with alterations of the outer membrane protein profile in gram-negative bacteria. such mutations include the mara locus in escherichia coli and result in low level resistance towards quinolones and unrelated drugs. increased activity of naturally existing efflux systems, such as the transmembrane protein nora of staphylococci, may also lead to reduced accumulation in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. clinical fluoroquinolone resistance is rarely found in intrinsically highly susceptible organisms such as enterobacteriaceae and involves a combination of at least two mutations. in contrast, species with moderate intrinsic susceptibility such as campylobacter jejuni, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus require only one mutation to become clinically resistant. as a consequence development of resistance during therapy may result from acquisition of already resistant strains in the case of susceptible species, and selection of mutants in the case  of less susceptible species.

TI  == [ciprofloxacin resistance in gram negative bacilli. epidemiologic aspects].
AB  == background: the aim of the present was to study the resistance to ciprofloxacin (cip) in gram negative bacilli (april 1990-march 1992) and to determine the temporary distribution of the resistant strains by species, samples and departments. methods: seven thousand four hundred seventy-eight samples were studied. the identification and determination of the sensitivity was performed by the pasco (difco) system. haemophilus spp. and campylobacter spp. were excluded from the study. the microorganisms with cim 2 mg/l were considered as resistant (cipr). results: four hundred eighty-one cipr isolations were identified (6.4%).  with regard to the percentage of resistant strains, the species with the highest  were: providencia stuartii (50%); pseudomonas cepacia (44.4%); xanthomonas maltophilia (26.9%); acinetobacter baumannii (25.8%); pseudomonas aeruginosa (16%); citrobacter freundii (12.5%); serratia marcescens (8.4%); enterobacter cloacae (5.8%) and escherichia coli (4.3%). with respect to the absolute number of resistant strains, the most frequent resistant strains were: p. aeruginosa (205), e. coli (144), and a. baumannii (41). isolation of e. coli and a. baumannii cipr increased over the study period. forty-four point five percent of  the e. coli cipr were of extrahospitalary origin; most of the a. baumannii (92.9%) and p. aeruginosa (77.6%) in contrast were of intrahospitalary origin. conclusions: p. aeruginosa, e. coli, and a. baumannii are the most frequently resistant species. the frequency of isolation of resistant strains of e. coli and a. baumannii significantly increased (p < 0.001) over the two years of the study.

TI  == antibacterial spectrum of lactoferricin b, a potent bactericidal peptide derived  from the n-terminal region of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  == a physiologically diverse range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin b, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. the list of susceptible organisms includes escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, corynebacterium diphtheriae, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium perfringens.  concentrations of lactoferricin b required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 micrograms/ml, depending on the strain and  the culture medium used. the peptide showed activity against e. coli o111 over the range of ph 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of na+, k+, mg2+ or ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. lactoferricin  b was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability in most of the species tested. pseudomonas fluorescens, enterococcus faecalis and bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of am-1155, a new 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone.
AB  == am-1155 is a new quinolone with a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity against various bacteria including anaerobes and mycoplasma pneumoniae. am-1155 was 2- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant strains, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis; its mics for 90% of strains  tested were 0.10 to 0.78 micrograms/ml. the activity of am-1155 was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, but was fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. against xanthomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and campylobacter jejuni, am-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin. at a concentration of 1.56 micrograms/ml, am-1155 inhibited 90% of bacteroides fragilis strains tested; its activity was 8- to 10-fold higher than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. development of resistance to am-1155 in s. aureus and s. epidermidis occurred at a lower frequency than did that to ciprofloxacin after eight transfers in the presence of drug. in the oral treatment of mouse systemic infections, am-1155 was four- to eightfold more effective than ciprofloxacin against gram-positive cocci and was as active as ciprofloxacin against gram-negative rods. the efficacy of an oral or a subcutaneous dose of am-1155 was two- to fivefold greater than that of ofloxacin. against experimental pneumonia with klebsiella pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa, am-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. am-1155 also had good efficacy against mouse ascending urinary tract infections with escherichia coli and p. aeruginosa. these results suggest that am-1155 may be a potent antibacterial agent applicable to various infections.

TI  == determination of the chromosomal size of three different strains of enterococcus  faecalis and one strain of enterococcus faecium.
AB  == pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used to determine the chromosomal size of three different strains of enterococcus faecalis and one strain of enterococcus faecium. the size determinations of og1x, a strain of e. faecalis widely used in  many laboratories for genetic studies, using sma i, not i, and sfi i alone or in  combination, ranged from 2,750 to 2,761 kb. using the same enzymes as with og1x,  the size of hh-67, a plasmid-free clinical isolate of e. faecalis, was determined to be 2,170-2,288 kb and the size of jh2-2, an e. faecalis recipient strain, ranged from 2,008 to 2,135 kb. the size range generated for ge-1, a plasmid-free  e. faecium strain, with the use of sma i, not i, and apa i was 2,045-2,155 kb. although og1x differed in size from the other three enterococci, each individual  enterococcal strain generated reproducible results in different experiments. however, for both e. faecalis og1x and e. faecium ge-1, one of the enzymes used generated a considerably smaller molecular size than that generated by the other  two enzymes. the discrepancy was due to visually undiscernible comigrating fragments, and serves to point out a potential source of error if fewer than two  enzymes are used to size a genome. the size discrepancies were resolved by digesting individual fragments with a second enzyme. the molecular sizes of these enterococcal strains are larger than that recently reported for campylobacter, smaller than that of escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and similar (og1x) or smaller (jh2-2, hh67, and ge-1) than the 2,819-kb reported for streptococcus mutans.

TI  == cross-reactive proteins of borrelia burgdorferi.
AB  == the specificity of serological tests for lyme borreliosis is impaired by cross-reacting antibodies. in order to select antigens for more specific tests, specific and cross-reactive proteins of borrelia burgdorferi must be identified.  therefore, to analyze cross reactions of borrelia burgdorferi with other bacteria, rabbit immune sera against heterologous bacteria (borrelia hermsii, treponema pallidum, treponema phagedenis, leptospira interrogans (serogroup grippotyphosa), neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, yersinia enterocolitica (serotypes o3 and o9), campylobacter jejuni, listeria monocytogenes o1, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri and legionella micdadei) were examined by western  blot using borrelia burgdorferi as antigen. broad cross reactivity was shown for  borrelia proteins of the 60-75 kda range. other broadly cross-reacting proteins were at the level of p40, p33 and two proteins in the range of 20 kda. some of the cross reactions were eliminated by absorption of the sera with treponema phagedenis. the absorbed antibodies were directed mainly against bands at the level of p33 and bands of the 60 to 75 kda range. showing the lowest potential for cross reactivity, p100, p41, ospa and pc seem to be the most suitable antigens for serodiagnosis. in contrast to p100 and ospa, however, p41 and pc showed cross reactivity with immune sera against bacteria not belonging to the genus borrelia.

AB  == the authors present the first results on the utilization of fish infusion (ifp) as a basic medium for the cultivation of bacteria. the infusion was obtained from a common marine fish, corvina (micropogonias furnieri) according to the technique used in the preparation of beef infusion broth. streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, neisseria meningitidis, campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis were cultured in liquid and solid media prepared with ifp as well as in recommended standard media. solid media used for cultivation of s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, n. meningitidis and c. jejuni were supplemented with 5% of defibrinated sheep blood and for the latter, substances recommended to increase aerotolerance were included in solid and liquid media. all of these strains grew on the media prepared with ifp except s.  pneumoniae when cultured in ifp diluted 1:2 with a sodium chloride solution. only s. pyogenes produced colonies smaller than those of the standard medium. no more  differences were detect in the observation of colony morphology. the growth of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and b. subtilis was  measured in liquid media after 8 hours. in solid media, the growth index was expressed by dividing the number of colonies produced in ifp-agar and nutriente agar by the number of colonies on trypticase soy agar plates. some differences were observed in colonial size and morphology when compared with those generated  in standard media. the average value obtained from the analyses of total proteins by biuret reaction in twelve batches of ifp was 5.03 mg/ml. the experiments showed that culture media prepared with ifp supported the growth of bacterial strains used in this work. it suggests that fish infusion has promising conditions of being an alternative substrate for cultural purposes.

TI  == detection of ciprofloxacin resistance in gram-negative bacteria due to alterations in gyra.
AB  == two plasmids containing the cloned escherichia coli wild-type gyra gene were used to transform ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative clinical isolates to screen for dna gyrase a-mediated quinolone resistance. the results show that the technique is simple and applicable to a wide range of gram-negative species including e. coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella aerogenes, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, campylobacter jejuni and neisseria gonorrhoeae. the use of an arithmetical mic series of dilutions (as opposed to standard geometrical ones) was found to be essential during screening  for the detection of altered gyrase a. the observations were consistent with the  suggestion that dna gyrase is highly conserved among different species of bacteria and that gyrase a-mediated resistance can occur in all.

TI  == [antibacterial activities of ofloxacin against recent isolates from patients with community-acquired infections].
AB  == in order to survey antibacterial activities of ofloxacin (oflx) against 1,440 bacterial strains isolated from patients with community-acquired infections in 1987 and 1990, minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of the drug as well as those of other new quinolones and oral cephems were determined. the following conclusions were reached. 1. comparison of the mic distribution for strains isolated in 1987 with those in 1990 suggested a tendency toward an increase in the frequency of oflx-resistant isolates with the passage of time of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella ssp., enterobacter spp., proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. most common elevations of mic  values against these bacteria were observed in mic80 and mic90 values, while no significant alteration was observed in mic50 values. however, mic50's of oflx against serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa were relatively high for strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. most of the oflx-resistant strains of s.  aureus seemed to be methicillin-resistant (mrsa). furthermore, mic80 of oflx against coagulase-negative staphylococci was high in strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. 2. susceptibility of streptococcus spp. was evaluated only in strains isolated in 1990. the results were comparable to those reported by others in the early 1980s. 3. bacteria which showed no or infrequent emergence of oflx-resistant strains even in 1990 were proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, campylobacter spp. and peptostreptococcus spp. 4. recently isolated strains from patients with community-acquired infections showed a tendency toward an increase of the frequency of oflx-resistant strains among many bacteria. however, the bacteria which contained high percentages of oflx-resistant strains except for mrsa were so-called less-virulent bacteria, and in the other bacteria elevations of mic values were only observed in mic80 and mic90. these results suggested that oflx preserved a potent antibacterial activity against bacteria which were major causative pathogens in community-acquired infections.

TI  == effects of high hydrostatic pressure on characteristics of pork slurries and inactivation of microorganisms associated with meat and meat products.
AB  == pork slurries inoculated with various test microorganisms were prepared and subjected to high hydrostatic pressure at 1000 to 6000 atm for 10 min at 25 degrees c to examine for the pressure effects on characteristics of the slurries  and the inactivation of the microorganisms associated with meat and meat products. pressure treatment at higher than 3000 atm caused coagulation and discoloration of the pork slurries. harder and more white coagulants were obtained by increasing the pressure. pressure treatment at 3000 to 6000 atm killed all the microorganisms tested by more than 6-log colony-forming units (cfu)/g except bacillus cereus spores. gram-negative microorganisms were more labile to pressure than gram-positive ones. campylobacter jejuni, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica were inactivated at pressures higher than 3000 atm; escherichia coli, saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida utilis at pressures higher than 4000 atm; micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis at 6000 atm. only less than one-log cfu/g of b. cereus spores were inactivated at 6000 atm. ultraviolet absorption spectra and acridine orange staining suggested that e. coli became permeable and leaked cytoplasmic rna at lower pressure than s. aureus. from the present findings, the authors propose high hydrostatic pressure treatment as a promising means of preparing wholesome meat and meat products.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a difluoro-quinolone.
AB  == lomefloxacin is a new difluoro-quinolone. in this study, we have determined the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared it with that of other fluoro-quinolones and some unrelated  antimicrobials. lomefloxacin was very active against enterobacteriaceae (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) with activity comparable to that of ofloxacin (mic90, 0.25 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was moderately active against isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), and again the activity was comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml) but was eightfold less than ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was also active against isolates of staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 1 micrograms/ml), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, and this activity was most comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was fourfold less active than either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin against isolates of enterococcus faecalis (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml) and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). in common with ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin was very active against isolates of neisseria spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), haemophilus spp. (mic90, less  than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), legionella spp. (mic90, less than or equal  to 0.06 micrograms/ml), vibrio spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), and campylobacter jejuni (mic90, 1 microgram/ml). lomefloxacin showed poor activity against isolates of bacteroides spp. (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml) or clostridium difficile mic90, 32 micrograms/ml) and was only moderately active against isolates of clostridium perfringens (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), peptostreptococcus spp. (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), chlamydia trachomatis (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), mycoplasma hominis (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), and urea-plasma urealyticum (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was found to be bactericidal at concentrations generally close to the mic with greater than 3 log10 reduction in viability of exponentially dividing cultures of escherichia coli and s. aureus within 5 hr of exposure to concentrations at eight times the mic. these results indicate a potential clinical role for lomefloxacin in the treatment of genitourinary tract infections caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respiratory tract infections  caused by susceptible organisms, and soft tissue infections caused by s. aureus.

TI  == coumamidines, new broad spectrum antibiotics of the cinodine type. iii. microbiologic activity of coumamidine gamma 1.
AB  == the coumamidines are novel antibiotics with activity against a wide spectrum of aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. all microbiological studies were performed on coumamidine gamma 1. the mic90s (micrograms/ml) of coumamidine  are as follows: staphylococcus aureus 1.0, streptococcus pyogenes 8, enterobacteriaceae 2.0, pseudomonas aeruginosa 8, campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli 1, legionella pneumophila 8, haemophilus influenzae 0.5, neisseria gonorrhoeae 0.5. coumamidine had mics ranging from 8 to greater 0.5, neisseria gonorrhoeae 0.5. coumamidine had mics ranging from 8 to greater than 64 for most anaerobes, except some peptostreptococcus strains. the aminoglycoside super-sensitive strain, p. aeruginosa bmh 10, was also super-sensitive to coumamidine (mic 0.2 micrograms/ml). coumamidine was rapidly bactericidal for s.  aureus. the viable bacterial count in logarithmic phase cultures was reduced to less than 10 cfu within 2 hours after exposure to 4 times the mic (3.12 micrograms/ml) of coumamidine. the frequency of resistance development was less than 1 x 10(-9) for escherichia coli and s. aureus when selected at 4 and 8 times the mic. the cmax in mouse serum after a single subcutaneous dose of 25 mg/kg of  coumamidine was 4.5 micrograms/ml and t1/2 was 1 hour. coumamidine is stable in serum. in mouse protection tests against s. aureus nctc 10649 the ed50 was less than 0.6 mg/kg/day when it was administered subcutaneously at 1 and 5 hours after infection. coumamidine was not absorbed after oral administration. the antibacterial spectrum, bactericidal activity, stability in serum and low frequency of resistance make this an interesting new class of antibiotics.
