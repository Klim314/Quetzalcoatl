TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from brazilian water buffalo mozzarella cheese.
AB  == the water buffalo mozzarella cheese is a typical italian cheese which has been introduced in the thriving brazilian market in the last 10 y, with good acceptance by its consumers. lactic acid bacteria (lab) play an important role in the technological and sensory quality of mozzarella cheese. in this study, the aim was to evaluate the diversity of the autochthones viable lab isolated from water buffalo mozzarella cheese under storage. samples were collected in 3 independent trials in a dairy industry located in the southeast region of brazil, on the 28th day of storage, at 4 masculinec. the lab were characterized by gram staining, catalase test, capacity to assimilate citrate, and production of co2 from glucose. the diversity of lab was evaluated by rapd-pcr (randomly amplified  polymorphic dna-polymerase chain reaction), 16s rrna gene sequencing, and by vitek 2 system. twenty lab strains were isolated and clustered into 12 different  clusters, and identified as streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and lactobacillus helveticus. enterococcus species were dominant and  citrate-positive. only the strains of l. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and l. fermentum produced co2 from glucose and were citrate-positive, while l. casei  was only citrate positive. this is the first report which elucidates the lab diversity involved in brazilian water buffalo mozzarella cheese. furthermore, the results show that despite the absence of natural whey cultures as starters in production, the lab species identified are the ones typically found in mozzarella cheese.

TI  == use of probiotics to reduce faecal shedding of shiga toxin-producing escherichia  coli in sheep.
AB  == shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) are zoonotic, foodborne pathogens of humans. ruminants, including sheep, are the primary reservoirs of stec and there is a need to develop intervention strategies to reduce the entry of stec into the food chain. the initiation of the majority of bacterial, enteric infections involves colonisation of the gut mucosal surface by the pathogen. however, probiotic bacteria can serve to decrease the severity of infection via a number of mechanisms including competition for receptors and nutrients, and/or the synthesis of organic acids and bacteriocins that create an environment unfavourable for pathogen development. the aim of the current study was to determine whether the administration of a probiotic mixture to sheep experimentally infected with a non-o157 stec strain, carrying stx1, stx2 and eae  genes, was able to decrease faecal shedding of the pathogen. the probiotic mixture contained lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus and enterococcus faecium. the numbers of non-o157 stec in faecal samples collected from sheep receiving daily doses of the probiotic mixture were significantly lower at the 3rd, 5th and 6th week post-inoculation when compared to the levels recorded in untreated animals. it was concluded that administration of the probiotic mixture reduced faecal shedding of non-o157 stec in sheep, and holds potential as a pre-harvest intervention method to reduce transmission to humans.

TI  == taxonomic and molecular characterization of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in nunu, a ghanaian fermented milk product.
AB  == produced from raw unpasteurized milk, nunu is a spontaneously fermented yoghurt-like product made in ghana and other parts of west africa. despite the importance of nunu in the diet of many africans, there is currently only limited  information available on the microorganisms associated with nunu processing. with the aim of obtaining a deeper understanding of the process and as a first step towards developing starter cultures with desired technological properties for nunu production, a microbiological characterization of nunu processing in three different towns in the upper east region of ghana, namely bolgatanga, paga and navrongo, was carried out. lactic acid bacteria (lab) and yeasts associated with  nunu processing were isolated and identified using a combination of pheno- and genotypic methods including morphological and carbohydrate fermentation tests, (gtg)5-based rep-pcr, multiplex pcr, and 16s and 26s rrna gene sequencing. the lab counts during nunu processing increased from 4.5 +/- 0.4 log cfu/ml at 0 h to 8.7 +/- 1.8 log cfu/ml at 24 h of fermentation while yeasts counts increased from 2.8 +/- 1.2 log cfu/ml at 0 h to 5.8 +/- 0.5 log cfu/ml by the end of fermentation. lactobacillus fermentum was the dominant lab throughout the fermentations with lactobacillus plantarum and leuconostoc mesenteroides playing  prominent roles during the first 6-8 h of fermentation as well. less frequently isolated lab included lactobacillus helveticus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus italicus, weissella confusa and a putatively novel lactococcus spp.  the yeasts involved were identified as candida parapsilosis, candida rugosa, candida tropicalis, galactomyces geotrichum, pichia kudriavzevii and saccharomyces cerevisiae with p. kudriavzevii and s. cerevisiae being the dominant yeast species.

TI  == screening for lactic acid bacteria capable of inhibiting campylobacter jejuni in  in vitro simulations of the broiler chicken caecal environment.
AB  == thermotolerant campylobacter spp., specifically campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli, are the most common bacterial causes of human gastroenteritis in developed countries. consumption of improperly prepared poultry products and cross contamination are among the main causes of human campylobacteriosis. the aim of this study was to identify lactic acid bacterial (lab) strains capable of  inhibiting c. jejuni growth in initial in vitro trials ('spot-on-lawn' method), as well as in batch fermentation studies mimicking the broiler caecal environment. these experiments served as an indication for using these strains to decrease the capability of campylobacter to colonise and grow in the chicken caeca during primary production, with the aim of reducing the number of human campylobacteriosis cases. a total of 1,150 lab strains were screened for anti-campylobacter activity. six strains were selected: members of the species lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus agilis, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus salivarius, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium. after treatment with catalase, proteinase k and a-chymotrypsin, anti-campylobacter activity of cell-free culture supernatant fluid (csf) for all six strains was retained, which indicated that activity was probably not exerted by bacteriocin production. based on the activity found in csf, the compounds produced by the selected strains are secreted and do not require presence of live bacterial producer cells for activity. during initial in vitro fermentation experiments, the e. faecalis strain exhibited the highest inhibitory activity for c. jejuni and was selected for further fermentation experiments. in these experiments we tested for therapeutic or protective effects of the e. faecalis strain against c. jejuni mb 4185 infection under simulated broiler caecal growth conditions. the best inhibition results were obtained when e. faecalis was inoculated before the  c. jejuni strain, lowering c. jejuni counts at least one log compared to a positive control. this effect was already observed 6 h after c. jejuni inoculation.

TI  == a potential synbiotic product improves the lipid profile of diabetic rats.
AB  == background: previous studies showed that intake of yacon or some lactic acid bacteria was able to inhibit the development of diabetes mellitus, by reducing glucose and associated symptoms, for example, the lipid profile. objective: the purpose of this study was to assess the consumption influence of a potential symbiotic product of soybean and yacon extract and fermented enterococcus faecium crl 183 and lactobacillus helveticus ssp jugurti 416 in reducing blood glucose and lipid levels in an animal model. methods: diabetes mellitus was chemically induced by intraperitoneal administration of streptozotocin (50 mg/kg body weight). the rats were divided into four groups (n=10): gi - non-diabetic animals that received only a standard chow diet (negative control), gii - diabetic animals that received only chow diet (positive control), giii - diabetic animals  that received the chow diet + 1 ml/kg body weight/day of soybean and yacon unfermented product, giv - diabetic rats that received the chow diet + 1 ml/kg body weight/day of soybean and yacon fermented product. there was a seven-week treatment period and the following parameters were evaluated: animal body weight, food and water intake, blood glucose, enzyme activities of aspartate aminotransferase (ast) and alanine aminotransferase (alt), triglycerides levels,  total cholesterol, hdl-c, non-hdl-c. cell viability of the fermented product was  checked weekly for a seven-week period. results: the product average viable population was 10(8)-10(9) cfu/ml, by ensuring both the rods and cocci regular intake. no difference was observed between the water and feed intake and body weight of groups that received unfermented and fermented products and the untreated diabetic group. the same was observed for the blood glucose and ast and alt activities, while some improvement was observed for a lipid profile, represented by reduction of triglycerides level by 15.07% and 33.50% in groups iii and iv, respectively, and an increase of 23.70% in hdl-c level for group iv.  conclusion: the results showed that the ingestion of a potential symbiotic product was neither able to promote improvement in some of the disease symptoms,  nor reduce blood glucose. however, a positive effect on triglycerides levels and  hdl-cholesterol was observed in the groups that received the unfermented product  containing yacon extract and the fermented product with enterococcus faecium crl  183, as well as lactobacillus helveticus ssp jugurti 416 and yacon extract (symbiotic product).

TI  == a soy-based product fermented by enterococcus faecium and lactobacillus helveticus inhibits the development of murine breast adenocarcinoma.
AB  == purpose: soy and its fermented products are considered functional foods. the study objective was to assess three functional food - a non-fermented soy product (nfp), fermented soy product (fsp), fermented soy product enriched with isoflavones (fi) - in terms of their ability to reduce the development of adenocarcinoma in mice, as well their ability on modulating immune system. methods: it was observed tumor volume and to verify correlations with the immune  system it was measured levels of the cytokines il-1beta and tnf-alpha produced by macrophages as well as ifn-gamma produced by lymphocytes using elisa test, and nitric oxide production by macrophages using griess reagent. results: all products showed immunological activity, but fsp showed the most effective tumor containment, resulting in smallest tumor volumes. fi animals expressed larger amounts of nitric oxide and il-1beta and exhibited larger tumor sizes than fsp and nfp animals. conclusions: the results suggested that the ingestion of fsp was most efficient in tumor containment, possibly due to a positive modulation of the immune system by when enterococcus faecium and lactobacillus helveticus are added to the soy product.

TI  == influence of a probiotic soy product on fecal microbiota and its association with cardiovascular risk factors in an animal model.
AB  == background: previous work showed that daily ingestion of an aqueous soy extract fermented with enterococcus faecium crl 183 and lactobacillus helveticus 416, supplemented or not with isoflavones, reduced the total cholesterol and non-hdl-cholesterol levels, increased the high-density lipoprotein (hdl) concentration and inhibited the raising of autoantibody against oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-ldl ab) and the development of atherosclerotic lesions. objective: the aim of this study was to characterize the fecal microbiota in order to investigate the possible correlation between fecal microbiota, serum lipid parameters and atherosclerotic lesion development in rabbits with induced hypercholesterolemia, that ingested the aqueous soy extract  fermented with enterococcus faecium crl 183 and lactobacillus helveticus 416. methods: the rabbits were randomly allocated to five experimental groups (n = 6): control (c), hypercholesterolemic (h), hypercholesterolemic plus unfermented soy  product (huf), hypercholesterolemic plus fermented soy product (hf) and hypercholesterolemic plus isoflavone-supplemented fermented soy product (hif). lipid parameters and microbiota composition were analyzed on days 0 and 60 of the treatment and the atherosclerotic lesions were quantified at the end of the experiment. the fecal microbiota was characterized by enumerating the lactobacillus spp., bifidobacterium spp., enterococcus spp., enterobacteria and clostridium spp. populations. results: after 60 days of the experiment, intake of the probiotic soy product was correlated with significant increases (p < 0.05) on lactobacillus spp., bifidobacterium spp. and enterococcus spp. and a decrease in  the enterobacteria population. a strong correlation was observed between microbiota composition and lipid profile. populations of enterococcus spp., lactobacillus spp. and bifidobacterium spp. were negatively correlated with total cholesterol, non-hdl-cholesterol, autoantibodies against oxidized ldl (oxldl ab)  and lesion size. hdl-c levels were positively correlated with lactobacillus spp., bifidobacterium spp., and enterococcus spp. populations. conclusion: in conclusion, daily ingestion of the probiotic soy product, supplemented or not with isoflavones, may contribute to a beneficial balance of the fecal microbiota  and this modulation is associated with an improved cholesterol profile and inhibition of atherosclerotic lesion development.

TI  == isolation of cultivable thermophilic lactic acid bacteria from cheeses made with  mesophilic starter and molecular comparison with dairy-related lactobacillus helveticus strains.
AB  == aims: to isolate cultivable thermophilic lactic acid bacteria from cheeses made with mesophilic starter and compare them with dairy-related lactobacillus helveticus strains using molecular typing methods. methods and results: the number of thermophilic bacteria in seven commercial cheeses manufactured with mesophilic starters was estimated to be <10 cfu g(-1). implementation of an enumeration step in the isolation method made it possible to isolate one thermophilic strain from each of five of seven cheeses. comparing repetitive sequence pcr (rep-pcr) profiles of the isolates with dairy-related lact. helveticus strains indicated that one isolate was a lact. helveticus. partial sequencing of 16s rrna confirmed this, and the remaining four strains were identified as lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum and enterococcus faecium. the rep-pcr profile of the isolated lact. helveticus was identical to the rep-pcr profile of the lact. helveticus adjunct culture used in the specific  cheese, but their pulsed field gel electrophoresis profiles differed slightly. conclusion: it was possible to isolate cultivable thermophilic bacteria from ripened cheeses manufactured with mesophilic starter and thermophilic adjunct cultures by using an enumeration step. significance and impact of the study: isolation of cultivable thermophilic bacteria from ripened cheeses made with mesophilic starters offers an original source for new dairy-relevant cultures.

TI  == main microorganisms involved in the fermentation of ugandan ghee.
AB  == ghee is widely produced from a traditional fermented butter-like product named mashita in western uganda. however, no detailed studies have been done to identify the microorganisms involved in mashita fermentation. the aim of this study was to identify the microorganisms present at the end of mashita ripening using culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. the most commonly identified species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in mashita using culture-dependent techniques were lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus perolens constituting 37.3%, 10.1%, 8.1% and 7.7% of total bacterial colonies isolated respectively. l. paracasei was the only bacterial species identified in all mashita samples by culture-dependent technique. two of the four most commonly isolated lab species (l. helveticus and l. plantarum) were also identified in mashita by a culture-independent method (pcr-dgge). other main lab species identified in mashita by pcr-dgge were bifidobacterium sp., enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus acetotolerans, lactobacillus sp., lactococcus raffinolactis, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and streptococcus salivarius. the main species of acetic acid bacteria (aab) identified in the mashita using pcr-dgge method were acetobacter aceti, acetobacter lovaniensis, acetobacter orientalis and acetobacter pasteurianus. pcr-dgge identification of yeasts showed that brettanomyces custersianus, candida silvae, geotrichum sp., issatchenkia occidentalis, issatchenkia orientalis, kluyveromyces marxianus, saccharomyces cerevisiae, and trichosporon asahii were main yeast species in mashita. a. lovaniensis, a. aceti, and i. orientalis were identified in all the six mashita samples analyzed using pcr-dgge method. other microbial species were only found in some samples. these results indicate that lab and yeasts, as in similar fermentation products, but also aab are main microbial groups involved in mashita fermentation.

TI  == biogenic amine-forming microbial communities in cheese.
AB  == the aim of this study was to screen two cheese starter cultures and cheese-borne  microbial communities with the potential to produce biogenic amines in cheese during ripening. bacteria of the genera enterococcus and lactobacillus and coliform bacteria were isolated from dutch-type semi-hard cheese at the beginning of the ripening period. statistically significant counts of bacterial isolates were screened for the presence of specific dna sequences coding for tyrosine decarboxylase (tyrdc) and histidine decarboxylase (hdc) enzymes. the pcr analysis of dna from 14 enterococcus and 3 lactobacillus isolates confirmed the presence of the targetted dna sequences. simultaneously, 13 tyrdc- and 3 hdc-positive isolates were grown in decarboxylase screening medium and this was followed by hplc analysis of the produced tyramine and histamine. conventional and molecular  taxonomic analyses of the above-mentioned isolates identified the following species: enterococcus durans (7 strains), enterococcus faecalis (3 strains), enterococcus faecium (1 strain), enterococcus casseliflavus (3 strains), lactobacillus curvatus (1 strain), lactobacillus lactis (1 strain) and lactobacillus helveticus (1 strain). all of the above enterococcus and two of the lactobacillus strains originated from contaminating microbial communities. the l. helveticus strain, which was tyrosine decarboxylase-positive and exhibited tyramine production, originated from starter culture 1 used for cheese production. comparison of partial tyrdc sequences of positive enterococcus isolates revealed 89% sequence similarity, and that of hdc-positive lactobacillus isolates revealed 99% sequence similarity.

TI  == redox potential to discriminate among species of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == aims: to verify to what degree reducing capacity is a characterizing parameter of a species, and of the strains themselves within a given species, of lactic acid bacteria. methods and results: eighty-eight strains belonging to 10 species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from traditional italian cheeses were studied for their reduction activity: enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis,  lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus helveticus and pediococcus pentosaceus. it was observed that the lactococci reached minimum redox potential  before the lactobacilli. the reduction rate of enterococcus spp. and l. lactis ssp. lactis was higher than that of the streptococci and lactobacillus spp. all the p. pentosaceus strains had poor reduction activity compared with the other species. conclusions: the evolution of the redox potential in milk over a time span of 24 h has been found to be a parameter that characterizes a species: the different courses corresponding to the species in question are clearly evident, and interesting differences can also be noted within the same species. significance and impact of the study: the reduction aptitude of strains might be  used to select and adapt appropriate strains for use as starters for dairy products.

TI  == evaluation in vitro of the antagonistic substances produced by lactobacillus spp. isolated from chickens.
AB  == to determine the inhibitory capacity of lactic acid bacteria due to the action of antagonistic substances, we tested 474 isolates of lactobacillus from the crop and cecum of chickens against gram-positive and gram-negative indicator microorganisms by the spot-on-the-lawn and well-diffusion antagonism methods. of  the 474 isolates, 265 demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the indicator microorganisms. isolates identified as l. reuteri, l. salivarius, or lactobacillus spp. inhibited enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, listeria monocytogenes, and salmonella spp. but not l. casei, l. delbrueckii, l. fermentum, or l. helveticus by the well-diffusion simultaneous antagonism method  under anaerobic incubation conditions. the antagonistic substances produced by some of the lactobacillus isolates were inactivated after treatment by proteolytic enzymes, which suggested that the substances could be antimicrobial peptides or bacteriocins.

TI  == rapid identification of dairy lactic acid bacteria by m13-generated, rapd-pcr fingerprint databases.
AB  == about a thousand lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific pcr and rapd-pcr, respectively. rapd-pcr profiles, which were obtained by using the m13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by bionumerics software. cluster analysis of the combined rapd-pcr fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library,  which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. a library unit, in this case, can be considered  to be a definable taxon. the strains belonged to 11 main rapd-pcr fingerprinting  library units identified as lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus lactis. the possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. the proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful lab strain collection. the same approach could also be applied to identify lab strains isolated from other food ecosystems.

TI  == mur-lh, the broad-spectrum endolysin of lactobacillus helveticus temperate bacteriophage phi-0303.
AB  == phi-0303 is a temperate bacteriophage isolated from lactobacillus helveticus cnrz 303 strain after mitomycin c induction. in this work, the gene coding for a lytic protein of this bacteriophage was cloned using a library of phi-0303 in escherichia coli dh5alpha. the lytic activity was detected by its expression, using whole cells of the sensitive strain l. helveticus cnrz 892 as the substrate. the lysin gene was within a 4.1-kb dna fragment of phi-0303 containing six open reading frames (orfs) and two truncated orfs. no sequence homology with  holin genes was found within the cloned fragment. an integrase-encoding gene was  also present in the fragment, but it was transcribed in a direction opposite that of the lysin gene. the lysin-encoding lys gene was verified by pcr amplification  from the total phage dna and subcloned. the lys gene is a 1,122-bp sequence encoding a protein of 373 amino acids (mur-lh), whose product had a deduced molecular mass of 40,207 da. comparisons with sequences in sequence databases showed homology with numerous endolysins of other bacteriophages. mur-lh was expressed in e. coli bl21, and by renaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with l. helveticus cnrz 892 as the substrate, the recombinant protein showed an apparent molecular mass of 40 kda. the n-terminal sequence of the protein confirmed the start codon. hydrolysis of cell walls of l. helveticus cnrz 303 by the endolysin and biochemical analysis of the residues produced demonstrated that mur-lh has n-acetylmuramidase activity. last, the endolysin exhibited a broad spectrum of lytic activity, as it was active on different species, mainly thermophilic lactobacilli but also lactococci, pediococci, bacillus subtilis, brevibacterium linens, and enterococcus faecium.

AB  == sodium caseinates prepared from bovine, sheep, goat, pig, buffalo or human milk were hydrolyzed by a partially purified proteinase of lactobacillus helveticus pr4. peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. the fractions which showed the highest angiotensin i-converting-enzyme (ace)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and edman degradation analyses. various ace-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine alpha(s1)-casein (alpha(s1)-cn) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and beta-cn f58-76; ovine alpha(s1)-cn f1-6 and alpha(s2)-cn f182-185 and f186-188; caprine beta-cn f58-65  and alpha(s2)-cn f182-187; buffalo beta-cn f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human beta-cn. a mixture of peptides with a c-terminal sequence, pro-gly-pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. the highest ace-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ace inhibitor (s)-n-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 micro g/ml (100 micro mol/liter). several of the above sequences had features in  common with other ace-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. the 50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 micro g/ml). some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ace-inhibitory activity and ic(50)s were confirmed. an antibacterial peptide corresponding to beta-cn f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. it showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as enterococcus faecium, bacillus megaterium, escherichia coli, listeria innocua, salmonella spp., yersinia enterocolitica, and staphylococcus aureus. the mic for e. coli f19 was ca. 50 micro g/ml. once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of l. helveticus pr4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.

TI  == extracellular arginine aminopeptidase from streptococcus gordonii fss2.
AB  == streptococcus gordonii is a primary etiological agent in the development of subacute bacterial endocarditis (sbe), producing thrombus formation and tissue damage on the surfaces of heart valves. this is ironic, considering its normal role as a benign inhabitant of the oral microflora. however, strain fss2 of s. gordonii has been found to produce several extracellular aminopeptidase- and fibrinogen-degrading activities during growth in a ph-controlled batch culture. in this report, we describe the purification, characterization, and partial cloning of a predicted serine class arginine aminopeptidase (rap) with some cysteine class characteristics. isolation of this enzyme by anion-exchange, gel filtration, and isoelectric focusing chromatography yielded a protein monomer of  approximately 70 kda, as shown by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization, gel filtration, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. nested-pcr cloning enabled the isolation of a 324-bp-long dna fragment encoding the 108-amino-acid n terminus of rap. culture activity profiles and n-terminal sequence analysis indicated the export of this protein from the cell surface. homology was found with a putative dipeptidase from streptococcus pyogenes and nonspecific dipeptidases from lactobacillus helveticus and lactococcus lactis. we believe that rap may serve as a critical factor for arginine acquisition during nutrient stress in vivo and also in the proteolysis of host proteins and peptides during sbe pathology.

TI  == [the antagonistic properties of bacteria isolated from the digestive tract of female mink housed in the area of the chernobyl atomic electric power station].
AB  == differences in species composition, number and level of antagonistic activity of  bacteria isolated from the digestive tract of chernobyl female minks of various age and with different immunological state have been established. prevalence of anaerobes (bifidobacteria) and microaerophils (lactic acid bacteria) with the increase of microorganisms concentration along the channel: stomach, small and large intestine (10(7)-10(10)/g) was found in all the departments of digestive tract of minks. among the identified lactic-acid bacteria lactobacillus helveticus (10(7)-10(8)/g) prevailed in the stomach of the studied female minks,  l. coryniformis (10(9)-10(10)/g) in the small intestine, l. casei (10(10)/g) in the large one. antagonistic activity was most expressed in the strains of l. helveticus and l. casei, isolated from the younger (1.5 year-old) minks. enterococcus faecalis isolated from the stomach of 1.5 year-old female minks was  distinguished by the greatest antagonistic activity among identified enterococci. strains of e. faecium isolated from the thin intestine of the young female minks  (1.5 year-old) and from the large intestine of more nature animals (2.5 years) who received thymogen were characterized by the most expressed antibiosis among enterococci isolated bacteria a conclusion was made that the mechanisms of inhibitory effect of the studied microorganisms are underlied by not only their capacity to form organic acids but also by the capacity to produce antibiotic products.

TI  == development of rapd protocol for typing of strains of lactic acid bacteria and enterococci.
AB  == a protocol for typing strains of lactic acid bacteria and enterococci based on randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) fragments has been developed. using a single 10-mer primer, fingerprints were achieved without the need to isolate genomic dna. different conditions of dna release and amplification were investigated in order to obtain reproducible results and high discrimination among strains. this rapd protocol was successfully applied for the typing of strains belonging to the species lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. helveticus, lact. casei, lact. reuteri, lact. plantarum, enterococcus faecalis, ent. faecium  and streptococcus thermophilus.
