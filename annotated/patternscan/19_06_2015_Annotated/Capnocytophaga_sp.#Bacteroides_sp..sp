TI  == subgingival microbial profiles of smokers with periodontitis.
AB  == the subgingival microbiome is largely uncultivated, and therefore, cultivation-based and targeted molecular approaches have limited value in examining the effect of smoking on this community. we tested the hypothesis that  the subgingival biofilm is compositionally different in current and never-smokers by using an open-ended molecular approach for bacterial identification. subgingival plaque from deep sites of current and never-smokers matched for disease was analyzed by 16s sequencing. smokers demonstrated greater abundance of parvimonas, fusobacterium, campylobacter, bacteroides, and treponema and lower levels of veillonella, neisseria, and streptococcus. several uncultivated peptostreptococci, parvimonas micra, campylobacter gracilis, treponema socranskii, dialister pneumosintes, and tannerella forsythia were elevated in this group, while veillonella sp. oral clone b2, neisseria sp. oral clone 2.24, streptococcus sanguinis, and capnocytophaga sp. clone ah015 were at lower levels. the microbial profile of smoking-associated periodontitis is distinct from that of non-smokers, with significant differences in the prevalence and abundance of disease-associated and health-compatible organisms.

TI  == mechanical non-surgical treatment of peri-implantitis: a single-blinded randomized longitudinal clinical study. ii. microbiological results.
AB  == background: peri-implantitis is common in patients with dental implants. we performed a single-blinded longitudinal randomized study to assess the effects of mechanical debridement on the peri-implant microbiota in peri-implantitis lesions. materials and methods: an expanded checkerboard dna-dna hybridization assay encompassing 79 different microorganisms was used to study bacterial counts before and during 6 months following mechanical treatment of peri-implantitis in  17 cases treated with curettes and 14 cases treated with an ultrasonic device. statistics included non-parametric tests and glm multivariate analysis with p<0001 indicating significance and 80% power. results: at selected implant test sites, the most prevalent bacteria were: fusobacterium nucleatum sp., staphylococci sp., aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, helicobacter pylori, and tannerella forsythia. 30 min. after treatment with curettes, a. actinomycetemcomitans (serotype a), lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus anginosus, and veillonella parvula were found at lower counts (p<0.001). no such  differences were found for implants treated with the ultrasonic device. inconsistent changes occurred following the first week. no microbiological differences between baseline and 6-month samples were found for any species or between treatment study methods in peri-implantitis. conclusions: both methods failed to eliminate or reduce bacterial counts in peri-implantitis. no group differences were found in the ability to reduce the microbiota in peri-implantitis.

TI  == comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (rp) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (grs = good responders) or periodontal health (ph) using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: at baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with ph and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim. the subjects with periodontitis were classified as having rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or more than three sites with al >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or  as grs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >or=2.5 mm after treatment. significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis and chi(2) tests. results: more species were detected in patients with disease (gr or rp) than in those without disease (ph). subjects with rp were distinguished from grs or those with ph by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum, selenomonas noxia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., treponema spp., and eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (pseudoramibacter alactolyticus,  tm7 spp. oral taxon [ot] 346/356, bacteroidetes sp. ot 272/274, solobacterium moorei, desulfobulbus sp. ot 041, brevundimonas diminuta, sphaerocytophaga sp. ot 337, shuttleworthia satelles, filifactor alocis, dialister invisus/pneumosintes,  granulicatella adiacens, mogibacterium timidum, veillonella atypica, mycoplasma salivarium, synergistes sp. cluster ii, and acidaminococcaceae [g-1] sp. ot 132/150/155/148/135) (p <0.05). species that were more prevalent in subjects with ph than in patients with periodontitis included actinomyces sp. ot 170, actinomyces spp. cluster i, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, lautropia mirabilis, propionibacterium propionicum, rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and streptococcus sanguinis (p <0.05). conclusion: as determined by homim, patients with rp presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the gr and ph groups.

TI  == microbiological findings in subjects with asymptomatic oral lichen planus: a cross-sectional comparative study.
AB  == background: the bacterial colonization of the oral mucosa was evaluated in patients with asymptomatic oral lichen planus (olp) and compared to the microbiologic status in mucosally healthy subjects. methods: bacteria from patients with clinically and histopathologically diagnosed olp from the stomatology service, department of oral surgery and stomatology, school of dental medicine, university of bern, were collected with a non-invasive swab system. samples were taken from olp lesions on the gingiva and from non-affected sites on the contralateral side of the mouth. the control population did not have olp and  was recruited from the student clinic. all samples were processed with the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method using well-defined bacterial species for the analysis. results: significantly higher bacterial counts of bacteroides ureolyticus (p = 0.001), dialister species (sp.) (p = 0.006), staphylococcus haemolyticus (p = 0.007), and streptococcus agalactiae (p = 0.006) were found in  samples taken from olp lesions compared to sites with no clinical evidence of olp. significantly higher bacterial counts were found for capnocytophaga sputigena, eikenella corrodens, lactobacillus crispatus, mobiluncus curtisii, neisseria mucosa, prevotella bivia, prevotella intermedia, and s. agalactiae at sites with lesions in subjects with olp compared to sites in control subjects (p  <0.001). conclusions: microbiologic differences were found between sites with olp and sites in subjects without a diagnosis of olp. specifically, higher counts of  staphylococci and s. agalactiae were found in olp lesions.

TI  == microbiological evaluation of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without sinus tract.
AB  == aim: to examine the microbiological status of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without a sinus tract. methodology: samples were collected by means of a size 15 h-type file and two sterile paper points from 30 cases of primary endodontic infections with (n = 15) or without (n = 15) a sinus tract. the presence of 40 bacterial species was determined by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. results: the species found at the highest levels and prevalence were fusobacterium nucleatum sp. vincentii, porphyromonas gingivalis,  veillonella parvula, enterococcus faecalis, campylobacter gracilis and neisseria  mucosa. total bacterial counts were similar between teeth with (44 x 10(5)) and without (50 x 10(5)) a sinus tract (t-test: p > 0.05). e. faecalis, streptococcus anginosus, capnocytophaga sputigena and capnocytophaga gingivalis had significantly higher counts in the absence of sinus tract (mann-whitney test, p < 0.05). higher levels of p. gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum were observed in cases with a sinus tract. leptotrichia buccalis (or = 1.83; ci 95%) and porphyromonas endodontalis (or = 2.15; ci 95%) were associated with an increased chance of subjects having a sinus tract. conclusions: primary endodontic infections were associated with a large variety of bacterial species.  specific differences between the composition of the microbiota of primary root canal infections were observed in cases with or without a sinus tract.

TI  == localized aggressive periodontitis in primary dentition: a case report.
AB  == background: a 5-year-old japanese boy presented with persistent gingival inflammation and severe mobility of the right lower primary incisors. due to severe alveolar bone loss and a deep periodontal pocket (5 mm), the incisors were extracted at the second visit. methods: clinical, radiographic, histological, and microbiological examinations were carried out. then, the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) technique was employed to detect specific periodontal pathogens. the chemotactic activity of polymorphonuclear neutrophils was also measured. results: tannerella, capnocytophaga, fusobacterium, and eikenella sp. were recovered from the subgingival microflora around the right lower incisors, while  a. actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis (formerly bacteroides forsythus), prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, and capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected using the pcr method. further chemotaxis assay revealed  that neutrophil function was depressed compared with that of healthy controls. conclusions: although inflammation remained around the right primary second molars, the bone loss was controlled by periodic professional mechanical teeth cleaning (pmtc), subgingival irrigation, and local antibiotic application. the probing depths of all teeth, including permanent incisors and molars, were within 2.5 mm.

TI  == the effect of scaling and root planing on the clinical and microbiological parameters of periodontal diseases: 12-month results.
AB  == background/aims: previously, we reported that srp resulted in a decrease in mean  pocket depth and attachment level and reduced prevalence and levels of bacteroidesforsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and treponema denticola at 3 and  6 months post-srp in 57 subjects with adult periodontitis. 32 of the 57 subjects  were monitored at 9 and 12 months. thus, the purpose of the present investigation was to evaluate the microbial and clinical effects of srp in 32 (mean age 48+/-11) subjects over a 12-month period. method: clinical assessments of plaque, gingival redness, suppuration, bleeding on probing, pocket depth and attachment level were made prior to srp and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-therapy. subgingival plaque samples were taken at each visit and analyzed using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique for the presence and levels of 40 subgingival species. each subject also received maintenance scaling at each of the subsequent monitoring visits. differences in clinical parameters and prevalence and levels of bacterial species were analyzed pre- and post-therapy using the wilcoxon signed ranks test. the quade test for related samples was used for analysis of multiple visits. results: mean pocket depth (mm+/-sem) decreased  from 3.2+/-0.3 at baseline to 2.9+/-0.3 at 12 months (p<0.01). mean attachment level showed significant reduction at 6 months, but did not diminish further. bleeding on probing and plaque were significantly reduced at 12 months (p<0.001,  p<0.05, respectively). p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and t. denticola decreased in  prevalence and levels up to the 6-month visit and remained at these lower levels  at 9 and 12 months. significant increases in levels and prevalence were noted at  12 months for actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, actinomyces odontolyticus, fusobacterium nucleatum ss polymorphum, streptococcus mitis, capnocytophaga sp, and veillonella parvula. conclusions: the data suggest that the maintenance phase of therapy may be essential in consolidating clinical and microbiological improvements achieved as a result of initial therapy.

TI  == coenonia anatina gen. nov., sp. nov., a novel bacterium associated with respiratory disease in ducks and geese.
AB  == taxon 1502 was originally described as a riemerella anatipestifer-like bacterium  causing exudative septicaemia in ducks and geese. in the present study, an integrated genotypic and phenotypic approach was used to elucidate the phylogenetic affiliation and taxonomic relationships of 12 strains of taxon 1502. whole-cell protein and fatty acid analyses and an extensive biochemical examination by using conventional tests and several api microtest systems indicated that all isolates formed a homogeneous taxon, which was confirmed by dna-dna hybridizations. 16s rdna sequence analysis of a representative strain (lmg 14382t) indicated that this taxon belongs to the cytophaga-flavobacterium-bacteroides phylum and revealed a moderate but distinct  relationship to species of the genus capnocytophaga (overall 16s rdna sequence identities were 88.8-90.2%). taxon 1502 is concluded to represent a single species that should be allocated to a novel genus, and the name coenonia anatina  gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. the dna g + c content of representative strains  was 35-36 mol% and the type strain is lmg 14382t.

TI  == comparison of randomly cloned and whole genomic dna probes for the detection of porphyromonas gingivalis and bacteroides forsythus.
AB  == whole genomic and randomly-cloned dna probes for two fastidious periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis and bacteroides forsythus were labeled with digoxigenin and detected by a colorimetric method. the specificity and sensitivity of the whole genomic and cloned probes were compared. the cloned probes were highly specific compared to the whole genomic probes. a significant degree of cross-reactivity with bacteroides species, capnocytophaga sp. and prevotella sp. was observed with the whole genomic probes. the cloned probes were less sensitive than the whole genomic probes and required at least 10(6) target cells or a minimum of 10 ng of target dna to be detected during hybridization. although a ten-fold increase in sensitivity was obtained with the whole genomic probes, cross-hybridization to closely related species limits their reliability in identifying target bacteria in subgingival plaque samples.

TI  == ornithobacterium rhinotracheale gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from the avian respiratory tract.
AB  == the phylogenetic position and various genotypic, chemotaxonomic, and classical phenotypic characteristics of 21 gram-negative avian isolates were studied. these strains constitute a genotypically homogeneous taxon in rrna superfamily v, as shown by dna-rrna hybridization data. determination of the 16s rrna sequence of this taxon revealed its detailed position within the "flavobacter" subgroup of the "flavobacter-bacteroides" phylum as described by gherna and woese (r. gherna  and c. r. woese, syst. appl. microbiol. 15:513-521, 1992). this new taxon is only distantly related to other members of the "flavobacter-bacteroides" phylum and is therefore given separate generic status. the dna-dna binding values for members of this taxon, for which we propose the name ornithobacterium rhinotracheale, confirmed that all of the strains are highly interrelated (dna-dna binding values greater than 90% were measured). the g+c contents of members of this taxon are between 37 and 39 mol%. an analysis of the cellular proteins and fatty acids and  classical phenotypic characteristics allowed us to distinguish o. rhinotracheale  from phenotypically similar taxa, such as riemerella anatipestifer and capnocytophaga species. the respiratory quinone content (menaquinone 7) and carbohydrate pattern of o. rhinotracheale conform with the respiratory quinone contents and carbohydrate patterns of other members of rrna superfamily v.

TI  == dog-associated bacterial infections in humans: isolates submitted to an australian reference laboratory, 1981-1992.
AB  == over the period 1981-92, 32 bacterial isolates were referred to the microbiological diagnostic unit from infected dog-bite wounds and 10 isolates were submitted from blood cultures after dog bites or close contact with dogs. the isolates from the bite wounds were identified, or confirmed, as pasteurella multocida (11 isolates), pasteurella dagmatis (3), cdc group m-5 (9), cdc group ef-4a (8) and streptococcus anginosus (1). five of the 9 patients from whom cdc group m-5 was cultured had mixed infections: 2 with p. multocida one of which also had bacteroides sp., one with p. dagmatis, one with cdc group ef-4a and another with bacteroides sp. nine of the 10 blood isolates were identified as capnocytophaga canimorsus. the remaining one of streptobacillus moniliformis, which is typically associated with rat-bite fever, was the result of a bite from  a breed of dog (greyhound) that eats rodents. clinical notes are provided for infections caused by the more unusual bacterial isolates and their laboratory identification is described.

TI  == sub-gingival microflora in macaca mulatta species of rhesus monkey.
AB  == the macaca mulatta species of rhesus monkey is one of several non-human primate (nhp) models for periodontal disease. this report presents the bacteriology of the gingival sulci in m. mulatta monkeys. three sub-gingival sites (maxillary right central incisor, the disto-buccal of the mandibular left second molar and mesio-buccal of the mandibular right second molar) of 9 monkeys were evaluated clinically before scaling and 7 days after scaling. plaque samples were obtained  from sub-gingival sites before clinical examination and studied bacteriologically by dark field microscopy, selective and non-selective culture, and by primary phenotypic characterizations of culture isolates. several gingival sites presented with mild gingival inflammation. anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic  bacteria were the predominant flora colonizing the gingival sulci. the major microbial groups were haemophilus species (100% of sites; percentage of total anaerobic count (tac): 21-51), peptostreptococcus micros (89%, 7.5-29.5), actinomyces sp. (85%, 7-27), fusobacterium nucleatum (90%, 5-8), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (73%, 1.3-12), black-pigmented anaerobic rods (bpar) (80%,  0.6-6.5) and oral streptococci (80%, 0.2-1.0). microbial groups detected less often were wolinella sp. (66%, 0-2.6), capnocytophaga sp. (30%), eikenella corrodens (4.7%, 0), campylobacter sp. (28%, 0-0.1) and spirochetes (4.7%, 0-0.07). seven days after gingival sites were scaled, the plaque score and indices for gingival inflammation declined significantly. the gingival flora after scaling were characterized by lower proportions of the actinomyces sp., p.  micros and bpar; and increased proportions of the oral streptococci, relative to  pre-scaling levels.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == subgingival temperature (iii). relation to microbial counts.
AB  == the present investigation examined the relationship of selected bacterial species and subgingival temperature. 35 subjects were measured at 6 sites per tooth for clinical parameters and subgingival temperature. measurements were repeated for 21 subjects at 2 month intervals providing a total of 66 subjects visits. at each visit, subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth and anaerobically dispersed, diluted and plated on non-selective media. after anaerobic incubation, colonies were lifted to nylon filters and specific species  detected using digoxigenin-labeled whole chromosomal dna probes. species enumerated were; a. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes a and b, b. forsythus, b. gingivalis, b. intermedius i and ii, c. ochracea, f. nucleatum ss. vincentii, p.  micros, s. intermedius, s. sanguis i and ii, v. parvula and w. recta. total viable counts and counts of capnocytophaga sp. were determined directly from the  primary isolation plates. a total of 1581 samples were evaluated. subject visits  with higher mean subgingival temperatures had significantly higher mean %s of b.  intermedius i and p. micros, and lower mean %s of capnocytophaga sp. sites with higher subgingival temperatures had elevated proportions of b. intermedius i and  ii, a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a and b. gingivalis more frequently than sites with lower temperatures, while capnocytophaga sp. were elevated more often  at cooler sites. 43 of the subject visits had follow up attachment level measurements at 2 months. the 1026 microbial samples and the subgingival temperature measurements from these visits were related to longitudinal attachment change.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == dental bacterial plaques. nature and role in periodontal disease.
AB  == antony van leeuwenhoek first described oral bacteria. however, not until almost 200 years later was the famous koch postulate introduced. since then, research has extensively been performed regarding the development and microbiology of dental plaques. in spite of the complexity of the developing flora of supragingival plaque, culture studies have shown a remarkably orderly succession  of organisms. lately, the concept of microbial specificity in the etiology of periodontal diseases has been widely suggested, i.e., that different forms of periodontal disease are associated with qualitatively distinct dental plaques. cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of the predominant cultivable microflora reveal that only a small number of the over 300 species found in human subgingival plaques are associated with periodontal disease. among the commonly mentioned are: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, capnocytophaga sp., eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, and wolinella recta, as well as certain gram-positive bacteria such as eubacterium species. anti-infective therapy for many systemic infections equals the use of antimicrobial drugs. however, for localized infections like periodontal diseases, treatment may consist of a combination of mechanical wound  debridement and the application of an antimicrobial agent. the general effectiveness of mechanical anti-infective therapy and successful oral hygiene in the management of periodontal disease is well established in the literature and has met the test of success in clinical practice for most cases of periodontitis  in adults. the definition of periodontal pathogens as either opportunistic pathogens, or as exogenous pathogens carries with it significant implications.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == effects of chlorhexidine on proteolytic and glycosidic enzyme activities of dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == chlorhexidine was tested for its ability to inhibit a wide range of glycosidic and proteolytic enzyme activities produced by treponema denticola, porphyromonas  gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycemcomitans, capnocytophaga sputigena, capnocytophaga gingivalis, capnocytophaga orchracea, capnocytophaga sp., actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mitior, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sanguis. the enzymes produced by capnocytophaga spp. were the most resistant to inhibition by chlorhexidine while  the hydrolysis of proteolytic substrates by all the other species was markedly susceptible to inhibition with less than 0.125 mm chlorhexidine inhibiting enzyme activities by greater than or equal to 50%. glycosidase activities, of all species, were generally more resistant to inhibition, especially neuraminidase activity. chlorhexidine at less than 0.032 mm inhibited the degradation of bovine serum albumin by suspensions of dental plaque bacteria. these observations support an hypothesis that chlorhexidine exerts a bacteristatic effect in vivo, in part, by reducing the ability of dental plaque bacteria to degrade host-derived proteins and glycoproteins which normally provide essential nutrients for growth.

TI  == changes in subgingival microbiota during puberty. a 4-year longitudinal study.
AB  == it was the purpose of the present investigation to monitor the composition of the subgingival microbiota at selected sites in individuals passing through puberty and to correlate observed changes with the development of pubertal maturation. between the ages of 11 and 14 years, pubertal and skeletal maturation was monitored annually in 22 boys and 20 girls. during this time, subgingival microbial samples were taken every 4th to 5th month (10 times in 4 years) mesially of the upper first molars. high values in total bacterial counts were reached after the onset of puberty, followed by a decrease towards the end of the observation period. the frequency of detection of actinomyces odontolyticus and of capnocytophaga sp. increased with time. the frequencies of other selected species, specifically of black pigmenting bacteriodes sp. were not found to increase when tested by linear and quadratic models of time trend. however, a statistically significant rise in the frequency of detecting b. intermedius and b. melaninogenicus was noted in the initial pubertal phase identified by the onset of testicular growth in boys (p = 0.05). a significant relationship also existed between testes growth and increase of a. odontolyticus (p less than 0.01). in girls, a similar increase was obtained for a. odontolyticus when studied in relation to the tanner scores for breast development (p less than 0.01). the changes observed in the subgingival microbiota during puberty may be related to the development of gingivitis, which was demonstrated by a higher tendency for gingival bleeding during the course of the pubertal maturation process.

TI  == microbial changes associated with the development of puberty gingivitis.
AB  == in this study, longitudinal changes in the composition of the subgingival microbiota of children between the ages of 11 and 14 and their association with changes of clinical parameters describing gingival health were investigated. during 4 years, subgingival microbial samples were taken in 22 boys and 20 girls  10 times. at the same time the gingival bleeding tendency was recorded by the papillary bleeding index (pbi). a total of 840 samples was evaluated using darkfield microscopy and anaerobic culturing on non-selective and selective media. children, who developed a marked and sustained increase in mean pbi scores (n = 21), had higher frequencies and mean proportions of spirochetes and eikenella corrodens than children without pronounced puberty gingivitis (p less than = 0.05). the mean proportion of actinomyces viscosus was also higher in these children (p less than = 0.05). among the species discriminated, only capnocytophaga sp. were found at a higher rate in samples taken immediately before a rise of pbi (p less than = 0.05). the detection frequencies of black-pigmented bacteroides (particularly b. intermedius) increased later, and were significantly elevated after the establishment of a high bleeding tendency (p less than = 0.05). these findings implicate capnocytophaga sp. in the initiation of puberty gingivitis, whereas the increased presence of bacteroides may reflect a change in the subgingival environment secondary to increased bleeding.

TI  == microbial patterns in pooled subgingival plaque samples from young adults with advanced marginal periodontitis.
AB  == different bacterial profiles of subgingival plaque have been described for different clinical categories of marginal periodontitis. in the present investigation the subgingival microflora was studied in young adults with advanced marginal periodontitis. from 12 patients pooled subgingival plaque samples from 5 advanced stages of diseased sites were examined by direct differential phase-contrast microscopy and by cultivation on enriched and selective media. the proportions of the following genera and species were calculated: black-pigmented bacteroides sp., b. gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, veillonella sp., actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga  sp., eikenella corrodens, campylobacter sp., and candida sp. spirochete identification was carried out ultrastructurally. calculated percent minimum similarity levels between the individuals revealed that each patient harbored its characteristic cultivable subgingival microflora different from the other individuals. the spirochetes seemed to constitute the subgingival bacterial group with the smallest variation as certain morphotypes were dominating in almost all  individuals.

AB  == the aim of this study is to determine the method of maintenance care for support  the functional condition during long period. the present paper reports on the result of osseointegrated titanium fixture in four complete denture patients. the marginal soft tissue reactions were investigated at the 1st, 3rd, 6th, 12th and 18th month after prothetic restrations by clinical examination and microbiological observations. all abutments were surrounded by clinically in healthy gingiva, however most individuals with the implant fixture had used as a  complete denture for many years, without oral hygiene. for a favorable prognosis  of the implant-recipients, self plaque control should be acquired for the patients shortly after prothetic restration. before the healing phase, it is necessary to recall frequently for maintenance marginal soft tissue and prothetic restoration. after healing and remodeling phase, the interval of maintenance care was decided on each 3rd months. the interval seemed practically reasonable because the 18th month later the prognosis was satisfactory. this report presents two cases of complications during the maintenance phase of osseointegrated implants. case i: a 72-year-old female patient presented gingival hyperplasia formation around the abutment after 19th months on abutment setting. we performed excision of the hyperplastic gingiva and apically positioned flap. probing depth  (pd) could not be determined because of gingival hyperplasia formation before operation, but there was marking reduction of probing depth after operation. the  gingival bleeding index (gbi) was improved and the amount of gingival crevicular  fluid (gcf) was reduced after operation. in pre-operative anaerobic culture, the  proportions of capnocytophaga species and haemophilus actinomycetemcomitans were  found. post-operatively, capnocytophaga sp. was not found, but h. actinomycetemcomitans was unchanged. case ii: a 47-year-old male patient presented gingivitis around the abutment after 13th months on abutment setting. we performed cleaning of the abutment surface with the flap procedure. furthermore, a joint screw between the fixture and abutment was adapted due to loosening after operation, pd was unchanged, gbi was improved and gcf was slightly reduced. in pre-operative anaerobic culture, bacteroides intermedius was rich. post-operatively, b. intermedius was not found. in conclusion, we advocate  that maintenance care of osseointegrated implants is the most important factor in the procedure.

TI  == antimicrobial action of natural substances on oral bacteria.
AB  == the antimicrobial action of natural substances was investigated in vitro against  oral bacteria including streptococcus sp., actinomyces sp., actinobacillus sp., bacteroides sp., capnocytophaga sp., eikenella sp., fusobacterium sp. and propionibacterium sp. among the natural substances tested, hinokitiol was the most inhibitory to oral bacteria. cinnamon bark oil, papua-mace extracts, and clove bud oil in spice extracts were also inhibitory against many oral bacteria.  egg white lysozyme exhibited antimicrobial action against the periodontitis associated bacteria.

TI  == relationship of subgingival plaque flora to lysosomal and cytoplasmic enzyme activity in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == examining the relationships among indicators of the acute inflammatory response in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) and specific bacterial species in subgingival  plaque may provide indications of which bacterial species or groups of species may be associated with potentially destructive host-derived processes. here we report on the relationship of the subgingival plaque flora to the activity of mammalian forms of the enzymes beta-glucuronidase (beta g), lactate dehydrogenase (ldh), and arylsulfatase (as) in gcf from a total of 54 4-6 mm periodontal sites  from 13 periodontitis patients. sites were scored for probing depth (pd) and bleeding on probing, and gcf was collected using filter paper strips inserted into the sulcus for 30 s, eluted in buffer and assayed for enzyme activity. 1 week later, the patients were again evaluated for pd and bleeding, and subgingival plaque was removed with a curette oriented toward the pocket epithelium. plaque samples were examined by darkfield microscopy and cultured anaerobically on selective and non-selective media. various groups of bacteria, including species of black pigmenting bacteroides (bpb), fusobacterium sp., capnocytophaga sp, streptococcus sanguis, and total facultative organisms were enumerated. relationships among the enzymes and bacterial groups expressed as colony-forming unit (cfu) counts or as a % of the total cultivable flora were assessed by spearman correlation analysis. beta g levels were significantly correlated with populations of spirochetes, b. intermedius, b. gingivalis, and total lactose negative bpb's. correlation between beta g and f. nucleatum sp. or  capnocytophaga sp. approached but did not reach statistically significant levels. in contrast, ldh activity showed a significant positive correlation with levels of b. gingivalis and total lactose negative bpb's. as levels were significantly correlated only with b. gingivalis. beta g and ldh showed a significant negative  correlation with levels of coccoid forms. thus, beta g, an acid hydrolase which can serve as a marker for primary granule release from polymorphonuclear leukocytes, was most closely correlated with the micro-organisms found in other studies to be associated with chronic adult periodontitis.

TI  == rapidly progressive periodontitis. neutrophil chemotaxis inhibitory factors associated with the presence of bacteroides gingivalis in crevicular fluid.
AB  == in the last few years several bacteriological and immunological studies have investigated the role of bacteria and immune defects in order to establish the etiopathogenesis of periodontal disease. with regard to the immune system, a defect in polymorphonuclear neutrophil (pmn) chemotaxis has been frequently reported in patients with rapidly progressive or juvenile periodontitis. the purpose of this study was to investigate in five patients with rapidly progressive periodontitis and normal chemotaxis of peripheral blood pmns the presence of chemotaxis inhibitory activity in gingival fluid and to relate such activity to three types of bacteria, often involved in rapidly evolving periodontal lesions, that are able to inhibit in vitro pmn chemotaxis: bacteroides gingivalis, capnocytophaga sp., and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. we found strong inhibitory activity in three of these patients. this activity was consistently associated with the finding of b. gingivalis in gingival pockets. we cannot rule out, however, that other substances not of bacterial origin could be responsible for such inhibitory activity. the strict association with b. gingivalis, known to secrete blocking factors, is highly suggestive, although this data must be considered preliminary.

TI  == immunoglobulin g response to subgingival gram-negative bacteria in human subjects.
AB  == serum and gingival crevicular fluid from normal healthy adults and patients with  periodontitis were screened for immunoglobulin g antibodies to antigens from bacteroides gingivalis 381, bacteroides intermedius 24, bacteroides loescheii atcc 15930, fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25586, eikenella corrodens 1073, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans atcc 29522, and capnocytophaga sp. strain m-12. immunoglobulin g antibody titers to the antigens were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the antibody levels to b. gingivalis in serum  and gingival crevicular fluid were significantly higher in the samples from patients with periodontitis than in samples from healthy individuals. although there were individual differences within patient groups, a positive correlation (p less than 0.01) was found between the serum immunoglobulin g levels to b. gingivalis and the development of periodontitis. the antibodies to f. nucleatum (p less than 0.05), e. corrodens (p less than 0.05), and a. actinomycetemcomitans were slightly higher in patients with periodontitis than in normal subjects. there were no remarkable differences between the two groups in titers to b. intermedius, b. loescheii, and capnocytophaga sp.

TI  == relationship between oxygen tension and subgingival bacterial flora in untreated  human periodontal pockets.
AB  == the predominance of anaerobic bacteria in subgingival plaque samples suggests that the pocket environment is anaerobic. in the present investigation, a small oxygen tension (po2) electrode was inserted into the base of the pocket and the po2 was recorded. in addition, the plaque in these pockets was examined culturally and microscopically. the oxygen tension at the bottom of 36 pockets (5 to 10 mm in depth) ranged from 5 to 27 mmhg (1 mmhg congruent to 133.3 pa) with a mean value of 13.3 mmhg. moderate pockets (5 and 6 mm) exhibited a mean po2 of 15.7 mmhg, which was significantly higher than the 12.0 mmhg found in the deeper  pockets. the deep pockets had higher percentages of spirochetes and bacteroides intermedius, whereas the moderate pockets had elevated proportions of actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus mutans. the sites with oxygen tensions equal to or less than 15 mmhg had significantly higher percentages of spirochetes, whereas the microaerophilic capnocytophaga species were found in pockets with a po2 greater than 15 mmhg. the presence of bleeding in the pocket was associated with  higher proportions of b. intermedius, capnocytophaga sp., and a. naeslundii. these po2 readings of periodontal pockets indicated that there is a spectrum of po2 values which seem to define, in a general way, the microbiological composition of the pocket.
