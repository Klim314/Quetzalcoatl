TI  == new integration vector using a cellulase gene as a screening marker for lactobacillus.
AB  == the new integration vector for lactobacillus, pjc4, was developed using the extracellular endoglucanase a gene (cela) of clostridium thermocellum as a screening marker. pjc4 was transformed into four lactobacillus species, lb. johnsonii, lb. gasseri, lb. bulgaricus, and lb. plantarum. in each species, the pjc4 integrants were easily and accurately detected by the appearance of a clear  halo on a cellulase screening plate without any false transformants. polymerase chain reaction and southern hybridization indicated that all transformants with clear halos contained pjc4 in their chromosomal dnas. the cela gene could be a useful screening marker for other lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == expression of clostridium thermocellum endoglucanase gene in lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus johnsonii and characterization of the genetically modified probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == endoglucanase a from clostridium thermocellum resistant to pancreatic proteinase  was selected out of a range of microbial cellulases expressed in lactobacilli. two lactobacillus-e. coli expression vectors, harboring the endoglucanase gene from c. thermocellum under the control of its own promoter (psd1) and the lactococcus lactis lac a promoter (psd2), were constructed separately. intestinal lactobacillus strains, l. gasseri and l. johnsonii, were electrotransformed with  psd1 and psd2, and the stability of each plasmid was evaluated. the endoglucanase activities of 0.722 and 0.759 u/ml were respectively found in culture medium of l. gasseri and l. johnsonii containing psd1, and of 0.407 u/ml in medium of l. gasseri harboring psd2. when the probiotic characteristics such as acid-tolerance, bile-salt tolerance, and antibiotic susceptibility were investigated, l. gasseri and l. johnsonii were resistant to low phs of 2 and 3. also, l. johnsonii was bile-salt resistant in the presence of 0.5% oxgall and porcine bile extract. l. johnsonii and l. gasseri showed a rather homogeneous resistant pattern against tested antibiotics. both strains were resistant to amikacin, bacitracin, gentamicin, streptomycin, kanamycin, and colistin.
