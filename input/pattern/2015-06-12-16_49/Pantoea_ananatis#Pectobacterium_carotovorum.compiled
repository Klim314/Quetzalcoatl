TI  - OEM--a new medium for rapid isolation of onion-pathogenic and onion-associated bacteria.
AB  - Onions (Allium cepa L.) are plagued by a number of bacterial pathogens including  Pantoea ananatis, P. agglomerans, Burkholderia cepacia, Enterobacter cloacae, Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum, Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. axonopodis and several Pseudomonas spp. We developed a semi-selective medium, termed onion extract medium (OEM), to selectively and rapidly isolate bacteria pathogenic to and associated with onions and onion-related samples including bulbs, seeds, sets, transplant seedlings, soil and water. Most strains of interest grow sufficiently on OEM in 24h at 28 degrees C for tentative identification based on colony morphology, facilitating further characterization by microbiological and/or molecular means.
