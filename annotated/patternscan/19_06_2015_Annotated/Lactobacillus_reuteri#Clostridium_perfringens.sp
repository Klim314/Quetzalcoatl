TI  == a sequential statistical approach towards an optimized production of a broad spectrum bacteriocin substance from a soil bacterium bacillus sp. yas 1 strain.
AB  == bacteriocins, ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides, display potential applications in agriculture, medicine, and industry. the present study highlights integral statistical optimization and partial characterization of a bacteriocin substance from a soil bacterium taxonomically affiliated as bacillus sp. yas 1 after biochemical and molecular identifications. a sequential statistical approach (plackett-burman and box-behnken) was employed to optimize bacteriocin (bac yas 1) production. using optimal levels of three key determinants (yeast extract (0.48% (w/v), incubation time (62 hrs), and agitation speed (207 rpm)) in peptone yeast beef based production medium resulted in 1.6-fold enhancement in bac yas 1 level (470 au/ml arbitrary units against erwinia amylovora). bac yas 1  showed activity over a wide range of ph (1-13) and temperature (45-80 degrees c). a wide spectrum antimicrobial activity of bac yas 1 against the human pathogens (clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus epidermidis, campylobacter jejuni, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus sp., proteus sp., klebsiella sp., and salmonella typhimurium), the plant pathogen (e. amylovora), and the food spoiler  (listeria innocua) was demonstrated. on top and above, bac yas 1 showed no antimicrobial activity towards lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus bulgaricus, l. casei, l. lactis, and l. reuteri). promising characteristics of bac yas 1 prompt  its commercialization for efficient utilization in several industries.

TI  == probiotic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and taiwanese pickled cabbage.
AB  == this study assessed potential probiotic lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and from taiwanese pickled cabbage for their possible use in probiotic fermented foods by evaluating their (i) in vitro adhesive ability, resistance to biotic stress, resistance to pathogenic bacteria, and production of beta-galactosidase; (ii) milk technological properties; and (iii) in vivo adhesive ability, intestinal survival and microbial changes during and after treatment. five lactobacillus isolates identified as lactobacillus reuteri  f03, lactobacillus paracasei f08, lactobacillus rhamnosus f14, lactobacillus plantarum c06, and lactobacillus acidophilus c11 that showed resistance to gastric juice and bile salts were selected for further evaluation of their probiotic properties. all the strains demonstrated the ability to adhere to caco-2 cells, particularly, strain l. plantarum c06 and l. reuteri f03 showed satisfactory abilities, which were similar to that of the reference strain l. rhamnosus gg. the strains l. paracasei f08 and l. acidophilus c11 had the highest beta-galactosidase activity. most of the strains were resistant to aminoglycosides and vancomycin but sensitive to ampicillin, erythromycin, and penicillin. all the 5 strains elicited antibacterial activity against both gram-positive (bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus) and -negative (escherichia coli and salmonella enterica) pathogens. moreover, the strains l. reuteri f03, l. paracasei f08, and l. plantarum c06 could grow rapidly in milk without nutrient supplementation and reached 10(8) cfu/ml after 24 h of fermentation at 37 degrees c. the viable cell counts of the 3 strains remained above 10(7) cfu/ml after 21 d of storage at 4 degrees c. in the animal feeding trial, the number of intestinal lactobacilli increased significantly after administration of milk fermented with the 3 strains, and the counts of fecal coliforms and clostridium perfringens were markedly reduced. lactobacillus strains could also survive in the ileal intestinal tissue of the treated rats. technologically interesting lactobacillus isolates may be used in the future as probiotic starter cultures for manufacturing novel fermented foods.

TI  == in vitro antagonistic activities of animal intestinal strains against swine-associated pathogens.
AB  == a wide range of enteropathogens cause costly diarrhoeal diseases in fattening piglets and account for food-related infections in humans. the objective of this  study was to screen beneficial bacterial strains from the gastrointestinal tract  of various animal sources for antagonistic activity against diverse pathogens associated with hazardous pig production times. using agar spot assays, 15 well-characterized strains belonging to lactobacillus, enterococcus, bifidobacterium and bacillus were studied for inhibition of clostridium perfringens type a, various serovars of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and salmonella enterica, as well as brachyspira pilosicoli. strong antagonists were further analyzed by studying their cell-free supernatants with and without ph neutralization, proteinase k and catalase treatment. enterobacteriaceae were effectively inhibited by lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus reuteri strains, independent from the animal source, and on a lower level by single strains belonging to lactobacillus mucosae, lactobacillus amylovorus and bifidobacterium thermophilum, due to organic acid production. the bacillus subtilis strain was found to produce an anti-clostridial and anti-brachyspira metabolite of proteinaceous nature. homofermentative lactobacilli and b. thermophilum could suppress the growth of b. pilosicoli, the causative agent of intestinal spirochaetosis, whereas heterofermentative strains belonging to l. reuteri and l. mucosae had no effect. the lactic acid bacteria exerted their activity primarily by organic acid release, except one enterococcus faecium and l. amylovorus strain, which exhibited antagonism through joint activity of lactate and hydrogen peroxide. the findings of this study provide a basis for further in vitro studies and encourage feeding studies to evaluate the antagonistic potential of promising strains in pig production.

TI  == lactobacillus isolates from weaned piglets' mucosa with inhibitory activity against common porcine pathogens.
AB  == twelve lactobacilli isolates from mucosa of 3-5-week-old weaned pigs were found to exert good antimicrobial activity against common porcine pathogens (s. aureus, b. cereus, e. coli, c. perfringens). two of them produced in addition to lactic acid also considerable amounts of acetic acid, and 6 of them produced hydrogen peroxide and metabolites other than organic acids. isolates 4/26 and 2/25 (identified as l. crispatus or l. amylovorus) were inhibitory against most strains of s. aureus, b. cereus and e. coli, and especially the strain 4/26 survived well in simulated gastric and intestinal juice. diarrhea-causing e. coli o8k88h9 ent(+) was successfully inhibited by the growing culture as well as by the catalase-treated and neutralized supernatant of l. reuteri 12/26. mucin degradation and multiple resistance to antibiotics were not observed.

TI  == probiotic properties of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains isolated from porcine gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == one strain of lactobacillus salivarius, two strains of lactobacillus reuteri and  lactobacillus amylovorus, and two strains of bifidobacterium thermacidophilum with antagonistic effect against clostridium perfringens were isolated from porcine gastrointestinal tract. isolates were assayed for their ability to survive in synthetic gastric juice at ph 2.5 and were examined for their ability  to grow on agar plate containing porcine bile extract. there was a large variation in the survival of the isolates in gastric juice and growth in the medium containing 0.3% (w/v) bile. l. salivarius g11 and l. amylovorus s6 adhered to the ht-29 epithelial cell line. cell-free supernatant of l. amylovorus s6 showed higher antagonistic activity as effective as the antibiotics such as neomycin, chlortetracycline, and oxytetracycline against bacterial pathogens including c. perfringens, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, vibrio cholerae, edwardsiella tarda, and aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida.

TI  == effects of a campylobacter jejuni infection on the development of the intestinal  microflora of broiler chickens.
AB  == the effect of a campylobacter jejuni colonization on the development of the microflora of the cecum and the ileum of broiler chickens was studied using molecular methods. the infection did affect the development and complexity of the microbial communities of the ceca, but we found no permanent effect of a c. jejuni infection on the ileal microflora of the broilers. in addition, denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) profiles generated from cecal and ileal contents revealed several dgge bands that were present in the control chickens, but not in the chickens colonized with c. jejuni. some of these dgge bands could  be affiliated with lactobacillus reuteri, clostridium perfringens, and the genus  klebsiella.

TI  == characterisation and selection of probiotic lactobacilli for a preliminary minipig feeding trial and their effect on serum cholesterol levels, faeces ph and faeces moisture content.
AB  == three out of 297 lactobacillus strains isolated from pig faeces were selected for a feeding trial on account of their high bile-salt hydrolase (bsh) activity, bile-salt resistance, low ph tolerance and the production of antimicrobial substances. two strains were identified as lactobacillus johnsonii and one as lactobacillus reuteri by dna-dna hybridisation. l. johnsoniii bfe 1061 produced a bacteriocin active against a range of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and nonrelated bacteria including clostridium perfringens. six minipigs were maintained on a high-fat, high-cholesterol ('western style') diet for 17 weeks after which the diet was supplemented with the 'probiotic mixture' containing the above mentioned three lactobacillus strains at 2 x 10(12) cfu per pig per day for five weeks. the mixture was given as a resuspended lyophilisate. during a two week follow-up period the minipigs received only the 'western-style' diet without probiotic supplementation. a lowering effect on serum cholesterol levels was indicated after three weeks probiotic feeding, concomitant with an increase in the moisture content of the faeces and lactobacillus cell numbers. triglycerides, ph and number of lactic acid bacteria in faeces were not significantly influenced by probiotic supplementation.
