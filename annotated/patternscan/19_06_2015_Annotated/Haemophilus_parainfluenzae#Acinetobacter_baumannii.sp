TI  == spectrum and antimicrobial resistance of common pathogenic bacteria isolated from patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in mainland of china.
AB  == background: bacteria-induced respiratory infection has been long considered to be the major cause of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (aecopd). therefore, a clear picture about the distribution and drug-resistance of pathogenic bacteria in the lower airways should be helpful for treatment of the disease. so far, data on this topic among chinese are lacking. methods: a surveillance study was performed in consecutive patients with aecopd at five areas in china between october 2006 and april 2008. the sputum from these patients was cultured and isolated for bacteria. agar dilution method was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of levofoxacin and other 15 antibiotics against these strains. results: three hundred and fifty-nine pathogenic bacterial strains were isolated among 884 patients with aecopd. the predominant bacteria were pseudomonas aeruginosa (21.7%), klebsiella pneumoniae (12.3%), haemophilus influenzae (14.2%) and streptococcus pneumoniae (11.7%), followed by haemophilus parainfluenzae (9.5%), acinetobacter baumannii (7.8%), moraxella catarrhalis (6.4%) and escherichia coli (3.6%). the majority of bacterial pathogens isolated in this study were susceptible to fuoroquinolones, ceftazidime, cefepime and imipenem. conclusions: gram-negative bacilli are the leading pathogens in patients with aecopd in china. haemophilus parainfluenzae may be one of the most important pathogens in aecopd. this study provides evidence for local surveillance of aecopd pathogens and appropriate choice of antimicrobials in china.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a north american surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == in-vitro antibacterial activity of levofloxacin against hospital isolates: a multicentre study.
AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the activity of the fluoroquinolone,  levofloxacin, against hospital isolates of bacteria. mics of levofloxacin were determined for 2154 strains by agar dilution. breakpoints for susceptibility testing were calculated using the agar diffusion technique with 5 micrograms discs. the activity of levofloxacin against nalidixic acid- and pefloxacin-susceptible enterobacteriaceae (n = 668) was higher (mic50/90 0.06-0.12 mg/l) than previously reported for ofloxacin. as seen with other fluoroquinolones, this activity was reduced against nalidixic acid-resistant and  pefloxacin-intermediate and -resistant strains (mic 1-8 mg/l). mics for pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 104) were between 0.12 and 128 mg/l. levofloxacin had good activity against nalidixic acid- and pefloxacin-susceptible acinetobacter baumannii (n = 12; mic 0.06-0.25 mg/l), but the activity was reduced against nalidixic acid- and pefloxacin-resistant strains (n = 80; mic 1-32 mg/l). haemophilus influenzae (n = 70), haemophilus parainfluenzae (n = 47) and moraxella catarrhalis (n = 64) were inhibited by low concentrations of levofloxacin (mics 0.016-0.03 mg/l, 0.03-0.12 mg/l) and 0.03-0.12 mg/l, respectively). clostridium perfringens (n = 23; mic 0.25-1 mg/l) was more susceptible than bacteroides fragilis (n = 60; mic 0.5-4 mg/l). levofloxacin showed superior activity compared with ofloxacin against methicillin-susceptible  staphylococci (n = 107; mic 0.03-0.5 mg/l); the resistant strains (mics 2-32 mg/l) were usually also resistant to methicillin. levofloxacin was less effective against enterococci (n = 105; mic 1-32 mg/l), but streptococci (n = 192) and pneumococci (n = 129), including 58 penicillin-non-susceptible strains, were inhibited by low concentrations (mics 0.5-2 mg/l). according to the regression curve, zone diameters were usually 20-22 mm, 17-19 mm and 15-16 mm for mics of 1, 2 and 4 mg/l, respectively. in conclusion, this study, performed on a large number of strains, confirms the superior anti-bacterial activity of levofloxacin  compared with ofloxacin, especially against pathogens isolated from respiratory tract infections.
