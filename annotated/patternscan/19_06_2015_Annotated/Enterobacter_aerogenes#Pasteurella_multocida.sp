TI  == in vitro susceptibility of bacteria to a ticarcillin-clavulanic acid combination.
AB  == in vitro testing of bacterial susceptibility to a combination of ticarcillin and  clavulanic acid was done, using 406 aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative isolates (considered to be pathogens) cultured from equine and small animal specimens. a microdilution broth technique of susceptibility testing was performed, using trays with wells containing a range of doubling concentrations of dehydrated ticarcillin (range, 0.50 to 128 micrograms/ml) with fixed concentration of clavulanic acid (4 micrograms/ml). the following isolates of equine origin were (90%) susceptible to concentrations of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid combinations of less than or equal to 16 and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively: staphylococcus aureus, s intermedius, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, ent agglomerans, ent cloacae, escherichia coli, actinobacillus sp, corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, rhodococcus equi, proteus  vulgaris, and bordetella bronchiseptica. isolates of small animal origin (90%) susceptible to less than or equal to 16 and 4 micrograms of ticarcillinclavulanic/ml included s aureus, s intermedius, ent aerogenes, ent agglomerans, pasteurella multocida, b bronchiseptica, pr mirabilis, and serratia  sp.

TI  == in vitro activity of aztreonam against gram negative bacteria from clinical specimens and its comparison with other commonly used antibiotics.
AB  == a total of 755 gram negative bacteria isolated from clinical specimens were tested against aztreonam by the disc agar diffusion test. the strains of bacteria used in this study consisted of escherichia coli (314), enterobacter aerogenes (30), e. agglomerans (7), e. cloacae, (39), citrobacter diversus (9), c. freundii (13), hafnia alvei (3), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (10), klebsiella oxytoca (6), k. ozaenae (5), k. pneumoniae (107), morganella morganii (3), moraxella sp. (10), pasteurella multocida (1), proteus mirabilis (66), p. vulgaris (4), providencia rettgeri (12), p. stuartii (5), pseudomonas aeruginosa (85), p. fluorescens (2),  p. maltophila (7), salmonella sp. (1) and serratia marcescens (17). in vitro activity against aztreonam was compared with amikacin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalosporin, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, piperacillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and tobramycin. over 99% of e. coli and enterobacter species were susceptible to aztreonam. all the 118 strains of klebsiella, 87 strains of proteus-providencia and 17 strains of s. marcescens were also susceptible. aztreonam also showed good activity against p.  aeruginosa, inhibiting 90% of the 85 isolates tested.

TI  == laboratory diagnosis of bacteremia by headspace gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  == the growth of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. fecalis, s. sanguis, s. bovis, s. mitior, s. agalactiae, escherichia coli, a-d group, klebsiella aerogenes, k. oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, pasteurella multocida or listeria monocytogenes in 83 blood  cultures was detected in a 1.5-min analysis using head-space gas-liquid chromatography. two hundred and twenty-four blood cultures in which there was no  growth of micro-organisms were negative in the analysis. the analysis detected the growth of s. epidermidis in only 6 of 26 blood cultures and failed to detect  the growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans and species of micrococcus, corynebacterium or bacillus in 18 blood cultures.

TI  == acute severe mastitis in cows of the dutch-friesian breed (author's transl).
AB  == one hundred cases of severe acute mastitis are reported. bacteriological examination of the milk was negative in 23% of the cases. e. coli was most frequently found to be the causative organism (23%), followed by st. aureus (19%), c. pyogenes (10%), str. dysgalactiae (9%), str. agalactiae (5%) and a number of other pathogenic agents such as atypical streptococci, str. uberis, haemolytic streptococci, aerobacter aerogenes, kl. pneumoniae, a clostridium and  p. multocida. in several cases, a tentative diagnosis may be based on the clinical symptoms, which is then found to be correct on bacteriological examination of the milk. the prognosis will vary with the causative organism. treatment was life-saving in more than 90% of the cases, the milk-producing capacity of the affected quarter being completely preserved in 36% and partly preserved in 27% of the cases.
