TI  == prevotella maculosa sp. nov., isolated from the human oral cavity.
AB  == three strains of anaerobic gram-negative bacilli isolated from human oral sites were subjected to a comprehensive range of phenotypic and genotypic tests and were found to comprise a homogeneous group. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis revealed the strains to constitute a novel group within the genus prevotella, most closely related to prevotella oris and prevotella salivae. a novel species,  prevotella maculosa sp. nov., is proposed to accommodate these strains. prevotella maculosa is saccharolytic and produces acetic and succinic acids as end products of fermentation. the g+c content of the dna of the type strain is 48 mol%. the type strain of prevotella maculosa is w1609(t) (=dsm 19339(t) =ccug 54766(t)).

TI  == prevotella timonensis sp. nov., isolated from a human breast abscess.
AB  == gram-negative anaerobic rods were isolated from a human breast abscess. based on  genotypic and phenotypic characteristics, the novel strain belonged to the genus  prevotella. phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rrna gene sequence comparisons showed that it was closely related to prevotella buccalis (94 % 16s rrna gene sequence similarity), prevotella salivae (90 %) and prevotella oris (89.1 %). the major cellular fatty acid was c(14 : 0) (19.5 %). the new isolate represents a novel species in the genus prevotella, for which the name prevotella timonensis sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain is strain 4401737(t) (=cip 108522(t)=ccug 50105(t)).

TI  == prevotella shahii sp. nov. and prevotella salivae sp. nov., isolated from the human oral cavity.
AB  == two bacterial strains, ehs11(t) and epsa11(t), which were isolated from the human oral cavity, were characterized in terms of phenotypic and biochemical characteristics, cellular fatty acid profiles and phylogenetic position based on  16s rrna gene sequence analysis. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis showed that each of the isolates belonged to a novel species of the genus prevotella. strain ehs11(t) was related to prevotella loescheii (about 95 % similarity), whereas strain epsa11(t) was related to prevotella oris (about 94 % similarity). both strains were obligately anaerobic, non-pigmented, non-spore-forming, non-motile,  gram-negative rods. the cellular fatty acid composition of strain epsa11(t) was very similar to that of p. oris jcm 8540(t). on the other hand, the cellular fatty acid composition of strain ehs11(t) was significantly different from those  of other prevotella species. the predominant fatty acids in strain ehs11(t) are c(18 : 1)omega9c, c(16 : 0) and c(16 : 0) 3-oh, whereas other prevotella species, except for p. loescheii jcm 8530(t), possess anteiso-c(15 : 0), iso-c(17 : 0) 3-oh and c(18 : 1)omega9c. the predominant fatty acids in p. loescheii jcm 8530(t) are anteiso-c(15 : 0), c(16 : 0) and c(18 : 1)omega9c. dna-dna hybridization experiments revealed a genomic distinction of strains ehs11(t) and  epsa11(t) from p. loescheii jcm 8530(t) and p. oris jcm 8540(t). on the basis of  these data, two novel prevotella species are proposed: prevotella shahii sp. nov. and prevotella salivae sp. nov. the type strains of p. shahii and p. salivae are  ehs11(t) (=jcm 12083(t)=dsm 15611(t)) and epsa11(t) (=jcm 12084(t)=dsm 15606(t)), respectively.
