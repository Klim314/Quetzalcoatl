TI  - Bacterial counts from five over-the-counter probiotics: are you getting what you  paid for?
AB  - There is concern that the bacterial colony counts present at the time of manufacture and listed on the probiotic package may not be reflective of the numbers viable colonies at the time of purchase and patient consumption thereby diminishing efficacy. We performed a colony count study of three separate samples of five different probiotics purchased from three different stores: Bifidobacterium infantis (Align((R))); Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285((R)) and Lactobacillus casei LBC80R((R)) (Bio-K+((R))); Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (Culturelle((R))); Saccharomyces boulardii (Florastor((R))) and "L. acidophilus" and "Lactobacillus helveticus" (Lactinex((R))). Approximately 1 g of powder of each (Lactinex((R)) tablets were crushed before testing) was reconstituted in sterile distilled water, serial 10-fold dilutions were prepared and plated in duplicate onto blood agar plates, with incubation for 48 h in an anaerobic chamber (except the Saccharomyces which was incubated aerobically) after which colony counts were performed. The Florastor((R)) packaging did not state an expected concentration and was found to have 9.2 x 10(9)-1.3 x 10(10) CFU/g. Lactinex((R)), Align((R)), Bio-K+((R)), and Culturelle((R)) had viable colony counts that were similar to those stated on the package.
TI  - A probiotics-containing biscuit modulates the intestinal microbiota in the elderly.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Evaluation of the impact of a biscuit containing the probiotics Bifidobacterium longum Bar33 and Lactobacillus helveticus Bar13 on the intestinal microbiota in the elderly. DESIGN: Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-two elderly volunteers living in Italy. The group was composed of 19 women and 13 men aged between 71 and 88 years (mean 76). INTERVENTION: Subjects were randomized in two groups consuming one dose of the probiotics-containing biscuit or placebo once a day for 30 days. MEASUREMENTS: For each subject the intestinal microbiota was characterized using the phylogenetic microarray platform HTF-Microbi.Array before and after intervention. RESULTS: Our data demonstrated that one-month consumption of a probiotics-containing biscuit was effective in redressing some of the age-related dysbioses of the intestinal microbiota. In particular, the probiotic treatment reverted the age-related increase of the opportunistic pathogens Clostridium cluster XI, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecium and the enteropathogenic genus Campylobacter. CONCLUSION: The present study opens the way to the development of elderly-tailored probiotic-based functional foods to counteract the age-related dysbioses of the intestinal microbiota.
