TI  == effect of stoned olive pomace on rumen microbial communities and polyunsaturated  fatty acid biohydrogenation: an in vitro study.
AB  == background: stoned olive pomace (sop), which represents approximately 50% of the  conversion process of olives to olive oil, is largely not utilised and creates costs for its disposal and has negative environmental impacts. in vitro trial experiments were employed to study the effect of feeds integrated with this bio-waste, which is rich in polyphenols, on rumen biohydrogenation, using sheep rumen liquor as inoculum. results: fatty acid (fa) analysis and a polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) approach aimed  at characterising the microbial community indicated that including sop in feeds at the level of 50 g/kg and 90 g/kg induced changes in the fa profile and microbial populations. the simultaneous decrease of butyrivibrio proteoclasticus  and accumulation of vaccenic acid was observed. a depression in the populations of neisseria weaveri, ruminobacter amylophilus and other unclassified bacteria related to members of the lachnospiraceae and pasteurellaceae families was detected, suggesting that these microbial groups may be involved in rumen biohydrogenation. conclusions: supplementation of feeds with sop alters the rumen bacterial community, including bacteria responsible for the hydrogenation of vaccenic acid to stearic acid, thereby modifying the fa profile of the rumen liquor. hence, a use of sop aimed to produce meat or dairy products enriched in functional lipids can be hypothesised.

TI  == diversity of butyrivibrio group bacteria in the rumen of goats and its response to the supplementation of garlic oil.
AB  == this study aimed to investigate the diversity of the butyrivibrio group bacteria  in goat rumen and its response to garlic oil (go) supplementation as revealed by  molecular analysis of cloned 16s rrna genes. six wethers fitted with ruminal fistulas were assigned to two groups for a cross-over design with 28-d experimental period and 14-d interval. goats were fed a basal diet without (control) or with go ruminal infusion (0.8 g/d). ruminal contents were used for dna extraction collected before morning feeding on d 28. a total bacterial clone  library was firstly constructed by nearly full-length 16s rrna gene cloned sequences using universal primers. the resulting plasmids selected by butyrivibrio-specific primers were used to construct a butyrivibrio group-specific bacterial clone library. butyrivibrio group represented 12.98% and 10.95% of total bacteria in control and go group, respectively. in libraries, clones were classified to the genus pseudobutyrivibrio, butyrivibrio and others within the family lachnospiraceae. additionally, some specific clones were observed in go group, being classified to the genus ruminococcus and others within the family ruminococcaceae. based on the criterion that the similarity was 97% or greater with database sequences, there were 29.73% and 18.42% of clones identified as known isolates (i.e. b. proteoclasticus and ps. ruminis) in control and go groups, respectively. further clones identified as b. fibrisolvens (5.41%) and r. flavefaciens (7.89%) were specifically found in control and go groups, respectively. the majority of clones resembled ps. ruminis (98% to 99% similarity), except for lachnospiraceae bacteria (87% to 92% similarity) in the two libraries. the two clone libraries also appeared different in shannon diversity index (control 2.47 and go group 2.91). our results indicated that the  butyrivibrio group bacteria had a complex community with considerable unknown species in the goat rumen.

TI  == as yet uncultured bacteria phylogenetically classified as prevotella, lachnospiraceae incertae sedis and unclassified bacteroidales, clostridiales and  ruminococcaceae may play a predominant role in ruminal biohydrogenation.
AB  == microbial biohydrogenation of dietary poly-unsaturated fatty acids (pufa) to saturated fatty acids (sfa) in the rumen results in the high ratio of sfa/pufa in ruminant products, such as meat and milk. in vitro, butyrivibrio proteoclasticus-related bacteria extensively biohydrogenate pufa to sfa, yet their contribution in the rumen has not been confirmed. the aim of this study was to evaluate the role of butyrivibrio proteoclasticus group bacteria in ruminal biohydrogenation and to assess the possible role of other bacteria. fish oil at 0%, 1.5% and 3% dry matter intake was fed to eight holstein x friesian steers, in order to elicit changes in the extent of pufa biohydrogenation. fatty acid and b. proteoclasticus group 16s rrna concentrations in rumen digesta were determined. correlation between digesta 18:0 concentration and b. proteoclasticus group 16s rrna concentration was low. terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) coupled with multivariate statistics revealed that many terminal restriction fragments (t-rfs) and dgge bands were linked to cis-9, trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (cla), 18:1 trans-11 and 18:0 ruminal concentrations. mica t-rf predictive identification software showed that these linked t-rfs were likely to originate from as yet uncultured bacteria classified as prevotella, lachnospiraceae incertae sedis, and unclassified bacteroidales, clostridiales and ruminococcaceae. sequencing of linked dgge bands also revealed that as yet uncultured bacteria classified as prevotella, anaerovoax (member of the lachnospiraceae incertae sedis family), and unclassified clostridiales and ruminococcaceae may play a role in biohydrogenation.
