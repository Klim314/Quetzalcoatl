TI  == in vitro activities of mk-826 (l-749,345) against 363 strains of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of mk-826 was compared to the activities of cefoxitin, ceftriaxone,  imipenem, and meropenem against 363 gram-negative and gram-positive anaerobes by  using nccls procedures. at least 98% of the strains were susceptible to the carbapenems. all strains of clostridium perfringens, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus, and sutterella wadsworthensis were susceptible to all agents  tested.
