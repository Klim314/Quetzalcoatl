TI  == nickel, manganese and copper removal by a mixed consortium of sulfate reducing bacteria at a high cod/sulfate ratio.
AB  == the use of sulfate-reducing bacteria (srb) in passive treatments of acidic effluents containing heavy metals has become an attractive alternative biotechnology. treatment efficiency may be linked with the effluent conditions (ph and metal concentration) and also to the amount and nature of the organic substrate. variations on organic substrate and sulfate ratios clearly interfere with the biological removal of this ion by mixed cultures of srb. this study aimed to cultivate a mixed culture of srb using different lactate concentrations  at ph 7.0 in the presence of ni, mn and cu. the highest sulfate removal efficiency obtained was 98 %, at a cod/sulfate ratio of 2.0. the organic acid analyses indicated an acetate accumulation as a consequence of lactate degradation. different concentrations of metals were added to the system at neutral ph conditions. cell proliferation and sulfate consumption in the presence of nickel (4, 20 and 50 mg l(-1)), manganese (1.5, 10 and 25 mg l(-1)) and copper (1.5, 10 and 25 mg l(-1)) were measured. the presence of metals interfered in the sulfate biological removal however the concentration of sulfide produced was high enough to remove over 90 % of the metals in the environment. the molecular characterization of the bacterial consortium based on dsrb gene sequencing indicated the presence of desulfovibrio desulfuricans, desulfomonas pigra and desulfobulbus sp. the results here presented indicate that this srb culture may be employed for mine effluent bioremediation due to its potential for removing sulfate and metals, simultaneously.

TI  == transformation, localization, and biomolecular binding of hg species at subcellular level in methylating and nonmethylating sulfate-reducing bacteria.
AB  == microbial activity is recognized to play an important role on hg methylation in aquatic ecosystems. however, the mechanism at the cellular level is still poorly  understood. in this work subcellular partitioning and transformation of hg species in two strains: desulfovibrio sp. beroc1 and desulfovibrio desulfuricans  g200 (which exhibit different hg methylation potential) are studied as an approach to the elucidation of hg methylation/demethylation processes. the incubation with isotopically labeled hg species ((199)hgi and me(201)hg) not only allows the determination of methylation and demethylation rates simultaneously, but also the comparison of the localization of the originally added and resulting species of such metabolic processes. a dissimilar hg species distribution was observed. in general terms, monomethylmercury (mehg) is preferentially localized  in the extracellular fraction; meanwhile inorganic mercury (hgi) is associated to the cells. the investigation of hg binding biomolecules on the cytoplasmatic and  extracellular fractions (size exclusion chromatography coupled to icp-ms) revealed noticeable differences in the pattern corresponding to the hg methylating and nonmethylating strains.

TI  == desulfovibrio desulfuricans pglb homolog possesses oligosaccharyltransferase activity with relaxed glycan specificity and distinct protein acceptor sequence requirements.
AB  == oligosaccharyltransferases (otases) are responsible for the transfer of carbohydrates from lipid carriers to acceptor proteins and are present in all domains of life. in bacteria, the most studied member of this family is pglb from campylobacter jejuni (pglb(cj)). this enzyme is functional in escherichia coli and, contrary to its eukaryotic counterparts, has the ability to transfer a variety of oligo- and polysaccharides to protein carriers in vivo. phylogenetic analysis revealed that in the delta proteobacteria desulfovibrio sp., the pglb homolog is more closely related to eukaryotic and archaeal otases than to its campylobacter counterparts. genetic analysis revealed the presence of a putative  operon that might encode all enzymes required for n-glycosylation in desulfovibrio desulfuricans. d. desulfuricans pglb (pglb(dd)) was cloned and successfully expressed in e. coli, and its activity was confirmed by transferring the c. jejuni heptasaccharide onto the model protein acceptor acra. in contrast to pglb(cj), which adds two glycan chains to acra, a single oligosaccharide was attached to the protein by pglb(dd). site-directed mutagenesis of the five putative n-x-s/t glycosylation sites in acra and mass spectrometry analysis showed that pglb(dd) does not recognize the "conventional bacterial glycosylation sequon" consisting of the sequence d/e-x(1)-n-x(2)-s/t (where x(1) and x(2) are any amino acid except proline), and instead used a different site for the attachment of the oligosaccharide than pglb(cj.). furthermore, pglb(dd) exhibited relaxed glycan specificity, being able to transfer mono- and polysaccharides to acra. our analysis constitutes the first characterization of an otase from delta-proteobacteria involved in n-linked protein glycosylation.

TI  == the influence of ionic strength, nutrients and ph on bacterial adhesion to metals.
AB  == bacteria-metal interactions in aqueous solutions are important in biofilm formation, biofouling and biocorrosion problems in the natural environment and engineered systems. in this study, the adhesion forces of two anaerobes (desulfovibrio desulfuricans and desulfovibrio singaporenus) and an aerobe (pseudomonas sp.) to stainless steel 316 in various aqueous systems were quantified using atomic force microscopy (afm) with a cell probe. results show that the nutrient and ionic strength of the solutions influence the bacteria-metal interactions. the bacteria-metal adhesion force was reduced in the presence of the nutrients in the solution, because a trace organic film was formed and thus decreased the metal surface wettability. stronger ionic strength  in the solution results in a larger bacteria-metal adhesion force, which is due to the stronger electrostatic attraction force between the positively charged metal surface and negatively charged bacterial surface. solution ph also influences the interaction between the bacterial cells and the metal surface; the bacteria-metal adhesion force reached its highest value when the ph of the solution was near the isoelectric point of the bacteria, i.e. at the zero point charge. the adhesion forces at ph 9 were higher than at ph 7 due to the increase  in the attraction between fe ions and negative carboxylate groups.

TI  == experimental evaluation and mathematical modeling of microbially enhanced tetrachloroethene (pce) dissolution.
AB  == experiments to assess metabolic reductive dechlorination (chlororespiration) at high concentration levels consistent with the presence of free-phase tetrachloroethene (pce) were performed using three pce-to-cis-1,2-dichloroethene  (cis-dce) dechlorinating pure cultures (sulfurospirillum multivorans, desulfuromonas michiganensis strain bb1, and geobacter lovleyi strain sz) and desulfitobacterium sp. strain viet1, a pce-to-trichloroethene (tce) dechlorinating isolate. despite recent evidence suggesting bacterial pce-to-cis-dce dechlorination occurs at or near pce saturation (0.9-1.2 mm), all  cultures tested ceased dechlorinating at approximately 0.54 mm pce. in the presence of pce dense nonaqueous phase liquid (dnapl), strains bb1 and sz initially dechlorinated, but tce and cis-dce production ceased when aqueous pce concentrations reached inhibitory levels. for s. multivorans, dechlorination proceeded at a rate sufficient to maintain pce concentrations below inhibitory levels, resulting in continuous cis-dce production and complete dissolution of the pce dnapl. a novel mathematical model, which accounts for loss of dechlorinating activity at inhibitory pce concentrations, was developed to simultaneously describe pce-dnapl dissolution and reductive dechlorination kinetics. the model predicted that conditions corresponding to a bioavailability  number (bn) less than 1.25 x 10(-2) will lead to dissolution enhancement with the tested cultures, while conditions corresponding to a bn greater than this threshold value can result in accumulation of pce to inhibitory dissolved-phase levels, limiting pce transformation and dissolution enhancement. these results suggest that microorganisms incapable of dechlorinating at high pce concentrations can enhance the dissolution and transformation of pce from free-phase dnapl.

TI  == force measurements of bacterial adhesion on metals using a cell probe atomic force microscope.
AB  == the adhesion of microbial cells to metal surfaces in aqueous media is an important phenomenon in both the natural environment and engineering systems. the adhesion of two anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacteria (desulfovibrio desulfuricans  and a local marine isolate) and an aerobe (pseudomonas sp.) to four polished metal surfaces (i.e., stainless steel 316, mild steel, aluminum, and copper) was  examined using a force spectroscopy technique with an atomic force microscope (afm). using a modified bacterial tip, the attraction and repulsion forces (in the nano-newton range) between the bacterial cell and the metal surface in aqueous media were quantified. results show that the bacterial adhesion force to  aluminum is the highest among the metals investigated, whereas the one to copper  is the lowest. the bacterial adhesion forces to metals are influenced by both the electrostatic force and metal surface hydrophobicity. it is also found that the physiological properties of the bacterium, namely the bacterial surface charges and hydrophobicity, also have influence on the bacteria-metal interaction. the adhesion to the metals by pseudomonas sp. and d. desulfuricans was greater than by the marine srb isolate. the cell-cell interactions show that there are strong  electrostatic repulsion forces between bacterial cells. cell probe atomic force microscopy has provided some useful insight into the interactions of bacterial cells with the metal surfaces.

TI  == direct force measurement of bacteria adhesion on metal in aqueous media.
AB  == the adhesion of bacteria on metal surfaces in aqueous media and the development of biofilm and resultant biofouling are important phenomena in both the natural environment and engineering systems. this work reports on the use of a force microscopy technique to measure bacterial metal adhesion by two anaerobic sulphate-reducing bacteria (desulfovibrio desulfuricans and a local marine isolate) and an aerobe (pseudomonas sp.). using a modified bacteria tip, the atomic force microscope was able to quantify the attraction and repulsion force in the nano-newton range between the bacteria cell and metal surface in aqueous media. results show that increasing surface hydrophobicity of the metal, and increasing the ionic strength of the aqueous medium both enhance the adhesion force. the adhesion forces were also influenced by the physiological properties of the bacterium, such as the bacterial surface charges and hydrophobicity.

TI  == biotechnological potential of sulfate-reducing bacteria for transformation of nitrocellulose.
AB  == the biotransformation of nc by desulfovibrio sp. was studied. the mass of nc was  decreased by 4.9-9.3%. the rate of nc transformation was between 46 and 73 mg nc  per mg of bacterial protein in 10 days. moreover, n content (%n) in the remaining nc was reduced by 2-12%. the inhibitory effect of nc was clearly expressed when the growth of d. desulfuricans 1388 in lactate/sulfate medium was initiated. the  growth rate of bacteria was 1.5-fold greater when nc was not added (0.074 and 0.05 h(-1) respectively). the transformation of nc by d. desulfuricans was accompanied by the appearance of nitrate in the culture liquid, the amount of which reached the peak by the 8th day.

TI  == [adhesion of sulphate-reducing bacteria to steel under cathode polarization].
AB  == adhesion of different (as to their corrosion aggression) strains of sulphate-reducing bacteria to steel has been studied under cathode polarization at various potentials: -800, -900, -1000, -1200 mv. it has been established that  cathode polarization differently affects the adhesion of strain of sulphate-reducing bacteria with various aggression to steel. correlation between  the bacterial strains aggression and the number of cells adhered to metal have been noted. the cells of aggressive strains of d. indonensis indonesia and desulfovibrio sp. kiev-10 adhered to metal most actively at cathode depolarization (8.0 x 10(7) and 3.5 x 10(7) cell/cm2, respectively). nonaggressive strains of bacteria d. desulfuricans kiev-45 and desulfobulbus sp.  portsmouth adhered to metal in a less quantity. the data obtained prove that the  use of cathode protection without allowance for the microbe factor can lead to intensification of the corrosion process.

TI  == [effect of corrosion inhibitor on adhesion of sulfate-reducing bacteria to steel  and their production of exopolymer complex].
AB  == it was shown in the laboratory investigations that the cells of sulphate-reducing bacteria of both aggressive desulfovibrio sp. strain kiev-10 and nonaggressive desulfovibrio desulfuricans strain kiev-45 strains can produce exopolysaccharides (eps). plankton (freely floating) cells of sulphate-reducing bacteria produce greater quantity of eps than the cells of the biofilm formed on steel. the inducing effect of metal on eps synthesis by sulphate-reducing bacteria has been  established. the content of carbohydrates in eps is higher in the biofilm of aggressive strain desulfovibrio sp. kiev-10 than in plankton bacteria as well as  compared with the biofilm of less aggressive strain desulfovibrio desulfuricans kiev-45. specific production of eps of the aggressive strain in the biofilm formed on the steel is 3 orders higher than in the plankton cells. it has been established that the quantity of cells of sulphate-reducing bacteria adhered to steel decreases in the presence of the corrosion inhibitor n-decylpyridinium chloride (high-molecular compound of nitrogen-including par of the cationic type). it is shown that eps synthesis is blocked in the biofilm formed by sulphate-reducing bacteria on steel under the effect of the corrosion inhibitor,  while eps production in plankton is stimulated.

TI  == susceptibility of desulfovibrio desulfuricans intestinal strains to sulfasalazine and its biotransformation products.
AB  == background: desulfovibrio desulfuricans intestinal bacteria may contribute to toxic hydrogen sulfide production in the human gut. our objective was to examine  whether the d. desulfuricans strains isolated from the human body are susceptible to sulfasalazine (sas) and the products of its biotransformation, i.e. 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-asa) and sulfapyridine (sp), in order to determine the relationship between the strains' susceptibility to sas and their ability to reduce the azo bond within this drug. material/methods: six wild strains of d. desulfuricans (isolated from feces and biopsy specimens from patients with colitis ulcerosa, crohn's disease, irritable bowel syndrome, colonic diverticula, primary biliary cirrhosis, or tubular adenomas of the colon) were cultured in the presence of sas, 5-asa, and sp. growth inhibition coefficients were compared with coefficients of inhibition of the azo-bond reduction in sas. results: the d. desulfuricans strains present in the human digestive tract were susceptible to a  small degree to sas and to 5-asa and sp. conclusions: the intestinal d. desulfuricans strains differed in their susceptibility to sas and its biotransformation products. the strains showing higher susceptibility to sas lost the ability to reduce the azo bond in this drug, which may be attributed to the lower metabolic activity of the bacteria. the presence of d. desulfuricans in the large intestines of patients with ulcerative colitis and the confirmed diversity  of the biological activity of the isolated strains demonstrate the need for clinical examination of the role of these bacteria in the development of some inflammatory disorders.

TI  == sulphate-reducing bacteria, palladium and the reductive dehalogenation of chlorinated aromatic compounds.
AB  == the surfaces of cells of desulfovibrio desulfuricans, desulfovibrio vulgaris and  a new strain, desulfovibrio sp. 'oz-7' were used to manufacture a novel bioinorganic catalyst via the reduction of pd(ii) to pd(0) at the cell surface using hydrogen as the electron donor. the ability of the palladium coated (palladised) cells to reductively dehalogenate chlorophenol and polychlorinated biphenyl species was demonstrated. dried, palladised cells of d. desulfuricans, d. vulgaris and desulfovibrio sp. 'oz-7' were more effective bioinorganic catalysts than pd(ii) reduced chemically under h2 or commercially available finely divided pd(0). differences were observed in the catalytic activity of the  preparations when compared with each other. negligible chloride release occurred  from chlorophenol and polychlorinated biphenyls using biomass alone.

TI  == desulfovibrio sp. genes involved in the respiration of sulfate during metabolism  of hydrogen and lactate.
AB  == to develop a better understanding of respiration by sulfate-reducing bacteria, we examined transcriptional control of respiratory genes during growth with lactate  or hydrogen as an electron donor. rna extracts of desulfovibrio desulfuricans subsp. aestuarii were analyzed by using random arbitrarily primed pcr. rna was reverse transcribed under low-stringency conditions with a set of random primers, and candidate cdnas were cloned, sequenced, and characterized by blast analysis.  putative differentially expressed transcripts were confirmed by northern blot analysis. interestingly, dissimilatory bisulfite reductase was upregulated in the presence of hydrogen. to link these transcriptional changes to the physiology of  sulfate-reducing bacteria, sulfide was measured during growth of several strains  of desulfovibrio on hydrogen or lactate, and this revealed that hydrogen-grown cells produced more sulfide per unit of cell mass than lactate-grown cells. transcription of other redox proteins was characterized by northern blotting to determine whether or not they were also transcribed to higher levels in hydrogen-grown cells. growth on lactate produced greater transcription of [nife]  hydrogenase. h(2)-grown cells transcribed the adenylylsulfate reductase b subunit and hmca to higher levels. the results we describe here provide new insight into  the continuing debate over how desulfovibrio species utilize redox components to  generate membrane potential and to channel electrons to sulfate, the final electron acceptor.

TI  == conformational component in the coupled transfer of multiple electrons and protons in a monomeric tetraheme cytochrome.
AB  == cell metabolism relies on energy transduction usually performed by complex membrane-spanning proteins that couple different chemical processes, e.g. electron and proton transfer in proton-pumps. there is great interest in determining at the molecular level the structural details that control these energy transduction events, particularly those involving multiple electrons and protons, because tight control is required to avoid the production of dangerous reactive intermediates. tetraheme cytochrome c(3) is a small soluble and monomeric protein that performs a central step in the bioenergetic metabolism of  sulfate reducing bacteria, termed "proton-thrusting," linking the oxidation of molecular hydrogen with the reduction of sulfate. the mechano-chemical coupling involved in the transfer of multiple electrons and protons in cytochrome c(3) from desulfovibrio desulfuricans atcc 27774 is described using results derived from the microscopic thermodynamic characterization of the redox and acid-base centers involved, crystallographic studies in the oxidized and reduced states of  the cytochrome, and theoretical studies of the redox and acid-base transitions. this proton-assisted two-electron step involves very small, localized structural  changes that are sufficient to generate the complex network of functional cooperativities leading to energy transduction, while using molecular mechanisms  distinct from those established for other desulfovibrio sp. cytochromes from the  same structural family.

TI  == modeling reduction of uranium u(vi) under variable sulfate concentrations by sulfate-reducing bacteria.
AB  == the kinetics for the reduction of sulfate alone and for concurrent uranium [u(vi)] and sulfate reduction, by mixed and pure cultures of sulfate-reducing bacteria (srb) at 21 +/- 3 degrees c were studied. the mixed culture contained the srb desulfovibrio vulgaris along with a clostridium sp. determined via 16s ribosomal dna analysis. the pure culture was desulfovibrio desulfuricans (atcc 7757). a zero-order model best fit the data for the reduction of sulfate from 0.1 to 10 mm. a lag time occurred below cell concentrations of 0.1 mg (dry weight) of cells/ml. for the mixed culture, average values for the maximum specific reaction rate, v(max), ranged from 2.4 +/- 0.2 micromol of sulfate/mg (dry weight) of srb. h(-1)) at 0.25 mm sulfate to 5.0 +/- 1.1 micromol of sulfate/mg (dry weight) of srb. h(-1) at 10 mm sulfate (average cell concentration, 0.52 mg [dry weight]/ml). for the pure culture, v(max) was 1.6 +/- 0.2 micromol of sulfate/mg  (dry weight) of srb. h(-1) at 1 mm sulfate (0.29 mg [dry weight] of cells/ml). when both electron acceptors were present, sulfate reduction remained zero order  for both cultures, while uranium reduction was first order, with rate constants of 0.071 +/- 0.003 mg (dry weight) of cells/ml. min(-1) for the mixed culture and 0.137 +/- 0.016 mg (dry weight) of cells/ml. min(-1) (u(0) = 1 mm) for the d. desulfuricans culture. both cultures exhibited a faster rate of uranium reduction in the presence of sulfate and no lag time until the onset of u reduction in contrast to u alone. this kinetics information can be used to design an srb-dominated biotreatment scheme for the removal of u(vi) from an aqueous source.

TI  == sulfate-reducing bacteria methylate mercury at variable rates in pure culture and in marine sediments.
AB  == differences in methylmercury (ch(3)hg) production normalized to the sulfate reduction rate (srr) in various species of sulfate-reducing bacteria (srb) were quantified in pure cultures and in marine sediment slurries in order to determine if srb strains which differ phylogenetically methylate mercury (hg) at similar rates. cultures representing five genera of the srb (desulfovibrio desulfuricans, desulfobulbus propionicus, desulfococcus multivorans, desulfobacter sp. strain bg-8, and desulfobacterium sp. strain bg-33) were grown in a strictly anoxic, minimal medium that received a dose of inorganic hg 120 h after inoculation. the  mercury methylation rates (mmr) normalized per cell were up to 3 orders of magnitude higher in pure cultures of members of srb groups capable of acetate utilization (e.g., the family desulfobacteriaceae) than in pure cultures of members of groups that are not able to use acetate (e.g., the family desulfovibrionaceae). little or no hg methylation was observed in cultures of desulfobacterium or desulfovibrio strains in the absence of sulfate, indicating that hg methylation was coupled to respiration in these strains. mercury methylation, sulfate reduction, and the identities of sulfate-reducing bacteria in marine sediment slurries were also studied. sulfate-reducing consortia were identified by using group-specific oligonucleotide probes that targeted the 16s rrna molecule. acetate-amended slurries, which were dominated by members of the desulfobacterium and desulfobacter groups, exhibited a pronounced ability to methylate hg when the mmr were normalized to the srr, while lactate-amended and control slurries had normalized mmr that were not statistically different. collectively, the results of pure-culture and amended-sediment experiments suggest that members of the family desulfobacteriaceae have a greater potential to methylate hg than members of the family desulfovibrionaceae have when the mmr  are normalized to the srr. hg methylation potential may be related to genetic composition and/or carbon metabolism in the srb. furthermore, we found that in marine sediments that are rich in organic matter and dissolved sulfide rapid ch(3)hg accumulation is coupled to rapid sulfate reduction. the observations described above have broad implications for understanding the control of ch(3)hg  formation and for developing remediation strategies for hg-contaminated sediments.

TI  == sulfonates as terminal electron acceptors for growth of sulfite-reducing bacteria (desulfitobacterium spp.) and sulfate-reducing bacteria: effects of inhibitors of sulfidogenesis.
AB  == this study demonstrates the ability of desulfitobacterium spp. to utilize aliphatic sulfonates as terminal electron acceptors (tea) for growth. isethionate (2-hydroxyethanesulfonate) reduction by desulfitobacterium hafniense resulted in  acetate as well as sulfide accumulation in accordance with the expectation that the carbon portion of isethionate was oxidized to acetate and the sulfur was reduced to sulfide. the presence of a polypeptide, approximately 97 kda, was evident in isethionate-grown cells of desulfitobacterium hafniense, desulfitobacterium sp. strain pce 1, and the two sulfate-reducing bacteria (srb)-desulfovibrio desulfuricans ic1 (t. j. lie, j. r. leadbetter, and e. r. leadbetter, geomicrobiol. j. 15:135-149, 1998) and desulfomicrobium norvegicum; this polypeptide was not detected when these bacteria were grown on tea other than isethionate, suggesting involvement in its metabolism. the sulfate analogs molybdate and tungstate, effective in inhibiting sulfate reduction by srb, were examined for their effects on sulfonate reduction. molybdate effectively inhibited sulfonate reduction by strain ic1 and selectively inhibited isethionate (but not cysteate) reduction by desulfitobacterium dehalogenans and desulfitobacterium sp. strain pce 1. desulfitobacterium hafniense, however, grew  with both isethionate and cysteate in the presence of molybdate. in contrast, tungstate only partially inhibited sulfonate reduction by both srb and desulfitobacterium spp. similarly, another inhibitor of sulfate reduction, 1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone, effectively inhibited sulfate reduction by srb but only partially inhibited sulfonate reduction by both srb and desulfitobacterium hafniense.

AB  == a gram-negative, anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacterium was isolated from hindgut contents of the lower termite mastotermes darwiniensis froggatt (strain kms2). strain kms2 is motile by a single polar flagellum. the isolate possesses desulfoviridin and catalase activity. the g+c content of its dna is in the range  of 54.5-55.5 mol% (strain kms2). it respires hydrogen and different low molecular weight organic compounds in the presence of sulfate, thiosulfate, and sulfite, and also oxygen. the isolated strain ferments pyruvate. fastest growth with a doubling time of 12.5 h was obtained at 37 degrees c and not at 28 degrees c, the temperature at which the termites were grown. the isolate showed a 16s rdna sequence homology of 95.9% to desulfovibrio desulfuricans atcc 27774 and a dna-dna homology of 44.6% to d. desulfuricans essex 6 (type strain). based on its biochemical properties and 16s rdna sequence, the isolate was assigned to a new species named desulfovibrio intestinalis.

TI  == evidence for the bacterial origin of genes encoding fermentation enzymes of the amitochondriate protozoan parasite entamoeba histolytica.
AB  == entamoeba histolytica is an amitochondriate protozoan parasite with numerous bacterium-like fermentation enzymes including the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (por), ferredoxin (fd), and alcohol dehydrogenase e (adhe). the goal of this study was to determine whether the genes encoding these cytosolic e. histolytica fermentation enzymes might derive from a bacterium by horizontal transfer, as has previously been suggested for e. histolytica genes encoding heat shock protein 60, nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase, and superoxide dismutase. in this study, the e. histolytica por gene and the adhe gene of a second amitochondriate protozoan parasite, giardia lamblia, were sequenced, and their phylogenetic positions were estimated in relation to por, adhe, and fd cloned from eukaryotic and eubacterial organisms. the e. histolytica por gene encodes a 1,620-amino-acid peptide that contained conserved iron-sulfur- and thiamine pyrophosphate-binding sites. the predicted e. histolytica por showed fewer positional identities to the por of g. lamblia (34%) than to the por of the enterobacterium klebsiella pneumoniae (49%), the cyanobacterium anabaena sp. (44%), and the protozoan trichomonas vaginalis (46%), which targets its por to anaerobic organelles called hydrogenosomes. maximum-likelihood, neighbor-joining, and parsimony analyses also suggested as less likely e. histolytica por sharing more recent common ancestry with g. lamblia por than with por of bacteria and the t. vaginalis hydrogenosome. the g. lamblia adhe encodes an 888-amino-acid fusion  peptide with an aldehyde dehydrogenase at its amino half and an iron-dependent (class 3) adh at its carboxy half. the predicted g. lamblia adhe showed extensive positional identities to adhe of escherichia coli (49%), clostridium acetobutylicum (44%), and e. histolytica (43%) and lesser identities to the class 3 adh of eubacteria and yeast (19 to 36%). phylogenetic analyses inferred a closer relationship of the e. histolytica adhe to bacterial adhe than to the g. lamblia adhe. the 6-kda fd of e. histolytica and g. lamblia were most similar to  those of the archaebacterium methanosarcina barkeri and the delta-purple bacterium desulfovibrio desulfuricans, respectively, while the 12-kda fd of the t. vaginalis hydrogenosome was most similar to the 12-kda fd of gamma-purple bacterium pseudomonas putida. e. histolytica genes (and probably g. lamblia genes) encoding fermentation enzymes therefore likely derive from bacteria by horizontal transfer, although it is not clear from which bacteria these amebic genes derive. these are the first nonorganellar fermentation enzymes of eukaryotes implicated to have derived from bacteria.

TI  == desulfovibrio profundus sp. nov., a novel barophilic sulfate-reducing bacterium from deep sediment layers in the japan sea.
AB  == several strains of a strictly anaerobic, vibrio-shaped or sigmoid, sulfate-reducing bacterium were isolated from deep marine sediments (depth, 80 and 500 m) obtained from the japan sea (ocean drilling program leg 128, site 798b). this bacterium was identified as a member of the genus desulfovibrio on the basis of the presence of desulfoviridin and characteristic phospholipid fatty acids (iso 17:1 omega 7 and iso 15:0), the small number of growth substrates utilized (lactate, pyruvate, and hydrogen), and 16s rrna gene sequence analysis data. based on data for 16s rrna sequences (1,369 bp), all of the japan sea strains were identical to each other and were most closely related to desulfovibrio salexigens and less closely related to desulfovibrio desulfuricans  (levels of similarity, 91 and 89.6%, respectively). there were, however, considerable phenotypic differences (in temperatures, pressures, and salinities tolerated, growth substrates, and electron donors) between the japan sea isolates and the type strains of previously described desulfovibrios, as well as important differences among the japan sea isolates. the japan sea isolates were active (with sulfide production) over a wide temperature range (15 to 65 degrees c) and  a wide sodium chloride concentration range (0.2 to 10%) (moderate halophile), and they were barophiles that were active at pressures up to about 40 mpa (400 atm).  the optimum pressures for activity corresponded to the calculated pressures at the depths from which the organisms were isolated (for isolates obtained at depths of 80 and 500 m the optimum activities occurred at 10 and 15 mpa, respectively [100 and 150 atm, respectively]). this confirms that the organisms came from deep sediments and indicates that they are well-adapted for deep sediment conditions, which is consistent with other characteristics (utilization  of hydrogen, fermentation, and utilization of ferric iron and organic sulfonates  as electron acceptors). we propose that japan sea isolate 500-1 is the type strain of a new species, desulfovibrio profundus.

AB  == a novel obligately intracellular bacterium, ileal symbiont intracellularis, which was obtained from the intestines of pigs with proliferative enteropathy disease,  was grown in pure cocultures with tissue cultures of rat cells. an examination of the 16s ribosomal dna gene sequence revealed that the isolates which we obtained  are members of the delta subdivision of the proteobacteria and that the sequences of these organisms exhibit a level of similarly of 91% with the sequence of desulfovibrio desulfuricans atcc 27774. these isolates were homogeneous and differed in cellular morphology, acid fastness, phenotype, electrophoretic protein profile, and habitat from desulfovibrio species. on the basis of the results of an integrated study of the phenotype and genotype of a consistent morphological entity found in particular porcine cells and associated with a well-defined clinical condition, we concluded that these bacteria belong to a previously undescribed genus and species, for which we propose the name lawsonia  intracellularis gen. nov., sp. nov. a species-specific recombinant dna probe was  cloned previously, and this probe was used to identify the bacterium in tissue culture cells and in the ileal epithelia of pigs with proliferative enteropathy disease. coculture of the organism with a rat enterocyte cell line allowed us to  designate strain nctc 12656 the type strain and to describe the new genus and species. the organism which we cultured is pathogenic for pigs and causes proliferative enteropathy lesions in their ilea and colons, and koch's postulates were fulfilled for this organism.

TI  == intracellular campylobacter-like organism from ferrets and hamsters with proliferative bowel disease is a desulfovibrio sp.
AB  == proliferative bowel disease is an intestinal disorder of a variety of domestic animals associated with the presence of an intracellular campylobacter-like organism (iclo). we have identified the iclo obtained from a ferret with proliferative colitis by 16s rrna sequence analysis. in this ferret, proliferative bowel tissue containing the iclo had translocated to the mesenteric lymph nodes, omentum, and liver. the 16s rrna genes of the iclo were amplified from an infected fragment of extraintestinal tissue by using universal prokaryotic primers. approximately 1,480 bases of the amplified 16s rrna gene were sequenced by cycle sequencing. comparison of the sequence of the iclo with those of over 400 bacteria in our data base indicated that the sequence of the iclo was most closely related to that of desulfovibrio desulfuricans (87.5% similarity). phylogenetic analysis with 12 desulfovibrio species and 20 species from related genera placed the iclo in a subcluster within the genus desulfovibrio with d. desulfuricans and 5 other desulfovibrio species. we will refer to this organism as the intracellular desulfovibrio organism (ido). specific primers were produced for pcr amplification of a 550-base fragment of the 16s rrna gene of the ido in proliferative intestinal tissue samples. this unique 550-base segment was amplified from samples of frozen intestinal tissue from nine ferrets and three hamsters with iclo-associated disease but not in four intestinal tissue samples from animals without the iclo-associated disease. the 550-base amplified products from the bowel tissues of one hamster and one ferret  were fully sequenced. the ferret ido partial sequence was identical to the previously determined 16s rrna sequence over its length, and the hamster ido sequence differed by a single base. the same intracellular organism has been identified in proliferative intestinal tissues of swine and that the organism has been successfully maintained in tissue culture. the availability of specific primers for pcr-based detection of this intracellular desulfovibrio organism will aid in the determination of its role in the pathogenesis of proliferative bowel disease in a variety of infected hosts.

TI  == properties of desulfovibrio carbinolicus sp. nov. and other sulfate-reducing bacteria isolated from an anaerobic-purification plant.
AB  == several sulfate-reducing microorganisms were isolated from an anaerobic-purification plant. four strains were classified as desulfovibrio desulfuricans, desulfovibrio sapovorans, desulfobulbus propionicus, and desulfovibrio sp. the d. sapovorans strain contained poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate granules and seemed to form extracellular vesicles. a fifth isolate, desulfovibrio sp. strain edk82, was a gram-negative, non-spore-forming, nonmotile, curved organism. it was able to oxidize several substrates, including  methanol. sulfate, sulfite, thiosulfate, and sulfur were utilized as electron acceptors. pyruvate, fumarate, malate, and glycerol could be fermented. because strain edk82 could not be ascribed to any of the existing species, a new species, desulfovibrio carbinolicus, is proposed. the doubling times of the isolates were  determined on several substrates. molecular hydrogen, lactate, propionate, and ethanol yielded the shortest doubling times (3.0 to 6.3 h). due to the presence of support material in an anaerobic filter system, these species were able to convert sulfate to sulfide very effectively at a hydraulic retention time as short as 0.5 h.

TI  == metabolism of polyethylene glycol by two anaerobic bacteria, desulfovibrio desulfuricans and a bacteroides sp.
AB  == two anaerobic bacteria were isolated from polyethylene glycol (peg)-degrading, methanogenic, enrichment cultures obtained from a municipal sludge digester. one  isolate, identified as desulfovibrio desulfuricans (strain dg2), metabolized oligomers ranging from ethylene glycol (eg) to tetraethylene glycol. the other isolate, identified as a bacteroides sp. (strain pg1), metabolized diethylene glycol and polymers of peg up to an average molecular mass of 20,000 g/mol [peg 20000; ho-(ch2-ch2-o-)nh]. both strains produced acetaldehyde as an intermediate, with acetate, ethanol, and hydrogen as end products. in coculture with a methanobacterium sp., the end products were acetate and methane. polypropylene glycol [ho-(ch2-ch2-ch2-o-)nh] was not metabolized by either bacterium, and methanogenic enrichments could not be obtained on this substrate. cell extracts of both bacteria dehydrogenated eg, pegs up to peg 400 in size, acetaldehyde, and other mono- and dihydroxylated compounds. extracts of bacteroides strain pg1 could not dehydrogenate long polymers of peg (greater than or equal to 1,000 g/mol), but the bacterium grew with peg 1000 or peg 20000 as a substrate and therefore possesses a mechanism for peg depolymerization not present in cell extracts. in contrast, extracts of d. desulfuricans dg2 dehydrogenated long polymers of peg, but whole cells did not grow with these polymers as substrates.  this indicated that the bacterium could not convert peg to a product suitable for uptake.

TI  == transformation of mercuric chloride and methylmercury by the rumen microflora.
AB  == the microflora in strained rumen fluid did not methylate or volatilize 203hg2+ at detectable rates. however, there was an exponential decay in the concentration of added ch3hg+, which was attributed to demethylation. the major product of demethylation was metallic mercury (hg0), and it was released as a volatile product from the reaction mixture. demethylation occurred under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions. the rate of demethylation was proportional to the concentration of added ch3hg+-hg from 0.02 to 100 microgram of hg per ml. the presence of hgcl2 had almost no inhibitory effect on the rate of cleavage of the  carbon-mercury bond of ch2hgcl, but it completely inhibited volatilization of the hg formed, when the concentration of hgcl2-hg reached 100 micrograms/ml. three of 11 species of anaerobic rumen bacteria catalyzed demethylation. these were desulfovibrio desulfuricans, selenomonas ruminantium, and megasphaera elsdenii. none of the 11 species caused detectable methylation, and only two caused limited volatilization of hg2+. three species of bacteria out of 90 fresh aerobic isolates from rumen contents were demethylators: two were identified as pseudomonas sp., and the third was a micrococcus sp. demethylation by the rumen microflora appeared to be carried out by both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and, on the basis of hg2+ sensitivity, probably resulted from the activity of two enzymes, a ch3-hg+ hydrolase and a hg2+ reductase.
