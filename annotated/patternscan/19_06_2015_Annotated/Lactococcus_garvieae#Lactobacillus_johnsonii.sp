TI  == microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of may bryndza cheese.
AB  == diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of may bryndza cheese, a traditional slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, e. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16s rdna and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. the culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese,  lactobacilli, lactococci and geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) cfu/g, 10(9) cfu/g and 10(5) cfu/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. the diversity of bacteria encompassed acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter guillouiae, acinetobacter sp., acinetobacter johnsonii, citrobacter braakii, clostridium bartlettii, corynebacterium callunae, corynebacterium maris, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter asburiae, enterobacter hormaechei, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus pallens, escherichia  coli, haemophilus haemolyticus, hafnia alvei, kluyvera cryocrescens, lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus garvieae, lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "leuconostoc garlicum", mannheimia glucosida, mannheimia haemolytica, pseudomonas sp., ps. fluorescens, "ps. reactans", raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, "rothia arfidiae", staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis, staph. felis, staph. pasteuri, staph. sciuri, staph. xylosus, streptococcus parauberis, str. thermophilus and variovorax paradoxus. the diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed alternaria alternata, "ascomycete sp.", aspergillus fumigatus, beauveria brongniartii, candida xylopsoci, c. inconspicua, cladosporium cladosporioides, debaromyces hansenii, fomes fomentarius, galactomyces candidus, gymnoascus reesii, chaetomium globosum, kluyveromyces marxianus, metarhizium anisopliae, penicillium aurantiogriseum, p. camemberti, p. freii, p. polonicum, p. viridicatum, pichia kudriavzevii, sordaria alcina, trichosporon lactis and yarrowia lipolytica.

TI  == enhanced expression of fucosyl ga1 in the digestive tract of immune-deficient scid, nude and pigr(-/-) mice.
AB  == fucosylation of ga1 in murine intestinal epithelia occurs through transcriptional induction of alpha1,2-fucosyltransferase along with bacterial infection, but the  mechanism has not been clearly characterized as to whether it is induced as a result of an immune response to bacteria or of genetic manipulation of the host by bacteria. accordingly, we analysed the expression of fucosyl ga1 (fga1) and fucosyltransferase activity in the digestive tracts of immune-deficient scid, nude and pigr(-/-) mice. in comparison with those in control mice bred under the  same spf circumstances, the amount of fga1 and the alpha1,2-fucosyltransferase activity were significantly increased in the immune-deficient mice, indicating that the immune system is not involved in induction of the alpha1,2-fucosyltransferase gene. reflecting the enhanced synthesis of fga1, the  total amounts of fga1 in the intestinal contents of immune-deficient mice were higher than those in control mice. also, the major faecal bacteria grown on a mrs agar plate were different in immune-deficient and control mice as follows, lactobacillus murinus for scid and pigr(-/-) mice, and lactobacillus johnsonii for their control, and enterococcus faecalis for nude mice and lactococcus garvieae for the control, indicating that an alteration in the intestinal lactobacilli is partly involved in the induction of alpha1,2-fucosyltransferase.

TI  == bacterial biodiversity of traditional zabady fermented milk.
AB  == the aim of this work was to identify the bacterial biodiversity of traditional zabady fermented milk using pcr-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (pcr-ttge) and pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge). most of the identified bacterial species in zabady samples belonged to lactic acid bacteria (lab), e.g., streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus garvieae, lactococcus raffinolactis, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and lactobacillus johnsonii. using the culture-dependent and independent methods, the streptococcal and lactococcal groups appeared to be the major bacterial species in zabady fermented milk, whereas the lactobacilli were the minor ones. the main dominant species was st. thermophilus followed by lc. garvieae. other molecular tools, e.g., species-specific pcr assay and cloning and sequencing strategy were used to confirm the ttge and dgge results. lc. garvieae, lc. raffinolactis, ln. citreum,  and lb. johnsonii were identified for the first time in this type of egyptian fermented milk.

TI  == isolation and molecular characterization of antibiotic-resistant lactic acid bacteria from poultry and swine meat products.
AB  == the transfer via the food chain from animals to humans of microbes that are resistant to antimicrobial agents is of increasing concern. to determine the contributions of nonpathogenic microflora to the occurrence and spread of antibiotic resistance (ar) genes in the food chain, 123 lactic acid bacteria were isolated from 29 samples of raw and processed pork and chicken meat products that had previously tested positive for one or more ar genes that encode clinically relevant ars: tet(m), tet(o), tet(k), erm(a), erm(b), erm(c), aac (6')-ie aph (2")-ia, meca, and blaz. all of the isolates were initially tested for their ar gene profiles by pcr. the 59 isolates carrying a tet, erm, or blaz gene were taken through molecular identification, analyzed by determination of the mic, and subjected to genetic fingerprinting. lactococcus garvieae was the predominant species (28 isolates), followed by lactobacillus plantarum (11 isolates) and l. salivarius (6 isolates), whereas lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, lactobacillus  johnsonii, l. reuteri, l. crispatus, and l. brevis were identified at lower frequencies. the tet(m) and erm(b) genes were the most frequently detected. assessment of multiple resistances in 18 tet positive (tet+) isolates revealed that tet(m) plus erm(b) and tet(k) plus erm(b) were the most frequent ar gene patterns. partial sequencing of the tet(m) open reading frame of three selected strains showed high sequence similarities (> 99%) with tet(m) genes previously found in human pathogens (listeria monocytogenes and neisseria meningitidis). southern hybridization with plasmid profiles revealed these strains contained tet(m)-carrying plasmids.
