TI  - Efficacy of an anaerobic swab transport system to maintain aerobic and anaerobic  microorganism viability after storage at -80 degrees C.
AB  - An Amies agar gel swab transport system was evaluated for its ability to maintain bacterial viability and relative quantity after freezing at -80 degrees C. Nine American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) bacterial strains were used: 3 anaerobic strains (Propionibacterium acnes, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Clostridium sporogenes) and 6 facultative or strict aerobic bacterial strains (Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Escherichia coli ([ATCC 25922 and ATCC 11775], Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Lactobacillus casei). The bacterial species were chosen because they corresponded to bacteria identified in psittacine feces and cloacal samples. There were no significant differences between growth scores at baseline and after storage at -80 degrees C for 40 days for any of the bacteria examined after 48 and 72 hr of incubation, with the exception of P. anaerobius. For P. anaerobius, there was a significant reduction (P < 0.001) in the growth score after storage at -80 degrees C for 40 days from that of the baseline; however, the bacteria were still viable. The tested swab transport system may be useful when lengthy storage and transport times necessitate freezing samples prior to culture.
TI  - [Bone and joint infections due to unusual pathogens].
AB  - Between 1989 and 1993, 7 patients--2 men and 5 women from 19 to 70 years of age--with osteomyelitis due to an unusual organism were observed. 3 cases with Salmonella typhimurium and one at a time with Escherichia coli, Peptostreptococcus, Propionibacterium acnes and Pasteurella multocida. 5 patients were treated operative accompanied with antibiotics and 1 without operation. 1 patient declined the indicated surgical therapy. The outcome were total healing in 3 cases, healing with ankylosis of the concerning joints in 2 cases and healing with defect in 1 case.
TI  - Impending rupture of nonaneurysmal bacterial aortitis: CT diagnosis.
AB  - The CT appearance of mycotic abdominal aortic aneurysms leading to eventual rupture has been well described. On the other hand, ruptured nonaneurysmal bacterial aortitis has not been demonstrated in the CT literature. We present two cases with subsequent rupture documented on CT. The characteristic findings of periaortic density and adjacent gas collection should suggest the diagnosis of acute aortic infection. This may herald impending rupture, even in the absence of aneurysmal dilatation, and should direct therapy accordingly.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of aerobic and anaerobic polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
AB  - Human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) were made anaerobic by nitrogen washout (oxygen saturation <1%, Eh < -42 mV at pH 7.0), and the ability of the cells to kill bacteria was assayed and compared to the bactericidal activity of aerobic PMN. Anaerobic PMN were able to kill Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus, viridans streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Peptococcus magnus normally. Organisms that were not killed normally by anaerobic PMN included Staphylococcus aureus (strains Wood 46 and 502a), Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Salmonella typhimurium. These findings suggest that mechanisms other than those dependent on hydrogen peroxide may be important in the killing of some bacteria.
