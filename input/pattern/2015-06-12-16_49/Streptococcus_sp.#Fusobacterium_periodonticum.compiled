TI  - Influence of the Periodontal Status on the Initial-Biofilm Formation on Titanium  Surfaces.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dental implants will be exposed to a complex ecosystem once they are  placed in the oral cavity. The bacterial colonization and biofilm formation on these devices will depend not only on the physicochemical surface implant properties but also on the periodontal health conditions of the patients, as these devices are exposed. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to correlate the subgingival microbial profile with the composition of initial biofilm formed on different microstructured titanium (Ti) surfaces. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten periodontitis and 10 periodontally healthy subjects were included in this study. The subjects wore a removable acrylic device with four different fixed Ti surfaces for 48 hours. Microbial samples of subgingival plaque and the biofilm formed on each Ti surface were individually analyzed by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique. RESULTS: Despite the roughness or hydrophilicity of the Ti surfaces, a characteristic pattern of bacterial adhesion was observed on each of the study groups. However, significant differences in the proportion of the species that colonized the Ti surfaces were found between the periodontitis and periodontally healthy groups. Treponema denticola, Neisseria mucosa, Eikenella corrodens, and Tannerella forsythia were detected in higher proportions on the Ti disks placed in the periodontitis subjects, while significant higher proportions of Capnocytophaga sputigena, Fusobacterium periodonticum, Prevotella melaninogenica, and Streptococcus mitis were detected on the Ti disks placed in the periodontally healthy group. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained in this study shows that the composition and the proportion of the species that initially colonize Ti surfaces are highly influenced by the periodontal status more than the surface characteristics of the Ti implant.
TI  - Microbial diversity in persistent root canal infections investigated by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of the present study was to investigate the composition of  the root canal microbiota in endodontic failures in order to identify and quantify these microorganisms. METHODS: Microbiological samples were taken from 36 root canals with persistent endodontic infection. The presence, levels, and proportions of 79 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to investigate the relations between bacterial counts and clinical conditions (P </= .05). RESULTS: Enterococcus faecium (36%), Streptococcus epidermidis (36%), Eubacterium saburreum (28%), Parvimonas micra (28%), Streptococcus sanguis (28%), Capnocytophaga sputigena (28%), Leptotrichia buccalis (28%), Enterococcus faecalis (28%), and Staphylococcus warneri (28%) were the most prevalent species; and there was a low prevalence of Treponema socranskii (3%), Fusobacterium periodonticum (3%), Capnocytophaga gingivalis (3%), and Spiroplasma ixodetis (3%). The highest mean levels were found for the following species: E. faecium, Dialister pneumosintes, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Helicobacter pylori. There was a statistically significant difference between the levels of gram-negative species and gram-positive species (13.5 x 10(5) vs 6.5 x 10(5), respectively). A positive correlation was found between the area of the periapical lesion and the levels of gram-negative and rod species (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The microbiota from teeth with persistent apical periodontitis presents a mixed and complex profile, hosting E. faecium and S. epidermidis as the most highly prevalent species. No correlation was found between any of the species tested and clinical findings; however, periapical lesions with the largest areas presented higher counts of gram-negative and rod species.
TI  - Phototargeting human periodontal pathogens in vivo.
AB  - The effects of blue light at 455 nm were investigated on the bacterial composition of human dental plaque in vivo. Eleven subjects who refrained from brushing for 3 days before and during phototherapy participated in the study. Light with a power density of 70 mW/cm(2) was applied to the buccal surfaces of premolar and molar teeth on one side of the mouth twice daily for 2 min over a period of 4 days. Dental plaque was harvested at baseline and again at the end of 4 days from eight posterior teeth on both the exposed side and unexposed sides of the mouth. Microbiological changes were monitored by checkerboard DNA probe analysis of 40 periodontal bacteria. The proportions of black-pigmented species Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia were significantly reduced on the exposed side from their original proportions by 25 and 56 %, respectively, while no change was observed to the unexposed side. Five other species showed the greatest proportional reduction of the light-exposed side relative to the unexposed side. These species were Streptococcus intermedius, Fusobacterium nucleatum ss. vincentii, Fusobacterium nucleatum ss. polymorphum, Fusobacterium periodonticum, and Capnocytophaga sputigena. At the same time, the percentage of gingival areas scored as being red decreased on the side exposed to light from 48 to 42 %, whereas the percentage scored as red increased on the unexposed side from 53 to 56 %. No adverse effects were found or reported in this study. The present study proposes a new method to modify the ecosystem in dental plaque by phototherapy and introduces a new avenue of prophylactic treatment for periodontal diseases.
TI  - Adjunctive azithromycin in the treatment of aggressive periodontitis: microbiological findings of a 12-month randomized clinical trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the subgingival microbiological outcomes of azithromycin or placebo as adjuncts to scaling and root planing (SRP) in the treatment of aggressive periodontitis (AgP), and to secondarily evaluate the microbiological effect of supragingival scaling in AgP patients. METHODS: Twenty-four AgP subjects 13-26 years of age received a 15-day programme of supragingival scaling (SC) and were then randomly assigned to SRP with systemic azithromycin or placebo. Subgingival samples were taken with sterile paper points at baseline, 15 days after SC, and at 3, 6 and 12 months following SRP. Microbiological analysis was performed by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: Changes in bacterial levels from baseline to 15 days after SC were similar in the 2 groups. When subjects were analysed as a single group, significant reductions after SC were observed for Actinomyces gerencseriae, Capnocytophaga ochracea, and Treponema denticola. During the 12-month follow-up, levels of most of the bacteria decreased in both groups in a similar pattern. For instance, Actinomyces israelli, Veillonella parvula, Streptococcus gordonii, C. ochracea, Eikenella corrodens, Eubacterium nodatum, Fusobacterium periodonticum and Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum decreased significantly within the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Azithromycin was ineffective in lowering the subgingival levels of important putative periodontal pathogens in young AgP subjects compared to placebo. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Scaling and root planing with adjunctive systemic azithromycin provides little additional benefit compared to placebo in reductions of major subgingival periodontal pathogens.
TI  - Periodontal status of patients with dentin dysplasia type I: report of three cases within a family.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dentin dysplasia type I (DDI) is a rare hereditary disturbance of dentin formation. It is characterized by clinically normal-appearing crowns; obliteration of pulp chambers; and short, blunted and malformed roots that are commonly associated with periodontal attachment loss (PAL). In this context, we report three cases within a family with similar clinical and radiographic features of DDI but with differing microbiologic and periodontal conditions. METHODS: A 42-year-old white female and her two daughters (25 and 10 years of age) presented with a diagnosis of DDI. Probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), visible plaque, and bleeding on probing (BOP) were recorded. Subgingival biofilm samples were randomly collected and analyzed by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: The mother presented 34.9% of sites with PD > or =4 mm, 41.3% of sites with CAL > or =4 mm, and 57% of sites with BOP; both daughters presented no sites with PD or CAL >3 mm and <10% of sites with BOP. Microbiologic analysis detected Gemella morbillorum, Neisseria mucosa, and Staphylococcus aureus in > or =50% of the mother's samples. The daughters showed high levels (>10(4) bacterial cells) of some periodontopathic bacteria, including members of the red (Porphyromonas gingivalis) and orange (Fusobacterium periodonticum and F. nucleatum polymorphum) complexes and beneficial species of the yellow (Streptococcus gordonii) and purple (Veillonella parvula) complexes. The mother presented high mean levels only for four tested species (N. mucosa, Prevotella melaninogenica, Treponema denticola, and V. parvula). CONCLUSION: A combination of radiographs, microbiologic analysis, and preventive professional monitoring care is important to avoid PAL and to provide oral health in patients with DDI.
TI  - Salivary microbiota of HIV-positive children and its correlation with HIV status, oral diseases, and total secretory IgA.
AB  - AIM: This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and levels of salivary microorganisms in HIV-positive children, and their correlation to HIV status, oral lesions, and salivary IgA levels. DESIGN: Forty-two HIV-positive and 36 control children were clinically examined, had their saliva collected and processed for the microbiological analysis of 38 bacterial taxa by the checkerboard method, and salivary IgA quantification by ELISA. RESULTS: The majority of the species tested were more prevalent in control children than in the HIV group. Mean concentration of total salivary IgA was similar in both groups. High levels of Veillonella parvula were found in children with cheilitis and herpes. Tannerella forsythia, Eikenella Corrodens, and Propionibacterium acnes were prevalent in children with gingivitis, while Fusobacterium periodonticum, Streptococcus gordonii, and Streptococcus oralis were significantly more frequent in children with no oral lesions. Significant negative correlations between salivary IgA levels and Eubacterium nodatum and oral streptococci were observed (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: HIV-seropositive children presented significantly lower prevalence and levels of several bacterial species in saliva; HIV-positive children are able to mount a mucosal immune response; HIV-seropositive children under highly active antiretroviral therapy presented low prevalence of oral lesions.
TI  - Comparison of bacterial plaque samples from titanium implant and tooth surfaces by different methods.
AB  - Studies have shown similarities in the microflora between titanium implants or tooth sites when samples are taken by gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) sampling methods. The purpose of the present study was to study the microflora from curette and GCF samples using the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method to assess the microflora of patients who had at least one oral osseo-integrated implant and who were otherwise dentate. Plaque samples were taken from tooth/implant surfaces and from sulcular gingival surfaces with curettes, and from gingival fluid using filter papers. A total of 28 subjects (11 females) were enrolled in the study. The mean age of the subjects was 64.1 years (SD+/-4.7). On average, the implants studied had been in function for 3.7 years (SD+/-2.9). The proportion of Streptococcus oralis (P<0.02) and Fusobacterium periodonticum (P<0.02) was significantly higher at tooth sites (curette samples). The GCF samples yielded higher proportions for 28/40 species studies (P-values varying between 0.05 and 0.001). The proportions of Tannerella forsythia (T. forsythensis), and Treponema denticola were both higher in GCF samples (P<0.02 and P<0.05, respectively) than in curette samples (implant sites). The microbial composition in gingival fluid from samples taken at implant sites differed partly from that of curette samples taken from implant surfaces or from sulcular soft tissues, providing higher counts for most bacteria studied at implant surfaces, but with the exception of Porphyromonas gingivalis. A combination of GCF and curette sampling methods might be the most representative sample method.
TI  - Distribution of selected bacterial species on intraoral surfaces.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: To examine the proportions of 40 bacterial species in samples from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces and saliva in systemically healthy adult subjects and to compare these microbiotas with those of supra- and subgingival plaque. METHODS: Microbial samples were taken from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces of 225 systemically healthy subjects using a "buccal brush". Saliva was taken by expectoration. Forty-four of these subjects provided additional supra- and subgingival plaque samples. Samples were individually evaluated for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. The percentage of total DNA probe count was determined for each species, at each sample location and averaged across subjects. The significance of differences among the proportions of the 40 test species at different sample locations was sought in the 225 and 44 subjects separately using the Quade test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. Cluster analysis was performed using the proportions of the 40 species at the different sample locations using the minimum similarity coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. The proportions of each species were averaged across subjects in the resulting cluster groups and the significance of differences was tested using the t-test and ANOVA. RESULTS: Microbial profiles differed markedly among sample locations in the 225 subjects, with 34 of 40 species differing significantly. Proportions of Veillonella parvula and Prevotella melaninogenica were higher in saliva and on the lateral and dorsal surfaces of the tongue, while Streptococcus mitis and S. oralis were in significantly lower proportions in saliva and on the tongue dorsum. Cluster analysis resulted in the formation of 2 clusters with >85% similarity. Cluster 1 comprised saliva, lateral and dorsal tongue surfaces, while Cluster 2 comprised the remaining soft tissue locations. V. parvula, P. melaninogenica, Eikenella corrodens, Neisseria mucosa, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Fusobacterium periodonticum, F. nucleatum ss vincentii and Porphyromonas gingivalis were in significantly higher proportions in Cluster 1 and S. mitis, S. oralis and S. noxia were significantly higher in Cluster 2. These findings were confirmed using data from the 44 subjects providing plaque samples. The microbial profiles of supra- and subgingival plaque differed from the other sample locations, particularly in the increased proportions of the Actinomyces species. Species of different genera exhibited different proportions on the various intraoral surfaces, but even within the genus Streptococcus, there were differences in colonization patterns. S. oralis, S. mitis and S. constellatus colonized the soft tissues and saliva in higher proportions than the samples from the teeth, while the other 4 streptococcal species examined colonized the dental surfaces in proportions comparable to the soft tissue locations and saliva. CONCLUSIONS: Proportions of bacterial species differed markedly on different intraoral surfaces. The microbiota of saliva was most similar to that of the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the tongue. The microbiotas of the soft tissues resembled each other more than the microbiotas that colonized the teeth both above and below the gingival margin.
TI  - Microbiological evaluation of acute periradicular abscesses by DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present investigation was to examine the microbiota of acute periradicular abscesses of endodontic origin by using a molecular genetic method. STUDY DESIGN: Pus was collected by aspiration from 27 cases diagnosed as acute abscesses of endodontic origin, and DNA was extracted to evaluate the occurrence of 49 bacterial species by using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. The presence of bacterial DNA in clinical samples was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction with ubiquitous bacterial 16S rRNA gene primers. RESULTS: The results of the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization analysis revealed that 37 of the 49 DNA probes tested were reactive with one or more samples. The number of bacterial species in the pus samples ranged from 1 to 33 (mean, 5.9). Eighteen of the 27 pus samples were positive for at least one DNA probe. The most prevalent species found were: Bacteroides forsythus (29.6% of the cases); Porphyromonas gingivalis (29.6%); Streptococcus constellatus (25.9%), Prevotella intermedia (22.2%), Prevotella nigrescens (22.2%), Fusobacterium periodonticum (18.5%), Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies nucleatum (18.5%), and Eikenella corrodens (18.5%). CONCLUSIONS: The microbiologic data of the present investigation indicated that molecular genetic methods could provide additional knowledge regarding the microbiota of acute periradicular abscesses by detecting bacterial species that are difficult--or even impossible--to grow.
TI  - Change in subgingival microbial profiles in adult periodontitis subjects receiving either systemically-administered amoxicillin or metronidazole.
AB  - AIM: The current investigation evaluated changes in levels and proportions of 40  bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples during, immediately after and up to 1 year after metronidazole or amoxicillin therapy combined with SRP. METHOD: After baseline clinical and microbiological monitoring, 17 adult periodontitis subjects received full mouth SRP and 14 days systemic administration of either metronidazole (250 mg, TID, n=8) or amoxicillin (500 mg, TID, n=9). Clinical measurements including % of sites with plaque, gingival redness, bleeding on probing and suppuration, pocket depth (PD) and attachment level (AL) were made at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of all teeth in each subject at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days and from 2 randomly selected posterior teeth at 3, 7, and 14 days during and after antibiotic administration. Counts of 40 subgingival species were determined using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Significance of differences over time was determined using the Quade test and between groups using ANCOVA. RESULTS: Mean PD was reduced from 3.22+/-0.12 at baseline to 2.81+/-0.16 (p<0.01) at 360 days and from 3.38+/-0.23 mm to 2.80+/-0.14 mm (p<0.01) in the amoxicillin and metronidazole treated subjects respectively. Corresponding values for mean AL were 3.21+/-0.30 to 2.76+/-0.32 (p<0.05) and 3.23+/-0.28 mm to 2.94+/-0.23 mm (p<0.01). Levels and proportions of Bacteroides forsythus, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola were markedly reduced during antibiotic administration and were lower than baseline levels at 360 days. Counts (x10(5), +/-SEM) of B. forsythus fell from baseline levels of 0.66+/-0.16 to 0.04+/-0.02, 0.13+/-0.04, 0.10+/-0.03 and 0.42+/-0.19 in the amoxicillin group at 14, 90, 180 and 360 days respectively (p<0.001). Corresponding values for metronidazole treated subjects were: 1.69+/-0.28 to 0.02+/-0.01, 0.20+/-0.08, 0.22+/-0.06 and 0.22+/-0.08 (p<0.001). Counts of Campylobacter species, Eubacterium nodatum, Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, F. periodonticum and Prevotella nigrescens were also detected at lower mean levels during and immediately after therapy, but gradually increased after withdrawal of the antibiotics. Members of the genera Actinomyces, Streptococcus and Capnocytophaga were minimally affected by metronidazole. However, amoxicillin decreased the counts and proportions of Actinomyces species during and after therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that metronidazole and amoxicillin are useful in rapidly lowering counts of putative periodontal pathogens, but must be accompanied by other procedures to bring about periodontal stability.
TI  - Microbiological parameters associated with IL-1 gene polymorphisms in periodontitis patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND, AIMS: Polymorphisms in the cluster of IL-1 genes have been significantly associated with the severity of adult periodontitis. The purpose of this study was to compare microbiological parameters in IL-1 genotype negative and positive adult subjects with a range of periodontitis severities. METHOD: The study included 108 subjects in good general health. Clinical parameters were recorded at 6 sites/tooth excluding 3rd molars and included: plaque accumulation, gingival erythema, bleeding on probing, suppuration, pocket depth and attachment level. Subgingival plaque samples were collected from the mesiobuccal surface of up to 28 teeth in each subject (mean 25.3) providing a total of 2736 samples. The levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in each sample using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Fingerstick blood samples were collected for IL-1A (+4845) and IL-1B (+3954) genotyping using PCR-based methods. RESULTS: The proportion of IL-1 genotype positive subjects that exhibited mean counts of specific subgingival species above selected thresholds was significantly higher than the proportion of genotype negative subjects. Prominent among species that were detected at higher levels in genotype positive subjects were members of the "red" and "orange" complexes and included: Bacteroides forsythus, Treponema denticola, the Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, Fusobacterium periodonticum, Campylobacter gracilis, Campylobacter showae and Streptococcus constellatus. Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus gordonii and 3 Capnocytophaga species were also detected more frequently at high numbers in genotype positive subjects. Significantly higher mean counts of B. forsythus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, T. denticola, the F. nucleatum subspecies, F. periodonticum, Campylobacter rectus, C. showae, Eubacterium nodatum, S. constellatus, S. gordonii, and S. intermedius were detected at periodontal pockets >6 mm in subjects who were genotype positive when compared with genotype negative subjects. The increase was due to increased numbers of cells of these species rather than a major shift in proportion. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that genotype positive subjects more frequently had higher levels of "red" and "orange" complex species that are known to be strongly associated with measures of periodontal inflammation.
TI  - Microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  - It has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. The purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. The presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. Similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. Community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. One complex consisted of the tightly related group: Bacteroides forsythus, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola. The 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the Fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens and Peptostreptococcus micros. Species associated with this group included: Eubacterium nodatum, Campylobacter rectus, Campylobacter showae, Streptococcus constellatus and Campylobacter gracilis. The 3rd complex consisted of Streptococcus sanguis, S. oralis, S. mitis, S. gordonii and S. intermedius. The 4th complex was comprised of 3 Capnocytophaga species, Campylobacter concisus, Eikenella corrodens and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. The 5th complex consisted of Veillonella parvula and Actinomyces odontolyticus. A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, Selenomonas noxia and Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (A. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. The 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.
