TI  == comparison of lipopolysaccharides from bacteroides, porphyromonas, prevotella, campylobacter and wolinella spp. by tricine-sds-page.
AB  == lipopolysaccharides (lpss) of 11 bacterial strains from the type species of the genera bacteroides (b. fragilis), prevotella (pr. melaninogenica), porphyromonas  (po. gingivalis), campylobacter (c. fetus subsp. fetus), and wolinella (w. succinogenes), and from the type strains of b. distasonis, b. forsythus, b. ureolyticus, po. levii, po. macacae, and c. gracilis, were extracted with hot water-phenol (westphal method). s-form lpss, obtained from all organisms, were well resolved with tricine-sodium-dodecyl-sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by silver staining. lipid a was not stained. also  profiles from lps of escherichia coli, serotypes 0111:b4 and 055:b5, could be distinguished. while w. succinogenes showed a relatively short s-form lps on electrophoregrams, the other bacteria, including b. fragilis, exhibited long-ladder lpss. po. gingivalis displayed the largest number of bands and the longest o-chain. the long o-chain of this bacterium may be important for its virulence.
