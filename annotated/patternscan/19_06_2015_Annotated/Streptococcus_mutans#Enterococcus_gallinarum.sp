TI  == cloning of insertion sequence is1485 from enterococcus species.
AB  == we have cloned and identified an insertion sequence, is1485, that was present in  several members of the genus enterococcus. is1485 exists in varying copy numbers  with at least 12 copies in e. durans (atcc 11576), 3 copies in e. faecium (atcc 19434), and one copy each in e. faecalis (atcc 19433) and e. avium (atcc 14024).  it was also detected in clinical strains of e. gallinarum, e. casseliflavus, and  e. saccharolyticus. is1485 is 1366 bp in length, it has imperfect terminal inverted repeats with 25 of the terminal 39 residues matched, and it contains three open reading frames exceeding 50 codons, designated orfa, orfb, and orfc. the largest, orfb, was located 36 bp downstream and in the -1 reading frame relative to orfa; orfc is oriented in the opposite direction and overlaps orfa. the genetic organization of is1485 resembles that of members of the is3 family of transposable elements. sequence homology exists with several members of the is3 family especially with is199 from streptococcus mutans.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of streptococcus.
AB  == a numerical taxonomic study of strains of streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. the major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (s. faecalis, s. faecium, 's. avium' and a proposed new species 's. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (s. bovis, s. equinus, s. salivarius, 's. casseliflavus', s. mutans, s. raffinolactis and an unidentified oral group i); (c) lactic species group (s. lactis including s. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (s. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (s. mitis, s. sanguis, a proposed new species 's. oralis' and 's. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. equi, 's. equisimilis' including 's. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of lancefield group b strains of human origin);  (g) parapyogenic species group (s. uberis, 's. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of lancefield groups r, s and t). species of aerococcus, gemella, leuconostoc and pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.
