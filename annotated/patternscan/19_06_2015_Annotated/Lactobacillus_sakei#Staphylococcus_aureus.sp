TI  == the cyclic antibacterial peptide enterocin as-48: isolation, mode of action, and  possible food applications.
AB  == enterocin as-48 is a circular bacteriocin produced by enterococcus. it contains a 70 amino acid-residue chain circularized by a head-to-tail peptide bond. the conformation of enterocin as-48 is arranged into five alpha-helices with a compact globular structure. enterocin as-48 has a wide inhibitory spectrum on gram-positive bacteria. sensitivity of gram-negative bacteria increases in combination with outer-membrane permeabilizing treatments. eukaryotic cells are bacteriocin-resistant. this cationic peptide inserts into bacterial membranes and causes membrane permeabilization, leading ultimately to cell death. microarray analysis revealed sets of up-regulated and down-regulated genes in bacillus cereus cells treated with sublethal bacteriocin concentration. enterocin as-48 can be purified in two steps or prepared as lyophilized powder from cultures in whey-based substrates. the potential applications of enterocin as-48 as a food biopreservative have been corroborated against foodborne pathogens and/or toxigenic bacteria (listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica) and spoilage bacteria (alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris, bacillus spp., paenibacillus spp., geobacillus stearothermophilus, brochothrix thermosphacta, staphylococcus carnosus, lactobacillus sakei and other spoilage lactic acid bacteria). the efficacy of enterocin as-48 in food systems increases greatly in combination with chemical preservatives, essential oils, phenolic compounds, and physico-chemical treatments such as sublethal heat, high-intensity pulsed-electric fields or high  hydrostatic pressure.

TI  == detection, partial purification and characterization of bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus brevis fptlb3 isolated from freshwater fish: bacteriocin from lb. brevis fptlb3.
AB  == lactobacillus brevis fptlb3 was isolated from freshwater fish, capable of producing bacteriocin that had broad spectrum of inhibition (3200 au/ml) against  escherichia coli mtcc 1563, enterococcus faecalis mtcc 2729, lactobacillus casei  mtcc 1423, lactobacillus sakei atcc 15521 and staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923. the antimicrobial activity of crude supernatant fluid was stable after heating at 121 degrees c for 60 min and declined thereafter. stability of antimicrobial activity was observed at ph range of 2.0 to 8.0. its active principle was proteinaceous in nature since the bacteriocin was inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, but not by other non-proteolytic enzymes. mitomycin c and uv light did not affect the activity of the bacteriocin, while chloroform extraction completely destroyed their activity. exposure to surfactant resulted in an increase in titre, except nonidet p-40, which led to total loss of activity. no bacteriocin adsorption was detected at ph 1 to 2, whereas 100% bacteriocin adsorption was found at ph 6.5. based on tricine sds-page the estimated molecular mass of bacteriocin was 54 kda. no plasmid was found to present in the isolate.

TI  == behavior of salmonella spp., listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus in chourico de vinho, a dry fermented sausage made from wine-marinated meat.
AB  == portuguese chourico de vinho is made by drying coarsely minced meat and fat that  has been previously marinated with wine (usually red), salt, and garlic for 1 to  2 days at a low temperature (4 to 8 degrees c). this procedure may improve the microbiological safety of the product. the aim of this study was to evaluate the  behavior of three pathogens in this product, salmonella spp., listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus, to establish the minimum period of drying and maturation necessary to render safe products. the pathogens were inoculated in the chourico de vinho batter. a factorial design was used to study  the following variables in the fermentation process: (i) the presence or absence  of an indigenous lactobacillus sakei starter culture; (ii) the presence or absence of fermentable carbohydrates; and (iii) the salt level (1.5 or 3%). the samples were analyzed 24 h after the preparation of the batter (at stuffing); after 7, 15, and 30 days of drying; and after 30 days of storage at 4 degrees c under vacuum. under all of the conditions studied, the levels of the three pathogens decreased during the drying period. in the early stages of drying, the  addition of l. sakei starter culture and/or carbohydrates resulted in lower levels of gram-positive pathogens. after 15 days of drying, populations of all pathogens decreased by ca. 2 log in all samples. at that sampling time, l. monocytogenes was undetectable in the chourico de vinho with l. sakei starter culture and carbohydrates. the mean count of s. aureus after 15 days of drying was below 1 log cfu/g. after 30 days of drying, no pathogens were detected. the drying period could be shortened to 15 days when considering only the gram-positive pathogens studied and the use of a starter culture and carbohydrates. due to the low infective dose of salmonella spp., the product should be considered safe after 30 days, when this pathogen became undetectable.

TI  == development of bacteria identification array to detect lactobacilli in thai fermented sausage.
AB  == to improve the quality and safety of food products, there is a need in the food industry for a reliable method for simultaneously monitoring multiple bacterial strains. microarray technology is a high-throughput screening approach that can provide an alternative for bacteria detection. a total of 164 bacteria-specific probes were designed from 16s rrna gene sequences to target 12 bacteria species,  including lactic acid bacteria and selected food pathogens. after fabrication onto aminosilane-coated slides, hybridization conditions of the array were optimized for high specificity and signal intensities. the array was applied to detect 12 bacteria individually and was specific to all (lactobacillus plantarum  group, l. fermentum, l. brevis, l. delbrueckii, l. casei, l. sakei, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus and listeria monocytogenes) except l. animalis. multiplex detection using mixed bacteria populations was evaluated and accurate detection was obtained. the feasibility of using the array to detect the target bacteria in food was evaluated with thai fermented sausages  (nham). meat samples were collected on days 2, 3 and 7 after natural fermentation, l. plantarum-inoculated fermentation and l. brevis-inoculated fermentation before applying to the array. the naturally-fermented nham contained l. sakei, l. delbrueckii, l. plantarum and l. fermentum. the l. plantarum-inoculated nham showed a similar lactic acid bacteria population but the positive signal level for l. plantarum was higher than with natural fermentation. the l. brevis-inoculated nham contained l. brevis, l. plantarum, l. delbrueckii and l. fermentum. the array was used to monitor bacteria population dynamics during the fermentation process. the naturally-fermented and l. brevis-inoculated samples showed lower positive signal levels of l. plantarum on  day 2, but signals gradually increased on days 3 and 7 of the fermentation. in contrast, the l. plantarum-started fermentation showed a higher positive signal level on day 2 than the natural and l. brevis-inoculated samples, and the positive signal level remained high on days 3 and 7. the bacteria identification  array was proven to be useful as an alternative method to detect and monitor target bacteria populations during food fermentation.

TI  == lactobacillus sakei crl1862 improves safety and protein hydrolysis in meat systems.
AB  == aims: the capacity of lactobacillus sakei crl1862 to prevent the growth of pathogens and its ability to degrade sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar proteins in pork meat systems was evaluated. in addition, basic safety aspects of lact. sakei crl1862 such as production of biogenic amines and antibiotic susceptibility were  addressed. methods and results: the bacteriocin-producing lact. sakei crl1862 showed respectively bactericide and bacteriostatic effect against listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus in beaker sausage assay during 9 days of  storage at 22 degrees c. the hydrolytic effect of lact. sakei crl1862 on protein  extracts was evaluated by sds-page and reverse phase hplc. a more pronounced proteolysis was evidenced in inoculated sarcoplasmic proteins compared with myofibrillar extracts with the generation of predominantly hydrophilic peptides and increase of total free amino acids concentration. lactobacillus sakei crl1862 produced neither histamine nor tyrosine and exhibited no resistance to the antibiotics assayed. conclusions: lactobacillus sakei crl1862 effectively controlled the growth of l. monocytogenes and staph. aureus; moreover, it was able to hydrolyse pork meat extracts generating peptides and amino acids, which may improve hygienic and sensorial attributes of fermented meat products. significance and impact of the study: the use of an integrated approach to evaluate the major traits of lact. sakei crl1862 showed it can be applied as an autochthonous functional starter in meat fermentation.

TI  == effect of brine marination on survival and growth of spoilage and pathogenic bacteria during processing and subsequent storage of ready-to-eat shrimp (pandalus borealis).
AB  == the effect of brine marination at chill temperatures on survival and growth of spoilage and pathogenic bacteria during processing and subsequent storage of ready-to-eat cold water shrimp was studied. survival and growth of lactobacillus  sakei, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella, staphylococcus aureus and vibrio parahaemolyticus were examined. the effect of brine composition and ph was determined in 12 screening experiments without addition of shrimp. sixteen challenge tests with shrimp were then carried out to examine the effect of brine  composition and storage temperature on survival and growth during processing and  subsequent storage of brined and drained shrimp in modified atmosphere packaging  (map). different brines with (i) acetic and lactic acids (al) or (ii) benzoic, citric and sorbic acids (bcs) were studied. v. parahaemolyticus was inactivated in brine al without shrimp whereas concentrations of all the examined microorganisms were reduced in brine bcs. a significant effect of brine ph on inactivation was observed and inactivation during chill marination of shrimp in brine was reduced compared to the effect of brine alone. this was explained by a  relatively fast increase of ph in the brine during marination of shrimp. for shrimp in brine bcs, reductions were observed for v. parahaemolyticus and salmonella, whereas inactivation in shrimp was only noticed for salmonella in brine al. the observed reductions were too small to be used in practise for decontamination of shellfish. none of the examined pathogens was able to grow at  7 degrees c in brined and drained map shrimp that resembled commercial products.  however, reducing the concentration of acetic and lactic acids by 50% resulted in relatively fast growth of l. monocytogenes in brined and drained map shrimp at 7  degrees c. growth of s. aureus and salmonella was observed in similar products stored at 15 degrees c. v. parahaemolyticus was reduced in brined and drained map shrimp stored at both 7 and 15 degrees c. based on the results of the present study, l. monocytogenes was identified as the greatest potential risk with respect to the safety of brined and drained map shrimp. the potential of l. sakei as spoilage bacterium in brined and drained map shrimp was confirmed. importantly, growth rates of l. sakei and l. monocytogenes in brined and drained  map shrimp were predicted accurately by available mathematical models. thus, these models can be used for product development and establishment of shell-life  for ready-to-eat shrimp taking into account both quality and safety aspects.

TI  == identification of staphylococci and dominant lactic acid bacteria in spontaneously fermented swiss meat products using pcr-rflp.
AB  == pathogenic, spoilage, and technologically important microorganisms were monitored in 21 spontaneously fermented swiss meat products manufactured with meat from wildlife or animals grown in natural habitat. thereby, pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) on rpob and 16s rrna gene sequences provided a powerful tool for fast and accurate identification of the main microbial population. lactobacillus sakei and lactobacillus curvatus dominated in fermented meat products followed by staphylococcus species, which constituted 88.2% of all  gram-positive, catalase-positive cocci (gcc(+)) with cell counts varying from 2.6 to 7.0 log cfu/g during maturation. staphylococcus equorum was prevalent in frequency and cell counts during maturation (18.0%; 5.0-7.3 log cfu/g) and in the end products (28.4%; 1.8-6.2 log cfu/g) implicating a new presumptive starter species for meat fermentation. nine out of 14 end products indicated safety risks to consumers due to the high incidence of staphylococcus saprophyticus or staphylococcus epidermidis combined with cell counts of 7.4 and 4.9 log cfu/g, respectively. this fact was supported by the detection of staphylococcus aureus and enterobacteriaceae in ready-to-eat products strongly exceeding the tolerable  limit of 2 log cfu/g. spontaneously fermented meat products produced from wildlife or animals grown in natural habitats not only gave rise to hygienic and  safety concerns but also provided new presumptive starter strains.

TI  == bio-control of waterborne pathogens using lactobacillus spp.
AB  == bacteria play a significant role in water contamination. chemicals are mostly used for the treatment of bacteriologically contaminated water. the use of bacterial interactions is a new approach to limit the pathogens' growth. detection of antimicrobial substances produced by lactic acid bacteria against the waterborne pathogens is the objective of this work. microbiological and biochemical methods were used to identify lactic acid bacteria having an antimicrobial activity. evaluation of antimicrobial activity with growth kinetic  measurements was performed. four isolates of lactic acid bacteria obtained from whey and curd were identified. the predominant species belonging to the lactobacillus genera are: lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus paracasei, and lactobacillus paraplantarum. the present study revealed that the lactobacillus consortium is able to inhibit staphylococcus aureus's growth along with escherichia coli and vibrio species. in mixed culture, after 24 h, the lactobacillus consortium reduces the growth of s. aureus by 2.03  log; moreover, the growth of the latter bacteria totally ceased after 72 h of incubation. the protein produced by the lactobacillus consortium was responsible  for arresting the growth of s. aureus.

TI  == microbiological quality and safety of raw milk and soft cheese and detection of autochthonous lactic acid bacteria with antagonistic activity against listeria monocytogenes, salmonella spp., and staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == this study aimed to characterize the microbiological quality and safety of raw milk and soft cheese, verifying possible associations between microbial populations, and the detection of lactic acid bacteria (lab) with antagonistic activity against foodborne pathogens. raw milk (n = 36) and soft cheese (n = 18)  samples were collected and submitted for the analysis of mesophilic aerobes, total coliforms, escherichia coli, lab, coagulase-positive staphylococcus (cps),  listeria monocytogenes, and salmonella spp. in all, 389 lab isolates were randomly selected and submitted for antagonistic tests against l. monocytogenes,  st. aureus, salmonella typhimurium, and lactobacillus sakei. the samples presented high counts of mesophilic aerobes, total coliforms, and lab, and also high and significant correlation indices between these populations. low levels of cps and e. coli were observed, as well as an absence of salmonella spp. and l. monocytogenes. a substantial portion of the analyzed samples presented lab cultures with antagonistic activity, but not against salmonella typhimurium. the  obtained results indicate the antimicrobial potential of the autochthonous microbiota of raw milk and soft cheese. despite the spoilage potential, the lab present in the studied food products can be isolated and properly characterized as antagonistic cultures, to be used in bioconservation studies for pathogen control in foods.

TI  == inhibition of uropathogens by lactic acid bacteria isolated from dairy foods and  cow's intestine in western nigeria.
AB  == a total of 96 lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from african indigenous fermented products and cow's intestines to study their inhibitory capability against multi-drug-resistant uropathogens. escherichia coli accounted for approximately 45% of isolated uropathogens, followed by staphylococcus spp. (20%). the gram negative uropathogens were highly resistant to quinolones, co-trimoxazole, teicoplanin and some beta-lactams, while the staphylococcus spp.  showed high resistance to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams and macrolides. twenty-four lab isolates were selected based on their antimicrobial activity against two uropathogenic staphylococcus aureus strains and bacteriocin production. lab strains showing antimicrobial activity were grouped into smaller  groups through amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra). representative strains were identified as weissella spp., enterococcus faecium, lactococcus lactis and lactobacillus brevis through sequencing of 16s rdna. the weissella spp. and l. brevis strains demonstrated remarkable inhibitory activity  against seven strains of gram negative uropathogens. two strains of l. lactis produced a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance active against lactobacillus sakei. in this study, an unusual high rate of co-trimoxazole, quinolones and macrolides resistance among uropathogens from south west nigeria was discovered.  based on their sensitivity to weissella spp., there is a potential for using these lab as a natural approach for the protection against the uropathogens assayed.

TI  == effect of industrial and natural biocides on spoilage, pathogenic and technological strains grown in biofilm.
AB  == this study aimed at investigating bactericide solutions effective on spoilage and pathogenic bacteria while preserving technological bacteria. two compounds of essential oil (thymol and eugenol), one essential oil of satureja thymbra and two industrial biocides (pe 270-30, brillo) were tested on technological strains (staphylococcus equorum, staphylococcus succinus and lactobacillus sakei) grown in monoculture biofilm and on a mixed biofilm of pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes) and spoilage bacteria (pseudomonas fragi, escherichia coli). biofilm cultures were performed in glass fibre filters for 24h at 20 degrees c before application of biocides. thymol and  eugenol had no effect on the mixed biofilm. s. thymbra (2%) was highly effective  on spoilage strains (5 log reduction), and s. equorum (4 log reduction) was moderately effective on pathogens (2.3 log reduction) and not effective on s. succinus and l. sakei (0.5 log reduction). pe-270-30 with 10% na((2))so((4)) decreased spoilage bacteria (5.1 log reduction), maintained the technological bacteria, but did not reduce the pathogens. the disinfectant brillo (3%) killed all the strains. these results showed the difficulty in obtaining a biocide that  is effective in destroying spoilage and pathogenic bacteria while preserving technological bacteria. essential oils could be a good alternative for eradicating spoilage bacteria in the food environment where they are often found  at high levels.

TI  == characterisation of naturally fermented sausages produced in the north east of italy.
AB  == in the friuli venezia giulia region, in the north east of italy, a traditional fermented sausage is produced without the use of microbial starters. it is characterized at the end of the ripening period by accentuated acidity, slight sourness and elastic, semi-hard consistency. in this study, three fermentations,  carried out in different seasons (winter, spring and summer) were followed analyzing the microbiological, physicochemical and sensory aspects of this product. the sausages were characterized by an important microbial activity of lactic acid bacteria and micro/staphylococci that resulted in a product with a final ph of about 5.6-5.7. an interesting aspect was the high number of fecal enterococci that can play an important role in the definition of the organoleptic profile of the final product. no listeria monocytogenes, salmonella spp. and staphylococcus aureus were ever isolated from the raw materials or the fermented  sausages during the maturation, underlining the safety of this product. the final water activity of the product was 0.91-0.92. one hundred and fifty lactic acid bacteria were isolated and identified by molecular methods to understand which species were more predominant in the product. lactobacillus curvatus and lactobacillus sakei were the most numerous (54 and 64 strains isolated, respectively) and they were the only species common to all three fermentations. a cluster analysis of the profiles obtained from these strains after rapd-pcr highlighted a population distribution that was fermentation-specific.

TI  == screening of lactic-acid bacteria from south african barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  == strains of lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain st11br), l. pentosus  (strain st151br), l. plantarum (strain st13br), and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain st34br) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the western, northern and eastern provinces of south africa. the peptides (bacst11br, bacst151br, bacst13br and bacst34br) lost their  activity after treatment with proteinase k, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. the peptides inhibited the growth of lactobacillus casei, l. sakei, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis, but not enterobacter cloacae, lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, l. plantarum, l. salivarius, listeria innocua, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus uberis, s. agalactiae, s. caprinus and s. pneumoniae. peptides bacst11br and bacst13br differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the e. coli strains. peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at ph 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees c. when autoclaved (121 degrees c, 20 min), only bacst13br lost its activity. the bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees c,  but not at 37 degrees c.

TI  == antimicrobial potential of immobilized lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis atcc 11454 against selected bacteria.
AB  == immobilization of living cells of lactic acid bacteria could be an alternative or complementary method of immobilizing organic acids and bacteriocins and inhibit undesirable bacteria in foods. this study evaluated the inhibition potential of immobilized lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis atcc 11454 on selected bacteria by a modified method of the agar spot test. l. lactis was immobilized in calcium alginate (1 to 2%)-whey protein concentrate (0 and 1%) beads. the antimicrobial potential of immobilized l. lactis was evaluated in microbiological media against pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli, salmonella, and staphylococcus aureus) or  pseudomonas putida, a natural meat contaminant, and against seven gram-positive bacteria used as indicator strains. results obtained in this study indicated that immobilized l. lactis inhibited the growth of s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus curvatus, lactobacillus sakei, kocuria varians, and pediococcus acidilactici. only 4 h of incubation at 35 degrees c resulted in a clear inhibition zone around the beads that increased with time. with the addition of 10 mm of a chelating agent (edta) to the media, results showed growth inhibition of e. coli; however, p. putida and salmonella typhi were unaffected by this treatment. these results indicate that immobilized lactic acid bacteria strains can be successfully used to produce nisin and inhibit bacterial  growth in semisolid synthetic media.

TI  == characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from a greek dry-fermented sausage in respect of their technological and probiotic properties.
AB  == a total of 147 lactic acid bacteria was isolated from two types of naturally fermented dry sausages at four different stages of the ripening process studied in order to select the most suitable strains according to their technological characteristics including probiotic properties and antimicrobial activity against food-borne pathogens. identification of the isolates revealed that 90% were lactobacilli, 4% enterococci, 3% pediococcus sp. and sporadic isolates of weissella viridescens, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, and leuconostoc sp. the isolated strains of lactobacillus sakei (49 isolates), lactobacillus curvatus (24 isolates) and lactobacillus plantarum (7 isolates) were further characterized. all strains could grow at 15 degrees c, whereas the majority of the strains was able to grow in the presence of 6.5% nacl and on acetate agar. the enzymatic potential of the strains was evaluated using the api zym system. during in vitro  investigations all strains exhibited high leucine and valine aminopeptidase activities and moderate acid phosphatase and phosphohydrolase activities. some strains showed very weak lipolytic activity. the enzyme profiling is an important factor for selection of strains as starter cultures. a large majority of the strains tolerated 0.1% bile salts whereas 58% of lactobacillus curvatus strains and all lactobacillus plantarum strains were resistant to 0.3% bile salts. all lactobacillus sakei strains and the majority of lactobacillus curvatus and lactobacillus plantarum strains exhibited an anti-listerial activity against three listeria monocytogenes strains. a percentage of 75, 50 and 29% of lactobacillus sakei, l. curvatus and l. plantarum strains, respectively, could inhibit two staphylococcus aureus strains. the contribution of the selected strains to a possible inhibition of listeria monocytogenes and s. aureus in situ  on fermented meats would be of considerable interest to enhance the hygienic quality of these products.

TI  == molecular characterization of tet(m) genes in lactobacillus isolates from different types of fermented dry sausage.
AB  == the likelihood that products prepared from raw meat and milk may act as vehicles  for antibiotic-resistant bacteria is currently of great concern in food safety issues. in this study, a collection of 94 tetracycline-resistant (tc(r)) lactic acid bacteria recovered from nine different fermented dry sausage types were subjected to a polyphasic molecular study with the aim of characterizing the host organisms and the tet genes, conferring tetracycline resistance, that they carry. with the (gtg)(5)-pcr dna fingerprinting technique, the tc(r) lactic acid bacterial isolates were identified as lactobacillus plantarum, l. sakei subsp. carnosus, l. sakei subsp. sakei, l. curvatus, and l. alimentarius and typed to the intraspecies level. for a selection of 24 tc(r) lactic acid bacterial isolates displaying unique (gtg)(5)-pcr fingerprints, tet genes were determined by means of pcr, and only tet(m) was detected. restriction enzyme analysis with acci and scai revealed two different tet(m) allele types. this grouping was confirmed by partial sequencing of the tet(m) open reading frame, which indicated that the two allele types displayed high sequence similarities (>99.6%) with tet(m) genes previously reported in staphylococcus aureus mrsa 101 and in neisseria meningitidis, respectively. southern hybridization with plasmid profiles revealed that the isolates contained tet(m)-carrying plasmids. in addition to the tet(m) gene, one isolate also contained an erm(b) gene on a different plasmid from the one encoding the tetracycline resistance. furthermore, it was also shown by pcr that the tet(m) genes were not located on transposons of the tn916/tn1545 family. to our knowledge, this is the first detailed molecular study demonstrating that taxonomically and genotypically diverse lactobacillus strains from different types of fermented meat products can be a host for plasmid-borne tet genes.

TI  == bacteriocin production by spray-dried lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == aims: cell survival and antagonistic activity against listeria innocua, listeria  monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus were investigated after spray-drying three bacteriocin-producing strains of lactic acid bacteria: carnobacterium divergens, lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus sakei. methods and results: bacterial cell concentrates were spray-dried and stored at 4 degrees c and 18 degrees c and 0.3% erh (equilibrium relative humidity). enumeration and antagonistic activity were evaluated before and after spray-drying and at regular intervals during storage. conclusions: a higher survival rate was obtained when survival was performed at 4 degrees c. with the exception of carnobacterium divergens which lost the inhibitory activity against staph. aureus after drying,  antagonistic production was not affected by the process nor by the storage. of the three species studied, lact. salivarius showed the highest resistance to the  spray-drying and storage processes. significance and impact of the study: spray-drying is a potentially useful process for large scale production of dried  powders containing viable organisms with antagonistic activity against pathogens.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of gram-positive bacteria based on grpe, encoded by the dnak operon.
AB  == the dnak operon in gram-positive bacteria includes grpe, dnaj and, in some members, hrca as well. both dnak and dnaj have been utilized for constructing phylogenetic relationships among various organisms. multiple copies exist for dnak and dnaj genes in some bacterial genera, as opposed to a single gene copy for grpe and for hrca, according to the currently available data. here, we present a partial protein-based phylogenetic tree for gram-positive bacteria, derived by using the amino acid sequence identity of grpe; the results are compared with the phylogenetic trees generated from 5s rrna, 16s rrna, dnak and dnaj sequences. our results indicate three main groupings: two are within low-g+c dna gram-positive bacteria comprising bacillus species and staphylococcus aureus  on the one hand and streptococcus species/lactococcus lactis/enterococcus faecalis/lactobacillus sakei on the other hand; the mycobacterium species and streptomyces coelicolor, belonging to the high-g+c dna gram-positive bacteria, form the third cluster. this hierarchical arrangement is in close agreement with  that obtained with 16s rrna and dnak sequences but not dnaj-based phylogeny.
