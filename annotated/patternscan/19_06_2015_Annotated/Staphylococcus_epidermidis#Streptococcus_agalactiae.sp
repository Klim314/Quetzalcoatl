TI  == a c-type lectin from bothrops jararacussu venom disrupts staphylococcal biofilms.
AB  == bovine mastitis is a major threat to animal health and the dairy industry. staphylococcus aureus is a contagious pathogen that is usually associated with persistent intramammary infections, and biofilm formation is a relevant aspect of the outcome of these infections. several biological activities have been described for snake venoms, which led us to screen secretions of bothrops jararacussu for antibiofilm activity against s. aureus nrs155. crude venom was fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography, and the fractions were tested against s. aureus. biofilm growth, but not bacterial growth, was affected by several fractions. two fractions (15 and 16) showed the best activities and were  also assayed against s. epidermidis nrs101. fraction 15 was identified by tripletof mass spectrometry as a galactose-binding c-type lectin with a molecular weight of 15 kda. the lectin was purified from the crude venom by d-galactose affinity chromatography, and only one peak was observed. this pure lectin was able to inhibit 75% and 80% of s. aureus and s. epidermidis biofilms, respectively, without affecting bacterial cell viability. the lectin also exhibited a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on both bacterial biofilms. the antibiofilm activity was confirmed using scanning electron microscopy. a pre-formed s. epidermidis biofilm was significantly disrupted by the c-type lectin in a time-dependent manner. additionally, the lectin demonstrated the ability to inhibit biofilm formation by several mastitis pathogens, including different field strains of s. aureus, s. hyicus, s. chromogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and escherichia coli. these findings reveal a new activity for c-type lectins. studies are underway to evaluate the biological activity of these lectins in a mouse mastitis model.

TI  == microbiology of pelvic lymphocyst infection after lymphadenectomy for malignant gynecologic tumors.
AB  == background: pelvic lymphocyst infection is a rare complication after lymphadenectomy for malignant gynecologic tumors. although medical therapy is a useful addition to surgical drainage, the appropriate antibiotic regimen is unknown because few studies have examined the causative organisms. the purpose of this case series was to identify the micro-organisms infecting pelvic lymphocysts. methods: this was a single-center, retrospective, case-series review conducted at a tertiary-care cancer center between october 2002 and march 2013. the participants included all patients who experienced their first pelvic lymphocyst infection after undergoing pelvic lymphadenectomy for cervical, endometrial, or ovarian cancer and exhibited positive lymphocyst fluid culture. computed tomography- or sonography-guided percutaneous aspiration procedures were performed to obtain lymphocyst fluid for culture. results: during the study period, 878 patients underwent lymphadenectomy for gynecologic malignant tumors,  and 13 developed a pelvic lymphocyst infection documented microbiologically. cultures identified staphylococcus aureus (three patients), s. epidermidis (one patient), streptococcus agalactiae (three patients), enterococcus (two patients), escherichia coli (one patient), and anaerobic bacteria (three patients). they were all monomicrobial infections. conclusions: our study and other smaller ones  suggest that lymphocyst infections following pelvic lymphadenectomy for malignant gynecologic tumors usually are monomicrobial and caused by gram-positive cocci, including staphylococcus, streptococcus, and enterococcus, and anaerobes such as  bacteroides fragilis. these bacteria should be considered when selecting empiric  antibiotic therapy.

TI  == antimicrobial protein and peptide concentrations and activity in human breast milk consumed by preterm infants at risk of late-onset neonatal sepsis.
AB  == objective: we investigated the levels and antimicrobial activity of antimicrobial proteins and peptides (amps) in breast milk consumed by preterm infants, and whether deficiencies of these factors were associated with late-onset neonatal sepsis (los), a bacterial infection that frequently occurs in preterm infants in  the neonatal period. study design: breast milk from mothers of preterm infants (</= 32 weeks gestation) was collected on days 7 (n = 88) and 21 (n = 77) postpartum. concentrations of lactoferrin, ll-37, beta-defensins 1 and 2, and alpha-defensin 5 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the antimicrobial activity of breast milk samples against staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and streptococcus agalactiae was compared to the activity of infant formula, alone or supplemented with physiological levels of amps. samples of breast milk fed to infants with and without subsequent los were compared for levels of amps and inhibition of bacterial growth. results: levels of most amps and antibacterial activity in preterm breast milk were higher at day 7 than at day 21. lactoferrin was the only amp that limited pathogen growth >50% when added to formula at a concentration equivalent to that present in breast milk. levels of amps were similar in the breast milk fed to infants with and without los, however, infants who developed los consumed significantly less breast milk and lower doses of milk amps than those who were free from los. conclusions: the concentrations of lactoferrin and  defensins in preterm breast milk have antimicrobial activity against common neonatal pathogens.

TI  == chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils of pinus peuce (pinaceae) growing wild in r. macedonia.
AB  == the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils isolated from twigs with needles (t+n) and from twigs without needles (t-n) from  wild pinus peuce griseb. (pinaceae), from three different locations in r. macedonia, were investigated. essential oil yields of t+n ranged from 7.5 ml/kg to 12.5 ml/kg and for t-n from 13.8 ml/kg to 17.3 ml/kg. gc/fid/ms analysis of the essential oils revealed eighty-four components, representing 93.7-95.7% and 91.2-92.0% of the t+n and t-n oils, respectively. the major components in t+n and t-n oils were monoterpenes: alpha-pinene (23.8-39.9%, 21.2-23.3%), camphene (2.2-5.5%, 0.7-2.0%), beta-pinene (10.1-17.1%, 8.2-16.4%), myrcene (1.2-1.41%, 1.6-2.5%), limonene+beta-phellandrene (6.8-14.0%, 8.8-23.6%) and bornyl acetate (2.3-6.9%, 1.1-3.4%), followed by the sesquiterpenes: trans-(e)-caryophyllene (3.6-4.3%, 3.2-7.3%), germacrene d (7.1-9.5%, 5.0-10.3%) and delta-cadinene (2.1-3.1%, 3.3-4.2%, respectively). antimicrobial screening of the essential oils was made by disk diffusion and broth dilution methods against 13 bacterial isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and one strain of candida albicans. t-n essential oils showed antimicrobial activity toward streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis and candida albicans as well as streptococcus agalactiae, acinetobacter spp. and haemophilus influenzae. the antimicrobial activity of t+n essential oils was greater, especially against streptococcus agalactiae, s. pyogenes, enterococcus and candida albicans, followed by haemophilus influenzae, acinetobacter spp., escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of all tested essential oils ranged from 15-125  mul/ml. summarizing the obtained results, the antimicrobial activity of pinus peuce t+n and t-n essential oils collected from different localities in r. macedonia varied considerably. these alterations in the antimicrobial activity can be attributed to the differences in the quantitative composition and percentage amounts of the components present in the respective essential oils, although it was evident that there were no differences in the qualitative composition of the essential oils, regardless of the locality of collection, or the type of plant material (t+n or t-n).

TI  == reduction of teat skin mastitis pathogen loads: differences between strains, dips, and contact times.
AB  == the purpose of these experiments was to (1) assess differences in mastitis pathogen strain sensitivities to teat disinfectants (teat dips), and (2) determine the optimum time for premilking teat dips to remain in contact with teat skin to reduce pathogen loads on teat skin. two experiments were conducted using the excised teat model. in experiment 1, the differences in mastitis pathogen strain sensitivities to 4 commercially available dips (dip a: 1% h2o2; dip b: 1% chlorine dioxide; dip c: 1% iodophor; and dip d: 0.5% iodophor) were evaluated. four strains of 11 common mastitis pathogens (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, mycoplasma bovis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus chromogenes, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus hyicus, staphylococcus xylosus, and staphylococcus haemolyticus) were tested. in experiment 2, the percentage log reduction of mastitis pathogens (escherichia coli, streptococcus uberis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, klebsiella species, staphylococcus chromogenes, staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus xylosus, and staphylococcus epidermidis) on teat skin with 3 commercially available teat dips: dip a; dip d;  and dip e: 0.25% iodophor, using dip contact times of 15, 30, and 45 s, was evaluated. experiment 1 results indicated significant differences in strain sensitivities to dips within pathogen species: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus chromogenes, and streptococcus uberis. species differences were also found where mycoplasma bovis (97.9% log reduction) was the most sensitive to tested teat dips and staphylococcus haemolyticus (71.4% log reduction) the most resistant. experiment 2 results indicated that contact times of 30 and 45 s were  equally effective in reducing recovered bacteria for dips d and e and were also significantly more effective than a 15-s contact time. no differences were seen in recovered bacteria between tested contact times after treatment with dip a. it can be concluded that different mastitis pathogen species and strains within species may possess different sensitivities to teat dips, which may have implications in selection of teat dips on dairies. furthermore, a 30-s premilking dip contact time for iodophors and 15 s for h2o2 dips may be optimal in reducing  pathogen load in the shortest amount of time. a reduction in premilking teat dip  contact time may improve milking parlor efficiency.

TI  == antibacterial compounds from salvia adenophora fernald (lamiaceae).
AB  == from the aerial parts of salvia adenophora fernald four derivatives of 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (1-4) together with five clerodane diterpenoids (5, 6, 8-10), and one known diterpene (7) have been isolated. compounds 1-6 and 8-10 are described for the first time. the structures were established by extensive 1d, 2d nmr and hresi-tofms spectroscopic methods. finally, the absolute configuration has been established by comparing of experimental and quantum chemical calculation of ecd spectra. despite a total lack of antimicrobial activity of the plant extract, hinting to the existence of antagonistic interactions in the crude material, three oxylipins (2-4) displayed a promising inhibition on gram-positive multidrug-resistant clinical strains including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae and, particularly, staphylococcus epidermidis, while the compounds 9 and 10 revealed a specific and strain-dependent activity against s. epidermidis. interestingly, the inhibition provided by these compounds was independent of the resistance patterns of these pathogens to classic antibiotics. no action was reported on gram-negative strains nor on candida albicans. these results confirm that clerodanes and, particularly, prostaglandin-like compounds can be considered as interesting antimicrobial agents deserving further study.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of azd0914, a new spiropyrimidinetrione dna gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent activity against gram-positive, fastidious gram-negative, and atypical bacteria.
AB  == azd0914 is a new spiropyrimidinetrione bacterial dna gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent in vitro antibacterial activity against key gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus agalactiae), fastidious gram-negative (haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae), atypical (legionella pneumophila), and anaerobic (clostridium difficile) bacterial species, including  isolates with known resistance to fluoroquinolones. azd0914 works via inhibition  of dna biosynthesis and accumulation of double-strand cleavages; this mechanism of inhibition differs from those of other marketed antibacterial compounds. azd0914 stabilizes and arrests the cleaved covalent complex of gyrase with double-strand broken dna under permissive conditions and thus blocks religation of the double-strand cleaved dna to form fused circular dna. whereas this mechanism is similar to that seen with fluoroquinolones, it is mechanistically distinct. azd0914 exhibited low frequencies of spontaneous resistance in s. aureus, and if mutants were obtained, the mutations mapped to gyrb. additionally, no cross-resistance was observed for azd0914 against recent bacterial clinical isolates demonstrating resistance to fluoroquinolones or other drug classes, including macrolides, beta-lactams, glycopeptides, and oxazolidinones. azd0914 was bactericidal in both minimum bactericidal concentration and in vitro time-kill studies. in in vitro checkerboard/synergy testing with 17 comparator antibacterials, only additivity/indifference was observed. the potent in vitro antibacterial activity (including activity against fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates), low frequency of resistance, lack of cross-resistance, and bactericidal activity of azd0914 support its continued development.

TI  == comparative study of bacteriological culture and real-time fluorescence quantitative pcr (rt-pcr) and multiplex pcr-based reverse line blot (mpcr/rlb) hybridization assay in the diagnosis of bacterial neonatal meningitis.
AB  == background: bacterial meningitis is more common in the neonatal period than any other time in life; however, it is still a challenge for the evidence based diagnosis. strategy for identification of neonatal bacterial meningitis pathogens is presented by evaluating three different available methods to establish evidence-based diagnosis for neonatal bacterial meningitis. methods: the cerebrospinal fluid samples from 56 neonates diagnosed as bacterial meningitis in 2009 in beijing children's hospital were analyzed in the study. two pcr based molecular assays, real-time fluorescence quantitative pcr (rt-pcr) and multiplex  pcr based-reverse line blot hybridization (mpcr/rlb), were used to assess 7 common neonatal meningitis bacterial pathongens, including escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, listerisa monocytogenes, neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus agalactiae. the findings in examinations of two assays were compared with the results obtained bacterial culture tests. results: bacterial meningitis was identified in five cases (9%) by csf cultures, 25 (45%) by rt-pcr and 16 (29%) by mpcr/rlb. one strain of s. epidermidis and one of e. faecalis were identified using mpcr/rlb but not by rt-pcr. in contrast, cultures identified one strain of s. pneumoniae which was missed by both pcr assays. overall, the bacterial pathogens in 28 cases were identified with these three methods. both rt-pcr and mpcr/rlb assays were more sensitive than bacterial culture, (p < 0.05). conclusion: our study confirmed that both rt-pcr and mpcr/rlb assays have better sensitivity than bacterial culture. they are capable of detecting the pathogens in csf samples with negative culture results.

TI  == synthesis and biological activities of novel pleuromutilin derivatives with a substituted thiadiazole moiety as potent drug-resistant bacteria inhibitors.
AB  == a series of novel pleuromutilin derivatives possessing thiadiazole moieties were  synthesized via acylation reactions under mild conditions. the in vitro antibacterial activities of the derivatives against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, and streptococcus agalactiae were tested by the agar dilution method and oxford cup assay. the majority of the tested compounds displayed moderate antibacterial activities. importantly, the three compounds with amino or tertiary amine groups in their side chains, 11, 13b, and 15c, were the most active antibacterial agents. docking experiments carried out on the peptidyl transferase center (ptc) of 23s rrna proved that there is a reasonable direct correlation between the binding free energy (deltagb, kcal/mol) and the antibacterial activity. moreover, the pharmacokinetic profiles of 11 and 15c in rat were characterized by moderate clearance and oral bioavailability.

TI  == new non-alcoholic formulation for hand disinfection.
AB  == hand washing is considered as the single most important strategy to prevent infections. world health organization (who) defines hand hygiene as a primary issue of personal care with particular reference to hospital personnel and health facility workers. in this work, we investigated a new combination for hand disinfection as an alternative to alcohol-based and chlorhexidine products. the new combination of 5-pyrrolidone-2-carboxylic acid (pca) and copper sulphate pentahydrate (cs) was tested upon different bacterial species that normally colonize hands, including staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus  (mr s. aureus), staphylococcus epidermidis, multidrug resistant s. epidermidis (mdr s. epidermidis), streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, candida albicans and three clinical isolates: mr s. aureus, mdr s. epidermidis, and an e. coli strain. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics),  minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs), fractional inhibitory concentration (fic) indices, and fractional bactericidal concentration (fbc) indices were evaluated. ethanol 70% v/v, isopropanol 60% v/v, and 4% w/v chlorhexidine solution were used as reference hand disinfectants. copper sulphate pentahydrate  was very effective against all tested microorganisms: the mic and mbc for cs ranged from 781 mg/l against s. pyogenes to 12500 mg/l against e. coli strains and c. albicans. in addition, pca exhibited a good antimicrobial activity, in particular, against s. pyogenes and s. agalactiae. the combination of cs and pca  showed a strong synergistic effect and all fic indices were </=0.500. the combination of cs and pca were more effective than ethanol 70% v/v and isopropanol 60% v/v. in addition to antimicrobial activity, the new formulation possesses peculiar features such as residual activity and moisturizing effect. this work identifies a new strategy for hand disinfection.

TI  == rapid detection of gram-positive organisms by use of the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test and the bact/alert pediatric fan system in a multicenter pediatric evaluation.
AB  == assays that expedite the reporting of organism identification and antibiotic susceptibility status in positive blood cultures can fast track interventions that improve clinical outcomes. we evaluated the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test (bc-gp) in two pediatric hospitals. positive bact/alert pediatric fan blood cultures with gram-positive organisms were tested using the bc-gp in tandem with routine laboratory procedures. to test organisms underrepresented in the clinical blood culture evaluation, blood culture bottles  were spiked with diluted organism suspensions at concentrations of 10 to 100 cfu  per milliliter. a total of 249 gram-positive bacterial isolates were recovered from 242 blood cultures. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, and methicillin-resistant s. aureus with sensitivities of 100%, 99%, and 100% and specificities of 100%, 100%, and 99.5%,  respectively. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible s. epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis  with sensitivities of 95%, 80%, and 96%, respectively, and 100% specificity. the  bc-gp correctly identified 14/15 cases of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus  faecium bacteremia and 9 cases of streptococcus pneumoniae. it misidentified 5/15 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis and 1/3 blood cultures spiked with streptococcus anginosus group as s. pneumoniae. the bc-gp detected a case of streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia but failed to detect 2/3 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus agalactiae. bc-gp's rapid accurate detection of staphylococcus spp., e. faecium, and e. faecalis and its ability to  ascertain meca, vana, and vanb status may expedite clinical decisions pertaining  to optimal antibiotic use. false-positive s. pneumoniae results may warrant reporting of only "streptococcus spp." when this organism is reported by the bc-gp.

TI  == novel bacteriophage lysin with broad lytic activity protects against mixed infection by streptococcus pyogenes and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus [gras]) cause serious and sometimes fatal human diseases.  they are among the many gram-positive pathogens for which resistance to leading antibiotics has emerged. as a result, alternative therapies need to be developed  to combat these pathogens. we have identified a novel bacteriophage lysin (plyss2), derived from a streptococcus suis phage, with broad lytic activity against mrsa, vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus (visa), streptococcus suis, listeria, staphylococcus simulans, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus equi, streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus [gbs]), s. pyogenes, streptococcus sanguinis, group g streptococci (ggs), group e streptococci (ges),  and streptococcus pneumoniae. plyss2 has an n-terminal cysteine-histidine aminopeptidase (chap) catalytic domain and a c-terminal sh3b binding domain. it is stable at 50 degrees c for 30 min, 37 degrees c for >24 h, 4 degrees c for 15  days, and -80 degrees c for >7 months; it maintained full activity after 10 freeze-thaw cycles. plyss2 at 128 mug/ml in vitro reduced mrsa and s. pyogenes growth by 5 logs and 3 logs within 1 h, respectively, and exhibited a mic of 16 mug/ml for mrsa. a single, 2-mg dose of plyss2 protected 92% (22/24) of the mice  in a bacteremia model of mixed mrsa and s. pyogenes infection. serially increasing exposure of mrsa and s. pyogenes to plyss2 or mupirocin resulted in no observed resistance to plyss2 and resistance to mupirocin. to date, no other lysin has shown such notable broad lytic activity, stability, and efficacy against multiple, leading, human bacterial pathogens; as such, plyss2 has all the characteristics to be an effective therapeutic.

TI  == proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  == background: a major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. the objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. method: bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an elisa plate reader and zymography. results: we identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. of these, six were gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium, and streptococcus bovis) and seven were gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis,  morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and serratia marcescens) organisms. two of these, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, are recognized  wound pathogens. conclusions: multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.

TI  == activity of oritavancin against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and beta-haemolytic streptococci collected from  western european countries in 2011.
AB  == objectives: to determine the activity of oritavancin against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and beta-haemolytic streptococci recently isolated from acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections or bacteraemia in western europe. methods: forty-one centres in spain (8), italy (9), germany (8), france (8) and the uk (8) submitted 866 isolates [204 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), 177 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (mrcons), 101 vre, 193 streptococcus agalactiae and 191 streptococcus pyogenes] that were collected during the first 6 months of 2011. these were re-identified and susceptibilities  to oritavancin and comparators were determined. results: oritavancin was very active against mrsa (mic(50)/mic(90) 0.03/0.06 mg/l), mrcons (0.06/0.12 mg/l), vre (0.03/0.06 mg/l), s. agalactiae (0.03/0.06 mg/l) and s. pyogenes (0.06/0.25 mg/l). the highest oritavancin mic observed was 0.25 mg/l (species were s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus hominis, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis). conclusions: these data from recently collected gram-positive bacteria in western europe confirm the potent in vitro activity of oritavancin against a wide range of resistant mrsa, mrcons and vre isolates, including ones resistant to newer agents.

TI  == protection against staphylococcus aureus by antibody to the polyglycerolphosphate backbone of heterologous lipoteichoic acid.
AB  == type 1 lipoteichoic acid (lta) is present in many clinically important gram-positive bacteria, including enterococci, streptococci, and staphylococci, and antibodies against lta have been shown to opsonize nonencapsulated enterococcus faecalis strains. in the present study, we show that antibodies against e. faecalis lta also bind to type 1 lta from other gram-positive species  and opsonized staphylocccus epidermidis and staphylcoccus aureus strains as well  as group b streptococci. inhibition studies using teichoic acid oligomers indicated that cross-reactive opsonic antibodies bind to the teichoic acid backbone. passive immunization with rabbit antibodies against e. faecalis lta promoted the clearance of bacteremia by e. faecalis and s. epidermidis in mice. furthermore, passive protection also reduced mortality in a murine s. aureus peritonitis model. the effectiveness of rabbit antibody against lta suggests that this conserved bacterial structure could function as a single vaccine antigen that targets multiple gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == identification of conserved antigens from staphylococcal and streptococcal pathogens.
AB  == the design of vaccines containing epitopes shared between different human pathogens may lead to cross-species protection. in order to identify potentially  conserved bacterial antigens, bacteriophage expression libraries of genomic dna from streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes were probed with human sera from staphylococcus aureus-infected and healthy individuals. by comparison with previous screening data from staphylococcus epidermidis and staph. aureus, putative antigenic, conserved domains across the genera were identified. in particular, three potentially antigenic conserved regions were identified based on the n-terminal domain of sacol0609 (sdrd), the c-terminal domain of sacol0723 (scab) and the c-terminus of sacol1140 (isda) from staph. aureus. the three domains were overexpressed, recombinant proteins were purified and polyclonal antisera raised against them recognized cell surface-located proteins from both staphylococcal and streptococcal species. the antisera were also able to opsonize both staph. aureus and strep. agalactiae thereby increasing their phagocytic uptake by human neutrophils. the conserved antigenic domains therefore represent potential cross-protective vaccine candidates.

TI  == serotypes and antibiotic resistance in group b streptococcus isolated from patients at the maternity hospital, kuwait.
AB  == a total of 143 group b streptococcus (gbs) isolates collected from mothers at the maternity hospital in kuwait were investigated for their serotypes and antibiotic resistance, and screened by pcr for the carriage of genes for resistance to tetracycline (tetk, tetm, tetl, teto), erythromycin (erma, ermb, ermc, ermtr, ermm, mefa, mefe, msra) and aminoglycosides (aph3, ant4, ant6). all isolates were serotyped using a latex agglutination test. most of the isolates belonged to serotypes v (38.5 %), iii (20.9 %), ia (7.7 %) and ii (11.2 %). sixteen isolates  (11.2 %) were nontypable. all isolates were susceptible to penicillin, ampicillin and cefotaxime (mics 0.016-0.094 microg ml(-1)) but were resistant to trimethoprim (92.3 %), tetracycline (89.5 %), minocycline (89.5 %), high-level kanamycin (76.9 %), chloramphenicol (30.0 %), erythromycin (12.6 %), clindamycin  (7.0 %), high-level streptomycin (3.5 %) and ciprofloxacin (0.7 %). the tetracycline-resistant isolates contained tetm (94.5 %), teto (3.9 %), tetl (1.6  %) and tetk (0.8 %). the erythromycin-resistant isolates contained ermb (61.1 %), ermtr (38.9 %), erma (5.5 %), mefa (5.5 %) and mefe (11 %). all high-level kanamycin-resistant isolates contained aph3. one of the high-level streptomycin-resistant isolates contained ant6. partial dna sequencing of aph3 revealed sequences with 99 % similarity to aph3 found in enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, suggesting that the gbs isolates could have acquired aph3 from other gram-positive cocci. the high proportion of isolates with resistance to tetracycline, high-level kanamycin and trimethoprim, and the increase in the prevalence of erythromycin resistance, represents an emerging public health concern that needs further surveillance.

TI  == [the characteristics of gram-positive bacteria isolated from skin lesions observed in ambulatory patients and the assessment of their susceptibility to antimicrobial drugs].
AB  == the bacterial skin and soft-tissue infections occur commonly and are characterized by more or less intensified changes within skin and subcutaneous tissue. the bacterial skin infections give rise to significant therapeutic problems associated with increasing resistance etiological agents of these infections to antibiotics and chemotherapeutics. the aim of this study was to assess the distribution of various gram-positive microorganisms in skin lesion observed in ambulatory patients in a period from june 2005 to december 2006. there were 116 bacterial strains isolated and identified from clinical samples: staphylococcus aureus, coagulase - negative staphylococi (s.epidermidis, s. xylosus, s.capitis, s.saccharolyticus), propionobacterium acnes, streptococcus spp. (s.agalactiae, s.pyogenes) i corynebacterium spp. (c. striatum, c. amycolatum, c. aquaticum). in the further part of this study we analyzed a profile of their susceptibility to antibiotics and chemotherapeutics in relation  to drugs recommended for the empirical therapy. the resultant resistance patterns among the examined bacterial isolates are indicative of certain divergence between recommended empirical antibiotic therapy and actual antimicrobial susceptibility of many etiologic factors of skin and soft-tissue infections.

TI  == evaluation antimicrobial and antiadhesive properties of the biosurfactant lunasan produced by candida sphaerica ucp 0995.
AB  == different groups of biosurfactants exhibit diverse properties and display a variety of physiological functions in producer microorganisms; these include enhancing the solubility of hydrophobic/water-insoluble compound, heave metal binding, bacterial pathogenesis, cell adhesion and aggregation, quorum sensing and biofilm formation. candida sphaerica was grown in a low cost medium, consisting of distilled water supplemented with 9% refinery residue of soybean oil and 9% corn steep liquor, for 144 h at 28 degrees c and 150 rpm. the cell-free supernatant obtained at the end of the experiments was submitted to extraction, and afterward the biosurfactant was isolated using methanol with a yield of 9 g l(-1). the critical micelle concentration of the biosurfactant was found to be 0.25 mg ml(-1) with a surface tension of 25 mn m(-1). several concentrations of the biosurfactant (0.625-10 mg ml(-1)) were used to evaluate its antimicrobial and antiadhesive activities against a variety of microorganisms. the biosurfactant showed antimicrobial activity against streptococcus oralis (68%), candida albicans (57%), and staphylococcus epidermidis(57.6%) for the highest concentration tested. furthermore, the biosurfactant at a concentration of 10 mg ml(-1) inhibited the adhesion between 80 and 92% of pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus sanguis12. inhibition of adhesion with percentages near 100% occurred for the higher concentrations of biosurfactant used. results gathered in this study point to a potential use of the biosurfactant in biomedical applications.

TI  == ozone in dentistry: microbiological effects of gas action depending on the method and the time of application using the ozonytron device. experimental study.
AB  == introduction: bactericidal, virucidal, and fungicidal activity of ozone is generally known and has been exploited for years in industry and medicine. ozone  therapy became an inherent element of the treatment of infection in such fields as surgery, dermatology, cosmetics, and dentistry. ozone is a gas, so it penetrates very well even into such tissues and spaces that are not easily accessible. thanks to the property of deep penetration and long ozone presence in tissues after treatment, a long-lasting bactericidal effect is achieved. the action of oxygen radicals is, however, not neutral for the human organism, therefore the use of an appropriate procedure and therapy algorithms is essential. material and methods: we decided to confirm the effect of antibacterial activity of ozone applied by means of the ozonytron device (made by biozonix) on model strains of streptococcus salivarius, pneumonia, pyogenes, and  agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, using two application patterns developed by us. results: we found a statistically significant difference in the size of zones of inhibited bacterial growth on all  media depending on the time of action of ozone. in the present paper, the bactericidal activity of ozone in relation to bacterial strains that are most frequently isolated from the oral cavity was confirmed. what is more, two models  of application of the gas on the infected medium were compared. conclusion: research on the use of ozone in combatting bacteria typical for dental diseases has shown that the gas has an oxidizing effect on these bacteria and is bactericidal.

TI  == mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  == the oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. when this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. the mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the streptococcus (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis) and staphylococcus (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis. in addition, some members of both the streptococcus and the staphylococcus genera, as well as porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. the current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. the pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.

AB  == the evaluation of tests for neonatal sepsis is important because the infection may present a very serious threat to the baby. extensive literature exists on single laboratory test or combinations of tests, as well as tests used together with risk factors and/or clinical signs, to diagnose neonatal sepsis. in many instances, the results of the evaluations have been conflicting. it has recently  been suggested that serum procalcitonin (pct) is of value: in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis, with varying results. this study was designed to determine the reliability of pct concentrations as a new marker for the diagnosis of early neonatal sepsis of vertical transmission comparing to the traditional inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-6 (il-6) and c-reactive protein (crp) values. the current study included 69 newborn babies. after full history and clinical examination, they were classified into 2 groups: group 1, included 27 of asymptomatic newborn infants admitted during the first 24 h of life to the neonatal unit because of prematurity, low birth weight. they had no clinical signs of sepsis during their first week of life and had a negative blood culture, and they did not receive antibiotic treatment. the second group: group 2, included 42 symptomatic neonates who were admitted to the neonatal care unit and  were evaluated for sepsis during the first 48 h of life, they were subclassified  into twosubgroups: group 2a; included 22 neonates of confirmed vertical neonatal  sepsis, defined as they had at least three clinical signs of infection with culture proven sepsis, and group 2b included 20 neonates of vertical clinical sepsis (they had at least three clinical signs of infection) with negative blood  culture. blood sampling for blood culture, complete blood count, blood gases and  blood chemistry, additionally, crp, serum il-6 and pct were measured. the microbial organisms isolated from the blood culture of group 2a; escherichia coli was isolated from 9 cases, staphylococcus aureus from 6 cases, staphylococcus epidermidis from 2 cases, group b streptococci (gbs) from 2 cases, ureaplasma from 2 cases and one case was gbs positive mother. the comparison between the studied groups revealed that, white blood cell counts (wbcs) and crp levels were  significantly increased in group 2a more than in group 1 and group 2b. while in group 2b the wbcs not differed from group 1 but crp differed from group 1. il-6 and pct values were significantly increased in group 2a more than in group 1 and  group 2b. furthermore in group 2b both were significantly increased as compared to group 1. for the diagnosis of neonatal infection, at cutoff >1.5 ng/ml, pct give a sensitivity of 92.9%, specificity of 85.2%, positive predictive value (ppv) of 84.8%, and negative predictive value (npv) of 76.7%. at a cutoff >140 ng/ml, il-6 gives a sensitivity of 76.2%, specificity of 70.4%, ppv of 64%, npv of 63.3%. however, at a cutoff >12 mg/l, crp gives a sensitivity of 88%, specificity of 77.8%, ppv of 77.1%, npv of 70%. we conclude that the serum pct concentration showed a good diagnostic value for the early detection of neonatal  sepsis of vertical transmission comparing with the other traditional markers of inflammations, thus may facilitate early therapeutic intervention in those high risk group.

TI  == levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines produced from cord blood in-vitro are pathogen dependent and increased in comparison to adult controls.
AB  == background: overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines may play a role in increased morbidity and mortality from neonatal sepsis. objective of this study was to compare secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by the cord blood cells of healthy term neonates to the venous blood cells of healthy adults in vitro after  stimulation with common neonatal pathogens. method: blood samples were cultured in the presence of heat-killed group b beta-hemolytic streptococci (gbs), escherichia coli (e. coli) and staphylococcus epidermidis (s. epi). concentrations of secreted cytokines (interleukine-6, il-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, tnf-alpha, interleukine-1 beta, il-1beta and interleukine-8, il-8)  were measured after 0, 1, 2 and 4 h of incubation using chemiluminescent immunometric automated assay. results: blood samples from 22 neonates and 16 adults were compared. after stimulation by gbs and e. coli, cord blood cells secreted significantly higher levels of il-6 and il-8 than blood cells of healthy adults. in cord blood, e. coli induced secretion of higher concentration of il-6, tnf-alpha, il-1beta and il-8 than s. epi, and more il-6 than gbs; gbs induced more il-1beta than s.epi. conclusions: response of cord blood to microbial activators is different from that of adult controls. each isolate of heat-killed  bacteria induced different amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines in vitro. this may represent a useful in vitro virulence test.

TI  == activity of staphylococcal bacteriocins against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae involved in bovine mastitis.
AB  == the inhibitory activity of seven bacteriocins produced by staphylococcus aureus (aureocins a70, a53, and 215fn) and staphylococcus epidermidis (pep5, epidermin,  epilancin k7 and epicidin 280) was tested against strains of both s. aureus (165  strains) and streptococcus agalactiae (74 strains) isolated from udders of cows suffering from bovine mastitis. most strains of the two species were inhibited by epidermin (>85%), aureocin a53 (>67%) and by a combination of aureocins a70 and a53 (>91%), co-expressed in the genetic background of strain a70, the native producer of aureocin a70. synergy between aureocins a70 and a53 was also demonstrated, which broadened the spectrum of strains inhibited. the remaining staphylococcins inhibited either none of, or a lower percentage (<48%) of, the mastitis-causing pathogens tested. our results therefore show that the use of epidermin and/or a combination of aureocins a53 and a70 may represent a new non-antibiotic alternative for successfully inhibiting both mastitic staphylococci and streptococci.

TI  == evaluation of the in vitro activity of tigecycline against multiresistant gram-positive cocci containing tetracycline resistance determinants.
AB  == this study was undertaken to test the in vitro activity of tigecycline against 117 clinically relevant gram-positive pathogens and to correlate this activity with their resistance gene content. overall, tigecycline showed a minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) range of 0.015-0.5mg/l, able to inhibit potently all multiresistant streptococci, enterococci and mr staphylococci. tigecycline was active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and enterococci, with mics for 90% of the organisms (mic(90)) of 0.25 mg/l and 0.12 mg/l, respectively, being more active than linezolid (mic(90)=2 mg/l) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (mic(90)=0.5 and 2-4 mg/l, respectively). molecular characterisation of resistance determinants demonstrated the concomitant presence of different classes of genes: in particular, tet(m), erm(b) and erm(c) in streptococcus agalactiae; tet(o), variably associated with different erm genes, in streptococcus pyogenes; vana, tet(m) and erm(b) in enterococcus faecalis, and  vana and erm(b) in enterococcus faecium. all the mrsa strains harboured sccmec and erm genes and 50% possessed tet(k) with tet(m) genes. staphylococcus epidermidis strains were only resistant to erythromycin. these results clearly demonstrate that tigecycline has a mic(90) range of 0.015-0.5 mg/l both against tetracycline-susceptible and -resistant isolates carrying other resistance determinants, suggesting that this drug could play an important role in the treatment of infections caused by these multiresistant gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == prevention of transfusion of platelet components contaminated with low levels of  bacteria: a comparison of bacteria culture and pathogen inactivation methods.
AB  == background: this study compared the efficacy of bacterial detection with inactivation for reducing the risk associated with transfusion of platelet (plt)  components contaminated with low levels of bacteria. study design and methods: twenty-one double-dose plts were spiked with seven species of bacteria at three levels (0.003-0.03, 0.03-0.3, 0.3-3 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml). after split, each plt unit contained 1 to 10, 10 to 100, and 100 to 1000 cfus. one unit was photochemically treated (pct; 150 micromol/l amotosalen and 3 j/cm(2) ultraviolet a). the other unit was untreated. all units were stored and sampled on days 1, 2, and 5 of storage for aerobic and anaerobic culture in the bact/alert system (biomerieux). plts were classified as sterile when no bacterial growth was detected after 120 hours of culture. results: in all pct plts, no bacteria were detected throughout 5 days of storage regardless of species, level of contamination, and sampling time. in untreated plts, staphylococcus aureus was consistently detected by culturing. growth of 1 to 10 cfus per unit staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 to 100 cfus per unit of klebsiella pneumoniae, and  1 to 1000 cfus per unit propionibacterium acnes was delayed and only detectable after 5, 2, and 5 days of storage, respectively. low levels of streptococcus agalactiae (1-10 cfus/unit), escherichia coli (1-100 cfus/unit), and clostridium  perfringens (1-100 cfus/unit) were not detected during 5 days of storage, although bacterial outgrowth was detected at higher levels of contamination. conclusions: for the seven bacterial species examined, contaminated plts may be released for transfusion on test-negative-to-date status. in contrast, bacterial  inactivation by pct could reduce the risk associated with transfusion of plts contaminated with low levels of these bacteria.

TI  == albomycin is an effective antibiotic, as exemplified with yersinia enterocolitica and streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == albomycin belongs to the class of sideromycins, compounds composed of iron carriers linked to antibiotic moieties. albomycin was found to be active against  bacteria that have a functional ferric hydroxamate transport system meaning that  bacteria will actively transport albomycin until they die. we examined the activity spectrum of albomycin for bacterial pathogens and found that enterobacteriaceae except species of proteus and morganella were sensitive. resistance in the two genera was due to the lack of the ferric hydroxamate transport system. among gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae were highly sensitive, whereas streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus epidermidis were resistant. the in vivo efficacy of albomycin was examined in mice infected with s. pneumoniae or yersinia enterocolitica. a single dose of 10mg albomycin/kg body weight reduced the colony-forming units of y. enterocolitica by three to four orders of magnitude. a single dose of 1mg albomycin/kg body weight was sufficient to clear  s. pneumoniae infections in mice. in direct competition experiments with wild-type s. pneumoniae and its albomycin-resistant mutant, the recovery rate of  the mutant was lower than for the wild-type indicating that the mutant had reduced fitness in the mouse model. we conclude that albomycin is effective in clearing infections caused by both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in a  mouse model. albomycin treatment reduces the bacterial load allowing the immune system to remove residual albomycin-resistant bacteria, and as such would make albomycin-based antibiotics an adjunct to treatment. the ferrichrome transport system serves as a trojan horse to get albomycin into bacteria.

TI  == multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16s rrna gene pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  == we have developed a novel high-throughput pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (pcr-ldr-ce) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, francisella tularensis, and brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. the method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16s rrna gene, using universal pcr primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent ldr. the ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by ce. each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to  distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. the assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. the ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the united states. in summary, the pcr-ldr-ce assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of  20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.

TI  == capillary isoelectric focusing of microorganisms in the ph range 2-5 in a dynamically modified fs capillary with uv detection.
AB  == the isoelectric points of many microbial cells lie within the ph range spanning from 1.5 to 4.5. in this work, we suggest a cief method for the separation of cells according to their isoelectric points in the ph range of 2-5. it includes the segmental injection of the sample pulse composed of the segment of the selected simple ampholytes, the segment of the bioanalytes and the segment of carrier ampholytes into fused silica capillaries dynamically modified by poly(ethylene glycole). this polymer dissolved in the catholyte, in the anolyte and in the injected sample pulse was used for a prevention of the bioanalyte adsorption on the capillary surface and for the reduction of the electroosmotic flow. between each focusing run, the capillaries were washed with the mixture of  acetone/ethanol to achieve the reproducible and efficient cief. in order to trace of ph gradients, low-molecular-mass pi markers were used. the mixed cultures of microorganisms, escherichia coli ccm 3954, candida albicans ccm 8180, candida parapsilosis, candida krusei, candida glabrata, candida tropicalis, ccm 8223, proteus vulgaris, klebsiela pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus ccm 3953, streptococcus agalactiae ccm 6187, enterococcus faecalis ccm 4224 and staphylococcus epidermidis ccm 4418, were focused and separated by the cief method suggested here. this cief method enables the separation and detection of the microbes from the mixed cultures within several minutes. the minimum detectable number of microbial cells was less than 10(3).

TI  == ability of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 to participate in bacterial translocation across the intestinal epithelial barrier.
AB  == although hundreds of microbial species reside in the human intestinal tract, comparatively few (e.g., escherichia coli and other enterobacteria, enterococcus  faecalis, etc.) are typically associated with systemic infection in postsurgical, shock, and trauma patients. syndecan-1 is the predominant cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed on epithelia, and there is substantial evidence that heparan sulfate participates in interactions of a variety of frankly pathogenic microbes with mammalian cells. to investigate the role of syndecan-1 in interactions of enteric flora with intestinal epithelium, bacteria that might  use the enterocyte as a portal of entry for systemic infection (including e. faecalis, e. coli, and other enterobacteria, and several species of staphylococci and streptococci) were studied for their abilities to interact with syndecan-1. streptococcus bovis, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and s. epidermidis showed increased adherence to arh-77 cells transfected to express syndecan-1. heparin, a heparan sulfate analog, inhibited internalization of s. bovis, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, and s. aureus by ht-29 enterocytes (prominent  syndecan-1 expression), but not caco-2 enterocytes (relatively low syndecan-1 expression). data from experiments with chinese hamster ovary cells with altered  glycosaminoglycan expression indicated that heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate (glycosaminoglycans on the syndecan-1 ectodomain) participated in bacterial interactions with mammalian cells. thus, although e. faecalis, e. coli, and other gram-negative enterobacteria did not appear to interact with syndecan-1, this heparan sulfate proteoglycan may mediate enterocyte interactions with some staphylococci and streptococci that are known to cause systemic infections in specific populations of high-risk, immunosuppressed, postsurgical,  and trauma patients.

(2) the 17 specimens which showed positive results by pcr were further hybridized on the gene chip. all were positive by universal probes. among all of them, 5 were positive by e. coli probe; 4 were positive by staphylococcus epidermidis; two were positive by bacillus and propionibacterium probes, separately; 4 were positive by cons. the 8 specimens which showed positive results by both pcr and blood culture, the result of gene chip hybridization coincided with the result of blood culture. conclusion: detection of the bacterial 16srrna genes in clinical specimens by gene chip hybridization technology can diagnose neonatal septicemia  rapidly. this method has higher sensitivity and specificity than blood culture or other methods and can provide a rapid way for the etiological diagnosis of neonatal septicemia. therefore the genechip method may be valuable and practical  in early diagnosis of neonatal septicemia.

AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. changes in the bacterial susceptibility for czop were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint mic. sixteen species (2,363 strains) of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the  clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis  (msse), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse), staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus saprophyticus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp), penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp), streptococcus milleri group and peptostreptococcus spp. the antibacterial activity of czop either against mssa or msse was preferable (mic90: 2 or 0.5 micrograms/ml) and comparable to those of other cephems. czop was also effective  on mrse (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) but not on mrsa. czop and other cephems had low antibacterial activity against s. haemolyticus (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than those of other cephems, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (32 vs 1-2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop  against e. faecalis was comparable to that of cefpirome (cpr; mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) and higher than those of other cephems. no antibacterial activity  of czop against e. faecium and e. avium was observed, like other drugs. the antibacterial activity of czop against s. pyogenes was as potent as those of cefotiam and cpr (mic90: < or = 0.063 microgram/ml), and, against s. agalactiae,  was also preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml). czop indicated preferable antibacterial activity either against pssp, pisp, or prsp (mic90: 0.25, 1, or 2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. milleri group was also preferable, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (4 vs 0.5 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than those of cefazolin and cefmetazole. the resistance ratio estimated from breakpoint mic of czop was 95.9% in mrsa, 93.5% in prsp, 63.3% in pisp, 35.8% in s. haemolyticus, 27.9% in e. faecalis, and 13.3% mrse. those resistance ratios were comparable to those for cefepime (cfpm), but e. faecalis showed 91.2% for cfpm. the difference in the resistance ratio of e. faecalis demonstrated that czop successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against these species. in correlation of drug susceptibility, 40.3% of prsp was not inhibited at breakpoint mic either czop or  cfpm while 69.2% at breakpoint mic either czop or ceftazidime. in conclusion, the antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria obtained from the 6-year duration study were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. a decline in the sensitivities of s. saprophyticus, s. milleri group, pisp, and prsp to czop, however, was suggested.

TI  == [yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--i. gram-positive bacteria].
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and  penicillins. a total of 1,274 strains in 15 species of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa),  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, and peptostreptococcus spp. czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 6 years. the mic90 of czop against mrsa and s. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against s. pneumoniae and peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. however, the mic90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. increases in the mic90 against s. pneumoniae were also observed with ceftazidime (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), flomoxef (fmox), sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz), and imipenem (ipm). increases  in the mic90 against peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with fmox, sbt/cpz, and ipm. in conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. it, therefore, was suggested that czop had maintained high antibacterial activity during 6 years of post marketing.

TI  == small-fragment genomic libraries for the display of putative epitopes from clinically significant pathogens.
AB  == taking advantage of whole genome sequences of bacterial pathogens in many thriving diseases with global impact, we developed a comprehensive screening procedure for the identification of putative vaccine candidate antigens. importantly, this procedure relies on highly representative small-fragment genomic libraries that are expressed to display frame-selected epitope-size peptides on a bacterial cell surface and to interact directly with carefully selected disease-relevant high-titer sera. here we describe the generation of small-fragment genomic libraries of gram-positive and gram-negative clinically significant pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus  pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, helicobacter pylori, chlamydia pneumoniae, the enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, and campylobacter jejuni. large-scale sequencing revealed that the libraries, which provide an average of 20-fold coverage, were random and, as demonstrated with two s. aureus libraries, highly representative. consistent with the comprehensive nature of this approach is the  identification of epitopes that reside in both annotated and putatively novel open reading frames. the use of these libraries therefore allows for the rapid and direct identification of immunogenic epitopes with no apparent bias or difficulty that often associate with conventional expression methods.

TI  == comparative in vitro potency of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid and four oral agents  against recent north american clinical isolates from a global surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was compared with four comparator oral antimicrobial agents; ampicillin, azithromycin, cefuroxime and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole against 4536 recent clinical isolates covering 29  species isolated in the us and canada between 1997 and 1999. based upon minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics), amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was the most active agent against many gram-positive species and phenotypes including methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin intermediate and macrolide resistant strains and was as active as ampicillin against streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae and viridans streptococci. against enterobacteriaceae amoxycillin-clavulanic acid in general,  displayed weak activity with only proteus mirabilis and proteus vulgaris displaying levels of susceptibility above the 90th percentile. amoxycillin-clavulanic acid had significant activity against many species of gram-negative non-enterobacteriaceae including haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae and moraxella catarrhalis but negligible activity against burkholderia cepacia, pseudomonas aeruginosa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. amoxycillin-clavulanic acid continues to retain excellent activity against the majority of targeted pathogens despite 20 years of clinical use.

TI  == subcutaneous drainage versus no drainage after minilaparotomy in gynecologic benign conditions: a randomized study.
AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to determine the outcomes of subcutaneous drainage in patients who are affected by benign gynecologic diseases that are treated by a kustner's minilaparotomy incision. study design: we performed a randomized controlled study with 72 patients who underwent operation  for benign gynecologic disease. patients were assigned intraoperatively to two groups: group a (36 patients) had a closed drainage system and group b (36 patients) had no drainage. historic data, clinical and surgical characteristics,  and perioperative complications were recorded prospectively. postoperative care data, surgical incision complications, and hospital stay were analyzed. patients  were to be seen 4 weeks after the operation to assess wound healing. results: no  patients had intraoperative complications or blood transfusions. a significant difference was observed between the drainage versus no-drainage groups regarding  postoperative complications and hospital stay (p =.001, both groups). no patients had surgical complications at 4 weeks after the last operation. conclusion: our data suggest that routine prophylactic subcutaneous drainage is indicated in patients who undergo kustner's minilaparotomy incision for benign gynecologic operation. drains significantly prevent wound complications and reduce hospital stay.

TI  == microbiological quality and somatic cell count of ewe milk with special reference to staphylococci.
AB  == a total 1502 useful half udders of 762 churra ewes from eight herds were aseptically sampled in midlactation to study both the bacteriological isolates and the scc of milk. corynebacteria, enterococci, micrococci, staphylococci, and  streptococci represented 11.2, 2.9, 1.4, 78.9, and 3.1% of all isolates, respectively. within staphylococci, novobiocin-sensitive species (71.1%) were much more frequently isolated than novobiocin-resistant ones (7.8%). staphylococcus epidermidis was the most prevalent species (53.2% of the isolates). log scc of uninfected half udder milk was 4.86. isolates of novobiocin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, micrococci, and corynebacteria were associated to low values of log scc (4.85 to 5.20). in contrast, infection by novobiocin-sensitive coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococci, and enterococci organisms was related to a sharp inflammatory response with log scc means between 5.92 and 6.32. the species that showed the highest log scc were pasteurella haemolytica (7.62), streptococcus agalactiae (7.28), and staphylococcus aureus (6.68). high prevalence of infections by novobiocin-sensitive staphylococci together with high scc related to such infections show a relevant role of these organisms in ewe mastitis. consequently, implementation of staphylococcal mastitis control programs would be of great interest in dairy ewe herds to improve microbiological and hygienic quality of milk.

TI  == [neonatal meningitis. epidemiological study of the grupo de hospitales castrillo].
AB  == objectives: a prospective multicenter study was designed to assess the incidence, etiology, risk factors and outcomes of vertically transmitted and nosocomial meningitis in neonates over a two-year period. patients and methods: cases of neonatal meningitis diagnosed between january 1, 1997 and december 31, 1998 in the neonatology departments of 28 acute-care hospitals in spain ("grupo de hospitales castrillo") were prospectively studied. bacteriological meningitis was considered confirmed when cerebrospinal fluid culture (csf) was positive for bacteria, virus or fungi, probable when csf culture was negative but blood culture was positive, and unconfirmed when both cultures were negative. results:  during the study period, 151 cases of meningitis were diagnosed. transmission was vertical in 84 cases and nosocomial in 67. the incidence of vertically transmitted meningitis was 0.51 of live births, and was significantly higher in very low birth weight (vlbw) infants. confirmed bacteriological meningitis was diagnosed in 66 patients (78.6 %). no risk factors were identified in 46.4 % of the patients. group b streptococcus (agalactiae) was isolated in 48.5 % of cases  of confirmed meningitis and escherichia coli was isolated in 18.2 %. in 69.7 % of cases the results of blood culture were in agreement with those of csf culture. the overall mortality rate was 8.3 %; mortality was significantly higher in vlbw  infants (33.3 % vs 4.2 % in infants weighing 1,500 g). thirteen percent of survivors had sequelae. the incidence of meningitis of nosocomial transmission was 0.2 % of admissions and was more frequent in vlbw infants. confirmed bacteriological meningitis was diagnosed in 49 patients (73.1 %). two or more risk factors were present in 62.7 % of patients. e. coli was isolated in 26.5 % of cases of nosocomial meningitis and staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated in  24.5 %. in 55 % of patients the results of blood culture agreed with those of csf culture. the overall mortality rate was 19.4 %. mortality was significantly higher in vlbw infants and 18.5 % of survivors showed sequelae. conclusions: the  incidence, mortality and sequelae of neonatal meningitis in spain were similar to those reported in recent studies. the most commonly isolated pathogens were group b streptococcus in vertically transmitted meningitis and e. coli and s. epidermidis in nosocomial meningitis. we believe the distinction between vertical and nosocomial meningitis to be appropriate because the epidemiology of these diseases is different, which implies a different therapeutic approach. the high percentage of positive blood cultures indicates the need to include lumbar puncture whenever systemic infection is suspected in the neonatal period.

TI  == evaluation of the vitek 2 system for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of medically relevant gram-positive cocci.
AB  == a study was conducted to evaluate the new vitek 2 system (biomerieux) for identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of gram-positive cocci. clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (n = 100), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) (n = 100), enterococcus spp. (n = 89), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 29), and streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 66) were examined with the id-gpc identification card and with the ast-p515 (for staphylococci), ast-p516 (for enterococci and s. agalactiae) and ast-p506 (for pneumococci) susceptibility cards. the identification comparison methods were the api staph for staphylococci and the api 20 strep for streptococci and enterococci; for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the agar dilution method according to the procedure of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) was used. the vitek 2 system correctly identified to the species level (only one choice or after simple supplementary tests) 99% of s. aureus, 96.5% of s. agalactiae, 96.9% of s. pneumoniae, 92.7% of enterococcus faecalis, 91.3% of staphylococcus haemolyticus, and 88% of staphylococcus epidermidis but was least able to identify enterococcus faecium (71.4% correct). more than 90% of gram-positive cocci were identified within 3 h. according to the nccls breakpoints, antimicrobial susceptibility testing with the vitek 2 system gave 96% correct category agreement, 0.82% very major errors, 0.17% major errors, and 2.7% minor errors. antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed category agreement from 94 to 100% for s. aureus, from 90 to 100% for cns, from 91 to 100% for enterococci, from 96 to 100% for s. agalactiae, and from 91 to 100% for s. pneumoniae. microorganism-antibiotic combinations that gave very major errors were cns-erythromycin, cns-oxacillin, enterococci-teicoplanin, and enterococci-high-concentration gentamicin. major errors were observed for cns-oxacillin and s. agalactiae-tetracycline combinations. in conclusion the results of this study indicate that the vitek 2 system represents an accurate and acceptable means for performing identification and antibiotic susceptibility tests with medically relevant gram-positive cocci.

AB  == we investigated activity of piperacillin (pipc) in comparison with 8 antibacterial reference drugs against several fresh clinical strains isolated from patients with infectious diseases in the respiratory tract and after surgical interventions in 1999. the following results were obtained: 1. pipc had  its mic90 of 0.12-6 micrograms/ml in gram-positive bacteria (methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis) and showed its mic of 1 microgram/ml or higher in 9 possible prsp strains out of 38 isolates of s. pneumoniae but there were no possible isolates with evident resistance in other species of bacteria. 2. pipc showed favorable antibacterial activities as its mic90 were 2-8 micrograms/ml in gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae), except for p. mirabilis in which its mic90  was as high as 64 micrograms/ml. 11 out of 39 isolates of p. mirabilis were resistant to other drugs such as pipc, abpc, ctm and czop. 3. pipc had its mic90  of > 128 micrograms/ml in bacteroides fragilis. from these results, pipc was considered highly effective in several infections in view of maintaining its favorable antibacterial activities in several causative bacteria even today when  20 years had passed since its first application to clinical practice.

TI  == use of pcr with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  == we have designed a universal pcr capable of amplifying a portion of the 16s rrna  gene of eubacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis,  streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, mycobacterium tuberculosis, legionella pneumophila, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. the sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most pcr products generated by haeiii digestion were different. pcr products from s. aureus and s. epidermidis could not be digested by haeiii but yielded different patterns when they were digested with mnli. pcr products from s. pneumoniae, e. faecium, and e. faecalis yielded the same haeiii digestion pattern but could be differentiated by alui digestion. pcr  products from e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and e. cloacae also had the  same haeiii digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with ddei  or bstbi. this universal pcr could detect as few as 10 e. coli or 250 s. aureus organisms. compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal pcr for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. these results suggest that this universal pcr coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the usa.
AB  == the antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (sb-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 gram-positive and 995 gram-negative organisms collected from various usa sites. time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (pae) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) 0. 016 mg/l), streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/l), streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/l), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/l), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  (0.03 mg/l), staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/l), staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/l). against gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. mic(90)s for gemifloxacin were: haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008  mg/l), moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/l), escherichia coli (0.016 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/l), klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/l), enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/l), enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/l), proteus spp. (4 mg/l), serratia spp. (1 mg/l), citrobacter freundii (2 mg/l), morganella morganii (0.12  mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/l), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/l) and acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/l). gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x mic. the pae for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at  2 and 4 x mic, although longer paes were observed with h. influenzae, p. aeruginosa and proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x mic) and shorter paes with e. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and k. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). in conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. it has substantially improved potency against gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. it retains the good gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged paes.

TI  == pyogenic psoas abscess: analysis of 27 cases.
AB  == from 1993 to 1998, 29 pyogenic psoas abscesses occurring in 27 patients were seen in taichung veterans general hospital. their age range was 25 to 85 years. diabetes mellitus was the leading underlying disease. fever and pain in the flank area, back and hip were the usual manifestations. the duration of symptoms prior  to the diagnosis ranged from 3 days to 6 months. most abscesses were diagnosed by computed tomography (ct) images and proven by abscess cultures, which were divided into primary and secondary types. eighteen of 29 abscesses were regarded  as primary. staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen in the primary abscesses, followed by streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, viridans streptococci, s. epidermidis, and salmonella spp.. in the secondary abscess category, e. coli was the leading organism in this series, followed by s. aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, viridans streptococci and candida albicans. the associated conditions included epidural abscess, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, perirenal  abscess, pulmonary tuberculosis, empyema, hydronephrosis and trauma history. the  initial empiric therapy comprised mostly of cefazolin or oxacillin with or without an aminoglycoside. thirteen patients underwent percutaneous drainage, while six received surgical debridement, including two with a recurrent abscess.  one patient had both drainage and debridement. others received medical treatment  only. two of the patients with primary abscess died in spite of percutaneous drainage. therefore, open drainage, besides appropriate antibiotic treatment, is  still required to control complex abscesses with sepsis.

AB  == the results of the semi-annual nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities, conducted by the japanese ministry of health and welfare during the period of january 1993 to july 1995, were analyzed for typical gram-positive  cocci and gram-negative cocci in the purpose of provision of an index for antimicrobial selection. during these 3 years, streptococcus pyogenes (group a) and streptococcus agalactiae (group b) showed slightly increasing tendency in susceptibility to ofloxacin (oflx) and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (st), while  streptococcus pneumoniae and moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis showed slightly  decreasing tendency to cefaclor (ccl). however, these annual changes were almost  negligible. generally, these microorganisms showed relatively good susceptibilities, every year, to the principal antimicrobial agents being approved for use against gram-positive and -negative cocci. however, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis showed tendencies of decreased susceptibility to some of the antimicrobial agents. on the other hand, cefmetazole (cmz), vancomycin (vcm), latamoxef (lmox), st and minocycline (mino) showed good activities against some of the gram-positive and -negative cocci to which no indication are approved. in conclusion, beside the identification of the causative microorganisms and the performance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, such analyses (graphics of susceptibility tendency of clinical isolates to variety of antimicrobial agents)  could be used as an index for selection of antimicrobial agents, when emergent and urgent selection of an antimicrobial agent is necessary.

TI  == passive deformability of mature, immature, and active neutrophils in healthy and  septicemic neonates.
AB  == obstruction of narrow vessels by rigid neutrophils may contribute to ischemic organ injury. in septicemia, a substantial portion of the neutrophils may become  activated and the number of circulating immature neutrophils may rise sharply. volume and deformability of mature (pmn) and immature neutrophils in healthy preterm and full-term infants and in septicemic neonates were studied by means of a micropipette system. membrane cytoplasm tongues were aspirated into 2.5-microm  (diameter) pipettes over a period of 60 s. volume and tongue growth of mature resting pmn were similar in healthy preterm and full-term neonates and adults. compared with mature pmn (about 360 fl), the volumes of band cells (415 fl), metamyelocytes (470 fl), and less mature cells (myeloblasts, promyelocytes, and myelocytes; 490 fl) were significantly increased (p < 0.005). final tongue lengths of band cells, metamyelocytes, and less mature cells were decreased by about 50, 60, and 70%, respectively, when compared with passive mature cells. in  septic neonates, the percentage of immature neutrophils was increased, but the deformability and volume of the cell subpopulations were not affected by septicemia. active pmn were characterized by pseudopod formation. more active pmn were found in group b streptococcal (14% of total pmn), gram-negative (12%), and  staphylococcus epidermidis septicemia (8%) than in healthy neonates and adults (4%). the main bodies of active pmn were less deformable than passive pmn, and the pseudopods showed very little membrane deformation. the increased number of rigid active and immature neutrophils may contribute to impaired microcirculation and the high risk for organ injury in septic patients.

AB  == objectives: besides its vasodilative actions, nitric oxide (no) is also involved  in host defense on a cellular level. we studied the antimicrobial properties of no in concentrations used with inhaled no therapy for the treatment of pulmonary  hypertension in neonates. design: in vitro study of bacterial growth of five species, with and without no exposure. setting: level iv neonatal intensive care  unit at a university children's hospital. subjects: in vitro bacterial cultures.  interventions: we tested ten different strains of five bacterial species (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, group b streptococcus [gbs/streptococcus agalactiae], escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa), derived from the tracheal isolates of ventilated premature and term infants. cultures were exposed to three different concentrations of no (40, 80, and 120 parts per million [ppm]) and bacterial growth was compared with the same strains  incubated in ambient air for 24 hrs. after incubation (with or without no), colony-forming units were counted. measurements and main results: bacterial growth of s. aureus, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa was not reduced with the no concentrations applied. the number of colony-forming units of s. aureus increased at 80 ppm of no. growth of s. epidermidis and gbs was significantly affected at 120 ppm, resulting in decreased numbers of colony-forming units as compared with  controls exposed to ambient air. conclusions: we conclude that no has a selective bacteriostatic effect on some of those bacteria most commonly cultured in tracheal specimens of premature infants and neonates. this effect appears to be dose-dependent and occurs in the upper range of dosages used with inhaled no therapy. however, in the range of dosages applied in ongoing controlled trials of inhaled no in neonates and premature infants (1 to 80 ppm), a bacteriostatic effect of no is not to be expected.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of roxithromycin against recently obtained clinical isolates].
AB  == the purpose of our investigation was to monitor current trends in the susceptibility patterns of clinical bacterial isolates to roxithromycin (rxm). we measured the mics of macrolide antibiotics, such as rxm, erythromycin (em), clarithromycin (cam), rokitamycin (rkm) and midecamycin (mdm), and other classes  of antibacterial compounds against various clinical isolates at seven institutions between october and december in 1994 and 1995. rxm had excellent antibacterial activities for s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, m. (b.) catarrhalis and  methicillin sensitive s. aureus. against methicillin sensitive s. epidermidis, rxm activity was fairly good but about 20% of the strains had mic > or = 128 micrograms/ml. the activity against s. pneumoniae was not so potent and similar to activities of em, cam, mdm, and clindamycin. the vast majority of methicillin  resistant s. aureus and s. epidermidis were also resistant to macrolide antibiotics and other classes of compounds tested. in conclusion, rxm is an unique macrolide antibiotic by retaining potent activity against s. pyogenes, s.  agalactiae, s. aureus except mrsa, m. (b.) catarrhalis and m. pneumoniae.

TI  == [infectious bursitis: study of 40 cases in the pre-patellar and olecranon regions].
AB  == background: septic bursitis usually affects subcutaneous localized bursae such the prepatellar and elbow bursae. this condition is infrequently reported in the  spanish medical literature. the aim of this report was to study patients suffering from septic bursitis with regard to predisposing conditions, the causative agents, therapy and clinical outcome. method: a retrospective study was undertaken in patients with infectious bursitis attended in the service of rheumatology of the povisa medical centre (vigo) and juan canalejo hospital (la coruna), spain, from january 1989 to january 1995. the diagnosis of septic bursitis was confirmed with positive bursal fluid cultures in all cases. results: we recovered forty cases of infectious bursitis (23 olecranon bursitis and 17 prepatellar bursitis). most patients were male (80%), and patient mean age was 52 years (range: 14-94). the most common predisposing factors to bacterial infection were steroid therapy (15%) and alcoholism (8%), in addition to cutaneous lesions  associated with occupational or recreational trauma (55%). prepatellar septic bursitis was associated with a more aggressive clinical presentation with fever (71% vs 48%), leukocytosis (76% vs 52%), cellulitis (59% vs 48%) and positive blood cultures (25% vs 0%). staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 87.5% of bursal fluid aspirations, the other etiologic microrganism were staphylococcus epidermidis (2 cases), streptococcus agalactiae (2 cases) and streptococcus pneumoniae (1 case). the majority of patients (80%) required initial intravenous  therapy of which average duration was 11 days (range: 5-21 days). successful resolution of septic bursitis without open surgical drainage was seen in 38 patients (95%) and there ware no functional impairment, serious complications or  recurrences. conclusions: the majority of patients with septic bursitis suffered  systemic and/or local predisposing illness. s. aureus is the commonest pathogen.  prepatellar septic bursitis is associated with a more aggressive clinical presentation and bacteremia. usually, the prompt and proper antibiotic therapy make innecessary surgical drainage.

TI  == in vitro activity of bay 12-8039, a new 8-methoxyquinolone.
AB  == bay 12-8039 is a new 8-methoxyquinolone with antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria which is significantly better than those of sparfloxacin or ciprofloxacin. the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) for 90% of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis were 0.062 and 2 mg/l, respectively. the mic90s for ciprofloxacin-resistant, methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant s. aureus were 8 mg/l. against  the staphylococcal strains tested sparfloxacin was 2-fold and ciprofloxacin > or  = 10-fold less active. mic90s for streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae were 0.125-0.5 mg/l, irrespective of whether strains with diminished ciprofloxacin susceptibility or ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains were tested. against the streptococci sparfloxacin was 2- to 4-fold less active. against gram-negative bacteria bay 12-8039 is almost as active as ciprofloxacin, except for pseudomonas aeruginosa.  against bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides spp. and clostridium spp. bay 12-8039 was as active as metronidazole. the bactericidal activity against s. aureus and s. pneumoniae was in contrast to that of the other quinolones tested, penicillin  g, amoxicillin+/-clavulanate, cefuroxime and clarithromycin, concentration-dependent. as compared to ciprofloxacin, development of resistance  was less pronounced. the spontaneous mutation frequency towards bay 12-8039 resistance was 2.8 x 10(-8) in escherichia coli, 7.06 x 10(-8) in s. aureus and < 1.4 x 10(-9) in s. pneumoniae.

TI  == volume of blood required to detect common neonatal pathogens.
AB  == objective: to determine the minimum volume of blood and the absolute number of organisms required for detection of bacteremia and fungemia by an automated colorimetric blood culture system (bact/alert, organon teknika). design: common neonatal pathogens, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus (gbs): one american type culture collection (atcc) strain and one clinical isolate), staphylococcus epidermidis, and candida albicans, were seeded  into blood to produce bacteremia or fungemia with low colony counts (1 to 3 colony-forming units (cfu) per milliliter) and ultra-low colony counts (<1 cfu/ml). for each organism, 96 culture bottles were inoculated with either 0.25,  0.5, 1.0, or 4.0 ml of the two seeded blood concentrations. blood culture bottles were incubated in the bact/alert device for 5 days, and time to positivity was noted when applicable. all bottles were subcultured on plated media. data analysis: the poisson statistic was used to calculate the probability of finding  at least one viable cfu per inoculated culture bottle. the fraction of culture bottles with positive findings per group was divided by the probability of one or more organisms present to give the positivity index. results: plated subculture identified no growth of organisms not detected by the colorimetric detection system. the false-positive rate for the automated device was less than 1%. the positivity index for the gbs clinical isolate was 1.13, for the gbs atcc isolate  0.96, for s. epidermidis 0.94, for c. albicans 0.97, and for e. coli 0.95. there  was a statistically significant difference with time to positivity and inocula volume (p <0.01), but the difference was not clinically important. conclusions: if one or two viable colony-forming units are in the blood inoculated into culture media, the bact/alert system will detect growth rapidly. because there appears to be a sizable subset of neonates who are at risk of sepsis with a colony count less than 4 cfu/ml, then a 0.5 ml inoculum of blood into the culture media is inadequate for sensitive and timely detection of bacteremia. one to two  milliliters of blood should increase microorganism recovery in the face of low-colony-count sepsis.

TI  == effects of different surfactant preparations on bacterial growth in vitro.
AB  == several lines of evidence suggest that surfactant and surfactant proteins may have direct effects on inhaled bacteria and are able to interact with lung defence mechanisms in many ways. we examined the effect of three different surfactant preparations (alveofact, survanta and exosurf) approved for treatment  of the infant respiratory distress syndrome on different strains of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus agalactiae which are important neonatal pathogens and on legionella pneumophila serogroup i as a frequent cause of pneumonia in adults. addition of survanta to saline seemed to delay the reduction of viable bacteria in sterile saline and induced a considerably accelerated growth of all examined e. coli strains. as opposed to this, addition of surfactant did not influence the kinetics of bacterial growth in brain-heart infusion or buffered yeast extract both with the  exception of exosurf which exerted an inhibitory effect on the multiplication of  group b streptococci. though the exact mechanisms underlying these effects remain to be determined, the influence of surfactant therapy on the growth of bacteria within the respiratory tract should be taken into account.

TI  == bacteriological epidemiology and treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == one hundred symptomatic women with clinical bacterial vaginosis (bv) were enrolled in this study. the bacteriological epidemiology of bv and efficacy of oral or vaginal administration of antimicrobial agents for treatment of bv were investigated. the epidemiology of bv was investigated before antimicrobial therapy. fifty patients were treated with oral administration of metronidazole (mtn), 500 mg twice a day, and 50 patients with 2% clindamycin (cldm) phosphate in a vaginal cream, 5 g once a day for 7 days. the major organisms occurring were streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, gardnerella vaginalis, peptostreptococcus species, bacteroides species, prevotella species, and mobiluncus species and opportunistic pathogens such as staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis. the therapeutic efficacy of cldm cream on bv appeared  to be preferable to oral mtn from clinical and bacteriological aspects. the clinical and bacteriological effectiveness of mtn and cldm in the treatment of bv suggests that anaerobes might play a major role in causing the clinical symptoms  in patients with bv.

AB  == several standard intravenous immunoglobulin g (ivig) products are available in the united states and have been used with the intent to treat or prevent infections in neonates. we evaluated more than 100 lots of ivig, from 6 products, to determine the amount of opsonic antibody against neonatal pathogens. neutrophil-mediated opsonophagocytosis was used to determine opsonic activity in  these preparations for staphylococcus epidermidis; haemophilus influenzae type b; streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 3, 14 and 19; group b streptococcus serotypes  ia, ib, ia/c, ii and iii; and escherichia coli (k1). pathogen-specific opsonic activity of the lots tested ranged from undetectable to 1:80 and was detectable in < 10% to > 90% of lots tested depending on the organism and manufacturer. within an ivig lot there was variable opsonic activity against different strains  or serotypes of the same organism. opsonic activity was significantly (p < or = 0.05) affected by the manufacturer's donor pool and less so by the manufacturing  method. we conclude that the pathogen-specific opsonic antibody activity of an ivig lot is: (1) highly variable for several common neonatal pathogens; (2) predominantly dependent on the donor pool and not the manufacturing method. clinicians may more appropriately select therapy if the pathogen-specific antibody content of ivig products by lot are known. in the future neonatal ivig research should focus on using preparations with known pathogen-specific antibody activity.

TI  == detection of bacterial dna in cerebrospinal fluid by an assay for simultaneous detection of neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, and streptococci using a seminested pcr strategy.
AB  == primers specific to conserved and variable regions in the 16s rrna sequence were  selected from the partially sequenced 16s rrna genes of neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. agalactiae, and staphylococcus epidermidis. the pcr assay was divided into two dna amplifications. the first resulted in a general bacterial amplicon, and the second resulted in a species-specific amplicon. the high specificity of the pcr assay was documented after testing bacteria of 28 different species (133 strains). a total of 304 clinical cerebrospinal fluid samples, including 125 samples from patients with bacterial meningitis, were assayed to investigate the  diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for bacterial meningitis. the assay showed high sensitivity (0.94) and specificity (0.96) with the clinical samples, although some false results were obtained, the reasons for which are discussed. with agarose gel electrophoresis for detection of the pcr products, the detection limit for meningococci in cerebrospinal fluid was 3 x 10(2) cfu/ml.

TI  == group b streptococcus-induced nitric oxide production in murine macrophages is cr3 (cd11b/cd18) dependent.
AB  == nitric oxide (no) is produced by murine macrophages in response to cytokines and/or gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide. no induction by gram-positive  bacteria such as group b streptococci (gbs), the major etiologic agents of neonatal pneumonia and meningitis, has received little study. gbs as well as two  other gram-positive bacterial species, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, were found to stimulate no production in thioglycolate-elicited murine macrophages and in the mouse macrophage cell line j774a.1 in the presence  of gamma interferon. serotype ia and iii gbs were both stimulatory, as were asialo- and type antigen-deficient mutant strains of type iii gbs. no production  was dose dependent, inhibitable by l-arginine analogs, and unaffected by polymyxin b. since phagocytosis by murine and human phagocytes of gbs is dependent on complement receptor type 3 (cr3), the role of cr3 in the no response to gbs was tested in the cr3-deficient myelomonocytic cell line wehi-3. gbs did not induce no, whereas s. aureus or lipopolysaccharide did induce no in wehi-3 cells. s. epidermidis, whose nonopsonic phagocytosis is also cr3 dependent, failed to induce no in wehi-3 cells. monoclonal anti-cr3 (anti-cd11b or anti-cd18) in the presence of interferon also induced no production in thioglycolate-elicited macrophages and in j774a.1 cells but not in wehi-3 cells.  this evidence suggests that ligated cr3 and gamma interferon act synergistically  to induce no production and that cr3 mediates the gbs-induced signal for no production in interferon-treated macrophages.

AB  == antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin (cam) in comparison with other 6 macrolides was determined against 419 recent clinical isolates including streptococci, enterococci, staphylococci, moraxella, haemophilus and bacteroides  strains. mics80's of cam against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae were 0.78, 0.10 and 0.10 microgram/ml, respectively. mics80's against moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae were 0.05 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. laboratory-induced resistance to cam in strains of s. pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis or methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus epidermidis occurred in stepwise fashion and at a very low rate. adherence to silicon filter of strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa or s. epidermidis was strongly repressed by the addition of sub-mic of cam or other macrolides. although tosufloxacin (tflx) alone had no bactericidal activity against the sessile cells of p. aeruginosa strains tested, tflx showed synergistic bactericidal activity when combined with sub-mics of cam or erythromycin.

TI  == neonatal sepsis and meningitis in mallorca, spain, 1977-1991.
AB  == in a retrospective study at son dureta hospital (palma de mallorca, mallorca, spain) of the period 1977-1991, 334 cases of culture-proven sepsis and/or meningitis in neonates born at the facility were identified. overall, there was an incidence rate of 4.9 cases per 1,000 live births. the case-fatality rate was  7.5%. infection was more frequent in infants of low birth weight, with the exception of infants with meningitis and infections due to group b streptococcus  and listeria species. the patterns of predominance among bacterial pathogens that were isolated changed during the period studied. from 1977 to 1984, klebsiella pneumoniae was the most frequent such isolate, but this frequency declined in the following years. group b streptococcus organisms and staphylococcus epidermidis replaced k. pneumoniae as the predominant pathogens in early- and staphylococcus  epidermidis replaced k. pneumoniae as the predominant pathogens in early- and late-onset infections, respectively. the frequency with which other pathogens were isolated did not vary significantly during the study period. invasive infection caused by candida organisms was found in two patients. the incidence of infection due to group b streptococci has increased in the last few years (to 2.4 cases per 1,000 live births in 1991) and has become a significant problem that requires a thorough epidemiological evaluation.

TI  == electron microscopic studies of endotracheal tubes used in neonates: do microbes  adhere to the polymer?
AB  == fourteen neonates intubated at birth for 1-16 days had a microbiological follow up. after removal, tubes were examined using electron microscopy. tubes became covered with a slimy accretion from the third day in place, independently of bacterial colonization, which was, in all but one cases, restricted to the rough  areas of the tubes. only candida albicans and the corresponding slimy coat were found on smooth areas of tube. cocci were noticed on 3 tubes. they were associated with the slimy accretion. transmission micrographs elicited a thick material that was lying between cocci and polymer. these results showed that, on  neonates' endotracheal tubes, accretion occurred independently of microbial colonization and that when colonization occurred, cocci adhered preferentially to a biological coat of human origin rather than the medical devices.

TI  == the relationship of tonsil bacterial concentration to surface and core cultures in chronic tonsillar disease in children.
AB  == fifty-five tonsils removed for chronic tonsillar disease (chronic tonsillitis and obstructive tonsillar hyperplasia) underwent surface swab and quantitative core cultures in order to identify the relationship between core bacterial concentration and the presence of aerobic bacteria on the tonsil surface. the accuracy of a single core culture was further established by quantitative cultures of 9 sections per tonsil in an additional 19 tonsils. the results indicate that many (61.5%) but not all aerobic bacteria which were found in the tonsil core were cultured from the surface of the tonsil. conversely, the tonsil  core bacteria with the highest bacterial concentrations are more likely to be present on the tonsillar surface and the greater the bacterial concentration, the more likely the bacteria are to be found in most if not all areas of the tonsil core. therefore, the core bacterial concentration appears to be related to the presence of aerobic bacteria on the tonsillar surface. surface bacteria may not,  however, be truly representative of the core bacterial environment. implications  for the management of chronic tonsillar disease will be discussed.

TI  == purification, composition, and activity of two bactenecins, antibacterial peptides of bovine neutrophils.
AB  == extracts of granules of bovine neutrophils are known to exhibit a marked antibacterial activity in vitro. by a simple, two-step chromatographic procedure, we have resolved two peptide components of the antibacterial system. they were named bac-5 and bac-7 from the general term bactenecin and had molecular masses of about 5 and 7 kilodaltons, respectively. over 45 and 20% of the amino acid residues in the two bactenecins are proline and arginine, respectively. the remaining amino acids are mainly hydrophobic (isoleucine, leucine, and phenylalanine). both bac-5 and bac-7 efficiently kill escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, and klebsiella pneumoniae. they also arrest the growth of enterobacter cloacae (mics, 25 to 200 micrograms/ml) but not of proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae (mic, greater than 200 micrograms/ml). finally, bac-7 but not bac-5 has mics of less than or equal to 200 micrograms/ml for pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus epidermidis. from the comparison between the efficient bactericidal concentrations in vitro and the estimated content of bactenecins in neutrophils (125 ng of bac-5 and bac-7 each per 10(6) cells), it is reasonable to conclude that the two cationic peptides may exert a major role in host defense against at least some microorganisms.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. a study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == mechanisms of bacterial opsonization by immune globulin intravenous: correlation  of complement consumption with opsonic activity and protective efficacy.
AB  == to study the mechanism of bacterial opsonization by immune globulin intravenous (igiv) complement consumption and polymorphonuclear leukocyte (pmnl) membrane receptor (fcrlo, cr1, and cr3)-mediated phagocytosis of staphylococcus epidermidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, and groups a and b streptococci were examined. igiv alone did not consume complement and showed no opsonic activity by itself for these organisms. when these bacteria were preopsonized in igiv, significant amounts of complement were consumed (44%-94%) and the uptake and killing of bacteria occurred. the in vitro opsonic activity of igiv for these organisms was significantly correlated with the amount of complement consumed by  the igiv-opsonized bacteria (r = .85, p less than .05). the in vivo protective efficacy of igiv also appeared to be directly associated with its ability to activate and consume complement (r = 1.0, p less than .001). antibodies to fcrlo  (leu 11) markedly inhibited phagocytosis of bacteria opsonized in igiv but not that of bacteria opsonized in specific igm. both cr1 and cr3 receptors on pmnls were involved in uptake, but the contribution of each is different with different organisms.

TI  == neonatal septicaemia in finland 1981-85. predominance of group b streptococcal infections with very early onset.
AB  == a survey of blood culture-confirmed neonatal septicaemia was carried out in seven delivery hospitals in 1981-85, for a second successive five-year period. the total number of cases was 377, to compare with 410 in the previous five-year period. group b streptococcus (gbs) was throughout the major pathogen (29%), followed by staphylococcus aureus (15%) and escherichia coli (14%), while staphylococcus epidermidis (10%) has emerged as a significant new causative agent. septicaemia with very early onset was predominant: 49% of the cases had onset within the first 24 hours; in the majority the symptoms were present from birth. gbs was responsible for 49% of the cases detected in the first 24 hours of life. the overall mortality was 20% as compared to 23% in the previous five-year  period, whereas in the very early onset septicaemia mortality was now 18%, down from the preceding 30%. despite the modest progress, gbs septicaemia with very early onset remains a significant problem, and effective preventive measures are  needed.

TI  == effects of fibronectin on the interaction of polymorphonuclear leukocytes with unopsonized and antibody-opsonized bacteria.
AB  == fibronectin (fn) affects the interaction of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmnls)  with certain bacteria. fn alone enhanced the response, in a chemiluminescence (cl) assay, of pmnls to staphylococcus aureus (p less than .05) and staphylococcus epidermidis (p less than .01) but had no effect on type iii, group b streptococci (gbs) or escherichia coli. when gbs or e. coli were first preopsonized in antibody, fn significantly enhanced the cl response of pmnls (p less than .05). the intracellular metabolic inhibitor nan3 but not the extracellular scavengers superoxide dismutase or human serum albumin inhibited fn-enhanced cl; this fact suggests that enhancement of the respiratory burst by fn is an intracellular event. we used an acridine orange-crystal violet monolayer assay to examine the effects of fn on ingestion and intracellular killing of bacteria by pmnls. fn alone promoted uptake and killing of s. aureus (p less than .01) and s. epidermidis (p less than .05) by pmnls but did not enhance monolayer  phagocytosis of gbs or e. coli, unless these bacteria were preopsonized in antibody (p less than .01).

TI  == thromboxane-associated pulmonary hypertension during three types of gram-positive bacteremia in piglets.
AB  == thromboxane-associated pulmonary hypertension occurs in animals during intravenous infusion of group b streptococcus (gbs), a gram-positive neonatal pathogen. we postulated that other gram-positive neonatal pathogens, such as streptococcus fecalis (ent) and staphylococcus epidermidis (s. epi) would also induce increased thromboxane synthesis and pulmonary hypertension when infused into piglets. we observed similar hemodynamic and gas exchange abnormalities during stepwise increases in the dose of gbs, ent, and s. epi (n = 3, 4, and 4 piglets receiving each bacteria, respectively). pulmonary vascular resistance increased significantly in the absence of acidosis or reduced arterial or mixed venous po2 at a dose of 2.5 x 10(8) cfu/kg/h for ent and s. epi. in 14 additional piglets, pulmonary vascular resistance increased markedly after 60 min of intravenous infusion of 4 +/- 1 x 10(8) cfu/kg/h for each organism (p less than 0.05, gbs: 11.7 +/- 1.8 to 75.6 +/- 18.4 mm hg/liter/min, ent: 12.7 +/- 1.7 to 64.9 +/- 10.6 mm hg/liter/min, s. epi: 10.5 +/- 0.8 to 56.9 +/- 6.0 mm hg/liter/min), and blood thromboxane b2 levels increased (p less than 0.05, gbs:  30 +/- 10 to 1830 +/- 330 pg/ml, ent: 20 +/- 7 to 1110 +/- 300 pg/ml, s. epi: 31  +/- 9 to 1260 +/- 350 pg/ml). this dose of each bacteria caused a similar degree  of mild arterial hypoxemia (57-66 mm hg). the thromboxane synthetase inhibitor, dazmegrel, completely reversed pulmonary hypertension, reduced txb2 levels to near baseline values, and partially reversed arterial hypoxemia despite ongoing bacterial infusion. we conclude that thromboxane-associated pulmonary hypertension occurs in piglets during infusion of different gram-positive neonatal pathogens.

TI  == efficacy of teicoplanin as antimicrobial treatment of severe nosocomial infections caused by gram-positive bacteria: a preliminary study.
AB  == we used single daily intravenous teicoplanin as therapy for 12 severe nosocomial  infections caused by gram-positive bacteria. a daily dosage of 3-6 mg/kg was usually adopted; however, in selected cases the dosage was increased to 8-9.5 mg/day on the basis of serum bactericidal monitoring. most of these infections were life-threatening and included ventriculitis/meningitis (3 cases), sepsis (3  cases), mediastinitis (1 case) and extensive burn wound infection (1 case). staphylococcus aureus was by far the most frequent pathogen and methicillin-resistant strains were isolated in 7 out of 9 infections caused by this organism. the remaining isolates were staphylococcus epidermidis, jk corynebacterium, streptococcus agalactiae and propionilbacterium acnes. additional antibiotics were used in 5 cases for concomitant gram-negative bacillus etiology (2 cases), granulocytopenia (2 cases), superinfection (1 case). overall a clinical success and microbial eradication were documented in 100% and  91% of 12 cases, respectively. except one case of fever, no other major adverse effect was observed and no patient required trial therapy discontinuation. in conclusion, our preliminary data seem to suggest a satisfactory activity of teicoplanin against nosocomial gram-positive infections.

TI  == bactericidal activity of teicoplanin in an in-vitro two-compartment kinetic model.
AB  == the bactericidal activity of teicoplanin was studied in a model system in which antibiotic concentration is continuously varied. a two-compartment open model was used to reproduce, in vitro serum pharmacokinetics of teicoplanin in humans during 24 h after iv administration. staphylococcal and streptococcal strains of  various species were tested. teicoplanin showed rapid killing of staphylococcus epidermidis and staph. hominis. all strains of staph. epidermidis were rapidly killed in spite of the high mic values (4-16 mg/l). the killing effect against staph. haemolyticus was less rapid and marked than against staph. epidermidis, with strain to strain variation. a 99.9% kill was achieved for most strains within 22 h, but with other isolates regrowth occurred which was due to the presence of highly resistant cells in the original population. other staphylococci (staph. aureus, staph. saprophyticus) and streptococcus pyogenes, str. bovis and str. salivarius were reduced by 99.9% within 22 h. bactericidal activity against other streptococci (str. mutans, str. agalactiae, str. faecalis, str. faecium) was less marked; against str. sanguis teicoplanin was bacteriostatic.

AB  == in a prospective study to determine the incidence and etiology of neonatal septicemia at karolinska hospital, stockholm, all cases of neonatal septicemia in infants born at the hospital from 1981 to 1985 were reviewed. there were 4.0 cases of neonatal septicemia per 1,000 live births during the study period. during the five year period the incidence of septicemia tended to increase, mainly due to the increasing incidence of septicemia in infants with a birth weight below 1,500 grams. the single most common causative organism was group b streptococci with an incidence of 1.4 per 1,000 live births, staphylococcus aureus accounting for 1.1 cases, staphylococcus epidermidis for 0.7 cases, and gram-negative rods for only 0.4 cases per 1,000 live births. in a retrospective study of the incidence of neonatal septicemia in a non-selected patient population, all cases in the stockholm area in 1983 were reviewed. in that year there were 17,586 live births in the area and the incidence of neonatal septicemia was 2.6 per 1,000 live births. group b streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and gram-negative rods were equally common as  causative agents.

TI  == silver-coated nylon fiber as an antibacterial agent.
AB  == a blend of nylon fiber and silver-coated nylon fiber (the latter known as x-static) was used in these experiments. this fiber was bactericidal when bacteria were exposed to it directly or to an extract derived from its prior incubation in salt solution. at ambient temperatures, a rapid exponential decrease of survival occurred, usually after a delay of approximately 1 h. the rate of killing (decrease of survival) increased with an increase in x-static percentage of the fiber blend, temperature of fiber extraction, concentration of  tris buffer present during extraction, and temperature at which bacteria were exposed to the extract. when bacteria were exposed to the extract at 37 degrees c as opposed to ambient temperature, there was no delay in onset of killing. escherichia coli was generally the indicator organism tested, but comparable results were also found for pseudomonas, klebsiella, staphylococcus, and streptococcus species. the rate of killing increased with increasing silver ion concentration of the fiber extract, as determined through atomic absorption spectrophotometry. the rate of killing was greater and the onset was earlier with an extract containing silver ions from fiber than with a salt solution containing the same concentration of silver ions from silver nitrate. studies of the kinetics of ion release suggested that x-static may be an effective, sustained-release antibacterial agent.

AB  == nalidixic and five newer 4-quinolones, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and pefloxacin were tested against 576 recent clinical aerobic bacterial isolates. the 4-quinolones were regularly active (mic90 less than 4 mg/l) against the following bacteria: staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. saprophyticus, different enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, campylobacter jejuni, pseudomonas aeruginosa, agrobacter spp., aeromonas spp., plesiomonas spp., neisseria meningitidis. other bacteria were usually intermediately susceptible or resistant: different streptococci, listeria monocytogenes, nocardia asteroides, p. maltophilia, achromobacter xylosoxydans and alcaligenes denitrificans. ciprofloxacin was the most potent compound, followed by ofloxacin and pefloxacin, norfloxacin and enoxacin being less active. all the 4-quinolones were much more active than nalidixic acid. the mbc/mic ratios of the 4-quinolones were between 1 and 2 with a majority of strains, and between 2 and 3 with streptococcus agalactiae, str. faecalis and l. monocytogenes. a two- to eight-fold increase of mic was observed by increasing the inoculum 10,000-fold with most of the strains tested. susceptible bacterial population of klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens and p. aeruginosa contained more clones resistant to nalidixic acid (10(4) to 10(8) at four times the mic) than to 4-quinolones (10(5) to 10(9) at four times the mic). supplementing the media with mgso4 produced smaller inhibition zone diameters with a disc diffusion method than those obtained with non-supplemented  agar, with all quinolone or strains. less regular effect, or no effect was obtained after supplementation with znso4 or ca(no3)2.

TI  == does the hygroscopic property of the laminaria tent imply a risk for ascending infection in legal abortions? a microbiological study.
AB  == in 53 women admitted for first-trimester abortion, the cervical canal was dilated with laminaria tents prior to vacuum aspiration. before insertion of the tents, endocervical specimens were taken for microbiological investigations, including chlamydia trachomatis, and both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. the laminaria tents, widened by their hygroscopic properties, were removed just before the vacuum aspiration and sent for cultivation of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. the gram-positive aerobic cocci, staph. epidermidis, strept. faecalis and strept. agalactiae as well as escherichia coli and klebsiella/enterobacter were the most frequent microorganism among the aerobic isolates from the endocervices as well as from the laminaria tents. these microorganisms were identified on the tents in greater numbers than in the cervices. staph. aureus was isolated from three laminaria tents, but only one of  these 3 women was proved to be primarily colonized endocervically. among the anaerobes, bacteroidaceae followed by peptococci and peptostreptococci were the predominant genera found in the cervix as well as on the removed laminaria tents. these three groups of anaerobic microorganisms were found markedly less frequently on the laminaria tents than in the endocervix. on the other hand, strept. intermedius, another anaerobe of possible enteric origin, was recovered from 9 laminaria tents but not in the cervices. since no cases of clinically verified endometritis/salpingitis were registered in the present study it is concluded that the risk of a pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) due to the laminaria tent is negligible as long as the laminaria treatment does not exceed 24 hours.

TI  == role of cephalosporins in the treatment of bacterial meningitis in adults. overview with special emphasis on ceftazidime.
AB  == experience with the use of first-generation cephalosporins in bacterial meningitis has been disappointing; low concentrations were obtained in the cerebrospinal fluid, and therapeutic failures were encountered. of the second-generation cephalosporins cefamandole, cefuroxime, and cefoxitin, only cefuroxime has proved efficacy in meningitis caused by meningococci, pneumococci, or hemophilus influenzae. the third-generation cephalosporins offer new advantages in the treatment of meningitis because they are active at the cerebrospinal fluid concentrations obtainable. cefotaxime has produced high cure  rates in patients with meningitis caused by meningococci, pneumococci, or h. influenzae. several controlled comparative studies indicate that ceftriaxone is as effective as conventional treatment in therapy for neonatal or childhood meningitis caused by streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, or h. influenzae. moxalactam has been found in uncontrolled studies to be effective when the cause was enteric gram-negative bacilli. ceftazidime is a new cephalosporin with a high degree of beta-lactamase stability and a broad antibacterial spectrum, which includes pseudomonas aeruginosa that enters the cerebrospinal fluid. data from 29 patients who received ceftazidime as monotherapy for bacterial meningitis showed an overall cure or improvement rate of 75.9 percent. therapy failed in three patients with meningitis caused by gram-positive organisms (staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. agalactiae), and in three with gram-negative organisms. of 14 patients with pseudomonas meningitis, 11 showed a cure, as did six of six patients with meningitis caused by enterobacter, serratia, or acinetobacter. more, preferably controlled, studies of the efficacy of ceftazidime in the treatment of meningitis should be undertaken.

AB  == an analysis was made of 91 cases of infective endocarditis (ie) with regard to causative organisms and their sensitivities to various antibiotics, the clinical  features of the disease, the laboratory test results and other items were important in establishing a diagnosis of ie. the number of cases of ie has shown  a tendency to increase in recent years, particularly in the number of elderly patients, and the ratio of total cases consisting of prosthetic valve endocarditis (pve) has shown a sharp increase. the most common causative organism is still streptococcus viridans, but there has been an increase in the incidence  of ie due to benzyl-penicillin-resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis and other fastidious organisms. the percentage of underlying diseases represented by combined valvular diseases has been increasing, while the primary known cause of the infection of ie was dental treatments. a positive value for crp, an accelerated value for esr, leukocytosis, anemia, a decrease in serum fe, a positive value for ra-t, were all parameters which showed a high correlation with ie, and these should be useful in establishing the diagnosis of ie. the use of cardioechography to detect cardiac vegetation is important in relation to establishing the diagnosis and prognosis of ie, and the evaluation of the therapeutic results.

TI  == asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy with special reference to group b streptococci.
AB  == the relationship between significant bacteriuria (sb), i.e. 2 subsequent voided urine specimens with greater than or equal to 10(5) colony forming units (cfu)/ml, and the occurrence of bacteria in the urinary bladder detected by bladder punction, was investigated in asymptomatic pregnant women. from 30 (70%)  of the 43 women with sb studied, bacteria were isolated from the urinary bladder. the same bacteria were found in the bladders of all 21 women with escherichia coli, the one with klebsiella pneumoniae, and the one with staphylococcus saprophyticus in midstream urine. six of 10 patients with group b streptococci (gbs), 1 of 4 patients with streptococcus faecalis, and none of 5 patients with staphylococcus epidermidis in voided specimens had bacteria in the aspirated urine. serotype iii was isolated from 8/10 patients with sb caused by gbs. one child born to a woman with gbs sb but no bacteria in the urinary bladder, got early onset septicaemia. the poor predictive value of sb with gbs, s. faecalis and s. epidermidis necessitates the increased use of bladder puncture for diagnosis of true asymptomatic bacteriuria (ab), i.e. ab with bacteria in the urinary bladder. sb with gbs even without bacteria in the urinary bladder, may constitute a threat to the baby's health.

TI  == human serum amyloid p component, a circulating lectin with specificity for the cyclic 4,6-pyruvate acetal of galactose. interactions with various bacteria.
AB  == serum amyloid p component (sap), a normal plasma glycoprotein, has recently been  shown to have ca2+-dependent binding specificity for methyl 4,6-o-(1-carboxyethylidene)-beta-d-galactopyranoside (mo beta dg) [hind, collins, renn, cook, caspi, baltz & pepys (1984) j. exp. med. 159, 1058-1069]. sap was found to bind in vitro to klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, the cell wall of which is  known to contain this particular cyclic pyruvate acetal of galactose. sap also bound in similar amounts (approx. 6000 molecules per organism) to group a streptococcus pyogenes, but very much less was taken up on xanthomonas campestris, which contains the 4,6-cyclic pyruvate acetal of mannose. no sap bound to escherichia coli, which contains the 4,6-cyclic pyruvate acetal of glucose, or to streptococcus pneumoniae type 4, which contains the 2,3-cyclic pyruvate acetal of alpha- rather than beta-galactopyranoside, or to other organisms (streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis), the carbohydrate structures of which are less well characterized. binding of sap to those organisms which it did recognize was completely inhibited or reversed by millimolar concentrations of free mo beta dg. sap, a human plasma  protein, thus behaves as a lectin and may be a useful probe for its particular specific ligand in the cell walls of bacteria and other organisms.

TI  == mode of action and in-vitro activity of vancomycin.
AB  == vancomycin is a unique glycopeptide structurally unrelated to any currently available antibiotic. it also has a unique mode of action inhibiting the second stage of cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. there is also evidence that vancomycin alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits  ribonucleic acid synthesis. induction of bacterial l-phase variants from susceptible organisms with vancomycin is extremely difficult, and such variants are unstable. stable l-phase variants induced by other agents are susceptible to  vancomycin. vancomycin is active against a large number of species of gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), staph. epidermidis (including multiple-resistant  strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiple-resistant strains), str. pyogenes, str. agalactiae, str. bovis, str. mutans, viridans streptococci, enterococci, clostridium species, diphtheroids, listeria monocytogenes, actinomyces species and lactobacillus species. there has been no increase in resistance to vancomycin during the past three decades. enhancement of antimicrobial activity has been demonstrated with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against staph. aureus, str. bovis, enterococci and viridans streptococci. the combination of vancomycin and rifampicin are antagonistic to most strains of staph. aureus, though indifference and occasionally synergism have been shown, but is synergistic against strains of staph. epidermidis. it shows indifference against enterococci. vancomycin and fusidic acid are indifferent against staph. aureus.

TI  == evaluation of rapid identification of gram-positive cocci in positive blood cultures by use of the automicrobic system gram-positive identification card.
AB  == because rapid identification of gram-positive organisms from blood cultures may provide valuable information for patient care and because the automicrobic system gram-positive identification (ams-gpi) card (vitek systems, inc., hazelwood, mo.) is designed for the identification of these organisms in 4 to 13 h, we designed this study to evaluate the performance of the ams-gpi card in the direct identification of gram-positive organisms upon detection of growth in blood culture bottles. we compared direct identification by the ams-gpi card with the final ams-gpi card identification and with our standard identification methods. we evaluated 51 gram-positive organisms from clinical blood cultures as well as 49 simulated blood cultures. the isolates included streptococcus pneumoniae (17), streptococcus pyogenes (13), group d enterococci (12), streptococcus agalactiae (11), viridans streptococci (10), coagulase-negative staphylococci (21), staphylococcus aureus (15), and listeria monocytogenes (1). the ams-gpi card identified all of the group d enterococci, viridans streptococci, and coagulase-negative staphylococci and all but one each of the streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae isolates. l. monocytogenes was also correctly identified. however, the ams-gpi card identified only 12 of 17 streptococcus pneumoniae and 9 of 15 staphylococcus aureus isolates by direct inoculation. we therefore conclude that the results of direct identification of gram-positive organisms by the ams-gpi card may be used cautiously for rapid direct identification of gram-positive organisms from positive blood cultures.

TI  == relationships between linear type scores, objective type measures, and indicators of mastitis.
AB  == objectives were to examine the usefulness of objective measures of conformation and linear scores for type for predicting indicators of mastitis. approximately 300 cows in five herds were scored in the experimental linear classification program of the holstein-friesian association of america, measured objectively for numerous components of conformation, and evaluated for four indicators of mastitis. indicators of mastitis were average natural logarithm of somatic cell counts during the lactation, percent of samples (taken approximately every 3 mo)  infected during a lactation, percent of samples infected with staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella, and percent of samples with signs of mastitic milk. relationships between conformation and mastitis often were inconsistent because of moderate or low correlations between  indicators of mastitis. indicators of mastitis were predicted from results of multiple regression analyses with subjective scores and objective measures of type as independent variables. largest differences of predicted indicators of mastitis from variation in any single type trait were sufficient to be important  economically, but average differences were much smaller. selection to reduce frequencies of cows with deep udders, especially low rear udders, widely placed teats, rear teats too far back, and teats that are short and wide, may augment, modestly, efforts to reduce incidence of mastitis through improved sanitation, antibiotic treatment, and proper milking procedures.

TI  == chloralanyl and propargylglycyl dipeptides. suicide substrate containing antibacterials.
AB  == a set of dipeptides containing the amino acid residues beta-chloroalanine and propargylglycine, which are mechanism-based inactivators of purified microbial enzymes (alanine racemase and cystathionine gamma-synthase, respectively), have been synthesized, and their antibacterial properties in vitro have been evaluated. dipeptides containing a single beta-chloro-l-alanyl residue (e.g., 3,  5, 9, and 10) or a single l-propargylglycyl residue (e.g., 12 and 15) are potent  antibacterials. the in vitro antibiotic activity of beta-chloro-l-alanine and of  l-propargylglycine is increased as much as 4000-fold by incorporation of these residues into a dipeptide. compounds that contain only a single enzyme-inactivating amino acid together with a second l-alanyl residue (3, 5, 12, and 15) have a restricted range of activity: of the species tested, only streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis are sensitive. however, peptides that contain two suicide-substrate residues [e.g., beta-cl-lala-beta-cl-lala (8) or lppgly-lppgly (18)] are broad-spectrum antibacterials; as many as 12 different species of the 16 surveyed are sensitive. dipeptides that contain an amino-terminal l-methionyl (9) or an l-norvalyl (10) residue and a carboxy-terminal beta-chloro-l-alanyl unit are also effective against a large number of organisms; the spectra of activity are like those seen  for 8 and 18. a "mixed" dipeptide [beta-cl-lala-lppgly, (21)] gives apparent synergism of antibiotic action of beta-chloro-l-alanine and of l-propargylglycine when these two residues are incorporated into a single structure. peptides of the d,d configuration (4, 6, 13, 16, and 20) and ones of l,d stereochemistry (e.g., 7) are not antibacterials. peptides containing one (11 and 14) and two (17) d,l-propargylglycyl residues are unresolved sets of diastereomers; the mixtures of compounds are between two- and fourfold less active than the correspondingly resolved l,l dipeptides (12, 15, and 18). these findings are consistent with a mechanism of action for these antibiotics involving stereoselective processing of the peptidyl unit in vivo.

TI  == effects of antibiotic treatment of nonlactating dairy cows on antibiotic resistance patterns of bovine mastitis pathogens.
AB  == antibiotic resistance patterns of the major groups of bovine mastitis pathogens (streptococcus agalactiae, other streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis) were examined by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of 13 different antibiotics against bacterial isolates from dairy cattle. the bacterial strains were obtained from milk samples from each cow in 21 new york state dairy herd surveys. in 12 herd surveys (high antibiotic-use  group), all 365 cows received antibiotic infusions into the udder at the cessation of each lactation cycle. the 324 animals in the other nine herd surveys (low antibiotic-use group) did not routinely receive antibiotics during the nonlactation period. the mics from the two groups were compared by calculating for each bacterial group the average mic, the antibiotic concentration necessary  to inhibit 90% of the isolates, and the antibiotic concentration necessary to inhibit 50% of the isolates. increased resistance to all 13 antibiotics was observed with streptococcus agalactiae isolates from the high antibiotic use herds. however, there was relatively little difference between the two groups in  the resistance patterns of the other bacterial species examined. the most important finding of the study was the identification of a multiple beta-lactam resistance phenotype in streptococcus agalactiae.

TI  == diagnosis and treatment of acute mastitis in a large dairy herd.
AB  == in a 270-cow dairy herd, milk samples from all cows with acute mastitis were cultured during a 12-month period. of 119 isolates (from 166 quarters), 49% were  gram-positive organisms, 39% were gram-negative organisms, and 12% were yeasts. of all samples from cows with acute mastitis, 40% failed to produce colonies on culture media. recovery of the common gram-positive pathogens, staphylococcus aureus (11% of isolations) and streptococcus agalactiae (1% of isolations), was rather low. however, s epidermidis (14% of isolations) and streptococci other than str agalactiae (9% of isolations) were recovered more frequently than expected, particularly in recently calved cows. coliform organisms accounted for  35% of the total isolates and were the single most important cause of acute mastitis. of 42 cows with coliform mastitis, 6 died despite intensive antibiotic  and electrolyte therapy. there was no death loss among cows with mastitis caused  by gram-positive organisms. antimicrobial susceptibilities of 95 isolates to 11 antimicrobials was determined by standardized methods. organisms were most often  susceptible to chloramphenicol, cephalothin, and gentamicin. a treatment regimen  consisting primarily of oxytetracycline and/or sulfonamides systemically in conjunction with intramammary infusions of cephapirin was evaluated. treatment response in 37 quarters was determined by culturing before treatment and at 4 or  more days after treatment. of 23 quarters initially culture-positive, 22 were negative on reculture. treatment response appeared to agree with the results of the susceptibility testing.

AB  == an experimental product incorporating 500,000 iu of procaine penicillin g and 600 mg of sodium novobiocin in 2% aluminum monostearate-peanut oil gel (10-ml dose) was used to treat all quarters of 56 cows which were infected in at least 1 quarter at time of final mild-out at end of lactation. treatment was withheld from 89 cows uninfected in all quarters. quarter infection was determined by bacteriologic culturing of milk samples collected at the last regular milking, at intervals up to final milk-out (7 or 12 days later), at calving, and 1 week later. clearance rates against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococci other than streptococcus agalactiae, and coliform bacteria in treated quarters were 83, 94, 88, and 71%, respectively. subtraction of the spontaneous clearance rate of about 50% in untreated quarters resulted in values  of 35 to 45% for drug efficacy against existing staphylococcal and streptococcal  infections. prophylactic efficacy was examined. in cows entering the true nonlactating period with 1 or more quarters infected, new infection rates across  the period aming quarters uninfected at the beginning were 36.0% among untreated  cows and 6.3% among treated cows (p less than 0.005). the comparable rates for cows entering the nonlactating period uninfected in all quarters were 5.7 and 0%. staphylococcus aureus and streptococci, which comprised 38.5% of new period infections among untreated cows, were completely lacking among treated cows (p less than 0.025). within the treated group of cows, 83.1% of infected quarters were cleared, and new infection rate in the non-lactating period was 50% less than the rate among untreated cows. because the frequency of intramammary infection in this herd was quite low at "drying-off" (10.5% of quarters), the net effect on herd health of selective therapy of cows infected at end of lactation was a reduction in total quarter infection from 19.8 to 13.6%.

AB  == colonization of the urethrovaginal area precedes urinary tract infection in women. among the potential factors limiting colonization by fecal pathogens is bacterial interference, the ability of established commensals to inhibit colonization by pathogenic bacteria. since the microcontour of the canine distal  urethra possesses microvilli like those in the vagina rather than the microplicae found at higher levels and also has similarities in cellular glycogen content the meatal area would be expected to respond to hormonal influences like the vagina.  the normal canine urethrovaginal flora was determined by serial cultures. it consisted principally of staphylococcus epidermidis, corynebacterium and acinetobacter-haemophilus. estrus produced a selective overgrowth of beta-streptococcus and acinetobacter-haemophilus. a normal canine transient, escherichia coli, and a normal resident, corynebacterium, persisted only for a short time (4.5 days) unless inoculated during estrus, when they remained for a mean period of 70 days. in contrast, human escherichia coli and pseudomonas persisted only a short time, whether during anestrus (4.8 days) or during estrus  (8.5 days). the commensals had returned fully by 14 days after sterilization, while those in estrus overresponded. thus, indigenous bacteria inhibit establishment of certain foreign species in the urethra and hormones enhance the  susceptibility to colonization.

TI  == migration inhibition of peritoneal macrophages by peptidoglycan.
AB  == previous studies have shown that peptidoglycans from group a and b streptococci inhibit the migration of peritoneal exudate cells from non-sensitized rats and guinea pigs. in the present studies peptidoglycans from s. aureus and s. epidermidis were found to inhibit the migration of cells to the same extent as group a streptococcal peptidoglycan. in contrast, hsa-pentapeptide, an immunologically active synthetic analog of the peptide moiety of peptidoglycan which is free of the intrinsic toxicity of naturally occurring peptidoglycans, did not induce migration inhibition of peritoneal exudate cells from non-sensitized guinea pigs. sensitization of animals with 200 mug hsa-pentapeptide emulsified in incomplete freund's adjuvant significantly reduced the inhibitory effect of streptococcal and staphylococcal peptidoglycan; hsa-pentapeptide again showed no activity. however, when hsa-pentapeptide was tested against cells from animals sensitized with 200 mug hsa-pentapeptide incorporated in complete freund's adjuvant, a strong inhibition of migration was  evident. skin tests performed in these animals, in contrast to the dermonecrotic  reaction elicited by streptococcal or staphylococcal peptidoglycan, revealed a characteristic delay hypersensitivity to hsa-pentapeptide.

TI  == intramammary infections in the sow during the peripartum period.
AB  == the incidence and ype of aerobic bacteria causing intramammary infection (imi) in two groups of peripartum sows were determined. the incidence of imi in 24 sows near farrowing was 30.2 percent; the incidence in 16 machine-milked sows was 81.0 percent. numerous mixed imi were detected. the bacterium causing most imi was staphylococcus epidermidis, followed by beta hemolytic streptococci, aslpha hemolytic streptococci, escherichia coli, and diphtheroids. the beta hemolytic streptococci and e. coli cultures were studied in detail. the relationship of bacterial imi to agalactiae toxemia is discussed.
