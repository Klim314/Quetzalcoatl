TI  == microbiota of rapidly progressive periodontitis lesions in association with clinical parameters.
AB  == the microbial population in 73 rapidly progressive periodontitis (rpp) lesions in 10 young adults aged 25 to 35 years (5 males, 5 females) was studied in relation  to the clinical parameters probing depth, bleeding on probing, and suppuration, which were recorded at the sampled sites. porphyromonas gingivalis was found to predominate (26.7%) in 73 periodontal lesions with clinical probing depth > 6 mm, followed by bacteroides forsythus (23.6%), and prevotella intermedia (15.7%). the prevalence of p. gingivalis was 91.7%, fusobacterium nucleatum, 90.4%; streptococcus intermedius, 87.7%; and b. forsythus, 53.4%. significant differences between bleeding index 0, 1, and 2 (p < 0.05) in frequency of detection were found for p. intermedia, campylobacter concisus, selenomonas sputigena, and peptostreptococcus micros at bleeding sites and for streptococcus  sanguis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and b. forsythus (p < 0.001) at non-bleeding sites. between suppurating and non-suppurating sites, significant differences (p < 0.05) in frequency of isolation were found for p. intermedia, capnocytophaga ochracea, and a. actinomycetemcomitans at suppurating sites and for f. nucleatum at non-suppurating sites.

TI  == longitudinal monitoring of humoral antibody in subjects with destructive periodontal diseases.
AB  == fifty-one subjects (16-61 years old) with evidence of prior destructive periodontal disease were monitored clinically and immunologically at bi-monthly intervals for up to 5 yr. periodontal disease activity, determined as new attachment loss, was detected in 33 of these subjects. only 4 of 51 subjects failed to show an elevated serum antibody level to any of the 18 subgingival species tested. the antibody level threshold established for periodontally healthy subjects was exceeded most often in diseased subjects with serum antibody to actinobacillus sp., p. gingivalis, e. corrodens, c. concisus, f. nucleatum and p. intermedia in that order. in general, most serum antibody levels to subgingival species remained relatively consistent for periods as long as 5 yr. however, major increases and decreases in antibody could be detected to at most one or two species in individual subjects. in addition, prolonged, steady increases and decreases in antibody to specific species could be detected in certain subjects. these findings suggest that major changes occurring in serum antibody may reflect fluctuations in the nature of the infection. differences were observed in the antibody level to specific species when subjects were divided into subsets on the basis of clinical criteria. these included high levels of antibody to a. actinomycetemcomitans y4 in ljp and rpp subjects and to  a. actinomycetemcomitans 29523 in ljp and gjp subjects.
