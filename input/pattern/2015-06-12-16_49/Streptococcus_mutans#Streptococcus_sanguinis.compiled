TI  - A study of the fluorescence characteristics of common cariogenic microorganisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the fluorescence characteristics of common cariogenic bacteria: Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus, Prevotella intermedia, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Candida albicans. METHODS: The bacteria were cultured on brain heart infusion (BHI) agar and BHI blood agar, and bacterial colonies were collected for further amplification in liquid medium. Bacterial suspensions in physiological saline were equally divided into three parts for bacteria counting, fluorescence spectrometry detection, and fluorescence microscope examination. RESULTS: The optimal excitation wavelength of the bacteria was 350 nm; their characteristic fluorescence peak position was at 436 +/- 4 nm. There was a significant linear correlation between fluorescence intensity and bacterial concentration. The mean optical density (MOD) of S. mutans and L. acidophilus cultivated in BHI blood was significantly higher than that cultivated in BHI agar (110 +/- 10 vs. 57 +/- 20; 94 +/- 16 vs. 31 +/- 12, respectively, P < 0.05). The MOD of S. sanguis, A. viscosus, and P. intermedia cultivated in BHI blood agar was higher than that cultivated in BHI agar (37 +/- 12 vs. 36 +/- 11; 43 +/- 17 vs. 38 +/- 6; 86 +/- 21 vs. 72 +/- 8, respectively, P > 0.05); the opposite was observed for C. albicans. CONCLUSION: At 350 nm excitation wavelength, 436 +/- 4 nm is an indicator for detecting six cariogenic bacteria. The fluorescence energy, Q, is a valuable index reflecting bacterial concentration under fluorescence spectrometry detection. Exogenous fluorescence groups have greater influence on fluorescence intensity and little influence on fluorescence peak position detection.
TI  - [The microbiological aspects of orthodontic treatment of children with dental maxillary anomalies].
AB  - The issues of pre-nosologic diagnostic and effectiveness of treatment of diseases of oral cavity is an actual issue in dentistry. The long- duration orthodontic treatment of patients with dentoalveolar anomalies using non-removable devices is followed by such negative consequences as development demineralization of enamel and caries registered during treatment and after remove ofdevices. The level of quantitative content of oral streptococci was analyzed and dental status in children with dentoalveolar anomalies was evaluated during treatment with non-removable devices was evaluated. The caries and inflammation of periodontium of oral cavity were most often detected in children with high level of content of streptococci. In different periods of study the firm tendency of increasing of concentration of Streptococcus mutans and S. sanguis of dental plaque of oral cavity is established. The established index indicators of dental status of patients testify intensity of caries damage, level of poor hygiene of oral cavity, development of average degree of severity of inflammation process of periodontium. The obtained results substantiate involvement ofstreptococci, associates of microbiota of dental plaque of oral cavity in children, in process of development of caries. The characteristics of micro-ecology of dental plaque to evaluate cariesgenic situation that can be used as a basis for constructing diagnostic algorithm under monitoring of patients with dentoalveolar anomalies with purpose of forthcoming planning and implementation of effective orthodontic treatment.

TI  - Antimicrobial efficacy of Acacia nilotica, Murraya koenigii L. Sprengel, Eucalyptus hybrid, and Psidium guajava on primary plaque colonizers: An in vitro comparison between hot and cold extraction process.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The potential drawbacks of the existing antiplaque agents call for innovative strategies that are safe, effective, and easily available. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess and compare antimicrobial efficacy of four plant extracts derived using hot and cold extraction methods against Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus salivarius. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The leaves of Acacia nilotica, P. guajava, Eucalyptus hybrid, and Murraya konigii L. Sprengel were collected from the surrounding areas, identified and authenticated by a taxonomist. The leaves were washed, shade-dried, and hand crushed to obtain coarse powder. This was subsequently ground into a fine powder and extracted using ethanol by cold infusion and hot extraction process. The antimicrobial efficacy testing was done on American Type Culture Collection strains of S. mutans, S. sanguis, and S. salivarius using agar well diffusion method. 0.2% chlorhexidine and dimethyl sulfoxide were used as positive and negative controls. The mean inhibition zone using 10% concentration of these extracts was compared using independent sample t-test and one-way analysis of variance. RESULTS: All the four plant extracts inhibited the growth of S. mutans, S. sanguis, and S. salivarius irrespective of the method of extraction. The extracts of A. nilotica, P. guajava, and E. hybrid derived from both the methods of extraction exhibited a significantly higher inhibition zone against S. mutans in comparison with Murraya koenigii L. Sprengel and chlorhexidine. The cold extracts of A. nilotica and E. hybrid exhibited higher zone of inhibition against S. sanguis while the hot extracts of M. koenigii L. Sprengel exhibited a higher zone of inhibition against S. mutans. CONCLUSION: All the four plant extracts derived using either hot or cold extraction were effective against these bacteria and have the potential to be used as antiplaque agents.
TI  - Inhibitory effects of antiseptic mouthrinses on Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis and Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oral antiseptics are valuable in controlling oral infections caused by cariogenic bacteria. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of mouthrinses and pure antiseptic compounds on Streptococcus mutans and non-mutans bacteria (Streptococcus sanguinis and Lactobacillus acidophilus). METHODS: The agar diffusion assay was employed to determine bacterial growth inhibition. RESULTS: Commercial mouthrinses containing chlorhexidine gluconate (0.2%), cetylpyridinium chloride (0.05%) and sodium fluoride (0.05%) produced statistically similar growth inhibition of S. mutans, S. sanguinis and L. acidophilus (with zones of inhibition ranging from 7.56 +/- 0.52 mm to 7.39 +/- 0.53 mm, 17.44 +/- 0.94 mm to 18.31 +/- 0.62 mm and 8.61 +/- 1.43 to 8.67 +/- 1.43 mm respectively, p > 0.05). The chlorhexidine mouthwash produced the greatest mean growth inhibition of S. sanguinis and S. mutans compared to all other mouthrinses tested (p < 0.01). The minimum concentrations at which inhibition against S. mutans could be detected were chlorhexidine gluconate at 0.005% (wt/vol), cetylpyridinium chloride 0.01% (wt/ vol), povidone iodine 10% (wt/vol) and sodium hypochlorite 0.5% (vol/vol). CONCLUSIONS: Chlorhexidine (0.01%), cetylpyridinium chloride (0.01%), povidone iodine (10%) and sodium hypochlorite (0.5%) are effective at inhibiting the growth of S. mutans, S. sanguinis and L. acidophilus.
TI  - Platelet activation is a key event in the pathogenesis of streptococcal infections.
AB  - Diverse Streptococcus species including Streptococcus Pneumoniae, Sanguis, Gordonii, Mitis and Mutans cause life-threatening conditions including pneumonia, bacteremia and meningitis. These diseases bear a high morbidity and mortality and for this reason, understanding the key events in the pathogenesis of these infections have a great significance in their prevention and/or treatment. Here, we describe as how the activation of the platelets and their affinity to bind to bacterial proteins act as early key events in the pathogenesis of Streptococcal infections.
TI  - [The effect of fluoride on adhesion of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis on the dental pure titanium surface].
AB  - PURPOSE: This study was to investigate the effect of fluoride on adhesion of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis on the dental pure titanium surface. METHODS: The adhesion of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis on the dental pure titanium surface were examined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay after soaked in artificial saliva containing different concentrations of sodium fluoride for 24 h. Then the surface roughness and surface morphology of the pure titanium were analyzed by atomic force microscope after bacterial adhesion experiments. The data was statistically analyzed by analysis of variance(ANOVA) with SPSS11.0 software package. RESULTS: After soaked in artificial saliva containing different concentrations of sodium fluoride for 24 h, the sequence of OD values showed the adhesion of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis on dental pure titanium surface was 0 g/L < 0.5 g/L < 1.0g/L < 2.0 g/L (P<0.05). In addition, the sequence of Ra values showed the surface roughness of pure titanium after bacterial adhesion experiments was 0 g/L < 0.5 g/L < 1.0g/L < 2.0 g/L (P<0.05). And the surface morphology of pure titanium was consistent with the changes of OD value and Ra value. CONCLUSIONS: The results of adhesion of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis, surface roughness and surface morphology reveal that fluoride aggravates the corrosion of pure titanium, increases the surface roughness, and thus promots the adhesion of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis on the titanium surface.

TI  - Antimicrobial Activity of Chemokine CXCL10 for Dermal and Oral Microorganisms.
AB  - CXCL10 (IP-10) is a small 10 kDa chemokine with antimicrobial activity. It is induced by IFN-gamma, chemoattracts mononuclear cells, and promotes adhesion of T cells. Recently, we detected CXCL10 on the surface of the skin and in the oral cavity. In the current study, we used broth microdilution and radial diffusion assays to show that CXCL10 inhibits the growth of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Corynebacterium jeikeium, Corynebacterium striatum, and Candida albicans HMV4C, but not Corynebacterium bovis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Poryphromonas gingivalis, or C. albicans ATCC 64124. The reason for the selective antimicrobial activity is not yet known. However, antimicrobial activity of CXCL10 may be related to its composition and structure, as a cationic 98 amino acid residue molecule with 10 lysine residues, 7 arginine residues, a total net charge of +11, and a theoretical pI of 9.93. Modeling studies revealed that CXCL10 contains an alpha-helix at the N-terminal, three anti-parallel beta-strands in the middle, and an alpha-helix at the C-terminal. Thus, CXCL10, when produced on the surface of the skin or in the oral cavity, likely has antimicrobial activity and may enhance innate antimicrobial and cellular responses to the presence of select commensal or opportunistic microorganisms.
TI  - Biological and chemical-physical properties of root-end filling materials: A comparative study.
AB  - AIM: The purpose of the study is to evaluate and compare the biological and chemical-physical properties of four different root-end filling materials. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cytotoxicity towards murine odontoblasts cells (MDPC-23) was evaluated using the Transwell insert methodology by Alamar blue test. Streptococcus salivarius, S. sanguis, and S. mutans strains were selected to evaluate the antimicrobial activity by agar disc diffusion test. Solubility was determined after 24 h and 2 months. pH values were measured after 3 and 24 h. To evaluate radiopacity, all materials were scanned on a GE Healthcare Lunar Prodigy. RESULTS: Excellent percentage of vitality were obtained by mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA)-based materials and Biodentine. MTA-Angelus, ProRoot MTA, and Intermediate Restorative Material (IRM) showed the highest values for the inhibition zones when tested for S. mutans, while Biodentine showed the largest inhibition zone when tested for S. sanguis. All the materials fulfilled the requirements of the International Standard 6876, demonstrating low solubility with a weight loss of less than 3%. No significant reduction in pH value was demonstrated after 24 h. ProRoot MTA and MTA-Angelus showed the highest values of radiographic density. CONCLUSIONS: The differences showed by the root-end filling materials tested do not cover completely the ideal clinical requests.
TI  - Comparison of the Antibacterial Properties of Three Mouthwashes Containing Chlorhexidine Against Oral Microbial Plaques: An in vitro Study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The mouth provides an environment that allows the colonization and growth of a wide variety of microorganisms, especially bacteria. One of the most effective ways to reduce oral microorganisms is using mouthwashes. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the antibacterial effects of chlorhexidine mouthwashes (manufacture by Livar, Behsa, Boht) on common oral microorganisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this in vitro study, isolated colonies of four bacteria, including Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguinis, S. salivarius and Lactobacillus casei, were prepared for an antimicrobial mouth rinse test. The tube dilution method was used for determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC). RESULTS: The MICs for Kin gingival, Behsa and Boht mouthwashes were 0.14, 0.48 and 1000 micrograms/mL using the tube method for S. mutans, respectively. The MBCs for the mentioned mouthwashes were 0.23, 1.9 and 2000 micrograms/mL for S. mutans, respectively. The MICs for Kin gingival, Behsa and Boht mouthwashes were 0.073, 0.48 and 250 micrograms/mL using the tube method for S. sanguinis, respectively. The MBCs for the mentioned mouthwashes were 0.14, 1.9 and 1000 micrograms/mL for S. sanguinis, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The Kin Gingival chlorhexidine mouthwash has a greater effect than Behsa and Boht mouthwashes on oral microorganisms and is recommended to be used for plaque chemical inhibition.
TI  - Proteome analysis identifies the Dpr protein of Streptococcus mutans as an important factor in the presence of early streptococcal colonizers of tooth surfaces.
AB  - Oral streptococci are primary colonizers of tooth surfaces and Streptococcus mutans is the principal causative agent of dental caries in humans. A number of proteins are involved in the formation of monospecies biofilms by S. mutans. This study analyzed the protein expression profiles of S. mutans biofilms formed in the presence or absence of S. gordonii, a pioneer colonizer of the tooth surface, by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). After identifying S. mutans proteins by Mass spectrometric analysis, their expression in the presence of S. gordonii was analyzed. S. mutans was inoculated with or without S. gordonii DL1. The two species were compartmentalized using 0.2-mul Anopore membranes. The biofilms on polystyrene plates were harvested, and the solubilized proteins were separated by 2-DE. When S. mutans biofilms were formed in the presence of S. gordonii, the peroxide resistance protein Dpr of the former showed 4.3-fold increased expression compared to biofilms that developed in the absence of the pioneer colonizer. In addition, we performed a competition assay using S. mutans antioxidant protein mutants together with S. gordonii and other initial colonizers. Growth of the dpr-knockout S. mutans mutant was significantly inhibited by S. gordonii, as well as by S. sanguinis. Furthermore, a cell viability assay revealed that the viability of the dpr-defective mutant was significantly attenuated compared to the wild-type strain when co-cultured with S. gordonii. Therefore, these results suggest that Dpr might be one of the essential proteins for S. mutans survival on teeth in the presence of early colonizing oral streptococci.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of apitoxin, melittin and phospholipase A(2) of honey bee  (Apis mellifera) venom against oral pathogens.
AB  - In this work, we used the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) technique to evaluate the antibacterial potential of the apitoxin produced by Apis mellifera bees against the causative agents of tooth decay. Apitoxin was assayed in natura and in the commercially available form. The antibacterial actions of the main components of this apitoxin, phospholipase A2, and melittin were also assessed, alone and in combination. The following bacteria were tested: Streptococcus salivarius, S. sobrinus, S. mutans, S. mitis, S. sanguinis, Lactobacillus casei, and Enterococcus faecalis. The MIC results obtained for the commercially available apitoxin and for the apitoxin in natura were close and lay between 20 and 40 microg / mL, which indicated good antibacterial activity. Melittin was the most active component in apitoxin; it displayed very promising MIC values, from 4 to 40 microg / mL. Phospholipase A2 presented MIC values higher than 400 microg / mL. Association of mellitin with phospholipase A2 yielded MIC values ranging between 6 and 80 microg / mL. Considering that tooth decay affects people's health, apitoxin and its component melittin have potential application against oral pathogens.
TI  - Effect of Rhus coriaria L. water extract on five common oral bacteria and bacterial biofilm formation on orthodontic wire.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Recently, use of herbal medicine and plant extracts as a substitute for commercially available chemical drugs for control of infectious diseases such as dental caries and periodontal disease has become increasingly popular. The present study was aimed to evaluate the effect of Rhus coriaria L. water extract on five common oral bacteria and bacterial biofilm formation on orthodontic wire. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For primary assessment of the antibacterial properties of Rhus coriaria L. water extract, the well-plate method in BHIA (Brain Heart Infusion Agar, Merck, Germany) medium was used Using macrodilution method, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of the extract against each microorganism were determined. The effect of Rhus coriaria L. on bacterial biofilm formation on orthodontic wire was assessed using viable cell count in biofilm medium (BM) containing 3% sucrose. In the final phase, after fixation of samples in alcohol and glutaraldehyde, samples were prepared for SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) analysis. RESULTS: The diameter of the zone of growth inhibition was proportionate to the tested concentrations of the extract. The lowest MIC (0.390 mg/ml) and MBC (1.5 mg/ml ) of the Rhus coriaria L. were found to be against Streptococcus sobrinus ATCC 27607. Rhus coriaria L. water extract decreased bacterial biofilm formation on orthodontic wire at MIC and 1/8 of MIC by S. sanguinis ATCC 10556, S. sobrinus ATCC 27607, S. salivarius ATCC 9222, S. mutans ATCC 35608 and E. faecalis CIP 55142 by24.2%-43%, 68.5%-91.6%, 10.6%-79.1%, 22.2%-86.1% and 40.6%-76.4%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Based on the results, Rhus coriaria L. water extract had significant antibacterial properties against five common oral bacteria and was able to inhibit bacterial biofilm formation on orthodontic wire. Further investigations are recommended for widespread clinical use of this extract.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of berry juices, an in vitro study.
AB  - Abstract Objective. The aim of the present study was to evaluate in vitro antibacterial activities of blackcurrant and sea buckthorn juices on bacteria associated with gingival inflammation. Materials and methods. The growth of selected bacteria (Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus gordonii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) was studied in vitro on agar plates. The content of phenols in the different extracts was measured with HPLC-ESI-MS. Results. The spectrometric analysis identified that the highest level of the single phenols studied was found for ferulic acid (113 mug/ml) in blackcurrant juice. Sea buckthorn contained low levels of selected phenols. Total bacterial inhibition for all bacterial species studied was found at 20% berry juice concentration with pH varying between 4.1-5.4. Conclusions. The present study identified that in vitro bacterial growth on agar plates was inhibited by blackcurrant and sea buckthorn juices and that low juice pH explains bacterial in vitro growth. This may have clinical implications in biofilm development, reducing the risks for both tooth decay and gingivitis.
TI  - Effect of antibacterial dental adhesive on multispecies biofilms formation.
AB  - Antibacterial adhesives have favorable prospects to inhibit biofilms and secondary caries. The objectives of this study were to investigate the antibacterial effect of dental adhesives containing dimethylaminododecyl methacrylate (DMADDM) on different bacteria in controlled multispecies biofilms and its regulating effect on development of biofilm for the first time. Antibacterial material was synthesized, and Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus gordonii, and Streptococcus sanguinis were chosen to form multispecies biofilms. Lactic acid assay and pH measurement were conducted to study the acid production of controlled multispecies biofilms. Anthrone method and exopolysaccharide (EPS):bacteria volume ratio measured by confocal laser scanning microscopy were performed to determine the EPS production of biofilms. The colony-forming unit counts, scanning electron microscope imaging, and dead:live volume ratio decided by confocal laser scanning microscopy were used to study the biomass change of controlled multispecies biofilms. The TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction and fluorescent in situ hybridization imaging were used to study the proportion change in multispecies biofilms of different groups. The results showed that DMADDM-containing adhesive groups slowed the pH drop and decreased the lactic acid production noticeably, especially lactic acid production in the 5% DMADDM group, which decreased 10- to 30-fold compared with control group (P < 0.05). EPS was reduced significantly in 5% DMADDM group (P < 0.05). The DMADDM groups reduced the colony-forming unit counts significantly (P < 0.05) and had higher dead:live volume ratio in biofilms compared with control group (P < 0.05). The proportion of S. mutans decreased steadily in DMADDM-containing groups and continually increased in control group, and the biofilm had a more healthy development tendency after the regulation of DMADDM. In conclusion, the adhesives containing DMADDM had remarkable antimicrobial properties to serve as "bioactive" adhesive materials and revealed its potential value for antibiofilm and anticaries clinical applications.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of synthetic antimicrobial decapeptide against oral bacteria].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of decapeptide, a novel antimicrobial peptide, against several major cariogenic and periodontopathogenic bacteria in vitro. METHODS In this study, we investigated the antimicrobial activity of decapeptide against Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans), Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus gordonii, Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces naeslundii, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Saccharomyces albicans in vitro using the agar diffusion method and broth dilution method. Furthermore, a time-kill kinetic study of decapeptide against S. mutans was performed. RESULTS: The results showed that decapeptide exhibited antimicrobial activity against various oral bacteria and fungi. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of main cariogenic bacteria ranged from 62.5 mug . mL(-1) to 125 mug . mL(-1), and the MIC of periodontopathogenic bacteria tested ranged from 250 mug . mL(-1) to 1,000 mug . mL(-1). Among the bacteria tested, decapeptide had a strong inhibitory effect on cariogenic S. mutans. Results of the time-kill kinetic studies showed that decapeptide reduced the viable counts of S. mutans by more than one order of magnitude after 20 min of incubation, and thoroughly killed S. mutans after 30 min. No viable cells could be detected after 24 h of incubation. CONCLUSION: This study suggest that decapeptide might have potential clinical application in treating dental caries by killing S. mutans within dental plaque.
TI  - Comparison of species identification of endocarditis associated viridans streptococci using rnpB genotyping and 2 MALDI-TOF systems.
AB  - Streptococcus spp. are important causes of infective endocarditis but challenging in species identification. This study compared identification based on sequence determination of the rnpB gene with 2 systems of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, MALDI Biotyper (Bruker) and VITEK MS IVD (bioMerieux). Blood culture isolates of viridans streptococci from 63 patients with infective endocarditis were tested. The 3 methods showed full agreement for all 36 isolates identified in the Anginosus, Bovis, and Mutans groups or identified as Streptococcus cristatus, Streptococcus gordonii, or Streptococcus sanguinis. None of the methods could reliably identify the 23 isolates to the species level when designated as Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, or Streptococcus tigurinus. In 7 isolates classified to the Mitis group, the rnpB sequences deviated strikingly from all reference sequences, and additional analysis of sodA and groEL genes indicated the occurrence of yet unidentified Streptococcus spp.
TI  - Combinatorial effects of arginine and fluoride on oral bacteria.
AB  - Dental caries is closely associated with the microbial disequilibrium between acidogenic/aciduric pathogens and alkali-generating commensal residents within the dental plaque. Fluoride is a widely used anticaries agent, which promotes tooth hard-tissue remineralization and suppresses bacterial activities. Recent clinical trials have shown that oral hygiene products containing both fluoride and arginine possess a greater anticaries effect compared with those containing fluoride alone, indicating synergy between fluoride and arginine in caries management. Here, we hypothesize that arginine may augment the ecological benefit of fluoride by enriching alkali-generating bacteria in the plaque biofilm and thus synergizes with fluoride in controlling dental caries. Specifically, we assessed the combinatory effects of NaF/arginine on planktonic and biofilm cultures of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Porphyromonas gingivalis with checkerboard microdilution assays. The optimal NaF/arginine combinations were selected, and their combinatory effects on microbial composition were further examined in single-, dual-, and 3-species biofilm using bacterial species-specific fluorescence in situ hybridization and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. We found that arginine synergized with fluoride in suppressing acidogenic S. mutans in both planktonic and biofilm cultures. In addition, the NaF/arginine combination synergistically reduced S. mutans but enriched S. sanguinis within the multispecies biofilms. More importantly, the optimal combination of NaF/arginine maintained a "streptococcal pressure" against the potential growth of oral anaerobe P. gingivalis within the alkalized biofilm. Taken together, we conclude that the combinatory application of fluoride and arginine has a potential synergistic effect in maintaining a healthy oral microbial equilibrium and thus represents a promising ecological approach to caries management.
TI  - Correlation of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguinis colonization and  ex vivo hydrogen peroxide production in carious lesion-free and high caries adults.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to estimate oral colonization by Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguinis in adults with high and without any caries experience. Furthermore, differences in the amount of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) produced by S. sanguinis isolated from both groups were assessed. DESIGN: Forty adults were divided into: (i) carious lesion-free, without any carious lesion, assessed by the International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS), or restoration, (CF) and (ii) high caries experience (HC). Saliva samples were collected and seeded on respective agar-plates for enumeration of total streptococci, S. mutans and S. sanguinis (CFU/mL) and compared between groups. Additionally, S. sanguinis colonies obtained from both groups were inoculated on Prussian blue agar for H2O2 detection. Production of H2O2 was quantified and compared between the two groups. S. sanguinis counts were significantly higher in CF than HC individuals (p<0.05). Conversely, S. mutans showed significantly higher levels in HC than CF subjects (p<0.001). S. sanguinis colonies from CF individuals produced significantly larger H2O2 halos compared with HC subjects. CONCLUSIONS: S. sanguinis predominates over S. mutans in saliva of adults without caries experience. In those people, S. sanguinis produces more H2O2ex vivo.
TI  - Inhibitory effects of children's toothpastes on Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis and Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - AIM: As suppression of Streptococcus mutans in young children may prevent or delay colonisation of the oral cavity, toothbrushing with dentifrices containing anti-S. mutans activity may aid in preventing caries. The aims of this study were to compare the effects of children's dentifrices on the growth of S. mutans and non-mutans bacteria (Streptococcus sanguinis and Lactobacillus acidophilus). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The agar diffusion assay at neutral pH was used to examine the antibacterial activity of commercial dentifrices and their major constituents. RESULTS: Dentifrices containing 1,450 ppm fluoride produced greater growth inhibition of both S. mutans and S. sanguinis than those with <500 ppm. No inhibition was seen for pure solutions of sodium fluoride or sodium monofluorophosphate at fluoride concentrations up to 100,000 ppm. Stannous fluoride exerted antibacterial effects at concentrations above 10,000 ppm. Significant growth inhibition of both S. mutans and S. sanguinis was seen with sodium lauryl sulphate at 2,500 ppm and with triclosan at 100 ppm. No inhibitory effects were seen for xylitol, sorbitol, sodium pyrophosphate or polyethylene glycol at concentrations up to 80,000 ppm. CONCLUSION: Sodium lauryl sulphate is the major bacterial inhibitory compound in children's dentifrices.
TI  - Antimicrobial efficacy of the combinations of Acacia nilotica, Murraya koenigii L. sprengel, Eucalyptus hybrid and Psidium guajava on primary plaque colonizers.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is an urgent need for innovative strategies to combat the two most common dental diseases of mankind namely dental caries and periodontitis. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to assess the antimicrobial efficacy of the double combinations of Acacia nilotica (AN), Murraya koenigii L. Sprengel (MKL), Eucalyptus hybrid and Psidium guajava on primary plaque colonizers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The plant extracts of AN, MKL. Sprengel, Eucalyptus hybrid and P. guajava were prepared using Soxhlet apparatus. The stock solutions of individual plant extracts (100 mg/ml) were prepared. Equal quantities of stock solutions were mixed to obtain six double combinations of herbal extracts. The antimicrobial efficacy testing was done against three primary plaque colonizers using agar well-diffusion method. 0.2% chlorhexidine and dimethyl sulfoxide were used as positive and as negative controls. The mean inhibition zone between the categories was compared using one-way Analysis of Variance and Tukey's post hoc test. RESULTS: The combination of AN and P. guajava produced the highest mean diameter of inhibition zone (21.08 mm +/- 2.11) against Streptococcus mutans. The chlorhexidine produced the least inhibition zone against S. mutans (14.50 +/- 2.07). The combination of AN and P. guajava produced the maximum antimicrobial efficacy against Streptococcus sanguis (19.67 +/- 1.03) and Streptococcus salivarius (20.33 +/- 1.86). CONCLUSION: All the combinations of plant extracts have the potential to be used as antiplaque and anticaries agents. The combinations of herbal extracts offer enhanced antimicrobial efficacy due to the synergistic effects besides slowing the development of resistance.
TI  - Salivary antibody response to streptococci in preterm and fullterm children: a prospective study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Secretory immunoglobulins present in mucosa surfaces represent the first line of defense of the adaptive immune system against infectious challenges. Preterm (PT) neonates' humoral immunity is diminished compared to full-term (FT) newborns. The identification of important antigens (Ags) of virulence of oral species may help in the investigation of the mechanisms of antigenic stimulation and the development of the mucosal immune response. In the present study, we measured saliva levels of immunoglobulins A (IgA) and M (IgM) and characterized the specificity of IgA against Ags of several streptococcal species found early in life. METHODS: This was a prospective observational study. Salivary IgA (sIgA) antibody responses to bacterial species that are prototypes of pioneer (Streptococcus mitis, S. sanguinis, S. gordonii) and pathogenic (Streptococcus mutans) microorganisms of the oral cavity were studied in FT and PT children in two visits: at birth (T0) and at 3 months of age (T3). Salivas from 123 infants (72 FT and 51 PT) were collected during the first 10h after birth (T0) and again at 3 months of age (T3). Salivary levels of IgA and IgM antibodies were analysed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A subgroup of 26 FT and 24 PT children were compared with respect to patterns of antibody specificities against different streptococci Ags using Western blot assays. RESULTS: No significant differences (P>0.05) in salivary levels of IgA and IgM between FT and PT babies were found at birth. At T3, mean sIgA values were similar between groups and sIgM levels were significantly higher in PT than FT (P<0.05). Western blot assays identified positive IgA response to streptococci in the majority of children, especially in the FT group. There were some differences between groups in relation to the frequency of children with positive response to Ags and intensity of IgA response. In general, oral streptococci Ags were more frequently detected and bands were more intense in FT than in PT, especially in T3. Prospective analysis of patterns of sIgA against Ags of different streptococcal species revealed an increase in complexity of the sIgA antibody response from the first day of birth (T0) to T3 in PT and FT. CONCLUSION: The patterns of sIgA response to streptococci Ags appear to be influenced by the gestational age, which might reflect the level of immunological maturity of the mucosal immune system.
TI  - Levels and complexity of IgA antibody against oral bacteria in samples of human colostrum.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans (SM) have three main virulence antigens: glucan binding protein B (gbpB), glucosyltransferase (Gtf) and antigens I/II (Ag I/II) envolved in the capacity of those bacteria to adhere and accumulate in the dental biofilm. Also, the glycosyltransferases 153 kDa of Streptococcus gordonii (SGO) and 170kDa of Streptococcus sanguinis (SSA) were important antigens associated with the accumulation of those bacterias. Streptococcus mitis (SMI) present IgA1 protease of 202 kDa. We investigated the specificity and levels IgA against those antigens of virulence in samples of human colostrum. This study involved 77 samples of colostrum that were analyzed for levels of immunoglobulian A, M and G by Elisa. The specificity of IgA against extracts of SM and initials colonizators (SSA, SMI, SGO) were analyzed by the Western blot. The mean concentration of IgA was 2850.2 (+/-2567.2) mg/100 mL followed by IgM and IgG (respectively 321.8+/-90.3 and 88.3+/-51.5), statistically different (p<0.05). Results showed that the majority of samples had detectable levels of IgA antibodies to extracts of bacteria antigens and theirs virulence antigens. To SM, the GbpB was significantly lower detected than others antigens of SM (p<0.05). High complexities of response to Ags were identified in the samples. There were no significant differences in the mean number of IgA-reactive Ags between the antigens (p>0.4). So, the breast milk from first hours after birth presented significant levels of IgA specific against important virulence of antigens those oral streptococci, which can disrupt the installation and accumulation process of these microorganisms in the oral cavity.
TI  - Antibacterial efficacy of exogenous nitric oxide on periodontal pathogens.
AB  - Current treatments for periodontitis (e.g., scaling/root planing and chlorhexidine) have limited efficacy since they fail to suppress microbial biofilms satisfactorily over time, and the use of adjunctive antimicrobials can promote the emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms. Herein, we report the novel application of nitric oxide (NO)-releasing scaffolds (i.e., dendrimers and silica particles) as anti-periodontopathogenic agents. The effectiveness of macromolecular NO release was demonstrated by a 3-log reduction in periodontopathogenic Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis viability. In contrast, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguinis, caries-associated organisms, were substantially less sensitive to NO treatment. Both dendrimer- and silica-based NO release exhibited substantially less toxicity to human gingival fibroblasts at concentrations necessary to eradicate periodontopathogens than did clinical concentrations of chlorhexidine. These results suggest the potential utility of macromolecular NO-release scaffolds as a novel platform for the development of periodontal disease therapeutics.
TI  - In-office bleaching gel with 35% hydrogen peroxide enhanced biofilm formation of  early colonizing streptococci on human enamel.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the effects of 25% and 35% hydrogen peroxide in-office bleaching systems on surface roughness and streptococcal biofilm formation on human enamel. METHODS: Enamel specimens (3mmx3mmx2mm, n=162) from human permanent teeth were randomly divided into 3 treatment groups (n=54 each): (1) control, (2) bleached with 25% hydrogen peroxide (Zoom2), and (3) bleached with 35% hydrogen peroxide (Beyond). The enamel surface roughness was measured by a profilometer before and after treatments. Subsequently, the treated enamel specimens were randomly placed into 3 subgroups (n=18 each) and incubated with: (1) trypticase soy broth control, (2) Streptococcus mutans culture and (3) Streptococcus sanguinis culture for 24h. Biofilm formation was quantified by crystal violet staining. The biofilm structure on three specimens from each group was visualized by scanning electron microscopy. Data were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests with Bonferroni corrections. Significance level was set at p<0.05. RESULTS: Both bleaching systems significantly reduced enamel surface roughness comparing to the control group (p<0.001), but there was no difference between the two treatment groups. Remarkably, S. sanguinis biofilm formation was significantly higher on enamel specimens bleached with 35% hydrogen peroxide than other treatments (p<0.001), but was lower on those bleached with 25% hydrogen peroxide (p<0.001). In contrast, no difference in S. mutans biofilm formation was observed among the three treatment groups. CONCLUSION: Both 25% and 35% hydrogen peroxide caused similar degrees of reduction in enamel surface roughness. Nevertheless, bleaching with 35% hydrogen peroxide appeared to markedly promote S. sanguinis biofilm formation. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The increase of early colonizer biofilm raised concerns over adverse effects of in-office bleaching on plaque formation. This should be further investigated in vivo and efficient plaque control should be emphasized after bleaching with high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide.
TI  - Effects of simulated microgravity on Streptococcus mutans physiology and biofilm  structure.
AB  - Long-term spaceflights will eventually become an inevitable occurrence. Previous  studies have indicated that oral infectious diseases, including dental caries, were more prevalent in astronauts due to the effect of microgravity. However, the impact of the space environment, especially the microgravity environment, on the virulence factors of Streptococcus mutans, a major caries-associated bacterium, is yet to be explored. In the present study, we investigated the impact of simulated microgravity on the physiology and biofilm structure of S. mutans. We also explored the dual-species interaction between S. mutans and Streptococcus sanguinis under a simulated microgravity condition. Results indicated that the simulated microgravity condition can enhance the acid tolerance ability, modify the biofilm architecture and extracellular polysaccharide distribution of S. mutans, and increase the proportion of S. mutans within a dual-species biofilm, probably through the regulation of various gene expressions. We hypothesize that the enhanced competitiveness of S. mutans under simulated microgravity may cause a multispecies micro-ecological imbalance, which would result in the initiation of dental caries. Our current findings are consistent with previous studies, which revealed a higher astronaut-associated incidence of caries. Further research is required to explore the detailed mechanisms.
TI  - S-aryl-L-cysteine sulphoxides and related organosulphur compounds alter oral biofilm development and AI-2-based cell-cell communication.
AB  - AIMS: To design and synthesize a library of structurally related, small molecules related to homologues of compounds produced by the plant Petiveria alliacea and determine their ability to interfere with AI-2 cell-cell communication and biofilm formation by oral bacteria. Many human diseases are associated with persistent bacterial biofilms. Oral biofilms (dental plaque) are problematic as they are often associated with tooth decay, periodontal disease and systemic disorders such as heart disease and diabetes. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a microplate-based approach, a bio-inspired small molecule library was screened for anti-biofilm activity against the oral species Streptococcus mutans UA159, Streptococcus sanguis 10556 and Actinomyces oris MG1. To complement the static screen, a flow-based BioFlux microfluidic system screen was also performed under conditions representative of the human oral cavity. Several compounds were found to display biofilm inhibitory activity in all three of the oral bacteria tested. These compounds were also shown to inhibit bioluminescence by Vibrio harveyi and were thus inferred to be quorum sensing (QS) inhibitors. CONCLUSION: Due to the structural similarity of these compounds to each other, and to key molecules in AI-2 biosynthetic pathways, we propose that these molecules potentially reduce biofilm formation via antagonism of QS or QS-related pathways. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study highlights the potential for a non-antimicrobial-based strategy, focused on AI-2 cell-cell signalling, to control the development of dental plaque. Considering that many bacterial species use AI-2 cell-cell signalling, as well as the increased concern of the use of antimicrobials in healthcare products, such an anti-biofilm approach could also be used to control biofilms in environments beyond the human oral cavity.
TI  - Influence of time, toothpaste and saliva in the retention of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguinis on different toothbrushes.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The intraoral transmission of cariogenic and periodontopathogenic species seems to be facilitated by contaminated toothbrushes and other oral hygiene devices. The aim of this investigation was to analyze the in vitro retention and survival rate of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguinis on different toothbrushes. The impacts of human saliva and antimicrobial toothpaste on these parameters were further evaluated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Part I: Four toothbrushes (Colgate 360 degrees , Curaprox CS5460 ultra soft, elmex InterX, Trisa Flexible Head3) were contaminated by S. mutans DSM 20523 or S. sanguinis DSM 20068 suspensions for three minutes. Bacteria were removed from the toothbrushes after either three minutes (T0) or 24 hours (T24) of dry storage and grown on Columbia blood agar plates for the quantification of colony-forming units (CFUs). Part II: The effects of saliva from a caries-active or a caries-inactive person and of toothpaste containing 0.12% chlorhexidine digluconate were also tested. RESULTS: Part I: After three minutes of dry storage, approximately one percent of the bacteria were still detectable on the toothbrushes. After 24 hours, S. sanguinis exhibited a more pronounced decrease in viable cell numbers compared with S. mutans but the differences were not significant (Kruskal-Wallis test, p>0.05). Part II: The addition of human saliva from a caries-active or caries-inactive person slightly increased the retention of both streptococcal species at T0. The use of toothpaste had no influence on the amount of viable streptococci at T0, but it reduced the microbial load after 24 hours of storage. There were only slight nonsignificant differences (p>0.05) between the four toothbrushes. CONCLUSIONS: In vitro bacterial retention and survival of S. sanguinis and S. mutans on different toothbrushes occurred. Within the limitations of this study, the use of human saliva or an antimicrobial toothpaste did not lead to significant differences in the microbial load on toothbrushes.
TI  - Susceptibility of methacrylate-based root canal filling to degradation by bacteria found in endodontic infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To present a case of endodontic failure obturated with a methacrylate-based root filling material, Resilon/RealSeal (RS). To determine if RS is susceptible to biodegradation by endodontically relevant microbes by a method known to show RS degradation. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Emulsions of RS were dispersed in agar with minimal bacterial nutrients in culture plates. Lipase PS served as a positive control. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were tested for their ability to biodegrade RS. The bacteria were inoculated in the plates and examined daily for RS degradation for 7 days. RESULTS: Degradation of the emulsified RS manifested in the formation of clear zones around P aeruginosa, P intermedia, P asaccharolytica, S aureus, and S epidermidis. No degradation was seen with the other tested bacteria or in plates that did not contain RS emulsion. CONCLUSION: Endodontic pathogenic bacteria can degrade RS. These findings complement other work and suggest that the seal and integrity of root canal fillings obturated with RS may be impaired by a microbial insult.
TI  - Cytocompatibility and antibacterial properties of capping materials.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the antimicrobial activity and  cytocompatibility of six different pulp-capping materials: Dycal (Dentsply), Calcicur (Voco), Calcimol LC (Voco), TheraCal LC (Bisco), MTA Angelus (Angelus), and Biodentine (Septodont). To evaluate antimicrobial activity, materials were challenged in vitro with Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, and Streptococcus sanguis in the agar disc diffusion test. Cytocompatibility of the assayed materials towards rat MDPC-23 cells was evaluated at different times by both MTT and apoptosis assays. Results significantly differed among the different materials tested. Both bacterial growth inhibition halos and cytocompatibility performances were significantly different among materials with different composition. MTA-based products showed lower cytotoxicity and valuable antibacterial activity, different from calcium hydroxide-based materials, which exhibited not only higher antibacterial activity but also higher cytotoxicity.
TI  - Propolis varnish: antimicrobial properties against cariogenic bacteria, cytotoxicity, and sustained-release profile.
AB  - Varnishes are preparations that differ in the polymeric matrix and therapeutical  agents. In dentistry they are used to prevent caries. In this study we developed a propolis varnish, considering propolis properties against cariogenic bacteria. To a chitosan polymeric base (CHV) was added ethanolic propolis extract in different concentrations: PV1 (5%), PV2 (10%), and PV3 (15%). Antimicrobial activity was carried out against Streptococcus mutans (SM), Streptococcus sanguinis (SG), Streptococcus salivarius (SS), and Lactobacillus casei (LC) through agar diffusion method. The three propolis concentrations incorporated were effective in inhibiting the growth of all microorganisms, but without significant difference between the zones of inhibition observed. Cytotoxicity assay was done by MTT method. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni test. None of the varnishes were cytotoxic, keeping 80% of viable cells, while CHV allowed cellular proliferation (120%). Sustained-release test was carried out by applying 40 mu L of each varnish in the buccal surface of bovine teeth and kept in an ethanol/water solution removed in regular times. According to the "independent model approach," the release profiles were distinct from each varnish and the most prolonged was PV3 (8 weeks). Varnish formulations had satisfactory antimicrobial activity against cariogenic bacteria and have a low cytotoxicity (<50%).
TI  - The influence of oral Veillonella species on biofilms formed by Streptococcus species.
AB  - Oral Veillonella, Veillonella atypica, Veillonella denticariosi, Veillonella dispar, Veillonella parvula, Veillonella rogosae, and Veillonella tobetsuensis are known as early colonizers in oral biofilm formation. To investigate the role of oral Veillonella, biofilms formed by the co-culture of Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, or Streptococcus sanguinis, with oral Veillonella were examined at the species level. The amount of biofilm formed by S. mutans, S. gordonii, and S. salivarius in the presence of the six Veillonella species was greater than that formed in the control experiments, with the exception of S. mutans with V. dispar. In contrast, in the case of biofilm formation by S. sanguinis, the presence of Veillonella species reduced the amount of the biofilm, with the exception of V. parvula and V. dispar. The time-dependent changes in the amount of biofilm and the number of planktonic cells were grouped into four patterns over the 24 combinations. Only that of S. gordonii with V. tobetsuensis showed a unique pattern. These results indicate that the mode of action of this combination differed from that of the other combinations with respect to biofilm formation. It is possible that there may be several factors involved in the interaction between Streptococcus and Veillonella species.
TI  - Antibacterial action of Chlorhexidine/thymol containing varnishes in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The antibacterial activity of two different formulations of a chlorhexidine/thymol varnish should be elucidated in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: The agar diffusion assay with Cervitec((R)) and CervitecPlus((R)) and three reference strains each of streptococci, lactobacilli, actinomyces and periodontal pathogens was performed. In a split-mouth study, 40 volunteers applied the test (CervitecPlus((R)), solvent water and ethanol) and control (Cervitec((R)), solvent ethyl acetate) varnish at buccal recessions of premolar teeth at baseline as well as after two, four and seven days. Supra- and subgingival plaques were collected 2 weeks before baseline and at the screening appointments. Supragingival plaque was analysed for mutans streptococci and lactobacilli and subgingival samples for Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Porphyromonas intermedia. Friedman/Wilcoxon tests and U-test were used for statistical analysis (P < 0.05). RESULTS: Most reference strains were susceptible with inhibition zones (mm) as follows: Cervitec((R))/CervitecPlus((R)) streptococci 27 +/- 1.7/21.3 +/- 2.5, lactobacilli 26 +/- 9.2/23.7 +/- 4.9, actinomyces 36.3 +/- 6.6/27.3 +/- 1.5, periodontal pathogens 18.7 +/- 7.6/18 +/- 1.7. Both varnishes reduced significantly the counts of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in the patients. However, no significant differences were found between test and control sides at any time. The total counts of periodontal pathogens were low. A tendency to higher counts of A. actinomycetemcomitans at the control side could be shown; the test side did not harbour significantly higher counts. CONCLUSION: Both varnishes may influence the plaque formation and reduce mutans streptococci in supragingival plaque.
TI  - The influence of a glucosyltransferase, encoded by gtfP, on biofilm formation by  Streptococcus sanguinis in a dual-species model.
AB  - Streptococcus sanguinis is an early colonizer of tooth surfaces and forms biofilms with other species of microorganisms. In vitro, S. sanguinis produces water-soluble glucans from sucrose and releases them into the culture supernatant; however, the role played by these glucans in biofilm formation is unclear. The present study examined both the effect of glucans on biofilm formation by S. sanguinis and the proportion of this bacterial species within the biofilms. Inactivation of the gtfP gene, annotated as glucosyltransferase in the S. sanguinis genome database, caused a marked reduction in the amount of water-soluble glucans in the culture supernatant, but not in the amount of water-insoluble glucans expressed on the bacterial cell surface. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that wild-type S. sanguinis, but not the gtfP-deficient mutant, produced large amounts of sticky material in the presence of 1% (w/v) sucrose. In addition, biofilm production by wild-type bacteria was greater than that by the mutant strain. By contrast, co-culture of mutant bacteria with Streptococcus mutans, S. sobrinus, S. oralis, S. gordonii, S. anginosus, or S. salivarius showed that inactivating the gtfP gene had little effect on the amount of biofilm produced. Furthermore, inactivating the gtfP gene did not greatly alter the proportion of S. sanguinis in the biofilms formed by the co-cultures. Thus, despite the role of S. sanguinis glucosyltransferase in formation of water-soluble glucans and biofilms in monoculture, the functional gene contributed little to biofilms in co-culture experiments.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of Iranian green-tea-containing mouthrinse vs chlorhexidine  0.2%: an in vitro study.
AB  - PURPOSE: Considering the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties of green tea, this study aimed to evaluate the antibacterial effect of mouthrinses containing green tea extract vs 0.2% chlorhexidine on selected microorganisms in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antibacterial activity of both mouthrinses and the pure green tea extract was assessed by using disk diffusion and the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) methods against five microorganisms: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aerogenosa and Escherichia coli. Growth inhibition zones were measured in mm after 24 h of incubation at 37 degrees C. The two mouthrinses were assessed at concentrations of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256 and 512 mg/ml to determine the MIC, which was interpreted as the lowest concentration of the agent that completely inhibited the growth of the test species. RESULTS: 0.2% chlorhexidine produced a larger zone of growth inhibition than did the mouthrinse made of green tea extract (P < 0.01). Paradoxically, the growth inhibition zones of the tested bacteria were significantly larger in pure extract of green tea than in 0.2% chlorhexidine (P < 0.01). The chlorhexidine mouthrinse inhibited the growth of all tested species and exhibited significantly lower MICs than did the green tea mouthrinse (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Even though the mouthrinse made with green tea extract presented an in vitro antimicrobial activity inferior to 0.2% chlorhexidine, the pure extract had considerable bactericidal effect.
TI  - Intensity and duration of in-vitro antibacterial activity of different adhesives  used in orthodontics.
AB  - This work investigated the antibacterial activity of 14 bonding agents to predict their ability to inhibit white-spot development during orthodontic treatment. Standardized, sterilized disks of each material were continuously rinsed (for up to 180 d) in a flow of sterile saline. At predetermined time points, the residual ability of each material to inhibit bacterial growth (determined by measuring the size of inhibition halos around disks placed onto appropriate culture media seeded with Streptococcus gordonii DSM6777, Streptococcus sanguinis DSM20567, Streptococcus mutans DSM20523, or Lactobacillus acidophilus DSM20079) and biofilm formation (determined by measuring the numbers of bacteria adherent to disks following incubation in appropriate broths) was tested in triplicate and compared with the baseline activities of freshly prepared materials. Overall antibacterial and anti-biofilm activities, adjusted for exposure time and strain of bacteria, were assessed. The decrease of antibacterial activity was faster (30-60 d) and complete for fluoride-enriched materials, but slower (90 d) and partial for antimicrobial-containing materials (benzalkonium chloride, zinc oxide, chlorexidine, or MDPB). Materials enriched with benzalkonium chloride, chlorexidine, or MDPB showed the highest antibacterial activities. Anti-biofilm assays yielded similar results. These data could be helpful for clinicians in the choice of the best performing bonding agent also in light of duration of the clinical application.
TI  - Adherence of Streptococcus sanguinis and Streptococcus mutans to saliva-coated S-PRG resin blocks.
AB  - This in vitro study performed elemental analysis of the ions absorbed into the salivary coat covering the surfaces of S-PRG resin blocks and assessed the adherence of Streptococcus sanguinis and Streptococcus mutans to these saliva-coated S-PRG resin blocks. Elemental analysis of ions absorbed into the salivary coat of resin blocks exposed to the saliva was performed using an inductive coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer and the fluoride electrode method. Quantitative adherence of radio-labeled test bacteria to the resin blocks was determined. As the results, the saliva-coated S-PRG resin showed significantly greater amounts of absorbed B, Al, Si, Sr, and F than the saliva-coated unfilled resin. It was of particular significance that the salivary coating of the S-PRG resin reduced the adherence of S. mutans to this resin. However, in the case of S. sanguinis, no significant difference in adherence could be recognized between saliva-coated S-PRG resin and saliva-coated unfilled resin.
TI  - Systematic screening of plant extracts from the Brazilian Pantanal with antimicrobial activity against bacteria with cariogenic relevance.
AB  - This study proposes a bioprospection methodology regarding the antimicrobial potential of plant extracts against bacteria with cariogenic relevance. Sixty extracts were obtained from ten plants--(1) Jatropha weddelliana, (2) Attalea phalerata, (3) Buchenavia tomentosa, (4) Croton doctoris, (5) Mouriri elliptica, (6) Mascagnia benthamiana, (7) Senna aculeata, (8) Unonopsis guatterioides, (9) Allagoptera leucocalyx and (10) Bactris glaucescens--using different extraction methods - (A) 70 degrees ethanol 72 h/25 degrees C, (B) water 5 min/100 degrees C, (C) water 1 h/55 degrees C, (D) water 72 h/25 degrees C, (E) hexane 72 h/25 degrees C and (F) 90 degrees ethanol 72 h/25 degrees C. The plants were screened for antibacterial activity at 50 mg/ml using the agar well diffusion test against Actinomyces naeslundii ATCC 19039, Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356, Streptococcus gordonii ATCC 10558, Streptococcus mutans ATCC 35688, Streptococcus sanguinis ATCC 10556, Streptococcus sobrinus ATCC 33478 and Streptococcus mitis ATCC 9811. The active extracts were tested to determine their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), cytotoxicity and chemical characterization. Forty-seven extracts (78%) were active against at least one microorganism. Extract 4A demonstrated the lowest MIC and MBC for all microorganisms except S. gordonii and the extract at MIC concentration was non-cytotoxic. The concentrated extracts were slightly cytotoxic. Electrospray ionization with tandem mass spectrometry analyses demonstrated that the extract constituents coincided with the mass of the terpenoids and phenolics. Overall, the best results were obtained for extraction methods A, B and C. The present work proved the antimicrobial activity of several plants. Particularly, extracts from C. doctoris were the most active against bacteria involved in dental caries disease.
TI  - Microbiologically influenced corrosion of orthodontic metallic appliances.
AB  - Biocorrosion (microbiologically influenced corrosion; MIC) occur in aquatic habitats varying in nutrient content, temperature, stress and pH. The oral environment of organisms, including humans, should be one of the most hospitable for MIC. Corrosion of metallic appliances in the oral region is one cause of metal allergy in patients. In this study, an inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer revealed elution of Fe, Cr and Ni from stainless steel (SUS) appliances incubated with oral bacteria. Three-dimensional laser confocal microscopy also revealed that oral bacterial culture promoted increased surface roughness and corrosion pits in SUS appliances. The pH of the supernatant was lowered after co-culture of appliances and oral bacteria in any combinations, but not reached at the level of depassivation pH of their metallic materials. This study showed that Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguinis which easily created biofilm on the surfaces of teeth and appliances, did corrode orthodontic SUS appliances.
TI  - An assessment of the effectiveness of mechanical and chemical cleaning of Essix orthodontic retainer.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of mechanical and chemical cleaning on the removal of microorganisms from Essix orthodontic retainers. DESIGN: In vitro laboratory study. SETTING: Department of Orthodontics and Microbiology, Eastman Dental Institute, University College London, UK. METHODS: Study 1: 120 Essix retainers were divided into four cleaning groups. The effectiveness of each cleaning method to remove a single species biofilm of Streptococcus mutans from the retainer was assessed. Study 2: 140 Essix retainers were divided into four study groups (brushing with fluoride toothpaste, chlorhexidine gel, immersion in chlorhexidine solution only and a control) to investigate the chemical and mechanical cleaning of the multispecies biolfilm of (Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces naeslundii, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans). RELEVANT RESULTS: In study 1, brushing with toothpaste resulted in 99% reduction of Streptococcus mutans. In study 2, all three cleaning methods recorded similarly statistically significant reductions in colony forming units per millilitre compared to the control. There were no statistically significant differences between any of the cleaning groups for any of the microorganisms except MRSA-16. For MRSA-16, chlorhexidine mouthwash and gel were significantly more potent in eliminating the microorganism than the fluoride toothpaste. CONCLUSIONS: All three cleaning methods effectively removed 99% of microorganisms from the Essix retainers. Brushing with fluoride toothpaste can therefore be confirmed as an effective method for cleaning retainers in most circumstances. The use of chlorhexidine gel or mouthwash is recommended in patients where bacterial infection has to be avoided due to immunosuppression or other reasons.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of selected glass ionomer cements.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of the paper was to determine the antibacterial activity of four glass ionomer cements against bacteria of the genera Streptococcus and Lactobacillus. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Four capsulated glass ionomer cements were applied in the study: Fuji Triage (GC), Fuji IX (GC), Ketac Molar (3M Espe) and Ketac Silver (3M Espe). Four standard bacterial strains were used to assess the antibacterial activity of the studied cements: Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, S. salivarius and Lactobacillus casei. The antibacterial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method. The bacterial suspension was spread with a cotton swab on TSA plates. For each material six wells (7 mm diameter, 5 mm deep) were made with a cork borer. Each well was then filled with freshly prepared cements. The results were obtained by measuring the bacterial growth inhibition zone after 1, 2, 3 and 7 days. RESULTS: Fuji Triage cement inhibited the growth of all bacterial strains. Fuji IX cement demonstrated the most potent antibacterial activity against S. sanguis. Ketac Molar showed antibacterial activity against S. sanguis and S. salivarius, whereas Ketac Silver was efficient against S. mutans as well. Neither of the Ketac cements inhibited growth of the standard L. casei strain. DISCUSSION: Antibacterial activity of glass ionomer cements has attracted the interest of scientists in recent years. Most authors, including us, carried out experiments using the agar diffusion method and demonstrated antibacterial activity of glass ionomer cements. Different antibacterial activity of glass ionomer cements, observed in our study and studies of other authors, depended on the evaluated cement, bacterial strain and period of evaluation.
TI  - [Protein structure prediction of the lactate dehydrogenase of Streptococcus oligofermentans].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the gene sequence and protein structure of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in Streptococcus oligofermentans with those of other bacteria with different acid generating capacities in oral cavity and to analyze the differences of their LDH. METHODS: LDH gene sequence of Streptococcus oligofermentans was measured by Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. LDH gene sequences of four Streptococcus and Lactobacillus casei in the NCBI Genbank was identified and compared among the six bacteria's LDH gene sequences and amino acid sequences by BLAST software. ExPASy database was used to predict the physical-chemical characteristics, secondary structure, trans-membrane regions, and spatial structure of Streptococcus oligofermentans LDH protein, which was compared with those of other bacteria. RESULTS: The full-length of the LDH gene sequences of Streptococcus oligofermentans was 987 base pairs. The highest similarity was 89% with that of the Streptococcus sanguis, and 81% similarity with Streptococcus mutans, and 70% similarity with Lactobacillus casei. LDH amino acid sequence of Streptococcus oligofermentans was similar to Streptococcus sanguinis, with the highest similitude of 96%, with a similitude of 81% to Streptococcus mutans, but differed greatly from that of Lactobacillus casei, with a similitude of only 66%. Streptococcus oligofermentans LDH protein's physical-chemical characteristics, trans-membrane region's numbers, proportions of secondary structure, structural domain's location resembled those of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis and Lactobacillus casei. Spatial structure differences between the LDH of Streptococcus oligofermentans and that of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus casei were distinct. CONCLUSIONS: Streptococcus oligofermentans LDH's gene sequence, amino acid sequence, and spatial structure all vary from those of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus casei, and these differeces may be a inherent reason that lead to the changes of its LDH's biological functions and incapacity of producing lactic acid.
TI  - [Evaluation of biocidal properties of silver nanoparticles against cariogenic bacteria].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles (SNP's) have been  recentl well evaluated, and now are being considered as excellent candidates for therapeutic purposes. It is confirmed, that various solutions of colloidal SNP's possess significant antibacterial properties against such species as: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa even at low concentrations, although there have been so far only a few researches evaluating antimicrobial activity of SNP's against cariogenic bacteria: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus mitis responsible for initiation of dental carries. Tooth decay is infectious disease an worldwide, which may occur in patients of every age. Nanotechnology creates a new approach of designing of medical devices preventing or reducing bacterial colonization. METHODS: Colloidal silver solution (CSS) of concentration 350 ppm was used in this research. Nanoparticles size, shape and solution stability were evaluated. 16 strains of cariogenic bacteria, 4 isolates of each species: S. mutans, S. salivarius, S. sanguinis and S, mitis were obtained from plaque swabs of 7 patients treated for dental carries at Department of Conservative Dentistry, Medical University of Warsaw. MIC and MBC values for CSS's were evaluated. RESULTS: CSS used in this research is of good stability. No agglomeration or coalescence was observed during 24 hours of experiment. Silver nanoparticles were of round shape and had mean size of 67 nm. MIC values were: 12-25 ppm for S. salivarius, 25 ppm for S. sanguinis, 50-100 ppm for S. mitis and 50 ppm for S. mutans, while MBC values after 1 hour of bacterial contact with nanoparticles were 200-350 ppm for all cariogenic bacterial species. After 24 hours of contact MBC values were: 25-50 ppm for S. salivarius and S. sanguinis, 100-200 ppm for S. mitis and 200 ppmfor S. mutans. CONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobial properties of CSS depend on nanoparticles concentration and interaction time with bacteria. The susceptibility of cariogenic oral streptococci to silver nanoparticles is diversified. Sufficient concentration which inhibited all cariogenic bacteria in our research was 200 ppm after long (24 hours) period of silver nanoparticles interaction with bacteria.
TI  - Cariogenicity of Streptococcus mutans glucan-binding protein deletion mutants.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans is a principal etiologic agent in the development of dental  caries due to its exceptional aciduric and acidogenic properties, and its ability to adhere and accumulate in large numbers on tooth surfaces in the presence of sucrose. Sucrose-dependent adherence is mediated by glucans, polymers of glucose synthesized from sucrose by glucosyltransferase (Gtf) enzymes. S. mutans makes several proteins that have the property of binding glucans. We hypothesized that three of these glucan-binding proteins (Gbps), Gbps A, C and D, contribute to the cariogenicity of S. mutans. A specific pathogen-free rat model was used to compare the cariogenicity of S. mutans UA130 and a panel of mutants with individual or multiple gbp gene deletions. The mutants were also evaluated in vitro for properties related to cariogenicity, such as acidogenicity, aciduricity, and adhesion to glucan. Only a subset of Gbp mutants were attenuated for cariogenicity, with the combined loss of Gbps A and C most affecting smooth surface caries. The attenuation of Gbp mutant strains was unlikely due to differences in acid-related properties since the mutants were at least as acidogenic and acid-tolerant as the parental strain. Additionally, loss of Gbps did not reduce adhesion to a pre-formed biofilm of S. sanguinis. Analyses of the caries data with in vitro biofilm properties previously determined for the mutant panel found correlations between cariogenicity and biofilm depth and substratum coverage. It is concluded that Gbps contribute to the cariogenicity of S. mutans through a mechanism that may involve alteration of biofilm architecture.
TI  - [The Bayesian framework of detection of cariesgenic Streptoccocus in dental plaque in children with distal occlusion under orthodontic treatment].
AB  - The application of Bayes theorem in medical diagnostic includes such important step as derivation for every symptom and diagnosis data values of finite or a posteriori probability of presence of germ, for instance S. sanguis, in patients receiving orthodontic treatment. This value expresses importance of the given symptoms for detection of germ presence. In the implemented studies the Bayes theorem was applied to evaluate probability of presence of particular germ in particular concentration (degree of semination, CO) under concrete symptom group. The rates were used to calculate probability of presence of cariesgenic streptococcus S. mutans and S. sanguis in prospect patient. The rates were calculated for the group with fixed orthodontic apparatuses. The high degree of risk of development of caries in children under orthodontic treatment is conditioned by a whole complex of existing unfavorable factors present in oral cavity. Hence, a powerful negative potential to develop expressed cariesgenic situation in oral cavity is present. The analysis of medical data of patients with distal occlusion was applied using Bayes theorem from the point of view their diagnostic value. The study established 36 symptoms, factors, risk factors and background diseases common in case of distal occlusion in children. The probability to detect the mentioned characteristics and likelihood ratio under different degree of concentration of cariesgenic Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis in dental plaque of children was considered. The establishment of character of likelihood ratio for different qualitative content of streptococcus in case of isolation from biotope of dental plaque permitted to determine the informative characteristics. The Bayesian model can be applied in clinics as a computer program to process incoming information about patients with distal occlusion under active orthodontic treatment. The developed diagnostic algorithm in a fast and simple mode of clinical detection of caries and determination of concentration of cariesgenic Streptococcus.
TI  - Comparative analysis of colony counts of different species of oral streptococci in saliva of dentulous, edentulous and in those wearing partial and complete dentures.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study and compare the number of colony forming units of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus milleri in dentulous, edentulous and in those wearing partial and complete dentures by using semi-quantitative culture method of saliva samples with calibrated standard loop. MATERIALS: Sterile specimen collection bottles, Mitis salivarius agar plates, Standard loop, Candle jar, Incubator, Colony counter. METHODOLOGY: Study population consisted of 100 subjects with 25 in each group, with an age range of 40 to 80 years, who were attending the Department of Community Dentistry and Prosthodontics at MNR Dental College, Sangareddy, Hyderabad. Unstimulated saliva samples were collected from patients and inoculated on to Mitis salivarius agar plates using calibrated standard loop. The plates were then incubated anaerobically at 37 degrees C for 24 hours and left at room temperature for further 24 hours. Using a colony counter, the number of colonies of each species was counted. RESULTS: Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus mitis predominates in the dentulous group, Streptococcus sanguis in complete denture group, Streptococcus salivarius in edentulous group and Streptococcus milleri in removable partial denture group. CONCLUSION: The results of our study are in accordance with the previous studies, which have sought to differentiate different groups of mutans streptococci using a simple calibrated standard loop.
TI  - Adhesion forces and composition of planktonic and adhering oral microbiomes.
AB  - The oral microbiome consists of a planktonic microbiome residing in saliva and an adhering microbiome (the biofilm adhering to oral hard and soft tissues). Here we hypothesized that possible differences in microbial composition of the planktonic and adhering oral microbiome on teeth can be related to the forces by which different bacterial species are attracted to the tooth surface. The relative presence of 7 oral bacterial species in saliva and biofilm collected from 10 healthy human volunteers was determined twice in each volunteer by denaturing-gradient-gel electrophoresis. Analysis of both microbiomes showed complete separation of the planktonic from the adhering oral microbiome. Next, adhesion forces of corresponding bacterial strains with saliva-coated enamel surfaces were measured by atomic force microscopy. Species that were found predominantly in the adhering microbiome had significantly higher adhesion forces to saliva-coated enamel (-0.60 to -1.05 nN) than did species mostly present in the planktonic microbiome (-0.40 to -0.55 nN). It is concluded that differences in composition of the planktonic and the adhering oral microbiome are due to small differences in the forces by which strains adhere to saliva-coated enamel, providing an important step in understanding site- and material-specific differences in the composition of biofilms in the oral cavity.
TI  - Effect of nicotine on dual-species biofilms of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguinis.
AB  - Both Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguinis are normal bacterial inhabitants of dental plaque. Streptococcus mutans is the major agent causing dental caries. It has been well documented that nicotine affects the growth of S. mutans. This study investigated the effect of nicotine on mono- and dual-species growth of S. mutans and S. sanguinis. The results indicate that nicotine has no significant effect on S. sanguinis grown in either mono- or dual-species biofilms. However, nicotine significantly increased (P < 0.05) the growth of S. mutans in dual-species biofilm formation. In addition, the CFU level of S. sanguinis was higher than S. mutans without nicotine in the culture. With the addition of nicotine, the level of S. mutans biofilm was significantly enhanced as the nicotine concentration increased over the level of S. sanguinis in dual-species biofilm, and we also got the same result from the fluorescence in situ hybridization detecting the two bacteria grown in biofilm formation. The exopolysaccharide (EPS) of S. mutans has also been increased by the increasing nicotine concentration, while the EPS of S. sanguinis was decreased or inhibited by the affected nicotine. The data further confirm that nicotine is able to enhance the growth of S. mutans.
TI  - Does photodynamic therapy enhance standard antibacterial therapy in dentistry?
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess whether or not photodynamic therapy enhanced standard antibacterial therapy in dentistry. BACKGROUND DATA: Photodynamic therapy when used as an adjunct to conventional periodontal therapy kills more bacteria than when conventional periodontal therapy is used alone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To address the focused question, "Does photodynamic therapy enhance killing of oral bacteria?" PubMed/MEDLINE((R)) and Google Scholar databases were explored. Original human and experimental studies and studies using photodynamic therapy for killing oral bacteria were included. Letters to the Editor, historic reviews, and unpublished data were excluded. RESULTS: Photodynamic therapy significantly reduces periodontopathogenic bacteria including Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Photodynamic therapy kills cariogenic bacteria (such as Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis), bacteria associated with infected root canals, and those associated with periimplantitis. CONCLUSIONS: Photodynamic therapy, when used as an adjunct to conventional oral disinfection protocols, enhances standard antibacterial therapy in dentistry.
TI  - A tissue-dependent hypothesis of dental caries.
AB  - Current understanding of dental caries considers this disease a demineralization  of the tooth tissues due to the acid produced by sugar-fermenting microorganisms. Thus, caries is considered a diet- and pH-dependent process. We present here the first metagenomic analysis of the bacterial communities present at different stages of caries development, with the aim of determining whether the bacterial composition and biochemical profile are specific to the tissue affected. The data show that microbial composition at the initial, enamel-affecting stage of caries is significantly different from that found at subsequent stages, as well as from dental plaque of sound tooth surfaces. Although the relative proportion of Streptococcus mutans increased from 0.12% in dental plaque to 0.72% in enamel caries, Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus sanguinis were the dominant streptococci in these lesions. The functional profile of caries-associated bacterial communities indicates that genes involved in acid stress tolerance and dietary sugar fermentation are overrepresented only at the initial stage (enamel caries), whereas other genes coding for osmotic stress tolerance as well as collagenases and other proteases enabling dentin degradation are significantly overrepresented in dentin cavities. The results support a scenario in which pH and diet are determinants of the disease during the degradation of enamel, but in dentin caries lesions not only acidogenic but also proteolytic bacteria are involved. We propose that caries disease is a process of varying etiology, in which acid-producing bacteria are the vehicle to penetrate enamel and allow dentin degrading microorganisms to expand the cavity.
TI  - In vitro antagonistic growth effects of Lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus salivarius and their fermentative broth on periodontal pathogens.
AB  - As lactobacilli possess an antagonistic growth property, these bacteria may be beneficial as bioprotective agents for infection control. However, whether the antagonistic growth effects are attributed to the lactobacilli themselves or their fermentative broth remains unclear. The antagonistic growth effects of Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactobacillus fermentum as well as their fermentative broth were thus tested using both disc agar diffusion test and broth dilution method, and their effects on periodontal pathogens, including Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, and Porphyromonas gingivalis in vitro at different concentrations and for different time periods were also compared. Both Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactobacillus fermentum and their concentrated fermentative broth were shown to inhibit significantly the growth of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, although different inhibitory effects were observed for different pathogens. The higher the counts of lactobacilli and the higher the folds of concentrated fermentative broth, the stronger the inhibitory effects are observed. The inhibitory effect is demonstrated to be dose-dependent. Moreover, for the lactobacilli themselves, Lactobacillus fermentum showed stronger inhibitory effects than Lactobacillus salivarius. However, the fermentative broth of Lactobacillus fermentum showed weaker inhibitory effects than that of Lactobacillus salivarius. These data suggested that lactobacilli and their fermentative broth exhibit antagonistic growth activity, and consumption of probiotics or their broth containing lactobacilli may benefit oral health.
TI  - Antimicrobial effects of herbal extracts on Streptococcus mutans and normal oral  streptococci.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans is associated with dental caries. A cariogenic biofilm, in particular, has been studied extensively for its role in the formation of dental caries. Herbal extracts such as Cudrania tricuspidata, Sophora flavescens, Ginkgo biloba, and Betula Schmidtii have been used as a folk remedy for treating diseases. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the antibacterial activity of herbal extracts against normal oral streptococci, planktonic and biofilm of S. mutans. Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguinis, and S. mutans were cultivated with brain heart infusion broth and susceptibility assay for the herbal extracts was performed according to the protocol of Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute. Also, S. mutans biofilm was formed on a polystyrene 12-well plate and 8-well chamber glass slip using BHI broth containing 2% sucrose and 1% mannose after conditioning the plate and the glass slip with unstimulated saliva. The biofilm was treated with the herbal extracts in various concentrations and inoculated on Mitis-Salivarius bacitracin agar plate for enumeration of viable S. mutans by counting colony forming units. Planktonic S. mutans showed susceptibility to all of the extracts and S. mutans biofilm exhibited the highest level of sensitivity for the extracts of S. flavescens. The normal oral streptococci exhibited a weak susceptibility in comparison to S. mutans. S. oralis, however, was resistant to all of the extracts. In conclusion, the extract of S. flavescens may be a potential candidate for prevention and management of dental caries.
TI  - [Comparison of in vitro antimicrobial activities of bioaggregate and mineral trioxide aggregate].
AB  - Treatment outcome of endodontic perforations depends on successful elimination of the associated microorganisms and infected tissues as well as the effective seal of the root-end or perforation site to prevent future contamination. Ideally, perforation repair material has to be bacteriostatic or bactericidal in order to prevent bacterial contamination as well as good sealing properties and biocompatibility. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effects of BioAggregate (BA) and Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA) on the standard strains of Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa using the agar disc diffusion test. Colonies of each strains were harvested from the medium and microorganisms were diluted to obtain a suspension of approximately 108 cfu/ml. Petri plates with blood agar base with 5% sheep blood or Sabouraud dextrose agar (for C.albicans) were inoculated with experimental suspensions and BA and MTA discs prepared as 2 mm length and 6 mm diameter were placed. After 24 and 48 hours incubation, the diameters of the zones of inhibition were measured. The results of the disc diffusion tests showed that BA and MTA were effective on the tested microorganisms at 24 and 48 hours incubation periods. BA and MTA showed similar antimicrobial effects on C.albicans and E.coli. BA was more effective than MTA on S.mutans, E.faecalis and P.aeruginosa, however MTA was more effective than BA on S.sanguinis at 48 hours. When the time efficiency of the materials were compared, there was no statistically difference between 24 to 48 hours on E.coli, E.faecalis, S.mutans, S.sanguinis in both two groups (p> 0.05). There was statistically significant decrease 24 to 48 hours on C.albicans in BA and MTA groups and P.aeruginosa in BA group (p< 0.05). It can be concluded that although BA and MTA displayed similar antimicrobial efficacy on the tested microorganisms newly improved material BA demonstrated superior antimicrobial activity than other.
TI  - Development of a tunable wide-range gene induction system useful for the study of streptococcal toxin-antitoxin systems.
AB  - Despite the plethora of genetic tools that have been developed for use in Streptococcus mutans, the S. mutans genetic system still lacks an effective gene induction system exhibiting low basal expression and strong inducibility. Consequently, we created two hybrid gene induction cassettes referred to as Xyl-S1 and Xyl-S2. Both Xyl-S cassettes are xylose inducible and controlled by the Bacillus megaterium xylose repressor. The Xyl-S cassettes each demonstrated >600-fold-increased reporter activity in the presence of 1.2% (wt/vol) xylose. However, the Xyl-S1 cassette yielded a much higher maximum level of gene expression, whereas the Xyl-S2 cassette exhibited much lower uninduced basal expression. The cassettes also performed similarly in Streptococcus sanguinis and Streptococcus gordonii, which suggests that they are likely to be useful in a variety of streptococci. We demonstrate how both Xyl-S cassettes are particularly useful for the study of toxin-antitoxin (TA) modules using both the previously characterized S. mutans mazEF TA module and a previously uncharacterized HicAB TA module in S. mutans. HicAB TA modules are widely distributed among bacteria and archaea, but little is known about their function. We show that HicA serves as the toxin component of the module, while HicB serves as the antitoxin. Our results suggest that, in contrast to that of typical TA modules, HicA toxicity in S. mutans is modest at best. The implications of these results for HicAB function are discussed.
TI  - Inhibition of initial adhesion of oral bacteria through a lectin from Bauhinia variegata L. var. variegata expressed in Escherichia coli.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of the present work was to study the in vitro effect of native and  recombinant Bauhinia variegata var. variegata lectins in inhibiting early adhesion of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus sobrinus to experimentally acquired pellicle. METHODS AND RESULTS: Native lectin from B. variegata (BVL) was purified by affinity chromatography of extract of seeds. The recombinant lectin (rBVL-I) was expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) from a genomic clone encoding the mature B. variegata lectin gene using the vector pAE-bvlI. Recombinant protein deposited in inclusion bodies was solubilized and subsequently purified by affinity chromatography. The rBVL-I was compared to BVL for agglutination of erythrocytes and initial adherence of oral bacteria on a saliva-coated surface. The results revealed that rBVL-I acts similarly to BVL for agglutination of erythrocytes. Both lectins showed adhesion inhibition effect on Step. sanguis, Step. mutans and Step. sobrinus. CONCLUSION: We report, for the first time, the inhibition of early adhesion of oral bacteria by a recombinant lectin. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Our results support the proposed biotechnological application of lectins in a strategy to reduce development of dental caries by inhibiting the initial adhesion and biofilm formation.
TI  - A high-sensitive and non-radioisotopic fluorescence dye method for evaluating bacterial adhesion to denture materials.
AB  - Oral bacteria adhered to dental material surfaces are known to cause various oral diseases. This study aimed to develop a highsensitive and non-radioisotopic fluorescence dye method for quantification of oral bacteria (Streptococcus, Actinomyces and Veillonella) adhered to denture material surfaces. The amount of adhered bacteria was estimated from the fluorescence intensity derived from resazurin, which is reduced by bacterial metabolic reactions. The addition of bacterial metabolic substrates (glucose for Streptococcus and Actinomyces and sodium lactate for Veillonella) to the reaction mixture increased the fluorescence intensity by 2.3-110 times, subsequently improved the sensitivity. Furthermore, an experimental device having silicon wells containing test material was carefully designed for accurate quantification of bacteria adhered to test materials. The improved resazurin method using a new experimental device successfully enabled the quantification of bacterial adhesion to polymethyl methacrylate and other three conventional denture materials.
TI  - Antibacterial Effect of Juglans Regia Bark against Oral Pathologic Bacteria.
AB  - Background. In this study antimicrobial effect of ethanolic and aqueous extracts  of Juglans regia bark in Iran was evaluated on four different oral bacteria, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis, and Staphylococcus aureus. Methods. Aqueous and ethanol extracts of Juglans regia bark were prepared by using disk diffusion technique and Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) methods. Tetracycline 30 mu g and Erythromycin 15 mu g were used as positive control and water as negative control in disk diffusion and MIC methods. Data were analyzed by ANOVA test. Results. The results showed that S. sanguis and S. mutans were the most sensitive and the most resistant bacteria against ethanolic and aqueous extracts, respectively. Ethanolic extract had significant antibacterial effect against all tested bacteria. Aqueous extract did not show antibacterial effect on S. mutans, in contrast to ethanolic extract. Aqueous extract had significantly antibacterial effect against Staphylococcus aureus, S. salivarius, and S. sanguis compared to control (P < 0.0001), but it did not show effect on S. mutans when compared with Erythromycin. According to the obtained MIC values, ethanol extract of Juglans regia bark had the lowest rate. Conclusion. The results may provide the basis for using natural antimicrobial substance for oral hygiene prophylaxis purposes.
TI  - Involvement of gshAB in the interspecies competition within oral biofilm.
AB  - Although Streptococcus sanguinis has been reported to produce H2O2 to gain a competitive edge over Streptococcus mutans, the molecular mechanisms evolved by S. mutans to counter this "peer stress" are still to be identified. The current study was designed to investigate the ecological role of glutathione synthetase (gshAB) in the interspecies interaction between S. mutans and S. sanguinis. A gshAB in-frame deletion strain of S. mutans was constructed, and its phenotypic traits were characterized. The spatio-temporal interaction of the gshAB mutant with S. sanguinis was further investigated in a dual-species biofilm model by fluorescence in situ hybridization. We found that, although less tolerant for H2O2, the gshAB mutant produced more extracellular polysaccharides by up-regulating gtfs expression, so as to cluster as condensed microcolonies. In addition, the mutant was more susceptible to the conditioned medium of S. sanguinis, and its competitiveness was significantly compromised. Taken together, we believe that gshAB is essential for the competitiveness and prevalence of S. mutans through detoxifying the H2O2 produced by S. sanguinis. Given the ecological importance of bacterial equilibrium within the oral biofilm, gshAB may represent a promising target to modulate the S. mutans/S. sanguinis ratio under cariogenic conditions, thus contributing to the management of dental caries.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of different concentrations of garlic (Allium sativum) extract on dental plaque bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Allium sativum, commonly known as garlic, exhibits antibacterial effects against a wide range of bacteria. AIM: The objective of this in vitro study was to assess the antibacterial effect of different concentrations of garlic extract against human dental plaque microbiota. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antibacterial activities of four different concentrations of garlic extract (5%, 10%, 20%, and 100%) were evaluated against Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and lactobacillus spp. using the disk diffusion method. Papers soaked in 0.2% concentration chlorhexidine gluconate and saline were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The data were subjected to one-way ANOVA and the Tukey multiple comparisons test at a 5% significance level. RESULTS: All bacterial strains were inhibited by all test materials. The inhibition zones of the different concentrations of garlic extract were not significantly different for S. mutans, S. sanguis, and S. salivarius. For P. aeruginosa and lactobacillus spp. the inhibition zones of 5%, 10% and 20% concentrations were not significantly different from one another, but they were significantly more than that of the 100% extract. CONCLUSION: The 5%, 10%, 20%, and 100% concentrations of garlic extract had similar effects, so further studies seem to be indicated on the usefulness of the 5% extract.
TI  - Adhesion and biofilm formation by oral streptococci on different commercial brackets.
AB  - AIM: To compare early bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation in vitro by different oral streptococci on a variety of commercial brackets. METHODS: Adhesion and biofilm formation in vitro of 6 Streptococcus spp. on 15 different commercial brackets, in standard culture medium and in human saliva were evaluated by the MTT reduction assay. RESULTS: Significant differences were evidenced in both early adhesion and biofilm formation among the studied brackets and between the two conditions of growth. Gold brackets resulted less prone to colonisation compared to composite brackets. The growth rates of the tested species on the different tested materials were significantly different. CONCLUSION: The adopted experimental plan, dissecting the two phases of plaque formation on different brackets in different conditions, showed that composite brackets are more susceptible to adhesion and colonisation by streptococci, while the remaining tested brackets did not show differences that could be clinically relevant. Data suggest that different personal behaviours affecting the oral environment could significantly affect colonisation of brackets by oral streptococci.
TI  - Aggravation of inflammatory bowel diseases by oral streptococci.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Streptococcus mutans can aggravate colitis in mice. We evaluated the  virulence of colitis using type strains as well as blood isolates of several oral streptococcal species. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the susceptibility of blood isolates of several oral streptococci to phagocytosis, adhesion to and invasion of hepatic cells and interferon-gamma secretion. A mouse model of dextran sodium sulphate-induced colitis was used to evaluate bacterial aggravation of colitis. In addition, interferon-gamma antibody was administered to mice with prominent aggravation of colitis. RESULTS: In vitro analyses showed that Streptococcus sanguinis ATCC 10556 was a possible virulent strain among type strains of several oral streptococci, and that analysis of blood isolates of S. sanguinis TW289 revealed a potential virulent strain. Intravenous administration of ATCC 10556 and TW289 caused prominent aggravation of dextran sodium sulphate-induced colitis, and histopathological examinations showed that interferon-gamma secretion due to infection of hepatic cells caused colitis aggravation. Administration of interferon-gamma antibody suppressed TW289-induced colitis. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that some virulent oral streptococcal strains are associated with the aggravation of colitis induced by enhanced secretion of interferon-gamma when they invade the bloodstream.
TI  - Cloning-independent plasmid construction for genetic studies in streptococci.
AB  - Shuttle plasmids are among the few routinely utilized tools in the Streptococcus  mutans genetic system that still require the use of classical cloning methodologies and intermediate hosts for genetic manipulation. Accordingly, it typically requires considerably less time and effort to introduce mutations onto the S. mutans chromosome than it does to construct shuttle vectors for expressing genes in trans. Occasionally, shuttle vector constructs also exhibit toxicity in Escherichia coli, which prevents their proper assembly. To circumvent these limitations, we modified a prolonged overlap extension PCR (POE-PCR) protocol to facilitate direct plasmid assembly in S. mutans. Using solely PCR, we created the reporter vector pZX7, which contains a single minimal streptococcal replication origin and harbors a spectinomycin resistance cassette and the gusA gene encoding beta-glucuronidase. We compared the efficiency of pZX7 assembly using multiple strains of S. mutans and were able to obtain from 5 x 10(3) to 2 x 10(5) CFU/mug PCR product. Likewise, we used pZX7 to further demonstrate that Streptococcus sanguinis and Streptococcus gordonii are also excellent hosts for cloning-independent plasmid assembly, which suggests that this system is likely to function in numerous other streptococci. Consequently, it should be possible to completely forgo the use of E. coli-Streptococcus shuttle vectors in many streptococcal species, thereby decreasing the time and effort required to assemble constructs and eliminating any toxicity issues associated with intermediate hosts.
TI  - Distribution of Streptococcus troglodytae and Streptococcus dentirousetti in chimpanzee oral cavities.
AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze the distribution and phenotypic properties of the indigenous streptococci in chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) oral cavities. Eleven chimpanzees (aged from 9 to 44 years, mean +/- SD, 26.9 +/- 12.6 years) in the Primate Research Institute of Kyoto University were enrolled in this research and brushing bacterial samples collected from them. Streptococci were isolated from the oral cavities of all chimpanzees. The isolates (n = 46) were identified as thirteen species by 16S rRNA genes analysis. The predominant species was Streptococcus sanguinis of mitis streptococci from five chimpanzees (45%). Mutans streptococci were isolated from six chimpanzees (55%). The predominant species in the mutans streptococci were Streptococcus troglodytae from four chimpanzees (36%), this species having been proposed as a novel species by us, and Streptococcus dentirousetti from three chimpanzees (27%). Streptococcus mutans was isolated from one chimpanzee (9%). However, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus macacae and Streptococcus downei, which are indigenous to human and monkey (Macaca fasciclaris) oral habitats, were not isolated. Of the mutans streptococci, S. troglodytae, S. dentirousetti, and S. mutans possessed strong adherence activity to glass surface.

TI  - Early in vitro and in vivo development of high-level daptomycin resistance is common in mitis group Streptococci after exposure to daptomycin.
AB  - The development of high-level daptomycin resistance (HLDR; MIC of >/= 256 mg/liter) after exposure to daptomycin has recently been reported in viridans group streptococcus (VGS) isolates. Our study objectives were as follows: to know whether in vitro development of HLDR after exposure to daptomycin was common among clinical isolates of VGS and Streptococcus bovis; to determine whether HLDR also developed during the administration of daptomycin to treat experimental endocarditis caused by the daptomycin-susceptible, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus mitis strain S. mitis 351; and to establish whether combination with gentamicin prevented the development of HLDR in vitro and in vivo. In vitro studies were performed with 114 VGS strains (mitis group, 92; anginosus group, 10; mutans group, 8; and salivarius group, 4) and 54 Streptococcus bovis strains isolated from 168 consecutive patients with infective endocarditis diagnosed between 1995 and 2010. HLDR was only observed after 24 h of exposure to daptomycin in 27% of the mitis group, including 27% of S. mitis isolates, 47% of S. oralis isolates, and 13% of S. sanguis isolates. In our experimental model, HLDR was detected in 7/11 (63%) and 8/12 (67%) isolates recovered from vegetations after 48 h of daptomycin administered at 6 mg/kg of body weight/24 h and 10 mg/kg/24 h, respectively. In vitro, time-kill experiments showed that daptomycin plus gentamicin was bactericidal against S. mitis 351 at tested concentrations of 0.5 and 1 times the MIC and prevented the development of HLDR. In vivo, the addition of gentamicin at 1 mg/kg/8 h to both daptomycin arms prevented HLDR in 21 out of 23 (91%) rabbits. Daptomycin plus gentamicin was at least as effective as vancomycin plus gentamicin. In conclusion, HLDR develops rapidly and frequently in vitro and in vivo among mitis group streptococci. Combining daptomycin with gentamicin enhanced its activity and prevented the development of HLDR in most cases.
TI  - A defined-multispecies microbial model for studying enamel caries development.
AB  - The aims of this study were to describe and validate an in vitro multispecies microbial biofilm model for caries development by evaluating the effects of varying medium concentration of sucrose (0.5 and 1.0%) and fluoride (0.4, 0.8 and 1.0 ppm F) in study 1, and calcium (1.0 and 2.0 mM Ca) in study 2. Defined-multispecies biofilms, formed by Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus mutans, S. salivarius and S. sanguinis, were grown on the surface of salivary-pellicle-coated enamel slabs, with known baseline surface hardness; growth medium was changed daily. Counts of viable cells on biofilms and the percentage of surface microhardness change (%SMC), lesion depth (LD) and integrated mineral loss (IML) on enamel slabs were assessed after 4 days of biofilm formation under the tested conditions. Counts of viable cells on biofilms were significantly affected by sucrose, fluoride and calcium concentrations (p < 0.05). There was a decrease in %SMC in response to increased fluoride and calcium concentrations (p < 0.001). Lower IML (p < 0.001) and LD (p < 0.05) were found in the presence of 0.8 and 1.0 ppm F. A negative correlation was found between the response variables (%SMC, LD and IML) and fluoride and calcium concentrations. The results suggest that the microbial caries model developed was able to show distinct levels of caries inhibition in response to fluoride and calcium concentrations, corroborating clinical observations. An effect of sucrose concentration on caries development was found only in the presence of the lowest fluoride concentration.
TI  - The efficacy of neem extract on four microorganisms responsible for causing dental caries viz Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus sanguis: an in vitro study.
AB  - HISTORY AND OBJECTIVES: From the ancient time, neem used to be the traditional medicine for many diseases and was mainly used for cleaning the oral cavity. The incidence of dental caries was less a few decades ago but now the incidence of caries is very aggressive. This might be due to change in dietary habits, life style and more tendency toward processed food. The objective of this study is to find out the truth that if the neem is really efficacious against caries-inducing microorganisms, mainly Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus sanguis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The dried neem sticks ground into a coarse powder and weighed into 5, 10 and 50 gm were added to 100 ml of deionized double distilled water. After soaking for 2 days, the water was filtered at 4 degrees C and the fine filtrate was inoculated onto blood agar plates contains individual species of microorganisms and incubated at 37 degrees C for 2 days. RESULTS: At maximum concentrations, neem extract has shown the maximum zone of inhibition on Streptococcus mutans. At less concentration, the efficacy of neem has shown some inhibition of growth for all the four species of microorganisms. CONCLUSION: Neem chewing provides the maximum benefits. Hence, the use of chewing sticks of neem can be recommended.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of the synthetic peptide Lys-a1 against oral streptococci.
AB  - The peptide LYS-[TRP(6)]-Hy-A1 (Lys-a1) is a synthetic derivative of the peptide  Hy-A1, initially isolated from the frog species Hypsiboas albopunctatus. According to previous research, it is a molecule with broad antimicrobial activity. The objective of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the synthetic peptide Lys-a1 (KIFGAIWPLALGALKNLIK-NH2) on the planktonic and biofilm growth of oral bacteria. The methods used to evaluate antimicrobial activity include the following: determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) in microtiter plates for growth in suspension and quantification of biomass by crystal violet staining and counting of colony forming units for biofilm growth. The microorganisms Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus parasanguinis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus were grown in Brain Heart Infusion broth at 37 degrees C under atmospheric pressure with 10% CO2. The peptide was solubilized in 0.1% acetic acid (v/v) at various concentrations (500-1.9 mug mL(-1)). Chlorhexidine gluconate 0.12% was used as the positive control, and BHI culture medium was used as the negative control. The tested peptide demonstrated a remarkable antimicrobial effect, inhibiting the planktonic and biofilm growth of all strains tested, even at low concentrations. Thus, the peptide Lys-a1 is an important source for potential antimicrobial agents, especially for the control and prevention of microbial biofilms, which is one of the most important factors in cariogenic processes.
TI  - Enantiomeric HPLC resolution and absolute stereochemistry assignment of a new poligamain derivative.
AB  - A new aryltetralin lignan derivative, 1, was obtained by reacting dimethyl succinate and piperonal, furnishing the lactone 4-(3',4'-methylenedioxybenzyl)-4,5-dihydro-2(3H)-furanone, which was reacted once again with piperonal and LDA to give the dibenzylbutirolactone 7-hydroxyhinokinin. The cyclization of 7-hydroxyhinokinin into polygamain occurred in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid. The reduction of the furanic ring of polygamain was done by its reaction with DIBAL in THF, furnishing the diol functionalized lignin derivative 1 as single diastereomer. The enantiomeric fractions of 1 were obtained by preparative enantioselective HPLC. The absolute stereochemistry was assigned by electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. An all-trans relative configuration was determined by NMR on the bases of (1)H coupling constants and nuclear Overhauser effect (n.O.e.) experiments. The absolute configuration at C1 was assigned on the basis of the ECD sign at 296 nm by comparison to the ECD spectra of structural analogues with defined stereochemistry. The assignment of the absolute configuration was confirmed by applying the exciton chirality method to the well-defined ECD couplets at 285 and 200 nm allied to the two electronic transitions L(b) and B(b) of the aromatic moieties, respectively. Rac-1 and its enantiomeric isomers were evaluated against important bacteria responsible for dental caries. The best results obtained for the (1R,2S,3S) isomer were against Streptococcus mutans (250 muM), Streptococcus salivarius (250 muM), Streptococcus sobrinus (280 muM) and Streptococcus mitis (280 muM). The (1S,2R,3R) isomer was active only against Streptococcus sanguinis (280 muM). The enantiomeric mixture was less active than the (1R,2S,3S) isomer.
TI  - dpr and sod in Streptococcus mutans are involved in coexistence with S. sanguinis, and PerR is associated with resistance to H2O2.
AB  - Large numbers of bacteria coexist in the oral cavity. Streptococcus sanguinis, one of the major bacteria in dental plaque, produces hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), which interferes with the growth of other bacteria. Streptococcus mutans, a cariogenic bacterium, can coexist with S. sanguinis in dental plaque, but to do so, it needs a means of detoxifying the H(2)O(2) produced by S. sanguinis. In this study, we investigated the association of three oxidative stress factors, Dpr, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and AhpCF, with the resistance of S. sanguinis to H(2)O(2). The knockout of dpr and sod significantly increased susceptibility to H(2)O(2), while the knockout of ahpCF had no apparent effect on susceptibility. In particular, dpr inactivation resulted in hypersensitivity to H(2)O(2). Next, we sought to identify the factor(s) involved in the regulation of these oxidative stress genes and found that PerR negatively regulated dpr expression. The knockout of perR caused increased dpr expression levels, resulting in low-level susceptibility to H(2)O(2) compared with the wild type. Furthermore, we evaluated the roles of perR, dpr, and sod when S. mutans was cocultured with S. sanguinis. Culturing of the dpr or sod mutant with S. sanguinis showed a significant decrease in the S. mutans population ratio compared with the wild type, while the perR mutant increased the ratio. Our results suggest that dpr and sod in S. mutans are involved in coexistence with S. sanguinis, and PerR is associated with resistance to H(2)O(2) in regulating the expression of Dpr.
TI  - Can salivary activity predict periodontal breakdown in A. actinomycetemcomitans infected adolescents?
AB  - OBJECTIVE: While Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) is highly associated  with localised aggressive periodontitis (LAP) many Aa-carriers do not develop LAP. This study was designed to determine whether specific salivary factors could distinguish between subjects who have Aa initially and remain healthy (H/AA) as compared to those who develop LAP (LAP/AA). DESIGN: H/AA subjects and healthy controls with no Aa (H) were enrolled in a longitudinal cohort study to investigate initiation of bone loss (LAP) over 3 years. After detection of LAP, stored saliva from 10 H, 10 H/AA, and 10 LAP/AA subjects was thawed, processed, and tested for (1) lactoferrin (Lf) concentration and iron levels; (2) agglutination of Aa; (3) killing of Gram-positive bacteria. RESULTS: LAP/AA saliva levels of Lf iron were low prior to and after bone loss (3.6+1.7ngFe/mug) (LAP/AA vs. H and H/AA p</=0.01). Saliva from H/AA subjects caused Aa to agglutinate significantly more than H or LAP/AA saliva (p</=0.01). LAP/AA saliva killed Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis and Lactobacillus in vitro by >83%. Saliva from H individuals killed these bacteria by <3.3% (LAP/AA vs. H; p</=0.01). H/AA killing was intermediate. CONCLUSION: LAP/AA saliva showed: low levels of Lf iron, minimal Aa agglutinating activity, and high killing activity against Gram-positive bacteria. Aa-positive healthy saliva (H/AA) showed: higher levels of Lf iron, maximal Aa agglutinating activity, and moderate killing of Gram-positive bacteria. A salivary activity profile can distinguish between subjects who are Aa-positive and remain healthy from those who develop LAP.
TI  - Divalent cations enhance fluoride binding to Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguinis cells and subsequently inhibit bacterial acid production.
AB  - One preventive effect of topical fluoride application is derived from the fact that fluoride can inhibit bacterial acid production. Furthermore, divalent cations such as Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) increase the binding of fluoride to bacterial cells. These findings suggest that exposure of oral bacteria to fluoride in the presence of divalent cations increases fluoride binding to bacterial cells and subsequently enhances fluoride-induced inhibition of bacterial acid production. This study investigated the effects of fluoride exposure (0-20,000 ppm F) in the presence of Ca(2+) or Mg(2+) prior to glucose challenge on pH fall ability by bacterial sugar fermentation, as well as fluoride binding to bacterial cells by exposure to fluoride, and fluoride release from bacterial cells during bacterial sugar fermentation, using caries-related bacteria, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguinis. The pH fall by both streptococci was inhibited by exposure to over 250 ppm F in the presence of Ca(2+) (p < 0.01), whereas in the presence of Mg(2+), the pH fall by S. mutans and S. sanguinis was inhibited after exposure to over 250 and 950 ppm F, respectively (p < 0.05). The amounts of fluoride binding to and released from streptococcal cells increased with the concentration of fluoride the cells were exposed to in the presence of Mg(2+), but were high enough even after 250 ppm F exposure in the presence of Ca(2+). The enhanced inhibition of acid production in the presence of divalent cations is probably due to the improved efficiency of fluoride binding to bacterial cells being improved via these divalent cations.
TI  - Beyond Streptococcus mutans: dental caries onset linked to multiple species by 16S rRNA community analysis.
AB  - Dental caries in very young children may be severe, result in serious infection,  and require general anesthesia for treatment. Dental caries results from a shift within the biofilm community specific to the tooth surface, and acidogenic species are responsible for caries. Streptococcus mutans, the most common acid producer in caries, is not always present and occurs as part of a complex microbial community. Understanding the degree to which multiple acidogenic species provide functional redundancy and resilience to caries-associated communities will be important for developing biologic interventions. In addition, microbial community interactions in health and caries pathogenesis are not well understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate bacterial community profiles associated with the onset of caries in the primary dentition. In a combination cross-sectional and longitudinal design, bacterial community profiles at progressive stages of caries and over time were examined and compared to those of health. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used for bacterial community analysis. Streptococcus mutans was the dominant species in many, but not all, subjects with caries. Elevated levels of S. salivarius, S. sobrinus, and S. parasanguinis were also associated with caries, especially in subjects with no or low levels of S. mutans, suggesting these species are alternative pathogens, and that multiple species may need to be targeted for interventions. Veillonella, which metabolizes lactate, was associated with caries and was highly correlated with total acid producing species. Among children without previous history of caries, Veillonella, but not S. mutans or other acid-producing species, predicted future caries. Bacterial community diversity was reduced in caries as compared to health, as many species appeared to occur at lower levels or be lost as caries advanced, including the Streptococcus mitis group, Neisseria, and Streptococcus sanguinis. This may have implications for bacterial community resilience and the restoration of oral health.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of different self-etch adhesives.
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the antimicrobial activity of different self-etch adhesives by means of the agar disc diffusion test. METHODS: Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mutans strains were selected to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of various self-etch adhesives (Futurabond NR, G-aenial Bond, Adper Easy Bond Self-Etch Adhesive, Clearfil Protect Bond, One Coat 7.0, Clearfil S3 Bond, Clearfil SE Bond) using the agar disc diffusion test; 0.2% Chlorexidine digluconate was used as control. Paper disks were saturated with 10 microL of each adhesive system and placed onto culture agar plates pre-adsorbed with bacterial cells and further incubated for 24 h at 37 degrees C. The growth inhibition zones around each adhesive were recorded and compared for each bacterial strain. RESULTS: The test results of the various self-etch adhesives were significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present investigation showed that the addition of MDPB monomer to an adhesive system enhances its antibacterial effect against S. salivarius, S. sanguis and S. mutans.
TI  - Evaluation of bacterial adhesion on machined titanium, Osseotite(R) and Nanotite(R) discs.
AB  - PURPOSE: Bacterial adhesion and colonization play a crucial function in the pathogenesis of peri-implant tissue infection, which is considered the main cause of fixture loss. The aim of this study is to evaluate the differences in bacterial adhesion between a machined titanium surface, a double acid etched surface (Osseotite(R)) and an Osseotite surface with Nanometer-scale Discrete Crystalline Deposition (DCD) of calcium phosphate (CaP)(Nanotite(R)). METHODS: Surface roughness properties of each sample were determined by a laser profilometer and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation. Bacterial adhesion on machined, Osseotite(R), and Nanotite(R) discs were performed using the following bacterial strains: Streptococcus mutans CCUG 35176, Streptococcus sanguis CCUG 17826, Streptococcus salivarius CCUG 11878, Actinobacillus actinomycetecomitans CCUG 37002, Porphyromonas gingivalis CCUG 2521. The assessment of bacterial adhesion was performed by comparing two methods: Total Viable Count (TVC) estimation and Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopic (CSLM) studies. RESULTS: The surface roughness parameter increased as follows: machined<Nanotite(R)<Osseotite(R). The attachment of all bacterial strains performed by both methods showed a significant reduction on Osseotite(R) and even higher on Nanotite(R) in comparison to machined surfaces (p<0.05). The reduction in bacterial attachment was more significant on Osseotite(R) and Nanotite(R) for A. actinomycetecomitans, S. mutans and S. sanguis than for P. gingivalis and S. salivarius strains. CONCLUSIONS: Nanotite(R) samples showed the lowest amount of bacterial contamination in comparison to the smoother machined and rougher Osseotite(R) surfaces.
TI  - Contact-killing of adhering streptococci by a quaternary ammonium compound incorporated in an acrylic resin.
AB  - PURPOSE: Acrylates for bonding of joint prostheses and stainless-steel brackets in orthopedics and orthodontics are prone to bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation, respectively, leading to serious infectious complications. Here we describe the preparation of a contact-killing acrylic resin by incorporation of [3-(methacryloylamino)propyl] trimethylammonium chloride (MAPTAC). METHODS: Physicochemical properties of the acrylates with and without MAPTAC incorporated were determined with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and water contact angles. The bond-strength of the acrylate with different percentages of MAPTAC was determined in a shear mode. The efficacy in contact-killing of the acrylate with MAPTAC incorporated with and without an adsorbed salivary coating was evaluated for various oral streptococcal strains. Cytotoxicity was tested against human skin fibroblasts. RESULTS: Acrylates with 16 wt% and 20 wt% incorporated MAPTAC showed strong contact-killing of various oral streptococcal strains up to challenge concentrations of 109 mL-1 within 15 min, with no elution of antimicrobial polymers. Contact-killing reduced after coating with a salivary conditioning film, but still remained significant up to a challenge concentration of 105 mL-1. No cytotoxicity of acrylate with incorporated MAPTAC was observed toward human skin fibroblasts. The bond strengths of stainless-steel brackets fixed to etched enamel through the resin (12 +/- 3 MPa) decreased with increasing amounts MAPTAC to half of the original value when 20 wt% of MAPTAC was incorporated, which remained within a clinically acceptable range. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that MAPTAC can be effectively incorporated in orthodontic resin to provide long-term bactericidal activity against oral bacteria, with potential application in orthopedics.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of various antibiotics against oral streptococci isolated  in the oral cavity.
AB  - A total of 550 oral streptococci: 270 Streptococcus mitis, 110 Streptococcus sanguis, 90 Streptococcus anginosus, 50 Streptococcus mutans, 30 Streptococcus salivarius, were isolated from dental plaque and gengival crevices of patients and tested for their susceptibility to 12 beta-lactam antibiotics and to 5 non-beta-lactam antibiotics, using the microdiluition method. Overall, a reduced susceptibility to penicillin was recorded in 13.4% of cases. The percentage of strains resistant to penicillin appeared significantly higher in S. mitis (24%) than in S. sanguis (19%), in S. mutans (14%) and in S. salivarius (10%). No levels of penicillin resistance were shown by 90 strains of S. anginosus. In susceptibility test to antibiotics, imipenem was the most active molecule tested, confirming its general good activity against oral streptococci. Also third generation cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone and fourth generation cephalosporins such as cefepime, showed good activity. Chinolones, glycopeptides and rifampicin confirmed a good activity against oral streptococci.
TI  - Factors related to maternal transmission of mutans streptococci in high-risk children-pilot study.
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate virulence factors associated with maternal transmission of mutans streptococci (MS). METHODS: Saliva samples were collected from 10 mothers with active caries and their 2- to 5-year-old children. Ten MS colonies were isolated from each subject. Transmission of MS was identified by arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reactions. Biofilm formation and mutacin production of the isolates against Streptococcus gordonii 10558, Streptococcus sanguinis 10557, Streptococcus mutans 25175, and Streptococcus sobrinus 6715 were analyzed. RESULTS: All mothers and children had MS colonization. Only 7 of the 36 maternal genotypes (33 Streptococcus mutans genotypes and 3 Streptococcus sobrinus genotypes) were transmitted. Maternal transmission was found in 4 mother-child pairs, whereas 9 children had nonmaternal genotypes. There was no difference in biofilm formation between transmitted and nontransmitted genotypes (P>.05). Transmitted genotypes, however, produced more mutacin against Streptococcus sobrinus 6715 than nontransmitted genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study showed that there may be nonmaternal as well as maternal mutans streptococci transmission.
TI  - Effect of xylitol on cariogenic and beneficial oral streptococci: a randomized, double-blind crossover trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Although habitual consumption of xylitol reduces cariogenic streptococci levels, its effect on beneficial oral streptococci is less clear. The main aim of the study is to investigate the effect of short-term xylitol consumption on the oral beneficial streptococci level of saliva, Streptococcus sanguinis and S. mitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty four volunteers with a median age of 23.7 years (range: 20-28) harboring Streptococcus mutans, S. sobrinus, S. sanguinis and S. mitis participated in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. The experimental chewing gum (1.5 g/pellet) contained 70% xylitol w/w while the control gum contained 63% sorbitol w/w. Saliva samples were collected before and after two three-week test periods with a four-week washout interval. Colony-forming units (CFU)/ml were enumerated for the estimation of S. mutans levels on Mitis Salivarius-Mutans valinomycin (MS-MUTV), S. sobrinus on Mitis Salivarius-Sobrinus (MS-SOB), S. sanguinis on Modified Medium 10-Sucrose (MM10-S) and S. mitis on Mitis Salivarius Agar with Tellurite (MSAT) media. RESULTS: The S. mutans and S. sobrinus counts of the saliva samples decreased significantly (p = 0.01 and p = 0.011, respectively) in the xylitol gum group but not in the sorbitol gum group. The salivary S. sanguinis and S. mitis counts did not decrease in both xylitol and sorbitol gum groups. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the findings of this study, xylitol consumption reduced S. mutans and S. sobrinus counts in saliva but appeared not to effect numbers of S. sanguinis and S. mitis in saliva. So, habitual consumption of xylitol reduces cariogenic streptococci levels without any effect on beneficial sterptococci for the oral cavity.
TI  - Oral microbial profile discriminates breast-fed from formula-fed infants.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Little is known about the effect of diet on the oral microbiota of infants, although diet is known to affect the gut microbiota. The aims of the present study were to compare the oral microbiota in breast-fed and formula-fed infants, and investigate growth inhibition of streptococci by infant-isolated lactobacilli. METHODS: A total of 207 mothers consented to participation of their 3-month-old infants. A total of 146 (70.5%) infants were exclusively and 38 (18.4%) partially breast-fed, and 23 (11.1%) were exclusively formula-fed. Saliva from all of their infants was cultured for Lactobacillus species, with isolate identifications from 21 infants. Lactobacillus isolates were tested for their ability to suppress Streptococcus mutans and S sanguinis. Oral swabs from 73 infants were analysed by the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM) and by quantitative polymerase chain reaction for Lactobacillus gasseri. RESULTS: Lactobacilli were cultured from 27.8% of exclusively and partially breast-fed infants, but not from formula-fed infants. The prevalence of 14 HOMIM-detected taxa, and total salivary lactobacilli counts differed by feeding method. Multivariate modelling of HOMIM-detected bacteria and possible confounders clustered samples from breast-fed infants separately from formula-fed infants. The microbiota of breast-fed infants differed based on vaginal or C-section delivery. Isolates of L plantarum, L gasseri, and L vaginalis inhibited growth of the cariogenic S mutans and the commensal S sanguinis: L plantarum >L gasseri >L vaginalis. CONCLUSIONS: The microbiota of the mouth differs between 3-month-old breast-fed and formula-fed infants. Possible mechanisms for microbial differences observed include species suppression by lactobacilli indigenous to breast milk.
TI  - Comparison of oral streptococci biofilm in caries-free and caries-affected preschool Mexican children.
AB  - Interaction of oral streptococci biofilm is the main etiological factor for dental caries. The aim of the study was to compare oral streptococci (OS) distribution in the biofilm of primary dentition from caries-free and caries-affected preschool Mexican children. This cross-sectional study involved 40 caries-free and 40 caries-affected children with primary dentition. Each child was examined using the dmfs index, DNA was extracted from saliva and presence of OS was determined by PCR. Data obtained showed no statistical difference regarding age and gender (P > 0.05). Streptococcus mutans (Smut), Streptococcus sobrinus (Ssob) and their combination showed significant statistical differences between groups (P < 0.05). Smut, Streptococcus sanguinis and Streptococcus gordonii had an inverse relation with dmfs index and Ssob had a direct relation similar to combined with Smut. Smut-Ssob combined with other OS showed statistical differences (P < 0.05). In free-caries group Streptococcus gordonii was more frequently identified than Smut. The ratio Smut/Streptococcus sanguinis could represent a high risk of dental caries development; this ratio was higher in the caries-affected (1.18) than in the caries-free group (0.32). In conclusion, OS play an important role in dental caries predisposition and severity, not only the presence of Smut and Srob, but also the complexity and distribution of OS in the biofilm.
TI  - UV-C-irradiation sublethal stress does not alter antibiotic susceptibility of the viridans group streptococci to beta-lactam, macrolide, and fluoroquinolone antibiotic agents.
AB  - AIM: Previous work has indicated that environmental stresses on bacteria might lead to an upregulation of stress response. LED curing lights (315-400 nm) and other UV lights used in tooth whitening cosmetic procedures might act as stresses. We examined the effect of UV-C light, as a high-energy surrogate to the lower-energy UV-A light used in such instruments, to examine its effect on the antibiotic susceptibility of viridans group streptococci. METHODS: Twelve species of viridans group streptococci were examined in this study: Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus australis, Streptococcus cristatus, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus infantis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus parasanguinis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus salivarius, and Streptococcus sanguinis. These organisms were exposed to varying degrees of sublethal UV-C radiation, and their minimum inhibitory concentration susceptibility was determined by broth dilution assay against three classes of commonly-used antibiotics: beta-lactams (penicillin), macrolides (erythromycin), and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin). RESULTS: There was no significant difference between antibiotic susceptibility before UV-C exposure and following maximum sublethal stress, prior to cell death due to fatal UV-C exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to UV-C light will not result in altered antibiotic susceptibility patterns on viridans group streptococci. Given that UV-C is more toxic and mutagenic than UV-A light, it is unlikely than UV-A light would yield any difference in response to such exposure.
TI  - Photodynamic inactivation of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguinis biofilms in vitro.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate specific effects of photodynamic inactivation (PDI) using erythrosine (ER) and Rose Bengal (RB) photosensitizers and a blue light-emitting diode (LED) on the viability of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguinis biofilms. Biofilms were grown in acrylic disks immersed in broth to production of biofilms, inoculated with microbial suspension (10(6) cells/mL) and incubated for 48 h. After the formation of biofilms, the effects of the photosensitizers ER and RB at a concentration of 5 muM for 5 min and blue LED (455 +/- 20 nm) for 180 s, photosensitizers alone and conjugated were evaluated. Next, the disks were placed in tubes with sterile physiological solution (0.9 % sodium chloride) and sonicated for to disperse the biofilms. Tenfold serial dilutions were carried and aliquots seeded in brain heart infusion agar which were then incubated for 48 h. Then the numbers colony-forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL; log10) were counted and analyzed statistically (ANOVA, Tukey test, P </= 0.05). Significant decreases in the viability of all microorganisms were observed for biofilms exposed to PDI mediated by both photosensitizers. The reductions with RB and ER were, 0.62 and 0.52 log10 CFU mL(-1) for S. mutans biofilms (p=0.001), and 0.95 and 0.88 log10 CFU mL(-1) for S. sanguinis biofilms (p=0.001), respectively. The results showed that biofilms formed in vitro by S. mutans and S. sanguinis, were sensitive to PDI using a blue LED associated with photosensitizers ER or RB, indicating its use in the control of caries and periodontal diseases.
TI  - White-spot lesions and gingivitis microbiotas in orthodontic patients.
AB  - White-spot lesions (WSL) associated with orthodontic appliances are a cosmetic problem and increase risk for cavities. We characterized the microbiota of WSL, accounting for confounding due to gingivitis. Participants were 60 children with fixed appliances, aged between 10 and 19 yrs, half with WSL. Plaque samples were assayed by a 16S rRNA-based microarray (HOMIM) and by PCR. Mean gingival index was positively associated with WSL (p = 0.018). Taxa associated with WSL by microarray included Granulicatella elegans (p = 0.01), Veillonellaceae sp. HOT 155 (p < 0.01), and Bifidobacterium Cluster 1 (p = 0.11), and by qPCR, Streptococcus mutans (p = 0.008) and Scardovia wiggsiae (p = 0.04) Taxa associated with gingivitis by microarray included: Gemella sanguinis (p = 0.002), Actinomyces sp. HOT 448 (p = 0.003), Prevotella cluster IV (p = 0.021), and Streptococcus sp. HOT 071/070 (p = 0.023); and levels of S. mutans (p = 0.02) and Bifidobacteriaceae (p = 0.012) by qPCR. Species' associations with WSL were minimally changed with adjustment for gingivitis level. Partial least-squares discriminant analysis yielded good discrimination between children with and those without WSL. Granulicatella, Veillonellaceae and Bifidobacteriaceae, in addition to S. mutans and S. wiggsiae, were associated with the presence of WSL in adolescents undergoing orthodontic treatment. Many taxa showed a stronger association with gingivitis than with WSL.
TI  - Raman microspectroscopy for species identification and mapping within bacterial biofilms.
AB  - : A new method of mapping multiple species of oral bacteria in intact biofilms has been developed, using the optical technique of confocal Raman microscopy. A species classification algorithm, developed on dried biofilms, was used to analyze spectra of hydrated biofilms containing two microbial species central to dental health: Streptococcus sanguinis and Streptococcus mutans. The algorithm transferred successfully to the hydrated environment, correctly identifying the species of origin of single-species biofilms. We then used the algorithm successfully both to detect the presence of two species in mixed biofilms and to create spatial maps within these biofilms.
TI  - SpxA1 involved in hydrogen peroxide production, stress tolerance and endocarditis virulence in Streptococcus sanguinis.
AB  - Streptococcus sanguinis is one of the most common agents of infective endocarditis. Spx proteins are a group of global regulators that negatively or positively control global transcription initiation. In this study, we characterized the spxA1 gene in S. sanguinis SK36. The spxA1 null mutant displayed opaque colony morphology, reduced hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) production, and reduced antagonistic activity against Streptococcus mutans UA159 relative to the wild type strain. The DeltaspxA1 mutant also demonstrated decreased tolerance to high temperature, acidic and oxidative stresses. Further analysis revealed that DeltaspxA1 also exhibited a approximately 5-fold reduction in competitiveness in an animal model of endocarditis. Microarray studies indicated that expression of several oxidative stress genes was downregulated in the DeltaspxA1 mutant. The expression of spxB and nox was significantly decreased in the DeltaspxA1 mutant compared with the wild type. These results indicate that spxA1 plays a major role in H(2)O(2) production, stress tolerance and endocarditis virulence in S. sanguinis SK36. The second spx gene, spxA2, was also found in S. sanguinis SK36. The spxA2 null mutant was found to be defective for growth under normal conditions and showed sensitivity to high temperature, acidic and oxidative stresses.
TI  - Shifts in the microbial population in relation to in situ caries progression.
AB  - The shift in microbial diversity from young to mature plaque, related to caries activity on sound and restored surfaces, was studied using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. During a 20-week in situ study on caries progression 8 subjects wearing restored and unrestored dentin and enamel sections, biofilm was sampled after 1 and 20 weeks (young or mature plaque). A higher microbial diversity (mature plaque) was seen in caries-active compared to caries-free subjects. Rothia dentocariosa and Scardovia inopinata were absent from all caries-free sites, but appeared in 50% of the caries-active sites.
TI  - Phenotypic and genotypic characterization of Thai oral streptococci, lactobacilli and pediococci.
AB  - This work was to assess the isolation and identification of Thai oral bacteria. Seventeen viridans group streptococci (VGS) and seventeen lactic acid bacteria from saliva were characterization based on their morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics and the 16S RNA gene sequences analysis. The Gram-positive cocci in chains of viridans group comprised of six isolates (Group I) were identified as Streptococcus gordonii, 6 isolates (Group II) were Streptococcus salivarius, 4 isolates (Group III) were Streptococcus sanguis and one isolate (Group IV) was Streptococcus mutans. Seventeen lactic acid bacterial isolates were Gram-positive and catalase negative. They did not contained diaminopimelic acid in the cell wall peptidoglycan. They were divided into four groups, the rod-shaped in Group A (11 isolates) and Group B (2 isolates) which were identified as Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus salivarius, respectively. The tetrad-forming cocci in Group C (3 isolates) and Group D (1 isolate) were identified as Pediococcus acidilactici and P. pentosaceus, respectively.
TI  - Effects of xylitol on xylitol-sensitive versus xylitol-resistant Streptococcus mutans strains in a three-species in vitro biofilm.
AB  - We studied the effects of xylitol on biofilms containing xylitol-resistant (Xr) and xylitol-sensitive (Xs) Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces naeslundii and S. sanguinis. The biofilms were grown for 8 and 24 h on hydroxyapatite discs. The viable microorganisms were determined by plate culturing techniques and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed using a S. mutans-specific probe. Extracellular cell-bound polysaccharides (EPS) were determined by spectrofluorometry from single-species S. mutans biofilms. In the presence of 5 % xylitol, the counts of the Xs S. mutans decreased tenfold in the young (8 h) biofilm (p < 0.05) but no effect was seen in the mature (24 h) biofilm. No decrease was observed for the Xr strains, and FISH confirmed these results. No differences were detected in the EPS production of the Xs S. mutans grown with or without xylitol, nor between Xr and Xs S. mutans strains. Thus, it seems that xylitol did not affect the EPS synthesis of the S. mutans strains. Since the Xr S. mutans strains, not inhibited by xylitol, showed no xylitol-induced decrease in the biofilms, we conclude that growth inhibition could be responsible for the decrease of the counts of the Xs S. mutans strains in the clinically relevant young biofilms.
TI  - Influence of orthodontic treatment on oral streptococci.
AB  - Objective of this study is to evaluate the changes of the oral microbial flora, concentrating on the oral streptococci, after the first 3 and 6 months of orthodontic treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 40 patients, aged 7-17, that presented for orthodontic treatment between April and September 2010 in the Department of Orthodontics and Dento-Facial Orthopedics of "Carol Davila" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest have been selected. According to the protocol, coronary and subgingival plaque was collected from the dental surface before starting any orthodontic treatment (T0), 3 months after wearing orthodontic appliances (T1) and 6 months after wearing orthodontic appliances (T2). The samples were studied in Cantacuzino National Institute of Research-Development for Microbiology and Immunology [isolation on Columbia agar with 5% sheep blood, identification on morphotinctorial, growth and biochemical characteristics using API 20 STREP (BioMerieux)]. Bacterial concentration (colony-forming units/sample = CFU/sample) for the aerobic and anaerobic flora was calculated by the serial dilution method of counting bacteria. RESULTS: 106 strains of oral streptococci were isolated from dental plaque, belonging to 6 species (Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus acidominimus), 37 strains of oral streptococci in patients from group I (T0), 40 strains from group II (T1) and 29 strains of oral streptococci from group III (T2). After 3 months (T1) the aerobic bacteria percentage, detected at a concentration between 10(5) and 10(6), increased from 30 to 38.2%. The percentage of patients with a bacterial concentration higher than 10(6) CFU/sample increased from 5% to 8.8%. The samples colected at T2 (patients examined after 6 months of orthodonic treatment) presented a lower bacterial concentration, as compared to group II (T1). The most common isolated species of streptococci were S. salivarius, S. oralis and S. mutans (37.5%, 22.5% and 10%), whose frequency increased after 3 months of treatment to 41.14%, 32.3% and respectively 14.4%, returning after 6 months of treatment at values similar to those recorded before beginning the orthodontic treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Presence of orthodontic appliances may produce a transitory increase of bacterial concentration (CFU/sample) and isolation rate of oral streptococci, returning to the level prior to the application of these devices after a time interval of several months.
TI  - Comparison of microbial changes in early redeveloping biofilms on natural teeth and dentures.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surfaces and fluids can affect oral bacterial colonization. The aim of this study is to compare redeveloping biofilms on natural teeth and dentures. METHODS: Supragingival plaque samples were taken from 55 dentate individuals and the denture teeth of 62 edentulous individuals before and after professional cleaning. Also, samples from seven "teeth" (samples included dentures) in randomly selected quadrants were collected after 1, 2, 4, and 7 days of no oral hygiene. Samples were analyzed using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Counts and proportions of 41 bacterial taxa were determined at each time point, and significant differences were determined using the Mann-Whitney U test. Ecological succession was determined using a modified moving window analysis. RESULTS: Mean total DNA probe counts were similar precleaning but were higher in dentate individuals at all post-cleaning visits (P <0.01). Precleaning edentate biofilms had higher counts and proportions of Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus mutans, whereas dentate individuals had higher proportions of Tannerella forsythia, Selenomonas noxia, and Neisseria mucosa. By day 2, mean counts of all taxa were higher in natural teeth, and most remained higher at day 7 (P <0.01). Succession was more rapid and complex in dentate individuals. Both groups demonstrated increased proportions of S. mitis and S. oralis by day 1. N. mucosa, Veillonella parvula, and Eikenella corrodens increased in both groups, but later in samples from edentate individuals. CONCLUSIONS: "Mature" natural and denture teeth biofilms have similar total numbers of bacteria but different species proportions. Post-cleaning biofilm redevelopment is more rapid and more complex on natural teeth than on denture teeth.
TI  - Genome-wide essential gene identification in Streptococcus sanguinis.
AB  - A clear perception of gene essentiality in bacterial pathogens is pivotal for identifying drug targets to combat emergence of new pathogens and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, for synthetic biology, and for understanding the origins of life. We have constructed a comprehensive set of deletion mutants and systematically identified a clearly defined set of essential genes for Streptococcus sanguinis. Our results were confirmed by growing S. sanguinis in minimal medium and by double-knockout of paralogous or isozyme genes. Careful examination revealed that these essential genes were associated with only three basic categories of biological functions: maintenance of the cell envelope, energy production, and processing of genetic information. Our finding was subsequently validated in two other pathogenic streptococcal species, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus mutans and in two other gram-positive pathogens, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus. Our analysis has thus led to a simplified model that permits reliable prediction of gene essentiality.
TI  - A comparative evaluation of the antibacterial efficacy of honey in vitro and antiplaque efficacy in a 4-day plaque regrowth model in vivo: preliminary results.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Honey has a potent broad-spectrum antibacterial action that may make  it suitable for "anti-infective" treatment of periodontal disease. The aims of this study are as follows: 1) to evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of honey against oral bacteria and compare the same with 0.2% chlorhexidine; and 2) to compare antiplaque efficacy in vivo with chlorhexidine. METHODS: The study was conducted in two parts. In the in vitro part, the inhibitory effects of three test agents, 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate, honey mouthwash, and saline, against six oral bacteria at concentrations of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, and 512 mug/mL were tested in duplicate. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was set as the lowest concentration of the agent that completely inhibited the growth of the test species. The in vivo part consisted of a double-masked parallel clinical trial based on a 4-day plaque regrowth model. Sixty-six volunteers, 20 to 24 years of age, participated in the study, and the plaque scores were compared at baseline and at the end of 4 days. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used for significance, and the Mann-Whitney U test was used for pairwise comparison of the groups. The mean plaque scores were 1.77 +/- 0.86, 1.64 +/- 0.90, and 3.27 +/- 0.83 for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. RESULTS: The honey mouthrinse effectively inhibited the six tested microorganisms. The chlorhexidine gluconate rinse had the lowest MICs compared with honey and saline rinses for all test species examined. The in vivo results revealed that plaque formation was inhibited/reduced by chlorhexidine and honey rinses. CONCLUSION: Honey has antibacterial action against tested oral microorganisms and also has antiplaque action.
TI  - The cariogenic characters of xylitol-resistant and xylitol-sensitive Streptococcus mutans in biofilm formation with salivary bacteria.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans metabolize carbohydrates, such as glucose and sucrose, to produce acid and enhance biofilm formation with the early colonizing bacteria to induce dental caries. Xylitol has been used as a reliable substitute for carbohydrate to inhibit the acid production of S. mutans. However, long-term xylitol consumption leads to the emergence of xylitol-resistance in S. mutans. The aim of this study was to investigate the cariogenic trait of Xylitol-resistant (X(R)) S. mutans using biofilm formation and coaggregation of xylitol-sensitive (X(S)) and X(R) S. mutans with salivary bacteria and their glucosyltransferases expression. When X(S) or X(R) S. mutans were incubated in brain heart infusion broth with bacteria from human saliva, X(R)S. mutans exhibited reduction in biofilm formation in comparison to X(S) S. mutans. The coaggregation between X(R) S. mutans and S, gordonii, S. mitis, S. oralis or S. sanguinis was less pronounced than that of X(S) S. mutans in the presence of sucrose. However, there was no difference in the coaggregation between X(R) and X(S) S. mutans in the sucrose-free condition. The level of gtfB and gtfC mRNA expression of X(R) S. mutans was lower than that of X(S) S. mutans, whilst the level of gtfD mRNA expression did not differ between the two strains. The reduction of biofilm formation in X(S) S. mutans due to decrease in glucosyltransferases expression suggests that X(R) S. mutans may be less cariogenic than X(S) S. mutans.
TI  - A five-species transcriptome array for oral mixed-biofilm studies.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oral polymicrobial interactions and biofilm formation are associated  with initiation and progression of caries, gingivitis, and periodontitis. Transcriptome studies of such interactions, allowing a first mechanistic insight, are hampered by current single-species array designs. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study we used 385 K NimbleGene technology for design and evaluation of an array covering the full genomes of 5 important physiological-, cariogenic-, and periodontitis-associated microorganisms (Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mutans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and Porphyromonas gingivalis). Array hybridization was done with cDNA from cultures grown for 24 h anaerobically. Single species experiments identified cross-species hybridizing array probes. These probes could be neglected in a mixed-species experimental setting without the need to exclude the whole genes from the analysis. Between 69% and almost 99% of the genomes were actively transcribed under the mono-species planktonic, monolayer, and biofilm conditions. The influence of Streptococcus mitis (not represented on the array) on S. mutans gene transcription was determined as a test for a dual-species mixed biofilm setup. Phenotypically, under the influence of S. mitis an increase in S. mutans biofilm mass and a decrease in media pH-value were noticed, thereby confirming previously published data. Employing a stringent cut-off (2-fold, p<0.05), 19 S. mutans transcripts were identified with increased abundance, and 11 with decreased abundance compared to a S. mutans mono-species biofilm. Several of these genes have previously been found differentially regulated under general and acid stress, thereby confirming the value of this array. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This new array allows transcriptome studies on multi-species oral biofilm interactions. It may become an important asset in future oral biofilm and inhibitor/therapy studies.

TI  - Antimicrobial and antibiofilm action of Casbane Diterpene from Croton nepetaefolius against oral bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The antibacterial activity of Casbane Diterpene (CD) was evaluated in  vitro against Streptococcus oralis, S. mutans, S. salivarius, S. sobrinus, S. mitis and S. sanguinis. The viability of planktonic cells was analysed by susceptibility tests (MIC and MBC) and antibiofilm action was assayed. METHODS: The minimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations (MIC and MBC) of oral Streptococcus were evaluated through microdilution tests. To assay antibiofilm activity, biofilms were generated on 96-wells polystyrene plates under the presence of CD and quantified by a crystal violet technique and colonies forming units counting. RESULTS: The CD isolated from Croton nepetaefolius showed antimicrobial effect on planktonic forms and biofilms of oral pathogens, with MIC values of 62.5 mug/mL against Streptococcus oralis and values between 125 and 500 mug/mL against S. mutans, S. salivarius, S. sobrinus, S. mitis and S. sanguinis. CD showed an inhibitory effect on S. mutans biofilm formation at 250 mug/mL, and a decrease on viable cell of 94.28% compared to the normal biofilm growth. CONCLUSIONS: The compound CD can be considered as a promising molecule for the treatment against oral pathogens responsible for dental biofilm.
TI  - Photoactivated disinfection (PAD) in endodontics: an in vitro microbiological evaluation.
AB  - PURPOSE: The objective of the present study was the in vitro evaluation by MTT test of the antimicrobial effect of photoactivated disinfection (PAD) and, comparatively, of a conventional 5.25% NaOCl irrigating solution. METHODS: Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis strains were selected for the test. Freshly extracted single-rooted human teeth were endodontically treated, inoculated with bacterial strains and then divided into different groups, each of them treated with PAD, with PAD plus 0.5% NaOCl solution, with TBO, with PAD for longer time and with 5% NaOCl solution (positive control). RESULTS: The results were significantly different among the various groups, and for Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis. PAD applied for a longer time (in respect to manufacturer's instructions) or PAD associated to 5% NaOCl showed the significantly higher antibacterial effects.
TI  - Effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation between oral streptococci and Actinomyces naeslundii.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The co-aggregation of oral bacteria leads to their clearance from the oral cavity. Poor oral hygiene and high saliva viscosity are common amongst the elderly; thus, they frequently suffer from pneumonia caused by the aspiration of oral microorganisms. OBJECTIVES: To examine the direct effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen oral streptococcal and a single actinomyces strain were used. Co-aggregation was assessed by a visual assay in phosphate buffer and a spectrophotometric assay in the same buffer containing 0-60% glycerol or whole saliva. RESULTS: Nine oral streptococci co-aggregated with Actinomyces naeslundii ATCC12104 in the visual assay and were subsequently used for the spectrophotometric analysis. All tested strains displayed a decrease in co-aggregation with increasing amounts of glycerol in the buffer. The co-aggregation of Streptococcus oralis with A. naeslundii recovered to baseline level following the removal of glycerol. The per cent co-aggregation of S. oralis with A. naeslundii was significantly correlated with the viscosity in unstimulated and stimulated whole saliva samples (correlation coefficients: -0.52 and -0.48, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that saliva viscosity affects the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces and that bacterial co-aggregation decreases with increasing saliva viscosity.
TI  - The Streptococcus sanguinis competence regulon is not required for infective endocarditis virulence in a rabbit model.
AB  - Streptococcus sanguinis is an important component of dental plaque and a leading  cause of infective endocarditis. Genetic competence in S. sanguinis requires a quorum sensing system encoded by the early comCDE genes, as well as late genes controlled by the alternative sigma factor, ComX. Previous studies of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus mutans have identified functions for the >100-gene com regulon in addition to DNA uptake, including virulence. We investigated this possibility in S. sanguinis. Strains deleted for the comCDE or comX master regulatory genes were created. Using a rabbit endocarditis model in conjunction with a variety of virulence assays, we determined that both mutants possessed infectivity equivalent to that of a virulent control strain, and that measures of disease were similar in rabbits infected with each strain. These results suggest that the com regulon is not required for S. sanguinis infective endocarditis virulence in this model. We propose that the different roles of the S. sanguinis, S. pneumoniae, and S. mutans com regulons in virulence can be understood in relation to the pathogenic mechanisms employed by each species.
TI  - Synthesis, antimicrobial and antiproliferative activity of novel silver(I) tris(pyrazolyl)methanesulfonate and 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphadamantane complexes.
AB  - Five new silver(I) complexes of formulas [Ag(Tpms)] (1), [Ag(Tpms)(PPh(3))] (2),  [Ag(Tpms)(PCy(3))] (3), [Ag(PTA)][BF(4)] (4), and [Ag(Tpms)(PTA)] (5) {Tpms = tris(pyrazol-1-yl)methanesulfonate, PPh(3) = triphenylphosphane, PCy(3) = tricyclohexylphosphane, PTA = 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane} have been synthesized and fully characterized by elemental analyses, (1)H, (13)C, and (31)P NMR, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), and IR spectroscopic techniques. The single crystal X-ray diffraction study of 3 shows the Tpms ligand acting in the N(3)-facially coordinating mode, while in 2 and 5 a N(2)O-coordination is found, with the SO(3) group bonded to silver and a pendant free pyrazolyl ring. Features of the tilting in the coordinated pyrazolyl rings in these cases suggest that this inequivalence is related with the cone angles of the phosphanes. A detailed study of antimycobacterial and antiproliferative properties of all compounds has been carried out. They were screened for their in vitro antimicrobial activities against the standard strains Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29922), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Streptococcus pneumoniae (ATCC 49619), Streptococcus pyogenes (SF37), Streptococcus sanguinis (SK36), Streptococcus mutans (UA159), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), and the fungus Candida albicans (ATCC 24443). Complexes 1-5 have been found to display effective antimicrobial activity against the series of bacteria and fungi, and some of them are potential candidates for antiseptic or disinfectant drugs. Interaction of Ag complexes with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) has been studied by fluorescence spectroscopic techniques, using ethidium bromide (EB) as a fluorescence probe of DNA. The decrease in the fluorescence of DNA-EB system on addition of Ag complexes shows that the fluorescence quenching of DNA-EB complex occurs and compound 3 is particularly active. Complexes 1-5 exhibit pronounced antiproliferative activity against human malignant melanoma (A375) with an activity often higher than that of AgNO(3), which has been used as a control, following the same order of activity inhibition on DNA, i.e., 3 > 2 > 1 > 5 > AgNO(3)>> 4.
TI  - Antibacterial and antifungal activities of punica granatum peel extracts against  oral pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Punica granatum has been used for many years in folk medicine due to several purposes. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of methanolic extract of Punica granatum peel (MEPGP) against Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguinis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Actynomyces viscosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Candida albicans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this in vitro study, the mentioned oral organisms were cultured in blood agar and mueller-hinton media and then paper disks containing MEPGP at concentrations of 4 mg/ml, 8 mg/ml and 12 mg/ml were inserted on medias. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated by agar disk diffusion method. The effects of three different concentrations of MEPGP against microorganisms were compared using one-way ANOVA and Tukey tests. RESULTS: All concentrations of MEPGP had antibacterial activity against S. aureus and S. epidermidis. Only at concentration of 8 mg/ml and 12 mg/ml MEPGP was effective against L. acidophilus, S. mutans and S. salivarius. Furthermore; no concentrations of MEPGP inhibited A. viscosus and C. albicans. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that MEPGP might be used as an antibacterial agent in controlling oral infections.
TI  - The impact of three strains of oral bacteria on the surface and mechanical properties of a dental resin material.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine if three strains of bacteria could impact the mechanical or surface properties of a dental resin material. Resin material specimens were incubated at 37 degrees C in sterile saline, tryptic soy broth supplemented with sucrose (TSBS), or TSBS inoculated with Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus gordonii, or Streptococcus sanguis. The specimens were subjected to Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy before and after incubation. The flexural strength test was performed once a week for 6 weeks. Microhardness and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on specimens at 1 and 6 weeks. Differences in the area under the carbonyl peak were statistically significant for the specimens incubated in the media inoculated with either S. mutans or S. gordonii. To determine why S. sanguis did not produce changes as the other bacteria did, triethylene glycol dimethacrylate, methacrylic acid, and triethylene glycol were added to bacterial cultures at increasing concentrations. Both methacrylic acid and triethylene glycol reduced the number of colony-forming units of S. sanguis. Specimens incubated in TSBS, saline or in culture with S. sanguis demonstrated a decrease in peak stress in week 1 of the flexure strength test. SEM demonstrated that surface topology changed for those specimens incubated in culture with S. mutans or S. gordonii. The changes in surface topology demonstrated here could contribute to the secondary caries and changes in esthetic properties seen clinically with the use of resin materials in dental restorations.
TI  - Influence of hyaluronic acid on bacterial and fungal species, including clinically relevant opportunistic pathogens.
AB  - Hyaluronic acid (HA) has several clinical applications (aesthetic surgery, dermatology, orthopaedics and ophtalmology). Following recent evidence, suggesting antimicrobial and antiviral properties for HA, we investigated its effects on 15 ATCC strains, representative of clinically relevant bacterial and fungal species. The in vitro system employed allowed to assess optical density of broth cultures as a measure of microbial load in a time-dependent manner. The results showed that different microbial species and, sometimes, different strains belonging to the same species, are differently affected by HA. In particular, staphylococci, enterococci, Streptococcus mutans, two Escherichia coli strains, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida glabrata and C. parapsilosis displayed a HA dose-dependent growth inhibition; no HA effects were detected in E. coli ATCC 13768 and C. albicans; S. sanguinis was favoured by the highest HA dose. Therefore, the influence of HA on bacteria and fungi warrants further studies aimed at better establishing its relevance in clinical applications.
TI  - Bacterial and Candida albicans adhesion on different root canal filling materials and sealers.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Microbial adhesion and subsequent biofilm formation on endodontic root canal filling materials and sealers lead to survival of microorganisms in treated root canals and subsequently to endodontic treatment failures. The present study focused on initial microbial adhesion to different endodontic filling materials. METHODS: The following endodontic biomaterials were tested: AH-Plus, Tubli Seal, gutta-percha, Real Seal SE, EndoREZ, Apexit Plus, GuttaFlow, and dentin. Samples of each material were prepared. Bovine dentin samples were used as a control. The initial adhesions of salivary bacteria as well as the subsequent single species were quantified by determination of colony-forming units (CFUs) and visualized by scanning electron microscopy and confocal microscopy (CLSM): Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Candida albicans, and Prevotella nigrescens. RESULTS: Initially adherent microorganisms could be detected and microscopically visualized on each of the materials tested. Considering the values of the CFUs and the covering grade as detected by CLSM, there were significant differences among the materials. Fewer bacteria tended to adhere to Apexit Plus, whereas Real Seal SE and the widely used gutta-percha showed the highest number of adherent bacteria. This tendency was not detected for C. albicans. CONCLUSIONS: Endodontic microorganisms have a high affinity to root canal filling materials and sealers, especially to gutta-percha. Because of this high level of bacterial adhesion, subsequent biofilm formation on these materials could be suggested as leading to the persistence of microorganisms in root canals.
TI  - A novel target-specific, salt-resistant antimicrobial peptide against the cariogenic pathogen Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - In this study, we constructed and evaluated a target-specific, salt-resistant antimicrobial peptide (AMP) that selectively targeted Streptococcus mutans, a leading cariogenic pathogen. The rationale for creating such a peptide was based on the addition of a targeting domain of S. mutans ComC signaling peptide pheromone (CSP) to a killing domain consisting of a portion of the marine-derived, broad-spectrum AMP pleurocidin to generate a target-specific AMP. Here, we report the results of our assessment of such fusion peptides against S. mutans and two closely related species. The results showed that nearly 95% of S. mutans cells lost viability following exposure to fusion peptide IMB-2 (5.65 muM) for 15 min. In contrast, only 20% of S. sanguinis or S. gordonii cells were killed following the same exposure. Similar results were also observed in dual-species mixed cultures of S. mutans with S. sanguinis or S. gordonii. The peptide-guided killing was further confirmed in S. mutans biofilms and was shown to be dose dependent. An S. mutans mutant defective in the CSP receptor retained 60% survival following exposure to IMB-2, suggesting that the targeted peptide predominantly bound to the CSP receptor to mediate killing in the wild-type strain. Our work confirmed that IMB-2 retained its activity in the presence of physiological or higher salt concentrations. In particular, the fusion peptide showed a synergistic killing effect on S. mutans with a preventive dose of NaF. In addition, IMB-2 was relatively stable in the presence of saliva containing 1 mM EDTA and did not cause any hemolysis. We also found that replacement of serine-14 by histidine improved its activity at lower pH. Because of its effectiveness, salt resistance, and minimal toxicity to host cells, this novel target-specific peptide shows promise for future development as an anticaries agent.
TI  - [The antagonistic effect of the oral Streptococcus on the Saccharomyces albicans  in vitro].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antagonistic effects of three species of oral Streptococcus on the growth of oral Saccharomyces albicans in vitro. METHODS: Direct inoculation method, reverse inoculation method and mixed culture methods were respectively chosen to observe the changes of Saccharomyces albicans colony formation on the effects of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus salivarius. RESULTS: 1) No clear inhibition zone was observed in each of the groups by direct inoculation method. 2) Compared with the control groups, Saccharomyces albicans colony formation on soft agar of Streptococcus sanguis decreased significantly (P < 0.05). 3) Mixed culture method results showed that Streptococcus mutans could inhibit the growth of Saccharomyces albicans significantly at different time points (P = 0.001). 4) Under the action of bacteria culture supernatant, the count of Saccharomyces albicans in experiment groups showed statistical significance when compared with the control groups at 24, 48, 72 h (P = 0.001); The differences among the experimental groups were of no statistical significance at majority times (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus salivarius could obviously inhibit the growth of Saccharomyces albicans in vitro. However, it is still unclear that among which the inhibition effects is stronger. The antagonistic effects is weakened gradually.
TI  - Comparison of bacterial adhesion and cellular proliferation on newly developed three-dimensional scaffolds manufactured by rapid prototyping technology.
AB  - Scaffolds used in the field of tissue engineering should facilitate the adherence, spreading, and ingrowth of cells as well as prevent microbial adherence. For the first time, this study simultaneously deals with microbial and tissue cell adhesion to rapid prototyping-produced 3D-scaffolds. The cell growth of human osteosarcoma cells (CAL-72) over a time period of 3-11 days were examined on three scaffolds (PLGA, PLLA, PLLA-TCP) and compared to the adhesion of salivary microorganisms and representative germs of the oral flora (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella nigrescens, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus sanguinis). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cell proliferation measurements, and determination of the colony forming units (CFU) were performed. The cell proliferation rates on PLLA and PLLA-TCP after 3, 7, and 11 days of cultivation were higher than on PLGA. On day 3 the proliferation rates on PLLA and PLLA-TCP, and on day 5 on PLLA-TCP, proved to be significantly higher compared to that of the control (culture plate). The strain which showed the most CFUs on all of the investigated scaffolds was P. gingivalis, followed by E. faecalis. No significant CFU differences were determined examining P. gingivalis among the biomaterials. In contrast, E. faecalis was significantly more adherent to PLGA and PLLA compared to PLLA-TCP. The lowest CFU values were seen with C. albicans and P. nigrescens. Salivary born aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms adhered significantly more to PLGA compared to PLLA-TCP. These results supported by SEM point out the high potential of PLLA-TCP in the field of tissue engineering.
TI  - Microbicidal efficacy of thiocyanate hydrogen peroxide after adding lactoperoxidase under saliva loading in the quantitative suspension test.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: As shown in the quantitative suspension test adding lactoperoxidase to a thiocyanate (SCN(-)) hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) combination over the physiological saliva level has significant positive antimicrobial effects to a level of totally killing Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Candida albicans. The aim of this study was to evaluate this positive effect under human saliva loading. METHODS: The bactericidal and fungicidal effect of lactoperoxidase was evaluated in a quantitative suspension test by using two test mixtures of a 2.0% thiocyanate and 1.2% hydrogen peroxide solution, one without (Group A) and one with (Group B) lactoperoxidase under saliva loading. Following the quantitative suspension tests (EN-13727/EN-13624), the growth of surviving bacteria and fungi in a nutrient broth was measured. The exposure times were restricted to 1, 3, 5, and 15 min. All statistical analyses were carried out with SPSS 11.5. RESULTS: In the quantitative suspension test, the combination of thiocyanate and hydrogen peroxide showed relatively low antimicrobial effectiveness on S. mutans, S. sanguinis, and C. albicans in the presence of human saliva at measured time points in comparison to the mixture with lactoperoxidase, which showed a high bactericidal activity within 15 min (S. mutans and S. sanguinis) and fungicidal activity within 3 min (C. albicans). CONCLUSION: The antimicrobial effectiveness of the tested thiocyanate hydrogen peroxide combination was increased significantly by adding lactoperoxidase in the quantitative suspension test under human saliva loading.
TI  - [Can dental problems have influence on difficulties in treating paranasal sinusitis in children?].
AB  - Paranasal sinusitis is a condition that is treated by a General Practitioner and  in case it fails it requires specialistic therapy. In most cases the inflammation is connected with nasal mucosa infection. However, in older children and adolescents sinusitis caused by spreading of tooth and gingiva inflammatory process can be an essential therapeutic and diagnostic problem. It is most often connected with periapical lesions, complications following dental procedures and oroantral fistula inflammation. Inflammatory process originally concerns maxillary sinus, however, it often undergoes generalization and it affects all or most of sinuses unilaterally or bilaterally. In microbiology of odontogenic sinusitis the dominant bacteria are the bacteria typical for peridental lesions (Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mutans and anaerobic bacteria). Odontogenic sinusitis frequently causes life threatening complications that require heroic drug and surgical treatment. Therapeutic and diagnostic problems are presented in case studies of 5 children aged from 10 to 17, who are treated in Children's Otolaryngology, Audiology and Phoniatrics Clinic in Lodz. There seems to be the need to emphasize the importance of thorough examination of oral cavity in all the children suffering from sinusitis, especially unilateral sinusitis. It is so essential on account of the gravity of the problem and serious complications that accompany the conditions.
TI  - Influence of surface roughness on streptococcal adhesion forces to composite resins.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine streptococcal adhesion forces with composite resins with  different surface roughness. METHODS: Polishing and grinding were applied to obtain smooth (roughness 20 nm), moderately rough (150 nm) and rough (350 nm) surfaces of two orthodontic, light-cured composites. Adhesion forces between Streptococcus sanguinis and Streptococcus mutans and the composite surfaces were measured using atomic force microscopy in absence or presence of a salivary conditioning film. Initial adhesion forces were measured as well adhesion after 120 s of contact, as longer contact times are known to result in stronger adhesion forces ("bond-strengthening"). Surface roughness in absence and presence of salivary conditioning films were compared using ANOVA, while adhesion forces were subjected to a Weibull analysis. RESULTS: Initial adhesion forces in absence of a salivary conditioning film amounted between -0.7 and -0.9 nN for smooth composite resins and increased between -1.0 and -2.0 nN for the roughest surfaces. Streptococcal adhesion forces after bond-strengthening were significantly stronger than upon initial contact, irrespective of the composite type. Salivary conditioning films significantly decreased the surface roughness of the composites, as well as the streptococcal adhesion forces. Yet, also in the presence of a conditioning film, rougher composite surfaces exerted stronger adhesion forces, irrespective of composite type or bacterial strain. CONCLUSION: Streptococcal adhesion forces to orthodontic composite resins increase with increasing roughness of the composite surfaces. Composite surface roughness less affects adhesion forces with S. mutans than with S. sanguinis.
TI  - Effects of compounds found in Nidus Vespae on the growth and cariogenic virulence factors of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Nidus Vespae (honeycomb) is a kind of traditional Chinese medicine that has been  demonstrated to inhibit the growth and acid-production of oral cariogenic bacteria. Subsequent studies showed that the chloroform/methanol (Chl/MeOH) chemical extraction of Nidus Vespae was the most effective inhibitor of growth and acidogenicity of Streptococcus mutans. In this study, we isolated the chemical compounds of the Nidus Vespae Chl/MeOH extraction, tested their antimicrobial activity against six cariogenic bacteria and further evaluated the acid inhibition properties, anti-F-ATPase activity and anti-LDH activity against S. mutans. The isolated flavonoids, quercetin and kaempferol, inhibited the growth of bacteria (S. mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces naeslundii and Lactobacillus rhamnosus) with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 1 to 4 mg/ml and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) from 4 to 16 mg/ml. In addition, quercetin and kaempferol at sub-MIC levels significantly inhibited acidogenicity and acidurity of S. mutans cells. Treated with the test agents, the F-ATPase activity was reduced by 47.37% with 1mg/ml quercetin and by 49.66% with 0.5mg/ml kaempferol. The results showed that quercetin and kaempferol contained in Chl/MeOH extraction presented remarkably biological activity, suggesting that Nidus Vespae might be useful as a potential preventive and therapeutic agent in dental caries.
TI  - Oxygen dependent pyruvate oxidase expression and production in Streptococcus sanguinis.
AB  - The objective of this study was to characterize the oxygen dependent regulation of pyruvate oxidase (SpxB) gene expression and protein production in Streptococcus sanguinis (S. sanguinis). SpxB is responsible for the generation of growth-inhibiting amounts of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) able to antagonize cariogenic Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans). Furthermore, the ecological consequence of H2O2 production was investigated in its self-inhibiting ability towards the producing strain. Expression of spxB was determined with quantitative Real-Time RT-PCR and a fluorescent expression reporter strain. Protein abundance was investigated with FLAG epitope engineered in frame on the C-terminal end of SpxB. Self inhibition was tested with an antagonism plate assay. The expression and protein abundance decreased in cells grown under anaerobic conditions. S. sanguinis was resistant against its own produced H2O2, while cariogenic S. mutans was inhibited in its growth. The results suggest that S. sanguinis produces H2O2 as antimicrobial substance to inhibit susceptible niche competing species like S. mutans during initial biofilm formation, when oxygen availability allows for spxB expression and Spx production.
TI  - Streptococcus
AB  - The genus Streptococcus , a heterogeneous group of Gram-positive bacteria, has broad significance in medicine and industry. Various streptococci are important ecologically as part of the normal microbial flora of animals and humans; some can also cause diseases that range from subacute to acute or even chronic. Among the significant human diseases attributable to streptococci are scarlet fever, rheumatic heart disease, glomerulonephritis, and pneumococcal pneumonia. Streptococci are essential in industrial and dairy processes and as indicators of pollution. The nomenclature for streptococci, especially the nomenclature in medical use, has been based largely on serogroup identification of cell wall components rather than on species names. For several decades, interest has focused on two major species that cause severe infections: S pyogenes (group A streptococci) and S pneumoniae (pneumococci). In 1984, two members were assigned a new genus - the group D enterococcal species (which account for 98% of human enterococcal infections) became Enterococcus faecalis (the majority of human clinical isolates) and E faecium (associated with a remarkable capacity for antibiotic resistance). In recent years, increasing attention has been given to other streptococcal species, partly because innovations in serogrouping methods have led to advances in understanding the pathogenetic and epidemiologic significance of these species. A variety of cell-associated and extracellular products are produced by streptococci, but their cause-effect relationship with pathogenesis has not been defined. Some of the other medically important streptococci are S agalactiae (group B), an etiologic agent of neonatal disease; E faecalis (group D), a major cause of endocarditis, and the viridans streptococci. Particularly for the viridans streptococci, taxonomy and nomenclature are not yet fully reliable or consistent. Important members of the viridans streptococci, normal commensals, include S mutans and S sanguis (involved in dental caries), S mitis (associated with bacteremia, meningitis, periodontal disease and pneumonia), and "S milleri" (associated with suppurative infections in children and adults). There remains persistent taxonomic confusion regarding "S milleri." These and other streptococci of medical importance are listed inTable 13-1by serogroup designation, normal ecologic niche, and associated disease.
TI  - Clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  - It has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. It is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. To investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the DNA-DNA hybridization technique. Actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. Factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for T. forsythia, Campylobacter rectus, P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, P. nigrescens, Parvimonas micra, and Treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of A. oris, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Eikenella corrodens, Streptococcus intermedius, Selenomonas noxia, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Veillonella parvula. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while Fusobacterium nucleatum loaded on both. These findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.
TI  - Modeling of diffusion transport through oral biofilms with the inverse problem method.
AB  - AIM: The purpose of this study was to develop a mathematical model to quantitatively describe the passive transport of macromolecules within dental biofilms. METHODOLOGY: Fluorescently labeled dextrans with different molecular mass (3 kD, 10 kD, 40 kD, 70 kD, 2000 kD) were used as a series of diffusion probes. Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis, Actinomyces naeslundii and Fusobacterium nucleatum were used as inocula for biofilm formation. The diffusion processes of different probes through the in vitro biofilm were recorded with a confocal laser microscope. RESULTS: Mathematical function of biofilm penetration was constructed on the basis of the inverse problem method. Based on this function, not only the relationship between average concentration of steady-state and molecule weights can be analyzed, but also that between penetrative time and molecule weights. CONCLUSION: This can be used to predict the effective concentration and the penetrative time of anti-biofilm medicines that can diffuse through oral biofilm. Furthermore, an improved model for large molecule is proposed by considering the exchange time at the upper boundary of the dental biofilm.
TI  - A new small molecule specifically inhibits the cariogenic bacterium Streptococcus mutans in multispecies biofilms.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans is a major cariogenic bacterium. It has adapted to the biofilm lifestyle, which is essential for pathogenesis of dental caries. We aimed to identify small molecules that can inhibit cariogenic S. mutans and to discover lead structures that could give rise to therapeutics for dental caries. In this study, we screened a focused small-molecule library of 506 compounds. Eight small molecules which inhibited S. mutans at a concentration of 4 muM or less but did not affect cell growth or biofilm formation of commensal bacteria, represented by Streptococcus sanguinis and Streptococcus gordonii, in monospecies biofilms were identified. The active compounds share similar structural properties, which are characterized by a 2-aminoimidazole (2-AI) or 2-aminobenzimidazole (2-ABI) subunit. In multispecies biofilm models, the most active compound also inhibited cell survival and biofilm formation of S. mutans but did not affect commensal streptococci. This inhibitor downregulated the expression of six biofilm-associated genes, ftf, pac, relA, comDE, gbpB, and gtfB, in planktonic S. mutans cells, while it downregulated the expression of only ftf, pac, and relA in the biofilm cells of S. mutans. The most potent compound also inhibited production of two key adhesins of S. mutans, antigen I/II and glucosyltransferase (GTF). However, the compound did not alter the expression of the corresponding genes in both S. sanguinis and S. gordonii, indicating that it possesses a selective inhibitory activity against S. mutans.
TI  - Prunus mume extract exhibits antimicrobial activity against pathogenic oral bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Prunus mume is a common fruit in Asia, which has been used in traditional Chinese medicine. In this study, we focused on the antimicrobial properties of Prunus mume extract against oral pathogens related to dental caries and periodontal diseases. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 15 oral pathogens including Streptococcus mutans, S. sobrinus, S. mitis, S. sanguinis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, P. gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and Candida species were included in the study. Initially, agar diffusion assay was performed to screen the antimicrobial activities of Prunus mume extract. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were then determined for sensitive species. Effect of Prunus mume extract on human oral keratinocytes (HOK) viability was also tested. RESULT: In the agar diffusion assay, drug suspension of 2 g/mL was able to inhibit all the bacterial species tested, but not the fungal species. MIC and MBC range of Prunus mume extract against the oral bacteria was 0.15625-0.0003 g/mL and P. gingivalis being the most susceptible species. Prune extract did not cause any detrimental effect on HOK. CONCLUSION: Prunus mume extract may be a potential candidate for developing an oral antimicrobial agent to control or prevent dental diseases associated with oral pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Short- and medium-chain fatty acids exhibit antimicrobial activity for oral microorganisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the antibacterial activity of short-, medium-, and long-chain fatty acids against various oral microorganisms. METHODS: The short-chain fatty acids [formic acid (C1), acetic acid (C2), propionic acid (C3), butyric acid (C4), isobutyric acid (C4), isovaleric acid (C5), hexanoic acid (C6)], medium-chain fatty acids [octanoic acid (C8), capric acid (C10), lauric acid (12)], and long-chain fatty acids [myristic acid (C14), palmitic acid (C16)], were investigated for antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus sanguis, Candida albicans, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. RESULTS: The data demonstrated that the fatty acids exhibited patterns of inhibition against oral bacteria with some specificity that appeared related more to the bacterial species that the general structural characteristics of the microorganism. As a group the fatty acids were much less effective against C. albicans than the oral bacteria, with effectiveness limited to hexanoic, octanoic, and lauric acids. Formic acid, capric, and lauric acids were broadly inhibitory for the bacteria. Interestingly, fatty acids that are produced at metabolic end-products by a number of these bacteria, were specifically inactive against the producing species, whilst substantially inhibiting the growth of other oral microorganisms. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the antimicrobial activity of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs), long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) could influence the microbial ecology in the oral cavity via at least 2 potential pathways. First, the agents delivered exogenously as therapeutic adjuncts could be packaged to enhance a microbial-regulatory environment in the subgingival sulcus. Second, it would be the intrinsic nature of these fatty acid inhibitors in contributing to the characteristics of the microbial biofilms, their evolution, and emergence of species within the biofilms. Further studies on these functions are required to better understand the nature of these potential microbial interactions in the biofilms.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of 15-deoxygoyazensolide isolated from the stems of Minasia alpestris (Asteraceae) against oral pathogens.
AB  - This work reports the isolation of the sesquiterpene lactone 15-deoxygoyazensolide from the stems of Minasia alpestris and the evaluation of its antimicrobial activity against the following oral pathogens: Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Lactobacillus casei. Despite the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of other sesquiterpene lactones of the furanoheliangolide-type, our results revealed that this compound exhibits low antibacterial activity against the evaluated oral pathogens; however, an interesting selectivity against E. faecalis (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC]=40 microg mL(-1)) and S. sobrinus (MIC=60 microg mL(-1)) was observed.
TI  - The effect of xylitol on the composition of the oral flora: a pilot study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to investigate the effect of short-term xylitol consumption on the microbial composition of plaque and saliva. METHODS: Twelve volunteers (22-38 yrs) harboring mutans streptococci (MS) participated in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. The experimental chewing gum contained 65% xylitol while the control gum contained 63% sorbitol and 2% maltitol w/w. The polyol dose was approximately 6 g/day. Stimulated saliva and plaque samples were collected before and after the two four-week test periods. The samples were cultured for MS, total streptococci, lactobacilli, and total facultatives. A part of the samples were subjected to DNA-DNA hybridizations of 14 microbial plaque species: Actinomyces naeslundii, A. viscosus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. fermentum, L. paracasei, L. rhamnose, L. plantarum, Streptococcus gordonii, S. oralis, S. parasanguis, S. salivarius, S. sanguinis, Veillonella parvula. RESULTS: The MS counts of the plaque samples collected from "caries-prone" tooth sites decreased significantly (P<.01) in the xylitol gum group but not in the sorbitol gum group. Also the plaque MS percentage decreased significantly in the xylitol gum group (P<.01). The salivary MS counts did not decrease either in the xylitol or in the sorbitol gum groups. Nor were changes detected in the salivary levels of total streptococci or lactobacilli. The DNA-DNA hybridization assay revealed no study-induced changes in the microbial composition of the dental plaque. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this pilot study, xylitol consumption reduced MS counts in plaque but appeared not to affect the microbial composition of plaque or saliva in general.
TI  - Influence of Salvadora persica (miswak) extract on physical and antimicrobial properties of glass ionomer cement.
AB  - AIM: To investigate physical and antimicrobial properties of Glass Ionomer Cement (GIC) combined with Salvadora Persica Extract (SPE). METHODS: SPE was added to GIC (Fuji IX) in concentrations of 1%, 2% and 4% w/w. The compressive strength and diametral tensile strength were measured at 1 h, 24 h and 7 days. The antimicrobial effect was tested in agar dilution assay in blood agar plates with Candida albicans, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus salivarius and Actinomyces naeslundii as test organisms. GIC containing 5% chlorhexidine served as positive control. RESULTS: Significant differences were found for the compressive strength and diametral tensile strength as a result of adding SPE to GIC (p<0.05). GIC with 2 or 4 % SPE was significantly weaker than the GIC control, while GIC with 1% SPE was not different from the control. The mean values for the 4% SPE-containing specimens and the GIC control group ranged from 108.7MPa to 141.1MPa for CS and from 8.2MPa to 12.5MPa for DTS. The 1% SPE-containing specimens were not different in physical properties compared to the control GIC specimens; the 2% SPE-containing specimens were statistically slightly less strong (p<0.05), but within an acceptable range. As compared with pure GIC the antimicrobial properties of the SPE-containing specimens were increased significantly (p<0.01). It has been found up to a 2-fold increased inhibition compared to the GIC with increasing concentrations of SPE. For most microorganisms tested the SPE group inhibited less than Chlorhexidine, but significantly better than pure GIC (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: SPE could be a promising natural material as an additive to GICs. Further studies should include in vivo tests and other antimicrobial and physical properties of this combination.
TI  - Antimicrobial and anti-adhesive potential of a biosurfactant Rufisan produced by  Candida lipolytica UCP 0988.
AB  - In the last years, researches developed with biosurfactants for application in the medical area have been revealing the promising biological activities of these biomolecules. In this work the antimicrobial and anti-adhesive properties of a biosurfactant Rufisan isolated from the yeast Candida lipolytica UCP 0988, growth in a medium supplemented with ground nut refinery residue was determined against several microorganisms. The biosurfactant was able to reduce the water surface tension from 70 to 25.3 mN/m and showed a critical micelle concentration (CMC) of 0.03%. The biosurfactant was isolated after 72 h of fermentation and was tested in concentrations varying from 0.75 to 12 mg/l. The highest antimicrobial activities were observed against Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mutans NS, Streptococcus mutans HG, Streptococcus sanguis 12, Streptococcus oralis J22 at a concentration superior to the biosurfactant critical micelle concentration. Moreover, the biosurfactant showed anti-adhesive activity against most of the microorganisms tested. As far as we know, this is the first compilation of data on antimicrobial and anti-adhesive activities of a biosurfactant obtained from a Candida strain against such a broad group of microorganisms. The results obtained in this work showed that the biosurfactant from C. lipolytica is a potential antimicrobial and/or anti-adhesive agent for several biomedical applications.
TI  - An antimicrobial effect from silver-coated toothbrush heads.
AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the antimicrobial effect of silver-coated toothbrush heads in vitro. METHODS: Comparisons were made between 62 silver-coated and 62 non-coated toothbrush heads which were contaminated by different standardized microbial suspensions. The following microorganisms were investigated: Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus, Lactobacillus casei and Candida albicans. For cultivation of the microorganisms as well as for the subsequent determination of the colony forming units (CFUs), Columbia blood agar plates or Sabouraud agar were used. The cycle of daily toothbrushing was imitated by rinsing the brushes with 200 ml sterile tap water to reduce the number of microorganisms and the brushes were then placed upright to allow drying overnight. Colony counts were done initially (time 0) and again at 20 hours. The rinsing fluid was also examined in order to determine the decrease of microorganisms due to this step. All experiments were done twice and the means were calculated and statistically evaluated. RESULTS: There was no significant reduction in CFUs by silver-coated toothbrushes (P > 0.05) for all of the microorganisms tested. On the contrary, the colony counts for S. sanguis (P = 0.02) and C. albicans (P = 0.01) were significantly higher on silver-coated toothbrushes compared to the controls. Silver-coating in the current form did not improve any antimicrobial effects against residual bacteria present on the toothbrush head.
TI  - Identification of different bacterial species in biofilms using confocal Raman microscopy.
AB  - Confocal Raman microspectroscopy is used to discriminate between different species of bacteria grown in biofilms. Tests are performed using two bacterial species, Streptococcus sanguinis and Streptococcus mutans, which are major components of oral plaque and of particular interest due to their association with healthy and cariogenic plaque, respectively. Dehydrated biofilms of these species are studied as a simplified model of dental plaque. A prediction model based on principal component analysis and logistic regression is calibrated using pure biofilms of each species and validated on pure biofilms grown months later, achieving 96% accuracy in prospective classification. When biofilms of the two species are partially mixed together, Raman-based identifications are achieved within approximately 2 mum of the boundaries between species with 97% accuracy. This combination of spatial resolution and predication accuracy should be suitable for forming images of species distributions within intact two-species biofilms.
TI  - Molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) of gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE gene loci in viridans group streptococci isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Ciprofloxacin is the most frequently used member of the fluoroquinolones during initial eradication therapy of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as during acute pulmonary exacerbations. However, its long-term effect on the susceptibility of the commensal flora within the cystic fibrosis (CF) airways has not yet been examined. The aim of this study was therefore to examine the consequence of oral ciprofloxacin usage on the resistance of the commensal viridans group streptococci (VGS), in terms of MICs and mutational analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs). METHODS: The MICs of ciprofloxacin, efflux activities and amino acid substitutions in the QRDRs for 190 isolates of VGS, originating from the sputa of adult CF patients who had been exposed constantly to ciprofloxacin, were examined. VGS organisms included Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus parasanguinis, Streptococcus infantis, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus cristatus, Streptococcus australis and Streptococcus mutans. Ciprofloxacin susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution and QRDRs within the gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE gene loci were explored using sequence analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-seven (14.2%) streptococcal isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin (MICs >/=8 mg/L) and 21 (11.1%) had reduced susceptibility (MICs 4 mg/L). As a comparator, clinically non-significant and non-invasive VGS organisms were examined in 12 consecutive non-CF patients in the community, where no resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed. Five novel QRDR PCR assays were developed to elucidate mutations within the CF VGS population, where there were six positions, which corresponded to previously reported quinolone resistance responsible mutations, and eight novel potential QRDR resistance mutations. Double mutations in gyrA and parC/parE led to MICs of 16 to >64 mg/L, while single mutations in parC or parE resulted in MICs of 8-32 mg/L and 8 mg/L, respectively. The mean homologies of each species to Streptococcus pneumoniae R6 were: gyrA, 70.3%-95%; gyrB, 69.6%-96.2%; parC, 76.1%-94.8%; and parE, 70.7%-94.7%. The close relatives of S. pneumoniae, S. mitis and S. oralis, showed high similarity for all four genes (more than 86%). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of P. aeruginosa with oral ciprofloxacin in patients with CF may concurrently reduce antibiotic susceptibility in the commensal VGS flora, where these organisms may potentially act as a reservoir of fluoroquinolone resistance gene determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens, particularly the Streptococcus milleri group.
TI  - Prevalence of five biofilm-related oral streptococci species from plaque.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence of five oral streptococci species of severe  early childhood caries (S-ECC) and caries-free (CF) groups. STUDY DESIGN: Supra gingival plaque samples were obtainedfrom 198 Thai children with ages ranging from one to six years old Eighty-seven subjects had no caries (dmft=0), and 111 had S-ECC. After DNA extraction, S. mutans, S. sobrinus, S. sanguinis, S. oralis, and S. gordonii were identified by standard PCR using species-specific primers. Statistical analysis determined the differences among prevalence rates of each species using Pearson chi-square test. The relationship among dmft score, age, sex and caries status within each group was analyzed by logistical regression (p < or = 0.05). RESULTS: Sex was not correlated with any of the species detected in both groups (mean age =3.09, mean +/- SD of dmft = 11.04 +/- 7.89). S. mutans was found at greatest prevalence in both groups followed by S. oralis. S. gordonii was detected at a high prevalence, but S. sobrinus and S. sanguinis were lower in S-ECC when compared with those from the CF group. CONCLUSION: S. mutans was associated significantly with S-ECC (p < or = 0.05). Caries prevalence was highest (56.5%) in subjects infected by S. mutans alone. S. sanguinis prevalence was higher in the CF group, but not statiscally different. Infection with MS did not show higher caries prevalence.
TI  - Population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (VGS) including Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).
AB  - A study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (VGS) in the sputum of adult patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Freshly expectorated sputa (n=58) from 45 adult CF patients were examined by selective conventional culture on Mitis-Salivarius agar and yielded 190 isolates of VGS. Sequence analyses of the rpnB and 16-23S rRNA ITS genes identified these isolates to belong to 12 species of VGS and included S. anginosus, S. australis, S. cristatus, S. gordonii, S. infantis, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. parasanguinis, S. pneumoniae, S. salivarius and S. sanguinis. The most frequently VGS organism isolated was S. salivarius (47/190; 24.7%), followed by S. mitis (36/190; 19%), S. sanguinis (25/190; 13.2%), S. oralis (20/190; 11.0%), S. pneumoniae (19/190; 10.0%), S. parasanguinis (16/190; 8.4%), S. infantis (11/190; 5.8%), S. gordonii (7/190; 3.7%), S. anginosus (4/190; 2.1%), S. cristatus (2/190; 1.1%), S. australis (1/190; 0.5%), S. mutans (1/190; 0.5%) and S. agalactiae (1/190; 0.5%). All, but four, patients harboured at least one VGS species, which ranged from one to five streptococcal species, with a mean of 2.85 species per patient. There was no clonality at the subspecies level employing ERIC RAPD PCR. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) testing against penicillin, erythromycin and ciprofloxacin. Overall, resistance to penicillin with all VGS was 73/190 (38.4%) and 167/190 (87.9%) for erythromycin. With regard to ciprofloxacin, 27/190 (14.2%) were fully resistant, whilst a further 21/190 (11.1%) showed intermediate resistance, which equated to approximately three quarters (74.7%) of isolates being fully sensitive to this agent. In addition, as a comparator control population, we examined antibiotic susceptibility, as above, in a non-CF population comprising 12 individuals (50 VGS isolates), who were not receiving chronic antibiotics. In comparison, 8% and 38% of VGS isolates from non-CF individuals were resistant by disk susceptibility testing to penicillin and erythromycin, respectively. None of the non-CF VGS organisms were resistant to ciprofloxacin, but 42% showed intermediate resistance.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the essential oil from Rosmarinus officinalis and its major components against oral pathogens.
AB  - The essential oil of Rosmarinus officinalis L. (rosemary) was obtained by hydro-distillation and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Sixty-two constituents were identified, representing 98.06% of the total oil content. Oxygenated monoterpenes were the predominant components. The rosemary oil was characterized as having prominent (> 5%) contents of camphor (18.9%), verbenone (11.3%), a-pinene (9.6%), beta-myrcene (8.6%), 1,8-cineole (8.0%), and beta-caryophyllene (5.1%). The antimicrobial activity of the oil as well as of its major constituents was tested against the following microorganisms: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sobrinus, and Enterococcus faecalis, which are potentially responsible for the formation of dental caries in humans. The microdilution method was used for determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) during evaluation of the antibacterial activity. The essential oil displayed low activity against the selected microorganisms. In the present study, the pure major compounds were more active than the essential oil. Among all the microorganisms tested, the pathogen S. mitis was the most susceptible and E. faecalis was the most resistant to the evaluated samples. This is the first report on antimicrobial activity of the major components of rosemary oil against oral pathogens.
TI  - Anticariogenic properties of ent-pimarane diterpenes obtained by microbial transformation.
AB  - In the present work, the anticariogenic activities of three pimarane-type diterpenes obtained by fungal biotransformation were investigated. Among these metabolites, ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol was the most active compound, displaying very promising MIC values (ranging from 1.5 to 4.0 mug mL(-1)) against the main microorganisms responsible for dental caries: Streptococcus salivarius, S. sobrinus, S. mutans, S. mitis, S. sanguinis, and Lactobacillus casei. Time kill assays performed with ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol against the primary causative agent S. mutans revealed that this compound only avoids growth of the inoculum in the first 12 h (bacteriostatic effect). However, its bactericidal effect is clearly noted thereafter (between 12 and 24 h). The curve profile obtained by combining ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol and chlorhexidine revealed a significant reduction in the time necessary for killing S. mutans compared with each of these two chemicals alone. However, no synergistic effect was observed using the same combination in the checkerboard assays against this microorganism. In conclusion, our results point out that ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol is an important metabolite in the search for new effective anticariogenic agents.
TI  - Antibacterial activity and cytotoxicity of two novel cross-linking antibacterial  monomers on oral pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The antibacterial activity and cytotoxicity of two novel cross-linking antibacterial monomers, 2-methacryloxylethyl dodecyl methyl ammonium bromide (MAE-DB) and 2-methacryloxylethyl hexadecyl methyl ammonium bromide (MAE-HB) were tested in this study. DESIGN: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of unpolymerized MAE-DB and MAE-HB against eight strains of oral bacteria were tested using a broth dilution test. Time-kill determinations were performed to examine the kinetics of unpolymerized MAE-DB and MAE-HB against Streptococcus mutans UA159 and Streptococcus sanguinis ATCC6715. Bacterial morphology was observed using a field emission scanning electron microscope (Fe-SEM). The cytotoxicity of unpolymerized two new monomers and Bis-GMA on the human gingival fibroblast cell line H2620 was assessed using a methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay. RESULTS: Unpolymerized MAE-DB and MAE-HB showed strong bactericidal activity against oral bacteria. The MBC value of MAE-DB ranged from 12.2 to 24.4mug/ml and the MBC value of MAE-HB ranged from 6.2 to 48.8mug/ml. Time-kill determinations indicated that unpolymerized MAE-DB and MAE-HB had rapid killing effects against S. mutans UA159 and S. sanguinis ATCC6715 at the concentration of 4x MBC. The Fe-SEM observation showed that MAE-DB and MAE-HB could disturb the integrity of bacteria and cause lysis of bacterial cells. The median lethal concentration values on human gingival fibroblast for both monomers were between 10 and 20mug/ml, and greater than that of Bis-GMA. CONCLUSIONS: Unpolymerized MAE-DB and MAE-HB monomers had strong bactericidal activity against eight strains of oral bacteria. Their cytotoxicities were less than that of Bis-GMA.
TI  - [Classical and new approaches in laboratory diagnosis of viridans streptococci].
AB  - Viridans group streptococci (VGS) are gram-positive microorganisms that can form  alpha-hemolytic colonies on sheep blood agar. They reside as normal flora in oral cavity, respiratory, gastrointestinal, urogenital tract and on skin. They can cause bacteremia, endocarditis, meningitis and septicemia following dental procedures. The diagnosis of VGS are difficult since the taxonomic classification and species na-mes may change due in time. Viridans group streptococci are classified into 5 groups (Sanguinis, Mitis, Mutans, Salivarius, Anginosus) according to biochemical reactions and 16S rRNA sequencing. Since Streptococcus pneumoniae is a member of the Mitis group, the other important species in this group deserves investigation. Genetic exchange between Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis and S.pneumoniae by transformation and lysis mechanisms occur continously as they share the same anatomical region. These mechanisms play role in exchanging capsular and antibiotic resistance genes between these species. The cultivation of VGS usually starts with the inoculation of various patient specimens into sheep blood agar and the detection of alpha-hemolytic colonies. Observation of gram-positive cocci microscopically, the detection of optochin-resistant and bile insoluble colonies with few exceptions are the further important steps in laboratory diagnosis. VGS are then identified at species level by using biochemical reactions, automated diagnostic systems and molecular methods. The last step in the laboratory diagnosis of VGS is antibiotic susceptibility testing which is of outmost importance as penicillin and erythromycin resistance are on rise. In this review article, classification of VGS, similarities between S.pneumoniae and Mitis group streptococci and the laboratory diagnosis of VGS have been discussed.
TI  - Setup of an in vitro test system for basic studies on biofilm behavior of mixed-species cultures with dental and periodontal pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Caries and periodontitis are important human diseases associated with formation of multi-species biofilms. The involved bacteria are intensively studied to understand the molecular basis of the interactions in such biofilms. This study established a basic in vitro single and mixed-species culture model for oral bacteria combining three complimentary methods. The setup allows a rapid screening for effects in the mutual species interaction. Furthermore, it is easy to handle, inexpensive, and reproducible. METHODS: Streptococcus mitis, S. salivarius and S. sanguinis, typical inhabitants of the healthy oral cavity, S. mutans as main carriogenic species, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra, S. intermedius and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans as periodontitis-associated bacteria, were investigated for their biofilm forming ability. Different liquid growth media were evaluated. Safranin-staining allowed monitoring of biofilm formation under the chosen conditions. Viable counts and microscopy permitted investigation of biofilm behavior in mixed-species and transwell setups. FINDINGS: S. mitis, F. nucleatum, P. gingivalis and P. micra failed to form biofilm structures. S. mutans, S. sanguinis, S. intermedius and S. salivarius established abundant biofilm masses in CDM/sucrose. A. actinomycetemcomitans formed patchy monolayers. For in depth analysis S. mitis, S. mutans and A. actinomycetemcomitans were chosen, because i) they are representatives of the physiological-, cariogenic and periodontitis-associated bacterial flora, respectively and ii) their difference in their biofilm forming ability. Microscopic analysis confirmed the results of safranin staining. Investigation of two species combinations of S. mitis with either S. mutans or A. actinomycetemcomitans revealed bacterial interactions influencing biofilm mass, biofilm structure and cell viability. CONCLUSIONS: This setup shows safranin staining, microscopic analysis and viable counts together are crucial for basic examination and evaluation of biofilms. Our experiment generated meaningful results, exemplified by the noted S. mitis influence, and allows a fast decision about the most important bacterial interactions which should be investigated in depth.
TI  - Investigation of supragingival plaque microbiota in different caries status of Chinese preschool children by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  - This study aimed to detect differences in the richness of total supragingival plaque microbiota as well as the species composition of oral streptococci involved in the different stages of dental caries. Forty-five plaque samples were collected from caries-moderate (CM, 4 </= dmfs </= 6), caries-susceptible (CS, dmfs >/= 10), and age-matched caries-free children separately. Total DNA was isolated directly from each sample, and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) analyses using universal and primers specific for oral streptococci were carried out. Using 16S rDNA PCR-DGGE, 34 different species of bacteria were identified in a culture-independent manner and classified into 11 genera according to phylogenetic analysis. Among them, Mitis group streptococci and Campylobacter, which were present in health status, no longer appeared in caries-susceptible samples. In addition, Capnocytophaga, Burkholderia, and Prevotella were found significantly less frequently in the CS group samples (P < 0.05), while there were no significant differences among the prevalence of Neisseria, Leptotrichia, Haemophilus, Mutans group streptococci, Corynebacterium, and Actinomyces in the three groups. Further DGGE analysis of rnpB gene amplicons obtained with oral streptococci species-specific primers showed that a total of 23 species of oral streptococci were identified. Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mitis, and Streptococcus oralis showed a significantly higher prevalence in healthy children (P < 0.05), while that of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus did not vary among the three groups. Overall, these results suggest that supragingival plaque microbiota as a whole undergoes a more complicated shift in the caries process.
TI  - Clonal analysis of the microbiota of severe early childhood caries.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Severe early childhood caries is a microbial infection that severely compromises the dentition of young children. The aim of this study was to characterize the microbiota of severe early childhood caries. METHODS: Dental plaque samples from 2- to 6-year-old children were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene cloning and sequencing, and by specific PCR amplification for Streptococcus mutans and Bifidobacteriaceae species. RESULTS: Children with severe caries (n = 39) had more dental plaque and gingival inflammation than caries-free children (n = 41). Analysis of phylotypes from operational taxonomic unit analysis of 16S rRNA clonal metalibraries from severe caries and caries-free children indicated that while libraries differed significantly (p < 0.0001), there was increased diversity than detected in this clonal analysis. Using the Human Oral Microbiome Database, 139 different taxa were identified. Within the limits of this study, caries-associated taxa included Granulicatella elegans (p < 0.01) and Veillonella sp. HOT-780 (p < 0.01). The species associated with caries-free children included Capnocytophaga gingivalis (p < 0.01), Abiotrophia defectiva (p < 0.01), Lachnospiraceae sp. HOT-100 (p < 0.05), Streptococcus sanguinis (p < 0.05) and Streptococcus cristatus (p < 0.05). By specific PCR, S. mutans (p < 0.005) and Bifidobacteriaceae spp. (p < 0.0001) were significantly associated with severe caries. CONCLUSION: Clonal analysis of 80 children identified a diverse microbiota that differed between severe caries and caries-free children, but the association of S. mutans with caries was from specific PCR analysis, not from clonal analysis, of samples.
TI  - Identification of hydrogen peroxide production-related genes in Streptococcus sanguinis and their functional relationship with pyruvate oxidase.
AB  - Hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), an important substance produced by many members of  the genus Streptococcus, plays important roles in virulence and antagonism within a microbial community such as oral biofilms. The spxB gene, which encodes pyruvate oxidase, is involved in H(2)O(2) production in many streptococcal species. However, knowledge about its regulation and relation with other genes putatively involved in the same pathway is limited. In this study, three genes--ackA, spxR and tpk--were identified as contributing to H(2)O(2) production in Streptococcus sanguinis by screening mutants for opaque colony appearance. Mutations in all three genes resulted in significant decreases in H(2)O(2) production, with 16-31% of that of the wild-type. H(2)O(2) production was restored in the complemented strains. Antagonism against Streptococcus mutans by these three S. sanguinis mutants was reduced, both on plates and in liquid cultures, indicating the critical roles of these three genes for conferring the competitive advantage of S. sanguinis. Analysis by qPCR indicated that the expression of spxB was decreased in the ackA and spxR mutants and significantly increased in the tpk mutant.
TI  - Resistance to acidic environments of caries-associated bacteria: Bifidobacterium  dentium and Bifidobacterium longum.
AB  - Oral Bifidobacteriaceae, Bifidobacterium dentium and Bifidobacterium longum, are  known to be isolated together with mutans streptococci and lactobacilli from caries lesions, suggesting that these Bifidobacteriaceae are caries associated and acid resistant. This study aimed to investigate effects of acidification on B. dentium and B. longum, and to compare them with those on Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis and Lactobacillus paracasei. Effects of acidification, growth ability in a complex medium at a pH of 4.0-8.0, cell viability in 2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid monohydrate (MES)-KOH buffer at pH 4.0, as well as stability of intracellular pH (pH(in)) at an extracellular pH of 3.5-8.0 estimated using a fluorescent dye, 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate N-succinimidyl ester in MES-KOH, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid-KOH or N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine-KOH buffer, were investigated. B. longum grew as well as Streptococcus strains over a wide pH range, whereas B. dentium grew best in the narrow pH range around neutral. The cell viability of B. dentium decreased significantly after 2 h of acidification at a pH of 4.0, but this was significantly less than that of the Streptococcus and Lactobacillus species, whereas B. longum maintained almost 100% viability. The pH(in) was close to the extracellular pH at pH of 5.5-7.5 in the Bifidobacterium and Streptococcus strains, while at a pH of <5.0, the pH(in) was higher than the extracellular pH in all the strains, but the pH(in) maintenance ability of Bifidobacterium strains was higher than that of the Streptococcus strains. The high survival rate and pH(in) maintenance ability of bifidobacteria comparable to that of S. mutans in the acidic environment may account for why bifidobacteria exist as stable species in acidic caries lesions together with mutans streptococci.
TI  - Characterization of anti-competitor activities produced by oral bacteria.
AB  - Most bacteria in nature exist in multispecies communities known as biofilms. In the natural habitat where resources (nutrient, space, etc.) are usually limited, individual species must compete or collaborate with other neighboring species in order to perpetuate in the multispecies community. The human oral cavity is colonized by >700 microbial species known as the indigenous microflora. This indigenous flora normally maintains an ecological balance through antagonistic as well as mutualistic interspecies interactions. However, environmental perturbation may disrupt this balance, leading to overgrowth of pathogenic species, which could in turn initiate diseases such as dental caries (tooth decay) and periodontitis (gum disease). Understanding the mechanisms of diversity maintenance may help development of novel approaches to manage these "polymicrobial diseases." In this chapter, we will focus on a well-characterized form of biochemical warfare: bacteriocins produced by Streptococcus mutans, a primary dental caries pathogen, and H(2)O(2) produced by Streptococcus sanguinis, an oral commensal. We will describe detailed methodologies on the competition assay, isolation, purification, and characterization of bacteriocins.
TI  - Nisin inhibits dental caries-associated microorganism in vitro.
AB  - Nisin, produced by Lactococcus lactis, is an antibiotic peptide to effectively antagonize a broad spectrum of Gram-positive bacteria, and is widely used as a safe food antimicrobial agent. In the present study, we investigated whether nisin could be used as an effective antibiotic peptide against the nine common cariogenic microorganisms, and its antimicrobial activity could be affected by the ingredients of saliva in oral cavity. In the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericide concentration (MBC) and spot-on-lawn assay, nisin displayed different MIC, MBC and antimicrobial activity against the nine tested strains. There was statistical difference between the inhibitory zone diameters of nisin against the different tested bacteria (p<0.05), but no statistical difference between the inhibitory zone diameters of nisin dissolved in PBS and saliva (p>0.05). Furthermore, morphology and membranes of Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus fermenti and Lactobacillus acidophilus with nisin treatment were observed and showed different degrees of variation by a Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM). Our findings suggested that nisin has considerable potential for prevention and treatment of dental caries.
TI  - In vitro oral biofilm formation on triclosan-coated sutures in the absence and presence of additional antiplaque treatment.
AB  - PURPOSE: This study evaluated the in vitro plaque inhibitory effect of triclosan-coated polyglactin 910 sutures in the absence and presence of an additional antiplaque agent commonly used after oral surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Triclosan-coated sutures were incubated for 4 hours in freshly collected human saliva and, when appropriate, subsequently treated with an antiplaque rinse containing chlorhexidine-cetyl pyridinium as active components. Sutures without a triclosan-coating served as a control. RESULTS: Triclosan-coated sutures harbored similar amounts of plaque as did uncoated sutures. Exposure to the antiplaque rinse caused significant decreases in viable organisms for uncoated and triclosan-coated sutures. However, after application of the antiplaque rinse, more micro-organisms were found on triclosan-coated than on uncoated sutures. CONCLUSION: Sutures coated with triclosan do not provide a sufficient antimicrobial effect to prevent in vitro colonization by oral bacteria, whereas use in combination with a chlorhexidine-cetyl pyridinium-containing antiplaque rinse appears to be counterproductive.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of various self-etching adhesive systems against oral streptococci.
AB  - The antibacterial properties of self-etching adhesive systems constitute an important issue in operative dentistry, since viable bacteria can still be present after cavity preparation. The current study evaluated the antibacterial activity of five one-step self-etching adhesives (SEAs) and four self-etching primers (SEPs) against oral streptococci. Clearfil S3 (S3), One-Up Bond F Plus (OU), Futurabond NR (FB), GBond (GB), Xeno IV (X4), Clearfil SE Bond (SE), Clearfil Protect Bond (PB), Adper SE Plus (AS) and AdheSE (AD) were tested for antibacterial activity against five streptococci species: S oralis, S sanguinis, S cricetus, S mutans and S sobrinus. Chlorhexidine (0.12%) and phosphoric acid (37%) gel were used as control. The agar diffusion test method was used. Plates containing BHI agar and 300 uL of bacterial cell suspension (0.5 MacFarland) were prepared. Holes 6 mm in diameter were made and partially filled with bacteriological agar. Then, 10 uL of each SEA or SEP was dropped and the plates were incubated under microaerophilic atmosphere at 37 degrees C for 48 hours and the diameter of each halo was registered. The results were analyzed by two-way ANOVA and Tukey test. PB exhibited the most effective antibacterial activity against oral streptococci. The performances of SE and FB were similar or better than chlorhexidine for all bacteria. S3, X4, AS, AD, OU and GB showed significantly lower inhibition values. Among the species tested, S oralis was the most sensitive to all self-etching adhesive systems; on the other hand, S cricetus, S mutans and S sobrinus were more resistant. Among the self-etching adhesive systems evaluated, Clearfil Protect Bond exhibited the most effective antibacterial activity against oral streptococci.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Rosmarinus officinalis against oral pathogens: relevance of carnosic acid and carnosol.
AB  - The in vitro inhibitory activity of crude EtOH/H2O extracts from the leaves and stems of Rosmarinus officinalis L. was evaluated against the following microorganisms responsible for initiating dental caries: Streptococcus mutans, S. salivarius, S. sobrinus, S. mitis, S. sanguinis, and Enterococcus faecalis. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined with the broth microdilution method. The bioassay-guided fractionation of the leaf extract, which displayed the higher antibacterial activity than the stem extract, led to the identification of carnosic acid (2) and carnosol (3) as the major compounds in the fraction displaying the highest activity, as identified by HPLC analysis. Rosmarinic acid (1), detected in another fraction, did not display any activity against the selected microorganisms. HPLC Analysis revealed the presence of low amounts of ursolic acid (4) and oleanolic acid (5) in the obtained fractions. The results suggest that the antimicrobial activity of the extract from the leaves of R. officinalis may be ascribed mainly to the action of 2 and 3.
TI  - Alkali production associated with malolactic fermentation by oral streptococci and protection against acid, oxidative, or starvation damage.
AB  - Alkali production by oral streptococci is considered important for dental plaque  ecology and caries moderation. Recently, malolactic fermentation (MLF) was identified as a major system for alkali production by oral streptococci, including Streptococcus mutans. Our major objectives in the work described in this paper were to further define the physiology and genetics of MLF of oral streptococci and its roles in protection against metabolic stress damage. L-Malic acid was rapidly fermented to L-lactic acid and CO(2) by induced cells of wild-type S. mutans, but not by deletion mutants for mleS (malolactic enzyme) or mleP (malate permease). Mutants for mleR (the contiguous regulator gene) had intermediate capacities for MLF. Loss of capacity to catalyze MLF resulted in loss of capacity for protection against lethal acidification. MLF was also found to be protective against oxidative and starvation damage. The capacity of S. mutans to produce alkali from malate was greater than its capacity to produce acid from glycolysis at low pH values of 4 or 5. MLF acted additively with the arginine deiminase system for alkali production by Streptococcus sanguinis, but not with urease of Streptococcus salivarius. Malolactic fermentation is clearly a major process for alkali generation by oral streptococci and for protection against environmental stresses.
TI  - [Study on the counting of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Haemophilus actinomycetemcomitans by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium colorimetric method].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the feasibility of methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) colorimetric method and the applied condition for the normal bacteria in the mouth, as Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans), Streptococcus sanguis (S. sanguis), Haemophilus actinomycetemcomitans (H. actinomycetemcomitans). METHODS: Colony forming units (CFU) which was the standard antitheses was used to count bacteria. This study would gain some parameters by changing wavelength, reactive time, dosage and so on. MTT colorimetric method was applied in the counting of S. mutans, S. sanguis and H. actinomycetemcomitans. RESULTS: When counting S. mutans, the best wavelength was 510 nm, the best range was 1.5 x 10(5) - 1.0 x 10(7) CFU x mL(-1). When counting S. sanguis, the best wavelength was 545 nm, the best range was 1.5 x 10(5) - 2.0 x 10(7) CFU x mL(-1). When counting H. actinomycetemcomitans, the best wavelength was 557 nm, the best range was 1.0 x 10(6) - 5.0 x 10(7) CFU x mL(-1). MTT colorimetric method can be used for different aged S. mutans, S. sanguis and H. actinomycetemcomitans. CONCLUSION: Oral bacteria could be counted by MTT colorimetric method, which is fast and convenient.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of terpenoids from Copaifera langsdorffii Desf. against cariogenic bacteria.
AB  - In the present work, the anticariogenic activities of nine labdane type-diterpenes and four sesquiterpenes were investigated. Among these metabolites, (-)-copalic acid (CA) was the most active compound displaying MIC values very promising (ranging from 2.0 to 6.0 microg/mL) against the main microorganisms responsible for dental caries: Streptococcus salivarius, S. sobrinus, S. mutans, S. mitis, S. sanguinis and Lactobacillus casei. Time kill assays performed with CA against the primary causative agent (S. mutans) revealed that, in the first 12 h, this compound only inhibits the growth of the inoculum (bacteriostatic effect). However, its bactericidal effect is clearly noted thereafter (between 12 and 24 h). Also, CA did not show a synergistic effect when combined with the anticariogenic gold standard (chlorhexidine, CHD) in the checkerboard assays against S. mutans. In conclusion, the results points out CA as an important metabolite in the search for new effective anticariogenic agents.
TI  - Streptococcus mutans inhibits Candida albicans hyphal formation by the fatty acid signaling molecule trans-2-decenoic acid (SDSF).
AB  - In the human mouth, fungi and several hundred species of bacteria coexist. Here we report a case of interkingdom signaling in the oral cavity: A compound excreted by the caries bacterium Streptococcus mutans inhibits the morphological transition from yeast to hyphae, an important virulence trait, in the opportunistic fungus Candida albicans. The compound excreted by S. mutans was originally studied because it inhibited signaling by the universal bacterial signal autoinducer-2 (AI-2), determined by the luminescence of a Vibrio harveyi sensor strain. The inhibitor was purified from cell-free culture supernatants of S. mutans guided by its activity. Its chemical structure was elucidated by using NMR spectroscopy and GC-MS and proved to be trans-2-decenoic acid. We show that trans-2-decenoic acid does not inhibit AI-2-specific signaling, but rather the luciferase reaction used for its detection. A potential biological role of trans-2-decenoic acid was then discovered. It is able to suppress the transition from yeast to hyphal morphology in the opportunistic human pathogen Candida albicans at concentrations that do not affect growth. The expression of HWP1, a hyphal-specific signature gene of C. albicans, is abolished by trans-2-decenoic acid. trans-2-Decenoic acid is structurally similar to the diffusible signal factor (DSF) family of interkingdom-signaling molecules and is the first member of this family from a Gram-positive organism (Streptococcus DSF, SDSF). SDSF activity was also found in S. mitis, S. oralis, and S. sanguinis, but not in other oral bacteria. SDSF could be relevant in shaping multispecies Candida bacteria biofilms in the human body.
TI  - Mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  - The oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. When this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. Generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. The mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. Several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the Streptococcus (Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis) and Staphylococcus (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Porphyromonas gingivalis. In addition, some members of both the Streptococcus and the Staphylococcus genera, as well as Porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. The current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. The pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of n-6, n-7 and n-9 fatty acids and their esters for oral  microorganisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study is to assess the antibacterial activity of omega-6, -7, -9  (n-6, n-7, n-9) fatty acids against various oral microorganisms. METHODS: The n-6, n-7, n-9 fatty acids, such as gamma-linoleic acid (GLA), linoleic acid (LA), arachidonic acid (ARA), palmitoleic acid (PA), and oleic acid (OA), their fatty acid ethyl esters, GLA-EE, LA-EE, ARA-EE, PA-EE, OA-EE, and their fatty acid methyl esters, GLA-ME, LA-ME, ARA-ME, PA-ME, OA-ME, were investigated for antimicrobial activity against oral pathogens Streptococcus mutans, Candida albicans, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Various concentrations of the fatty acids, their methyl and ethyl esters were tested against various oral pathogens in 96-well plates and blood-agar plate. The plates were incubated anaerobically or aerobically at 37 degrees C for 48h, and the colony forming units (CFU) were determined. RESULTS: The data demonstrated that select n-6, n-7, n-9 fatty acids and their esters exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against these oral microorganisms, demonstrating some specificity for individual microbial species. CONCLUSION: The potential use or the combinations of the n-6, n-7, n-9 fatty acids and/or their esters, provided in a local delivery vehicle to infected sites in the oral cavity, could be considered as an additional therapeutic approach to improving oral health.
TI  - Antimicrobial efficacy of 3 oral antiseptics containing octenidine, polyhexamethylene biguanide, or Citroxx: can chlorhexidine be replaced?
AB  - BACKGROUND: Use of oral antiseptics decreases the bacterial load in the oral cavity. OBJECTIVE: To compare the antimicrobial activity of 3 novel oral antiseptics with that of chlorhexidine, which is considered the "gold standard" of oral hygiene. DESIGN: Comparative in vitro study. METHODS: Four common oral microorganisms (Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mutans, Candida albicans, and Fusobacterium nucleatum) were tested under standard conditions and at different concentrations, by use of a broth dilution assay and an agar diffusion assay and by calculating the log10 reduction factor (RF). The antimicrobial activity of each antiseptic was assessed by counting the difference in bacterial densities (ie, the log10 number of colony-forming units of bacteria) before and after the disinfection process. RESULTS: The oral antiseptics containing octenidine (with an RF in the range of 7.1-8.24 CFU/mL) and polyhexamethylene biguanide (with an RF in the range of 7.1-8.24 CFU/mL) demonstrated antimicrobial activity comparable to that of chlorhexidine (with an RF in the range of 1.03-8.24 CFU/mL), whereas the mouth rinse containing Citroxx (Citroxx Biosciences; with an RF in the range of 0.22-1.36 CFU/mL) showed significantly weaker antimicrobial efficacy. Overall, octenidine and polyhexamethylene biguanide were more active at lower concentrations.conclusion. Oral antiseptics containing the antimicrobial agent octenidine or polyhexamethylene biguanide may be considered as potent alternatives to chlorhexidine-based preparations.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Chinese medicine herbs against common bacteria in oral  biofilm. A pilot study.
AB  - Twenty traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against four common oral bacteria. TCMs were tested for sensitivity against Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Aliquots of suspension of each bacterial species were inoculated onto a horse blood agar plate with TCMs soaked separately on 6mm paper disks. The plates were incubated for 48h anaerobically and the mean diameters of growth inhibition of three different areas obtained. 0.2% (w/v) chlorhexidine was used as a positive control. Broth microdilution assay was used to determine minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration. Fructus armeniaca mume was effective against all four bacteria. Thirteen TCMs demonstrated antimicrobial activity against Porphyromonas gingivalis, including Cortex magnoliae officinalis, Cortex phellodendri, Flos caryophylli, Flos lonicerae japonicae, Fructus armeniaca mume, Fructus forsythiae suspensae, Herba cum radice violae yedoensitis, Herba menthae haplocalycis, Pericarpium granati, Radix et rhizoma rhei, Radix gentianae, Ramulus cinnamomi cassia and Rhizoma cimicifugae. Cortex phellodendri showed antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans, while Radix et rhizoma rhei was effective against Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus sanguis. Fructus armeniaca mume had inhibitory effects against Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans and Porphyromonas gingivalis in vitro.
TI  - Biofilm formation and virulence expression by Streptococcus mutans are altered when grown in dual-species model.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Microbial cell-cell interactions in the oral flora are believed to play an integral role in the development of dental plaque and ultimately, its pathogenicity. The effects of other species of oral bacteria on biofilm formation and virulence gene expression by Streptococcus mutans, the primary etiologic agent of dental caries, were evaluated using a dual-species biofilm model and RealTime-PCR analysis. RESULTS: As compared to mono-species biofilms, biofilm formation by S. mutans was significantly decreased when grown with Streptococcus sanguinis, but was modestly increased when co-cultivated with Lactobacillus casei. Co-cultivation with S. mutans significantly enhanced biofilm formation by Streptococcus oralis and L. casei, as compared to the respective mono-species biofilms. RealTime-PCR analysis showed that expression of spaP (for multi-functional adhesin SpaP, a surface-associated protein that S. mutans uses to bind to the tooth surface in the absence of sucrose), gtfB (for glucosyltransferase B that synthesizes alpha1,6-linked glucan polymers from sucrose and starch carbohydrates) and gbpB (for surface-associated protein GbpB, which binds to the glucan polymers) was decreased significantly when S. mutans were co-cultivated with L. casei. Similar results were also found with expression of spaP and gbpB, but not gtfB, when S. mutans was grown in biofilms with S. oralis. Compared to mono-species biofilms, the expression of luxS in S. mutans co-cultivated with S. oralis or L. casei was also significantly decreased. No significant differences were observed in expression of the selected genes when S. mutans was co-cultivated with S. sanguinis. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the presence of specific oral bacteria differentially affects biofilm formation and virulence gene expression by S. mutans.
TI  - Role of Streptococcus mutans eukaryotic-type serine/threonine protein kinase in interspecies interactions with Streptococcus sanguinis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Interspecies interactions of oral streptococci involve the production  and excretion of antimicrobial compounds to compete successfully during colonization. Bacteriocin production by Streptococcus mutans and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production by Streptococcus sanguinis have been demonstrated as crucial for the clinical relevant antagonism between both species. A potential target of H2O2 is the cell-envelop of S. mutans. In the present study, the role of cell-envelop associated eukaryotic serine/threonine protein kinase (STPK) in S. mutans during interspecies competition has been investigated. DESIGN: Allelic replacement via homologous recombination of the STPK encoding gene with a kanamycin resistant determinant has been constructed. The mutant has been screened for the susceptibility towards cell-envelope stress. A previously developed spotting assay was used to simulate interspecies competition. RESULTS: The STPK(-) mutant showed an increased susceptibility towards envelop stress caused by H2O2 and was significantly more inhibited during interspecies competition assays. CONCLUSIONS: S. mutans is able to sense antimicrobial compounds excreted by competing species and can potentially adjust the cell-envelop towards an increased resistance.
TI  - [Establishment and evaluation of the in vitro dynamic biofilm model].
AB  - PURPOSE: To establish a dynamic model which could simulate the ecologic environment of oral cavity and study the cariogenicity of oral biofilm, continuously observe the formation of oral biofilm. METHODS: The fermental vessel and chemostat were designed according to the purpose of the study. Four strains of oral bacteria, namely Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Actinomyces naeslundii, were inoculated in the fermenter. The hydroxyapatite (HA) discs and glass slides were put in the chemostat. The temperature, oxide pressure, pH, dilution rate, circulation rate and substrate of the chemostat were carefully modulated. Distilled water and 25mM sucrose solution were used to test the stability of the system. At the beginning of the model establishment, the anabiosis bacteria were inoculated in fermenter full of fresh artificial saliva with a dilution rate of 10%. After the growth of bacteria in the fermenter was stable, the four-organism bacterial consortium was inoculated in the chemotat for 24 hours together with fresh artificial saliva (v/v=1:9). The organisms in planktonic phase were examined everyday. When the populations of consortium got stable(about 72 hours), the test solution was pulsed in the chemostat every 12 hours for 5 days. The HA discs and glass slides were observed every 24 hours for five times. The data was analyzed using SPSS 10.0 software package. Dunnet t test was used to compare the difference between the two groups at the level of alpha=0.05. RESULTS: The dynamic model was successfully established on oral biofilm study. With the pulse of sucrose solution, the environment in the chemostat simulated the cariogenic environment in nature, and all data namely the bacteria population, the biofilm microstructure changed with solution pulse. CONCLSUIONS: The model established is proved to be stable and the parameters in the model could be successfully controlled. The model fulfills the dynamic observation of formation of biofilm and caries lesion in vitro.
TI  - [Dissertations 25 years after date 21. Enhancing resistance to bacteria with chlorhexidine varnish and probiotics].
AB  - The aim of the research described in 'Chemotherapy against Streptococcus mutans'  was to increase colonization resistance against mutans streptococci by inoculating Actinomyces naeslundii on the dentition. Actinomyces naeslundii established better after chlorhexidine application than after dental cleansing only but did not exceed the 1% level of the total actinomyces population. This was insufficient to increase the colonization resistance against mutans streptococci. A 33% chlorhexidine varnish was developed. After a single short-term application of the varnish all plaque bacteria were erased. After several hours Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus gordonii re-established on the surface. Actinomyces naeslundii recovered later, but often with higher numbers. Mutans streptococci remained suppressed for months. This led to less acid production in dental plaque and caries reduction. The combination of mechanical cleansing and varnish application resulted in additional pocket reduction. Recently, attention is also established for research on the application ofprobiotics in periodotology.
TI  - Two new phenylpropanoid derivatives and other constituents from Illicium simonsii active against oral microbial organisms.
AB  - Bioassay-guided fractionation of the ethanol extract of the leaves and stems of Illicium simonsii led to the isolation of two new compounds, simonin A (1) and 1-hydroxyl-2- O- beta- D-6'-acetyl-glucopyranosyl-4-allylbenzene (2), along with eight known compounds. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic analysis. The isolates were tested for anti-oral microbial activity using a microdilution method. Compounds 1 and 3- 6 showed significant activities against oral microbial organisms (Actinomyces viscosus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, and Actinomyces naeslundii), with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 1.95 to 31.25 microg/mL in vitro.
TI  - Effect of a single-use toothbrush on plaque microflora.
AB  - AIM: To study and compare the microbial flora of dental plaque after the use of a self-contaminated toothbrush and that of a single-use toothbrush. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study group included 40 young volunteers from Yenepoya Dental College, who were free from any systemic or oral disease. In these subjects, plaque samples were collected after 1 month use of a self-contaminated toothbrush. Each subject was given a set of 30 new toothbrushes and a toothpaste tube and instructed to use one toothbrush everyday and discard it after use. The plaque samples were collected on a weekly interval and cultured on Mitis Salivarius agar. The colonies were identified and speciated and their count was recorded. RESULTS: Streptococcus mitis, S. mutans, S. sanguis, S. milleri and Candida were recovered from the samples. A highly significant decrease in their numbers was found after the use of a single-use toothbrush (P value 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: As a contaminated toothbrush can reintroduce microorganisms into the oral cavity, it may be a sound practice to change the toothbrush as frequently as possible.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity of compounds from the leaf and stem of Vitis amurensis against two oral pathogens.
AB  - Nine compounds isolated from the leaf and stem of Vitis amurensis Rupr. (Vitaceae) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against two oral pathogens, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis, which are associated with caries and periodontal disease, respectively. The results of several antimicrobial tests, including MIC, MBC, and TBAI, showed that three compounds inhibited the growth of the test bacteria at concentrations ranging from 12.5 to 50 microg/mL. Among these compounds, compound 5, trans-epsilon-viniferin, displayed the strongest activity against S. mutans and S. sanguis with MIC values of 25 and 12.5 microg/mL, respectively. This is the first report on the antimicrobial activity of stilbenes and oligostilbenes isolated from the leaf and stem of V. amurensis. Thus, this result suggests that natural antimicrobial compounds derived from V. amurensis may benefit oral health as plaque-control agents for the prevention of dental caries and periodontal disease.
TI  - Screening of Quercus infectoria gall extracts as anti-bacterial agents against dental pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A number of bacteria have now become antibiotic-resistant. This increases the importance of ayurvedic drugs. We report, here, the activity of different extracts (petroleum ether, chloroform, methanol and water) of Quercus infectoria galls against dental pathogens -- Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus acidophilus (designated) and Streptococcus sanguis (isolated). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cup-plate method was used in anti-bacterial activity of the extracts at concentration of 200 mg/ml against dental pathogens. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of most effective extracts against the most susceptible bacteria were determined using a two-fold serial micro dilution method. RESULTS: Methanolic extract showed maximum anti-bacterial activity against all the bacteria. The most susceptible bacteria were S. sanguis followed by S. aureus, S. mutans, S. salivarius and L. acidophilus. The MIC values showed that methanolic extract was more effective than water extract. CONCLUSION: The plant has the potential to generate herbal metabolites. The crude extracts demonstrating anti-dental caries activity could result in the discovery of new chemical classes of antibiotics. These chemical classes of antibiotics could serve as selective agents for the maintenance of human health and provide bio-chemical tools for the study of infectious diseases.
TI  - Partial recN gene sequencing: a new tool for identification and phylogeny within  the genus Streptococcus.
AB  - Partial sequences of the recN gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. The partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. The mean DNA sequence similarity of recN gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be lower than those of the 16S rRNA gene (94.1 %), rpoB (84.6 %), sodA (74.8 %), groEL (78.1 %) and gyrB (73.2 %). Phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: Streptococcus salivarius, S. equinus, S. hyovaginalis/S. pluranimalium/S. thoraltensis, S. pyogenes, S. mutans and S. suis. The 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: Streptococcus sanguinis/S. cristatus/S. sinensis, S. anginosus/S. intermedius/S. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and S. mitis/S. infantis/S. peroris/S. oralis/S. oligofermentans/S. pneumoniae/S. pseudopneumoniae. The partial recN gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. This observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groEL, gyrB, rpoB and sodA). A high percentage of similarity was found between S. intermedius and S. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recN gene. To study the genetic diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recN, groEL, sodA, gyrB and rpoB sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. The results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.
TI  - Inhibiting effects of Enterococcus faecium non-biofilm strain on Streptococcus mutans biofilm formation.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Enterococcus faecium is a normal bowel commensal and lactic acid bacterium that is rarely found in the oral cavity. This study investigated whether a non-pathogenic and non-biofilm strain of E. faecium functioned as a probiotic strain toward biofilm formation by Streptococcus mutans, which is an etiological agent for dental caries. METHODS: The effects of E. faecium on streptococcal biofilm was evaluated by absorbance of safranin-stained biofilm at 492 nm in a 96-well microtiter plate. RESULTS: The E. faecium strain demonstrated cell-number-dependent inhibition of biofilm in dual cultures with 4 laboratory and 16 clinical S. mutans strains, as well as laboratory strains of Streptococcus sobrinus and Streptococcus sanguinis, in 96-well microtiter plates. The inhibiting effects of E. faecium were not dependent on the production of bacteriocin from streptococci and E. faecium, low pH after mix culture, or biofilm formation levels of S. mutans. A culture supernatant sample of more than 10 kDa from E. faecium showed direct inhibiting effects toward S. mutans biofilm formation. Treatment of heat, butanol, and phenol to a supernatant sample restored biofilm formation in culture of S. mutans with the sample. Moreover, the tendencies of inhibition levels by the supernatant sample were associated with those by bacterial cells of E. faecium to S. mutans strains. CONCLUSIONS: The E. faecium non-biofilm strain produced an inhibiting protein to streptococci biofilm formation, showed various susceptibilities to inhibit streptococcal biofilm, and acted as a probiotic bacterial inhibitor of streptococcal biofilm formation.
TI  - An in vitro antimicrobial activity of ten Iranian-made toothpastes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial agents have been used as a chemotherapeutic agent to improve oral health. This in vitro study was carried out to determine the antimicrobial activity of ten Iranian-made toothpastes against commonly found bacteria in the oral cavity. METHODS: The microorganisms used in this study were Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus and Candida albicans. Sterile discs impregnated with 10 Iranian-made toothpastes; Paveh, Saviz, Latifeh II, Bath, Darugar II, Darugar I, Close up, Tage, Pooneh III and Nasim, which were separately used on agar plates. Crest Cavity Protection toothpaste and Sterile pyrogenfree distilled water were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The samples were tested in triplicate, at full strength, 1:1 and 1:3 dilutions. Inhibition zones were measured in millimeter after 48 hr. The data were analyzed by the ANOVA and t-test. RESULTS: All tested toothpastes demonstrated an antimicrobial activity. The antimicrobial activity of Bath on S. mutans, Paveh on S. sanguis, Paveh, Saviz, Latifeh III and Darugar II on C. albicans were similar to the activity of Crest Cavity Protection. The antimicrobial activity of Pooneh III and Nasim on S. mutans, Bath on S. sanguis and A. viscosus, and Bath and Pooneh III on C. albicans were significantly higher and the others were significantly lower than the positive control. While, the activity of Crest Cavity Protection was the same as Pooneh III, it showed a weaker activity compared with Bath. CONCLUSION: Apart from Bath and Pooneh III, the other Iranian-made toothpastes tested in this study showed a lower antimicrobial activity compared to Crest Cavity Protection.
TI  - Xylitol and erythritol decrease adherence of polysaccharide-producing oral streptococci.
AB  - Xylitol consumption decreases counts of mutans streptococci. However, the mechanism behind this decrease is not well understood. We studied not only type strains and clinical isolates of mutans streptococci, but also other polysaccharide-forming oral streptococci. Growth inhibition and adherence of cells to a smooth glass surface-reflecting synthesis of water-insoluble polysaccharides were studied in the presence of 2% (0.13 mol/l) and 4% (0.26 mol/l) xylitol. The effect of xylitol was compared to a novel polyol sweetener, erythritol. Except for Streptococcus mutans 10449 and S. sobrinus OMZ 176, the glass surface adhesion of most polysaccharide-forming streptococci was reduced by the presence of both 4% xylitol and erythritol. For the S. mutans and S. sobrinus type strains, the growth inhibition with 4% xylitol and erythritol was 36-77% and for the clinical S. mutans isolates 13-73%. Of the other oral streptococci, only S. sanguinis was inhibited with 4% xylitol (45-55%). For both polyols, the magnitude of the growth inhibition observed was not associated with the magnitude of the decrease in adherence (xylitol: r = -0.18; erythritol: r = 0.49). In conclusion, both xylitol and erythritol can decrease polysaccharide-mediated cell adherence contributing to plaque accumulation through a mechanism not dependent on growth inhibition.
TI  - Poisson analysis of streptococcal bond-strengthening on saliva-coated enamel.
AB  - The forces responsible for bond-strengthening in initial oral bacterial adhesion  are unknown. Since Lifshitz-Van der Waals and electrostatic forces work instantaneously upon approach, it is hypothesized that bond-strengthening is governed by hydrogen bonding. Poisson analysis of adhesion forces observed during the retraction of bacterial probes from surfaces in atomic force microscopy can be used to analyze the nature of the adhesion forces. Streptococcal adhesion forces increased from about -0.7 to -10.3 nN when the contact time between cell surfaces and salivary films on enamel was increased from 0 to 120 sec. Initial and final adhesion forces were stronger for initial colonizers of tooth surfaces (S. mitis, S. sanguinis) than for later, more cariogenic, strains (S. sobrinus, S. mutans). Retraction curves after increased contact times showed minor peaks, representative of hydrogen bonds, and Poisson analyses indicated repulsive non-specific forces of around +0.3 nN and slightly more attractive hydrogen-bonding forces (-1.0 nN) for initial than for late colonizers (-0.8 nN).
TI  - Oral Streptococcus species in pre-term and full-term children - a longitudinal study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite high clinical significance, the microbiology of the dental biofilm in young children remains poorly understood. AIM: The aim of this longitudinal study was to investigate five Streptoccocus species commonly found in the oral biofilm of children, namely Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Streptococcus salivarius to determine their relative numbers in caries-free pre-term children, and age-matched full-term controls. DESIGN: Plaque and saliva samples were obtained from 15 pre-term children and 15 age-matched controls at ages 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. A quantitative real-time PCR technique was used to determine the numbers of five species of Streptococcus using probes and primers specific for each bacterial species. RESULTS: All species of Streptococcus generally increased from ages 3 to 24 months. The relative ratios of the bacteria remained fairly constant at all ages studied (P > 0.1). There were no significant differences in numbers of all Streptococcus species between pre-term children and full-term controls at all the ages investigated between. CONCLUSION: The results show that the relative numbers of S. mutans, S. sobrinus, S. mitis, S. sanguinis, and S. salivarius remain relatively constant from 3 to 24 months of age in caries-free pre- and full-term children.
TI  - Influence of a model human defensive peroxidase system on oral streptococcal antagonism.
AB  - Streptococcus is a dominant genus in the human oral cavity, making up about 20 %  of the more than 800 species of bacteria that have been identified, and about 80 % of the early biofilm colonizers. Oral streptococci include both health-compatible (e.g. Streptococcus gordonii and Streptococcus sanguinis) and pathogenic strains (e.g. the cariogenic Streptococcus mutans). Because the streptococci have similar metabolic requirements, they have developed defence strategies that lead to antagonism (also known as bacterial interference). S. mutans expresses bacteriocins that are cytotoxic toward S. gordonii and S. sanguinis, whereas S. gordonii and S. sanguinis differentially produce H(2)O(2) (under aerobic growth conditions), which is relatively toxic toward S. mutans. Superimposed on the inter-bacterial combat are the effects of the host defensive mechanisms. We report here on the multifarious effects of bovine lactoperoxidase (bLPO) on the antagonism between S. gordonii and S. sanguinis versus S. mutans. Some of the effects are apparently counterproductive with respect to maintaining a health-compatible population of streptococci. For example, the bLPO system (comprised of bLPO+SCN(-)+H(2)O(2)) destroys H(2)O(2), thereby abolishing the ability of S. gordonii and S. sanguinis to inhibit the growth of S. mutans. Furthermore, bLPO protein (with or without its substrate) inhibits bacterial growth in a biofilm assay, but sucrose negates the inhibitory effects of the bLPO protein, thereby facilitating adherence of S. mutans in lieu of S. gordonii and S. sanguinis. Our findings may be relevant to environmental pressures that select early supragingival colonizers.
TI  - Effect of lactoperoxidase on the antimicrobial effectiveness of the thiocyanate hydrogen peroxide combination in a quantitative suspension test.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The positive antimicrobial effects of increasing concentrations of thiocyanate (SCN-) and H2O2 on the human peroxidase defence system are well known. However, little is known about the quantitative efficacy of the human peroxidase thiocyanate H2O2 system regarding Streptococcus mutans and sanguinis, as well as Candida albicans. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the enzyme lactoperoxidase on the bactericidal and fungicidal effectiveness of a thiocyanate-H2O2 combination above the physiological saliva level. To evaluate the optimal effectiveness curve, the exposure times were restricted to 1, 3, 5, and 15 min. RESULTS: The bactericidal and fungicidal effects of lactoperoxidase on Streptococcus mutans and sanguinis and Candida albicans were evaluated by using two test mixtures of a 2.0% (w/v; 0.34 M) thiocyanate and 0.4% (w/v; 0.12 M) hydrogen peroxide solution, one without and one with lactoperoxidase. Following the quantitative suspension tests (EN 1040 and EN 1275), the growth of surviving bacteria and fungi in a nutrient broth was measured. The reduction factor in the suspension test without lactoperoxidase enzyme was < 1 for all three tested organisms. Thus, the mixtures of 2.0% (w/v; 0.34 M) thiocyanate and 0.4% (w/v; 0.12 M) hydrogen peroxide had no in vitro antimicrobial effect on Streptococcus mutans and sanguinis or Candida albicans. However, the suspension test with lactoperoxidase showed a high bactericidal and fungicidal effectiveness in vitro. CONCLUSION: The tested thiocyanate and H2O2 mixtures showed no relevant antimicrobial effect. However, by adding lactoperoxidase enzyme, the mixtures became not only an effective bactericidal (Streptococcus mutans and sanguinis) but also a fungicidal (Candida albicans) agent.
TI  - Transient acid-impairment of growth ability of oral Streptococcus, Actinomyces, and Lactobacillus: a possible ecological determinant in dental plaque.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dental plaque pH decreases to about 4 through bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates and this low pH is maintained for from several minutes to about an hour. Repeated acidification causes demineralization of the tooth surface, resulting in caries formation. The acidification also influences plaque bacteria. Severe acidification kills bacteria efficiently, while physiological acidification, the condition occurring in plaque, kills bacteria partially and may impair growth ability. We, therefore, investigated the effects of physiological acidification on representative caries-related bacteria. METHODS: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus oralis, Lactobacillus paracasei, and Actinomyces naeslundii were used. Effects of physiological acidification at pH 4.0 on cell viability and growth ability, as well as the growth rate of these bacteria at pH 4.0-7.0, were investigated. RESULTS: Mutans streptococci and Lactobacillus grew at pH 4.0 but the growth of S. sanguinis and S. oralis ceased below pH 4.2 and pH 4.2-4.4, respectively. Acidification at pH 4.0 for 1 h killed 43-89%, 45% and 35-76% of S. sanguinis, S. oralis, and Actinomyces, respectively. Furthermore, assessment of bacterial growth curves revealed that the growth ability of the surviving cells of S. sanguinis, S. oralis and Actinomyces was impaired, but it was recovered within 2-5 h after the environmental pH had returned to 7.0. The acidification neither killed nor impaired the growth of mutans streptococci and Lactobacillus. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that physiological and transient acidification is not sufficient to kill bacteria, but it causes a temporary acid-impairment of their growth ability, which may function as an ecological determinant for microbial composition in dental plaque.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of yoghurt starter lactobacilli and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG adhesion to saliva-coated surfaces.
AB  - AIM: The aim of the study was to evaluate the adhesion of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG to saliva-coated surfaces in vitro. METHODS: Fifteen radiolabeled dairy L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strains and L. rhamnosus GG were tested for their ability to adhere to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads and polystyrene microtiter plates and the radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counter. The effects of lysozyme on the adhesion of lactobacilli and of pretreatment with lactobacilli on the adhesion of Streptococcus sanguinis were also assessed. RESULTS: All strains tested adhered to saliva-coated surfaces but with significantly different binding frequencies. The adhesion of the L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strains remained lower in comparison to L. rhamnosus strain GG. One L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strain showed binding frequency comparable to S. sanguinis. Lysozyme pretreatment of the samples significantly increased lactobacillus adhesion to saliva-coated surfaces. CONCLUSION: The present results showed significant variations in the adhesion capacity of the Lactobacillus strains studied. Adhesion to oral surfaces is of primary importance for bacterial colonization in the mouth. Only one of the L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus dairy starter culture strains investigated had a high adhesion percentage. This strain might then be considered for further investigations in the oral environment.
TI  - Anti-cariogenic effects of polyphenols from plant stimulant beverages (cocoa, coffee, tea).
AB  - Polyphenols occurring in cocoa, coffee and tea can have a role in the prevention  of cariogenic processes, due to their antibacterial action. Cocoa polyphenol pentamers significantly reduce biofilm formation and acid production by Streptococcus mutans and S. sanguinis. In the same way, trigonelline, caffeine and chlorogenic acid occurring in green and roasted coffee interfere with S. mutans adsorption to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads. Studies carried out on green, oolong and black tea indicate that tea polyphenols exert an anti-caries effect via an anti-microbial mode-of-action, and galloyl esters of (-)-epicatechin, (-)-epigallocatechin and (-)-gallocatechin show increasing antibacterial activities. The anti-cariogenic effects against alpha-haemolytic streptococci showed by polyphenols from cocoa, coffee, and tea suggest further studies to a possible application of these beverages in the prevention of pathogenesis of dental caries.
TI  - In vitro adherence of oral streptococci to zirconia core and veneering glass-ceramics.
AB  - Plaque formation on dental ceramics may cause gingival inflammation and secondary caries. This in vitro study compared the susceptibility of various dental ceramics to adhere oral streptococci, and verified the influence of substratum surface roughness and surface hydrophobicity. Three zirconia ceramic materials and three veneering glass-ceramics were investigated. Fifteen test specimens were prepared for each material, polished, and surface roughness and hydrophobicity were determined. After incubation with artificial saliva (2 h, 37 degrees C) for pellicle formation, specimens were incubated with suspensions of Streptococcus gordonii DSMZ 6777, Streptococcus mutans DSMZ 20523, Streptococcus oralis DSMZ 20627, or Streptococcus sanguinis DSMZ 20068, respectively, for 2.5 h at 37 degrees C. Adherent bacteria were quantified using a fluorescence dye for viable cell quantification (Alamar Blue/Resazurin). Statistical analysis was performed using one- and two-way ANOVA and the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test for post hoc analysis (alpha < 0.05). Surface roughness and surface hydrophobicity differed significantly among the various ceramics; protein coating hydrophilized the surfaces, and led to a homogenization of the surface hydrophobicity of the various ceramics. Before protein coating, almost similar relative fluorescence intensities indicating similar adhesion of streptococci were found for the various ceramics; more distinct differences were observed after protein coating. Correlations between surface parameters and streptococcal adhesion were poor. Within the limitations of these experiments, the findings of this in vitro study indicate only little differences between zirconia and glass ceramic with regard to streptococcal adhesion. Judging from these results, it is unlikely that exposed zirconia surfaces yield more plaque than glass ceramic surfaces in vivo.
TI  - Activity of panduratin A isolated from Kaempferia pandurata Roxb. against multi-species oral biofilms in vitro.
AB  - The formation of dental biofilm caused by oral bacteria on tooth surfaces is the  primary step leading to oral diseases. This study was performed to investigate the preventive and reducing effects of panduratin A, isolated from Kaempferia pandurata Roxb., against multi-species oral biofilms consisting of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis and Actinomyces viscosus. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of panduratin A was determined by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution assay. Prevention of biofilm formation was performed on 96-well microtiter plates by coating panduratin A in mucin at 0.5-40 microg/ml, followed by biofilm formation at 37 degrees C for 24 h. The reducing effect on the preformed biofilm was tested by forming the biofilm at 37 degrees C for 24 h, followed by treatment with panduratin A at 0.2-10 microg/ml for up to 60 min. Panduratin A showed a MIC of 1 microg/ml for multi-species strains. Panduratin A at 2 x MIC for 8 h exhibited bactericidal activity against multi-species planktonic cells for 8 h. At 8 x MIC, panduratin A was able to prevent biofilm formation by > 50%. Biofilm mass was reduced by > 50% after exposure to panduratin A at 10 microg/ml for 15 min. Panduratin A showed a dose-dependent effect in preventing and reducing the biofilm. These results suggest that panduratin A is applicable as a natural anti-biofilm agent to eliminate oral bacterial colonization during early dental plaque formation.
TI  - Correlations of oral bacterial arginine and urea catabolism with caries experience.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Alkali generation by oral bacteria plays a key role in plaque pH  homeostasis and may be a major impediment to the development of dental caries. To determine if the capacity of oral samples to produce ammonia from arginine or urea was related to caries experience, the arginine deiminase system (ADS) and urease activity in saliva and dental plaque samples were measured in 45 adult subjects. METHODS: The subjects were divided into three groups according to caries status; 13 caries-free (CF) individuals (decayed, missing, and filled teeth = 0); 21 caries-active (CA) individuals (decayed teeth >or= 4); and 11 caries-experienced (CE) individuals (decayed teeth = 0; missing and filled teeth > 0). Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify the proportion of certain acid- or alkali-producing organisms in the samples. RESULTS: The amount of ammonia generated from the test substrates by plaque samples was generally higher than that produced by salivary samples in all groups. Significantly higher levels of salivary ADS activity and plaque urease activity were observed in CF subjects compared to CA subjects (P = 0.0004 and P = 0.014, respectively). The proportions of Streptococcus mutans from saliva and dental plaque of CA subjects were significantly higher than those from the CF group (P = 0.0153 and P = 0.0009, respectively). In the CA group, there was an inverse relationship between urease activity and the levels of S. mutans (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: This study supports the theory that increased caries risk is associated with reduced alkali-generating capacity of the bacteria colonizing the oral cavity; providing compelling evidence to further our understanding of oral alkali-generation in health and disease.
TI  - Bacterial profiles of oral streptococcal and periodontal bacterial species in saliva specimens from Japanese subjects.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Recent developments in molecular biological techniques have increased  understanding of the distribution of oral bacterial species in clinical specimens, though few investigations have been conducted to simultaneously detect oral streptococcal and periodontal species in the same specimens. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the distribution and correlation of 6 oral streptococcal and 6 periodontal species in saliva specimens taken from children and their mothers. DESIGN: Seventy-four pairs of children and their mothers were approved to participate in this study. Saliva specimens were collected and bacterial DNA extracted, which was subjected to PCR analyses using species-specific sets of primers. The combinations of species able to be detected simultaneously were determined by statistical analyses. RESULTS: Streptococcus sobrinus and Porphyromonas gingivalis were detected more often in the mothers than the children. Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Streptococcus oralis were detected simultaneously in a significant number of specimens, while the presence of Campylobacter rectus was correlated with the presence of at least one of the red complex species (P. gingivalis, Treponema denticola and Tannerella forsythensis). On the other hand, no correlation was shown between the rates of detection of oral streptococcal and periodontal species. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that among streptococcal and periodontal species, several are able to coexist in saliva, while the presence of both does not have an influence on each other.
TI  - Does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. METHODS: Bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (BOP) was recorded at sites sampled at the four time points. RESULTS: The mean BOP at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. The corresponding mean BOP at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). Total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (P <0.01). Increased bacterial counts over time were found for Neisseria mucosa (P <0.001). Lower counts (P <0.001) were found for Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Eubacterium saburreum, Fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, Fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, Leptotrichia buccalis, Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella melaninogenica, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Selenomonas noxia, and Veillonella parvula. No changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. Counts of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), and Treponema denticola did not change. Counts of P. gingivalis and T. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. P. gingivalis and T. forsythia counts were associated with BOP at week 12. A decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. Only counts of N. mucosa increased.
TI  - Distribution of selected cariogenic bacteria in five different intra-oral habitats in young children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the colonization patterns and composition of the oral microbiota can lead to a better understanding of disease initiation. AIM: The aim of this study was to examine the distribution of selected cariogenic bacteria in samples from five different oral habitats in young Greek children. DESIGN: Ninety-three children 3-12 years old (mean + SD 7.9 +/- 2.5) (60.2% male, 39.8% female) participated and split into three different age groups: primary (3-6 years), early mixed (6-9 years), and mixed dentition (9-12 years). Samples for bacterial enumeration were taken from saliva, supragingival and subgingival plaque, tongue dorsum, and soft tissues from each child, and were further analysed using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: Mean counts and proportions of all the test bacteria differed significantly among sample locations. Cariogenic bacteria were present in almost all healthy children. Mean proportions of Streptococcus mutans isolated from soft tissue and Streptococcus sanguinis from soft tissue, subgingival and saliva samples increased significantly with age, whereas the opposite was seen for Lactobacillus acidophilus. CONCLUSIONS: Cariogenic bacteria were present in almost all young children. Soft tissues, saliva, and tongue were more often colonized by cariogenic streptococcal species than teeth. These surfaces may serve as reservoirs for oral pathogens, requiring attention during preventive interventions.
TI  - Fluoride released from glass-ionomer cement is responsible to inhibit the acid production of caries-related oral streptococci.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Glass-ionomer cements (GICs) are known to have inhibitory effects on  bacterial growth, but the biochemical mechanism of this property has not been fully understood. This study aimed to evaluate inhibitory effects of GIC on the acid production of caries-related oral streptococci, and to identify the components responsible for the inhibition. METHODS: An eluate was prepared by immersing set GIC in phosphate-buffered saline at 37 degrees C for 24h. Fluoride and other elements in the eluate were quantified by fluoride ion electrode and atomic absorption photometry, respectively. Streptococcus mutans NCTC 10449 and Streptococcus sanguinis NCTC 10556 were used to evaluate the pH fall and the rate of acid production after the addition of glucose in the presence or absence of the eluate. Acidic end products from glucose were also assayed by carboxylic acid analyzer. RESULTS: The eluate contained silicon (1.24+/-0.26 mM), fluoride (0.49+/-0.02 mM) and aluminum (0.06+/-0.00 mM), and inhibited the pH fall and the acid production rate of both streptococci at acidic pH, with a concomitant decrease in lactic acid production. These effects were comparable to those of a potassium fluoride solution containing the same concentration of fluoride as the eluate. SIGNIFICANCE: These results indicate that the GIC eluate inhibits the acid production of caries-related oral streptococci at acidic pH and that the effect is due to fluoride derived from the GIC. Thus, adjacent to GIC fillings, bacterial acid production and the subsequent bacterial growth may decrease, establishing a cariostatic environment.
TI  - Effects of alpha-amylase and its inhibitors on acid production from cooked starch by oral streptococci.
AB  - This study evaluated acid production from cooked starch by Streptococcus mutans,  Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus sanguinis and Streptococcus mitis, and the effects of alpha-amylase inhibitors (maltotriitol and acarbose) and xylitol on acid production. Streptococcal cell suspensions were anaerobically incubated with various carbohydrates that included cooked potato starch in the presence or absence of alpha-amylase. Subsequently, the fall in pH and the acid production rate at pH 7.0 were measured. In addition, the effects of adding alpha-amylase inhibitors and xylitol to the reaction mixture were evaluated. In the absence of alpha-amylase, both the fall in pH and the acid production rate from cooked starch were small. On the other hand, in the presence of alpha-amylase, the pH fell to 3.9-4.4 and the acid production rate was 0.61-0.92 micromol per optical density unit per min. These values were comparable to those for maltose. When using cooked starch, the fall in pH by S. sanguinis and S. mitis was similar to that by S. mutans and S. sobrinus. For all streptococci, alpha-amylase inhibitors caused a decrease in acid production from cooked starch, although xylitol only decreased acid production by S. mutans and S. sobrinus. These results suggest that cooked starch is potentially acidogenic in the presence of alpha-amylase, which occurs in the oral cavity. In terms of the acidogenic potential of cooked starch, S. sanguinis and S. mitis were comparable to S. mutans and S. sobrinus. Alpha-amylase inhibitors and xylitol might moderate this activity.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of two Mineral Trioxide Aggregate materials in vitro evaluation.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: It has been documented that total removal of carious dentin, assessed according to clinical criteria, does not mean complete eradication of bacteria. For that reason in prevention of caries and pulp inflammations, application of the materials having high antibacterial properties seems to be indispensable. AIM: Determination of antibacterial activities of two white Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA) preparations against bacteria of the genus Streptococcus. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Antibacterial activities of the materials were determined by diffusion method on a solid tryptic-soy medium (Tryptic Soy Agar, Oxoid). Wells were prepared on the medium with a puncher of 7 mm diameter and 5 mm depth (four for each material). The bottom was poured with 10 microlitres of liquid TSA for sealing. Bacterial suspension was inoculated with cotton swabs onto the medium surface and then the wells were filled with the materials prepared ex tempore. The plates were left in room temperature for 30 minutes and incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. Results were read by measuring the inhibition zones on day 1, 2, 3 and 8 of the culture. RESULTS: All the study samples demonstrated inhibition of bacteria of the genus Streptococcus. The antibacterial effect of MTA was maintained till the end of the experiment (day 8). ProRoot White showed slightly larger inhibition zone against Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus sanguis as compared to MTA white Angelus. The mean inhibition zones against Streptococcus mutans appeared the same for both test materials. CONCLUSION: The two MTA preparations assessed in the current study show good antibacterial action against the standard strains Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus salivarius.
TI  - Pimarane-type diterpenes: antimicrobial activity against oral pathogens.
AB  - Seven pimarane type-diterpenes re-isolated from Viguiera arenaria Baker and two semi-synthetic pimarane derivatives were evaluated in vitro against the following main microorganisms responsible for dental caries: Streptococcus salivarius, S. sobrinus, S. mutans, S. mitis, S. sanguinis and Lactobacillus casei. The compounds ent-pimara-8(14),15-dien-19-oic acid (PA); ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-ol; ent-15-pimarene-8beta,19-diol; ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-acetoxy and the sodium salt derivative of PA were the most active compounds, displaying MIC values ranging from 2 to 8 microg mL(-1). Thus, this class of compounds seems promising as a class of new effective anticariogenic agents. Furthermore, our results also allow us to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to the discovery of new natural compounds that could be employed in the development of oral care products.
TI  - Phylogenetic analyses and detection of viridans streptococci based on sequences and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of the rod shape-determining protein gene.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Population analysis of viridans streptococci is important because these species are associated with dental caries, bacteremia, and subacute endocarditis, in addition to being important members of the human oral commensal microbiota. DESIGN: In this study, we phylogenetically analyzed the rod shape-determining protein gene (rodA), which is associated with cellular morphology, cell division, and sensitivity for antibiotics, and demonstrated that the diversity of the rodA gene is sufficient to identify viridans streptococci at the species level. Moreover, we developed a more convenient denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) method based on the diversity of the rodA gene (rodA-DGGE) for detecting nine dominant streptococcal species in human saliva, namely, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus parasanguinis, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus vestibularis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus sobrinus. RESULTS: This rodA-DGGE method proved useful in detecting viridans streptococci without cultivation, isolation, and phenotypic characterization. CONCLUSION: Analysis of the oral microbiota by rodA-DGGE offers a higher resolution than the conventional DGGE using 16S rDNA and may be an alternative in the microbial diagnosis of streptococcal infection.
TI  - Comparison of clustered, regularly interspaced short palindrome repeats (CRISPRs) in viridans streptococci (Streptococcus gordonii, S. mutans, S. sanguinis, S. thermophilus) and in S. pneumoniae.

TI  - [Preparation and antibacterial activity of quaternary ammonium salt monomers].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To prepare three quaternary ammonium salt (QAS) monomers, and to compare their antibacterial activities against four oral bacterial strains. METHODS: Three antibacterial monomers [methacryloxyethyl benzyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (DMAE-BC), methacryloxyethyl m-chloro benzyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (DMAE-m-CBC), methacryloxyethyl cetyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (DMAE-CB)] were synthesized according to the general structure of target monomers. Their antibacterial effects were investigated using the broth dilution test on Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains (Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella melaninogenica ). RESULTS: Three different monomers were successfully obtained. All the tested bacterial strains were susceptible to the three monomers, among which DMAE-CB exhibited the lowest minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) ranging from 1.2 to 4.8 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: All these three QAS monomers have different antibacterial activities against four oral bacteria strains. The data indicate that DMAE-CB may be a candidate antibacterial agent for oral infectious diseases.
TI  - [Initial study on the discrimination of oral microorganisms with a metabonomics method].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish the spectra of metabolites that coued be employed in identification of oral pathogenic bacteria, and try to find a convenient and rapid way to discriminate oral microorganisms. METHODS: Suspensions of Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556 and Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 with same density were preparecd and cultured respectively at improved TPY liquid culture medium. The growth quantity were measured periodically by a turbidimeter. And the growth curves of the inoculated bacteria were completed. The culture solutions in stationary phase of the three bacteria were tested with 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectroscopy respectively. The data of 1H-NMR spectroscopy results were analyzed by principal components analysis (PCA). RESULTS: The PCA showed the obvious clustering phenomena and the points of three group differentially centralized to three clusters. Therefore, the NMR-based metabonomics profiles could discriminate the three different kinds of bacteria. CONCLUSION: The metabonomics is a promising new technology for developing to a rapid discrimination method of oral pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Anticaries effect of compounds extracted from Galla chinensis in a multispecies biofilm model.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Galla Chinensis is a leaf gall known to have some antibacterial effects. Using an in vitro biofilm model of dental plaque, the present study aimed to evaluate the anticaries effects of Galla Chinensis and its chemical fractions. METHODS: A four-organism bacterial consortium (Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces naeslundii, Lactobacillus rhamnosus) was grown on hydroxyapatite (HA) discs, bovine enamel blocks, and glass surfaces in a continuous culture system and exposed to repeated solution pulses. Galla Chinensis extracts, sucrose solutions, and sodium fluoride solutions were pulsed into different flow cells. The pH value of the planktonic phase in each flow cell was recorded and the bacteria colonizing the biofilm on the HA discs were counted. Enamel blocks were observed using a polarized microscope and lesion depth was evaluated. The biofilm morphology was examined with a fluorescence microscope and the images captured were analyzed on an image analysis system. RESULTS: When Galla Chinensis extract, its chemical fraction, or fluoride was added to the sucrose solution, the planktonic phase pH remained higher than that in the sucrose alone. A lower level of colonization on the HA surface was also observed in the groups to which Galla Chinensis and fluoride were added compared with the control sucrose group, and this was reflected in both the total viable count and the biofilm imaging, which showed fewer cariogenic bacteria and a less compact biofilm, respectively. Enamel demineralization in both the fluoride group and the Galla Chinensis group was significantly less than that in the sucrose group. CONCLUSIONS: Galla Chinensis and fluoride may inhibit the cariogenicity of the oral biofilm. Galla Chinensis appears to be a promising source of new agents that may prevent dental caries.
TI  - Streptococcus cristatus attenuates Fusobacterium nucleatum-induced interleukin-8  expression in oral epithelial cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Oral epithelial cells may be invaded by a polymicrobial intracellular flora, including pathogens together with commensals. Various oral pathogens can induce the production of interleukin-8, a potent neutrophil chemotractant, in oral epithelial cells. Evidence from the gut suggests that commensal species may modulate inflammatory responses to pathogens. The aim of this study was to examine the interleukin-8 responses of oral epithelial cells to an oral pro-inflammatory species, Fusobacterium nucleatum, in combination with an oral commensal, Streptococcus cristatus. MATERIAL AND METHODS: KB, TERT-2, TR146 and SCC15 cells were cocultured with F. nucleatum and S. cristatus, either alone or in combination, at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 under various conditions. The mRNA expression of interleukin-8 was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and protein secretion was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: F. nucleatum alone evoked a potent interleukin-8 response, whereas S. cristatus alone did not induce significant interleukin-8 expression in oral epithelial cells. When present together, S. cristatus attenuated the F. nucleatum-induced interleukin-8 production in the four oral epithelial cell lines to varying degrees. The inhibitory effect of S. cristatus was independent of its viability and its co-aggregation with F. nucleatum, was not related to soluble bacterial products and appeared to require bacterial contact with epithelial cells. Similar effects were seen with several other species of oral streptococci. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that S. cristatus may exert immunomodulatory effects on the interleukin-8 response of oral epithelial cells to F. nucleatum challenge.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activities against cariogenic streptococci and their antioxidant capacities: A comparative study of green tea versus different herbs.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity against cariogenic bacteria, total antioxidant capacity and phenolic constituents of methanolic extracts from 11 herbs were investigated and compared with those of green tea (Camellia sinensis). Among the 12 tested herbs, eight herbal extracts could inhibit the growth of Streptococcus sanguinis. Jasmine, jiaogulan, and lemongrass were the most potent, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 1mg/ml, while green tea was less effective, with a MIC of 4mg/ml. Among them, only rosemary could inhibit the growth of S. mutans at a MIC of 4mg/ml. Total antioxidant capacities of herbal extracts were analyzed by three different assays, including 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH.) radical scavenging activity, trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC). Regardless of the assays used, green tea exhibited the highest antioxidant capacity, followed by osmanthus. Wide variations in total phenolics and total flavonoids of herbal tea extracts were observed. Chlorogenic acid was detected in high amount in honeysuckle and duzhong. These data suggest that rosemary is a potent inhibitor of oral streptococci, and green tea and osmanthus may be effective potential sources of natural antioxidants.
TI  - Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguinis colonization correlated with caries experience in children.
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the colonization of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguinis in the oral cavity and the association with severe early childhood caries (S-ECC). Saliva and plaque samples were collected from 14 S-ECC children and 8 caries-free (CF) children. All S-ECC children were S. mutans positive; 100% of CF children and 93% of S-ECC children were S. sanguinis positive. The children's caries severity was positively correlated with levels of S. mutans (p < 0.001), total oral streptococci (p < 0.01), total cultivable oral bacteria (p < 0.05), and children's age (p < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that the interaction of S. sanguinis with S. mutans was a significant factor associated with the caries status in children, suggesting that the relative levels of these two microorganisms in the oral cavity play an important role in caries development.
TI  - MLPA diagnostics of complex microbial communities: relative quantification of bacterial species in oral biofilms.
AB  - A multitude of molecular methods are currently used for identification and characterization of oral biofilms or for community profiling. However, multiplex PCR techniques that are able to routinely identify several species in a single assay are not available. Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) identifies up to 45 unique fragments in a single tube PCR. Here we report a novel use of MLPA in the relative quantification of targeted microorganisms in a community of oral microbiota. We designed 9 species specific probes for: Actinomyces gerencseriae, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Candida albicans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Rothia dentocariosa, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis and Veillonella parvula; and genus specific probes for selected oral Streptococci and Lactobacilli based on their 16S rDNA sequences. MLPA analysis of DNA pooled from the strains showed the expected specific MLPA products. Relative quantification of a serial dilution of equimolar DNA showed that as little as 10 pg templates can be detected with clearly discernible signals. Moreover, a 2 to 7% divergence in relative signal ratio of amplified probes observed from normalized peak area values suggests MLPA can be a cheaper alternative to using qPCR for quantification. We observed 2 to 6 fold fluctuations in signal intensities of MLPA products in DNAs isolated from multispecies biofilms grown in various media for various culture times. Furthermore, MLPA analyses of DNA isolated from saliva obtained from different donors gave a varying number and intensity of signals. This clearly shows the usefulness of MLPA in a quantitative description of microbial shifts.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of a new resin-based endodontic sealer against endodontic pathogens.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare the antimicrobial activities of a new resin-based SuperBond (SB) Sealer and five other sealers/cements against endodontic pathogens. The antimicrobial activities of SB Sealer, Sealapex, AH plus, Roeko Seal Automix, Canals N, and ProRoot mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) were examined using a double-layered method. The microorganisms Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus sanguinis were used. Live microorganisms were stained using triphenyltetrazolium chloride, and the zones of inhibition of microorganism growth were measured. The antimicrobial activity of SB Sealer was significantly lower than that of the other sealers, except for Pro Root MTA, against S. aureus, C. albicans, S. mutans, and S. sanguinis, but no activity against E. faecalis was detected. On the other hand, AH plus exhibited the highest antimicrobial activity. Pro Root MTA showed no antimicrobial activity against any of the microorganisms tested. SB Sealer offered no antimicrobial advantage over the other sealers tested except for Pro Root MTA.
TI  - Volatile components of Camellia sinensis inhibit growth and biofilm formation of  oral streptococci in vitro.
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of semi fermented and non fermented Camellia sinensis extracts (Black and Green tea) and comparison between them against Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, S. mitis ATCC 9811 and S. sanguis ATCC 10556 that are responsible for dental caries and bacteremias following dental manipulations. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of both tea extracts were assessed by Well diffusion and Broth dilution methods and examination of cell adherence (Biofilm inhibitory concentrations) was observed on glass slides under phase contrast microscope and colony counts from glass beads. Concentration of 1 mg mL(-1) of semi fermented tea extract was completely biofilm inhibitor but biofilm formation by these bacteria was seen 7 days after treatment with 1 mg mL(-1) of non fermented Camellia sinensis on glass beads and BIC for oral streptococci treated with this extract was 1.5, 2.5 mg mL(-1) of semi fermented and 3 mg mL(-1) of non fermented extracts had bactericidal effect on these bacteria. Semi fermented and non fermented Camellia sinensis extracts were able to prevent growth of oral streptococci. Therefore dental caries significantly reduce and the efficiency of semi fermented tea was higher due to rich content of volatile components rather than non fermented extracts.
TI  - Streptococcal adhesion to novel low-shrink silorane-based restorative.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to compare the susceptibility of one novel silorane-based and four widely used conventional methacrylate-based resin composites to adhere oral streptococci and to relate any differences to surface roughness, hydrophobicity and type of matrix. METHODS: Specimens of restoratives Filtek Silorane, Filtek Z250, Tetric EvoCeram, Quixfil and Spectrum TPH were prepared (10.0-mm diameter, 2.0-mm height). Surface roughness was assessed by perthometer measurements and hydrophobicity according to water contact angles was determined by computerized image analysis. Bacterial suspensions of Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus gordonii and Streptococcus mutans were incubated for 2.5 h at 37 degrees C with 15 test specimens for each material and adhesion was quantified with fluorescence dye Alamar Blue/Resazurin and an automated multi-detection reader. Glass served as reference. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney U-test (alpha=0.05). RESULTS: Median roughness values of all composites ranged between 0.04 and 0.11 microm, median contact angles between 59.7 degrees and 92.1 degrees. Significantly lowest fluorescence intensities of all test materials were found on Filtek Silorane for three of four streptococcal strains. The fluorescence intensities of the four conventional methacrylate resin composites were significantly higher and comparable among each other. SIGNIFICANCE: When compared against four conventional methacrylate composite resins, a general significance to a lower quantity of adhering streptococci was found on the novel silorane-based composite resin, which might result from its increased hydrophobicity. The low adhesion potential of the silorane-based composite may potentially improve the longevity of direct fillings and reduce recurrent caries.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of kaurane diterpenes against oral pathogens.
AB  - Two kaurane diterpenes, ent-kaur-16(17)-en-19-oic acid (KA) and 15-beta-isovaleryloxy-ent-kaur-16(17)-en-19-oic acid (KA-Ival), isolated from Aspilia foliacea, and the methyl ester derivative of KA (KA-Me) were evaluated against oral pathogens. KA was the most active compound, with MIC values of 10 microg mL(-1) against the following microorganisms: Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Lactobacillus casei. However, KA did not show significant activity against Streptococcus salivarius and Enterococcus faecalis, with MIC values equal to 100 and 200 microg mL(-1), respectively. Our results show that KA has potential to be used as a prototype for the discovery of new effective anti-infection agents against microorganisms responsible for caries and periodontal diseases. Moreover, these results allow to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to studies on the structure-activity relationship of this type of metabolites with respect to caries and periodontal diseases.
TI  - Effect of xylitol/chlorhexidine versus xylitol or chlorhexidine as single rinses  on initial biofilm formation of cariogenic streptococci.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Oral bacteria implying a natural resistance may deteriorate the antibacterial efficacy of chlorhexidine on cariogenic microorganisms. Xylitol, mostly applied via chewing gum, is known to possess favorable plaque-reducing properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a xylitol rinse formulated as pure solution or combined with chlorhexidine on the viability of Streptococcus sanguis (early colonizer of human teeth) and Streptococcus mutans (the most causal strain for caries) during initial steps of biofilm formation. METHOD AND MATERIALS: After exposure to the test solutions, the bacteria suspended in human sterile saliva were allowed to attach to human enamel slides for 60 minutes in a preclinical flow chamber system. The bacterial vitality of suspended and attached cells was monitored using 2 fluorescent DNA stains by epifluorescence microscopy. Further parameters measured were the total bacterial cell counts on enamel slides and growth of suspended streptococci. RESULTS: The sensitivity of S mutans to pure chlorhexidine or in combination with xylitol is contrary to the natural resistance of S sanguis to chlorhexidine. The combination of xylitol/chlorhexidine showed a statistically significant antivital effect on S sanguis cells compared to the pure agents xylitol and chlorhexidine. The bacterial cell density on enamel and bacterial reproduction on agar plates were similarly affected by the combination of xylitol/chlorhexidine or the single substances. CONCLUSION: The newly discovered synergistic antivital effect of xylitol combined with chlorhexidine may contribute to the favorable potential of xylitol use for the improvement of new formulations of caries-preventive mouthrinses.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of yoghurt against viridans streptococci in vitro.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Yoghurt consumption leads to a selective decrease in the oral level of mutans streptococci. It is not clear whether this decrease is due to the bactericidal activity of yoghurt or other mechanisms. The present study investigated the differences in susceptibility to yoghurt between several strains of viridans streptococci. DESIGN: The sources of variation were minimised, at the expense of the external validity of the study, using culture collection strains. Each strain was tested separately on five occasions in planktonic form and logarithmic growth phase. Two strains of each of the following Streptococcus species were tested: mutans, sobrinus, gordonii, oralis, parasanguinis and sanguinis. One millilitre [10(8) colony-forming units (cfu)] of each strain was incubated (37 degrees C, 60min) with 9mL of fat-free plain yoghurt containing Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus (10(8) and 10(7)cfu/g, respectively) in gently vortexed tubes. Survival rates were calculated every 15min by dividing the number of viable cells, obtained using conventional laboratory procedures, by the baseline number. RESULTS: Survival rates were 8% (S. mutans 6519T), 12% (S. mutans 31738), 35% (S. oralis 25671) and >50% (all other species tested) after 15min, and 0.01% (S. mutans) and >10% (all other species tested) after 30min. Overall, S. parasanguinis and S. sobrinus were the most resistant species. When heat-treated yoghurt (<10cfu/g bacteria and inactivated bacteriocins) was used, this antibacterial activity was not found. CONCLUSION: In vitro, yoghurt with live bacteria showed selective anti-mutans activity, suggesting that the overall decrease in mutans streptococci in vivo could be due to a bactericidal effect on S. mutans but not on S. sobrinus.
TI  - A quantitative approach to the effectiveness of ozone against microbiota organisms colonizing toothbrushes.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Toothbrushes are rapidly contaminated with different microorganisms,  which colonize the oral cavity and interdental spaces. This can represent a possible cause of infection or reinfection. In this study, the ozone experimental effect upon toothbrushes microflora was estimated microbiologically before and after saturation with ozone gas. METHODS: Fifty used toothbrushes coming from children and adults were entered our study. Microorganisms were enumerated and identified. Bristles from each brush were soaked in ozone saturated PBS solution for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min and the total microbial population was reassessed. RESULTS: Counts of microorganisms isolated per brush varied between 10(2) and 10(7) CFU. Candida albicans was present in used toothbrushes. No obligate anaerobes were isolated. Members of Streptococcaceae family were regularly found (65.2%) belonging to the following species: Streptococcus pyogenes, S. mutans, S. mitis, S. oralis, S. sobrinus, S. viridans, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Aerococcus viridans. A. viridans and S. mutans were more frequently isolated on children toothbrushes while Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis were found on adults brushes. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas sp. and Enterococcus sp., were also recovered. We found that the ozone treatment decreased gradually the microbial load. However, a bacterial re-growth was effective following short ozonation period. Decontamination was complete after an extended exposure to ozone for 30 min. CONCLUSIONS: Ozone application was found to remove the toothbrushes bristles microbiota following conventional brushing. Maximum decontamination efficacy of ozone treatment was observed after 30 min while exposure for short time periods seems to be inefficient which probably reflect the low dose of ozone used in this study.
TI  - Fluoride release and antibacterial activity of selected dental materials.
AB  - The aim of the study was to assess the fluoride ion release and antibacterial activities of the glassionomer cement Fuji IX and the compomer (composite modified polyacid) Dyract AP. Fluoride ion release was measured using direct potentiometry with an Orion fluoride ion selective electrode. The measurement was carried out after 1, 4, 7, 14, 30, and 60 days of storage in phosphate buffer at pH 6.8. The antibacterial activity of the materials was evaluated against the bacteria Streptococcus mutans ATCC 35668, Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 13419, Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556, and Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei ATCC 393. The agar diffusion test was applied. The material specimens were assessed twice: after setting and seven days later. Zones of bacterial growth inhibition were measured in millimeters after 24 hours. The results of the study showed that both materials released ion fluoride, with a higher emission of Fuji IX than Dyract AP. The highest level of emission was observed on the seventh day of the study in both materials. After 24 hours of bonding there was inhibition of bacterial growth by Fuji IX, whereas Dyract AP did not show similar activity. On the eighth day after polymerization, Dyract AP was significantly more active towards Streptococcus sanguis and salivarius.
TI  - Adhesion of oral streptococci to all-ceramics dental restorative materials in vitro.
AB  - In recent years, patients have benefited from the development of better and more  esthetic materials, including all-ceramics dental restorative materials. Dental plaque formation on teeth and restorative materials plays an important role in the pathogenesis of oral diseases. This study investigates initial adhesion of stationary phase streptococcal species to different all-ceramics dental restorative materials. The saliva-coated materials were incubated with the bacteria for 1 h in an in vitro flow chamber which mimics environmental conditions in the oral cavity. Number and vitality of adhering bacteria were determined microscopically after staining. Surface roughness and the composition of the materials had no distinctive influence on bacterial adhesion. However, S. mutans and S. sobrinus adhered about tenfold less numerous to all materials than the other streptococcal species. Further, there was a correlation between bacterial vitality and materials' glass content. The results showed that early plaque formation was influenced predominantly by the presence of the salivary pellicle rather than by material dependent parameters whereas the composition of the all-ceramics appeared to have influenced the percentage of viable cells during the adhesion process. This presented in vitro technique may provide a useful model to study the influence of different parameters on adherence of oral streptococcal species.
TI  - Streptococcal antagonism in oral biofilms: Streptococcus sanguinis and Streptococcus gordonii interference with Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Biofilms are polymicrobial, with diverse bacterial species competing for limited  space and nutrients. Under healthy conditions, the different species in biofilms maintain an ecological balance. This balance can be disturbed by environmental factors and interspecies interactions. These perturbations can enable dominant growth of certain species, leading to disease. To model clinically relevant interspecies antagonism, we studied three well-characterized and closely related oral species, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus sanguinis, and cariogenic Streptococcus mutans. S. sanguinis and S. gordonii used oxygen availability and the differential production of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) to compete effectively against S. mutans. Interspecies antagonism was influenced by glucose with reduced production of H(2)O(2). Furthermore, aerobic conditions stimulated the competence system and the expression of the bacteriocin mutacin IV of S. mutans, as well as the H(2)O(2)-dependent release of heterologous DNA from mixed cultures of S. sanguinis and S. gordonii. These data provide new insights into ecological factors that determine the outcome of competition between pioneer colonizing oral streptococci and the survival mechanisms of S. mutans in the oral biofilm.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect and pH of chlorhexidine gel and calcium hydroxide alone and  associated with other materials.
AB  - The purposes of this study were to evaluate the effectiveness of 2% chlorhexidine (CHX) gluconate gel, calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)2] and their combination with iodoform and zinc oxide powder as intracanal medications against select microorganisms, and to measure the pH changes caused by these medications. Antimicrobial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method. The zones of growth inhibition were measured and the results were analyzed statistically by Kruskal-Wallis test (p<0.05). The pH of the pastes was measured right after preparation, after 24 h and 1 week later. The largest mean zones of microbial inhibition were produced by 2% CHX gel, followed by Ca(OH)2 + 2% CHX gel + iodoform, Ca(OH)2 + 2% CHX gel, Ca(OH)2 + 2% CHX gel + zinc oxide, and Ca(OH)2 + water. The mean pH of all medications stayed above 12.0 during the whole experiment, except for CHX gel (pH=7.0). The results of this study showed that all medications had antimicrobial activity, but the most effective against the tested microorganisms were 2% CHX gel, followed by its combination with Ca(OH)2 and iodoform.
TI  - [Effects of oral streptococci on biofilm formation by cariogenic bacteria in dual species cultures].
AB  - The effects of oral commensal streptococci (Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mitis, and Streptococcus salivarius) on biofilm formation by cariogenic mutans streptococci (Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus) were investigated. Cell suspensions were cultured on 96-well microtiter plates coated with or without salivary components (SC), and in flow cell systems coated with SC in tryptic soy broth including 0.25% sucrose without dextrose (TSB). The resultant biofilm formations were stained using safranin or a LIVE/DEAD BacLight Viability Kit, and examined with absorbance at 492 nm or using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Mutans streptococci and S. sanguinis biofilms were formed significantly on the polystyrene surfaces in TSB. Further, in combination cultures, S. sanguinis formed a sufficient biofilm when cultured with S. mutans. However, when S. sanguinis was cultured with S. sobrinus, biofilm formation was slightly inhibited. S. gordonii also inhibited biofilm formation in the culture with S. sobrinus, but not when cultured with S. mutans. S. mitis and S. salivarius collapsed the biofilm morphology and inhibited volume development in some conditions when cultured with S. mutans or S. sobrinus. Biofilm formation by mutans streptococci was challenged and collapsed on the whole by culturing with each of the other oral streptococci. These results indicate that co-culturing of multiple species of mutans streptococci and other oral streptococci has physical effects related to previous attachment and colonization on the surface, as well as biological effects to regulate biofilm formation.
TI  - SMAP29 congeners demonstrate activity against oral bacteria and reduced toxicity  against oral keratinocytes.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cathelicidins are antimicrobial peptides found in epithelial and mucosal tissues as well as the secondary granules of neutrophils. SMAP29, a sheep cathelicidin, has differential antimicrobial properties against various pathogens, including periodontal organisms. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties and cytotoxicity of SMAP29, SMAP28, and three congeners (SMAP18A, SMAP18D, and SMAP14A). METHODS: The peptides at concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 250 microg/ml were tested for their activity against multiple strains of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Porphyromonas gingivalis using a radial diffusion assay. Cytotoxicity of keratinocytes was evaluated by measuring lactate dehydrogenase release after incubation with the individual peptides. RESULTS: SMAP28, thought to be the biologically active peptide, was the most potent antimicrobial (range of minimum inhibitory concentrations 0.06-7.03 microg/ml, P < 0.05); however, the activity of SMAP28 and SMAP29 was strongly associated (r = 0.933). The congeners also demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the bacteria tested (range of minimum inhibitory concnetrations 0.21-79 microg/ml). Overall, F. nucleatum was the most susceptible organism, while P. gingivalis was the least susceptible. Keratinocyte cytotoxicity was dependent on peptide length and dose. SMAP28 was the most cytotoxic, while SMAP14A was the least cytotoxic. CONCLUSION: The antimicrobial activities against oral microorganisms and the minimal toxicity seen in this study suggest that the congeners of SMAP29 may serve as an alternative to traditional antibiotics in the prevention and treatment of periodontal and other oral diseases.
TI  - Bacterial and Candida albicans adhesion on rapid prototyping-produced 3D-scaffolds manufactured as bone replacement materials.
AB  - Rapid prototyping (RP)-produced scaffolds are gaining increasing importance in scaffold-guided tissue engineering. Microbial adhesion on the surface of replacement materials has a strong influence on healing and long-term outcome. Consequently, it is important to examine the adherence of microorganisms on RP-produced scaffolds. This research focussed on manufacturing of scaffolds by 3D-bioplotting and examination of their microbial adhesion characteristics. Tricalciumphosphate (TCP), calcium/sodium alginate, and poly(lactide-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) constructs were produced and used to study the adhesion of dental pathogens. Six oral bacterial strains, one Candida strain and human saliva were used for the adhesion studies. The number of colony forming units (CFU) were determined and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) were performed. Microorganisms adhered to all scaffolds. All strains, except for Streptococcus oralis, adhered best to PLGA scaffolds. Streptococcus oralis adhered to each of the biomaterials equally. Streptococcus mutans and Enterococcus faecalis adhered best to PLGA scaffolds, followed by alginate and TCP. Prevotella nigrescens, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Streptococcus sanguis, and Candida albicans showed the highest adherence to PLGA, followed by TCP and alginate. In contrast, the microorganisms of saliva adhered significantly better to TCP, followed by PLGA and alginate. SEM observations correlated with the results of the CFU determinations. CLSM detected bacteria within deeper sheets of alginate. In conclusion, because of the high adherence rate of oral pathogens to the scaffolds, the application of these biomaterials for bone replacement in oral surgery could result in biomaterial-related infections. Strategies to decrease microbial adherence and to prevent infections due to oral pathogens are discussed.
TI  - [Effects of traditional Chinese medicine on oral bacteria biofilm].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of compounds of Galla chinensis extract (GCE) and Nidus vespae extract-1 (WVE1) on oral bacteria biofilm structure and activity and to determine the possibility of caries prevention by the compounds. METHODS: The morphology and activity of treated-oral bacterial biofilm and untreated-oral bacterial biofilm were observed by using fluorescence microscope in combination of idio-fluorochrome to label the died and living bacteria. The visible light semiquantitative method was used to measure biomass glucosyltransferase (GTF, A620) values and to determine the effects of active compounds of GCE and NVE1 on GTF of oral bacteria biofilm. RESULTS: The living bacteria in the untreated 24 h bacterial biofilm was dominant, and only a small number of died bacteria were found, the biofilm structure was regular and clear. GCE, GCE-B and NVE1 could inhibit the bacteria in the dental biofilm, which showed significant difference with the negative control. GCE and NVE1 could also inhibit GTF activity of 24 h bacterial biofilm in comparison with the negative control. CONCLUSIONS: The traditional Chinese medicine Galla chinensis and Nidus vespae could not only inhibit bacteria growth on oral bacterial biofilm, but also function by adjusting biofilm structure, composition and GTF activity of 24 h bacterial biofilm.
TI  - Microflora in oral ecosystems in subjects with radiation-induced hyposalivation.
AB  - AIM: To analyse the microbial flora in specific oral sites in 13 dentate subjects, 6-8 months after completed radiation therapy (RT group) and in 13 matched controls. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The microflora on the tongue, buccal mucosa, vestibulum, supragingival plaque and subgingival region was analysed using duplicate sampling and cultivation technique. A clinical examination was also performed. RESULTS: Candida albicans was found in one or more sites in 54% of the RT subjects and in 15% of the controls. In three RT subjects, C. albicans was found at all four sites analysed. An unexpected finding was that enterococci were found in all RT subjects and in high number in 38%. None of the controls harboured enterococci. In supragingival plaque, Lactobacillus spp. were detected in 92% of the RT subjects and the number and proportion of Lactobacillus spp. were extremely high compared with the controls. Mutans streptococci were detected in high numbers in 31% of the RT subjects, while they were not detected in 23%. CONCLUSION: The microbial results explain why some RT subjects have an increased susceptibility to oral diseases and stress that site-specific microbial analysis is an important diagnostic tool when planning oral health preventive care for RT subjects.
TI  - The utility of affinity-tags for detection of a streptococcal protein from a variety of streptococcal species.
AB  - There is no systematic examination of affinity tag utility in Gram-positive bacteria, which limits the investigation of protein function in this important group of bacteria as specific antibodies for many of native proteins are generally not available. In this study, we utilized an E. coli-streptococcal shuttle vector pVT1666 and constructed two sets of expression plasmids pVPT-CTag and pVPT-NTag, with each set containing five affinity tags (GST, GFP, HSV, T7 and Nano) that can be fused to either the C- or N-terminus of a target protein. A putative glycosyltransferase (Gtf2) essential for Fap1 glycosylation was used to demonstrate the utility of the cassettes in detection of Gtf2 fusion proteins, and the biological relevance of the proteins in our working strain Streptococcus parasanguinis. GFP and T7 tags were readily expressed in S. parasanguinis as either an N- or C-terminal fusion to Gtf2. Only the C- terminal fusion of GST and HSV were able to be identified in S. parasanguinis. The Nano tag was not detected in either E. coli or S. parasanguinis. Genetic complementation experiments indicated that all the tagged Gtf2 fusion proteins could restore the Gtf2 function in the null mutant except for the Nano-tagged Gtf2 at its N-terminal fusion. Using a T7-tagged Gtf2 fusion construct, we demonstrated that the fusion cassette is also useful in detection of the fusion tag expression in other streptococci including S. mutans, S. pneumoniae and S. sanguinis. Therefore, the expression cassettes we constructed will be a useful tool not only to investigate protein-protein interactions in Fap1 biogenesis in S. parasanguinis, but also to study protein functions in other gram-positive bacteria in which pVT1666 replicates.
TI  - Effect of cigarette smoke exposure on the growth of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis: an in vitro study.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of cigarette smoke on the growth of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis. The standard strains of S. mutans (ATCC 25175) and S. sanguis (ATCC 10556) were cultured on blood agar and incubated for 48 hr in three main environments: atmospheric air, carbon dioxide, and cigarette smoke. Kent gold 1(nicotine: 0.1 mg, tar: 1 mg), Kent lights (nicotine: 0.8 mg, tar: 9 mg) and Bahman (nicotine: 1 mg, tar: 13 mg) were the brands used in the present study. Afterwards, digital photographs of the colonies were taken and the diameter of colonies was measured. Data were analyzed using Post Hoc and General Linear Model statistical tests. Cigarette smoke and carbon dioxide environments significantly increased the growth of S. mutans. However, high nicotine/tar content cigarette smoke (Bahman) had the greatest impact on S. mutans and S. sanguis. The mutans/sanguis ratio, which was 0.71 in atmospheric air, increased to 1.07 in the presence of carbon dioxide. Kent gold 1, Kent lights, and Bahman demonstrated a mutans/sanguis ratio of 1, 0.84, and 0.98 respectively. In conclusion, it seems that the growth of S. sanguis and S. mutans is accelerated in the vicinity of cigarette smoke.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Mahonia aquifolium and two of its alkaloids against oral bacteria.
AB  - Extracts or alkaloids isolated from Mahonia aquifolium exhibit antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. In this study the bacteriostatic and bacteriocidal activities of a M. aquifolium extract and two of its major alkaloids, berberine chloride and oxyacanthine sulphate, were tested in vitro against nine different oral bacteria. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were in the range from < or = 0.0031% to 0.1993% for the M. aquifolium extract, from 0.002% to > 0.125% for berberine chloride, and from 0.0156% to > 0.0625% for oxyacanthine sulphate. The values for the minimum bactericidal concentrations were in the same range, indicating that the test substances most probably acted in a bactericidal manner. The most susceptible bacterium against all three test substances was Porphyromonas gingivalis.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of triterpene acids and semi-synthetic derivatives against oral pathogens.
AB  - Triterpene acids (ursolic, oleanoic, gypsogenic, and sumaresinolic acids) isolated from Miconia species, along with a mixture of ursolic and oleanolic acids and a mixture of maslinic and 2-a-hydroxyursolic acids, as well as ursolic acid derivatives were evaluated against the following microorganisms: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sobrinus, and Enterococcus faecalis, which are potentially responsible for the formation of dental caries in humans. The microdilution method was used for the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) during the evaluation of the antibacterial activity. All the isolated compounds, mixtures, and semi-synthetic derivatives displayed activity against all the tested bacteria, showing that they are promising antiplaque and anticaries agents. Ursolic and oleanolic acids displayed the most intense antibacterial effect, with MIC values ranging from 30 microg/mL to 80 microg/mL. The MIC values of ursolic acid derivatives, as well as those obtained for the mixture of ursolic and oleanolic acids showed that these compounds do not have higher antibacterial activity when compared with the activity observed with either ursolic acid or oleanolic acid alone. With regard to the structure-activity relationship of triterpene acids and derivatives, it is suggested that both hydroxy and carboxy groups present in the triterpenes are important for their antibacterial activity against oral pathogens.
TI  - Raman spectroscopic measurement of relative concentrations in mixtures of oral bacteria.
AB  - Near-infrared Raman spectroscopy has been used for species identification of pure microbial specimens for more than a decade. More recently, this optical method has been extended to the analysis of specimens containing multiple species. In this report, we demonstrate rapid, reagent-free quantitative analysis of a simplified model of oral plaque containing three oral bacteria species, S. mutans, S. sanguis, and S. gordonii, using near-infrared Raman spectroscopy. Raman spectra were acquired from bacterial mixtures in 200 seconds. A prediction model was calibrated by the partial least squares method and validated by additional samples. On a scale from 0 to 1, relative fractions of each species could be predicted with a root mean square error of 0.07. These results suggest that near-infrared Raman spectroscopy is potentially useful in quantification of microbial mixtures in general and oral plaques in particular.
TI  - Adhesion of Streptococcus mutans to different types of brackets.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the difference in the adhesion of Streptococcus mutans to three different types of orthodontic brackets and the effect of the presence of an early salivary pellicle and Streptococcus sanguis on adhesion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three adhesion experiments were performed using stainless steel, ceramic, and plastic orthodontic brackets. In the first experiment a clinical strain of S mutans adhered to the three different types of brackets (n = 6 for each). For the second, the brackets were treated with saliva before adhesion of S mutans (n = 6 per type of bracket). Finally, the third experiment concerned saliva coated brackets (n = 6 per type of bracket), but before S mutans, S sanguis bacteria were allowed to adhere. The bacteria were always allowed to adhere for 90 minutes in all the experiments. Adhesion was quantitated by a microbial culture technique by treating the brackets with adhering bacteria with trypsin and enumerating the total viable counts of bacteria recovered after cultivation. RESULTS: There were consistently no differences in the adherence to stainless steel, ceramic, or plastic brackets. The presence of an early salivary pellicle and S sanguis reduced the number of adhering S mutans to all three types of brackets. CONCLUSIONS: Adhesion of bacteria to orthodontic brackets depends on several factors. The presence of a salivary pellicle and other bacterial species seem to have a significant effect on the adhesion of S mutans, reducing their numbers and further limiting any differences between types of brackets.
TI  - The effect of mango and neem extract on four organisms causing dental caries: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivavius, Streptococcus mitis, and Streptococcus sanguis: an in vitro study.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Chewing twigs of the mango or neem tree is a common way of cleaning the teeth in the rural and semi-urban population. These twigs are also believed to possess medicinal properties. The present study was conducted to evaluate the antimicrobial effects of these chewing sticks on the microorganisms Streptococcus mutans , Streptococcus salivarius , Streptococcus mitis , and Streptococcus sanguis which are involved in the development of dental caries. An additional objective was to identify an inexpensive, simple, and effective method of preventing and controlling dental caries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sticks were sun dried, ground into a coarse powder, and weighed into 5 gm, 10 gm, and 50 gm amounts. These were added to 100 ml of deionized distilled water. After soaking for 48 h at 4 degrees C, the water was filtered. The filtrate was inoculated onto blood agar plates containing individual species of microorganisms and incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 h. RESULTS: Mango extract, at 50% concentration, showed maximum zone of inhibition on Streptococcus mitis . Neem extract produced the maximum zone of inhibition on Streptococcus mutans at 50% concentration. Even at 5% concentration neem extract showed some inhibition of growth for all the four species of organisms. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSION: A combination of neem and mango chewing sticks may provide the maximum benefit. We recommend the use of both the chewing sticks.
TI  - In vitro anti-biofilm activity of macelignan isolated from Myristica fragrans Houtt. against oral primary colonizer bacteria.
AB  - In early dental plaque formation, oral primary colonizers such as Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis and Actinomyces viscosus are initially attached to the pellicle-coated tooth surface to form a biofilm. The study aimed to determine the efficacy of macelignan, isolated from nutmeg (Myristica fragrans Houtt.), in removing each single oral primary biofilm in vitro on a polystyrene 96-well microtiter plate. Four biofilm growth phases (4, 12, 20 and 24 h) were evaluated in this study after treatment with macelignan at various concentrations (0.2, 2 and 10 microg/mL) and exposure times (5, 10 and 30 min). Anti-biofilm activity of macelignan was measured as the percentage of the remaining biofilm absorbance after macelignan treatment in comparison with the untreated control. At 24 h of biofilm growth, S. mutans, A. viscosus and S. sanguis biofilms were reduced by up to 30%, 30% and 38%, respectively, after treatment with 10 microg/mL macelignan for 5 min. Increasing the treatment time to 30 min resulted in a reduction of more than 50% of each of the single primary biofilms. The results indicate that macelignan is a potent natural anti-biofilm agent against oral primary colonizers.
TI  - In vitro inhibition of oral streptococci binding to the acquired pellicle by algal lectins.
AB  - AIMS: The initial colonization of the tooth by streptococci involves their attachment to adsorbed components of the acquired pellicle. Avoiding this adhesion may be successful in preventing caries at early stages. Salivary mucins are glycoproteins that when absorbed onto hydroxyapatite may provide binding sites for certain bacteria. Algal lectins may be especially interesting for oral antiadhesion trials because of their great stability and high specificity for mucins. This work aimed to evaluate the potential of two algal lectins to inhibit the adherence of five streptococci species to the acquired pellicle in vitro. METHODS AND RESULTS: The lectins used were extracted from Bryothamnion triquetrum (BTL) and Bryothamnion seaforthii (BSL). Fluorescence microscopy was applied to visualize the ability of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled lectins to attach to the pellicle and revealed a similar capability for both lectins. Streptococcal adherence assays were performed using saliva-coated microtitre plates. BSL inhibited more than 75% of Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sobrinus and Streptococcus mutans adherence, achieving 92% to the latter. BTL only obtained statistically significant results on S. mitis and S. sobrinus, whose adherence was decreased by 32.5% and 54.4%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Algal lectins are able to inhibit streptococcal adherence. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Our results support the proposed application of lectins in antiadhesion therapeutics.
TI  - Plaque pH response to snack foods in children with different levels of mutans streptococci.
AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effects of some snack foods on plaque pH in children with different levels of mutans streptococci (MS). Six children, aged 9-12 years, with low (<10(4)) and 6 children, aged 10-12 years, with high (>106) numbers of MS/ml saliva participated in the study. Dental plaque pH changes, after the consumption of milk chocolate, sweet biscuit, instant noodle, sticky rice with banana and a 10% sucrose positive control were measured using pH-electrode. The measurements of plaque pH were made on forty-eight-hour accumulated plaque, at baseline to determine the resting pH of the fasted plaque and at time intervals of 2, 5, 10, 20 and 30 minutes after food consumption. The plaque pH curves, delta pH values and area under curve for pH 6.0 for each test food were determined. Plaque acidogenicity was more pronounced for the high-MS group at almost all test periods compared to the low-MS group with all test foods. The test foods were ranked according to maximum pH drop in about the same order in both groups as follows: 10% sucrose > milk chocolate > sweet biscuit > sticky rice with banana > instant noodle. The plaque pH also stayed below pH 6.00 for a longer period in the high-MS group with sweet biscuit, milk chocolate, and sticky rice with banana. Findings suggest that pH responses were more acidic in high-MS group than low-MS group.
TI  - Inhibition of bacterial adherence to saliva-coated through plant lectins.
AB  - In the present study, we evaluated the ability of lectin from Talisia esculenta (TEL) and a protein from Labramia bojeri seeds (Labramin) to inhibit adherence of microorganisms and exert antimicrobial effects. The minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of these proteins were determined using 5 species of bacteria: Streptococcus mutans UA159, Streptococcus sobrinus 6715, Streptococcus sanguinis ATCC10556, Streptococcus mitis ATCC903 and Streptococcus oralis PB182. In addition, an adherence assay was performed using these 5 bacterial species and sterile polystyrene microtiter plates coated with human saliva. Filtered protein solutions (6.25 to 100 mug/ml) were added to saliva-coated plates, and the plates were then incubated for 1 h at 37 degrees C. After incubation, the plates were washed, and a bacterial suspension (10(6 )CFU/ml) was then transferred to each plate, followed by incubation at 37 degrees C for 1 h (10% CO(2)). Adherence of bacteria to the acquired pellicle was visualized by staining with crystal violet, and absorbance was measured using a plate reader at 575 nm. Neither Labramin nor TEL, at any of the concentrations used, inhibited growth of any of the microorganisms. However, Labramin inhibited adherence of S. mutans and S. sobrinus. The present results indicate that Labramin is potentially useful as a biofilm-inhibiting drug.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of peroxide-based bleaching agents.
AB  - Antibacterial activity of 4 commercial bleaching agents (Day White, Colgate Platinum, Whiteness 10% and 16%) on 6 oral pathogens (Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus sanguinis, Candida albicans, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus) and Staphylococcus aureus were evaluated. A chlorhexidine solution was used as a positive control, while distilled water was the negative control. Bleaching agents and control materials were inserted in sterilized stainless-steel cylinders that were positioned under inoculated agar plate (n = 4). After incubation according to the appropriate period of time for each microorganism, the inhibition zones were measured. Data were analyzed by 2-way analysis of variance and Tukey test (a = 0.05). All bleaching agents and the chlorhexidine solution produced antibacterial inhibition zones. Antimicrobial activity was dependent on peroxide-based bleaching agents. For most microorganisms evaluated, bleaching agents produced inhibition zones similar to or larger than that observed for chlorhexidine. C albicans, L casei, and L acidophilus were the most resistant microorganisms.
TI  - [Effects of the active compounds of M. officinalis on cariogenic bacteria].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of the principal biologically active compounds of M. officinalis on the growth and acid generation of the main cariogenic bacteria. METHODS: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces viscosus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus were chosen as the experimental bacteria. The active compounds (Magnolol and Honokiol) were separated from M. officinalis and then the effects of the two agents on the growth and acid generation of the bacteria were assessed. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimal biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) of the test strains were determined by MBEC-Device. RESULTS: It was found that the growth of not only plantonic bacteria but also the biofilm were efficiently inhibited by Magnolol and Honokiol. The two agents could also inhibit the acid production of the test strains. CONCLUSION: M. officinalis may be an effective anti-caries agent, and further researches will be necessary to define its usefulness in this aspect.
TI  - Production of antagonistic substance by Eikenella corrodens isolated from the oral cavity of human beings with and without periodontal disease.
AB  - AIMS: Antagonistic abilities may confer ecological advantages for micro-organisms in competitive ecosystems. However, reports regarding this phenomenon in Eikenella corrodens are not available. METHODS AND RESULTS: Nineteen E. corrodens strains, isolated from the oral cavity of human beings without periodontal disease (n = 5) and with aggressive (n = 9) and chronic (n = 5) periodontitis, as well as a reference strain (E. corrodens ATCC23834), were evaluated for antagonistic activity. The following indicators were used: Porphyromonas gingivalis FDC381, Prevotella intermedia ATCC25611, Actinomyces israelii ATCC12102, Eubacterium lentum ATCC25559, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius ATCC27337, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans FDCY4, Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC10953, Streptococcus sanguinis ATCC10557, Streptococcus uberis ATCC9927, Streptococcus mutans IM/UFRJ, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC33591 and Candida albicans ATCC18804. All the strains showed antagonism against at least one of the indicator strains. This phenomenon was more frequently observed for strains isolated from patients with chronic periodontitis (36.4%), than those from healthy subjects (20.6%) and those with aggressive periodontitis (10.8%). CONCLUSIONS: The heterogeneous antagonistic spectrum exhibited by E. corrodens isolates suggests their ability to produce more than one antagonistic substance, whose ecological relevance is yet to be demonstrated. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first description of antagonistic compound production by E. corrodens and its relationships with the clinical status of the patients.
TI  - Development of species-specific primers for detection of Streptococcus mutans in  mixed bacterial samples.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans is the major microbial pathogen associated with dental caries in children. The objectives of this study were to design and evaluate species-specific primers for the identification of S. mutans. Validation of the best primer set, Sm479F/R, was performed using seven S. mutans reference strains, 48 ATCC non-S. mutans strains, 92 S. mutans clinical isolates, DNA samples of S. mutans-Streptococcus sobrinus or S. mutans-Streptococcus sanguinis, and mixed bacterial DNA of saliva samples from 33 18-month-old children. All of the S. mutans samples tested positive, and no PCR products were amplified from members of the other streptococci or nonstreptococci strains examined. The lowest detection level for PCR was 10(-2) ng of S. mutans DNA (c. 4.6 x 10(3) copies) in the test samples. The results of this study suggest that the Sm479F/R primer pair is highly specific and sensitive for identification of S. mutans in either purified or mixed DNA samples.
TI  - The microbiological profiles of saliva, supragingival and subgingival plaque and  dental caries in adults with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The relationships between suspected bacteria in saliva, yeasts in oral rinse, and supragingival and subgingival plaque versus root surface and coronal caries in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a non-diabetic group were explored. METHODS: One-hundred and five patients with type 2 diabetes and 103 non-diabetic subjects were recruited; their periodontal status, plaque index and magnitude of root surface and coronal caries were assessed. Saliva and an oral rinse were cultured for mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and yeasts. Toothbrush samples of supragingival plaque and curette samples of subgingival plaque were assessed for 17 bacterial species using the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. RESULTS: Type 2 diabetes patients had significantly more severe periodontitis, a higher plaque index and a higher prevalence and magnitude of root surface caries than non-diabetic subjects. Significantly more diabetic subjects had higher levels of Treponema denticola, Prevotella nigrescens, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus oralis and Streptococcus intermedius in their supragingival plaque than non-diabetic subjects. No significant difference was found for the organisms in saliva, oral rinse and subgingival plaque between the two groups. After adjustment for diabetic status, root surface caries was associated with an increased count of mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and yeasts in saliva and of Streptococcus mutans in supragingival plaque samples. Coronal caries was only associated with lactobacilli and yeasts in saliva. CONCLUSION: The number of cariogenic organisms in saliva and oral rinse estimated by culture demonstrated a stronger association with both root surface and coronal caries compared to those 17 species assessed with the checkerboard method in supragingival and subgingival plaque.
TI  - [Study of susceptibility of oral bacteria biofilm to traditional Chinese drug preventing caries].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Using MBEC-Assay to assay minimal biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) of Galla Chinensis and Nidus Vespae to oral bacterial biofilm. To set up traditional Chinese medicine susceptibility pharmacodynamic empirical study methods of oral bacterial biofilm. METHODS: Cariogenic bacteria strains were selected (Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556, Lactobacillus rhamnosus AC 413, Actinomyces naeslundii WVU 627) in this study. Extraction components of Galla Chinensis were GCE (aqueous extract), GCE-B (30% alcohol extract) and extraction components of Nidus Vespae were NVE1 (95% alcohol extract). (1) To observe oral bacterial biofilm formatiom in MBEC-Device at different time. (2) MBEC-HTP-Assay: The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) of GCE, GCE-B and NVE1 to oral bacteria strains were determined. RESULTS: Oral bacterial biofilm were readily formed on the lid of MBEC-Device under selected condition (observed by SEM). Oral cariogenic bacteria growing as plankton populations were sensitive to GCE, GCE-B and NVE1. To GCE, GCE-B and NVE1, oral cariogenic bacterial biofilm were 2-16 times less susceptible than growing plankton bacteria. GCE and GCE-B were the most effective medicine against oral cariogenic bacterial biofilm. NVE1 were effective in killing oral-bacterial biofilm at relatively high concentration. CONCLUSION: GCE and GCE-B were effective medicine against oral cariogenic bacterial biofilm. MBEC (minimal biofilm eradication concentration) can provide a relative accurate medicine concentration for clinical test.
TI  - Effect of 308-nm excimer laser light on peri-implantitis-associated bacteria: an  in vitro investigation.
AB  - Dental implants are becoming increasingly important in prosthodontic rehabilitation. Bacterial infections, however, can induce bone loss and jeopardize clinical success. Recent literature has demonstrated that infrared CO(2) laser light is suitable for the decontamination of exposed implant surfaces. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of 308-nm excimer laser irradiation on peri-implantitis-associated bacteria in vitro. In this study, a XeCl excimer laser (308 nm) was used (Summit Technology, Boston, USA). Both aerobe (Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, Actinomyces naeslundii) and anaerobe microorganisms (A. odontolyticus, Prevotella melaninogenica) were tested. According to previous studies, a constant energy of 0.8 J/cm(2) and a constant frequency of 20 Hz were used for all irradiations. Colony-forming units after laser irradiation were counted. Excimer laser irradiation showed significant influence on the growth of all microorganisms. As compared to S. mutans and S. sanguis, A. naeslundii demonstrated higher sensitivity to laser irradiation. Anaerobe microorganisms, in contrast, demonstrated that a total of 200 pulses were sufficient to reduce the replication of these germs for more than 99.9%. Excimer laser irradiation (lambda = 308 nm) can significantly reduce both aerobe and anaerobe microorganisms. Depending on the parameters chosen, 200 pulses are sufficient for sterilization. New studies are necessary to evaluate if this wavelength is more of value in the treatment of peri-implantitis than other wavelengths or conventional therapies.
TI  - Minimum inhibitory concentration of adherence of Punica granatum Linn (pomegranate) gel against S. mutans, S. mitis and C. albicans.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial effect of a Punica granatum Linn (pomegranate) phytotherapeutic gel and miconazole (Daktarin oral gel) against three standard streptococci strains (mutans ATCC 25175, sanguis ATCC 10577 and mitis ATCC 9811), S. mutans clinically isolated and Candida albicans either alone or in association. The effect of minimum inhibitory concentrations of the gels on the adherence of these microorganisms to glass was assessed in the presence of 5% sucrose, using increasing and doubled concentrations of the diluted solution of the gels ranging from 1:1 to 1:1024. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of adherence of Punica granatum L. gel against the test organisms were: 1:16 for S. mutans (ATCC), S. mutans (CI) and S. sanguis; 1:128 for S. mitis and 1:64 for C. albicans. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of adherence of miconazole against the same organisms were: 1:512, 1:64, 1:4, 1:128 and 1:16, respectively. In experiments with three and four associated microorganisms, the Punica granatum L. gel had greater efficiency in inhibiting microbial adherence than the miconazole. The results of this study suggest that this phytotherapeutic agent might be used in the control of adherence of different microorganisms in the oral cavity.
TI  - Role of Streptococcus sanguinis sortase A in bacterial colonization.
AB  - Streptococcus sanguinis, a normal inhabitant of the human oral cavity, has low cariogenicity, though colonization on tooth surfaces by this bacterium initiates aggregation by other oral bacteria and maturation of dental plaque. Additionally, S. sanguinis is frequently isolated from infective endocarditis patients. We investigated the functions of sortase A (SrtA), which cleaves LPXTG-containing proteins and anchors them to the bacterial cell wall, as a possible virulence factor of S. sanguinis. We identified the srtA gene of S. sanguinis by searching a homologous gene of Streptococcus mutans in genome databases. Next, we constructed an srtA-deficient mutant strain of S. sanguinis by insertional inactivation and compared it to the wild type strain. In the case of the mutant strain, some surface proteins could not anchor to the cell wall and were partially released into the culture supernatant. Furthermore, adherence to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads and polystyrene plates, as well as adherence to and invasion of human epithelial cells were reduced significantly in the srtA-deficient strain when compared to the wild type. In addition, antiopsonization levels and bacterial survival of the srtA-deficient mutant were decreased in human whole blood. This is the first known study to report that SrtA contributes to antiopsonization in streptococci. Our results suggest that SrtA anchors surface adhesins as well as some proteins that function as antiopsonic molecules as a means of evading the human immune system. Furthermore, they demonstrate that SrtA of S. sanguinis plays important roles in bacterial colonization.
TI  - Multiparameter assessments to determine the effects of sugars and antimicrobials  on a polymicrobial oral biofilm.
AB  - Clinical studies indicate relationships between dental plaque, a naturally formed biofilm, and oral diseases. The crucial role of nonmicrobial biofilm constituents in maintaining biofilm structure and biofilm-specific attributes, such as resistance to shear and viscoelasticity, is increasingly recognized. Concurrent analyses of the diverse nonmicrobial biofilm components for multiparameter assessments formed the focus of this investigation. Comparable numbers of Actinomyces viscosus, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mutans, Neisseria subflava, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans cells were seeded into multiple wells of 96-well polystyrene plates for biofilm formation. Quantitative fluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) examined the influences of dietary sugars, incubation conditions, ingredients in oral hygiene formulations, and antibiotics on biofilm components. Biofilm extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) were examined with an optimized mixture of fluorescent lectins, with biofilm proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids detected with specific fluorescent stains. Anaerobic incubation of biofilms resulted in significantly more biofilm EPS and extractable carbohydrates than those formed under aerobic conditions (P < 0.05). Sucrose significantly enhanced biofilm EPS in comparison to fructose, galactose, glucose, and lactose (P < 0.05). CLSM demonstrated thicker biofilms under sucrose-replete conditions, along with significant increases in biofilm EPS, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, than under conditions of sucrose deficiency (P < 0.05). Agents in oral hygiene formulations (chlorhexidine, ethanol, and sodium lauryl sulfate), a mucolytic agent (N-acetyl-L-cysteine), and antibiotics with different modes of action (amoxicillin, doxycycline, erythromycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin) inhibited biofilm components (P < 0.05). Multiparameter analysis indicated a dose-dependent inhibition of biofilm EPS and protein by chlorhexidine and sodium lauryl sulfate, along with distinctive inhibitory patterns for subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics. Collectively, these results highlight multiparameter assessments as a broad platform for simultaneous assessment of diverse biofilm components.
TI  - Tigecycline (GAR-936) activity against Streptococcus gallolyticus (bovis) and viridans group streptococci.
AB  - Viridans group streptococci including Streptococcus gallolyticus (formerly S. bovis) represent serious invasive pathogens often associated with endocarditis or sepsis among immunocompromised or cancer patients. Tigecycline (GAR-936), the first clinically studied glycylcycline, has a potent gram-positive activity with a potential treatment option for these streptococcal infections. The studied collection (848 strains) included 100 isolates each of Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis, and fewer strains of S. gallolyticus (98 strains) and Streptococcus mutans (50 strains). These strains were isolated from patients on 3 continents in the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program and tested for susceptibility and interpreted by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute broth microdilution methods and criteria (< or = 0.25 microg/mL for tigecycline per US Food and Drug Administration). Penicillin susceptibility rates for the entire collection varied from 61% (S. sanguis) to 98% (S. constellatus), and macrolide susceptibility was also compromised (49-88%; average, 69%). Tigecycline was active against all isolates tested, in contrast to tetracycline resistance rates of 8-66%, and highest for S. gallolyticus. In conclusion tigecycline was quite active against bacteremic isolates of viridans group streptococci species and S. gallolyticus with an overall MIC90 at < or = 0.06 microg/mL; the highest MIC was only 0.25 microg/mL.
TI  - In vitro anti-microbial and in vivo cytokine modulating effects of different prepared Chinese herbal medicines.
AB  - The toxicity, antimicrobial and cytokine modulating effects of herbal medicines in treating periodontal diseases were evaluated in this study. Using the broth dilution method and disc agar diffusion test, in individual and combined decocted preparations, different concentrations of Ching-Wei-San and its individual herbal components, Coptidis rhizoma, Angelicae sinensis radix, Rehmanniae radixet rhizom, Moutan radicis cortex, and Cimicifuga foetida, were tested for in vitro inhibitory effects on three well-known plaque-causing bacteria, Porphyromonas gingivialis, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus mutans, and two common pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The cytokine modulating effects were evaluated in Balb/c mice. The results suggested that one milliliter Ching-Wei-San at the 25,000 mg/mL concentration daily for the mice had significantly high levels in the liver function indexes in the 3-day acute toxicity test and in both the liver and kidney function indexes in the 28-day subacute toxicity test (P<0.01). The 250 mg/mL Ching-Wei-San is comparable to 250 mg/mL of tetracycline, and had similar inhibitory effects on the tested bacteria. Coptidis rhizoma (62.5 mg/mL) was the only individual herbal component to show 100% inhibitory effects. The mean cytokine ratios of IL-2, IL-4, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha in Balb/c mice treated with individual herbal components were shown to be different from each other. Ching-Wei-San modulated the immunity of mice, up-regulated IL-2, IL-4 and TNF-alpha, but down-regulated IFN-gamma. The effects of none of the individual herbal components alone can substitute for the cumulative effect of Ching-Wei-San.
TI  - The effect of saliva or serum on bacterial and Candida albicans colonization on type I collagen.
AB  - Colonization of Candida albicans on oral surfaces can serve as a reservoir for disseminated infections, such as aspiration pneumonia and gastrointestinal infection, particularly in the immunocompromised host. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of salivary and serum pellicles on C. albicans, Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, Lactobacillus and Actinomyces colonization on type I collagen, a major organic component of periodontal ligaments. The colonization potential of two isolates each of C. albicans, S. mutans and S. sanguis, and a single isolate each of Lactobacillus and Actinomyces to uncoated (control), saliva-coated or serum-coated type I collagen plates (surface area 143 mm(2), Cell Disk; Sumitomo, Tokyo, Japan) was examined using a bioluminescent adenosine triphosphate assay based on firefly luciferase-luciferin system. The results revealed that with mutans streptococci, a saliva pellicle was significantly more effective in promoting bacterial colonization compared with the pellicle-free collagen disc, and the serum-coated sample significantly inhibited the colonization of streptococci (anova; P < 0b01). In contrast, in the case of C. albicans, Lactobacillus and Actinomyces isolates, a serum pellicle was significantly more effective in promoting the colonization, followed by saliva pellicle and uncoated specimen (anova; P < 0b01). These results suggested that crevicular fluid rich in seruminous components would promote the colonization of Candida, Lactobacillus and Actinomyces on type I collagen as opposed to streptococci which showed greater avidity to saliva-coated collagen.
TI  - Resistance to acidic and alkaline environments in the endodontic pathogen Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study aimed to investigate the biochemical mechanisms employed by the endodontic pathogen Enterococcus faecalis to confer acid- and alkali-resistance and to compare these with the mechanisms of representative oral streptococci. METHODS: E. faecalis JCM8728, Streptococcus mutans NCTC10449 and Streptococcus sanguinis ATCC10556 were used to assess both acid- and alkali-resistance by examining: (i) growth in complex media; (ii) stability of intracellular pH (pH(in)); (iii) cell durability to leakage of preloaded BCECF (2',7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxy-fluorescein); and (iv) cell permeability to SYTOX-Green. RESULTS: Growth was initiated by E. faecalis at pH 4.0-11.0, by S. mutans at pH 4.0-9.0 and by S. sanguinis at pH 5.0-9.0. The pH(in) was similar to the extracellular pH in S. mutans and S. sanguinis at pH 5-10, while the pH(in) of E. faecalis was maintained at approximately 7.5-8.5 when extracellular pH was 7.5-10 and was maintained at levels equivalent to the extracellular pH when pH < 7.5. Cell membranes of E. faecalis were resistant to BCECF leakage when extracellular pH was 2.5-12 and to SYTOX-Green permeability at pH 4-10. The cell membrane durability to extracellular pH in E. faecalis was higher than that observed in the Streptococcus strains. CONCLUSION: Compared to S. mutans, E. faecalis was found to be equally resistant to acid and more resistant to alkalis. The results suggest that pH-resistance in E. faecalis is attributed to membrane durability against acid and alkali, in addition to cell membrane-bound proton-transport systems. These characteristics may account for why E. faecalis is frequently isolated from acidic caries lesions and from persistently infected root canals where calcium hydroxide medication is ineffective.
TI  - The effect of cocoa polyphenols on the growth, metabolism, and biofilm formation  by Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguinis.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine if cocoa polyphenols could interfere with  biofilm formation by Streptococcus mutans or Streptococcus sanguinis, and reduce acid production from sucrose by S. mutans. The antimicrobial activity of cocoa polyphenols was assessed against cariogenic (S. mutans) and health-associated (S. sanguinis) species by minimum inhibitory concentration assays. Cocoa polyphenol dimer, tetramer, and pentamer inhibited the growth of S. sanguinis, whereas the growth of S. mutans was unaffected. However, pretreatment of surfaces with cocoa polyphenol pentamer (35 microM) reduced biofilm formation by S. mutans at 4 and 24 h, whereas the effects on S. sanguinis were less consistent. In contrast, brief exposure of preformed biofilms to pentamer either had no significant effect or resulted in increased counts of S. mutans under certain conditions. Cocoa polyphenol pentamer (500 microM) significantly reduced the terminal pH, and inhibited the rate of acid production by S. mutans at pH 7.0. In conclusion, cocoa polyphenols can reduce biofilm formation by S. mutans and S. sanguinis, and inhibit acid production by S. mutans.
TI  - Expression of the short fimbriae of Porphyromonas gingivalis is regulated in oral bacterial consortia.
AB  - The Mfa1 protein of Porphyromonas gingivalis is the structural subunit of the short fimbriae and mediates coadhesion between P. gingivalis and Streptococcus gordonii. We utilized a promoter-lacZ reporter construct to examine the regulation of mfa1 expression in consortia with common oral plaque bacteria. Promoter activity of mfa1 was inhibited by S. gordonii, Streptococcus sanguinis and Streptococcus mitis. In contrast, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus cristatus, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Fusobacterium nucleatum did not affect mfa1 expression. Expression of SspA/B, the streptococcal receptor for Mfa1, was not required for regulation of mfa1 promoter activity. Proteinaceous molecule(s) in oral streptococci may be responsible for regulation of Mfa1 expression. Porphyromonas gingivalis is capable of detecting heterologous organisms, and responds to selected organisms by specific gene regulation.
TI  - Multiple exposures to chlorhexidine and xylitol: adhesion and biofilm formation by Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Growing evidence from clinical studies suggests that mothers using xylitol gums or lozenges have decreased levels of Streptococcus mutans (SM) and do not transmit these cariogenic bacteria as readily to their children. To begin to determine mechanisms for these clinical findings and to explore potential synergism of antimicrobial combinations, we studied the effect of multiple exposures of chlorhexidine (CHX) combined with copper gluconate (CG) or zinc gluconate (ZG) followed by xylitol (XYL) on the ability of SM to adhere and form biofilms. Cell suspensions of SM were exposed two times to CHX; CG; CHX plus CG; ZG; and CHX plus ZG, and then four times to XYL. Control cells were exposed six times to water or XYL or received no treatment. For biofilm assessment, glass slides were inoculated with treated cells, and numbers of bacteria were enumerated after 48 hours of incubation. To assess the ability of SM to adhere, microtiter plate wells coated with primary S. sanguinis biofilms grown in sucrose were inoculated with treated SM, and adhesion was determined. Cells exposed to CHX-XYL combinations exhibited significant but transient inhibition of growth. The multiple-exposure regimen groups showed significant decreases in the ability of SM to form biofilms (P < 0.05). However, the CHX-XYL group exhibited a much greater effect than the other treatment groups (P < 0.001). Adhesion studies revealed that none of the multiple-exposure regimens had a significant effect on adhesion of SM to primary biofilms of S. sanguinis. We concluded that significant inhibition of SM growth and subsequent inability to grow as biofilms in the presence of sucrose occurs after a staggered exposure regimen to CHX initially and then to XYL. This may help explain the clinical data showing the decreased levels of SM in mothers treated with CHX and XYL.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of glass-ionomer restorative cements and polyacid modified composite resin against cariogenic bacteria.
AB  
TI  - Streptococcus massiliensis sp. nov., isolated from a patient blood culture.
AB  - An unidentified strain of the viridans group of streptococci was isolated from a  human blood sample. It was distinguished from all other recognized species of the Streptococcus sanguinis group by several biochemical characteristics. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons clustered this strain with Streptococcus ferus (mutans group) but phylogenetic analysis based on rpoB and sodA gene sequence comparisons included it in the S. sanguinis group. The isolate showed 95.4 and 95.2 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to S. ferus and S. sanguinis, respectively, confirming it as belonging to a novel taxon, for which the name Streptococcus massiliensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 4401825T (=CIP 108498T=CCUG 49690T).
TI  - Human T-cell responses to oral streptococci in human PBMC-NOD/SCID mice.
AB  - We investigated cellular and humoral immune responses to oral biofilm bacteria, including Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus sobrinus, and Streptococcus sanguinis, in NOD/SCID mice immunized with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hu-PBMC-NOD/SCID mice) to explore the pathogenicity of each of those organisms in dental and oral inflammatory diseases. hu-PBMC-NOD/SCID mice were immunized by intraperitoneal injections with the whole cells of the streptococci once a week for 3 weeks. FACS analyses were used to determine the percentages of various hu-T cell types, as well as intracellular cytokine production of interleukin-4 and interferon-gamma. Serum IgG and IgM antibody levels in response to the streptococci were also determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. S. anginosus induced a significant amount of the proinflammatory cytokine interferon-gamma in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in comparison with the other streptococci. However, there was no significant differences between the streptococci in interleukin-4 production by CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells after inoculation. Further, S. mutans significantly induced human anti-S. mutans IgG, IgG(1), IgG(2), and IgM antibodies in comparison with the other organisms. In conclusion, S. anginosus up-regulated Th1 and Tc1 cells, and S. mutans led to increasing levels of their antibodies, which was associated with the induction of Th2 cells. These results may contribute to a better understanding of human lymphocyte interactions to biofilm bacteria, along with their impact on dental and mucosal inflammatory diseases, as well as endocarditis.
TI  - Effect of water-soluble reduced chitosan on Streptococcus mutans, plaque regrowth and biofilm vitality.
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of a newly developed  water-soluble reduced chitosan on Streptococcus mutans, plaque regrowth, and biofilm vitality. A 1.0%, water-soluble reduced chitosan, with pH ranging from 6.0 to 6.5, molecular weights between 3,000 and 5,000 Da, and 70% degree of deacetylation, was used. To determine antibacterial and antiplaque potency of chitosan, minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for S. mutans and S. sanguinis (formerly S. sanguis), short-term exposure to S. mutans, and clinical trial of plaque regrowth and biofilm vitality were conducted. Twelve dental students volunteered to participate in the 6-week, double blind, randomized clinical trial using the classical 4-day plaque regrowth design. The MIC of water-soluble reduced chitosan for S. mutans was 1.25 g/l. While the cells exposed to distilled water (DW) grew rapidly, with a maximum turbidity reached by 16 h postinoculation, S. mutans exposed to chitosan (5.0 g/l) exhibited a substantial delay in growth and reached a maximum turbidity by 32 h postinoculation. The chitosan solution reduced the plaque index and the vitality of the plaque flora significantly when compared to DW, but this was less than the reductions found with the positive control of 0.1% chlorhexidine solution. The water-soluble reduced chitosan exhibited potent antibacterial effect on S. mutans, and displayed a significant antibacterial and plaque-reducing action during the 4-day plaque regrowth.
TI  - Preparation and antimicrobial activity of gelatin microparticles containing propolis against oral pathogens.
AB  - Gelatin microparticles containing propolis ethanolic extractive solution were prepared by spray-drying technique. Particles with regular morphology, mean diameter ranging of 2.27 microm to 2.48 microm, and good entrapment efficiency for propolis were obtained. The in vitro antimicrobial activity of microparticles was evaluated against microorganisms of oral importance (Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Candida albicans, and Lactobacillus casei). The utilized techniques were diffusion in agar and determination of minimum inhibitory concentration. The choice of the method to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of microparticles showed be very important. The microparticles displayed activity against all tested strains of similar way to the propolis, showing greater activity against the strains of E. salivarius, S. sanguinis, S. mitis, and C. albicans.
TI  - Effect of penicillin resistance on presentation and outcome of nonenterococcal streptococcal infective endocarditis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Most cases of infective endocarditis are caused by nonenterococcal streptococci. The emergence of strains resistant to penicillin is increasingly recognized worldwide. This study sought to assess the effect of penicillin resistance on presentation and outcome of streptococcal endocarditis. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted in a single tertiary care hospital. RESULTS: Between August 1996 and December 2004, patients infected with nonenterococcal streptococcal endocarditis and known minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to penicillin were included in this study. A total of 62 cases were identified: 48 (77%) cases of the streptococcal endocarditis were caused by viridans streptococci. The most common species groups identified were Streptococcus mitis in 12 (19%) cases, Streptococcus oralis in 9 (15%) cases, Streptococcus sanguis in 7 (11%) cases and Streptococcus mutans in 7 (11%) cases. There were 36 male and 26 female patients with a median age of 46 years (range: 1-85). Twenty-two patients (35%) had peripheral embolization and 10 patients (16%) died in hospital. Twenty-eight (45%) of the 62 patients were infected with streptococcal strains of MICs > or =0.125 microg/ml to penicillin. Infection with streptococcal strains of MICs > or =0.125 microg/ml to penicillin was associated with a lower incidence of all-site embolization, but was not associated with higher mortality or increased frequency of surgery. CONCLUSIONS: High-level penicillin resistance of the streptococci responsible for endocarditis was increasingly common and medical therapy with vancomycin had a good response. Penicillin resistance was associated with a decreased risk of embolization, but was not associated with higher mortality.
TI  - Anticariogenic activity of macelignan isolated from Myristica fragrans (nutmeg) against Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The occurrence of dental caries is mainly associated with oral pathogens, especially cariogenic Streptococcus mutans. Preliminary antibacterial screening revealed that the extract of Myristica fragrans, widely cultivated for the spice and flavor of foods, possessed strong inhibitory activity against S. mutans. The anticariogenic compound was successfully isolated from the methanol extract of M. fragrans by repeated silica gel chromatography, and its structure was identified as macelignan by instrumental analysis using 1D-NMR, 2D-NMR and EI-MS. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of macelignan against S. mutans was 3.9 microg/ml, which was much lower than those of other natural anticariogenic agents such as 15.6 microg/ml of sanguinarine, 250 microg/ml of eucalyptol, 500 microg/ml of menthol and thymol, and 1000 microg/ml of methyl salicylate. Macelignan also possessed preferential activity against other oral microorganisms such as Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei in the MIC range of 2-31.3 microg/ml. In particular, the bactericidal test showed that macelignan, at a concentration of 20 microg/ml, completely inactivated S. mutans in 1 min. The specific activity and fast-effectiveness of macelignan against oral bacteria strongly suggest that it could be employed as a natural antibacterial agent in functional foods or oral care products.
TI  - Photosensitization of in vitro biofilms by toluidine blue O combined with a light-emitting diode.
AB  - In natural ecosystems, micro-organisms grow preferentially attached to surfaces,  forming matrix-enclosed biofilms. The aim of this study was to determine photodestruction levels in biofilms after subjecting them to photodynamic therapy. Biofilms of Streptococcus mutans, S. sobrinus, and S. sanguinis were grown on enamel slabs for 3, 5 or 7 d. Both the number of viable micro-organisms and the concentration of water-insoluble polysaccharides were analysed, and mineral loss (DeltaZ) analyses were performed on the enamel slabs. The antimicrobial potential of toluidine blue O (0.1 mg ml(-1)), associated with 85.7 J cm(-2) of a light-emission diode, was evaluated on the viability of 5-d biofilms. Both the number of micro-organisms and the concentration of water-insoluble polysaccharide increased with the age of the biofilms. A significant reduction ( approximately 95%) in viability was observed for S. mutans and S. sobrinus biofilms following photosensitization, with a > 99.9% reduction in the viability of S. sanguinis biofilms. In conclusion, a biofilm model was shown to be suitable for studying changes in bacterial numbers and enamel mineralization and for demonstrating the potential value of photosensitization in the control of in vitro biofilms.
TI  - [Predominant aciduric microflora related to fissure caries of the first permanent molars].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the aciduric bacteria in different stages of the fissure caries in order to determine potential roles of the microflora in the development of dental caries. METHODS: Plaque samples were taken from 10 incipient carious fissures of the first permanent molars. Plaque samples were also collected from sound fissures of the first permanent molars in 10 other subjects who kept caries free over the past 2 years and from the above 10 subjects. The predominant bacteria were isolated by using both the most probable method in media at pH7.0 and 5.2, and the conventional plating methods. Streptococcus spp. was identified by means of API 20 Strep commercial kit. RESULTS: S. mutans was the predominant aciduric bacteria infissures of caries-free children and more frequently recovered at neutral pH. Whilst, S. sanguis was predominant at pH5.2 in sound and carious of fissures of caries-active children. The proportion of Gram-positive rods at pH5.2 was 82%, significantly greater than that of 61% at pH7.0. CONCLUSION: The ecology of plaque is complex and the composition of microflora at each stage of caries could be different. The composition of bacteria was consistent with the changes of local pH in the plaque.
TI  - [Study of antibacterial effect of Galla Chinensis on the bacteria biofilm in chemostat].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the antibacterial effect of Galla Chinensis with that of chlorhexidine by means of chemostat and provide experimental foundation for caries prevention with Chinese medicine instead of chemicals in future. METHOD: A multispecies consortium biofilm (BF) model was construted in the chemostat. The growth-inhibition on bacterial biofilm coated on HA was investigated by means of the colony-forming units (CFU). Acid-inhibition was inspected by continual pH-recording in the flow cells. And the profile on the biofilm treated by both experimental medicines was observed with the scanning electromicroscopy (SEM). RESULT: Both of the experimental medicines could inhibit the growth of the BF bacteria. And Galla Chinensis had no obvious influence on the ecological composing of the BF bacteria. Both of the experimental medicines could inhibit the acid producion of experimental bacteria. But the final pH of Galla Chinensis was lower than that of chlorhexidine. A typical biofilm formed on HA was observed by SEM. Both of Galla chinensis and chlorhexidine could inhibit the production of extracellular matrix and make the BF profile on the surface of the HA clearer and simpler. CONCLUSION: Galla Chinensis had definite antibacterial effect. No obvious difference is found between Galla Chinensis (4 g x L(-1)) and chlorhexidine (0.5 g x L(-1)). Therefore, it is possible for Chinese medicine to gradually replace the chemical medicine in clinic and it will give a new choice for caries prevention.
TI  - [Comparison of Galla Chinesis and sodium fluoride on growth and metabolism of bacteria in biofilm model].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the antibacterial effect between sodium fluoride and Galla  Chinesis in bioflim model. To evaluate the feasibility of application of Gala Chinesis in the clinical practice of caries prevention. METHODS: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius and Actinomyces naeslundii had been chosen as the experimental bacteria. In the experiment, biofilmn model was constructed, and two agents were added in the media. After a period of continuous culture, the number of bacteria adhering on the HA disc was examed, the planktonic pH in the flow cell was recorded continuously, and the morphology of the biofilmn formed on the HA disc was observed by SEM. RESULTS: (1) Galla Chinesis could inhibit the growth of the four oral bacteria in the biofilm just as sodium fluoride. (2) Galla Chinesis and sodium fluoride could prevent the descent of the planktonic pH in the flow cell, but Galla Chinesis was less efficient than sodium fluoride. (3) The biofilms formed after application of Galla Chinesis and fluoride, but the bacterial cells had less matrix than those applicated with sucrose. CONCLUSION: Galla Chinesis is one kind of effective cariostatic natural agents.
TI  - Microbial risk indicators of early childhood caries.
AB  - The aim of this study was to use molecular identification methods, such as 16S RNA gene sequence and reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization, for identification of the bacteria associated with dental caries and with dental health in a subset of 204 twins aged 1.5 to 7 years old. A total of 448 plaque samples (118 collected from caries-free subjects and 330 from caries-active subjects) were used for analysis. We compared the bacteria found in biofilms of children exhibiting severe dental caries, with different degrees of lesion severity, with those found in biofilms of caries-free children. A panel of 82 bacterial species was selected, and a PCR-based reverse-capture checkerboard method was used for detection. A simple univariate test was used to determine the overabundance and underabundance of bacterial species in the diseased and in the healthy groups. Features identified with this univariate test were used to construct a probabilistic disease prediction model. Furthermore, a method for the analysis of global patterns of gene expression was performed to permit simultaneous analysis of the abundance of significant species by allowing cross-bacterial comparisons of abundance profiles between caries-active and caries-free subjects. Our results suggested that global patterns of microbial abundance in this population are very distinctive. The top bacterial species found to be overabundant in the caries-active group were Actinomyces sp. strain B19SC, Streptococcus mutans, and Lactobacillus spp., which exhibited an inverse relationship to beneficial bacterial species, such as Streptococcus parasanguinis, Abiotrophia defectiva, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus sanguinis.
TI  - Competition and coexistence between Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguinis in the dental biofilm.
AB  - The human mucosal surface is colonized by the indigenous microflora, which normally maintains an ecological balance among different species. Certain environmental or biological factors, however, may trigger disruption of this balance, leading to microbial diseases. In this study, we used two oral bacterial species, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguinis (formerly S. sanguis), as a model to probe the possible mechanisms of competition/coexistence between different species which occupy the same ecological niche. We show that the two species engage in a multitude of antagonistic interactions temporally and spatially; occupation of a niche by one species precludes colonization by the other, while simultaneous colonization by both species results in coexistence. Environmental conditions, such as cell density, nutritional availability, and pH, play important roles in determining the outcome of these interactions. Genetic and biochemical analyses reveal that these interspecies interactions are possibly mediated through a well-regulated production of chemicals, such as bacteriocins (produced by S. mutans) and hydrogen peroxide (produced by S. sanguinis). Consistent with the phenotypic characteristics, production of bacteriocins and H2O2 are regulated by environmental conditions, as well as by juxtaposition of the two species. These sophisticated interspecies interactions could play an essential part in balancing competition/coexistence within multispecies microbial communities.
TI  - Estimation of salivary bacteria capable of inhibiting and stimulating Streptococcus mutans and its correlation to dental caries and untreated carious teeth.
AB  - Bacteriocins are bacteriocidal proteinaceous molecules produced by the Gram-positive bacteria not active against the produced strain. Many investigations have revealed that certain bacteria using antibacterial or the inhibitory substance inhibit some other bacteria. A study was conducted in a group of 60 children to ascertain whether any correlation exists between the proportion of salivary bacteria inhibiting and stimulating Streptococcus mutans and the oral health indices (DMFT, deft and Community Periodontal Index of Treatment Needs). A definite inverse correlation was observed between the percentage of salivary inhibiting S. mutans and untreated carious teeth (UCT).
TI  - In vitro activity of daptomycin against clinical isolates of Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - We determined the activity of daptomycin, a recently FDA-approved antimicrobial agent, against clinical isolates of Gram-positive bacteria, including viridans group streptococci (16 Streptococcus mitis species group, 12 S. mutans species group, 9 S. anginosus species group, 8 S. sanguinis species group, 5 S. salivarius species group) from patients with infective endocarditis, 32 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 32 high-level penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, 38 vancomycin-resistant enterococci (including 1 linezolid-resistant isolate), and the following unusual Gram-positive bacteria: 3 Listeria monocytogenes, 4 Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, 9 Corynebacterium species, 10 Abiotrophia/Granulicatella species, 2 Rothia (Stomatococcus) mucilaginosus, and 4 Gemella morbillorum. Daptomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)(90) values for the viridans group streptococci, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, and Enterococcus species were 0.5, 0.5, < or =0.125, and 4 microg/ml, respectively. The daptomycin MIC range for the unusual Gram-positive bacteria was < or =0.125-2 microg/ml. We conclude that daptomycin has in vitro activity against viridans group streptococci associated with endocarditis as well as against several types of unusual Gram-positive bacteria that can cause endocarditis.
TI  - A synergistic chlorhexidine/chitosan combination for improved antiplaque strategies.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The minor efficacy of chlorhexidine (CHX) on other cariogenic bacteria than mutans streptococci such as Streptococcus sanguinis may contribute to uneffective antiplaque strategies. METHODS AND RESULTS: In addition to CHX (0.1%) as positive control and saline as negative control, two chitosan derivatives (0.2%) and their CHX combinations were applied to planktonic and attached sanguinis streptococci for 2 min. In a preclinical biofilm model, the bacteria suspended in human sterile saliva were allowed to attach to human enamel slides for 60 min under flow conditions mimicking human salivation. The efficacy of the test agents on streptococci was screened by the following parameters: vitality status, colony-forming units (CFU)/ml and cell density on enamel. The first combination reduced the bacterial vitality to approximately 0% and yielded a strong CFU reduction of 2-3 log(10) units, much stronger than CHX alone. Furthermore, the first chitosan derivative showed a significant decrease of the surface coverage with these treated streptococci after attachment to enamel. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, a new CHX formulation would be beneficial unifying the bioadhesive properties of chitosan with the antibacterial activity of CHX synergistically resulting in a superior antiplaque effect than CHX alone.
TI  - Differentiation of mutans streptococci by intact cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
AB  - It is difficult to distinguish mutans streptococci on the species level, and even more so on the subspecies level. Intact cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) (ICM) was applied to reference strains of five of the species of the mutans group (Streptococcus criceti, Streptococcus downei, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus ratti, Streptococcus sobrinus), nonmutans streptococci (Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus salivarius, and Streptococcus sanguinis), and 177 mutans streptococci isolated from saliva of 10 children. From the analysis of the reference strains, readily distinguishable ICM mass spectra were obtained for the different species. Based on multivariate statistical analysis, a correct and unambiguous assignment was made of the spectra of 159 isolated mutans streptococci to S. mutans and 16 isolates to S. sobrinus. Two isolates were sorted out and were identified by sequencing of their 16S rRNA genes as Streptococcus anginosus. In addition, ICM indicated a misclassification for some reference strains (AHT, V 100 and E 49) and re-classified AHT and E 49 as S. ratti and V 100 as S. sobrinus. This was confirmed by 16S rDNA sequencing. Based on a statistical similarity analysis of the spectra of reference strains and a quantitative assessment of the reproducibility of ICM, the isolates identified as either S. mutans or S. sobrinus were phenotyped on the subspecies level. In the population of the clinical isolates, 14 unambiguously different S. mutans and three different S. sobrinus phenotypes were detected. ICM proved to be a powerful tool for a differentiation of mutans streptococci down to the subspecies level.
TI  - [An in vitro study on effect of Nidus vespae extract on the acid production of three strains of oral bacteria].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To inquire into the effect of different of Nidus Vespae extract (NVE)  on growth and acid production of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis and Actinomyces viscosus. METHODS: Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556 and Actinomyces viscosus ATCC 19246 were chosen as the experimental bacteria. Four extracts of Nidus Vespae were prepared and then the effects of these Nidus Vespae extracts on the acid production were determined. RESULTS: All of Nidus Vespae extracts could inhibit the growth the of the three strains, and NVE1, NVE3, NVE4 could inhibit the acid production of the three strains, NVE2 could inhibit the acid production of Actinomyces viscosus. CONCLUSION: Four extracts of Nidus Vespae could inhibit the acid production of three bacteria strains.
TI  - Susceptibilities of periodontopathogenic and cariogenic bacteria to antibacterial peptides, {beta}-defensins and LL37, produced by human epithelial cells.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Antimicrobial peptides are one of the factors involved in innate immunity. The susceptibility of periodontopathogenic and cariogenic bacteria to the major antimicrobial peptides produced by epithelia was investigated. METHODS: Synthetic antimicrobial peptides of human beta-defensin-1 (hBD1), hBD2, hBD3 and LL37 (CAP18) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against oral bacteria. They included Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (20 strains), Porphyromonas gingivalis (6), Prevotella intermedia (7), Fusobacterium nucleatum (7), Streptococcus mutans (5), Streptococcus sobrinus (5), Streptococcus salivarius (5), Streptococcus sanguis (4), Streptococcus mitis (2) and Lactobacillus casei (1). RESULTS: Although the four peptides had bactericidal activity against all bacteria tested, the degree of antibacterial activity was variable against the different strains and species. The antibacterial activity of hBD1 was lower than that of the other peptides. Among the bacteria tested in this study, F. nucleatum was highly susceptible to hBD3 and LL37, and S. mutans was highly susceptible to hBD3. We measured the Zeta-potential, representing the net charge of whole bacteria, to study the relationship between susceptibility to cationic peptide and the net charge of the bacteria. Although we found some correlation in A. actinomycetemcomitans strains, we did not find a definite correlation with all the bacterial species. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that beta-defensins and LL37 have versatile antibacterial activity against oral bacteria.
TI  - Identification of non-mutans streptococci organisms in dental plaques recovering  on mitis-salivarius bacitracin agar medium.
AB  - The objective of this study was to both isolate and identify non-mutans streptococci organisms (non-MSO) from dental plaques recovered on mitis-salivarius sucrose bacitracin agar (MSB) plates. The dental plaque samples, which had been collected from 63 human subjects, were diluted and plated on MSB. The bacteria growing on the MSB plates were then identified with biochemical tests, as well as with 16S rDNA cloning and sequencing techniques. Our data indicated that bacteria from 30 subjects had been recovered on the MSB plates. Among the 21 typical colonies selected from the 30 subjects, 12 colonies, derived from 10 subjects, were identified as non-MSO. These 12 colonies were determined to be Streptococcus anginosus (8 colonies), S. sanguinis (1 colony), and Pantoea agglomerans (3 colonies). These results strongly suggest that a new selective medium will be required for the reliable isolation of mutans streptococci.
TI  - LuxS-based signaling affects Streptococcus mutans biofilm formation.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans is implicated as a major etiological agent in human dental caries, and one of the important virulence properties of this organism is its ability to form biofilms (dental plaque) on tooth surfaces. We examined the role of autoinducer-2 (AI-2) on S. mutans biofilm formation by constructing a GS-5 luxS-null mutant. Biofilm formation by the luxS mutant in 0.5% sucrose defined medium was found to be markedly attenuated compared to the wild type. Scanning electron microscopy also revealed that biofilms of the luxS mutant formed larger clumps in sucrose medium compared to the parental strain. Therefore, the expression of glucosyltransferase genes was examined and the gtfB and gtfC genes, but not the gtfD gene, in the luxS mutant were upregulated in the mid-log growth phase. Furthermore, we developed a novel two-compartment system to monitor AI-2 production by oral streptococci and periodontopathic bacteria. The biofilm defect of the luxS mutant was complemented by strains of S. gordonii, S. sobrinus, and S. anginosus; however, it was not complemented by S. oralis, S. salivarius, or S. sanguinis. Biofilm formation by the luxS mutant was also complemented by Porphyromonas gingivalis 381 and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Y4 but not by a P. gingivalis luxS mutant. These results suggest that the regulation of the glucosyltransferase genes required for sucrose-dependent biofilm formation is regulated by AI-2. Furthermore, these results provide further confirmation of previous proposals that quorum sensing via AI-2 may play a significant role in oral biofilm formation.
TI  - Identification of clinically relevant viridans streptococci by an oligonucleotide array.
AB  - Viridans streptococci (VS) are common etiologic agents of subacute infective endocarditis and are capable of causing a variety of pyogenic infections. Many species of VS are difficult to differentiate by phenotypic traits. An oligonucleotide array based on 16S-23S rRNA gene intergenic spacer (ITS) sequences was developed to identify 11 clinically relevant VS. These 11 species were Streptococcus anginosus, S. constellatus, S. gordonii, S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. parasanguinis, S. salivarius, S. sanguinis, and S. uberis. The method consisted of PCR amplification of the ITS regions by using a pair of universal primers, followed by hybridization of the digoxigenin-labeled PCR products to a panel of species-specific oligonucleotides immobilized on a nylon membrane. After 120 strains of the 11 species of VG and 91 strains of other bacteria were tested, the sensitivity and specificity of the oligonucleotide array were found to be 100% (120 of 120 strains) and 95.6% (87 of 91 strains), respectively. S. pneumoniae cross-hybridized to the probes used for the identification of S. mitis, and simple biochemical tests such as optochin susceptibility or bile solubility should be used to differentiate S. pneumoniae from S. mitis. In conclusion, identification of species of VS by use of the present oligonucleotide array is accurate and could be used as an alternative reliable method for species identification of strains of VS.
TI  - [The effect of galla chinensis on the growth of cariogenic bacteria in vitro].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purples of this study was to investigate the role of different components of Galla Chinensis extract on the growth of 6 kinds of cariogenic bacteria, and to find out the most effective components of Galla Chinensis extract. METHODS: Four different components (GCE1, GCE2, GCE3 and GCE4) were separated from Galla Chinensis and there antibacterial activities to Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556, Streptococcus salivarius SS 196, Actinomyces naeslundii WVU 627, Actinomyces viscosus ATCC 19246 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus AC 413 were checked. There effects on the growth curve of Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175 were also investigated. RESULTS: The most effective part of Galla Chinensis was found to be GCE2 and GCE4, which were found to be a mixture of polyphenol-rich fractions. All of the different components had an inhibitory effect to the growth of Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175. CONCLUSION: All of the 4 different components of Galla Chinensis extract could inhibit the growth of the tested bacteria. These results suggest that the antibacterial activity of Galla Chinensis extract is caused by a synergistic effect of monomeric polyphenols, which can easily bind to proteins.
TI  - Measurement of bacterial concentration fractions in polymicrobial mixtures by Raman microspectroscopy.
AB  - Relative concentrations of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis are important parameters in the study of dental caries, but current methods of measuring these concentrations are time consuming and prone to inaccuracies. We investigate the use of Raman spectroscopy for measuring relative concentrations of these two bacterial species in solid mixtures. To our knowledge, this is the first time Raman spectroscopy has been used to analyze bacterial mixtures rather than to identify the species of a pure colony. Mixtures of the two streptococcal species in various ratios are measured for 200 s using a home-built Raman microscope. Spectral correlations with bacterial content were identified via partial least-squares analysis. The relative concentrations of S. mutans in subsequent samples are predicted with a root mean squared error below 5%. In clinical plaque samples, this sort of accuracy would enable discrimination between normal and dangerously elevated levels of S. mutans. Samples with and without salivary proteins are predicted with equal accuracy. This result shows the potential of Raman spectroscopy for analyzing mixed populations of bacteria, such as those that occur in oral plaques.
TI  - Synergistic effects of streptococcal glucosyltransferases on adhesive biofilm formation.
AB  - Glucosyltransferases (GTF)-I and GTF-SI of Streptococcus mutans synthesize water-insoluble and both water-soluble and -insoluble glucans, respectively, and play essential roles in the sucrose-dependent adhesion of the organism to tooth surfaces. To examine the interactions of different GTFs on artificial biofilm formed by S. mutans and other oral streptococci, we generated GTF-I- and GTF-SI-hyperproducing isogenic mutant strains. Transformant B42-21, which hyperexpressed GTF-SI, exhibited firm adhesion in the presence of sucrose, whereas transformant B42-10, which hyperexpressed GTF-I, failed to exhibit firm adhesion. Furthermore, co-culture of transformant B42-21 with water-soluble glucan-synthesizing Streptococcus sanguinis yielded firm adhesion, while the addition of dextran T10 to B42-21 growing culture had no effect on adhesion. These findings suggest that GTF-SI has a strong effect on sucrose-dependent adhesion and is essential for biofilm formation on smooth surfaces, in cooperation with water-soluble glucans synthesized de novo by oral streptococci that inherently lack cell adhesion ability.
TI  - The antimicrobial potential of 14 natural herbal dentifrices: results of an in vitro diffusion method study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasing numbers of Americans are using natural herbal products for general and oral health care. Few of these products, however, have undergone rigorous testing, as evidenced by the limited amount of information on their safety and efficacy in the literature. The authors conducted an in vitro study to evaluate the antimicrobial potential of 14 natural herbal dentifrices. METHODS: The authors used a diffusion method to evaluate the antimicrobial effectiveness of 14 natural herbal dentifrices against four microorganisms: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus and Candida albicans. Colgate Total (Colgate-Palmolive, New York City) and sterile pyrogen-free water served as the positive and negative controls, respectively. The authors tested the natural herbal dentifrices at full strength and at 1:1 dilution. They measured the zones of inhibition at 24 and 48 hours to evaluate the antimicrobial potential of the dentifrices. RESULTS: Six herbal dentifrices were effective in inhibiting the growth of all four microorganisms. The positive control produced significantly sized inhibition zones with all four microorganisms, while the negative control produced no observable zones. Six herbal dentifrices produced larger inhibition zones with A. viscosus than did the positive control. Six herbal dentifrices were inhibitory against C. albicans at full strength, but at 1:1 dilution, only three had such inhibitory effect. One herbal dentifrice produced microbial growth around and over the samples, indicating possible microbial contamination of the toothpaste. Only one herbal dentifrice showed consistent antimicrobial activity against all four microorganisms. CONCLUSIONS: The variation in antimicrobial inhibition among the herbal dentifrices indicates that more research is needed to validate their effectiveness claims. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: This study provides practitioners with insight into the claims of natural herbal dentifrices' antimicrobial effects.
TI  - Adherent bacteria cells in five dental materials: sonication effect.
AB  - Adherent bacterial cells on the surfaces of two dental porcelain ceramics, three  composite resins and human enamel were examined using four types of bacteria strains. Their adherent cells were counted on saliva-coated and uncoated material surfaces after sonication, and contact angle and zeta potential were measured for each adherent cell tested. A correlation between contact angle and bacterial cells on an uncoated surface was found to be higher in two Streptococcus sanguis cells than in S. mutans Ingbritt and S. sobrinus OMZ 176, whereas there appeared to be a higher correlation between S. mutans Ingbritt or S. sobrinus OMZ 176 and zeta potential on the uncoated surface. On the saliva-coated surface, a significantly high correlation was found between the adherent cells, with the exception of S. sanguis ATCC 10 557, and the zeta potential. Contact angle and zeta potential values were small when the surfaces of the materials were coated with saliva, as compared with those on the uncoated surface. The sonication condition (120 s) of adherent cells on the surface of the material significantly depended on the types of bacteria cells, showing that S. mutans Ingbritt (>50-60%) had a greater removal percentage than the others (<50%).
TI  - Effect of hydrophobicity on in vitro streptococcal adhesion to dental alloys.
AB  - Non-specific interactions such as electrostatic interactions, and surface free energy are of importance in bacterial adhesion to dental surfaces as they determine whether or not bacteria are attracted to the surface. The relationship between adherence of Streptococcus mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis and S. sanguinis on precious and non-precious dental alloys, and the bacterial and alloy surface hydrophobicities (a measure of the surface free energy) was studied. The number of adhering bacteria was determined by fluorescence microscopy counts. The hydrophobicity of the bacteria and alloy surfaces were evaluated by adhesion to hexadecane and water contact angles, respectively. Our results showed that (i) the surfaces of the tested alloys were hydrophobic, (ii) S. sanguinis, S. mutans and S. oralis were hydrophobic, and (iii) S. mitis was hydrophilic. S. oralis, the more hydrophobic strain, demonstrated the highest adherence on the tested materials, whereas S. mitis adhered least on the hydrophobic surfaces. For the tested alloys, bacterial adherence was highest for the high gold content alloy, and lowest for the non-precious alloy. Our results showed that for the tested bacterial strains, there was a significant correlation between bacterial adhesion and substratum hydrophobicity: hydrophobic metal surfaces favor adhesion of hydrophobic bacteria.

TI  - Bactericidal effects of a fusion protein of llama heavy-chain antibodies coupled  to glucose oxidase on oral bacteria.
AB  - Enzymes such as lactoperoxidase and glucose oxidase (GOx) are used as antimicrobial agents in oral care products. Their low specificities and substantiveness can be reduced by covalent coupling of antimicrobial molecules to antibodies. Variable domains (V(HH)) derived from llama heavy-chain antibodies are particularly suited for such an approach. The antibodies are composed solely of heavy-chain dimers; therefore, production of active fusion proteins by using molecular biology-based techniques is less complicated than production by use of conventional antibodies. In this study, a fusion protein consisting of V(HH) and GOx was constructed and expressed by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A llama was immunized with Streptococcus mutans strain HG982. Subsequently, B lymphocytes were isolated and cDNA fragments encoding the V(HH) fragments were obtained by reverse transcription-PCR. After construction of a V(HH) library in Escherichia coli and screening of the library against mutans group streptococci and Streptococcus sanguinis strains, we found two V(HH) fragments with high specificities for S. mutans strains. A GOx gene was linked to the two V(HH) genes and cloned into S. cerevisiae yeasts. The yeasts expressed and secreted the recombinant proteins into the growth medium. The test of binding of fusion proteins to oral bacteria through their V(HH) fragments showed that S. mutans had been specifically targeted by GOx-S120, one of the fusion protein constructs. A low concentration of the fusion protein was also able to selectively kill S. mutans within 20 min in the presence of lactoperoxidase and potassium iodide. These findings demonstrate that the fusion protein GOx-V(HH) is potentially valuable in the selective killing of target bacteria such as S. mutans.
TI  - A simple approach to examine early oral microbial biofilm formation and the effects of treatments.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: A simple in vivo approach to examine early dental plaque formation in the human mouth and to determine the effects of common dietary and oral hygiene procedures on biofilm formation is reported. METHODS: A custom designed device that fits securely behind the teeth of the mandibular arch provides a surface for microbial colonization. This device is prepared with denture acrylic and can be repeatedly used by the subject, exposing a large and constant surface area for microbial accumulation. RESULTS: Large numbers of oral bacteria colonized the device by 2 h; these increased significantly by 4 h (P < 0.05). Bacterial colonization increased significantly after rinsing with a sucrose solution (P < 0.05) but remained unaffected after rinsing with water, a commercially available fluoride mouthrinse without antimicrobial agents, or brushing with a fluoride dentifrice (P > 0.05). Rinsing with mouthrinses formulated with chlorhexidine, cetylpyridinium chloride or triclosan/copolymer significantly inhibited colonization (P < 0.05). A dose-dependent inhibition was noted with chlorhexidine rinses (P < 0.05). Brushing with a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice significantly inhibited microbial colonization compared with a control (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This simple approach was useful for examining the effects of common dietary and oral hygiene procedures. Significant biofilm inhibitory effects were noted with formulations that demonstrated efficacy in previous clinical studies.
TI  - Effects of mouthrinses with triclosan, zinc ions, copolymer, and sodium lauryl sulphate combined with fluoride on acid formation by dental plaque in vivo.
AB  - Bacteriological tests demonstrated a slight synergistic effect of triclosan and sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) on the growth of Streptococcus mutans NCTC 10449 and Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556 in vitro. A single mouthrinse with SLS (17.4 mM) or SLS plus triclosan (3.5 mM) significantly decreased the number of salivary mutans streptococci in a group of 12 subjects up to 90 min after rinsing. The effect on plaque pH of a mouthrinse with either 12.0 mM NaF, NaF plus 10.0 mM zinc acetate, NaF plus 17.4 mM SLS, or NaF plus SLS plus 3.5 mM triclosan with or without the addition of zinc ions or 0.65% w/v of a polyvinylmethyl ether/maleic acid copolymer was investigated. The plaque pH responses to a 10% w/v sucrose mouthrinse were measured in 2-day-old plaque with microtouch pH electrodes in six groups of 10 subjects 90 min after a single mouthrinse with test solution. There was no significant difference in plaque pH between the various mouthrinses. In conclusion, triclosan enhanced the growth-inhibitory activity of SLS against oral streptococci in vitro but not against salivary mutans streptococci in vivo. Neither triclosan incorporated into a mouthrinse containing SLS plus fluoride, nor the addition of zinc ions or copolymer affected acid formation by dental plaque in vivo.
TI  - Zymographic characterization of bacteriolytic enzymes produced by oral streptococci.
AB  - Zymographic analysis was performed to know the bacteriolytic enzyme profiles of 4% SDS extracts of oral streptococci, Streptococcus mutans, S. sobrinus, S. sanguis, S. mitis and S. salivarius. We investigated the five strains in each species and found that the profile was very similar among strains of the same species except for S. salivarius(the profile was classified into two types). On the other hand, the profile was considerably different among species. Two major bacteriolytic enzymes of S. mutans showing molecular mass of 80 and 100 kDa were found using SDS-boiled S. mutans or S. sobrinus cells as substrate. These bacteriolytic activities were less apparent in the gel containing S. mitis or S. salivarius, and also not detectable in the gel containing S. sanguis. S. sobrinus extract showed only one bacteriolytic band (78 kDa) as strong activity using S. sobrinus cells as substrate. S. sanguis extract showed no bacteriolytic bands using any streptococcal cells. Extracts of either S. mitis or S. salivarius showed weak activity by using respective strains as substrate.
TI  - [Analysis of oral microflora early colonized in infants].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the dynamic changes of oral microflora early colonized in infants. METHODS: The oral swab samples for the study were taken in 1 day, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 months after birth from 12 healthy neonates. By choosing suitable diluted concentration, the samples were incubated aerobically, facultative anaerobically and anaerobically. The strains were identified by observing colony characteristics, Gram staining and biochemical tests. RESULTS: S. salivarius was the most frequent microflora, followed by S. mitis, S. sanguis, S. gordonii and S. mutans occurred in oral cavity after tooth eruption. Veillonella spp. can be detected in oral cavity of 1-month-old babies, A. odontolyticus was isolated from 8.3% infants of more than 3 months old. L. acidophilus maintained the lower prevalence in oral cavity of babies. Leptotrichia buccalis and Capnocytophaga spp. occurred in oral cavity of some dentate infants. CONCLUSION: S. solivarius and S. mitis are predominant species in oral cavity of the infants, Veillonella spp. is the first and the most anaerobic species appeared in oral cavity of healthy babies. A. odontolyticus is the first actinomyces detected in oral cavity. With the increasing months, kind and amount of microflora increase dramatically.
TI  - A novel glucan-binding protein with lipase activity from the oral pathogen Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans produces extracellular glucosyltransferases (GTFs) that synthesize glucans from sucrose. These glucans are important in determining the permeability properties and adhesiveness of dental plaque. GTFs and the GbpA glucan-binding protein are characterized by a binding domain containing a series of 33-amino-acid repeats, called 'A' repeats. The S. mutans genome sequence was searched for ORFs containing 'A' repeats, and one novel gene, gbpD, which appears to be unique to the mutans group of streptococci, was identified. The GbpD sequence revealed the presence of three 'A' repeats, in the middle of the protein, and a novel glucan-binding assay showed that GbpD binds to dextran with a K(D) of 2-3 nM. Construction of truncated derivatives of GbpD confirmed that the 'A' repeat region was essential for binding. Furthermore, a gbpD knockout mutant was modified in the extent of aggregation induced by polymers derived from sucrose. The N-terminus of GbpD has a signal sequence, followed by a region with no homologues in the public databases, while the C-terminus has homology to the alpha/beta hydrolase family (including lipases and carboxylesterases). GbpD contains the two regions typical of these enzymes: a GxSxG active site 'lipase box' and an 'oxyanion hole'. GbpD released free fatty acids (FFAs) from a range of triglycerides in the presence of calcium, indicating a lipase activity. The glucan binding/lipase bifunctionality suggested the natural substrate for the enzyme may be a surface macromolecule consisting of carbohydrate linked to lipid. The gbpD mutant was less hydrophobic than wild-type and pure recombinant GbpD reduced the hydrophobicity of S. mutans and another plaque bacterium, Streptococcus sanguinis. GbpD bound to and released FFA from lipoteichoic acid (LTA) of S. sanguinis, but had no effect on LTA from S. mutans. These results raise the intriguing possibility that GbpD may be involved in direct interspecies competition within the plaque biofilm.
TI  - Identification of clinically relevant viridans group streptococci by sequence analysis of the 16S-23S ribosomal DNA spacer region.
AB  - The feasibility of sequence analysis of the 16S-23S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) intergenic spacer (ITS) for the identification of clinically relevant viridans group streptococci (VS) was evaluated. The ITS regions of 29 reference strains (11 species) of VS were amplified by PCR and sequenced. These 11 species were Streptococcus anginosus, S. constellatus, S. gordonii, S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. parasanguinis, S. salivarius, S. sanguinis, and S. uberis. The ITS lengths (246 to 391 bp) and sequences were highly conserved among strains within a species. The intraspecies similarity scores for the ITS sequences ranged from 0.98 to 1.0, except for the score for S. gordonii strains. The interspecies similarity scores for the ITS sequences varied from 0.31 to 0.93. Phylogenetic analysis of the ITS regions revealed that evolution of the regions of some species of VS is not parallel to that of the 16S rRNA genes. One hundred six clinical isolates of VS were identified by the Rapid ID 32 STREP system (bioMerieux Vitek, Marcy l'Etoile, France) and by ITS sequencing, and the level of disagreement between the two methods was 18% (19 isolates). Most isolates producing discrepant results could be unambiguously assigned to a specific species by their ITS sequences. The accuracy of using ITS sequencing for identification of VS was verified by 16S rDNA sequencing for all strains except strains of S. oralis and S. mitis, which were difficult to differentiate by their 16S rDNA sequences. In conclusion, identification of species of VS by ITS sequencing is reliable and could be used as an alternative accurate method for identification of VS.
TI  - The bacteriology of the supragingival plaque of child dental patients in Kuwait.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the bacterial flora of the gingival plaques of pediatric dental patients in order to establish baseline data for future studies on the complex microbiota of the oral cavity of this group of child dental patients. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Forty subjects, aged 3-12 years, were enrolled and investigated after informed consent was obtained. During the patients' first visit to the dental clinic supragingival plaque samples were collected from the gingival area of buccal and lingual tooth surfaces of all primary and permanent molar teeth using sterile curettes. Serially diluted samples were inoculated onto a set of selective and nonselective media and then incubated at the appropriate atmospheric conditions and temperatures. Representative colonies of isolates were identified by standard methods, including hemolytic characteristics on blood agar and profiling on API 20S and API 20A as appropriate. RESULTS: A total of 183 isolates (123 aerobes and 60 anaerobes) were recovered from the 40 patients with a mean count of 3 per sample of aerobes compared to 1.5 per sample for the anaerobes. Streptococcus sanguis was the predominant aerobic species (23.6%) isolated from 29 (72.5%) of the 40 patients, followed by Streptococcus mitis, 19.5 and 60%, Streptococcus salivarius, 17.1 and 52.5% and Streptococcus mutans, 17.1 and 52.5%. The frequency of isolation of anaerobic bacteria was Prevotella spp. 50% from 30 (75%) of the 40 patients, Fusobacterium spp., 18.3 and 27.5%, Bacteroides spp., Porphyromonas spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp., 6.7 and 10%, 6.7 and 10%, and 5 and 7.5%, respectively. Prevotella intermedia was the single most common species. CONCLUSION: The results show that there were more aerobic/facultative anaerobic bacteria than the obligate anaerobes in the dental plaque of the pediatric dental patients in Kuwait. The high prevalence of the pioneering streptococci as well as black-pigmented Prevotella spp. and Fusobacterium spp. indicates that the dental plaques of the children were in the developing stage, a precursor to the development of periodontal diseases.
TI  - Selection for high-level resistance by chronic triclosan exposure is not universal.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of triclosan exposure on the antimicrobial  susceptibilities of numerically important dental bacteria. METHODS: A gradient plate technique was used to expose Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Neisseria subflava, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Prevotella nigrescens, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans and Veillonella dispar repeatedly to escalating, sublethal concentrations of triclosan. Escherichia coli ATCC 8739 was included as an organism showing the triclosan resistance development trait. MIC values towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were determined before and after biocide exposure. RESULTS: N. subflava, Pr. nigrescens Po. gingivalis and E. coli were highly susceptible to triclosan (MIC range 0.1-3.9 mg/L), whereas the lactobacillus and S. mutans were less susceptible (MIC range 15.6-20.8 mg/L). Triclosan exposure resulted in a highly significant ( approximately 400-fold) reduction in triclosan susceptibility (P < 0.01) for the positive control E. coli, although its MICs towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were not significantly altered. Minor ( approximately two-fold) decreases in triclosan susceptibility (MIC) occurred for Pr. nigrescens and in S. sanguis and S. oralis (MBC). Mean changes in susceptibilities (MIC and MBC) of the oral species to chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline did not exceed two-fold, although chlorhexidine MBCs for S. sanguis were markedly, but transiently, increased. CONCLUSIONS: These data fail to demonstrate biologically significant drug resistance in triclosan-exposed bacteria and suggest that markedly decreased triclosan susceptibility, although confirmed for E. coli, is not a universal phenomenon. Other bacteria possibly possess more susceptible targets than FabI that are highly conserved, which may govern triclosan activity.
TI  - Preliminary evaluation of bioactive glass S53P4 as an endodontic medication in vitro.
AB  - Calcium hydroxide is the "gold standard" endodontic medication, but it may fail to eliminate certain facultative bacteria and yeasts found in root canal systems. In this study, standardized bovine dentin blocks infected with Enterococcus faecalis were treated with an aqueous calcium hydroxide or bioactive glass S53P4 (BAG) powder suspension. While calcium hydroxide was ineffective, the BAG suspension eliminated the infection in the sampled dentin layers after 5 days. In a direct exposure test, preincubation with human dentin boosted the BAG-killing efficacy against E. faecalis ATCC29212, Candida albicans CCUG19915, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC9027, Streptococcus sanguis ATCC10556, and S. mutans ATCC25175. BAG placed in the root canals of extracted teeth did not alter root-dentin pH. Consequently, the conditions under which the microbiota were killed were not pH-mediated. Further studies are ongoing to help clarify the antimicrobial BAG effect in the presence of dentin.
TI  - Isopanduratin A from Kaempferia pandurata as an active antibacterial agent against cariogenic Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - An antibacterial compound active against Streptococcus mutans was isolated from Kaempferia pandurata and identified as isopanduratin A using 1H NMR, 13C NMR and EI-MS. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of isopanduratin A was 4 mg/l which was much lower than that of some other natural anticariogenic agents such as sanguinarine (12 mg/l), green tea extract and carvacrol (125 mg/l), thymol (250 mg/l) and isoeugenol and eucalyptol (500 mg/l). The bactericidal test showed that isopanduratin A completely inactivated S. mutans at 20 mg/l in 1 min. Significant inhibitory activity of isopanduratin A was also observed against S. sobrinus, S. sanguinis and S. salivarius with an MIC of 4 mg/l. Damage to the cell membrane and cell wall of S. mutans by isopanduratin A was shown using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). These results suggest that isopanduratin A could be employed as a potential antibacterial agent for preventing dental caries.
TI  - Lactoferrampin: a novel antimicrobial peptide in the N1-domain of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of bovine lactoferrin is attributed to lactoferricin,  situated in the N1-domain. Based on common features of antimicrobial peptides, a second putative antimicrobial domain was identified in the N1-domain of lactoferrin, designated lactoferrampin. This novel peptide exhibited candidacidal activity, which was substantially higher than the activity of lactoferrin. Furthermore, lactoferrampin was active against Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but not against the fermenting bacteria Actinomyces naeslundii, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis. Notably, lactoferrampin is located in the N1-domain in close proximity to lactoferricin, which plays a crucial role in membrane-mediated activities of lactoferrin.
TI  - [Dynamic observation of periodontal pathogens and cariogenic bacteria in modified chemostat using confocal laser scanning microscopy].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study dynamic relation between periodontal pathogens and cariogenic bacteria under analogous oral environment. METHODS: Eight periodontopathic and cariogenic bacteria of Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), Provotella intermedium (Pi), Streptococcus mutans (Sm), Streptococcus sanguis (Ss), Actinomyces viscosus (Av) and Lactobacillus acidophilus (La) were used. These eight strains were cultured in modified chemostat under analogous oral environment which contained 600 ml modified BM medium supplemented with 2.5 g/L porcine gastric mucin, respectively. After 1, 24, 48 and 96 h, optical sectioning of plaque biofilms on removable and replaceable hydroxyapatite disks was analyzed by the combination of live bacterial Gram fluorescence staining and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Biofilm thickness and reconstruction of the three-dimensional architecture of plaque biofilms were made. RESULTS: Biofilm thickness increased significantly with time (P < 0.001). Biofilms of Aa were thinner than those of Ss and eight-specie biofilms were thicker than those formed by Ss and Aa per time point. Three-dimensional images showed periodontal pathogens mainly occurred in cariogenic bacterial complex or on the biofilm surface. CONCLUSIONS: Gram-positive cariogenic species initially predominated in artificial plaque, followed by the increasing proportions of Gram-negative periodontal pathogens. The relation between microecological balance among bacteria and diseases is worthy of further studies.
TI  - Modifications of hydrophobicity, in vitro adherence and cellular aggregation of Streptococcus mutans by Helichrysum italicum extract.
AB  - AIMS: The purpose of the present study was to examine whether sublethal concentrations of Helichrysum italicum extract could affect some of the cariogenic properties of Streptococcus mutans. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied the antibacterial activity of H. italicum (ethanolic extract) against oral streptococci (Strep. mutans ATCC 35668, Strep. salivarius ATCC 13419 and Strep. sanguis ATCC 10556) and its influence on cell-surface hydrophobicity, in vitro sucrose-dependent adherence to glass surface and cellular aggregation of Strep. mutans. The results indicate that all streptococci were susceptible to ethanolic extract with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 31.25-62.50 microg x ml(-1). Sub-MIC concentrations of H. italicum (7.81-31.25 microg x ml(-1)) reduced the hydrophobicity and the adherence (almost 90%) to glass surface of Strep. mutans. The aggregation in the presence of dextran T2000 was also affected. CONCLUSION: The inhibitory activity of H. italicum extract on Strep. mutans is worthy of further study. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: There is considerable interest in the use of natural compounds as alternative methods to control undesirable micro-organisms.
TI  - PCR detection and identification of oral streptococci in saliva samples using gtf genes.
AB  - Oral streptococci are major constituents of dental plaque, and their prevalence is implicated in various pathologies. Therefore, accurate identification of oral streptococci would be valuable for studies of cariogenic plaque and for diagnostic use in infective endocarditis. Many oral streptococci possess glucosyltransferase enzymes that synthesize glucan, which is an obligate component of dental plaque. We established a rapid and precise method to identify oral streptococci by PCR using the species-specific region from the glucosyltransferase gene. With the species-specific primers, Streptococcus mutans, S. sobrinus, S. salivarius, S. sanguinis, S. oralis, and S. gordonii could be successfully distinguished. Further, we developed a simple method to extract the bacterial DNA from saliva. Using the resultant DNA as a template, the proposed PCR detection was performed. Their distribution was in accord with results of conventional biochemical tests. These findings indicate that the present PCR method is useful for the analysis of oral streptococci and can be successfully used in clinical applications to identify pathogenic bacteria associated with oral infectious disease and/or endocarditis.
TI  - Human beta-defensins 2 and 3 demonstrate strain-selective activity against oral microorganisms.
AB  - Human beta-defensins 2 and 3 (HBD-2 and HBD-3) are inducible peptides present at  sites of infection in the oral cavity. A few studies have reported broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity for both peptides. However, no comprehensive study has thoroughly investigated their potential against oral pathogens. The purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of HBD-2 and HBD-3 against a collection of oral organisms (Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Peptostreptococcus micros, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces israelii, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei, Candida glabrata, and Candida albicans). Radial diffusion assays were used to test HBD-2 and HBD-3 activities against at least three strains of each species. There was significant variability in MICs, which was strain specific rather than species specific. MICs ranged from 3.9 to >250 micro g/ml for HBD-2 and from 1.4 to >250 micro g/ml for HBD-3. HBD-3 demonstrated greater antimicrobial activity and was effective against a broader array of organisms. Overall, aerobes were 100% susceptible to HBD-2 and HBD-3, whereas only 21.4 and 50% of the anaerobes were susceptible to HBD-2 and HBD-3, respectively. HBD-2 and HBD-3 also demonstrated strain-specific activity against the Candida species evaluated. Interestingly, an association between HBD-2 and HBD-3 activities was noted. This suggests that the two peptides may have similar mechanisms yet utilize distinct pathways. The lack of activity against specific anaerobic strains and Candida warrants further investigation of the potential resistance mechanisms of these organisms. Finally, the significant variability between strains underlies the importance of testing multiple strains when evaluating activities of antimicrobial peptides.
TI  - [The in vitro study on Polistes mandarinus' effects on cariogenic bacteria].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the role of Polistes mandarinus on the growth,acid generation and water insoluble glucan(WIG) production of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis and Actinomyces viscosus as a preparation for screening an effective agent ot medicate the balance of oral microflora. METHODS: Streptococcus mutans 3a3, Streptococcus sanguis SB 179 and Actinomyces viscosus ATCC 19246 were chosen as the experimental bacteria. The effects of Polistes mandarinus on the growth, acid generation and glucan production were observed. RESULTS: Polistes mandarinus can inhibit the growth and acid generation of S.mutans,S.sanguis and A.viscosus, and the water-insoluble glucan production of S.mutants and S.sanguis effectively. CONCLUSION: Polistes mandarinus can inhibit the growth, acid generation and glucan production of oral bacteria effectively.
TI  - [Evaluation of in vitro cario-static effect of Galla chinensis with biofilm model].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the in vitro cario-static effect of Galla chinesis with biofilm model. METHODS: A four-organism bacterial consortium was cultured in a biofilm model on hydroxyapatite (HA) discs in a continuous culture system and exposed to repeated solution pulsing. There were three groups with different solution pulsed in the model: negative control group was pulsed with distilled water, positive control group was pulsed with 100 mmol/L sucrose solution and experimental group was pulsed with 100 mmol/L sucrose solution containing 4.0 g/L Galla chinensis. During the experiment, the dynamic changes of pH were recorded. After 6 pulses, surface structure of the biofilm was observed with a scanning electron microscope and the population on the biofilm was enumerated. RESULTS: Galla chinesis significantly inhibited the adherence of Actinomyces naelundii to HA disc compared with the control group and facilitated the removal of acid products. It was also found that the extra-cellular polysaccharide was reduced with the pulsing of Galla chinesis. CONCLUSION: Galla chinesis in the biofilm model can partially reduce the cario-genic response of sucrose solution.
TI  - In vitro cariogenic potential of Candida albicans.
AB  - The adherence and dissociation of Candida albicans, C. tropicalis, Streptococcus  mutans and S. sanguis to six substrates including hydroxylapatite (HAP) which exhibit various hydrophobicity, was examined by the use of a bioluminescent adenosine triphosphate (ATP) assay. Dissolution of HAP by C. albicans or S. mutans was determined spectrophotometrically by the use of o-cresolphthalein complexone. In the adherence of C. tropicalis, S. mutans and S. sanguis, the amount of adherent cells correlated with the hydrophobicity of the substrates. In contrast, the adherence of C. albicans to HAP was extraordinary high, although the adherence of the fungi also correlated with the hydrophobicity of the substrates, except for HAP. The yeasts attached to HAP was effectively removed by high concentration of either phosphate or calcium ions. The amount of calcium-release from HAP caused by C. albicans and S. mutans was 113 microg ml(-1) (final pH = 3.45), and 5.4 microg ml(-1) (final pH 4.81), respectively and the maximum growth of C. albicans and S. mutans was 10(7) cfu ml(-1) and 7.4 x 10(12) cfu ml(-1), respectively. The results, taken together, suggest that C. albicans adhere to HAP specifically through electrostatic interaction, and that, in a much smaller number (1.0/7.4 x 10(5)), C. albicans possesses the ability to dissolve HAP to a greater extent (approximately 20-fold) when compared with S. mutans.
TI  - Susceptibility of oral bacteria to Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) oil in vitro.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) oil against 161 isolates of oral bacteria from 15 genera was determined. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) ranged from 0.003 to 2.0% (v/v). MIC90 values were 1.0% (v/v) for Actinomyces spp., Lactobacillus spp., Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus sanguis, and 0.1% (v/v) for Prevotella spp. Isolates of Porphyromonas, Prevotella and Veillonella had the lowest MICs and MBCs, and isolates of Streptococcus, Fusobacterium and Lactobacillus had the highest. Time kill studies with Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus rhamnosus showed that treatment with > or = 0.5% tea tree oil caused decreases in viability of >3 log colony forming units/ml after only 30 s, and viable organisms were not detected after 5 min. These studies indicate that a range of oral bacteria are susceptible to tea tree oil, suggesting that tea tree oil may be of use in oral healthcare products and in the maintenance of oral hygiene.
TI  - A rapid procedure to ascertain the antimicrobial efficacy of oral care formulations.
AB  - A rapid method examining the antimicrobial efficacy of oral care formulations with alamar blue, an oxidation-reduction dye with fluorescent end-points, is described. Significant correlations between increasing viable plate counts of the oral bacteria Actinomyces viscosus, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and increased alamar fluorescence were noted. Metabolically active bacteria reduced alamar with the reduced dye found in the cell-free filtrate. Insignificant alamar reductions were noted in the absence of bacteria or by spent culture supernatants. The efficacy of mouthrinses with clinically proven antiplaque agents such as chlorhexidine or cetylpyridinium chloride were determined by alamar blue. In a model system with A. viscosus, triclosan dentifrices demonstrate a dose-dependent effect on bacteria. Human salivary bacteria demonstrate increasing alamar fluorescence with increasing plate counts. A clinical study examined the effects of rinsing with chlorhexidine or cetylpyridinium chloride mouthrinses in comparison with a placebo mouthrinse and water on salivary bacteria. Rinsing with chlorhexidine resulted in the least number of bacteria by alamar and plate count methods. In summary, the current study demonstrates the utility of alamar blue to examine the antimicrobial effects of oral care formulations in laboratory and clinical studies.
TI  - Proteome analysis of oral pathogens.
AB  - The oral environment contains diverse communities of micro-organisms including bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and viruses. Studies of oral ecology have led to an appreciation of the complexity of the interactions that oral micro-organisms have with the host in both health and disease. Despite this, diseases such as dental caries and periodontal diseases are still worldwide human ailments, resulting in a high level of morbidity and an economic burden to society. Proteomics offers a new approach to the understanding of holistic changes occurring as oral micro-organisms adapt to environmental change within their habitats in the mouth.
TI  - Synergistic inhibitory effect of cationic peptides and antimicrobial agents on the growth of oral streptococci.
AB  - Although chlorhexidine is one of the most efficacious antimicrobial agents used for the prevention of dental caries, side effects limit its application. The effects of gaegurin 6 (GGN6), an animal-derived cationic peptide, and its derivatives PTP6 and PTP12 on the growth of oral streptococci were investigated to assess the potential of these agents for use in the prevention of dental caries. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of the peptides for inhibition of the growth of oral streptococci (Streptococcus mutans , S. sobrinus, S. sanguis and S. gordonii) ranged from 1.2 to 8.2 muM. The peptides also exhibited marked synergistic antibacterial effects with chlorhexidine or xylitol. The most effective combinations (fractional inhibitory concentration index of 0.5) were xylitol with GGN6 against S. gordonii 10558 and chlorhexidine with either GGN6 or PTP6 against S. sobrinus OMZ-175. These results indicate that cationic peptides alone or in combination with chlorhexidine or xylitol might prove effective for the inhibition of the growth of cariogenic oral streptococci in situ.
TI  - The acid-tolerant microbiota associated with plaque from initial caries and healthy tooth surfaces.
AB  - The intent of this study was to compare the inherent acid tolerance of bacteria in samples of dental plaque from tooth sites in subjects with and without initial caries. Plaque was collected from approximal surfaces showing early enamel caries and from healthy tooth surfaces in the same subjects, as well as from enamel surfaces of caries-free individuals. In addition to plating on blood agar, the plaque samples were plated directly on non-selective solid agar medium buffered to pH 7.0, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0 to avoid any loss of adaptation to acid during primary isolation of plaque bacteria. The results showed that approximately 50% of the total cultivable plaque microbiota from caries, as well as healthy tooth sites, was able to grow at pH 5.5 and 1% at pH 5.0, pH values regarded as critical for the demineralization of tooth enamel. At pH 5.0, members of the genus Streptococcus were the dominant group, but mutans streptococci accounted for less than half of the streptococcal viable count. The other acid-tolerant streptococcal isolates included Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus gordinii, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus salivarius and SStreptococcus sanguis. Analysis of the results indicated that the mutans streptococci in dental plaque were highly variable with respect to acid tolerance, and that both caries and healthy sites harboured significant numbers of mutans streptococci that were not acid-tolerant.
TI  - [Evaluation of the cario-static effect of Nidus vespae on biofilm model in vitro].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the Nidus vespae's cario-static effect on biofilm model in vitro. METHODS: A four-organism bacterial consortium was grown in a biofilm model on hydroxyapatite (HA) discs in a continuous culture system and exposed to repeated solution pulsing respectively. There were three parallel-connected flow cells in the model, so were the three groups with different solution pulsed in. Negative control group was pulsed with distilled water, positive control group was pulsed with 250 mmol/L sucrose solution as well. While 4.0 g/L Nidus vespae together with 250 mmol/L sucrose solution was pulsed in the experiment group. During the experiment, the pH responses against the pulses were recorded. After the 6 pulses, the biofilm surface structure was observed with a scan electron microscope and the population on the biofilm was enumerated. RESULTS: Nidus vespae can significantly inhibit the adherence of Streptococcus mutans to HA discs compared with the control group of 250 mmol/L sucrose pulsed in, and can facilitate the remove of acid products. It is also found that the extra-cellular polysaccharide is reduced with the pulsing of Nidus vespae. CONCLUSION: Nidus vespae in the biofilm model can partially decrease the cariogenic response of sucrose solution pulsed in.
TI  - [Construction of plant expression plasmid of chimera SBR-CT delta A1].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to construct plant expression plasmid containing the gene encoding chimera SBR-CT delta A1. METHODS: The target gene fragment P2, including the gene-encoded chimera SBR-CT delta A1 (3,498-5,378 bp), was obtained by standard PCR amplification. The PCR products were ligated with pGEM-easy vector through TA clone to form plasmid pTSC. The plasmid pTSC and plasmid pPOKII were digested by restricted endonuclease BamHI and KpnI, and the digested products were extracted and purified for recombination. Then the purified P2 and plasmid pPOKII were recombined by T4 DNA ligase to form recombinant plasmid pROSC; inserting bar gene into the plasmid and form pROSB plasmid. The recombined plasmids were isolated and identified by restricted endonuclease cutting and Sanger dideoxy DNA sequencing. RESULTS: P2 gene was linked to pPOKII plasmid and formed recombinant plasmid pROSC. The DNA sequence and orientation were corrected. And bar gene was inserted into pPOSC and form recombinant plasmid pROSB. CONCLUSION: Plant expression vector pROSC and pROSB containing the gene encoding chimera SBR-CT delta A1, which may provide useful experiment foundation for further study on edible vaccine against caries have been successfully constructed.
TI  - Activity of human beta-defensin 3 alone or combined with other antimicrobial agents against oral bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activities of human beta-defensin 3 (hBD-3) alone or combined with lysozyme, metronidazole, amoxicillin, and chlorhexidine were investigated with the oral bacteria Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. hBD-3 showed bactericidal activity against all of the bacterial species tested. The bactericidal effect was enhanced when the peptide was used in combination with the antimicrobial agents mentioned above.
TI  - Real-time interaction of oral streptococci with human salivary components.
AB  - Oral streptococci are present in large numbers in dental plaque and several types interact with the enamel salivary pellicle to form a biofilm on tooth surfaces. The respective affinity of individual streptococci for salivary components has an influence on the etiologic properties of oral biofilm in the development of dental caries. We studied real-time biospecific interactions between oral streptococci and salivary components utilizing biosensor technology to analyze surface plasmon resonance. Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mutans showed significant responses for binding to salivary components, in comparison with other bacteria. Further, the association rates (4.1 x 10-11/bacterium) and dissociation rate (5.7 +/- 0.9 x 10-3 Second(s)-1) were higher for S. sanguis than for S. mutans (2.4 x 10-11 and 2.9 +/- 0.8 x 10-3) and Streptococcus mitis (1.3 x 10-11 and 3.5 +/- 1.3 x 10-3). However, the association equilibrium constants (8.2 S/bacterium) for S. mutans was 2 times higher in than S. mitis (3.8) and slightly higher than S. sanguis (7.2). These findings may provide useful information regarding the mechanism of early biofilm formation by streptococci on the tooth surface.
TI  - Non-mutans streptococci in patients receiving radiotherapy in the head and neck area.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study mutans and non-mutans streptococci in patients after radiotherapy of the head and neck. METHODS: Oral rinse samples collected from nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients before and after radiotherapy were diluted and cultured on nonselective and selective media for enumeration of total cultivable plaque flora, mutans and non-mutans streptococci and lactobacilli. Non-mutans streptococci were identified biochemically and by 16S rDNA sequence homology analysis. RESULTS: After irradiation, mutans streptococci were not isolated; the levels of Streptococcus mitis and lactobacilli increased significantly. The level of Streptococcus salivarius increased, but the significance was the borderline. The level of Streptococcus sanguis decreased significantly after irradiation. The abundance of other oral streptococci species showed no significant changes. CONCLUSIONS: S. mitis and S. salivarius are the predominant non-mutans streptococci in the high-caries-risk oral flora following radiotherapy.
TI  - Glucan-binding proteins of the oral streptococci.
AB  - The synthesis of extracellular glucan is an integral component of the sucrose-dependent colonization of tooth surfaces by species of the mutans streptococci. In investigators' attempts to understand the mechanisms of plaque biofilm development, several glucan-binding proteins (GBPs) have been discovered. Some of these, the glucosyltransferases, catalyze the synthesis of glucan, whereas others, designated only as glucan-binding proteins, have affinities for different forms of glucan and contribute to aspects of the biology of their host organisms. The functions of these latter glucan-binding proteins include dextran-dependent aggregation, dextranase inhibition, plaque cohesion, and perhaps cell wall synthesis. In some instances, their glucan-binding domains share common features, whereas in others the mechanism for glucan binding remains unknown. Recent studies indicate that at least some of the glucan-binding proteins modulate virulence and some can act as protective immunogens within animal models. Overall, the multiplicity of GBPs and their aforementioned properties are testimonies to their importance. Future studies will greatly advance the understanding of the distribution, function, and regulation of the GBPs and place into perspective the facets of their contributions to the biology of the oral streptococci.
TI  - Classification of oral streptococci by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis with direct activity stain for glycosyltransferases.
AB  - Thirty eight strains of oral streptococci were divided into six types by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) followed by glycosyltransferase (GLT) activity stain: Type 1, Streptococcus mutans; Type 2, Streptococcus rattus; Type 3, Streptococcus sobrinus and Streptococcus downei; Type 4, Streptococcus cricetus; Type 5, Streptococcus salivarius; and Type 6, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus oralis and Streptococcus gordonii. In Types 1, 2 and 5, two glucosyltransferases synthesizing water-insoluble (GTF-I) and water-soluble glucans (GTF-S) and a fructosyltransferase (FTF) were detected. In Types 3 and 4, GTF-I and two GTF-Ss were detected. Only one GTF-S was detected in Type 6. The 2-DE patterns for these six types were clearly distinguished from each other based on the kind, number and location of GLTs in gel.
TI  - PCR method is essential for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis in oral cavity samples.
AB  - Tuberculosis is a re-emerging infectious disease, and infection by Mycobacterium  tuberculosis has been increasing in immunocompromised hosts, including elderly persons. M. tuberculosis-infected persons may receive dental treatment. To evaluate the risk of M. tuberculosis infection in dental clinics, we examined the detection rates of M. tuberculosis in sample of mixed saliva, dental plaque, extracted teeth, caries lesions, and denture plaque by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The detection rates by PCR in samples from mixed saliva, dental plaque, caries lesions and denture plaque obtained from tuberculosis patients were 98.0%, 92.0%, 89.0%, and 100%, respectively. The detection rates by the culture method were 17.3%, 2.0%, 0%, and 0%, respectively. M. tuberculosis also was detected from the nontuberculous mycobacteria-infected group. Strains of Actinomyces naeslundii, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum inhibited the growth of clinical strains of M. tuberculosis, but strains of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans did not. The present study concludes that the PCR method is essential for detecting M. tuberculosis in oral samples.
TI  - Invasion and killing of human endothelial cells by viridans group streptococci.
AB  - Colonization of the cardiovascular endothelium by viridans group streptococci can result in infective endocarditis and possibly atherosclerosis; however, the mechanisms of pathogenesis are poorly understood. We investigated the ability of selected oral streptococci to infect monolayers of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in 50% human plasma and to produce cytotoxicity. Planktonic Streptococcus gordonii CH1 killed HUVEC over a 5-h period by peroxidogenesis (alpha-hemolysin) and by acidogenesis but not by production of protein exotoxins. HUVEC were protected fully by addition of supplemental buffers and bovine liver catalase to the culture medium. Streptococci were also found to invade HUVEC by an endocytic mechanism that was dependent on polymerization of actin microfilaments and on a functional cytoskeleton, as indicated by inhibition with cytochalasin D and nocodazole. Electron microscopy revealed streptococci attached to HUVEC surfaces via numerous fibrillar structures and bacteria in membrane-encased cytoplasmic vacuoles. Following invasion by S. gordonii CH1, HUVEC monolayers showed 63% cell lysis over 4 h, releasing 64% of the total intracellular bacteria into the culture medium; however, the bacteria did not multiply during this time. The ability to invade HUVEC was exhibited by selected strains of S. gordonii, S. sanguis, S. mutans, S. mitis, and S. oralis but only weakly by S. salivarius. Comparison of isogenic pairs of S. gordonii revealed a requirement for several surface proteins for maximum host cell invasion: glucosyltransferase, the sialic acid-binding protein Hsa, and the hydrophobicity/coaggregation proteins CshA and CshB. Deletion of genes for the antigen I/II adhesins, SspA and SspB, did not affect invasion. We hypothesize that peroxidogenesis and invasion of the cardiovascular endothelium by viridans group streptococci are integral events in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis and atherosclerosis.
TI  - Will triclosan in toothpaste select for resistant oral streptococci?
AB  - The aims of the study were to determine the in vitro sensitivity of triclosan against viridans streptococci and the impact of triclosan on the normal oral microflora. Nine subjects used a triclosan-containing toothpaste for 2 weeks. Saliva samples were collected on days 0 and 14 and were analyzed quantitatively. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of triclosan and of several antimicrobial agents were determined for the streptococci isolated on days 0 and 14. No major changes occurred in the normal oral microflora during the study period. There were no differences in susceptibility between streptococcal strains collected at days 0 and 14 against triclosan or antimicrobial agents. Short-term use of triclosan has no major impact on normal oral microflora or on streptococcal susceptibility of antimicrobial agents. The effects of long-term use should be evaluated.
TI  - Kuwanon G: an antibacterial agent from the root bark of Morus alba against oral pathogens.
AB  - Kuwanon G was isolated from the ethyl acetate fraction of methanol extract of Morus alba and its structure was elucidated by 13C-NMR, 1H-NMR and FAB-MS. Antibacterial activity of kuwanon G was investigated by the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) test and the viable cell count method. MIC of kuwanon G against Streptococcus mutans causing dental caries was determined to be 8.0 microg/ml. The bactericidal test showed that kuwanon G completely inactivated S. mutans at the concentration 20 microg/ml in 1 min. Kuwanon G also significantly inhibited the growth of other cariogenic bacteria such as Streptococcus sobrinus and Streptococcus sanguis, and Porpyromonas gingivalis causing periodontitis. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of kuwanon G treated cells demonstrated remarkable morphological damage of the cell wall and condensation of the cytoplasm.
TI  - In vitro testing of xylitol as an anticariogenic agent.
AB  - A number of studies involving xylitol chewing gum have demonstrated that xylitol  is both noncariogenic and anticariogenic. The ability of xylitol to act as an anticariogenic agent most likely is due to its ability to be transported into caries-causing oral bacteria and inhibiting fermentation either by depleting the cell of high-energy phosphate or by poisoning the glycolytic system. In vitro tests were conducted to determine the concentration of xylitol required to inhibit the growth of three strains of oral streptococcus (S. mutans, S. salivarius, and S. sanguis). All three strains were inhibited significantly at xylitol concentrations of 12.5% and higher; however, only S. mutans was inhibited significantly at a xylitol concentration of 1.56%.
TI  - Genetic and biochemical characterization of the F-ATPase operon from Streptococcus sanguis 10904.
AB  - Oral streptococci utilize an F-ATPase to regulate cytoplasmic pH. Previous studies have shown that this enzyme is a principal determinant of aciduricity in the oral streptococcal species Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mutans. Differences in the pH optima of the respective ATPases appears to be the main reason that S. mutans is more tolerant of low pH values than S. sanguis and hence pathogenic. We have recently reported the genetic arrangement for the S. mutans operon. For purposes of comparative structural biology we have also investigated the F-ATPase from S. sanguis. Here, we report the genetic characterization and expression in Escherichia coli of the S. sanguis ATPase operon. Sequence analysis showed a gene order of atpEBFHAGDC and that a large intergenic space existed upstream of the structural genes. Activity data demonstrate that ATPase activity is induced under acidic conditions in both S. sanguis and S. mutans; however, it is not induced to the same extent in the nonpathogenic S. sanguis. Expression studies with an atpD deletion strain of E. coli showed that S. sanguis-E. coli hybrid enzymes were able to degrade ATP but were not sufficiently functional to permit growth on succinate minimal media. Hybrid enzymes were found to be relatively insensitive to inhibition by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, indicating loss of productive coupling between the membrane and catalytic subunits.
TI  - Influence of short-term sucrose exposure on plaque acidogenicity and cariogenic microflora in individuals with different levels of mutans streptococci.
AB  - The aim was to study the short-term effect of a varying sucrose exposure on plaque acidogenicity and cariogenic microflora in two groups of subjects with different levels of mutans streptococci (MS). Eight subjects with low (<10(4)) and 8 with high (>10(6)) numbers of MS per millilitre saliva participated. Three 7-day test periods were conducted. During two of these, the subjects rinsed either 5 or 10 times daily with 10% sucrose; the third period without any mouth rinses served as control. The subjects refrained from oral hygiene during the last 3 days of each test period. On day 7, the following parameters were measured: plaque pH after a sucrose rinse, numbers of MS, Streptococcus sanguis and lactobacilli in saliva, percent MS in plaque and plaque index. The results revealed that plaque acidogenicity was more pronounced for the high-MS group compared to the low-MS group after all three test periods, i.e. lower resting pH, deeper pH falls and a lower final pH. For both groups, the greatest pH-lowering capacity of plaque was found after the period with 10 sucrose rinses/day. An increase in bacterial counts was noted for both groups during the test periods with the 5- and 10-time rinse regimen; this increase was larger for the high-MS group compared to the group with low MS counts. The highest plaque index was, irrespective of the test period, found for the high-MS group.
TI  - [A comparative study on the capacities of different strains of Streptococcus sanguis for P-aminobenzoic acid production].
AB  - This study was intended to compare the capacities of different strains of Strep,  sanguis for P-Aminobenzoic acid (PABA) production. The synthesis of PABA during the growth of four strains of Strep. sanguis was measured by the reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic method. The results showed that the concentrations of PABA synthesized by S. sanguis 10556, S. sanguis 10557, S. sanguis S34 and S. sanguis H7-4. Were 1.979 +/- 0.081 micrograms/ml, 1.383 +/- 0.193 micrograms/ml, 1.983 +/- 0.052 micrograms/ml and 1.032 +/- 0.229 micrograms/ml, respectively, and in term of PABA concentration, S. sanguis 10556 was significantly different from S. sanguis 10557 and S. sanguis H7-4; S. sanguis S34 was significantly different from S. sanguis 10557 and S. sanguis H7-4. No significant difference was found between S. sanguis 10556 and S. sanguis S34, nor between S. sanguis 10557 and S. sanguis H7-4, either. In conclusion, the method is simple, rapid and accurate. S. sanguis did synthesize PABA, and the difference in ability for PABA formation existed among the four strains of S. sanguis. This study is helpful to researches on the symbiosis between S. sanguis and S. muntans and to determination of their role in the microbial homeostasis of dental plaque.
TI  - Bacterial colonization of zirconia ceramic surfaces: an in vitro and in vivo study.
AB  - PURPOSE: The microbial colonization of new ceramic materials developed for abutment manufacturing was assessed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The materials used in these experiments were disks of 'as-fired' and 'rectified' ceramic material made of tetragonal zirconia polycrystals stabilized with yttrium (Y-TZP) and commercially pure grade 2 titanium (Ti) with corresponding eluates. They were tested in vitro with the following bacteria: Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus, A. naeslundii, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Proliferation was evaluated on plates by inhibitory halos around pits, previously inoculated with eluates obtained from the materials. Bacterial adhesion on materials was quantified by spectrophotometric evaluation of the slime production by the same bacteria. Moreover, early bacterial adhesion was evaluated in human volunteers and observed with SEM. RESULTS: No inhibition of bacterial proliferation using eluates was observed. In vitro as-fired and rectified Y-TZP showed significantly more adherent S. mutans than did Ti disks, while S. sanguis seemed to adhere easily to Ti specimens. No differences were noted for Actinomyces spp and P. gingivalis. In vivo Y-TZP accumulated fewer bacteria than Ti in terms of the total number of bacteria and presence of potential putative pathogens such as rods. No differences were observed between rectified and as-fired Y-TZP. DISCUSSION: Overall, Y-TZP accumulates fewer bacteria than Ti. CONCLUSION: Y-TZP may be considered as a promising material for abutment manufacturing.
TI  - Correlations between bacterial levels in autologous subgingival plaque and saliva of adult Sudanese.
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess levels of oral bacteria and their correlations in paired samples of saliva and subgingival plaque in a population of adult Sudanese. Whole saliva and pooled subgingival plaque samples from six probing sites of one tooth in each jaw were obtained from 56 Sudanese adults (mean age 35.2+/-8.9 years). Levels of 24 oral bacteria in the autologous saliva and pooled plaque sample of each subject were assessed by DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. There were significantly ( P< or =0.01) higher percentages of subjects with > or =10(5) bacterial cells of Prevotella intermedia, Campylobacter rectus, Veillonella parvula, Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus salivarius, and Leptotrichia buccalis and significantly ( P< or =0.01) lower percentages with Treponema denticola in saliva than in subgingival plaque. The detection frequencies at > or =10(6) bacterial cells were significantly higher for Selenomonas sputigena, S. anginosus, Streptococcus sanguis, and S. salivarius and significantly lower for Porphyromonas gingivalis in saliva than in subgingival plaque ( P< or =0.01). Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, S. sputigena, S. sanguis, and Streptococcus mitis demonstrated significant ( P< or =0.05) positive correlations between their levels in plaque and saliva. This study indicates that the levels of P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum, S. sputigena, S. sanguis, and S. mitis correlate significantly in saliva and subgingival plaque and that higher accuracy of detection and assessment of the levels of these bacteria in the oral cavity may be achieved by concurrent sampling of saliva and subgingival plaque.
TI  - Increased proliferative response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and T cells to Streptococcus mutans and glucosyltransferase D antigens in the exacerbation stage of recurrent aphthous ulcerations.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-induced lysis of virus-infected oral epithelial cells has been shown to be a cause of early ulcer formation in recurrent aphthous ulcerations (RAU). To test whether bacteria and their associated antigens are involved in the disease process of RAU, the proliferative response (PR) to different streptococcal species in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and T cells isolated from RAU patients at the exacerbation stage was determined. METHODS: PBMC and T cells were isolated from 39 patients with RAU, 21 patients with erosive oral lichen plaus (EOLP, disease control group), and 22 healthy subjects (normal control group). Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mitis and their associated antigen, glucosyltransferase D (GtfD), were used to stimulate isolated PBMC and T cells in in vitro proliferation assays. RESULTS: PBMC and T cells isolated from RAU patients at the exacerbation stage showed a significantly higher PR to S. mutans antigen and GtfD than those isolated from EOLP patients or healthy control subjects (p < 0.05). GtfD was a more potent stimulation antigen than S. mutans. However, elevated PRs to S. mutans antigen and GtfD were transient and present only in the exacerbation stage of RAU. These elevated PRs declined to normal levels in the postexacerbation and convalescence stages of RAU. Furthermore, the GtfD-stimulated PR in PBMC and T cells was correlated with the severity of RAU. CONCLUSION: In addition to viral infections, streptococci and their associated antigen, GtfD, may be involved in the disease process of RAU, especially in the exacerbation stage.
TI  - [Study on the biosynthesis of para-aminobenzoic acid by S. sanguis. II. Qualitative and quantitative analysis].
AB  - In this study, the method established in paper 1 was used to analyze PABA synthesized by S. sanguis S34. The results showed: 1. S. sanguis S34 did synthesize PABA and the mean concentration of PABA was 1.236 micrograms/ml. 2. the components had good linear relation and average recovery was 80%. The results of this paper will be helpful to studying influencing factors on PABA synthesis of S. sanguis and the roles of PABA in microbial homeostasis of dental plaque.
TI  - [Study on the biosynthesis of para-aminobenzoic acid by S. sanguis. I. Establishment of a reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography].
AB  - In order to study the synthesis of para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) by S. mutans and the role of PABA in the interaction between S. mutans and S. sanguis, a reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) for analysis of PABA was developed. The results showed that the optimal chromatographic parameters were flow rate of 1.5 ml/min, T = 55 +/- 2 degrees C, methanol/phosphate buffer of 10/90(by vol) (pH 2.2 0.1 mol/L), m-hydroxybenzoic acid as an internal standard. The method is simple, rapid accurate and useful.
TI  - groESL sequence determination, phylogenetic analysis, and species differentiation for viridans group streptococci.
AB  - The full-length sequences of the groESL genes (also known as cpn10/60) of Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus gordonii, and Streptococcus sanguis and the near full-length sequence of the groESL genes of Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus salivarius were determined. The lengths of the groES genes from the 10 species listed above ranged from 282 to 288 bp, and the full-length sequences of groEL determined for 4 species (S. anginosus, S. constellatus, S. gordonii, and S. sanguis) revealed that each was 1,623 bp. The intergenic region (spacer) between the groES and groEL genes varies in size (15 to 111 bp) and sequence between species. The variation of the groES sequences among the species tested was greater (62.1 to 95.1% nucleotide sequence identities) than that of the groEL sequences (77.2 to 95.2% nucleotide sequence identities). Phylogenetic analysis of the groES and groEL genes yielded evolutionary trees similar to the tree constructed by use of the 16S rRNA gene. The intraspecies variation of the spacer was minimal for clinical isolates of some species. The groESL sequence data provide an additional parameter for identification of viridans group streptococcal species.
TI  - Intracellular and extracellular pHs of Streptococcus mutans after addition of acids: loading and efflux of a fluorescent pH indicator in streptococcal cells.
AB  - A pH-sensitive fluorescent dye, 2', 7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5 and 6-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF), was used to determine intracellular pH (pH(in)). The efflux of BCECF loaded into oral streptococcal cells was determined after incubation of the cells at 35 degrees C for 20 min in the presence and absence of glucose. In the absence of glucose, the fluorescence of intracellular BCECF in Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus sobrinus decreased only very slightly, indicating that the dye could be useful for pH(in) determination. In the presence of glucose, however, the fluorescence decreased by 57%. Thus, the pH(in) of S. mutans cells was measured by the BCECF method in the absence of glucose at various acidic pH levels by adding lactic, acetic and hydrochloric acids to the cell suspensions. The pH(in) was almost equal to the extracellular pH (pH(out)) for pH(out) values of between 8 and 5, indicating that protons permeated easily across the S. mutans cell membrane. For pH(out) between 5 and 4, pH(in) was constant at around 5, suggesting that the cell membrane was impermeable to protons, or that a cytoplasmic buffering system functioned. pH(in) decreased at pH(out) values of < 4. The constant pH(in) at acidic pH(out) levels could protect intracellular components, such as proteins, against acidification by sugar fermentation.
TI  - Roles of salivary proteins in the adherence of oral streptococci to various orthodontic brackets.
AB  - Knowledge of salivary pellicles on orthodontic brackets provides a better understanding of microbial adherence. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of bracket pellicles on the adherence of Streptococcus gordonii and Streptococcus mutans. Bracket pellicles were formed by the incubation of 4 kinds of orthodontic brackets with unstimulated whole saliva for 2 hrs, and analyzed by electrophoresis, immunodetection, and amino acid analysis. Binding assays were then performed by the incubation of tritium-labeled streptococci with the pellicle-transfer blots and orthodontic brackets. The results showed that low-molecular-weight mucin, alpha-amylase, secretory IgA, acidic proline-rich proteins, and cystatins adhered to all kinds of brackets, though the amino acid composition of pellicles differed between bracket types. Some of these proteins increased the binding of S. gordonii to saliva-coated brackets. However, salivary pellicles decreased the binding of S. mutans. Collectively, salivary pellicles were found to play a significant role in the initial adhesion of oral streptococci to orthodontic brackets.
TI  - Salivary microbiota levels in relation to periodontal status, experience of caries and miswak use in Sudanese adults.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present investigation was to assess the salivary levels of 25 oral bacteria in relation to periodontal status and experience of caries, and to compare the levels of these bacteria between habitual miswak and toothbrush users in adult Sudanese subjects. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study subjects consisted of 56 individuals with age range 19-53 years (mean 35.2 years) and included 30 miswak and 26 toothbrush users. The periodontal status and presence of dental caries were assessed clinically. Whole saliva was collected from all subjects, and the levels of 25 selected bacterial species in saliva were assessed by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method using whole genomic DNA probes. RESULTS: A high percentage of the subjects had detectable levels (> or = 105 bacterial cells) of several bacterial species in saliva. Between 12% and 16% of the subjects showed high (> or = 106 cells) salivary levels of the periodontitis-associated bacteria A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, C. rectus and E. corrodens, whereas only two (3.6%) and four (7.1%) subjects had high levels of P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum, respectively. There were no significant differences in the levels of all or most bacterial species by age group, gender or periodontal status. Presence of > or = 105 L. acidophilus bacterial cells in saliva was associated with high caries scores (p = 0.02). There were significantly higher levels of A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. melaninogenica, C. rectus, P. micros, V. parvula, S. mutans, S. anginosus, A. israelii, C. sputigena, and C. gingivalis, and significantly lower levels of P. intermedia, F. nucleatum, S. sputigena, E. corrodens, L. acidophilus, S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. oralis, and S. mitis in the miswak than in the toothbrush group. CONCLUSIONS: : The findings suggest that miswak may have a selective inhibitory effect on the level of certain bacteria in saliva, particularly several oral streptococci species. This is the first report that the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method can be useful for assessing the levels of a wide range of bacterial taxa in saliva.
TI  - Effects of glucose and fluoride on competition and metabolism within in vitro dental bacterial communities and biofilms.
AB  - Antimicrobial effects of fluoride in vivo remain contentious. Previous studies suggested that 1 mM NaF reduced acid production from glucose, and prevented the enrichment of bacteria associated with caries in a chemostat model. The present study examines the effects of a lower fluoride concentration (0.53 mM, 10 ppm NaF) in both biofilm and planktonic microbial communities. Nine oral species were grown at pH 7.0 and pulsed on 10 successive days with glucose; bacterial metabolism was allowed to reduce the pH for 6 h before being returned to neutrality, either in the presence or absence of NaF. In addition, 10-day-old mixed culture biofilms were overlaid with glucose, with or without NaF, and the pH change followed by microelectrode. After 10 days, chemostat pH dropped to ca. pH 4.5 following glucose pulses, and the community was dominated by Streptococcus mutans (rising from 4 to 23% of total CFU) and Veillonella dispar (16 to 73%). In comparison, after 10 days pulsing with glucose + fluoride, the final pH was significantly higher (ca. pH 4.9) (paired t test, p < 0.0001). The culture was predominated by V. dispar (70%) and Actinomyces naeslundii (13%), whereas S. mutans proportions were significantly lower (t test, p = 0.04), remaining <3% of the total flora, compared to the culture without fluoride. Biofilm pH fell to only pH 5.55 1 h after glucose/fluoride overlay, compared to 4.55 with glucose alone (paired t test, p < 0.000001). Analysis of the data suggests that fluoride exerts dual antimicrobial modes of action. Fluoride prevents enrichment of S. mutans by inhibiting critical metabolic processes (direct effect) and, in an inter-related way, by reducing environmental acidification (indirect effect) in biofilms.
TI  - The antimicrobial properties of a urea-based handwash lotion with triclosan.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine and compare the antimicrobial action of a urea-based handwash lotion with triclosan with a lipid-depleting detergent-based handwash product with 4% chlorhexidine gluconate. The zones of inhibition produced by the two handwash lotions and the one produced by the positive control were similar against all strains of bacteria tested, indicating that a urea-based handwash lotion with triclosan is as effective as a lipid-depleting handwash lotion in inhibiting bacterial activity.
TI  - Simultaneous measurement of the viability, aggregation, and live and dead adherence of Streptococcus crista, Streptococcus mutans and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in human saliva in relation to indices of caries, dental plaque and periodontal disease.
AB  - Salivary proteins have multiple functions and many share similar functions, which may be why it has been difficult to relate variations in their concentrations to oral health and ecology. An alternative is to focus on variations in the major functions of saliva. An hydroxyapatite-coated microplate model has been developed that simultaneously measures saliva-promoted bacterial viability, bacterial aggregation, and live and dead bacterial adherence, while simulating oral temperature and shearing forces from swallowing. That model was applied to resting whole and stimulated parotid saliva from 149 individuals, using representative strains of Streptococcus crista, S. mutans, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Two major factors were defined by multivariate analysis (this was successful only for whole-saliva). One factor was correlated with aggregation, live adherence and dead adherence for all three strains; the other was correlated with total viability of all three strains. Participants were grouped <25th percentile and >75th percentile for each factor. Those groups were compared for clinical indices of oral health. Caries scores were significantly lower in those with high scores for aggregation-adherence, regardless of whether total viability scores were low or high. Live bacteria always predominated on surfaces when live and dead adherence scores were expressed as ratios. However, participants with high scores for aggregation-adherence showed significantly more dead adherent bacteria than those with low scores (these ratios were uncorrelated with total viability). This finding may indicate that extreme differences in the ability to kill bacteria on surfaces can influence caries risk.
TI  - Preventing the transfer of Streptococcus mutans from primary molars to permanent  first molars using chlorhexidine.
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine if the application of 1% chlorhexidine-containing wax on primary molars during the period of eruption of the first permanent molars could prevent the transfer of certain oral flora, namely Streptococcus mutans, to the permanent molars. METHODS: Fourteen children with a mean age of 6.5 years (7 males and 7 females) were assigned into two groups: a chlorhexidine group (n=9) in which 1% chlorhexidine-containing wax was painted on primary molars on one side of the mouth; and a placebo wax group (n=5) in which a similar wax, but without chlorhexidine, was painted on primary molars on the other side of the mouth. Baseline saliva samples and pooled plaque samples from the primary molars on both sides of the dentition were obtained from the two treatment groups. Following treatment, plaque samples from the occlusal fissures of the first permanent molars on both sides of the dentition were obtained. The levels of S.mutans and other members of the oral flora on the treated sides (chlorhexidine or placebo) were compared with those on the untreated sides. RESULTS: The results showed that the proportions of S.mutans to S.sanguinis were significantly lower in the chlorhexidine-treated sides compared to the untreated (P=0.04) and in the chlorhexidine-treated patients compared to placebo (P=0.029). CONCLUSIONS: Since lower mutans to sanguinis ratios have been associated with lower caries experience, treating primary molars with 1% chlorhexidine wax during eruption of permanent first molars may be a simple means for shifting the fissure flora of the permanent molars towards a more favorable balance.
TI  - Effects of compounds found in propolis on Streptococcus mutans growth and on glucosyltransferase activity.
AB  - Propolis, a resinous bee product, has been shown to inhibit the growth of oral microorganisms and the activity of bacterium-derived glucosyltransferases (GTFs). Several compounds, mainly polyphenolics, have been identified in this natural product. The present study evaluated the effects of distinct chemical groups found in propolis on the activity of GTF enzymes in solution and on the surface of saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sHA) beads. Thirty compounds, including flavonoids, cinnamic acid derivatives, and terpenoids, were tested for the ability to inhibit GTFs B, C, and D from Streptococcus mutans and GTF from S. sanguinis (GTF Ss). Flavones and flavonols were potent inhibitors of GTF activity in solution; lesser effects were noted on insolubilized enzymes. Apigenin, a 4',5,7-trihydroxyflavone, was the most effective inhibitor of GTFs, both in solution (90.5 to 95% inhibition at a concentration of 135 microg/ml) and on the surface of sHA beads (30 to 60% at 135 microg/ml). Antibacterial activity was determined by using MICs, minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs), and time-kill studies. Flavanones and some dihydroflavonols, as well as the sesquiterpene tt-farnesol, inhibited the growth of S. mutans and S. sobrinus; tt-farnesol was the most effective antibacterial compound (MICs of 14 to 28 microg/ml and MBCs of 56 to 112 microg/ml). tt-Farnesol (56 to 112 microg/ml) produced a 3-log-fold reduction in the bacterial population after 4 h of incubation. Cinnamic acid derivatives had negligible biological activities. Several of the compounds identified in propolis inhibit GTF activities and bacterial growth. Apigenin is a novel and potent inhibitor of GTF activity, and tt-farnesol was found to be an effective antibacterial agent.
TI  - Fluoride and organic weak acids as respiration inhibitors for oral streptococci in acidified environments.
AB  - Oxygen metabolism (respiration) of Streptococcus mutans GS-5 involving NADH oxidases, mainly of the H(2)O-producing type, was found to be acid sensitive, as was NADH oxidase activity of cell extracts. Respiration of intact cells in acidified media was also highly sensitive to fluoride, with a 50% inhibitory concentration of about 0.02 mM at pH 4. In contrast, NADH oxidases in cell extracts were fluoride insensitive. Fluoride inhibition of respiration of intact cells was related to weak-acid effects leading to enhanced proton permeability of cells, cytoplasmic acidification and resultant acid inhibition of NADH oxidases and glycolysis. Organic weak acids, such as indomethacin and benzoate, were also effective inhibitors. H(2)O(2) production by intact cells of Streptococcus sanguis NCTC 10904, a peroxide producer, was similarly inhibited by fluoride or organic weak acids in acidified media. Thus, weak acids act as respiratory inhibitors for oral streptococci indirectly by acidifying the cytoplasm rather than acting as direct inhibitors of NADH oxidases.
TI  - Repressed respiration of oral streptococci grown in biofilms.
AB  - The respiratory activities of oral streptococci grown in biofilms were found to be markedly repressed compared with those of cells from aerobic culture, or for Streptococcus mutans GS-5, even for those grown in static culture. Respiration rates generally reflected levels of NADH oxidase activities in cell extracts. Superoxide dismutase levels were somewhat reduced in biofilm cells. However, sensitivities to oxidative damage caused by H2O2, t-butylhydroperoxide, or 8-hydroxyquinoline were not greatly different for cells from suspension cultures and those from either intact or dispersed biofilms. The capacities of S. sanguis and S. gordonii to produce H2O2 also were markedly repressed by biofilm growth, and presumably this repression would affect the ecology of dental plaque by reducing oxidative stresses under crowded conditions.
TI  - Molecular analysis of bacterial species associated with childhood caries.
AB  - Although substantial epidemiologic evidence links Streptococcus mutans to caries, the pathobiology of caries may involve more complex communities of bacterial species. Molecular methods for bacterial identification and enumeration now make it possible to more precisely study the microbiota associated with dental caries. The purpose of this study was to compare the bacteria found in early childhood caries (ECC) to those found in caries-free children by using molecular identification methods. Cloning and sequencing of bacterial 16S ribosomal DNAs from a healthy subject and a subject with ECC were used for identification of novel species or uncultivated phylotypes and species not previously associated with dental caries. Ten novel phylotypes were identified. A number of species or phylotypes that may play a role in health or disease were identified and warrant further investigation. In addition, quantitative measurements for 23 previously known bacterial species or species groups were obtained by a reverse capture checkerboard assay for 30 subjects with caries and 30 healthy controls. Significant differences were observed for nine species: S. sanguinis was associated with health and, in order of decreasing cell numbers, Actinomyces gerencseriae, Bifidobacterium, S. mutans, Veillonella, S. salivarius, S. constellatus, S. parasanguinis, and Lactobacillus fermentum were associated with caries. These data suggest that A. gerencseriae and other Actinomyces species may play an important role in caries initiation and that a novel Bifidobacterium may be a major pathogen in deep caries. Further investigation could lead to the identification of targets for biological interventions in the caries process and thereby contribute to improved prevention of and treatment for this significant public health problem.
TI  - A protocol for polymerase chain reaction detection of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium from the root canal.
AB  - AIM: The present study was set up to develop a protocol for detection of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium from the root canal. METHODOLOGY: A collection of type strains and clinical isolates ol E. faecalis and faecium was used. Specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers targeted against the 16S/23S rDNA intergenic region were used and PCR reactions were set up. PCR products were run on TBE-agarose gel and analysed. The sensitivity of the PCR systems was studied using serial dilutions of (i) bacterial DNA and (ii) bacterial cells from E. faecalis. The specificity of the identification was tested against closely related species. RESULTS: All strains of E. faecalis and E. faecium produced identical amplicon profiles composed of two major bands corresponding to sizes of 320 and 420 bp. When amplifying DNA of higher purity, a third band of 600 bp became evident as well. Closely related species demonstrated single bands of various sizes and were easily distinguished from enterococci. The detection level of DNA from serial dilutions of DNA was 10(-13) g. The DNA extraction protocol from bacterial cell suspensions resulted in a detection level of 10 bacterial cells per sample. CONCLUSIONS The present study demonstrated a good potential for using PCR technology in the detection of F. faecalis and E. faecium from root canal samples. With a high specificity the methodology was able to detect 10 cells of E. faecalis.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of four root canal sealers against endodontic pathogens.
AB  - The antibacterial effects of various types of widely used endodontic sealers have not been compared systematically on facultative or obligate anaerobic endodontic pathogens. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of four commonly used endodontic sealers: two epoxy-resin-based sealers (AH26, AH plus), one zinc-oxide eugenol-based sealer (N2), and one calcium hydroxide-based sealer (Sealapex). The testing microbes were four facultative anaerobic species (Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus) and four obligate anaerobic species (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Prevotella intermedia). The freshly mixed sealers were placed into the prepared wells of agar plates inoculated with the test microorganisms. After varying periods of incubation (2 days for facultative anaerobic species and 7 days for obligate anaerobic species), the zones of growth inhibition were observed and measured. All the sealers were distinctly different from each other in their antimicrobial activity. The sealers showed different inhibitory effects depending on the types and bacterial strains. N2 containing formaldehyde and eugenol proved to be the most effective against the microorganisms. The extreme antimicrobial potency of this root canal sealer must be weighted against its pronounced tissue toxic effect.
TI  - The predominant microflora of nursing caries lesions.
AB  - The predominant microflora recovered from infected dentine of 52 carious teeth from 14 children with nursing caries was determined using both selective and non-selective media for the isolation of specific genera and acidified media (pH 5.2) to isolate the predominant aciduric microorganisms, and compared with the microflora of sound enamel surfaces in caries-free children. Streptococcus mutans formed a significantly greater proportion of the lesion flora while Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus gordonii formed a significantly greater proportion of the plaque flora from sound tooth surfaces. The proportions of Actinomyces naeslundii and Actinomyces odontolyticus were significantly greater in the plaque samples than in the lesion samples. Actinomyces israelii formed 18.2% of the flora from the lesions, but was not isolated from the plaque samples. The proportions of Candida albicans, Lactobacillus spp. and Veillonella spp. were also significantly greater in the carious dentine than in the plaque samples. The most frequently isolated lactobacilli were Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus rhamnosus. The predominant aciduric flora was S. oralis, S. mutans and A. israelii and these taxa were also isolated from a similar proportion of the lesions at pH 7.0. Strains of S. mutans, L. casei, L. fermentum and L. rhamnosus isolated from individual carious teeth were genotyped using PCR-based methods. Each species was genotypically heterogeneous and different genotypes were recovered from different carious teeth in the same child. These data indicate that the microflora of lesions in the same child is microbiologically diverse and support a non-specific aetiology for nursing caries in which the physiological characteristics of the infecting flora, not its composition, is the major determinant underlying the disease process.
TI  - Dysregulation of monocyte oxidative burst in streptococcal endocarditis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcal subacute endocarditis is characterized by low-grade systemic inflammation. Although structural cardiac defects are pivotal, phagocytic cells, i.e. monocytes and neutrophils, are involved in the induction and the course of bacterial endocarditis. Decreased production of reactive oxygen metabolites was described in long-lasting infections. We hypothesized that the oxidative burst of phagocytes induced by the infecting organism is defective in patients with streptococcal endocarditis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The monocytes and neutrophils of 11 patients with streptococcal native valve endocarditis were challenged with the respective pathogens and two control streptococcal strains, and the oxidative burst was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. These experiments were done before any antibiotic therapy was administered, and repeated at least 12 months after recovery. Eight volunteers served as healthy controls. RESULTS: The monocyte response to the respective pathogens was decreased in the patient groups compared to the response to the control streptococci. After cure the monocyte response to the pathogens was not different to the response to the control strains. The monocyte response of the healthy volunteers did not show any differences between the patients' pathogens and the control strains. The neutrophil oxidative burst to the pathogens was similar to that to the control streptococci in both patient and the volunteer group. CONCLUSION: The decreased response of patient monocytes to the pathogens may contribute to the low-grade inflammatory response and to the course of streptococcal endocarditis.
TI  - Plaque formation on surface modified dental implants. An in vitro study.
AB  - Bacterial adhesion on titanium implant surfaces has a strong influence on healing and long-term outcome of dental implants. Parameters like surface roughness and chemical composition of the implant surface were found to have a significant impact on plaque formation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of two physical hard coatings on bacterial adhesion in comparison with control surfaces of equivalent roughness. Two members of the oral microflora, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis were used. Commercially pure titanium discs were modified using four different surface treatments: physical vapour deposition (PVD) with either titanium nitride (TiN) or zirconium nitride (ZrN), thermal oxidation and structuring with laser radiation. Polished titanium surfaces were used as controls. Surface topography was examined by SEM and estimation of surface roughness was done using a contact stylus profilometer. Contact angle measurements were carried out to calculate surface energy. Titanium discs were incubated in the respective bacterial cell suspension for one hour and single colonies formed by adhering bacteria were counted by fluorescence microscopy. Contact angle measurements showed no significant differences between the surface modifications. The surface roughness (Ra) of all surfaces examined was between 0.14 and 1.00 microm. A significant reduction of the number of adherent bacteria was observed on inherently stable titanium hard materials such as TiN and ZrN and thermically oxidated titanium surfaces compared to polished titanium. In conclusion, physical modification of titanium implant surfaces such as coating with TiN or ZrN may reduce bacterial adherence and hence improve clinical results.
TI  - Proteolytic degradation of oral biofilms in vitro and in vivo: potential of proteases originating from Euphausia superba for plaque control.
AB  - This paper deals with enzymatic removal of dental plaque, in vitro as well as in  vivo, using proteases from the Antarctic krill shrimp (Euphausia superba), referred to as Krillase. Krillase exhibits both endo- and exopeptidase activity but has no microbicidal effect. In model systems with pure cultures of oral microorganisms. Krillase demonstrated inhibition of microbial adhesion to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite. Furthermore, a protocol for the growth of reproducible in vitro plaque films has been developed, and effects of Krillase on the plaque film were investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed that Krillase efficiently released microorganisms from plaque in vitro, the effect being dependent on the enzymatic activity. The surface energy of the substratum had a minor influence on the formation and removal of plaque in vitro. Ellipsometric studies on the formation and enzymatic removal of a salivary pellicle indicated that the enzymatic effect on plaque may partly depend on degradation of the salivary pellicle. Krillase was also able to remove plaque accumulated on dentures in vivo. Our results demonstrate the potential of Krillase for plaque control, and that these enzymes are worthy of further investigations including clinical studies and work to find a suitable vehicle.
TI  - Plaque removal characteristics of electric toothbrushes using an in vitro plaque  model.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: The purpose of the study was to investigate and quantify the efficacy of plaque removal by commercially available electric toothbrushes using an in vitro system based on artificial plaque grown on glass slides. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Artificial plaque based on Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mutans was cultured in a series of phosphate buffer solution, sucrose solution and brain heart infusion on sterile glass slides, for a period of 5 weeks. 7 different electric toothbrushes of current designs were operated in contact with the glass slides under loads of 1 or 2N for 10 s after which image analysis of the brushed slides was undertaken to calculate the absolute and relative areas of removal. RESULTS: The electric toothbrushes showed a larger area of plaque removal as loading force increased from 1 to 2N. The area of biofilm removed also depended on the head design and ranged from 258 mm(2) (1N, Interplak) and 314 mm(2) (2N, Interplak), to 30 mm(2) (1N, Braun 3D), and 148 mm(2) (2N, Blend-a-Dent). The area of biofilm removal was significantly different among all electric toothbrushes at p<0.01 (ANOVA). All electric toothbrushes removed more biofilm than the actual contacting tufted area of the head. CONCLUSION: The artificial plaque model system under different loading conditions showed differences in the absolute area of removal per electric toothbrush and also differences in the relative removal per unit contact bristle area. These differences on operating variables should be considered when evaluating new electric toothbrushes.
TI  - Efficacy of manual and powered toothbrushes (II). Effect on microbiological parameters.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: The purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (Crest Complete) or power (Braun 3D Plaque Remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. METHODS: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. At baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. After random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. Clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. Significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the Quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: Mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. Actinomyces naeslundii and Actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. Streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while Streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. Mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. Major reductions occurred in both groups for A. naeslundii, A. israelii/gerencseriae, Peptostreptococcus micros, Veillonella parvula, Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, S. mitis/oralis/sanguis and S. constellatus/intermedius. All taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. The reductions in prevalence were greater for A. naeslundii, S. constellatus/intermedius, V. parvula, A. israelii/gerencseriae, S. mitis/oralis/sanguis, P. micros, Streptococcus mutans and P. intermedia/nigrescens. Mean prevalence was decreased more for Porphyromonas gingivalis, Campylobacter rectus/showae, Treponema denticola and Bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. CONCLUSIONS: The major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the subgingival microbiota. Counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. This reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. Further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.
TI  - Cariogenic potential of lactosylfructoside as determined by acidogenicity of oral streptococci in vitro and human dental plaque in situ.
AB  - The cariogenic potential of lactosylfructoside [O-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1-->4)-O-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1<-->2)-beta-D-fruct ofuranoside] was estimated by experiments on oral streptococci in vitro and human dental plaque in situ. Lactosylfructoside was unable to support growth of the strains of Streptococcus mutans and S. sobrinus used in this study. However, it was able to support growth of strains of S. sanguis, S. mitis and S. oralis. Acid was produced rapidly by cell suspensions of S. oralis ATCC 10557 incubated with lactosylfructoside. Application of 5% w/v solution decreased the pH of human dental plaque. The minimum pH value was below 5.3. The results suggest that lactosylfructoside is as acidogenic as lactose and could be cariogenic if it is consumed frequently and retained for a long period in the mouth.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against oral microorganisms.
AB  - Bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of Psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to China with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. In this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. The cell growth of Streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of S. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. The bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on S. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); pH, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). Bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including S. mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sobrinus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Actinomyces viscosus, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, with MICs ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. Furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of S. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of pH in the broth. Thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.
TI  - Alteration of the coadherence of Candida albicans with oral bacteria by dietary sugars.
AB  - Interactions between bacterial oral flora and Candida albicans are important in denture plaque formation. This study therefore first aimed to quantify the coadherence of C. albicans and bacteria by the use of a bioluminescent adenosine triphosphate (ATP) assay based on the firefly luciferase-luciferin system. The second aim was to examine the effect of i) dietary sugars (used for preculture) and ii) enzymatic digestion of fungi on the coadherence. When yeast was preincubated in yeast nitrogen base medium (YNB) supplemented with 250 mM glucose, the yeast coadhered with all isolates of Streptoccus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis, and no significant coadhesion was observed with the isolates of Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus and Actinomyces. However, when the yeast was precultured in YNB supplemented with 500 mM galactose, the yeast coadhered with S. salivarius and Actinomyces, which was not observed when the yeast was grown in YNB with glucose. In addition, the coadherence of the yeast with the isolates of S. sanguis was significantly reduced. Enzymatic digestion of yeast and a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay revealed that expression of at least two types of proteinaceous adhesins are involved in these phenomena.
TI  - The ability of direct fluorescence-based, two-colour assays to detect different physiological states of oral streptococci.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the ability of six fluorescent-based, two-colour viability assays to detect different physiological growth stages of two oral streptococci species. METHODS AND RESULTS: The growth of Streptococcus sanguinis and Strep. mutans from 0 to 73 h culture periods was monitored by cell labelling with six mixtures of fluorescent stains, in addition to the growth parameters optical density (O.D.), log values of the total cell counts (log BC ml(-1)) and of the colony-forming units (log cfu ml(-1)). CONCLUSION: In comparison with the corresponding cfu values as control, the vitality proportions determined by the Syto 9/PI test best reflected the dynamic growth pattern of both test strains. The direct fluorescent-based, two-colour assay Syto 9/PI provides valuable information about microbial viability stages. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The detection of viable but non-culturable bacteria requires more precise direct methods such as the fluorescent staining technique presented here, in addition to the classical plate count method.
TI  - Bacterial detachment from salivary conditioning films by dentifrice supernates.
AB  - This study compared the detachment by supernates of nine different dentifrices of four oral bacterial strains adhering to a salivary pellicle in a parallel plate flow chamber. Ultra-thin bovine enamel slabs were coated for 1.5 h with human whole saliva. Following buffer rinsing, a bacterial suspension of Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans or Actinomyces naeslundii was perfused through the flow chamber at a shear rate of 30 s-1 for four hours, and the number of adhering bacteria n4h was enumerated by image analysis after buffer rinsing at the same shear rate. Then, a 25 wt%-dentifrice/water supernate was perfused through the flow chamber for four minutes, followed by eight minutes of buffer rinsing and another enumeration of the number of bacteria that had remained adhering nad. Finally, an air-bubble was passed through the flow chamber to mimic the occasionally high detachment forces occurring in the oral cavity, and the adhering bacteria nab were counted again. On average, S. sanguis was the easiest to detach (73% averaged over all dentifrice supernates), while A. naeslundii was the most difficult (22% on average). The combined detachment of bacteria by dentifrice supernates and air-bubble ranged from a low of 16% to a high of 80%. Dentifrices containing pyrophosphate and polymeric polyphosphate (hexametaphosphate) surface active ingredients appeared to produce the most consistent and strongest desorption effects on plaque bacteria. Factors apparently important to bacterial detachment from pellicle-covered tooth surfaces by dentifrice formulations include the nature of adhesion of bacterial strains and chemical composition of the dentifrice formulations, including pH, surfactant system and the effect of added ingredients (dispersants, metal ions, peroxides, baking soda).
TI  - Enterococcus faecalis--a mechanism for its role in endodontic failure.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to identify a possible mechanism that would explain how E. faecalis could survive and grow within dentinal tubules and reinfect an obturated root canal. METHODOLOGY: Cells of Streptococcus gordonii DL1, Streptococcus mutans NG8, or E. faecalis JH2-2 were grown in brain heart infusion broth containing various amounts of human serum for 56 days. The ability of the three species to invade dentine and bind to immobilized type I collagen in the presence of human serum was assessed by dentine invasion and microtitre well experiments. RESULTS: All three species remained viable over the period of the experiment when grown in human serum. Cells of all three bacteria were able to invade dentine and bind to immobilized collagen. Both of these properties were inhibited by the presence of collagen in the cell solution. Human serum inhibited dentine invasion and collagen adhesion by S. gordonii DL1 and S. mutans NG8, whilst dentine invasion by E. faecalis JH2-2 was reduced in the presence of serum, but not inhibited, and binding to collagen was enhanced. CONCLUSIONS: It is postulated that a virulence factor of E. faecalis in failed endodontically treated teeth may be related to the ability of E. faecalis cells to maintain the capability to invade dentinal tubules and adhere to collagen in the presence of human serum.
TI  - Inhibitory effects of MoAbs against a surface protein antigen in real-time adherence in vitro and recolonization in vivo of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - A surface protein antigen (PAc) of Streptococcus mutans, particularly the A-region of the molecule, has been reported to interact with salivary components on the tooth surface. It might be a candidate antigen inducing the production of antibodies against the adherence of S. mutans to the tooth surface. We investigated the effects of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) obtained by immunization of synthetic PAc peptides that completely correspond to the amino acid sequence of part of the A-region. These MoAbs recognize several core B-cell epitopes in the sequence. Two (KH5 and SH2) of these antibodies reacted with both S. mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus, but not with Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Porphyromonas gingivalis or Lactobacillus casei. They clearly inhibited the real-time adherence of S. mutans to salivary components in a biosensor. KH5, which showed a real-time inhibition (71%), also significantly prevented the recolonization of S. mutans on the tooth surface in rats. These results suggested that the core B-cell epitope (-Y---L--Y----) recognized by KH5 was the essential sequence in the antigenic epitopes of PAc protein recognized specifically by the inhibitory antibody. Therefore, the amino acid residues were found to be important in the initial attachment of S. mutans to the tooth surface. These results provide for the mechanism of PAc molecule in the initial attachment of S. mutans on the tooth surface and more effective designs for the removal of S. mutans and S. sobrinus from the oral cavity.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of particulate bioglass against supra- and subgingival bacteria.
AB  - Particulate Bioglass is a bioactive material used in the repair of periodontal defects. This material undergoes a series of surface reactions in an aqueous environment which lead to osseointegration. The aim of this study was to determine whether these reactions exerted an antibacterial effect on a range of oral bacteria. Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans and Actinomyces viscosus were suspended in nutrient broth (NB), artificial saliva (AS) or Dulbecco's modified eagle medium plus 10% foetal calf serum (DMEM + 10%FCS), with or without particulate Bioglass. All bacteria showed reduced viability following exposure to Bioglass in all the media after 1 h. This antibacterial effect increased after 3 h. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were suspended in either BM broth or 40% horse serum (HS) in RPMI. A considerable reduction in viability was observed with all bacteria tested, in both media, compared to inert glass controls. In further experiments it was found that the viability of S. sanguis was significantly reduced following exposure to NB pre-incubated with Bioglass. Additionally, it was found that neutralisation of this highly alkaline solution eliminated the antibacterial effect. Moreover, a solution of NB and NaOH (of equivalent pH) exerted an antibacterial effect of similar magnitude to that of the solution pre-incubated with Bioglass. Thus, particulate Bioglass exerts an antibacterial effect on certain oral bacteria, possibly by virtue of the alkaline nature of its surface reactions. This may reduce bacterial colonisation of its surface in vivo.
TI  - Effects of three different infant dentifrices on biofilms and oral microorganisms.
AB  - The purpose of this work was to evaluate the effects of infant dentifrices: A--with lactoperoxidase, glucose oxidase and lactoferrin; B--with 1100 ppm of NaF and sodium lauryl sulfate; C--with extract of calendula. The dentifrices were test on biofilms formed in vitro from saliva and dental plaque of infants, using reference strains A. viscosus (ATCC 43146); C. albicans (ATCC 51501); L. casei (ATCC 4646); S. mitis (ATCC 49456); S. mutans (ATCC 25175); S. oralis (ATCC 35037); S. sanguis (ATCC 10586); S. sobrinus (ATCC 27609) and isolated clinically microorganisms C. albicans, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. sanguis, S. sobrinus and Lactobacillus sp. Twenty infants were chosen, who were beginning treatment at the Infants Clinic of the Pediatric Dentistry Department, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. A pool of unstimulated saliva and a pool of dental plaque were collected from which biofilms were produced. Supernatants from each dentifrice were prepared and concentrated and diluted solutions of the dentifrices and a control sterile diluent were tested against the biofilms produced, for 1 and 3 minutes, and against the microorganisms. The results were statistically analyzed by the ANOVA and Tukey Test. After the exposure of the biofilms produced both from saliva and from dental plaque, to the dentifrice B concentrated and 1/2, for 1 and 3 minutes, the viable microorganisms count (CFU/ml), compared to the controls, was significantly reduced (p < 0.05). However, exposure to the dentifrices A and C concentrated and dentifrice B 1/4 and 1/8, for 1 and 3 minutes, was not significantly lethal to the biofilms. The dentifrices A and C, either concentrated or diluted (1/2 to 1/128) and the dentifrice B in the dilutions 1/16 to 1/128 did not have an antimicrobial effect on any microorganism evaluated. For all the microorganisms evaluated, the dentifrice B concentrated and in the 1/2 dilution showed a significant antimicrobial effect, when compared with the control (p < 0.05).
TI  - Oral colonization and cariogenicity of Streptococcus gordonii in specific pathogen-free TAN:SPFOM(OM)BR rats consuming starch or sucrose diets.
AB  - The significance of Streptococcus gordonii in dental caries is undefined, as is that of other alpha-amylase-binding bacteria (ABB) commonly found in the mouth. To clarify the ecological and cariological roles of S. gordonii our specific pathogen-free Osborne-Mendel rats, TAN:SPFOM(OM)BR, were fed either diet 2000 (containing 56% confectioner's sugar, most of which is sucrose) or diet 2000CS (containing 56% cornstarch, in lieu of confectioner's sugar) and inoculated with S. gordonii strains. Uninoculated rats were free of both indigenous mutans streptococci (MS) and ABB, including S. gordonii, as shown by culture on mitis salivarius and blood agars of swabs and sonicates of dentitions after weanlings had consumed these diets for 26 days. ABB were detected by radiochemical assay using [125I]-amylase reactive to alpha-amylase-binding protein characteristic of the surface of S. gordonii and other ABB. No ABB were detected (detection limit < 1 colony-forming units in 10(6) colony-forming units). Thus the TAN:SPFOM(OM)BR colony presents a 'clean animal model' for subsequent study. Consequently, S. gordonii strains Challis or G9B were used to inoculate weanling rat groups consuming either the high-sucrose diet 2000 or the cornstarch diet 2000CS. Two additional groups fed each of these diets remained unioculated. Recoveries of inoculants were tested 12 and 26 days later by oral swabs and sonication of the molars of one hemimandible of each animal, respectively. Uninoculated animals were reconfirmed to be free of ABB and mutans streptococci, but inoculated ones eating diet 2000CS had S. gordonii recoveries of 1-10% or, if eating diet 2000, 10-30% of total colony-farming units in sonicates. There were no statistically significant differences among the inoculated and uninoculated animal groups' caries scores when they ate the cornstarch diet. Lesion scores for sucrose-eating rats were, however, from 2.4-5.1-fold higher than for cornstarch-eating rats, P < 0.001, and were still higher if animals had been inoculated with either Challis (1.41-fold) or G9B (1.64-fold), than if uninoculated, both P < 0.001, so long as the rats ate the sucrose diet. Therefore, TAN:SPFOM(OM)BR rats do not harbour ABB or S. gordonii but can be colonized by S. gordonii. Colonization levels of S. gordonii on the teeth are higher in the presence of high sucrose than with high starch-containing diets. Caries scores are augmented by sucrose compared with starch, and are further augmented by S gordonii colonization. S. gordonii is thus cariologically significant in the presence of sucrose, at least in this rat.
TI  - Binding of oral streptococci to human fibrinogen.
AB  - The interaction of oral streptococci with human fibrinogen was investigated. Streptococcus gordonii was chosen as a representative species to study the binding to fibrinogen. S. gordonii DL1 adhered to immobilized fibrinogen and bovine serum albumin. Binding to immobilized fibrinogen was saturable, concentration and temperature dependent. The binding of S. gordonii DL1 to fibrinogen was inhibited by anti-fibrinogen antibody. Heating of the bacteria for 1 h at 95 degrees C resulted in 90% inhibition of the binding. Trypsin treatment of the bacteria resulted in decreased binding. Neither lipoteichoic acid nor culturing of the bacteria in a sucrose-supplemented medium had any effect on the binding. S. gordonii, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mitis, and Streptococcus oralis bound to the immobilized fibrinogen, but mutans streptococci did not. None of the oral streptococci tested bound to the fibrinogen in fluid phase. These results suggest that the binding of S. gordonii DL1 to immobilized fibrinogen is mediated through a specific protein adhesin-receptor interaction, and fibrinogen acts as a cryptitope.
TI  - Mannosidase production by viridans group streptococci.
AB  - The production of mannosidase activity by all currently recognized species of human viridans group streptococci was determined using an assay in which bacterial growth was dependent on the degradation of the high-mannose-type glycans of RNase B and subsequent utilization of released mannose. RNase B is an excellent substrate for the demonstration of mannosidase activity since it is a glycoprotein with a single glycosylation site which is occupied by high-mannose-type glycoforms containing five to nine mannose residues. Mannosidase activity was produced only by some members of the mitis group (Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus cristatus, Streptococcus infantis, Streptococcus parasanguinis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae) and Streptococcus intermedius of the anginosus group. None of the other species within the salivarius and mutans groups or Streptococcus peroris and Streptococcus sanguinis produced mannosidase activity. Using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, it was demonstrated that the Man(5) glycan alone was degraded while Man(6) to Man(9), which contain terminal alpha(1-->2) mannose residues in addition to the alpha(1-->3), alpha(1-->6), and beta(1-->4) residues present in Man(5), remained intact. Investigations on mannosidase production using synthetic (4-methylumbelliferone- or p-nitrophenol-linked) alpha- or beta-mannosides as substrates indicated that there was no correlation between degradation of these substrates and degradation of the Man(5) glycan of RNase B. No species degraded these alpha-linked mannosides, while degradation of the beta-linked synthetic substrates was restricted to strains within the Streptococcus anginosus, S. gordonii, and S. intermedius species. The data generated using a native glycoprotein as the substrate demonstrate that mannosidase production within the viridans group streptococci is more widely distributed than had previously been considered.
TI  - Addition of antibacterial agents to MMA-TBB dentin bonding systems--influence on  tensile bond strength and antibacterial effect.
AB  - To produce a bonding system which has both high bond strength and antibacterial properties, an antibacterial agent (vancomycin: VCM or metronidazol: MN) was added to the PMMA powder of 4-META/MMA-TBB resin (CB). The influence of the addition of an antibacterial agent on tensile bond strength to dentin and the antibacterial effect were investigated in this study. Forty-seven freshly extracted bovine first or second incisors were used to measure the tensile bond strength to dentin. The bond strengths to bovine dentin were not significantly decreased by addition of VCM (1%, 2%, 5%), or MN (1%) to CB (p < 0.05). The antibacterial effect of CB containing antibacterial agent on six strains of bacteria was investigated by the agar plate diffusion method, analyzing the appearance of the inhibition zone around a resin disk following anaerobic culturing. The resin disks containing VCM showed antibacterial effects on all of the strains examined; the widths of the inhibition zones were 4-15 mm. The resin disks containing MN showed antibacterial effects on three strains; the widths of the inhibition zones were 0-4 mm. It was thus possible to produce a bonding system with both antibacterial effect and high tensile bond strength by addition of VCM to PMMA powder.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of histidine-rich polypeptides in human parotid saliva].
AB  - Two ultrasensitive antibacterial assays were applied to determine the antibacterial activity of histidine-rich polypeptides (HRPs) in human parotid saliva. The results not only confirmed the potent antibacterial activity of HRPs against Streptococcus mutans MT6R, but also showed for the first time that HRPs were effectively antibacterial to Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ML-35p and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853. Among HRPs, HRP3, HRP5 and HRP6 were the major antibacterial components which were active against S. mutans, S. aureus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa, whereas HRP1 was only effective against E. coli. S. sanguis was resistant to the action of HRPs. These results suggest that HRPs are actually a family of endogenous antibiotic peptides with broad antimicrobial spectrum including fungi, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and may play an important role in the prevention of various infection diseases in the oral cavity as well as in the resistance to caries.
TI  - [Effects of sodium doecyl sulfate on the artificial dental plaque in chemostat].
AB  - Sodium doecyl sulfate (SDS) is widely used as a detergent in dentifrices. It has  been shown to interfere with the protein adsorption to hydroxyapatite (HA), and inhibit acquired pellicle formation. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of SDS on the artificial dental plaque in chemostat. The amount of the 3H-labelled bacteria adhered on the enamel fragment surface was determined with scintillometer. The artificial dental plaque was observed under the scanning electron microscope. The results showed that enamel fragments treated with SDS adsorbed less bacteria than untreated ones, and had no plague formed. It suggested that SDS can inhibit the bacterial adherence on enamel surface and thus reduce dental plaque formation.
TI  - [The effect of chlorhexidine varnish system on Streptococcus mutans in fissure plaques].
AB  - A chlorhexidine varnish system and a controlled releasing varnish were prepared by the authors. The release rate of chlorhexidine in vitro and the effects on S. mutans and S. sanguis in vivo were determined. The results showed that the system could selectively inhibit the growth of S. mutans in fissure plaque and had no effect on S. sanguis. The period of interaction between the layer of varnish and plaque was prolonged by the control-releasing reagent. The study suggests that the chlorhexidine varnish system is effective of anticaries and can maintain microflora balance in oral bacteria.
TI  - Utilization and acid production of beta-galactosyllactose by oral streptococci and human dental plaque.
AB  - Beta-galactosyllactose is a trisaccharide containing the beta-galactosidic linkage at the nonreducing end. The purpose of this study was to determine whether certain oral streptococci could utilize four kinds of beta-galactosyllactoses. Three of four beta-galactosyllactoses were unable to support growth of the oral streptococci and to be a substrate for producing acid from the cell suspensions and dental plaque. 4'-beta-Galactosyllactose supported growth of Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 35105, ATCC 49298, Streptococcus mitis ATCC 15914, Streptococcus oralis ATCC 35037, ATCC 10557 and Streptococcus milleri 10707 and produced acid from dental plaque. Although beta-galactosidase activities were observed in all the strains, 4'-beta-galactosyllactose could not be used as a carbon source for the growth of mutans streptococci. Enzymes metabolizing 4'-beta-galactosyllactose were induced when S. oralis ATCC 10557 was cultured in medium containing galactose. These results suggested that 4'-beta-galactosyllactose could be as cariogenic as lactose if it is consumed frequently and retained for a long period in the mouth.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria from healthy oral cavity of Thai volunteers: inhibition of oral pathogens.
AB  - The aims of the present study were to screen and characterize the antimicrobial lactic acid bacteria which were isolated from healthy oral cavities of Thai volunteers, and to characterize their inhibiting substances. Among 3790 isolates (suspected to be lactic acid bacteria) from 130 volunteers, five showed an appreciable effect against Sarcina lutea ATCC 9341, Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Streptococcus mutans DTMU 1, Strep. salivarius DTMU 1, Strep. sanguis DTMU 1, Candida albicans ATCC 13803 and C. albicans DTMU 2, as well as the oral pathogens. These antimicrobial isolates included L17 and N14 which showed the antibacterial activity, D14 which showed the anticandidal activity, and D6 and N8 which showed both the antibacterial and anticandidal activities. The isolates were later found to be facultative anaerobic, Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, non-capsule-forming and catalase-negative bacilli. They could utilize casein but could not hydrolyse starch, and they produced hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocins. Their antimicrobial potentials were found to be affected by pH, catalase, proteolytic enzymes and temperature. The activity was partially inactivated after catalase treatment, significantly declined at pH > or =9.0 or after trypsin and pepsin treatments, and also reduced after heating at > or =100 degrees C. However, the antimicrobial activity of these five isolates was somewhat resistant to heat. When the isolates were tested for their antimicrobial sensitivity, they were shown to be sensitive to a number of antimicrobial agents. The final identification revealed that D6, D14 and N14 were Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, and L17 and N8 were Lact. rhamnosus.
TI  - Post-pH effect in oral streptococci.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the post-pH effect (PpHE) in 11 strains of oral streptococci belonging to Streptococcus sanguis, S. mitis, S. gordonii, S. mutans and S. sobrinus by using the BacT/Alert microbial detection system. METHODS: The bacterial cultures were exposed to a different pH (3.6, 4.0, 4.6, 5.0, 5.6, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0 and 8.6) for 1 h, and then returned to a neutral medium. The automated BacT/Alert system determined resumed microbial growth by measuring CO2 generation. The PpHE expresses the time difference between resumed growth (after pH shock) and optimal growth (pH 7.0 used as the control). RESULTS: PpHE was found to be minimal for alkaline pH values, and to be strain and species dependent. CONCLUSIONS: The PpHE may be useful as an ecological determinant or as an indicator of the cariogenicity of oral streptococci.
TI  - Properties of Streptococcus sanguinis glucans formed under various conditions.
AB  - The aim of our study was to determine whether the structure of glucans formed by  glucosyltransferase from Streptococcus sanguinis (GtfSs) on a surface differ from those formed in solution and to explore the effects of antiserum to Gtfs, control normal rabbit serum, starch hydrolysates (STH) and dextran on S. sanguinis (GtfSs) glucan. Linkage analyses showed that solution-formed glucans are predominantly alpha-1,6-linked and have a small amount of alpha-1,3-linked glucose. Surface-formed glucans have enhanced susceptibility to mutanase. Solution- and surface-formed glucans made in the presence or absence of sera, STH, and dextran contain linkages which differ in both amount and type from control glucans. The GtfSs enzyme in solution exposed to antiserum behaves as if it is adsorbed to a surface. Binding of Streptococcus mutans GS-5 and Actinomyces viscosus OMZ105E (Ny1) to S. sanguinis glucan differs if the glucan is formed in the presence of antiserum. The information could help to define the role of glucans in the formation of pellicle, colonization of tooth surfaces and the accumulation of dental plaque.
TI  - Strain-related acid production by oral streptococci.
AB  - Acid production, in particular at low pH, is thought to be an important ecological determinant in dental caries. The aim of the present study was to determine the acid producing capability at different pH levels of 47 streptococcal strains, representing 9 species, isolated from human dental plaque. The bacteria were grown until mid log-phase under anaerobic conditions and acid production was measured in a pH-stat system at pH 7.0, 6.0, 5.5 and 5.0. At all pH values, the mean velocity of acid production (V(ap)) by Streptococcus mutans and S. sobrinus was significantly higher (p<0.01; ANOVA) than that of the other oral streptococci, including S. mitis, S. oralis, S. gordonii, S. sanguis, S. intermedius, S. anginosus, S. constellatus, and S. vestibularis. However, the V(ap) of some strains of S. mitis biovar 1 and S. oralis, particularly at pH values of 7.0 and 6.0, exceeded that of some strains of S. mutans. The V(ap) decreased with pH for all strains, but some strains of S. mitis biovar 1 and strains of the mutans streptococci maintained a relatively high rate of acid production. The results suggest that some strains of S. mitis biovar 1 and S. oralis may play an important role in caries development by modifying the environment in dental plaque to become favourable for the succession of aciduric species. The study furthermore emphasises the need for detailed species and biovar identification of oral streptococci and for recognition of the significant physiological differences that occur within single species.
TI  - Similarity of bacteriocin activity profiles of mutans streptococci within the family when the children acquire the strains after the age of 5.
AB  - It has been shown that there is a window of infectivity for mutans streptococci between the ages of 19 and 31 months, when many children acquire mutans streptococci transmitted from their mothers. Part of the children that escape this window acquire mutans streptococci at a later age. In this group, maternal transmission is expected to be less prevalent. The present study compared the bacteriocin activity profiles of mutans streptococci isolated from mothers, fathers and children when the children acquired the mutans streptococci between the ages of 5 and 11. Twelve families were randomly selected from a group of 11-year-old children who were known to have acquired mutans streptococci during this age period. From the saliva of the mothers (n = 12), fathers (n = 8) and children (n = 12) approximately 30 mutans streptococci strains were isolated. All isolates were tested twice for bacteriocin activity against 21 indicator strains with a double-layer technique. Bacteriocin activity of strains was considered to be different when the number of strains against which bacteriocin was produced differed >1 or when the width of one or more inhibition zones differed > or =4 mm. In 7/12 mother-child pairs similar profiles were found. In the 8 father-child pairs similar profiles were only found on 2 occasions. In these 2 families, all 3 ( mother, father and child) harboured strains with a similar profile. In 4/8 father-mother pairs similar profiles were found. There was no correlation between the prevalence of mutans streptococci strains, the number of indicator strains against which the strains made bacteriocin, nor the mean size of the inhibition zones and the presence of similarity of bacteriocin activity profiles of mutans streptococci within the family members. The results show that even when a child acquires mutans streptococci after the age of 5, there may be similarity between mutans streptococci in mother, father and child, indicating that transmission between the family members occurs.
TI  - Fractional inhibitory concentration index of combinations of antibacterial agents against cariogenic organisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the inhibitory effects between paired combinations of four antibacterial agents that have been investigated in dentistry against six bacteria associated with dentinal caries. METHODS: The antibacterial agents tested were: chlorhexidine dihydrochloride, benzalkonium chloride, cetrimide and cetylpyridinium chloride. Two organisms each belonging to Streptococcus, Lactobacillus and Actinomyces species were evaluated against these agents. A checkerboard microtitration method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration and fractionary inhibitory concentration (FIC) and summation operator FIC index of the paired combinations of antibacterial agents against the six species of bacteria. Appropriate controls were included. The summation operator FIC index was then used to determine if synergy, antagonism, or indifference occurred as a result of interactions between the antibacterial agents and the test organisms. RESULTS: The data from a total of 295 test results were evaluated. Using summation operator FIC values for synergy as < or = 0.5 and antagonism as > 4.0 as recommended by The American Society for Microbiology, no significant synergistic or antagonistic interactions were observed between the paired antibacterial agents when tested against selected organisms. However, a tendency for an additive antibacterial effect was observed with approximately a third of the test results. Nonetheless, no combination of antibacterial agents appeared to be superior to any other. CONCLUSIONS: According to these in vitro results, there appears to be no beneficial effect of combining the antibacterial agents against the individual cariogenic micro-organisms selected. However, it may be beneficial to use combined antibacterial agents that have a broader range of activity against an ecosystem of bacteria than using individual agents.
TI  - Effects of antibodies to glucosyltransferase on soluble and insolubilized enzymes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have shown that glucosyltransferase enzymes (Gtfs) of Streptococcus mutans adsorbed to saliva coated hydroxyapatite (sHA) have distinct properties from the same enzymes in solution. The purpose of the present study was to determine the effects on enzyme activity of polyclonal antibodies raised to Gtfs in a soluble form and bound to sHA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antiserum was raised in six New Zealand White rabbits using the purified glucosyltransferase enzymes (Gtfs) of S. mutans, GtfB, GtfC, or GtfD as soluble antigens or adsorbed to hydroxyapatite (HA, insolubilized). The antisera were examined for their ability to react to these Gtfs and Gtf from Streptococcus sanguis (GtfSs) in Western blot formats as well as inhibit enzyme activity in solution and insolubilized. RESULTS: Antibodies raised against GtfB or GtfC detected all Gtf enzymes examined in Western blots; antibodies raised to GtfD reacted strongly to GtfD and GtfSs, poorly to GtfC, and was non-reactive with GtfB. Antibodies to GtfB or GtfC inhibited activity of GtfB and GtfC in solution by 90% or more. Enzyme activity adsorbed to sHA was inhibited from 70% to 80% by the same antisera. These same antibodies possessed no specific effect on the activities of either GtfD or GtfSs. Antibodies raised to the GtfD enzyme inhibited activity of GtfD (80% to 90% inhibition) and GtfSs activity (50% to 80%) in solution. In contrast the GtfD antibodies had no effect on the activity of either GtfB or GtfC enzymes in solution. Modest inhibitory effects were noted on GtfC and GtfSs enzymes bound to sHA, but no inhibition was observed for sHA-bound GtfB or GtfD. CONCLUSION: These data show that some antibodies effective against enzymes in solution may have significantly lesser inhibitory effects against the same enzymes insolubilized. Further, presentation of Gtf antigen immobilized to HA has only a minor influence on the production of antibodies inhibitory to Gtf activity.
TI  - Adaptation of oral streptococci to low pH.
AB  - The strategies employed by oral streptococci to resist the inimical influences of acidification reflect the diverse and dynamic niches of the human mouth. All of the oral streptococci are capable of rapid degradation of sugar to acidic end-products. As a result, the pH value of their immediate environment can plummet to levels where glycolysis and growth cease. At this point, the approaches for survival in acid separate the organisms. Streptococcus mutans, for example, relies on its F-ATPase, to protect itself from acidification by pumping protons out of the cells. S. salivarius responds by degrading urea to ammonia and S. sanguis produces ammonia by arginolysis. The mechanisms by which these organisms regulate their particular escape route are now being explored experimentally. The picture that emerges is that the acid-adaptive regulatory mechanisms of the oral streptococci differ markedly from those employed by Gram-negative bacteria. What remains to be elucidated are the breadth of the acid-response systems in these organisms and how they permit the microbes to sustain themselves in the face of low pH and the bacterial competition present in their respective niches. In this article, we summarize reports concerning the means by which oral streptococci either utilize acidification to subdue their competitors or protect themselves until pH values return to a more favorable level.
TI  - Studies concerning the glucosyltransferase of Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - We have shown in previous studies that the glucosyltransferase (Gtf) enzymes of Streptococcus mutans have distinct properties when adsorbed to a surface. In the present study, we compared the activity of Gtf from Streptococcus sanguis, designated GtfSs, in solution and on the surface of saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sHA) beads, and determined the ability of its product glucan to support the adherence of oral microorganisms. Gtf from S. sanguis 804 NCTC 10904 was purified from culture supernatant fluids by means of hydroxyapatite chromatography. Enzyme and the substrate were prepared in buffers at pH values from 3.5 to 7.5. Maximum activity of GtfSs occurred between pH 5.5 and pH 6.5, whether in solution or adsorbed onto a surface. The solubilized and insolubilized enzymes showed highest activity at 40 degrees C; activity was reduced by 50(+/-2)% at 20 and 30 degrees C. The enzyme did not form glucans in either phase at 10 or 60 degrees C. The K(m), determined from Lineweaver-Burk plots, for the enzyme in solution was 4.3(+/-0.4) mmol/l sucrose, and the K(m) for the enzyme on sHA beads was 5.0(+/-1.0) mmol/l sucrose. The ability of the GtfSs glucan synthesized on the surface of sHA beads to support the adherence of oral bacteria was investigated. (3)H-thymidine-labeled bacteria (S. mutans GS-5, S. sobrinus 6715, S. sobrinus 6716, S. sanguis 10904, Actinomyces viscosus OMZ105E, A. viscosus 2085, and A. viscosus 2086) were incubated with sHA beads coated with GtfSs glucan. S. mutans GS-5 displayed the highest level of binding numerically. These results show that the GtfSs of S. sanguis is active on sHA beads, that the pH optimum for activity on a surface differs slightly from that in solution, and that its product glucan can support the adherence of oral microorganisms.
TI  - Natural history of Streptococcus sanguinis in the oral cavity of infants: evidence for a discrete window of infectivity.
AB  - The heterogeneous group of oral bacteria within the sanguinis (sanguis) streptococci comprise members of the indigenous biota of the human oral cavity. While the association of Streptococcus sanguinis with bacterial endocarditis is well described in the literature, S. sanguinis is thought to play a benign, if not a beneficial, role in the oral cavity. Little is known, however, about the natural history of S. sanguinis and its specific relationship with other oral bacteria. As part of a longitudinal study concerning the transmission and acquisition of oral bacteria within mother-infant pairs, we examined the initial acquisition of S. sanguinis and described its colonization relative to tooth emergence and its proportions in plaque and saliva as a function of other biological events, including subsequent colonization with mutans streptococci. A second cohort of infants was recruited to define the taxonomic affiliation of S. sanguinis. We found that the colonization of the S. sanguinis occurs during a discrete "window of infectivity" at a median age of 9 months in the infants. Its colonization is tooth dependent and correlated to the time of tooth emergence; its proportions in saliva increase as new teeth emerge. In addition, early colonization of S. sanguinis and its elevated levels in the oral cavity were correlated to a significant delay in the colonization of mutans streptococci. Underpinning this apparent antagonism between S. sanguinis and mutans streptococci is the observation that after mutans streptococci colonize the infant, the levels of S. sanguinis decrease. Children who do not harbor detectable levels of mutans streptococci have significantly higher levels of S. sanguinis in their saliva than do children colonized with mutans streptococci. Collectively, these findings suggest that the colonization of S. sanguinis may influence the subsequent colonization of mutans streptococci, and this in turn may suggest several ecological approaches toward controlling dental caries.
TI  - Purification, characterization, and molecular analysis of the gene encoding glucosyltransferase from Streptococcus oralis.
AB  - Streptococcus oralis is a member of the oral streptococcal family and an early-colonizing microorganism in the oral cavity of humans. S. oralis is known to produce glucosyltransferase (GTase), which synthesizes glucans from sucrose. The enzyme was purified chromatographically from a culture supernatant of S. oralis ATCC 10557. The purified enzyme, GTase-R, had a molecular mass of 173 kDa and a pI of 6.3. This enzyme mainly synthesized water-soluble glucans with no primer dependency. The addition of GTase markedly enhanced the sucrose-dependent resting cell adhesion of Streptococcus mutans at a level similar to that found in growing cells of S. mutans. The antibody against GTase-R inhibited the glucan-synthesizing activities of Streptococcus gordonii and Streptococcus sanguis, as well as S. oralis. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of GTase-R exhibited no similarities to known GTase sequences of oral streptococci. Using degenerate PCR primers, an 8.1-kb DNA fragment, carrying the gene (gtfR) coding for GTase-R and its regulator gene (rgg), was cloned and sequenced. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence revealed that the rgg genes of S. oralis and S. gordonii exhibited a close similarity. The gtfR gene was found to possess a species-specific nucleotide sequence corresponding to the N-terminal 130 amino acid residues. Insertion of erm or aphA into the rgg or gtfR gene resulted in decreased GTase activity by the organism and changed the colony morphology of these transformants. These results indicate that S. oralis GTase may play an important role in the subsequent colonizing of mutans streptoccoci.
TI  - Namibian chewing stick, Diospyros lycioides, contains antibacterial compounds against oral pathogens.
AB  - The twigs of Diospyros lycioides, a plant commonly known as "muthala", are frequently used as chewing sticks for the cleaning of teeth by rural and urban people in Namibia. Preliminary studies showed that a methanol extract of D. lycioides inhibited growth of selected oral pathogens. Subsequent bioassay-guided fractionation led to the isolation of four novel bioactive naphthalene glycosides, diospyrosides A, B, C, and D (1-4), and two known bioactive naphthoquinones, juglone (5) and 7-methyljuglone (6). The structures of the new compounds were elucidated using spectroscopic techniques including 1D and 2D NMR. These compounds inhibited the growth of oral cariogenic bacteria (Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis) and periodontal pathogens (Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia) at minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.019 to 1.25 mg/mL. Juglone exhibited the strongest inhibitory activity among these compounds.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis and Arnica montana against oral pathogens.
AB  - Arnica and propolis have been used for thousands of years in folk medicine for several purposes. They possess several biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antiviral and tissue regenerative, among others. Although the antibacterial activity of propolis has already been demonstrated, very few studies have been done on bacteria of clinical relevance in dentistry. Also, the antimicrobial activity of Arnica has not been extensively investigated. Therefore the aim here was to evaluate in vitro the antimicrobial activity, inhibition of adherence of mutans streptococci and inhibition of formation of water-insoluble glucan by Arnica and propolis extracts. Arnica montana (10%, w/v) and propolis (10%, w/v) extracts from Minas Gerais State were compared with controls. Fifteen microorganisms were used as follows: Candida albicans--NTCC 3736, F72; Staphylococcus aureus--ATCC 25923; Enterococcus faecalis--ATCC 29212; Streptococcus sobrinus 6715; Strep. sanguis--ATCC 10556; Strep. cricetus--HS-6; Strep. mutans--Ingbritt 1600; Strep. mutans--OMZ 175; Actinomyces naeslundii--ATCC 12104, W 1053; Act. viscosus OMZ 105; Porphyromonas gingivalis; Porph. endodontalis and Prevotella denticola (the last three were clinical isolates). Antimicrobial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. To assess cell adherence to a glass surface, the organisms were grown for 18 h at 37 degrees C in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. To assay water-insoluble glucan formation, a mixture of crude glucosyltransferase and 0.125 M sucrose was incubated for 18 h at 37 degrees C in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. Arnica and propolis extracts (20 microl) were added to these tubes to evaluate the % of inhibition of cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation. The propolis extract significantly inhibited all the microorganisms tested (p < 0.05), showing the largest inhibitory zone for Actinomyces spp. The Arnica extract did not demonstrate significant antimicrobial activity. Cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation were almost completely inhibited by the propolis extract at a final concentration of 400 microg/ml and 500 microg/ml, respectively. The Arnica extract showed slight inhibition of the adherence of the growing cells (19% for Strep. mutans and 15% for Strep. sobrinus) and of water-insoluble glucan formation (29%) at these same concentrations. Thus, the propolis extract showed in vitro antibacterial activity, inhibition of cell adherence and inhibition of water-insoluble glucan formation, while the Arnica extract was only slightly active in those three conditions.
TI  - Epithelial cell response to challenge of bacterial lipoteichoic acids and lipopolysaccharides in vitro.
AB  - Accumulating dental plaque at the gingival margin contains lipoteichoic acids (LTAs) from the cell walls of gram-positive bacteria. In subgingival plaque associated with periodontal disease the amount of lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) from gram-negative bacteria increases. As the gingival junctional epithelium (JE) is an important structural and functional tissue, participating in the first line defence against apical advancement of dental plaque, this study examined the direct effects of LTAs (from Streptococcus mutans and S. sanguis) and LPSs (from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola and Escherichia coli) on two epithelial cell lines (HaCaT and ERM) and a culture model for human JE. The cells were exposed to the LTAs or LPSs (10-50 microg/ml) for variable periods of time. None of the bacterial surface components had any effect on primary adhesion or on the epithelial attachment of the JE cultures. However, cell growth and mitotic activity were consistently reduced in all cultures treated with LTAs. In contrast, LPSs showed only slight or no effects on cell growth and mitotic activity depending on the epithelial cells used. This suggests that LPSs, despite their established role as modulators of inflammation, do not have direct harmful effects - at the concentrations found in dental plaque and gingival crevicular fluid - which would explain the mechanism of epithelial degeneration and detachment from the tooth surface. However, the LTAs appear to inhibit the renewal of epithelium and may thus contribute to degeneration of coronal JE and subgingival colonisation by periodontal pathogens.
TI  - The in vitro effects of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate on oral and pharyngeal microorganisms of various ecological niches.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the in vitro susceptibility to cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate for various aerobic and anaerobic micro-organisms responsible for oral and pharyngeal diseases by assessing the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) or minimum fungicidal concentrations (MFCs) and by determining kill-times. The MICs of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate for 46 tested strains (25 reference strains and 21 clinical isolates) ranged from 8 to 500 micrograms/ml. The MIC was found to be 31.25 micrograms/ml for 36% of the reference strains. Even lower MIC values (15.63 micrograms/ml) were observed for some anaerobic strains, for Haemophilus influenzae and for Candida tropicalis. MIC and MBC values corresponded for the majority of strains tested while the MFC for C. tropicalis and C. albicans was much higher. Only 9.5% of the clinical isolates gave a MIC value of 31.25 micrograms/ml. Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus showed MIC at 62.5 micrograms/ml. The MIC and MBC values among the isolates were comparable, while the MFC value for the yeasts was greater. A concentration of 125 micrograms/ml of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate inhibited the growth of all bacteria, except Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonaceae, and yeasts. Cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate shows very rapid kill-time for S. sanguis (0"), and rapid (15") for S. pyogenes, S. dysgalactiae and S. mutans and for Moraxella catarrhalis, while a longer kill-time was necessary for the other microbes tested.
TI  - Effects of organic acid anions on growth, glycolysis, and intracellular pH of oral streptococci.
AB  - Oral streptococci produce large quantities of organic acids as the end-products of carbohydrate fermentation. In an approach to determine if oral streptococci exhibit differential sensitivities to organic acid anions, we determined the effects of formate, lactate, and acetate on intracellular pH maintenance, glycolysis, and growth of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis. Growth was determined as maximum culture optical density in the presence of the organic acid anions at pH 7.1, 6.7, 6.3, and 6.1, and the effects of the anions on glycolytic activity and intracellular pH were determined at pH 7.0 and 5.0. At pH 7.1, the organic acid anions had little effect on growth of either species. At the lower pH values, all of the anions reduced the maximum culture optical density of both species in a pH- and concentration-dependent manner, with S. sanguis being more sensitive to growth inhibition than S. mutans. The organic acid anions had little or no effect on glycolytic activity of either species at pH 7.0. However, all of the organic acid anions tested reduced glycolytic activity at pH 5.0 in a concentration-dependent manner, with S. sanguis being more sensitive than S. mutans. The inhibition of glycolysis could be related to the pKa of the organic acid, with formate and lactate being more inhibitory than acetate. The organic acid anions decreased the intracellular pH of S. mutans and S. sanguis, glycolyzing at an extracellular pH of 5.0, such that the reduction in glycolytic activity caused by the organic acid anions could be directly attributed to the fall in intracellular pH. In conclusion, the production of lactic acid in plaque would not only lower pH, thereby having a disadvantageous effect on less aciduric oral streptococci, such as S. sanguis, but would also increase their sensitivity to the effects of low pH, helping S. mutans to become more dominant.
TI  - Factors which are associated with dental decay in the older individual.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To improve reliability of salivary bacterial cultures as a surrogate  for plaque levels of cariogenic bacterial species by reporting the salivary CFUs of these organisms as a function of the number of teeth. DESIGN: Cross-sectional collection of data in a convenience sample of adults over 60 years of age. SETTING: Hospital Dental clinic, University bacteriology laboratory. SUBJECTS: 523 older dentate subjects, average age 70, including 412 subjects who were in an independent living status and 111 in a dependent-living situation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Subjects were examined for decay and the presence of salivary factors including the levels of S. mutans, lactobacilli, yeast and other bacteria. The salivary levels of the bacteria were adjusted for the number of teeth in the mouth, and the resultant values were entered into multivariable logistic regression models along with clinical and other salivary parameters. RESULTS: Mutans streptococci levels reported as CFUs/ml saliva per tooth were significantly associated with coronal surface decay, and lactobacilli, reported in a similar way, were significantly associated with root surface decay. Salivary levels of yeasts, which had previously been associated with decay in this population, were no longer significant using this construct. CONCLUSIONS: This construct of reporting salivary bacteriological data as a function of tooth number and per ml saliva could improve the reliability of bacteriological data obtained in epidemiological studies investigating the role of bacteria in dental decay in the elderly.
TI  - Synthesis, microbicidal activity, and solution structure of the dodecapeptide from bovine neutrophils.
AB  - The dodecapepetide sequence R-L-C-R-I-V-V-I-R-V-C-R with a disulfide bridge between the cysteine residues found in bovine neutrophils was synthesized by solid-phase procedures. Its antimicrobial activity against oral microorganisms such as Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus gordonii was examined, and its structural features were examined by CD and determined by two-dimensional (2D) nmr. The strains P. gingivalis (W50 and 381), A. actinomycetemcomitans (Y4 and 67), S. gordonii (DL1), and S. mutans (GS5) are found to be highly sensitive to this peptide at 2-2.5 microM concentrations, suggesting that the dodecapeptide is a potent antibiotic for oral pathogens. The weak negative n-sigma* band observed at approximately 265-270 nm in the CD spectra of this peptide provides evidence for the presence of a disulfide bridge. The negative n-pi* band at approximately 200 nm and the positive pi-pi* band at 185 nm suggest a folded structure for this peptide. The negative n-pi* shifts from 200 to 206 nm with an increase in intensity in dipalmitoylphosphotidylcholine vesicles, suggesting that the peptide might associate to form higher order aggregates in lipid medium. The assignment of backbone and side-chain proton resonances has been accomplished by the combined analysis of 2D total correlated and nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy. The temperature dependence of amide NH chemical shifts and (1)H-(2)H exchange effect on amide NH resonances indicate the involvement of amide NH groups of Cys3, Ile5, Ile8, Val10, and Arg12 in intramolecular hydrogen bonding. The coupling constant (J(NH-C(alpha)H)) values, the set of medium-, short-, and long-range nuclear Overhauser effects, and the results of restrained structure calculation using the distance geometry algorithm for nmr applications provide evidence for a folded, loop-like structure with a type I (III) beta-turn involving Ile5, Val6, Val7, and Ile8, and two antiparallel beta-strands involving the N-terminal Arg1, Leu2, Cys3, and Val4 and the C-terminal Arg9, Val10, Cys11, and Arg12 residues. The structure of the dodecapeptide mimics the amphiphilic structure of large 30-35 residue defensins and the peptide appears to exhibit similar antimicrobial potency.
TI  - Periodontal findings and systemic antibody responses to oral microorganisms in Behcet's disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Behcet's disease is a multisystem disorder of unknown etiology, affecting predominantly the oral mucosa, skin, and eyes. Recurrent and painful episodes of oral ulcerations interfere with regular oral hygiene leading to rapid bacterial plaque accumulation. The aims of this study were to evaluate the periodontal status of patients with Behcet's disease and determine serum antibody responses to selected oral microorganisms, including major periodontopathogens in these patients. METHODS: Thirty-three patients with Behcet's disease and 15 healthy subjects were included in the study. Plaque, sulcular bleeding, periodontal index scores, probing depths, and total number of teeth were recorded. Serum IgG antibody levels to a panel of 13 oral microorganisms were determined. RESULTS: Significantly higher values for each of the clinical measures were observed in patients with Behcet's disease compared to healthy subjects (P <0.0001). Antibody levels to selected members of plaque, including Actinomyces viscosus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus oralis, Eikenella corrodens, Campylobacter rectus, and Prevotella intermedia were significantly lower in patients with Behcet's disease than in controls (P <0.001-0.05). In contrast, these patients exhibited significantly elevated antibody levels to Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Y4 compared to controls (P <0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that the patients with Behcet's disease generally exhibit clinical findings of established periodontal disease. Decreased antibody responses to early colonizers of both supra- and subgingival plaque were observed along with the elevation in antibody levels to A. actinomycetemcomitans. These results suggest that the bacterial plaque ecology and/or immune responses to these microorganisms may be affected in Behcet's disease which could lead to changes in the expression of periodontal disease.
TI  - Prevalence of the amylase-binding protein A gene (abpA) in oral streptococci.
AB  - Salivary amylase binds specifically to a number of oral streptococcal species. This interaction may play an important role in dental plaque formation. Recently, a 585-bp gene was cloned and sequenced from Streptococcus gordonii Challis encoding a 20.5-kDa amylase-binding protein (AbpA). The goal of this study was to determine if related genes are present in other species of oral streptococci. Biotinylated abpA was used in Southern blot analysis to screen genomic DNA from several strains representing eight species of oral streptococci. This probe hybridized with a 4.0-kb HindIII restriction fragment from all 13 strains of S. gordonii tested. The probe did not appear to bind to any restriction fragments from other species of amylase-binding oral streptococci including Streptococcus mitis (with the exception of 1 of 14 strains), Streptococcus crista (3 strains), Streptococcus anginosus (1 strain), and Streptococcus parasanguinis (1 strain), or to non-amylase-binding oral streptococci including Streptococcus sanguinis (3 strains), Streptococcus oralis (4 strains), and Streptococcus mutans (1 strain). Primers homologous to sequences within the 3' and 5' ends of abpA yielded products of 400 bp following PCR of genomic DNA from the Southern blot-positive strains. Several of these PCR products were cloned and sequenced. The levels of similarity of these cloned products to the abpA of S. gordonii Challis ranged from 91 to 96%. These studies reveal that the abpA gene appears to be specific to S. gordonii and differs from genes encoding amylase-binding proteins from other species of amylase-binding streptococci.
TI  - Reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic measurement of the P-aminobenzoic acid synthesized by Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the biosynthesis of P-aminobenzoic acid by Streptococcus sanguis and the role of P-aminobenzoic acid in the interaction between Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mutans. METHODS: A reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic technique was used to analyze the P-aminobenzoic acid synthesized by Streptococcus sanguis in an anaerobic atmosphere. RESULTS: The results showed, that (1) the chromatographic method established in this study had good linear relation and the average recovery of P-aminobenzoic acid was 80%, and (2) Streptococcus sanguis did synthesize P-aminobenzoic acid, and the mean concentration of P-aminobenzoic acid was 1.23 micrograms/mL. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study will help further studies of the factors that may have effects on P-aminobenzoic acid synthesis by Streptococcus sanguis and on the role of P-aminobenzoic acid in the microbial homeostasis of dental plaque.
TI  - Identification of clinically relevant viridans streptococci by analysis of transfer DNA intergenic spacer length polymorphism.
AB  - The utility of PCR analysis of transfer DNA intergenic spacer length polymorphism (tDNA-ILP) for the identification to the species level of clinically relevant viridans streptococci was evaluated with a collection of reference strains of 15 species of the salivarius, anginosus, mitis and mutans rRNA homology groups. PCR products generated by using fluorescent, outwardly directed, consensus tDNA primers were analysed by electrophoresis on denaturating polyacrylamide gels and by laser fluorescence scanning. Eleven species showed specific and distinct tDNA patterns: Streptococcus cristatus, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus parasanguinis, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus criceti and Streptococcus ratti. Indistinguishable patterns were obtained among two groups of species: Streptococcus vestibularis and Streptococcus salivarius on the one hand and Streptococcus constellatus and Streptococcus intermedius on the other. S. mitis strains produced heterogeneous patterns that could be separated into three groups: a group containing S. mitis biovar 1 and two S. mitis biovar 2 groups, one of which clustered with S. parasanguinis strains while the other showed patterns unrelated to other species. These results agree in part with protein electrophoretic analysis showing that S. mitis biovar 2 strains belong to several streptococcal taxa. In conclusion, PCR analysis of tDNA-ILP holds promise for rapid identification of viridans streptococci that are difficult to identify by phenotypic tests.
TI  - An evaluation of the action of different root canal irrigants on facultative aerobic-anaerobic, obligate anaerobic, and microaerophilic bacteria.
AB  - The aim of this study was to test the effect of different concentrations of sodium hypochlorite, chlorhexidine, and cetrimide on the following bacterial strains: Facultative aerobes-anaerobes: Candida albicans ATCC 10231; Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212; Escherichia coli ATCC 25,922; Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27,853; Streptococcus mitis ATCC 9811; Streptococcus mutans ATCC 35668; Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 13419; and Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556. Microaerophiles: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 29522. Obligate anaerobes: Actinomyces odontolyticus ATCC 17929; Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25,586; Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277; and Prevotella melaninogenica ATCC 25845. Each irrigant was kept in contact with the bacterial species used for the experiment for 10, 20, or 30 min. Results showed that all irrigants had a bactericidal effect on both facultative aerobes-anaerobes and on microaerophilic and obligate anaerobic strains, in all concentrations and even after short periods of contact.
TI  - Inhibitory effects of oolong tea extract on caries-inducing properties of mutans  streptococci.
AB  - The inhibitory effects of oolong tea extract (OTE) on the caries-inducing properties of mutans streptococci were examined in vitro. OTE reduced the rate of acid production by mutans streptococci accompanied with the retardation of growth rate of mutans streptococci, while the action by chromatographically isolated oolong tea polyphenol (OTF6) was weak. On the other hand, both oolong tea products decreased cell surface hydrophobicity of almost all the oral streptococci examined in the present study, and also induced cellular aggregation of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguis or Streptococcus gordonii. In these reactions, OTF6 showed a more pronounced activity than OTE. Furthermore, the oolong tea products inhibited the adherence of mutans streptococci to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite. These results suggest that OTF6 may inhibit bacterial adherence to the tooth surfaces by reducing the hydrophobicity of mutans streptococci, and OTE may inhibit caries-inducing activity of mutans streptococci by reducing the rate of acid production.
TI  - An in vitro investigation of the antimicrobial activity of an herbal mouthrinse.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the antimicrobial activity of one prescription and two commercially available over-the-counter mouthrinses and positive and negative controls against bacteria commonly found in the oral cavity. The bacteria used in this study were Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis and Actinomyces viscosus. Sterile discs which were treated with the mouthrinses were placed on agar plates along with the controls. Zones of microbial inhibition were measured in millimeters after 48 hours. The results indicated that all of the mouthrinses demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the bacteria tested. Herbal Mouth and Gum Therapy mouthrinse, containing natural ingredients, produced the largest zones of microbial inhibition when compared to Listerine against all three of the bacteria tested. Herbal Mouth and Gum Therapy mouthrinse produced larger zones of microbial inhibition when compared to Peridex against two of the three bacteria tested, and produced similar zones of inhibition against the third bacteria.
TI  - Polymicrobial etiology of dental caries.
AB  - The present study was carried out to establish the normal bacterial oral flora and the aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora from deep seated dental caries, and to determine the antimicrobial sensitivity of the clinical isolates so obtained Streptococcus mutans (48%) and Streptococcus sanguis (20%) were the main aerobic isolates whereas Lactobacillus spp. (52%), Veillonella spp. (24%) and Actinomyces spp. (12%) were the major anaerobic isolates. Hundred percent of the samples from dental caries yielded polymicrobial isolates while in two samples from healthy individuals S. mutans was the sole isolate. As the flora changed from healthy tooth to dental caries it changed from one predominated by anaerobic gram-positive cocci to anaerobic gram-positive bacilli. All the anaerobes isolated were sensitive to metronidazole and cefotaxime, whereas all the isolated streptococci were sensitive to penicillin, erythromycin and clindamycin. Incorporation of the antibiotics in baseline restoration, if technically feasible, has been advocated.
TI  - Effect of oleanolic acid-cyclodextrin inclusion compounds on dental caries by in  vitro experiment and rat-caries model.
AB  - Earlier work in vitro showed that oleanolic acid (OA) was a potential inhibitor of insoluble glucan (ISG) synthesis from mutans streptococci (MS). In this study, two oleanolic acid-cyclodextrin inclusion compounds (OA-CDs), oleanolic acid-G1-beta-cyclodextrin (OA-G1-beta CD) and oleanolic acid-beta-cyclodextrin (OA-beta CD), were assayed for their effects on ISG synthesis from Streptococcus mutans MT8148R, and on the growth of oral bacteria. OA-beta CD inhibited ISG synthesis by 55.3 and 37.4% at 62.5 and 15.6 micrograms/ml of OA, respectively. Both OA-CDs inhibited the growth of MS, S. sanguis, and S. salivarius at 4 to 8 micrograms/ml of OA. The anticariogenic effect of the OA-beta CD was examined in a rat-caries model. Rats in the infected control groups showed the highest caries score. The infected treatment group B (0.5% OA in diet) showed lower scores than the control group. These results suggest that OA-beta CD is a potential anti-caries agent.
TI  - The effects of histatin-derived basic antimicrobial peptides on oral biofilms.
AB  - Susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial agents is strongly reduced by the formation of complex biofilms. We investigated whether synthetic histatin analogs with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro were also active against these complex mixtures of bacteria, as present in saliva and plaque. In a simplified model system for dental plaque, hydroxyapatite discs were placed in a continuous culture system comprised of Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, S. salivarius, Actinomyces naeslundii, Veillonella parvula, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Prevotella intermedia. Ex situ treatment of the biofilms formed on these discs with 100 microg/mL of peptide dhvar4 significantly reduced facultative anaerobic, total anaerobic, and obligate anaerobic Gram-negative counts with 0.8, 0.5, and 0.5 log units, respectively. Ex vivo treatment of salivary bacteria gave reductions of 0.4, 0.7, and 1.5 log units, respectively. For ex vivo treatment of plaque bacteria, reductions of 0.4, 0.4, and 1.4 log units, respectively, were found. In both saliva and plaque samples, obligate anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were significantly more susceptible to dhvar4 than facultatively anaerobic or anaerobic bacteria as a whole (p=0.013 and p=0.018, for salivary bacteria, and p=0.021 and p=0.020 for plaque bacteria, respectively). Although the oral bacteria are protected by biofilm formation, the synthetic histatin analog caused a significant reduction of viable counts in a model for oral biofilm as well as in isolated oral biofilms.
TI  - Effects of hydrogen peroxide on growth and selected properties of Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - In this study we first evaluated the effects of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on growth and selected properties of Porphyromonas gingivalis, and compared them with those obtained by a reducing agent (cysteine). The growth of P. gingivalis was only moderately affected when H2O2 was added at concentrations up to 30 mM in a complex culture medium. However, when a defined basal medium was used, H2O2 at a concentration of 3 mM completely inhibited growth of P. gingivalis. Incorporation of cysteine at concentrations up to 30 mM in both media had no effect on growth. The effects of H2O2 and cysteine on cell-associated hemagglutinating and Arg-gingipain activities were evaluated using bacteria grown in the complex culture medium. Both activities were strongly decreased when H2O2 was added in the assay mixtures. This inhibitory effect of H2O2 was reversible. On the other hand, including cysteine in the assay mixtures increased both activities. H2O2 and cysteine had no effect on the expression of heat shock protein (HSP)-68 and HSP-75 by P. gingivalis, as determined by SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblotting analysis. In the second part of the study, we tested whether growth of selected oral bacterial species may modify the oxidation-reduction potential (Eh) of the environment. It was found that certain species were able to either decrease (P. gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, Streptococcus mutans) or increase (Streptococcus sanguis) the Eh of the medium. Our study provides evidence that an oxidizing agent such as H2O2 may affect the biology of P. gingivalis. Moreover, growth of some members of the oral microflora can generate oxidizing and reducing conditions, and thus potentially influence the ecology of subgingival sites by affecting strictly anaerobic bacteria such as P. gingivalis.
TI  - Acid-induced acid tolerance and acidogenicity of non-mutans streptococci.
AB  - Acid tolerance and acidogenicity of non-mutans streptococci and their capacity of acid adaptation were studied. The cells of non-mutans streptococci (Streptococcus sanguis [Streptococcus sanguinis], Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus oralis and Streptococcus mitis) grown at pH 7.0 showed 0.0088% to 71% viability after acidification at pH 4.0 for 60 min, whereas the cells of mutans streptococci (Streptococcus mutans) were not killed by the acidification. Washed cells of non-mutans streptococci lowered pH to 4.04-4.33 in the presence of glucose, while mutans streptococci cells lowered pH to 3.70. When the growth pH was shifted to 5.5 for 30-90 min, the viability of non-mutans streptococci after the acidification at pH 4.0 for 60 min increased (0.25% to 91%) and the minimum pH values of the cells in the presence of glucose decreased (3.90 4.19). Along with the increase in acid tolerance and acidogenicity, non-mutans streptococci increased activities of H(+)-ATPase and arginine deiminase and amounts of stress proteins cross-reacting with 60 kDa and 70 kDa heat shock proteins (Hsp60 and Hsp70). These results indicate that non-mutans streptococci were capable of increasing their acid tolerance and acidogenicity in response to environmental acidification. Furthermore, it is suggested that the acid adaptation observed in non-mutans streptococci cells could involve the induction of H(+)-ATPase, arginine deiminase and stress protein syntheses. The strains of non-mutans streptococci, which are pioneer bacteria for dental plaque formation and predominant in plaque microbial flora, may play a significant role in shifting the dental plaque environment toward acidic and consequently promoting the colonization of more acid-tolerant and acidogenic bacteria such as mutans streptococci and lactobacilli.
TI  - Effect of low-molecular-weight chitosans on the adhesive properties of oral streptococci.
AB  - It was previously shown that a low-molecular-weight chitosan and its derivatives  N-carboxymethyl chitosan and imidazolyl chitosan inhibit Streptococcus mutans adsorption to hydroxyapatite. The ability of the same molecules to interfere with adhesive properties of other oral streptococci (Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus vestibularis) was tested. When saliva-coated or -uncoated hydroxyapatite beads were treated with N-carboxymethyl chitosan, a reduction varying from 60% to 98% depending on strains was observed. Low-molecular-weight chitosans and imidazolyl chitosan did not have any effect. Growth in N-carboxymethyl chitosan-supplemented medium (final concentrations ranging from 20 to 500 micrograms.ml-1) caused a dose related reduction in the adsorption of all strains to hydroxyapatite and in their affinity towards xylene. No effect was observed with low-molecular-weight chitosans and imidazolyl chitosan. In contrast to what observed with S. mutans, the three polysaccharides did not affect detachment from hydroxyapatite beads and adherence to cheek epithelial cells of the other streptococci. These results suggest that low-molecular-weight chitosans and/or imidazolyl chitosan, selectively affecting S. mutans adsorption to hydroxyapatite, may be very interesting as potential anti-dental caries agents.
TI  - Lipoteichoic acid acts as an antagonist and an agonist of lipopolysaccharide on human gingival fibroblasts and monocytes in a CD14-dependent manner.
AB  - CD14 has been implicated as a receptor of lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and other bacterial components as well as lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Since the structures of LTAs from various gram-positive bacteria are heterogeneous, we analyzed the effects of LTAs on the secretion of interleukin-8 (IL-8) by high- and low-CD14-expressing (CD14(high) and CD14(low)) human gingival fibroblasts (HGF). While Bacillus subtilis LTA had an IL-8-inducing effect on CD14(high) HGF which was considerably weaker than that of LPS, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mutans LTAs had practically no effect on the cells. B. subtilis LTA had only a weak effect on CD14(low) HGF, as did LPS. S. sanguis and S. mutans LTAs at a 1,000-fold excess each completely inhibited the IL-8-inducing activities of both LPS and a synthetic lipid A on CD14(high) HGF. The effect of LPS was also inhibited by the presence of an LPS antagonist, synthetic lipid A precursor IVA (LA-14-PP), with a 100-fold higher potency than S. sanguis and S. mutans LTAs and by anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody (MAb). S. sanguis and S. mutans LTAs, LA-14-PP, and anti-CD14 MAb had no significant effect on phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated IL-8 secretion by HGF. These LTAs also inhibited the IL-8-inducing activity of B. subtilis LTA on CD14(high) HGF, as did LA-14-PP and anti-CD14 MAb. The antagonistic and agonistic functions of LTAs were also observed with human monocytes. Binding of fluorolabeled LPS to human monocytes was inhibited by S. sanguis LTA, although the inhibition was 100 times weaker than that of LPS itself, and anti-CD14 MAb inhibited fluorolabeled LPS and S. sanguis LTA binding. Binding of LTAs to CD14 was also observed with nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These results indicate that LTAs act as antagonists or agonists via a CD14-dependent mechanism, probably due to the heterogeneous structure of LTAs, and that an antagonistic LTA might be a useful agent for suppressing the periodontal disease caused by gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Purification and properties of a bacteriocin of Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from dental plaque.
AB  - An extracellular bacteriocin of Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from dental plaque was purified and characterized. Its molecular mass was 3500 Da and pI was 10.5. This bacteriocin inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus salivarius, and Streptococcus mitis, but Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis and other oral indigenous bacterial species examined were not inhibited. The mode of inhibition was found to be bacteriostatic.
TI  - Concentrated bovine colostral whey proteins from Streptococcus mutans/Strep. sobrinus immunized cows inhibit the adherence of Strep. mutans and promote the aggregation of mutans streptococci.
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the effect of bovine colostral whey proteins from cows immunized with Streptococcus mutans/Strep. sobrinus on the adherence and aggregation of caries-inducing bacteria, i.e., mutants streptococci. Both adherence and aggregation are important phenomena in the bacterial colonization of the human oral cavity. In all adherence experiments there was a significant difference between treatments by immune product (IP; from immunized cows) and a control product (CP; a similar product from non-immunized cows). The adherence of 35S-labelled Strep. mutans cells (serotype c) to parotid saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (SHA) was dose-dependently inhibited by both IP and CP if SHA was coated with either product before exposure to bacteria, but markedly lower concentrations of IP than CP were effective. When instead of SHA the bacterial cells were pretreated with IP or CP, only IP strongly and dose-dependently inhibited streptococcal adherence. When bacteria, IP or CP, and SHA were incubated simultaneously, a significant difference between IP and CP treatments was again found. Further, IP effectively aggregated both Strep. mutans and Strep. sobrinus cells, whereas hardly any effect was seen with CP. Both IP and CP aggregated the control bacterium Strep. sanguis, which affected the adherence of the pretreated bacteria.
TI  - [Alpha-hemolytic streptococci and root canal irrigants. An evaluation of the bactericidal efficacy of sodium hypochlorite and chlorhexidine gluconate plus cetrimide].
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The main bacterial species present in pulpal and periapical  microbic flora is alpha-hemolytic streptococci. They are regarded as facultative anaerobes which prefer to grow in anaerobiosis. Canal irrigation plays an important role in the success of endodontic treatment given that, on the one hand, it encourages the gradual elimination of the smear layer, and on the other it neutralises microbic flora in the root canal. The aim of this study was to test the microbiological efficacy of sodium hypochlorite 1% and s new generation irrigant based on chlorhexidine 0.2% and cetrimide 0.2%. METHODS: The test was performed on the following alpha-hemolytic streptococci bacteria (Dasit, Cornaredo, Italy): Streptococcus mitis ATCC 9811; Streptococcus mutans ATCC 35668; Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 13419; Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556. The working concentration (CFU/ml) was defined as 0.5 Mc Farland which corresponds to a concentration of microorganisms of approximately 1.5 x 10(8) bacteria. The following canal irrigants were used: 1) cetrimide 0.2% + chlorhexidine 0.2% (Cetrexidin Vebas, S. Giuliano Milanese, Italy); 2) NaOCl 1% (Ogna, Milan, Italy). Each individual substance remained in contact with the bacterial species used in the test for 10'-20'-30'. RESULTS: The results obtained show the bactericidal efficacy of both the irrigants used, even after a short period of contact. CONCLUSIONS: This does not mean that all irrigants are equal and/or promise the same results. This was a microbiological study, but it is nonetheless important to take other variables into account, such as contact time. Moreover, in order to increase the probabilities for the success of endodontic treatment, canal irrigants must also present other characteristics, namely: biocompatibility, scarce toxicity, high proteolytic power.
TI  - Bacterial eradication from root dentine by ultrasonic irrigation with sodium hypochlorite.
AB  - The study aimed to evaluate intracanal irrigation procedures in eradicating bacteria from surface, shallow and deep layers of root dentine using extracted human teeth. Artificial bacterial smear layer was successfully produced by rubbing a mixture of dental plaque and artificially decalcified dentine or carious dentine on root canal walls. The reservoir holes were 3.5 mm in depth, 1 mm in diameter prepared 1.5 mm apart and parallel to the root canals on the decrowned planes, in which five separate bacterial species were placed (Actinomyces israelii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Propionibacterium acnes, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis). Bacterial eradication after irrigation of the prepared canals was determined by bacterial recovery (i) from the root canal surfaces and shallow layers where bacteria were smeared artificially and (ii) from deeper layers of root canal dentine reservoir holes. Ultrasonic irrigation with 5.5% and 12% NaOCl eradicated bacteria from artificial smear layer (P < 0.0001), whilst 12% NaOCl irrigation with a syringe was insufficient. Ultrasonic irrigation with water or 15% EDTA-failed to eradicate bacteria from smeared surfaces. Ultrasonic irrigation with 12% NaOCl killed A. israelii, F. nucleatum, P. acnes, S. mutans, and S. sanguis placed in reservoir channels, although for F. nucleatum, a very small number of bacteria remained in five samples out of 12. Ultrasonic irrigation with less concentrated NaOCl failed to eliminate bacteria completely from reservoir channels in most samples. Ultrasonic irrigation with 12% NaOCl appeared to eliminate bacteria efficiently from surface, shallow and deep layers of root dentine.
TI  - Acid-regulated proteins induced by Streptococcus mutans and other oral bacteria during acid shock.
AB  - Our previous research has demonstrated that with the more aciduric oral bacteria, an acid shock to sub-lethal pH values results in the induction of an acid tolerance response that protects the cells at extremely low pH (pH 3.0-4.0) that kills unadapted control cells maintained at pH 7.5 (Oral Microbiol Immunol 1997: 12: 266-273). In this study, we were interested in comparing the protein profiles of acid-shocked and control cells of nine organisms from three acid-ogenic genera that could be categorized as strong, weak and non-acid responders in an attempt to identify proteins that could be classified as acid-regulated proteins and which may be important in the process of survival at very low pH. For this, log-phase cultures were rapidly acidified from pH 7.5 to 5.5 in the presence of [14C]-amino acids for varying periods up to 2 h, the period previously shown to be required for maximum induction of the acid response. The cells were extracted for total protein and subjected to one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide chromatography with comparable control and acid-shocked protein profiles compared by scanning and computer analysis. Of particular interest were the proteins in the acid-shocked cells that showed enhanced labeling (i.e., synthesis) over the control cells, since these were considered acid-regulated proteins of importance in pH homeostasis. Streptococcus mutans LT11 generated the most rapid and complex pattern: a total of 36 acid-regulated proteins showing enhanced synthesis, with 25 appearing within the first 30 min of acid shock. The enhanced synthesis was transient with all proteins, with the exception of two with molecular weights of 50/49 and 33/32 kDa. Within the acid-regulated proteins were proteins having molecular weights comparable to the heat shock proteins and the various subunits of the membrane H+/ATPase. By comparison, the strong responder, Lactobacillus casei 151, showed the enhanced formation of only nine proteins within the first 30 min of the acid shock, with a total of 11 acid-regulated proteins formed during the 2-h adaptation period with enhanced synthesis transient for seven of these proteins. Streptococcus salivarius AT2 and Streptococcus gordonii TH12 had the formation of 6 and 8 proteins enhanced, while the weakly responding organisms, Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10,556 and Streptococcus oralis ATCC 10,557, exhibited 8 and 6 such proteins, respectively. Even non-responding strains unable to survive at very low pH, such as Streptococcus sobrinus CH125/43, Streptococcus mitis ATCC 12,261 and Actinomyces naeslundii 301-13 showed the initial formation of 3-9 acid-regulated proteins, but protein synthesis was not sustained over the entire adaptation period. Clearly, the survival of oral bacteria at very low pH is related, not to the total number of the acid-regulated proteins induced per se but to the formation of key proteins that function to augment normal pH homeostasis.
TI  - Composition of pellicles formed in vivo on tooth surfaces in different parts of the dentition, and in vitro on hydroxyapatite.
AB  - Saliva from the major salivary glands dominates different areas of the mouth. The parotid (PS) and submandibular/sublingual (SMS) saliva differ in their protein composition, and thus, the composition of pellicles formed in various parts of the dentition might vary. In this study, proteins incorporated in 60-min pellicles from the premolar and front regions of the mouths of 4 subjects were examined using sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting using antibodies to amylase, albumin, IgA, parotid saliva agglutinin, low molecular weight SMS mucin (MG2) and proline-rich proteins. Pellicles formed in vitro on hydroxyapatite using PS, SMS and whole saliva from the subjects were examined in a similar manner. The pellicles formed in vitro and in vivo showed a major difference in the appearance of albumin. Bands of albumin were clearly stained in the samples of in vivo pellicles but were not observed or hardly visible in Western blots from the experimental, in vitro pellicles. The sites in the dentition from which a specific protein was recovered could differ between the 4 individuals. The overall protein pattern of the pellicles showed, however, characteristics typical of the saliva which may prevail in the part of the mouth where the pellicles were formed. Thus, parotid saliva agglutinin, a receptor for Streptococcus mutans, was primarily found in the premolar part of the dentition. The mucin MG2, which may mediate the adherence of Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus oralis, was in no case clearly seen in pellicles from the premolar region of the upper jaw. The observed variations might be important to the establishment of microflora and tooth-related disease patterns in various parts of the dentition.
TI  - Antibacterial temporary filling materials: the effect of adding various ratios of Ag-Zn-Zeolite.
AB  - The effect of a new type of antibacterial temporary filling material was evaluated. Ag-Zn-Zeolite (Bactekiller, Kanebo, Japan) and SiO2 filler were incorporated into urethane acrylate monomer paste in amounts of 5/55, 10/50, 20/40 and 30/30 wt%, respectively. The present study was designed to use a dye penetration test to measure direct inhibition of bacterial growth of four oral bacteria (Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis). The amounts of silver and zinc ions released from these materials were measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The results indicated that the occurrence of marginal leakage was low in all of these materials. These materials exhibited prominent in-vitro antibacterial activity against S. mutans and S. mitis. The Ag-Zn-Zeolite in these materials was able to release very small but detectable amounts of Ag and Zn even 4 weeks after the immersion started. The larger the amounts of Ag-Zn-Zeolite that were incorporated, the greater the release of silver and zinc. However, it appears that increasing antibacterial activity is not promoted by the higher ratio of Ag-Zn-Zeolite.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity produced by six dentifrices.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of six commercially available dentifrices and positive and negative controls as they come into contact with Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, and Actinomyces viscosus commonly found in the oral cavity. Sterile discs treated with the dentifrices were placed on agar plates with the controls. Zones of microbial inhibition were measured in millimeters after 48 hours. All of the test dentifrices demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the bacteria.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of a bioactive glass paste on oral microorganisms.
AB  - Bioactive glasses contain oxides of calcium, sodium, phosphorus, and silicon in a proportion that provides the material with surface activity and concomitantly with the property of forming a strong bond with bone. Bioactive glasses have been tested as bone substitutes in different clinical situations. In an aqueous environment, Ca2+, Na+, PO4(3-) , and Si4+ are released from the glass, resulting in a rise in pH and in osmotic pressure in its vicinity. Since these are factors that potentially influence the viability of oral microorganisms at the dentogingival margin, we studied the effects of bioactive glass S53P4 on the oral microorganisms Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus sanguis. This was done by incubating each microbe in a suspension, in the presence of bioactive glass S53P4 in powder form. A. naeslundii was found to lose its viability within 10 min under the experimental conditions. A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, and S. mutans lost their viability within 60 min. Also for S. sanguis a significant loss of viability was seen within 60 min, but it was the only microbe that had any viable cells left after 60 min. Thus, in aqueous solutions the powdered bioactive glass S53P4 appears to have a broad antimicrobial effect on microorganisms of both supra- and subgingival plaque. Consequently, it could be useful as an ingredient in tooth-care products that may have beneficial effects on oral health both from a cariologic and a periodontal point of view.
TI  - Binaphthalenone glycosides from African chewing sticks, Diospyros lycioides.
AB  - Our laboratory has engaged in the exploration of active antimicrobial principles  present in chewing sticks commonly used by the African and Middle Eastern countries as a mechanical oral hygiene aid in place of tooth brushing. During this investigation, a methanol extract from the twigs of Diospyros lycioides, a Namibia tooth cleaning stick, demonstrated antimicrobial activity against common oral pathogens including Streptococcus mutans and Porphyromonas gingivalis (MICs 2.5 and 0.156 mg/mL). Subsequent fractionation and purification of this extract led to the identification of two novel binaphathalenone glycosides: 1', 2-binaphthalen-4-one-2',3-dimethyl-1,8'-epoxy-1,4',5,5',8, 8'-hexahydroxy-8-O-beta-glucopyranosyl-5'-O-beta-xylopyranosyl(1-- >6) -beta-glucopyranoside (1) and 1',2-binaphthalen-4-one-2', 3-dimethyl-1,8'-epoxy-1,4',5,5',8,8'-hexahydroxy-5', 8-di-O-beta-xylopyranosyl(1-->6)-beta-glucopyranoside (2). Their structures were established using spectroscopic techniques. Examination of the antimicrobial activity of these two compounds revealed positive but only marginal growth inhibition against the test cariogenic pathogens, S. sanguis and Streptococcus mutans.
TI  - Development of a novel in vitro co-culture system for studying host response to native bacterial antigens.
AB  - We have developed a novel co-culture system in which murine splenocytes are cultured with live bacteria in the presence of a bacteriostatic antibiotic. Superantigens, like staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) are important factors in bacterial pathogenicity. Research has shown that superantigens affect numerous immune cell types, either directly or indirectly, yet their involvement in pathogenic mechanisms remains poorly defined. In these studies, we utilize the co-culture system to study how superantigen pretreatment affects interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production by splenocytes co-cultured with gram-positive bacteria. Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis and Bacillus subtilis were tested for susceptibility to a panel of antibiotics. Spectinomycin was found to maintain a bacteriostatic state of approximately 10(5) bacteria ml(-1) at optimal concentrations for each bacterial strain. Co-culturing splenocytes with bacteria did not affect splenocyte viability and cultured splenocytes responded to mitogenic stimulation as expected. Two days after SEB pretreatment, isolated splenocytes cultured with either Streptococcus species produced 10-15 times more IFN-gamma than splenocytes from sham-injected controls; however, no differences in CD4+ or CD8+ T cell populations appeared in cultures with or without bacteria. Splenocytes isolated four days after SEB treatment did not produce significant amounts of IFN-gamma in co-culture. Co-cultures containing live bacteria produced four times more IFN-gamma than cultures containing heat-killed bacteria. Splenocytes depleted of natural killer (NK) cells prior to SEB treatment produced 25% less IFN-gamma after 20 h co-culturing with S. mutans. T lymphocytes were identified to be the major producer of IFN-gamma at this time point by intracellular cytokine staining. Apparently SEB exposure primes a response to live bacteria and the response is evident two days after initial exposure. The in vitro co-culture system allows us to observe host responses to bacteria in the context of the multicellular interdependent immune response. With this assay we can more closely 'mimic' in vivo events, particularly immune cell interactions in microfloral environments, to study how the pathogenic effects of superantigens alter this response.
TI  - Mutacin production by Streptococcus mutans may promote transmission of bacteria from mother to child.
AB  - The production of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances, mutacins, by mutans streptococci varies among isolates. To find if the degree of mutacin activity of an isolate was related to its transmission between mother and her child, 19 mothers and their 18-month- to 3-year-old children were sampled for their oral mutans streptococci. In addition, the stability of mutacin activity was studied with isolates from the mothers and with isolates from five unrelated 5-year-old children in 5- to 7-year follow-up studies. A total of 145 oral mutans streptococcal isolates were serotyped by immunodiffusion, ribotyped, and mutacin typed by the stab culture technique. Mutacin was produced by 88% of the strains against more than 1 of the 14 indicator strains, representing mutans streptococci, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus gordonii, and Streptococcus pyogenes. Streptococcus mutans isolates showed more inhibitory activity than did Streptococcus sobrinus isolates. Identical ribotypes had similar mutacin activity profiles within a subject, initially and in the follow-up studies, in all but two cases. The mothers harbored a total of 37 different mutans streptococcal ribotypes. Six children were negative for mutans streptococci. Transmission was probable in 9 of 20 mother-child pairs on the basis of the presence of identical strains, as determined by ribotyping and bacteriocin (mutacin) typing. S. mutans strains shared between a mother and her child showed a broader spectrum of inhibitory activity than did nontransmitted strains. In conclusion, the mutacin activity of clinical isolates is reasonably stable, and this virulence factor seems to be of clinical importance in early colonization by S. mutans.
TI  - Whole-cell protein electrophoretic analysis of viridans streptococci: evidence for heterogeneity among Streptococcus mitis biovars.
AB  - One hundred reference strains representing all species belonging to the different phylogenetic lineages of the viridans streptococci were examined by means of one-dimensional whole-organism protein electrophoresis. For most of the species examined, multiple strains characterized by DNA-DNA hybridization were included and, wherever described, representatives of different biochemical variants were analysed. Most species were clearly differentiated. The data support the viewpoint that members of the Streptococcus anginosus group constitute a single species and indicate that Streptococcus mitis biovar 2 is a heterogeneous taxon comprising strains from several streptococcal species.
TI  - Extraction, assay, and analysis of antimicrobials from plants with activity against dental pathogens (Streptococcus sp.)
AB  - Many dental and periodontal diseases are largely a question of bacterial etiology. Dental caries develop due to an increase of strongly acidogenic and aciduric gram-positive bacteria while common forms of periodontal disease are linked to anaerobic gram-negative bacteria in subgingival plaque. Many plants and plant-derived antimicrobial components are used in folklore therapeutics for the treatment of periodontal disorders and for the purposes of oral hygiene. Some have been evaluated for possible use in modern medicine, while thousands of other potentially useful/plants have not been tested. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of screening for antibacterials isolated from plants with activity against three representatives of oral streptococci. We developed and tested the following methodologies: (1) Extraction of antibacterial components from plants; (2) Assays for antibacterial activity; (3) Chromatographic methods for initial analysis of compounds of interest. The screening process for plant antimicrobials consisted of extraction of plant material and assay of antibacterial activity using a spotting test with the selected oral streptococci as indicator strains. In addition, we developed chromatographic procedures that allow characterization and optimization of initial isolation steps. Depending on the indicator microorganisms used, the screening assay can target additional pathogens including other streptococci (group A and B, and pneumococci) and periodontal pathogens such as Porphyromonas. Also, we noted that the activity of some extracts varied against different oral bacteria. Our conclusion, supported by extensive data, was that the screening for antimicrobials from plants is a feasible approach to the identification of natural compounds with antimicrobial properties against dental pathogens.
TI  - Identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  - We have used a PCR assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (sodA(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (S. acidominimus, S. agalactiae, S. alactolyticus, S. anginosus, S. bovis, S. constellatus, S. canis, S. cricetus, S. downei, S. dysgalactiae, S. equi subsp. equi, S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, S. equinus, S. gordonii, S. iniae, S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. parasanguis, S. pneumoniae, S. porcinus, S. pyogenes, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. sobrinus, S. suis, S. thermophilus, and S. vestibularis). Phylogenetic analysis of these sodA(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16S rRNA sequences. We have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their sodA(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the sodA(int) fragments of the type species. We propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.
TI  - Anaerobic killing of oral streptococci by reduced, transition metal cations.
AB  - Reduced, transition metal cations commonly enhance oxidative damage to cells caused by hydroperoxides formed as a result of oxygen metabolism or added externally. As expected, the cations Fe2+ and Cu+ enhanced killing of Streptococcus mutans GS-5 by hydroperoxides. However, unexpectedly, they also induced lethal damage under fully anaerobic conditions in a glove box with no exposure to O2 or hydroperoxides from initial treatment with the cations. Sensitivities to anaerobic killing by Fe2+ varied among the organisms tested. The oral streptococci Streptococcus gordonii ATCC 10558, Streptococcus rattus FA-1, and Streptococcus sanguis NCTC 10904 were approximately as sensitive as S. mutans GS-5. Enterococcus hirae ATCC 9790, Actinomyces viscosus OMZ105E, and Actinomyces naeslundii WVU45 had intermediate sensitivity, while Lactobacillus casei ATCC 4646 and Escherichia coli B were insensitive. Killing of S. mutans GS-5 in response to millimolar levels of added Fe2+ occurred over a wide range of temperatures and pH. The organism was able to take up ferrous iron, but ferric reductase activity could not be detected. Chelators, uric acid, and thiocyanate were not effective inhibitors of the lethal damage. Sulfhydryl compounds, ferricyanide, and ferrocyanide were protective if added prior to Fe2+ exposure. Fe2+, but not Fe3+, acted to reduce the acid tolerance of glycolysis by intact cells of S. mutans. The reduction in acid tolerance appeared to be related directly to Fe2+ inhibition of F-ATPase, which could be assayed with permeabilized cells, isolated membranes, or F1 enzyme separated from membranes. Cu+ and Cu2+ also inhibited F-ATPase and sensitized glycolysis by intact cells to acid. All of these damaging actions occurred anaerobically and thus did not appear to involve reactive oxygen species.
TI  - On the role of human salivary micelle-like globules in bacterial agglutination.
AB  - The hypothesis to be tested in this in vitro study was that the salivary micelle-like globules (SMGs) have a role in the agglutination of some oral bacteria. An attempt to determine the mechanisms for the interactions involved was also carried out. 4 laboratory and 4 native streptococci strains were tested. Human whole (HWS) and parotid (HPS) saliva was collected from 4 subjects, and SMGs were isolated from both salivas, and agglutination was recorded in the various bacterial suspensions over time. HPS, HWS and SMGs isolated from HPS and HWS caused typical agglutination patterns for the mutans strains. Salivary supernatants (without SMGs) caused a much delayed or no agglutination. Electron microscopy showed SMG-like structures on the surface of the agglutinated bacteria. Addition of pyrophosphate to HPS prevented agglutination, whereas guanidine HCl prevented normal agglutination of a sanguis strain, and urea had no obvious effect. Together, these results indicate that the SMGs are important in the agglutination of streptococci, and that both calcium-dependent, electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions may be involved.
TI  - "Checkerboard" versus culture: a comparison between two methods for identification of subgingival microbiota.
AB  - The present study compared the "checkerboard" DNA-DNA hybridization methodology with culture techniques for the analysis of the composition of the subgingival microbiota. 70 subjects, presenting with a variety of periodontal conditions, contributed with a total of 283 subgingival plaque samples analyzed with respect to the following species: Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia/Prevotella nigrescens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Bacteroides forsythus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mutans. Species identification and quantification was performed by (i) the checkerboard method, using whole genomic, digoxigenin labeled DNA probes; and (ii) culture, including non-selective and selective media in combination with routine biochemical testing using commercial test panels. We found that the checkerboard technology resulted in higher prevalence figures for half of the species tested when compared to culture data. If the latter were used as the reference, checkerboard detection sensitivities ranged from 0.17 to 0.86, specificities from 0.17 to 1.0, and diagnostic accuracies from 0.51 to 0.81, depending on bacterial species. The use of the checkerboard data as the reference resulted in detection sensitivities for the culture procedures between 0.24 and 1.0 and specificities between 0.21 and 0.87. The checkerboard methodology resulted in statistically significant higher bacterial counts for the majority of the species. It was further observed that, for most species, the higher the total number colony-forming units in the sample, the higher the discrepancy between the results obtained by the two techniques.
TI  - Identification of clinically relevant viridans group streptococci to the species  level by PCR.
AB  - A PCR assay that allows identification of clinically relevant viridans group streptococci (Streptococcus gordonii, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. salivarius, and S. sanguis) to the species level and identification of milleri group streptococci (S. anginosus, S. constellatus, and S. intermedius) to the group level was developed. This assay was based on specific amplification of internal fragments of genes encoding D-alanine:D-alanine ligases which are species specific and ubiquitous in prokaryotes possessing peptidoglycan. The specificity of this assay was tested on 9 reference strains and 91 characterized clinical isolates. This assay offers a specific and rapid alternative to phenotypic or DNA-DNA hybridization methods for identification of clinically relevant viridans group streptococci.
TI  - Adherence of oral streptococci to an immobilized antimicrobial agent.
AB  - An antimicrobial agent, 3-(trimethoxysilyl)-propyldimethyloctadecyl ammonium chloride, was immobilized on silica. Interaction between the material (termed) OAIS) and various oral bacterial species were then studied. Seven species of Streptococcus and two Actinomyces were investigated for their ability to adhere to this biomaterial. Cell-surface hydrophobicity and zeta-potential were examined as well. Analysis of extracted hydrophobic proteins which adhered to OAIS revealed that the adherence of these micro-organisms was closely related to the hydrophobicity of their cell surfaces. The results of zeta-potential assays indicated that negative charge on the cell surface inhibited adherence to OAIS. Gel electrophoresis revealed that OAIS could absorb cell-surface hydrophobic proteins from all bacterial species tested. Preadsorption of hydrophobic components on the cell surface inhibited adherence of the Strep. mutans strain to OAIS in a dose-dependent manner. The results indicate that OAIS adsorption of these oral bacteria was dependent on the degree of hydrophobicity of their surfaces. A major component of this adherence was hydrophobic cell-surface proteins.
TI  - Thermophysiology of Streptococcus mutans and related lactic-acid bacteria.
AB  - The temperature ranges for growth of Streptococcus mutans GS-5 and S. sobrinus 6715 were found to be very narrow, from about 30 to 47 degrees C, with optimal growth around 37 degrees C. Thus, the organisms showed little potential to grow in the environment outside of the animal host. In contrast wider ranges were found for Enterococcus hirae, S. rattus and S. sanguis. Detailed study of S. mutans GS-5 showed that energetic coupling, reflected in yields of biomass per mol of glucose utilized, were not greatly affected by changes in temperature within the growth range. However, since glycolysis occurred over a wider temperature range (about 10 to 52 degrees C) than growth, yield values dropped to zero at temperatures above or below the growth range. The temperature range for glycolysis could be related to temperature sensitivity of the phosphoenolypyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system for sugar uptake. F-ATPases were active over a similar range of temperatures, but with a broad optimal range from about 30 to 50 degrees C. Proton permeability of S. mutans increased steadily with temperature in a manner similar to that of other mesophilic bacteria, such as Escherichia coli. Growth of the bacteria in media supplemented with various fatty acids had major effects on proton permeabilities but the effects were not well reflected by changes in growth or glycolysis of the bacteria. The overall conclusions were that S. mutans is a typical mesophile in relation to membrane and catabolic functions but its narrow temperature range for growth is related to temperature sensitivities of anabolic systems.
TI  - Pathway for uptake and degradation of X-prolyl tripeptides in Streptococcus mutans VA-29R and Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556.
AB  - The growth of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis in the oral environment requires that these micro-organisms be able to degrade salivary proteins and to assimilate the resulting peptides as an amino nitrogen source. Our research is aimed at the definition of the proteolytic enzyme systems in these oral streptococci which allow them to utilize such substrates. In the present work, the nature of the hydrolytic activity expressed by S. mutans VA-29R and S. sanguis ATCC 10556 against X-Pro4-nitroanilide and X-Pro-Y tripeptide substrates was investigated. This activity was predominantly associated with a cytoplasmic dipeptidyl peptidase which preferentially catalyzes the release of an N-terminal dipeptide from substrates in which proline is the penultimate residue. These streptococci also possess a second cytoplasmic peptidase, pepD, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of X-Pro dipeptides. We found that Gly-Pro-Ala or Ala-Pro-Gly were transported into the bacterial cells only when an energy source such as glucose was present. Peptide uptake was time-dependent, and selective exodus of peptide-derived amino acids from the bacterial cells occurred during peptide uptake. Results from these studies provide evidence that S. mutans VA-29R and S. sanguis ATCC 10556 possess a pathway for the complete degradation of X-Pro tripeptides. Transport of the peptides into cells prior to hydrolysis provides an efficient way by which all amino acids of a peptide may be obtained at an energy expense equivalent to that associated with the transport of just one amino acid. In light of the abundance of proline in salivary polypeptides, this degradative pathway could be an important component in the proteolytic pathway for salivary polypeptide utilization in these oral streptococci.
TI  - Inhibition of purified enolases from oral bacteria by fluoride.
AB  - Enolase activity in strains of oral streptococci previously has been found to be  inhibited by 50% (Ki) by fluoride concentrations ranging from 50 to 300 microM or more in the presence of 0.5 to 1.0 mM inorganic phosphate ions. In this study, enolase was extracted and partly purified by a two-step process from five oral bacterial species and the effect of fluoride on the kinetics of enolase examined. The molecular weight of the putative enolase proteins was 46-48 kDa. The Vmax values ranged from 20 to 323 IU/mg and K(m) for glycerate-2-phosphate from 0.22 to 0.74 mM. Enolase activity was inhibited competitively by fluoride, with Ki values ranging from 16 to 54 microM in the presence of 5 mM inorganic phosphate ions. Ki values for phosphate ranged from 2 to 8 mM. The enolase from Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556 was more sensitive to fluoride (Ki = 16 +/- 2) than was enolase from Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 10575 (Ki = 19 +/- 2) or Streptococcus mutans NCTC 10449 (Ki = 40 +/- 4) and all three streptococcal strains were more sensitive to fluoride than either Actinomyces naeslundii WVU 627 (Ki = 46 +/- 6) or Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 7469 (Ki = 54 +/- 6) enolases. The levels of fluoride found to inhibit the streptococcal enolases in this study are much lower than previously reported and are likely to be present in plaque, especially during acidogenesis, and could exert an anti-glycolytic effect.
TI  - Effects of acidification on growth and glycolysis of Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - After carbohydrate intake, pH in dental plaque decreases rapidly and reaches about 4 within a few minutes. The acidification not only promotes demineralization of tooth surface but can also cause damage to bacteria in dental plaque. We, therefore, investigated the effect of acidification on the dental plaque bacteria Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mutans. At pH 4.0 and 4.2, both growth and glycolytic activities in these streptococci were repressed. Prolonged acidification (for 60 min at pH 4.0) not only repressed both growth and glycolytic activities but also impaired them in S. sanguis cells with concomitant inactivation of the glycolytic enzymes, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, glyceraldehydephosphate dehydrogenase and enolase. The impaired abilities of glycolysis and growth recovered following incubation at pH 7.0 for 80-90 min, and this was accompanied by reactivation of the glycolytic enzymes. On the other hand, these impairments were not observed in S. mutans cells exposed to prolonged acidification. These results indicate that the low pH frequently occurring in dental plaque may transiently impair streptococcal glycolysis and growth and that S. mutans is more durable to the acidification than S. sanguis.
TI  - Variations in the predominant cultivable microflora of dental plaque at defined subsites on approximal tooth surfaces in children.
AB  - The distribution and composition of the resident microflora were determined in approximal gingival margin plaque from 21 premolars extracted from schoolchildren (mean age 12.0 +/- 1.8 yr). Indigo carmine (5% w v) was used to visualize plaque to facilitate sampling. About 1 mm2 of plaque was removed from sites away from (A), to the side of (S), and below (B) the contact area. Plaque samples were dispersed, serially diluted, and cultured on selective and non-selective agar media. An average of seven to nine species was found at each subsite. Streptococcus and Actinomyces were subdivided on the basis of a range of biochemical tests. The predominant Actinomyces and streptococcal species at most subsites were A. naeslundii and Strep. mitis biovar I. A. naeslundii and A. odontolyticus were isolated more often at subsite B (90.5 and 57.1%, respectively), and A. israelii at subsite S (66.7%) Strep. mitis 1 and Strep. sanguis were found more frequently at subsite S (76.2 and 66.7% respectively), whereas Strep mutans, Strep. sobrinus, Strep. gordonii and Veillonella spp. were recovered most commonly from subsite B (85.7, 33.3, 38.1 and 76.2%, respectively). The isolation frequencies of Strep. mutans and Strep. sobrinus were significantly higher at subsite B (A B p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). Veillonella spp. were significantly higher at subsites B and S (A < B, p > 0.01; B > S, p < 0.05), while Neisseria spp. were most common at subsite A (A > B. p > 0.03). IgAl protease-producing species were found at each subsite, but they formed only a small proportion of the total Streptococcus population. This study has shown that local variations were evident at different subsites, both with respect to species prevalence and to proportions of each species within each subsite. The population shifts in gingival margin plaque appear to relate to the location of plaque in relation to the most caries-prone site below the contact area B.
TI  - [Evaluation of a rapid method for the identification of the Enterococcus genus].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The evaluation of the reliability of a group of three tests: pyrrolidonil-arilamidase, rapid test in NaCl esculin broth and group D antistreptococci agglutination for the rapid identification of the Enterococcus genus were performed. METHODS: One hundred fifty-eight strains of streptococci: 110 strains of Enterococcus faecalis, 8 E. faecium, 3 E. avium, 16 Streptococcus intermedius, 7 S. salivarius, 4 S. bovis, 4 S. constellatus, 2 S. sanguis and 1 strain of S. equinus, S. mitis, S. uberis and S. mutans were studied. The tests used were: rapid test in NaCl- esculin broth, pyrrolidonyl-arilamidase and antigroup D streptococcus agglutination (Patho Dx Strep D/PYR; Diagnostic Product Corporation). All catalase-negative gram-positive cocci or coccibacilli which were positive in the three tests were considered to belong to the Enterococcus genus. The usefulness of Gram staining in culture in thioglycolate broth was also studied comparing it with the results obtained with solid medium. RESULTS: The results of the proposed identification scheme were evaluated calculating different parameters: sensitivity 98%, specificity 100%, positive predictive value, 100%, and negative predictive value 94%. No significant differences were observed between the results obtained with Gram staining with thioglycolate broth and those obtained with solid medium except in the case of the Streptococcus mutans strain. CONCLUSIONS: The application of a combination of tests: pyrroidonyl-arilamidase, antistreptococci group D agglutination and rapid test in NaCl-esculin broth to catalase-negative gram-positive cocci and coccobacilli allows reliable identification in a maximum of three hours of strains belonging to the Enterococcus genus.
TI  - Bacterial adherence to guided tissue regeneration barrier membranes exposed to the oral environment.
AB  - Microbial colonization of barrier materials used in guided tissue regeneration (GTR) is known to adversely affect treatment outcomes. The purpose of this study was to compare the rate at which 11 commonly-occurring oral bacteria species colonize three different barrier materials (collagen, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, and polylactic acid). The study group consisted of 10 systemically healthy individuals with no history of periodontal disease and absence of antimicrobial therapy within the previous 3 months. In each patient, 4 teeth per quadrant (P1, P2, M1, M2) were selected and 3 teeth were randomly assigned as test teeth while the remaining tooth acted as a control site (i.e., natural colonization of the tooth surface). These teeth were then randomly assigned to receive one of the three barrier types (i.e., each patient received 4 barriers of each type, 1 per quadrant). A 2 x 5 mm piece of barrier material was positioned over the oral surface of the buccal marginal gingiva and secured with an external sling suture. With oral hygiene procedures suspended, one barrier of each type was collected at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. Slot immunoblot assay demonstrated that all species types (A. actinomycetemcomitans, A. viscosus, B. melaninogenicus, F. nucleatum, P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, S. mutans, S. sanguis, Selenomonas sputigena, T. denticola, and T. vincentii) were present. Semi-quantitative scoring (scale 0 to 3) of slot blot results and analysis by chi-square ratio and Pearson correlation test indicated that while total bacteria adherence increased over time (P < 0.05), the 3 barrier types and the control sites did not differ in numbers or species of colonizing bacteria detected per time point. These results suggest that under these experimental conditions the barrier materials tested do not differ in bacteria adherence or antimicrobial properties.
TI  - The interaction of phospholipid liposomes with bacteria and their use in the delivery of bactericides.
AB  - Liposomes have been prepared from dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) incorporating the cationic lipids stearylamine (SA), dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide (DDAB) and dimethylaminoethane carbamoyl cholesterol (DCchol) and the anionic lipids dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol (DPPG) and phosphatidylinositol (PI). Their adsorption to biofilms of skin-associated bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis and Proteus vulgaris) and oral bacteria (Streptococcus mutans and sanguis) has been investigated as a function of mole % cationic and anionic lipid. Targeting (adsorption) was most effective for the systems DPPC-chol-SA, DPPC-DPPG and DPPC-PI liposomes to S. epidermidis. The effect of extracellular mucopolysaccharide on targeting was investigated for S. epidermidis biofilms. It was found that targeting increased with the level of extracellular mucopolysaccharide for all liposome compositions studied. The delivery of the oil-soluble bactericide Triclosan and the water soluble bactericide chlorhexidine was studied for a number of liposomal compositions. Superior delivery of both bactericides relative to the free bactericide occurred for DPPC-chol-SA liposomes and for Triclosan delivery by DPPC-DPPG and DPPC-PI liposomes targeted to S. epidermidis at low bactericide concentrations. DPPC-chol-SA liposomes were also effective for delivery of Triclosan to S. sanguis biofilms. Double labelling experiments using [14C]-chlorhexidine and [3H]-DPPC suggested that there was exchange between adsorbed liposomes which had delivered bactericide to the biofilm and those in the bulk solution implying a diffusion mechanism for bactericide delivery.
TI  - Sinusitis of dental origin.
AB  - Acute or chronic sinusitis may be odontogenic. Bacteria involved in odontogenic sinusitis are specific organisms associated with the teeth (Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mutans, anaerobic germs). They are often secondary to an intrasinus foreign body following periodontitis. The treatment is both naso-sinusal and dental. Cysts of the maxilla can also invade the sinus. In particular, radiculo-dental cysts (periapical) must be surgically excised, in some cases associated with a middle meatotomy. Finally, one should look for oro-antral fistulae. The surgical technique for its closure should take into account the reversibility of the sinus lesions.
TI  - [Environmental factors in oral cavity effect on growing of Streptococcus sanguis  and Strepococcus mutans-Oxygen of effects]
AB  - Oral Streptococcus species belong to facultative aerobes,and are easily inhibited by metabolic products of oxygen.Our study uses continues culture technique through adding oxygen in order to observe growing states of S.sanguis 34 and S.mutans Ingbritt(c) The result is that the resistance to oxygen of S.sanguis 34 is stronger than S.mutans Ingbritt(c).This result is in accordance with the phenomenon that S.sanguis is a pioneer colonizing germ of dental plaque.The lower resistance to oxygen of S.mutans indicates that the growth and cariogenic action of S.mutans are dependent on the internal circumstance of plaque.
TI  - [Environmental factors in oral cavity effect on growing of Streptococcus sanguis  and Streptococcus mutans-effect of Mucin]
AB  - Our study use continues culture technique through adding mucin as the limiting element in chemically defined culture,medium in order to observe growing states of S.sanguis 34 and,S.mutants Ingbritt(c).The results as follows:S.sanguis 34 were able to grow as pure culture on mucin;S.mutans was unable to grow as a pure culture on mucin,but attained a significant population size in the presence of S.sanguis.These results indicate a synergetic degradation of mucin by S.sanguis and S.mutans in mixed chemism culture.
TI  - [A comparative analysis of biological properties of glucosylrtanterases secreted  by Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mutans]
AB  - Our study make a comparative analysis of biological properties of glucosyltranterases(GTF) secreted by S.sanguis 34 and S.mutans Ingbritt(c).The results as follows:(1)S.sanguis 34 has more extractions of extracelluar GTF than S.mutans Ingbritt(c) under equal cultured conditions,but S.mutans Inggbritt(c) has more activity of extracelluar GTF than S.sanguis.These differences are identical with the difference of their cariogenicities;(2)GTF of S.sanguis 34 can also synthesize water-soluble glucan,and is a multienzyme complex system as S.mutans. S.sanguis might catalyse sufficient dextran formation to stimulate the primer-dependent activity of the S.mutans GTF enzyme. This might aid the adhesion of this comparatively late colonizer;(3)easier to obstruct high pure GTF of S.sangusi 34 S.mutans.
TI  - Differential toxic effects of lactate and acetate on the metabolism of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - Experiments were conducted with Streptococcus mutans NCTC 10449 and Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556 to determine whether the acid end-products, lactate and acetate, were involved in the regulation of cellular growth and metabolism. The growth rate and culture biomass of both organisms was inhibited by the addition of lactate and acetate at concentrations as high as 200 mM to the cultures, although the final pH values of the lactate and acetate cultures were similar. In addition, the metabolic conversion of glucose to lactate was decreased by external lactate but stimulated by acetate. In spite of this, calculation of the yield of cell biomass per mole of ATP (YATP) showed that the yield of both organisms actually increased in the presence of added lactate, but decreased with acetate. This indicates that the two acids interacted with the cells of the organisms by different mechanisms. For both organisms, the final external undissociated lactic acid was relatively constant at concentrations between 0 and 200 mM added lactate, 24.9-32.5 mM for S. mutans and 8.0-11.5 mM for S. sanguis. On the other hand, the final concentration of undissociated acetic acid in the S. mutans cultures increased from 2.9 to 83.7 mM as the medium acetate concentration increased, and from 1.0 to 36.0 mM with the S. sanguis cultures. Counterflow experiments provided evidence for a lactate carrier in both S. mutans and S. sanguis, but an acetate carrier in these organisms could not be demonstrated. [14C]-lactate and [14C]-acetate were taken up into de-energized, chemostatgrown cells of S. mutans and S. sanguis in response to an artificially generated pH gradient but not by an imposed electrical gradient. Thus, under these conditions lactate uptake occurred via a symport process with only one proton. Growth of both organisms in the presence of increasing concentrations of acetate resulted in a small reduction (27%) in the transmembrane pH gradient (delta pH) as measured by the permeant acid, [14C]-salicylate. However, the uptake of [14C]-acetate for the estimation of delta pH revealed significant inhibition of the acetate concentration gradient in the presence external acetate, indicating that the cells expelled the acetate anion. The results indicate that, unlike acetate uptake, lactate transport by S. mutans and S. sanguis was strictly regulated via the lactate carrier in order to prevent excessive dissipation of the pH gradient. Clearly, the formation of acetate by oral streptococci is more problematic for cellular homeostasis than the formation of lactate.
TI  - Saliva mediated adherence, aggregation and prevalence in dental plaque of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis and Actinomyces spp, in young and elderly humans.
AB  - Salivary components in the pellicle mediate bacterial adherence to the tooth. Such components may also aggregate bacteria in saliva and prevent them becoming established in dental plaque. In the present study, the adherence and aggregation of Streptococcus mutans strain Ingbritt, S. sanguis strain 10556 and Actinomyces viscosus-strain 19246 mediated by parotid and whole saliva from groups of young and elderly people were examined. Significant differences were found between test strains, salivary secretions and age groups. S. sanguis 10556 and A. viscosus 19246 generally adhered more strongly than S. mutans Ingbritt, which adhered better to pellicles from parotid saliva than from whole saliva Strain 19246 bound in higher numbers to parotid saliva pellicles from elderly compared to young individuals. Strain 10556 adhered better to whole saliva than parotid saliva pellicles, and the difference was significant among the young individuals, indicating reduced adherence ability in elderly whole saliva. The streptococci were aggregated by parotid and whole saliva, and S. sanguis aggregation was less with whole saliva from the elderly than from the young participants. Besides a correlation between whole saliva aggregation of S. mutans and proportions of bacteria in plaque, no correlations were found for the individual binding properties of saliva and prevalence of bacteria in vivo. However, the level of saliva-mediated adherence in vitro was in the following order: S. mutans. Actinomyces S sanguis, which corresponded to their isolation frequency in plaque. These findings emphasize the importance of initial adherence to salivary receptors in bacterial colonization on teeth. Further studies are needed to reveal if individual patterns in the in vitro binding characteristics of saliva lead to variation of colonization in vivo.
TI  - Lipoteichoic acid from viridans streptococci induces the production of tumor necrosis factor and nitric oxide by murine macrophages.
AB  - Bacterial endotoxin or lipopolysaccharide is the major proinflammatory component  of gram-negative bacteria, but the components of gram-positive bacteria that trigger the inflammatory cascade are poorly understood. Lipoteichoic acid (LTA) purified from 2 strains of viridans streptococci induced the accumulation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) mRNA and protein by the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, in the presence of recombinant interferon-gamma, LTA from both strains of viridans streptococci provoked the accumulation of inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase mRNA and the production of NO. Together these observations indicate that LTA can trigger macrophage activation and the production of TNF and NO and suggest that LTA may be an important determinant of the host inflammatory response to gram-positive infection.
TI  - Plaque pH and microflora of dental plaque on sound and carious root surfaces.
AB  - Given the hypothesis that root caries is the result of acid formation by acidogenic micro-organisms, the present study was performed to relate sucrose-induced pH response of dental plaque on root surfaces to the microbial composition of the overlying plaque. Seventeen caries-active elderly Chinese with poor oral hygiene and with both sound and carious root surfaces were examined. Plaque pH was measured before and up to one hour after a controlled sucrose mouthrinse. Plaque samples for microbiologic analyses were collected from 2 sound and 2 or 3 carious pH-measurement sites in each subject. The prevalence of the following micro-organisms was assessed as % of total viable counts on Brucella agar: Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella melaninogenica, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, Capnocytophaga spp., Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces naeslundi, Streptococcus spp., S. sanguis, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. sobrinus, Lactobacillus spp., and Candida spp. There was no difference in plaque pH response on sound and carious root surfaces. The plaque pH response was more pronounced in the maxilla than in the mandible for both sound and carious sites. There was no difference in microbial composition of dental plaque on sound and carious root surfaces. The pH response to sucrose was the same regardless of the presence or absence of mutans streptococci. Our results thus do not readily support the traditional concept of caries formation.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of 10% carbamide peroxide bleaching agents.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of three commercial 10% carbamide peroxide bleaching agents (Nite White, Karisma, and Opalescence) on Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguis, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus was examined. Chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as a positive control. Test materials and control solution were inserted in wells punched on the surface of disk sensitivity agars seeded with bacteria. After incubation of 24 to 48 h, zones of inhibition were measured. All three of the test materials displayed greater inhibition than the control. The pH of the solutions did not effect the bacterial inhibition.
TI  - Shear bond strength, microleakage and antimicrobial properties of AElitebond.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the shear bond strength (SBS) and microleakage (ML) to dentin as well as the antimicrobial action against five strains of oral bacteria of AElitebond single primer restorative system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen molars were tested to failure for each of the four time periods: 15 minutes, 24 hours, 7 days and 30 days, after final cure. The test specimens were prepared on the dentin surfaces of the extracted molars ground on 600 grit SiC paper. The bonded cylinders were removed from the assembly apparatus after cure, stored in physiological saline at 37 degrees C for the four different time periods and subjected to a shear bond load at 0.5 mm/minute until fractured. For the microleakage determination, Class V cavity preparations were done on the facial surfaces of the roots of 15 canines below the cemento-enamel junction and the specimens thermocycled (500x) between 8 degrees C and 15 degrees C in 2% methylene blue. The teeth were cut into 6 mm thick sections and the sections which included the restorations were separately dissolved in acid. The color intensities of the dissolved sections were measured at a wavelength of 590 nm against a standard curve which was constructed from the dye. The modified model cavity method of Meryon & Johnson (1989) was used to assess the antimicrobial properties of the restorative system. RESULTS: The mean SBS values (in MPa) were found to be 10.3, 9.8, 11.47 and 9.9 after 15 minutes, 24 hours, 7 days, and 30 days, respectively. There was no significant increase (P < 5%) in the SBS after 15 minutes. The ML of 0.76 micrograms dye/ restoration was relatively low in comparison to the SBS values. The restorative system significantly (P < 5%) inhibited the growth of Actinomyces naeslundii with 88%, Streptococcus mutans with 42%, Streptococcus sanguis with 39% and Streptococcus oralis with 9%. However, the growth of Veillonella parvula was stimulated with 49%.
TI  - Effects of sublethal exposure to an antiseptic mouthrinse on representative plaque bacteria.
AB  - Although the mechanism responsible for the clinical antiplaque efficacy of oral antiseptics is generally considered to be primarily one of bactericidal activity, it has been suggested that oral antiseptics may have additional effects on bacteria exposed to sublethal levels. Studies reported herein, investigated the effects of sublethal levels of an essential oil-containing antiseptic mouthrinse (Listerine Antiseptic, Warner-Lambert Co., Morris Plains, NJ) on selected activities of representative plaque microorganisms using in vitro models. These studies demonstrated that sublethal exposure to the tested oral antiseptic can have significant effects in reducing intergeneric coaggregation, increasing bacterial generation time, and extracting endotoxin from Gram-negative bacteria. These in vitro activities can be correlated with features of plaque formation and pathogenicity seen in vivo; however, additional studies will be necessary to confirm that these mechanisms are, in fact, operative clinically.
TI  - A method for evaluating the cariogenicity of oral bacteria using radio-labelled synthetic hydroxyapatite.
AB  - Radioactive hydroxyapatite was synthesized using 45Ca to evaluate the cariogenicity of oral streptococci. Discs prepared from it were suspended in media containing sucrose, then inoculated with Streptococcus mutans or Streptococcus sanguis. The radioactivity in the supernatant fluid was measured at specified time intervals. Released 45Ca in the supernatant fluids markedly increased in both species during the experimental period, while Strep. mutans showed much higher decalcification than Strep. sanguis. The present method would be useful for semi-quantitative evaluation of bacterial decalcification ability.
TI  - The inhibiting effect of aqueous Azadirachta indica (Neem) extract upon bacterial properties influencing in vitro plaque formation.
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to examine the inhibitory effects of aqueous extracts derived from the bark-containing sticks (Neem stick) of Azadirachta indica upon bacterial aggregation, growth, adhesion to hydroxyapatite, and production of insoluble glucan, which may affect in vitro plaque formation. Neem stick extracts were screened for minimal bacterial growth inhibition (MIC) against a panel of streptococci by means of a broth dilution assay. Initial bacterial attachment was quantified by the measurement of the adhesion of 3H-labeled Streptococcus sanguis to saliva-conditioned synthetic hydroxyapatite. The effect of the Neem stick extract upon insoluble glucan synthesis was measured by the uptake of radiolabeled glucose from 14C-sucrose. Aggregating activity of the Neem stick extracts upon a panel of streptococci was also examined. No inhibition of bacterial growth was observed among the streptococcal strains tested in the presence of < or = 320 micrograms/mL of the Neem stick extract. The pre-treatment of S. sanguis with the Neem stick extract or the gallotannin-enriched extract from Melaphis chinensis at 250 micrograms/mL resulted in a significant inhibition of the bacterial adhesion to saliva-conditioned hydroxyapatite. Pre-treatment of saliva-conditioned hydroxyapatite with the Neem stick or gallotannin-rich extract prior to exposure to bacteria yielded significant reductions in bacterial adhesion. The Neem stick extract and the gallotannin-enriched extract from Melaphis chinensis inhibited insoluble glucan synthesis. Incubation of oral streptococci with the Neem stick extract resulted in a microscopically observable bacteria aggregation. These data suggest that Neem stick extract can reduce the ability of some streptococci to colonize tooth surfaces.
TI  - Initial pH as a determining factor of glucose consumption and lactic and acetic acid production in oral streptococci.
AB  - Lactic and acetic acid production was evaluated from six strains of oral streptococci, viz Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus sobrinus cultured in the presence of 1, 5, 10 mM glucose and without glucose, at initial pH values of 5, 5.5, 6 and 7. S. sobrinus and S. salivarius caused the greatest decreases in pH. At pH values of 5 and 5.5, lactic acid and acetic acid production in the species tested was discordant with residual glucose levels. Acid production from protein was especially great in S. mutans and S. salivarius.
TI  - Effect of chlorhexidine varnish on Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies in plaque from dental fissures.
AB  - This study describes the effects of varnish containing 40% chlorhexidine diacetate on Actinomyces naeslundii populations in plaque from human molar fissures. In each of 15 subjects two dental fissures with high levels of mutants streptococci were selected. The experimental treatment consisted of the single application of a small amount of chlorhexidine varnish onto the selected fissures. The varnish was removed 15 min after application. One month after varnish application a significant increase was observed in A. naeslundii counts while the number of mutans streptococci had decreased significantly compared with preexperimental levels. From 85 randomly selected Actinomyces isolates taken from blood agar plates before varnish application, 44% belonged to A. naeslundii genospecies 1 and 56% to A. naeslundii genospecies 2. From 106 isolates taken 1 month after chlorhexidine varnish application, 42% belonged to A. naeslundii genospecies 1 and 58% to A. naeslundii genospecies 2. At baseline 28% of A. naeslundii genospecies 1 strains were catalase-positive, but 1 month after varnish application 4% of the strains were catalase-positive (p < 0.05). It is concluded that chlorhexidine varnish application caused an increase of A. naeslundii in dental plaque, but induced no significant changes in the distribution of the two A. naeslundii genospecies.
TI  - Inhibitory effects of funoran on the adherence and colonization of mutans streptococci.
AB  - Funoran, a sulfated polysaccharide extracted from the seaweed Gloiopeltis furcata strongly inhibited the absorption of mutans streptococci to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (S-HA), but enhanced that of Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556 and Streptococcus oralis ATCC 10557. Furthermore, funoran had a strong desorption activity against mutans streptococci preadsorbed to S-HA. In the presence of sucrose, the absorption of cells of Streptococcus sobrinus B13, Streptococcus mutans Ingbritt, and S. mutans MT8148R to S-HA was strongly inhibited by 0.01% funoran. The colonization of S. sobrinus 6715 inoculated on the molar teeth of experimental rats that were administered funoran was less frequent than that in a funoran-free group. The mean buccal and lingual, sulcal, and total caries scores of rat groups administered funoran were significantly lower than those of the funoran-free group.
TI  - Enhanced bactericidal activity of Arm and Hammer Dental Care.
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare and contrast antibacterial activities of a baking soda-containing dentifrice, Arm and Hammer Dental Care (AHDC) with two fluoride dentifrices without baking soda (Crest and Colgate). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A biphasic approach was taken, utilizing newly-developed laboratory model systems to: (1) assess the activity of brief exposure to dentifrices on single and mixed cultures; and (2) determine the effect of multiple, short-term exposure of sucrose-colonized Streptococcus mutans to simulate cumulative activity against cariogenic plaque. RESULTS: The short-term exposure assays revealed that S. mutans was significantly more susceptible to AHDC than either Crest of Colgate (P<0.05). Moreover, exposure of mixed suspensions of bacteria by AHDC resulted in complete killing of Actinomyces viscosus and significantly greater decreases in S. mutans (P<0.05). This enhanced bactericidal effect was not due to an alkaline pH as pH-adjusted AHDC solutions exhibited similar activity. The comprehensive in vitro plaque studies showed that exposure of colonized S. mutans to AHDC resulted in significantly greater decreases in numbers of viable cells than Crest (P<0.05). Under the conditions employed, the baking soda-containing AHDC exhibited greater antibacterial efficacy overall than the standard Crest or Colgate pastes. These studies suggest that the use of AHDC may provide additional clinical benefit as a result of the enhanced bactericidal activity.
TI  - Evaluation of the automicrobic system for the identification of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The performance of the Automicrobic System with the Vitek gram-positive identification card (bioMerieux, France) in identifying strains of Streptococcus mutans was studied. Of 160 strains assayed, 72.5% were confirmed to be Streptococcus mutans; the remainder were identified as other species of streptocci (Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus sanguis I and II, Streptococcus intermedius, and Streptococcus constellatus).
TI  - Simultaneous monitoring of intracellular pH and proton excretion during glycolysis by Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis: effect of low pH and fluoride.
AB  - A system was developed by which 2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-4 or 5-carboxyfluorescein could be used to monitor intracellular pH at the same time that proton excretion was being measured. Streptococcal cells were loaded with the dye, and after the addition of glucose protons were excreted and the intracellular pH increased quickly and remained higher than the extracellular pH of 7.0. The excretion of protons stopped and the intracellular pH returned to the original level when glucose was depleted. The intracellular level of ATP remained high during glucose metabolism and decreased with the depletion of glucose. At extracellular pH of 5.5, and 5.0, the intracellular pH of fasting cells was higher than the extracellular pH value. After addition of glucose there were initial lags of proton excretion and of increases in intracellular pH at the acidic extracellular pH values. In the presence of fluoride, a lag in proton excretion and a simultaneous decrease in intracellular pH were observed, indicating a partial and transient inhibition of proton-ATPase activity.
TI  - [Adherent mechanism of the mutans of Actinomyces viscosus T14V].
AB  - Three mutans of Actionmyces viscous T14V lacking type1 (5951), type 2 (5519) and  both types of fimbriae (147) were selected in this study. We compared the ability of their adsorption to the test-tube wall, the result of the cellular coaggregation between these mutant strains and Streptococcus sanguis 34, Streptococcus sanguis black bova, Streptococcus mutans ingbritte, Streptococcus sobrinus 6715 and analysed the chemical characterization of cell walls of the three mutans. We found that the specific fimbriae and cell hydrophobicities had great effect on the bacteria adsorption or coaggregation.
TI  - Degradation and fermentation of fructo-oligosaccharides by oral streptococci.
AB  - Fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) are claimed to have a positive effect on the intestinal flora. They are being used in functional foods in Japan and Europe. This group have tested the degradation of two commercial FOS preparations by oral streptococci in order to predict the cariogenicity of these products. Both preparations could be fermented to some extent by the species of oral streptococci tested. The enzymes necessary for the degradation of FOS were inducible. Each strain showed a specific degradation pattern. All strains, particularly Streptococcus mutans rapidly produced acid, mainly lactic acid. Streptococcus mitis also produced high concentrations of acetic acid. Plaque formation by Strep. mutans was similar to the sucrose control. It is concluded that FOS are cariogenic to a similar extent as sucrose.
TI  - Oral streptococci with genetic determinants similar to the glucosyltransferase regulatory gene, rgg.
AB  - The Streptococcus gordonii Challis glucosyltransferase structural gene, gtfG, is  positively regulated by the upstream gene, rgg, the only described gtf regulatory determinant in oral streptococci. Southern hybridization analyses indicated that rgg-like and gtfG-like determinants were present on the same HindIII fragment in strains of S. gordonii, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus oralis, whereas no rgg-like determinants were detected in mutans streptococci, Streptococcus mitis, and Streptococcus salivarius.
TI  - Cross-reactivity between human sialyl Lewis(x) oligosaccharide and common causative oral bacteria of infective endocarditis.
AB  - The expression of sialy-Lewis(x) (sLe(x); Neu5Ac alpha 2-3 Gal beta 1-4) (Fuc alpha 1-3) GlcNAc-R) on oral bacteria producing infective endocarditis was determined by a whole-cell enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and an immunoelectron microscopy using the well-characterized anti-sLe(x) monoclonal antibody SNH-3 (mAb SNH-3; IgM class). mAb SNH-3 reacted strongly with whole cells of oral bacteria: Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Eikenella corrodens and Porphyromonas gingivalis. The negatively stained immuno-electron micrograph of Streptococcus pyogenes showed many reactive gold particles on the cell surface. Our findings demonstrated the existence of immunologic mimicry between the sLe(x) oligosaccharide and cell surface antigens of many species associated with infective endocarditis. We propose the hypothesis that if these bacteria escape their normal habitats, the surface components that mimic the sLe(x) oligosaccharide might bind to host antigens of the selectin family which could promote binding to endothelial cells and, consequently, initiation of the events leading to infective endocarditis.
TI  - Antibacterial action of dental cements: an in vitro study.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of seven commercially available dental cements (Eugespad, Dentical, Dycal, Expaliner, PR. Scell, PR. Base Cement, PR. Lining Cement) against 1) bacterial species implicated in carious lesions or in dental plaque (Actinomyces israelii ATCC 10048, Actinomyces viscosus ATCC 19246, Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10557) and 2) bacterial samples of stimulated saliva was studied, in vitro, using a modification of the method of McComb and Ericson (1987). Dycal and Expaliner did not affect bacteria whereas the other dental cements displayed some antibacterial properties. Eugespad was the most active followed by PR. Base Cement + PR. Scell + Dentical and by PR. Lining Cement. Associated with mechanical and biocompatibility properties, these differences could be taken into account when choosing a dental cement for clinical use.
TI  - Quantifying the strength of bacterial adhesive interactions with salivary glycoproteins.
AB  - We adapted an assay that has been used to estimate the strength of eukaryotic cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix adhesive interactions (McClay et al., 1981) to quantify the strength of bacterial (streptococci, fusobacteria, actinomyces) interactions with salivary receptors. Bacteria are centrifuged onto human submandibular/sublingual or parotid-saliva-coated microtiter wells. Plates are sealed with pressure-sensitive, double-sided tape which allows them to be inverted and centrifuged again. The force required to remove the bacteria from the coated wells is a direct measure of the adhesive strength of the interaction(s) being disrupted. The bacteria-saliva adhesive forces we detected ranged from 1.6 x 10(-8) dynes (Streptococcus sanguis 72-40) to > 1.1 x 10(-7) dynes (Actinomyces viscosus T14 V). These forces were in the range to withstand the shear stress produced by salivary flow, which we calculated as approximately 6.1 x 10(-7) dynes.
TI  - Post-antibiotic effect of azithromycin and erythromycin on streptococcal susceptibility to phagocytosis.
AB  - The effect of azithromycin and erythromycin on growth, cell surface hydrophobicity and the susceptibility to the bactericidal activity of human polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNL) was examined in four Streptococcus species. Exposure to either 10 x MIC azithromycin or erythromycin induced a post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of between 2.4 and 4.3 h. Erythromycin caused a longer PAE for S. sanguis than azithromycin under the same conditions. The cell surface charge (hydrophobic or hydrophilic) of the streptococci was altered significantly during PAE; loss of hydrophobicity was induced by both macrolides, and this effect was variable amongst the species. The decrease in hydrophobicity was not related to inhibition of growth. The effect of each drug during PAE on the interaction of opsonised suspensions of the streptococci with human PMNL revealed that erythromycin, and to a lesser extent azithromycin, increased susceptibility to the bactericidal activity of human PMNL; this effect was abolished following PAE. The present study clearly showed that PAE should not only be considered as delayed bacterial growth, but also as modulation of bacterial susceptibility to phagocytosis which may influence the outcome of the host-parasite relationship.
TI  - Adherence of Candida albicans to a cell surface polysaccharide receptor on Streptococcus gordonii.
AB  - Candida albicans ATCC 10261 and CA2 bound to cells of the oral bacteria Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus sanguis when these bacteria were immobilized onto microtiter plate wells, but they did not bind to cells of Streptococcus mutans or Streptococcus salivarius. Cell wall polysaccharide was extracted with alkali from S. gordonii NCTC 7869, the streptococcal species to which C. albicans bound with highest affinity, and was effective in blocking the coaggregation of C. albicans and S. gordonii cells in the fluid phase. When fixed to microtiter plate wells, the S. gordonii polysaccharide was bound by all strains of C. albicans tested. The polysaccharide contained Rha, Glc, GalNAc, GlcNAc, and Gal and was related compositionally to previously characterized cell wall polysaccharides from strains of S. oralis and S. sanguis. The adherence of yeast cells to the immobilized polysaccharide was not inhibitable by a number of saccharides. Antiserum raised to the S. gordonii NCTC 7869 polysaccharide blocked adherence of C. albicans ATCC 10261 to the polysaccharide. The results identify a complex cell wall polysaccharide of S. gordonii as the coaggregation receptor for C. albicans. Adherent interactions of yeast cells with streptococci and other bacteria may be important for colonization of both hard and soft oral surfaces by C. albicans.
TI  - Distribution and determinants of mutans streptococci among African-American children and association with selected variables.
AB  - Prevalence of mutans streptococci (MS) and the effect of selected variables, including the early childhood use of antibiotics on the oral colonization of MS, were studied among 353, 5- to 12-year-old African-American children using a cross-sectional study. MS prevalence was estimated using pooled plaque and stimulated saliva samples (spatula). Data on antibiotic use and other potential determinants of oral colonization of MS were obtained using a self-administered questionnaire. Antibiotic data were validated using health records of subjects. MS prevalence (92%, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] = 89-95%) was associated with dental caries (Odds Ratio [OR] = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.3-6.2), age (Chi for trend = 4.3, P = 0.04), increased frequency of sweet consumption (Chi for trend = 5.1, P = 0.02), and increased number of teeth in the mouth (unit OR = 1.3, 95% CI = 1.1-1.6). Higher MS levels were associated with higher number of decayed teeth (P < 0.0001), and also, with having the mother as the primary caregiver during the second year of life (P = 0.02). Furthermore, children who took antibiotics during early childhood and those who lived in the same household with many others during the second year of life had a higher MS prevalence than those who did not (OR = 8.3, 95% CI = 2.0-35.0; unit OR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.03-2.2, respectively). It is unclear why those exposed to antibiotics during the "window of infectivity" of MS exhibit a higher MS prevalence. Antibiotic-related oral ecological changes (i.e, lower levels of S. sanguis) and environmental changes (i.e., frequent exposure to sugar through most pediatric antibiotic preparations) may make the oral cavity more favorable for initial MS colonization.
TI  - Delmopinol interactions with cell walls of gram-negative and gram-positive oral bacteria.
AB  - The main purpose of the present study was to investigate the influence of delmopinol hydrochloride on the cell surface morphology of gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial cells by using transmission electron microscopy. A second purpose was to evaluate the extraction of cell wall material caused by delmopinol and the binding of radiolabelled delmopinol to the various strains. Fresh isolates and type strains of gram-negative rods associated with periodontal disease, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and strains of the gram-positive streptococci Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus salivarius, were exposed to 3.2 mM (0.1%) or 6.4 mM (0.2%) delmopinol hydrochloride from 1 to 90 min. For electron microscopy the cells were fixed and negatively contrast-stained. Treatment with 6.4 mM delmopinol for 1 min resulted in marked ultrastructural changes of cell wall components and the outer cell membrane of the 3 gram-negative species compared with control cells, whereas the gram-positive streptococci treated with delmopinol showed little or no morphologic alteration as compared with untreated cells. The result from the electron microscopy was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of proteins released from bacterial cells treated as for electron microscopy. More material was extracted from the gram-negative rods than from the gram-positive cocci. Significantly more delmopinol bound to the gram-negative rods than to the streptococci. It appears that the amphiphilic properties of delmopinol make gram-negative rods more vulnerable to delmopinol than gram-positive streptococci.
TI  - Determination of 16S rRNA sequences of Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus gordonii and phylogenetic relationships among members of the genus Streptococcus.
AB  - We determined the 16S rRNA sequences of the type strains of Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus gordonii and calculated the phylogenetic distances between those organisms and other members of the genus Streptococcus. The viridans group streptococci were separated into five phylogenetic groups; we named these groups the anginosus group, the mitis group, the salivarius group, the bovis group, and the mutans group. S. mitis and S. gordonii clustered in the mitis group together with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus parasanguis at levels of sequence homology of more than 96%. Within this group, S. mitis, S. oralis, and S. pneumoniae exhibited more than 99% sequence homology with each other, although the DNA-DNA similarity values for their total chromosome DNAs were less than 60%.
TI  - Transformation of naturally competent Streptococcus mutans with replicative and non-replicative Tn916-containing plasmids: implications for a mechanism of transposition.
AB  - Based on the observations reported here and what is known concerning transformation of naturally competent strains of S. mutans and other streptococcal species such as S. gordonii, we propose the model shown in Figure 2. The Tn916-intermediate transforms S. mutans as originally proposed for B. subtilis by Scott and coworkers [8]. It is not clear in either system (B. subtilis or S. mutans) whether the Tn916 intermediate enters the cell as ds-DNA or ss-DNA. Because it is likely that transformation of B. subtilis via formation of protoplasts involves a mechanism quite different from natural transformation in S. mutans, it would be unwise to extrapolate findings from their studies. If Tn916 enters S. mutans in a manner similar to plasmid or chromosomal DNA, we would assume that Tn916 binds to a cell receptor and as one strand enters, the other is degraded [9]. This leaves open the question of whether Tn916 recircularizes as ds-DNA before it inserts into the chromosome or whether it remains as ss-DNA, if, indeed, it enters as ss-DNA. The transformation efficiency for the Tn916 intermediate (approximately 10(-7) precluded kinetics studies such as those performed with pAM118. Poyart-Salmeron and coworkers [11] however, described a model in which Tn1545 inserts into the target site as a ds-DNA circular molecule, similar to that seen with lambda phage. Perhaps the most interesting finding presented here is that the predominant mechanism of insertion of Tn916 into the chromosome of the recipient occurs after Tn916 enters the cell. The replicative plasmid pAM118 evidently forms by two-hit kinetics followed by intracellular excision and transposition of Tn916. The helper-rescue experiment shows that in this system, the formation of Tcr transformants, and hence the integration of Tn916, was a function of the transformation efficacy of plasmid pAM118. Since intracellular excision of Tn916 probably follows the re-formation of the plasmid pAM118, the rate-limiting step in this system would be the formation of the transient, intracellular plasmid pAM118. (The transient white colony phenotype probably denotes the slower growth rate of transformants that acquire the large replicative plasmid pAM118). Our findings demonstrate that a practical way of promoting Tn916 insertions into chromosomal DNA for the purpose of obtaining mutations is to use a helper-rescue system. Our model supports the concept that the majority of Tn916 inserts arise from a mechanism similar to 'zygotic induction' as proposed for S. sanguis (gordonii) [1]. However, the frequencies for the co-establishment of the replicative plasmid (Emr) and Tn916 inserts (Tcr) in their paper (10(-6)) differ from our observations for S. mutans. We found nearly 100% of Tcr white colonies to be Emr whereas in S. gordonii, only a fraction (approximately 1%) exhibited the TcrEmr phenotype. If both phenotypes arose independently, the frequency of the TcrEmr phenotype would be 10(-8) rather than 10(-6) survivors/recipients as observed. It was surmised that both Tcr and Emr transformants arise dependently [1] where both the Tn916 intermediate and pAM118 contribute to the formation of Tn916 inserts. We conclude from their data, however, that most Tcr arose from the Tn916-intermediate formed in the donor, in agreement with the explanation of these data by Scott [12]. Support for the contention that the Tcr arose in S. gordonii from transformation by the Tn916-intermediate as in S. mutans (yellows), and not from intracellular excision from pAM118, comes from the observation that so few Tcr are Ems and because pAM150 (rep-) yields Tcr at the same frequency as the rep+ pAM118 in their experiments. In summary, the Tn916 intermediate is capable of transforming S. mutans. In contrast to the hypothesis of Scott [12], however, the Tn916 intermediate is not the only form involved in the transformat++t
TI  - Adherence of microorganisms to rat salivary pellicles.
AB  - Numerous studies, using models to mimic the formation of the acquired pellicle, have concentrated on human saliva-coated hydroxyapatite; in contrast, although the rat is frequently used as an animal model, the information concerning the formation of pellicles from rat saliva is sparse. We compared the ability of Streptococcus and Actinomyces species to adhere to hydroxyapatite coated by rat saliva (rsHA) and human saliva (sHA). We also explored the influence of glucan synthesized in situ on the adherence of organisms. We show that each strain of organism has a distinct binding pattern, which was essentially the same with surfaces coated with either rat or human saliva. Dissolved rsHA beads revealed a major protein band (35-49 kD), identified as glutamine/glutamic-acid-rich protein; acidic proline-rich protein (31-45 kD and alpha-amylase (66 kD) were also identified. Overall, these in vitro data strongly suggest that the principles of bacterial adhesion to rsHA are similar to those observed with sHA.
TI  - Acid production by human strains of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus.
AB  - Acid production by washed suspensions of human strains of Streptococcus mutans (n = 18) and Streptococcus sobrinus (n = 12) was measured. The strains were isolated from infants and adolescents with varying caries experience. Some of these strains and two laboratory strains (1 S. mutans and 1 S. sobrinus) had been tested in an earlier study for their cariogenicity in hamsters. Further, 3 Streptococcus sanguis strains and 1 S. sobrinus laboratory strain were included. Acid production was determined in repeated titration experiments at a constant pH of 5.5. Higher mean acid production activities (p < 0.05) were obtained by S. sobrinus compared with both S. mutans and S. sanguis. However, large variations among the strains were found both between and within the species. No clear relationship was found between the glycolytic activity of strains and the caries prevalence of the children from whom the strains had been isolated or the caries scores in a hamster model. In conclusion, although both S. mutans and S. sobrinus have aciduric and acidogenic properties, it is difficult to relate the acid production activity of pure cultures in vitro to the caries process in vivo.
TI  - A comparison of the microbial flora in carious dentine of clinically detectable and undetectable occlusal lesions.
AB  - It is not known whether the aetiology of occlusal hidden caries lesions (HCL) is  identical to that of small visible lesions (SVL). Previous studies of the microflora of HCL suggest that relatively few species can be isolated. The aim of the present study was to compare the bacterial composition of dentine from 10 HCL and 17 SVL in a population of children aged 8-18 years. The following bacteria were identified: Actinomyces spp., mutans streptococci, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus gordonii. Streptococcus mitis, and Lactobacillus spp. Streptococcus mutans was found more often in the HCL group (p = 0.03), while Streptococcus sobrinus was found more often in the SVL group (p = 0.05). However, proportions of both species were lower in the SVL group as compared with the HCL group (S. mutans p = 0.07; S. sobrinus p = 0.03). Lactobacilli and Actinomyces spp. were found at similar levels in both groups. A more diverse range of streptococcal species and Veillonella was found in the SVL group (p = 0.001). These results show a less complex microflora in HCL as compared with SVL, indicating that the aetiology of hidden caries might be different from that of open caries.
TI  - Streptococci and actinomyces inhibit regrowth of Streptococcus mutans on gnotobiotic rat molar teeth after chlorhexidine varnish treatment.
AB  - Clinical studies suggest that the long-term suppression of mutans streptococci on tooth surfaces after intensive chlorhexidine therapy is mainly due to bacterial interference. Other streptococci and also Actinomyces naeslundii are proposed to inhibit regrowth of mutans streptococci after suppression by the agent. We have tested this hypothesis in gnotobiotic rats associated with Streptococcus mutans alone, or associated with S. mutans and strains of Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mitis biovar I, and A. naeslundii. Left lower jaws in these rats were treated with concentrated chlorhexidine varnish, and the return of S. mutans on the treated jaws monitored. In mono-associated rats, S. mutans regained the level of the untreated right lower jaw in approximately 1 week. In contrast, S. mutans remained suppressed for several weeks in rats multi-associated with other streptococci and actinomyces strains. The suppression was more pronounced in the rats fed on basal diet with little free sugars than in rats fed on a sucrose-containing diet. Counts of other streptococci recovered quickly from the intensive chlorhexidine treatment, but A. naeslundii remained suppressed for at least 1 week. The findings demonstrate the crucial importance of the oral microflora in controlling regrowth of mutans streptococci after chemotherapy.
TI  - [Clinical significance of bacteremia caused by streptococci of the viridans group].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The viridans group Streptococcus (SVG) include species which may have different pathogenic capacity. This study was aimed at evaluating the clinical significance of bacteremia by different species of SVG. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred ninety-four clinical records of patients with blood culture(s) isolation (Hemoline/BioMerieux) of SVG (Api 20 STREP/BioMerieux) over 9 years were reviewed with criteria of clinical significance being established and the results analyzed by the chi square test. RESULTS: The most frequent species of SVG isolated were: S. sanguis II (29.4%), S. mitis (27.3%) and S. anginosus (12.9%). With regard to the criteria established, 36% of the isolates were clinically significant, associating S. anginosus with significant bacteremia (p = 0.001) and S. mitis with non significant bacteremia (p = 0.04). More than half of the isolations of S. anginosus, S. bovis, S. mutans and S. adjacens were clinically significant with this rate being lower in the remaining species (S. sanguis I, S. sanguis II, S. mitis, S. salivarius and S. acidominimus). The significant isolations correspond with endocarditis (S. sanguis II being responsible for 44%; p = 0.05). In 54.3% of the cases followed by abscesses or other localized infections and severe sepsis in patients with a solid or hematologic tumor with a mortality of 20%. The endocarditis/other disease relation was: greater for the existence of endocarditis for S. sanguis II, S. sanguis I, S. mutans, S. bovis and S. adjacens; similar in both diseases for S. mitis, and greater for the existence of a non endocardic disease for S. anginosus. CONCLUSIONS: In this series the isolation of SVG group was clinically significant in 36% of cases with a probability of clinical significance and disease association related to the species isolated of SVG.
TI  - Action of sodium fluoride on phagocytosis by systemic polymorphonuclear leucocytes.
AB  - Alterations in phagocytosis appear to be important in the onset and development of periodontitis. We investigated new substances that may be of use in the treatment of periodontitis. In a preliminary study, we tested the effect of sodium fluoride on phagocytosis by circulating polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNs) in 10 replicate assays using blood from six healthy subjects. Sodium fluoride was tested at concentrations of 1.0 micron to 4.0 microns against Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus and Streptococcus sanguis. The phagocytic index against all microorganisms increased significantly at all concentrations of sodium fluoride assayed; this effect was dose dependent. Sodium fluoride appeared to stimulate phagocytosis via two mechanisms: an apparent increase in bacterial susceptibility to phagocytosis, and direct stimulation of phagocytosis by PMNs.

TI  - Lipoteichoic acid from Streptococcus sanguis is a natural glucosyl acceptor for glucosyltransferases.
AB  - The synthesis of methanol insoluble-[14C]labeled-polymers from [14C]sucrose by S. mutans glucosyltransferases was stimulated up to four-fold by the presence of highly purified, lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from S. sanguis. Gel filtration chromatography (Sepharose 4B) and ion exchange chromatography (DEAE-Bio-Gel A) of the [14C]labeled-polymers formed in the presence of [3H]glycerol-labeled-LTA showed that high molecular weight, negatively charged [14C]labeled-[3H]glycerol-labeled-LTA complexes were being formed. The [14C]component was identified as glucose by acid hydrolysis and paper chromatography. A similar high molecular weight, negatively charged [14C]glucosyl-[3H]glycerol-labeled-polymer was extracted from S. mutans cells grown in the presence of [3H]glycerol and [14C]sucrose, suggesting that LTA is a glucosyl-acceptor for glucosyltransferases in vivo as well as in vitro.

TI  - Biochemical change exhibited by oral streptococci resulting from laboratory subculturing.
AB  - The intent of this study was to assess the effects of continued laboratory subculturing on selected biochemical properties of oral streptococci freshly isolated from dental plaque. Six fresh isolates (3 Streptococcus mutans and 3 non-mutans) and 2 laboratory strains were subcultured daily for a total of 225 transfers, and cells were harvested every 75 transfers from duplicate batch cultures grown with glucose at a constant pH. Eleven biochemical properties were assayed with cells, membranes and cell-free extracts and the results subjected to statistical analysis for differences between the duplicate cultures and the various subcultures. In addition, the activity of 19 hydrolytic enzymes was assayed with the semiquantitative apiZYM system (Analytab products). The activity of zero-time samples varied by as much as 241-fold for a single property with particularly low activity for EIIglc of the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system and cell-associated extracellular polysaccharide synthesis. The 3 S. mutans fresh isolates had higher activity in 8 of the 11 assays compared with the 3 non-mutans strains, with extracellular polysaccharide synthesis the most significant trait. Statistical analysis of the 2816 assays of the 11 traits for the 8 test strains at the 4 selected time intervals revealed considerable change in the activity of the test parameters. The most notable changes in the S. mutans strains over the 225 subcultures were significant increases in glycolytic activity and decreases in hydrophobicity and extracellular polysaccharide synthesis activity. Of the measured properties, lactate dehydrogenase and cell-associated extracellular polysaccharide synthesis activity were the most stable and H+/ATPase activity was the most variable.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - An in vitro investigation of the cariogenic potential of oral streptococci.
AB  - Whilst the importance of the mutans streptococci in the aetiology of dental caries is clear, a number of studies have described caries development in their absence. This investigation aimed to assess the cariogenic potential of Streptococcus gordonii, Strep. sanguis, Strep. vestibularis and Enterococcus faecalis in comparison with Strep. mutans and Strep. sobrinus, using a recently described in vitro model. In the presence of a 146 mM sucrose solution and powdered hydroxyapatite, each species was incubated for 5 h, after which acid anion production, calcium release and change in pH were measured. It was possible to assign each species to one of three groups, with E. faecalis, Strep. gordonii, Strep. sanguis exhibiting low, Strep. vestibularis intermediate, and Strep. mutans and Strep. sobrinus high in vitro cariogenic potential. This assay could be used as a screening test to assess the potential cariogenicity of a range of bacterial species.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological effects of chlorhexidine and arginine sustained-release varnishes in the mentally retarded.
AB  - Local applications of sustained-released varnishes of chlorhexidine and arginine  were used in a controlled pilot study of 34 mentally retarded patients, ages 18-45, assigned to one of these groups: chlorhexidine (C), arginine (A), or placebo (P). A professional scaling followed by four weeks of professional brushing to reach a Plaque Index (PII) and Gingival Index (GI) of 1.0 at baseline preceded eight weeks of daily varnish application to the buccal and labial surfaces of all teeth. Clinical parameters (PII and GI) and bacterial samples from selected teeth were collected at predetermined intervals. Four and eight weeks following the baseline, the PII was significantly different among the groups, with the lowest score in the chlorhexidine group. No significant differences among the three groups were noted for the GI. The chlorhexidine and arginine groups showed significant reductions (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively) in the number of S. mutans. The arginine group showed a nonsignificant increase in the number of S. sanguis. These results suggest that the topical antimicrobial agents may have some relevance to plaque control among patients with mental retardation.
TI  - Hospital practices influence the pattern of infective endocarditis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify factors contributing to infective endocarditis at a major  teaching hospital. METHODS: Retrospective review of clinical records of patients diagnosed with endocarditis by standard case definitions with respect to causative organisms, clinical features and outcome. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-three episodes of endocarditis seen between 1979 and 1992 at Westmead Hospital, Sydney, were reviewed. In the 174 cases where the causative organism was isolated, 75 (43%) were Staphylococcus aureus and 50 (29%) were viridans streptococci. Nosocomial acquisition and/or inter-hospital transfer accounted for 83 episodes; 48 (58%) S. aureus (P < 0.001) and nine (11%) viridans streptococci (P < 0.001). In cases from the local community, viridans streptococci were more common than S. aureus (37% versus 25%); these included 18 episodes (14 S. aureus) in intravenous drug users. CONCLUSION: We conclude that, compared with community-acquired infections, the aetiology of endocarditis in a large teaching hospital is influenced strongly by the prevalence of nosocomial endocarditis and the need for interhospital transfer of complicated cases.
TI  - A study of the subgingival microflora of HIV-seropositive and CD4 cell depleted children with hemophilia.
AB  - The cultivable subgingival bacterial flora from three HIV-seropositive and CD4 cell depleted children with hemophilia were examined in this study. The numbers of CD4 cells of the subjected children ranged from 4.9 to 16.3 per mm3 blood. Streptococcus species, including, beta-hemolytic streptococcus identified as Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis, were predominant in the subgingival plaque samples. Actinomyces species were also frequently found. Gram-negative rods other than Capnocytophaga species were not common in these samples. It is possible that the subgingival microbial flora are influenced by the CD4 cell decrease with HIV infection.
TI  - Bactericidal action of tachyplesin I against oral streptococci.
AB  - Tachyplesin I, a polycationic antimicrobial peptide isolated from hemocytes of horseshoe crabs, kills bacteria by disrupting the membrane potential of the cytoplasmic membrane. The present study shows that, among 36 oral streptococcal strains, 12 of 21 Streptococcus sanguis, 3 Streptococcus mutans, 9 Streptococcus salivarius and 3 Streptococcus milleri strains were susceptible to tachyplesin I, whereas 9 S. sanguis strains were resistant. Interestingly, these resistant strains include the clinical isolates from both Kawasaki disease and Behcet patients. According to the time-kill study, tachyplesin I inhibited irreversibly the growth of S. sanguis, S. mutans and S. salivarius strains within 20 min and an S. milleri strain within 80 min. Although it has been suggested that Escherichia coli cultured in rich media were more susceptible to tachyplesin I, the present results show that only 3 S. milleri strains were more sensitized to tachyplesin I in a glucose-supplemented medium, and other tested strains were not. Similarly, only 4 strains were more resistant to tachyplesin I in saline than these were in a rich medium.
TI  - Identification of viridans streptococci associated with bacteraemia in neutropenic cancer patients.
AB  - Twenty-three viridans streptococcal isolates from pyrexial neutropenic patients with various malignant diseases were studied in a comprehensive identification scheme. Fourteen isolates were identified as Streptococcus oralis, five as S. mitis and two as S. salivarius but the remaining two could not be identified reliably. The virulence mechanisms associated with the ability of these species to survive and grow in vivo require further investigation but may involve the production of specific glycosidase and proteolytic enzyme activities.
TI  - Association of salivary bacterial aggregating activity with sulfomucin.
AB  - The requirements of human salivary mucins for aggregating potential towards the common cariogenic oral bacteria, S. mutans and S. sanguis, were investigated. Agglutination inhibition assays demonstrated that the aggregating capacity towards bacteria resides in the acidic mucin fraction. The inhibitory activity of the acidic mucin decreased only 2-4-fold following removal of sialic acid, whereas the desulfation caused a complete loss of the inhibitory potential against both bacteria. Furthermore, the aggregating capacity of mucin-derived sulfated oligosaccharide was found to be 16-fold higher than that of the sialic acid containing oligosaccharide. The results point towards the importance of salivary sulfomucins as a predominant factor in the defense of oral cavity against cariogenic bacteria.
TI  - Growth-inhibitory effect of pyrophosphate on oral bacteria.
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether pyrophosphate, the anticalculus component of tartar-control dentifrices, exerts antimicrobial activity against oral bacteria commonly found in supragingival plaque. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of pyrophosphate were determined for Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans (serotype c), Actinomyces viscosus and Actinomyces naeslundii. All of the bacteria tested were susceptible to pyrophosphate with identical minimal inhibitory concentrations of 0.67% wt/vol (25 mM). Bactericidal kinetics assays revealed that both S. mutans and A. viscosus were killed by pyrophosphate, with the latter being considerably more susceptible. The mechanism of killing was not due to high ionic strength, as comparable controls showed no loss in numbers of viable cells. Brief exposure (two 5-min incubations) of S. mutans to pyrophosphate and sodium dodecyl sulfate caused pronounced inhibition of growth over the 24-h test period. Under the constraints of the conditions used, these studies indicate that pyrophosphate and sodium dodecyl sulfate can substantially inhibit the growth of oral bacteria. These compounds may affect the oral microflora of patients who routinely use tartar-control dentifrices and mouthrinses.
TI  - Characteristics of accumulation of oral gram-positive bacteria on mucin-conditioned glass surfaces in a model system.
AB  - Strains of Streptococcus, Actinomyces and Lactobacillus were grown on glass surfaces in semi-defined medium (pH 7.0) with mucin, at a dilution rate of D = 0.1 h-1, in a modified chemostat. The accumulation of cells followed four phases. In phase 1 (0-1 h), cells did not divide on the surfaces and adhesion accounted for rapid accumulation. Phase 2 (1-4 h) comprised adhesion and cell division, and accumulation slowed, cell number doubling times (Cdt) Streptococcus, 2.7 h to 8.6 h, Actinomyces, 2.3 h to 7.5 h and Lactobacillus, 3.6 h to 3.8 h. Cell division on surfaces accounted for accumulation in phase 3 (4 h to 12 h): Cdt Streptococcus, 1.7 h to 5.2 h, Actinomyces, 2.4 h to 7.5 h and Lactobacillus, 2.2 h to 7.2 h. The biofilm stabilized in Phase 4, Cdt 18.5 h to 90.2 h. The numbers (10(6) colony-forming units per cm2) of cells in stable biofilms were Streptococcus, 4.02 to 5.12, Actinomyces, 12.5 and 34.0 and Lactobacillus, 2.77. Accumulation increased (Cdt 0.9 h-2.7 h) when cells were exposed to glucose excess or high dilution rates and phase 2 of accumulation did not occur.
TI  - Conservation of salivary glycoprotein-interacting and human immunoglobulin G-cross-reactive domains of antigen I/II in oral streptococci.
AB  - In this study we localized more precisely the salivary glycoprotein-interacting and the human immunoglobulin G (hIgG)-cross-reacting domains on the SR molecule, an antigen I/II-related protein from S. mutans serotype f. Mapping of the SR molecule with polypeptides expressed by subclones covering the entire molecule and with synthetic peptides demonstrates that the salivary glycoprotein-binding domain is located in the N-terminal alanine-rich repeats of the SR molecule. In order to investigate the degree of conservation of both regions in various oral streptococci, we tested the reactivity of 8 representative strains of the mutans group and 11 nonmutans oral Streptococcus strains (S. anginosus, S. milleri, S. constellatus, S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. sanguis, S. gordonii, S. salivarius, and S. mitis strains) with antipeptide antibodies in a whole-cell enzyme linked immunosorbent assay together with colony hybridization analysis using DNA probes designed to map these two regions. All the mutans group strains except S. rattus and the 11 nonmutans streptococcal strains showed a high conservation of the C-terminal part of the SR molecule, especially the hIgG-cross-reacting domain, and less homology for the N-terminal salivary glycoprotein-binding region. Almost all of the sera from patients with rheumatic disease reacted strongly with SR from S. mutans serotype f, P1 from S. mutans serotype c, and four peptides located in the hIgG-cross-reacting region and not with peptides located at the C and N termini and in the proline-rich repeats. These results confirm that epitopes located within this region are immunogenic in humans and could lead to the synthesis of natural anti-IgG antibodies.
TI  - Effect of chlorhexidine varnish on streptococci in dental plaque from occlusal fissures.
AB  - The treatment of tooth surfaces with chlorhexidine varnish may lead to long-lasting suppression of mutants streptococci in dental plaque. Microbiological observations following varnish treatment suggest that this prolonged suppression might be caused by bacterial interference. To investigate whether physiologically related organisms, such as other Streptococcus species, compete with mutans streptococci in the ecosystem, we have analyzed streptococcal populations on the tooth surface before and after chlorhexidine varnish treatment. Occlusal surfaces with high numbers of mutans streptococci were selected in human volunteers and treated with chlorhexidine varnish. Analyses of sequentially collected plaque samples confirmed that S. oralis-group streptococci returned to baseline levels shortly after the chlorhexidine application, while Actinomyces naeslundii populations reached prestudy or even higher levels only several days after treatment. Mutans streptococci, however, were below the detection level in the 14-day samples, except in 1 individual. The pattern of recolonization by individual Streptococcus species after chlorhexidine application closely resembled that of cleaned enamel surfaces: S. oralis and S. sanguis were primary colonizers while S. gordonii became dominant at a later stage. It is concluded that after intensive chlorhexidine treatment, a normal oral microflora reestablished, characterized by low proportions of mutans streptococci.
TI  - A quantitative comparison of selected bacteria in human carious dentine by microscopic counts.
AB  - The levels of selected cariogenic and obligately anaerobic bacteria have been compared in carious dentine taken from fissures, smooth surfaces, and root surfaces. The numbers of infected dentinal tubules were determined by immunohistological staining using species-specific antisera against selected bacteria. Selective localization was observed; mutans streptococci were the predominant bacteria in dentine from fissures and smooth surface coronal caries, but not from root surface caries. The proportion of mutans streptococci was higher in the shallow and middle layers of dentine from fissures and smooth surface coronal carious lesions than from the deep layers. In root surface caries, Actinomyces spp. were the predominant bacteria, and were present at higher levels in the deep layer of root lesions than in the shallow and middle layers. The proportion of Lactobacillus spp. was relatively low despite its high detection frequency in all layers of the three types of carious lesion. Immunohistological staining with species-specific antisera was able to reveal the distribution and the localization of various bacteria in carious dentine.
TI  - Effects of subinhibitory concentrations of chemical agents on hydrophobicity and  in vitro adherence of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - The aim of this investigation was to determine whether sublethal concentrations of chlorhexidine (Cx), hexetidine (Hx), cetylpyridinium chloride (Cc), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), sanguinarine (Sg), sodium fluoride (NaF), and ammonium fluoride (NH4F) could affect hydrophobicity and adhesion of Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mutans to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (S-HA). Determination of the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) showed that both species were susceptible to all agents tested. Growth in the presence of sub-MIC concentrations of Cx, SDS, Cc, NaF, or NH4F did not change significantly the hydrophobicity of S. sanguis cells when compared to the control which lacked any agent. However, growth in the presence of Hx or Sg resulted in a significant reduction in their hydrophobicity. Sub-MIC levels of SDS or Sg in the growth medium resulted in S. mutans cells with increased affinity for hexadecane compared with the control. The adherence of S. sanguis was changed significantly only by Hx or Sg, resulting in less cells adhering to S-HA. However, S. mutans cells previously incubated with NaF, NH4F, or Sg showed a higher adherence to S-HA than the control. The mechanisms of interference with adherence are at present not completely understood. Thus, antimicrobial agents at sub-MIC concentrations can interfere selectively with hydrophobicity and/or adhesion of oral streptococci.
TI  - A microbiological study of recurrent dentinal caries.
AB  - A cross-sectional microbiological study of recurrent (secondary) dentinal caries  was conducted. Freshly extracted human teeth containing amalgam restorations judged to be clinically intact were scrubbed with chlorhexidine soap and soaked in povidone-iodine solution. The teeth were then split to remove the fillings and examined for dentinal caries. Of 54 teeth examined, 22 (40%) were free of dentinal caries in the restored site. The remainder were assigned to arbitrary groups of questionable (15), initial (8) and active caries (9), based on the amount of dentinal decay observed. Comparison of pre-extraction bite-wing radiographs with the in situ findings revealed the sensitivity for secondary caries detection to be only about 50%. In contrast, the specificity for absence of caries was 73%. There was considerable variation in the numbers and types of micro-organisms found in dentine samples from lesions of comparable severity. Facultatively, anaerobic streptococci were the most numerous and most prevalent micro-organisms in the affected dentine, but no single species was significantly associated with recurrent caries. Mutans streptococci were found in 40% of sites with any degree of caries and in only 3 of the 9 sites with the most caries. Homofermentative lactobacilli were present in 18 of the 54 dentine samples, including 4 from caries-free sites. While the prevalence and numbers of lactobacilli increased with the degree of caries, they occurred in less than half of the affected dentine samples. Actinomyces occurred in 15 of 32 affected sites but only in 2 of the 9 most active sites. Their numbers never exceeded 3 x 10(3) CFU/mg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Low surface tension calcium hydroxide solution is an effective antiseptic.
AB  - The antimicrobial effects of a saturated calcium hydroxide solution, and in combination with 10% and 20% detergent, were evaluated on Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Neisseria sp., diphtheroid, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus sp., Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis and Candida albicans. The saturated calcium hydroxide solution was effective against only four of the 11 microorganisms studied over a 60-min exposure time. The calcium hydroxide solutions containing detergent killed all 11 test organisms over a 30-min exposure time. This difference was statistically significant (P < 0.01). No statistically significant difference in antimicrobial action was found between the 10% and 20% detergent calcium hydroxide solutions (P > 0.01). However, the low surface tension (46.5 x 10(-3) Nm-1) and high pH (10.8) of the calcium hydroxide solution with 20% detergent establish it as the more effective solution.
TI  - Interaction of the salivary glycoprotein EP-GP with the bacterium Streptococcus salivarius HB.
AB  - The interaction of the human salivary glycoprotein EP-GP with a number of oral bacterial species, following incubation with human whole saliva, has been investigated. EP-GP could be detected with a specific monoclonal antibody, by means of ELISA or by electrophoresis in combination with Western Transfer. The results indicated that EP-GP is bound only by Streptococcus salivarius, and not by the other tested strains of bacteria, Actinomyces viscosus, A. naeslundii, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides fragilis, S. gordonii, S. oralis, S. sanguis, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. sobrinus, S. rattus, S. constellatus, and S. anginosus. Binding of EP-GP to S. salivarius is mediated by a protein-protein interaction, which was found to be pH-dependent with a maximum binding between pH 5 and 6. For further characterization of the binding of EP-GP to S. salivarius, four mutants were tested, each of them lacking different cell wall antigens. EP-GP was bound to all mutants in amounts comparable with the wildtype, in spite of the different surface antigen compositions. We were able to identify a 27-kD EP-GP binding protein, by extraction of S. salivarius-cell wall antigens and electrophoretic techniques. In addition to EP-GP, S. salivarius also bound two other salivary proteins, namely, secretory IgA and low-molecular-weight mucin (MG-2).
TI  - Grouping of oral streptococcal species using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy in comparison with classical microbiological identification.
AB  - The grouping and identification made by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) of 40 oral streptococcal strains was compared with their known taxonomic positions. Grouping was obtained by cluster analysis on the spectral distances between the first derivative spectra of the strains. Spectra were divided into five spectral 'windows' and cluster analysis was either on either a combination of all five windows or on a selected window. The oral streptococci were divided into two main clusters, mutans streptococci and other streptococci. This division was based mainly on the spectral information contained in the window between 1300-900 cm-1, indicative of polysaccharide and phosphate-carrying compounds. In the grouping based on the entire spectrum, species clusters could be observed for Streptococcus crista, Strep. salivarius and Strep. rattus. A few strains were placed in wrong clusters because of intra-strain variance. It is concluded that the grouping of these oral streptococcal species was good and similar to the classical taxonomy and that FT-IR might develop into a new identification method for oral streptococci.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of eight dental cements.
AB  - The antibacterial action of a light-cured glass polyalkenoate Vitrebond and an adhesive resin luting agent Panavia Ex was investigated and compared with six previously tested dental cements. The bacterial cultures used were six strains of Streptococcus mutans, six of Streptococcus sanguis and six cultures of carious debris from carious lesions. A modification of the agar diffusion method was used to test the antibacterial action of freshly mixed cements. In addition the cements were allowed to set and their antimicrobial action was tested by incubation for 5 days in sucrose broth inoculated with the test cultures. All the freshly mixed materials had an antibacterial action. A two-way analysis of variance and Tukey-Student range analysis showed that Vitrebond had a significantly greater zone of inhibition than Aquacem, IRM, Dycal, Dycal VLC, Ceramco and GC Elite (P = 0.001). Freshly mixed Panavia Ex exhibited minimal antibacterial action. After 5 days the antibacterial properties of all the cements were reduced.
TI  - Antibacterial effectiveness of dentin bonding systems.
AB  - This study examined the antibacterial activities of several commercially available glass ionomer cements, dentin bonding systems and luting agents by employing both agar plate diffusion (APD) and growth inhibition (GI) methods. Amalgam and resin composites were also tested as control materials. In both methods (APD and GI), cylindrical specimens were used. Four bacteria strains were tested: Streptococcus mutans, S. salivarius, S. mitis and S. sanguis. These studies were performed using standardized innoculums with selective media, and the assayed materials were directly applied on the assay cultures and plates. The results of agar plate assay were in accordance with the results of growth inhibition method. The glass ionomer cements showed marked antibacterial activity. On the contrary, amalgam, composites, luting agents and dentinal bonding systems did not affect bacterial growth. The sensitivity of the growth method showed that all the strains were inhibited in the same way by each inhibitory material. The data suggest that the use of glass ionomer cements as cavity liners/bases may reduce the consequences of microleakage due to its antibacterial properties.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity of Prevention mouthrinse.
AB  - Prevention mouthrinse was designed to serve as a vital supplement to normal oral  hygiene procedures. To determine the antimicrobial potency of this mouthrinse, minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs), bactericidal kinetics, and short-term exposure studies were conducted. A spectrum of oral microorganisms was employed in this investigation: Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces viscosus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eikenella corrodens, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Serratia marcescens and Candida albicans. Microorganisms were cultured in standard enriched media and under appropriate atmospheric conditions. Inhibition assays were conducted in tubes, with each mouthrinse dilution assayed in triplicate. MIC determinations revealed that all of the microorganisms studied were highly susceptible to Prevention mouthrinse, with MICs ranging from 16-fold to 128-fold dilutions. Bactericidal kinetics assays showed rapid killing of the test organisms in the presence of the mouthrinse. Brief (5-minute) exposure of S. mutans to 8-fold diluted mouthrinse resulted in a substantial delay in growth. Under the constraints of this type of study, Prevention mouthrinse exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against all of the microorganisms studied. We support the notion that Prevention mouthrinse may be a valuable supplement to normal oral hygiene procedures. A 6-month clinical trial assessing the in vivo efficacy of Prevention mouthrinse is currently being conducted.
TI  - Glucose stimulates cAMP accumulation in the oral bacterium Actinomyces viscosus.
AB  - Actinomyces viscosus T14V, a Gram-positive bacterium found in the oral cavity, was found to be insensitive to glucose-mediated catabolite repression. Basal levels of beta-galactosidase (18-26 U) were observed at all phases of growth regardless of the culture conditions. Further, beta-galactosidase could not be induced with lactose, or with a known inducer of the enzyme, isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside, or with dibutyryl cAMP. Glucose, on the other hand, stimulated cAMP accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner. Fructose and sucrose mimicked the effects of glucose on cAMP accumulation, whereas galactose, mannose and maltose had lesser stimulatory effects. Other carbon sources, i.e., lactose, alpha-methylglucoside, ribose, xylose and succinate were without effect. Glucose and alpha-methylglucoside were found to stimulate cAMP accumulation in toluene-permeabilized cells, in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, theophylline. Glucose did not stimulate cAMP levels in other Gram-positive bacteria including Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis and S. salivarius but did cause cAMP accumulation in other strains of A. viscosus. The results suggest that glucose effects on cAMP metabolism are independent of the induction of beta-galactosidase as presently defined for Escherichia coli, and that the effects appear to be selective to the A. viscosus bacteria. The results also suggest that glucose stimulates cAMP accumulation via activation of adenylate cyclase.
TI  - Cytotoxic and antibacterial effects of orthodontic appliances.
AB  - The cytotoxic and antibacterial effects of orthodontic appliances were assessed.  Metallic devices used in orthodontics, such as molar bands, brackets, and archwires were tested by the agar overlay cytotoxicity test with mouse fibroblast cells. The same devices were tested for antibacterial effect with Streptococcus mutans and S. sanguis. The multicomponent devices, which are bonded with silver- and copper-based brazing alloys, were more cytotoxic than the single-component devices, probably because copper is more cytotoxic than nickel. The devices had a definite, but low, antibacterial effect, as compared with the 0.05% chlorhexidine positive control. A cytotoxic effect of the devices per se might contribute to a localized gingivitis. It is uncertain whether orthodontic devices have any significant inhibitory effect on dental plaque viability.
TI  - A simple method for monitoring mutans streptococci in margins of restorations.
AB  - Plaque material collected from margins of restorations using a sharp toothpick was streaked across one and the same plastic strip from a commercially available test kit and inoculated in a liquid medium containing bacitracin. The reproducibility of the method was good. The method is simple, inexpensive and suitable for the chairside demonstration of the colonization of mutans streptococci in localized areas of the mouth, such as margins of restorations.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of dentinal bonding agents.
AB  - The susceptibility of five bacterial species to seven dentinal bonding agents was examined in vitro. Agar diffusion tests using filterpaper disks containing 10 microL each of conditioner, primer, or resin were performed on blood agar and mitis salivarius bacitracin agar. Chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as a positive control. After incubation, zones of inhibited bacterial growth were measured. Of all the compounds tested, Gluma cleanser and Gluma etchant showed the strongest growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. No antibacterial effect was noted for Prisma Universal Bond 2 and Superlux Universal Bond 2 systems. The primers of Gluma, Denthesive, and Scotchbond 2 displayed antibacterial activity that, in some cases, was comparable to that of 0.2% chlorhexidine. Zones of inhibition were seen for the resin materials of Scotchbond 2 and Tripton with Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis and Actinomyces viscosus. No inhibition was seen after these resins were cured, whereas the antibacterial effect of XR-Bond on S sanguis and A viscosus was not affected by light curing.
TI  - Transmission of mutans streptococci to infants following short term application of an iodine-NaF solution to mothers' dentition.
AB  - In a randomized clinical trial, six applications of an I2-NaF or a placebo solution were administered to the mothers' dentition at the time of tooth emergence of her infant, to evaluate its effect on transmission of mutans streptococci (MS) to the infant. MS and other bacterial levels were periodically monitored in 48 mother-infant pairs until the child's third birthday. There were significant reductions in maternal salivary MS (P = 0.04), lactobacilli (P = 0.04), total streptococci (P = 0.002), and total cultivable organisms (P = 0.004) immediately following treatment. In children, 3-yr incidence of MS colonization and the time of acquisition of MS or the caries experience did not differ significantly between the two groups. We conclude that short-term application of I2-NaF to the maternal dentition of predentate infants significantly lowers MS, lactobacilli, total streptococci, and total cultivable bacteria in mothers' saliva, but does not influence the incidence and the time of acquisition of MS or the caries experience in children.
TI  - Differential expression of salivary mucin bacterial aggregating activity with caries status.
AB  - 1. The low and high mol. wt mucin forms were isolated from saliva of caries-resistant (CR) and caries-susceptible (CS) individuals, and assessed for their bacterial aggregating potential towards S. mutans and S. sanguis, the common cariogenic microorganisms encountered in the oral cavity. 2. The high mol. wt mucin from both groups of subjects exhibited similar protein and carbohydrate content, but the level of covalently bound fatty acids was significantly lower in the CR group. The mucin from CR group showed only a weak inhibitory potential, and no inhibitory activity was observed with the mucin of CS group. 3. The low mol. wt mucins from both groups, while displaying compositional similarities, showed a marked variation in the bacterial aggregating activity. With both bacteria, the activity of the mucin from CR group was at least 128-fold greater than that of CS group. 4. The conversion of the high mol. wt mucin to a low mol. wt form through the action of salivary protease produced in both groups enhancement in mucin's bacterial aggregating capacity. This enhancement was, however, considerably less pronounced in the case of mucin from CS group. 5. The results for the first time demonstrate that the bacterial aggregating epitope of salivary mucins is expressed to a greater extent in CR individuals, and that this epitope is apparently more accessible to bacteria in the low mol. wt mucin form.
TI  - Longitudinal study of relations between human salivary antimicrobial proteins and measures of dental plaque accumulation and composition.
AB  - Many studies have attempted to relate levels of antimicrobial proteins in saliva  to oral health; results have been inconsistent, and one reason might be inconsistency of measures of plaque and saliva within subjects. This study investigated associations between plaque and salivary variables in longitudinal data. Whole saliva, and 8-h plaque pooled from buccal first permanent molars, was obtained from 32 dental students on Tuesdays from 3:00-6:00 p.m. over 4 weeks. Salivary flow rate was determined, and samples were assayed for lysozyme, lactoferrin, total peroxidase, myeloperoxidase, OSCN-, sIgA and total protein. Colonies on mitis-salivarius agar were assigned to Streptococcus sanguis, Strep. mutans or Strep. salivarius on the basis of morphology, supplemented by the API Rapid Strep identification system. Consistency of values within subjects across weeks was evaluated by repeat-measures analysis of variance and intraclass correlation; data were transformed to reduce skewness. Pearson's r was used to determine associations between plaque and salivary variables. Significant intraclass correlations (alpha = 0.05) were found for all salivary variables except myeloperoxidase, and for total flora, total streptococci, Strep. sanguis and Strep. sanguis as a proportion of total streptococci. Significant Pearson correlations with Strep. sanguis as a proportion of total streptococci were found for total protein (r = -0.24), sIgA (r = -0.22), lactoferrin (r = -0.19) and OSCN- (r = 0.20) when data from all weeks were pooled (n = 128). Strep. sanguis proportions tended to be low in subjects with high values for salivary proteins; the range of proportions was wider in subjects with low salivary values. These findings suggest some consistency of weekly values for many plaque and salivary variables. They also support previous cross-sectional data which suggested that salivary antimicrobial proteins may have some effect on plaque composition. This study was made before recent revisions in streptococcal taxonomy, and further research is needed to clarify interactions of salivary proteins with currently defined species.
TI  - Targeting and delivery of bactericide to adsorbed oral bacteria by use of proteoliposomes.
AB  - Proteoliposomes having surface-bound succinylated concanavalin A (s-conA) have been prepared from a range of phospholipid mixtures by sonication (SUV) and reverse phase evaporation (REV) covering a range of size (weight-average diameter (dw)) from approx. 35 to 310 nm and weight-average number of protein molecules per liposomes (Pw) from approx. 50 to 3000. The targeting of the proteoliposomes to adsorbed biofilms of the bacteria Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mutans has been assessed from the extent of inhibition of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for bacterial cell surface antigens. The surface-bound lectin enhances targeting relative to 'naked' liposomes of comparable concentration by factors of 2-50 depending on the liposomal lipid composition and Pw. The effect of the bactericide Triclosan on the thermal properties and permeability characteristics of liposomes has been studied. At and above a molar ratio of Triclosan to lipid of 0.6, Triclosan eliminates the gel to liquid-crystalline phase transition in dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) containing liposomes and increases the bilayer permeability of both liposomes and proteoliposomes to D-glucose. The proteoliposomes have been used to deliver Triclosan to S. sanguis biofilms and the inhibition of growth of the bacteria after treatment with liposomally delivered Triclosan has been determined using a microtitre plate re-growth assay and compared with growth inhibition by 'free' Triclosan. It is shown that for short exposure times (1 to 2 min) proteoliposomally delivered Triclosan is a more effective growth inhibitor than free Triclosan. The results are discussed in terms of the targeting, retention and subsequent release of Triclosan into the bacterial biofilms.
TI  - Xylitol and the bactericidal effect of chlorhexidine and fluoride on Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - The present study was made to investigate the effect of xylitol on the bactericidal and bacteriostatic action of chlorohexidine diacetate (CHX) and sodium fluoride (F) in ATCC strains of Streptococcus mutans and S. sanguis. Standardized bacterial cell suspensions were used in tests for bactericidal effect and for inhibition of growth and sucrose fermentation. The results showed no interference of xylitol with the antibacterial effect of CHX and F combinations. Xylitol did not show any additive effect either but appeared inert in the combinations used.
TI  - Agglutination of Streptococcus mutans serotype C cells but inhibition of Porphyromonas gingivalis autoaggregation by human lactoferrin.
AB  - The ability of various forms of human lactoferrin (LF) to agglutinate oral Streptococcus mutans, Strep. sobrinus, Strep. rattus, Strep. sanguis, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans cells was studied spectrophotometrically. Fe3+ saturated LF was unable to agglutinate these bacteria, whereas iron-free LF (apo LF) effectively agglutinated Strep. mutans cells but not the other bacteria. The efficiency and rate of agglutination of Strep. mutans were somewhat lower with apo LF than with human whole saliva. However, secretory IgA, phosphate and whole saliva almost totally abolished the apo LF-mediated agglutination of Strep. mutans, suggesting binding to the same target sites on bacterial cell surfaces, or to each other. The presence of exogenous iron (Fe2+, Fe3+), lactoperoxidase or serum albumin did not affect the agglutination by apo LF. Low Ca2+ (50-100 microns) slightly enhanced the agglutination by apo LF but higher concentrations (0.5-1.0 mM) totally blocked the apo LF-mediated agglutination of Strep. mutans. Both saliva and apo LF significantly delayed the rapid autoaggregation of P. gingivalis cells. Aggregation of P. gingivalis is considered a potential virulence factor and a protective mechanism against the host's cellular defences in the gingival crevice. These findings show a novel, strain-specific antibacterial mechanism for LF against Strep. mutans and P. gingivalis and adds a new compound to the group of agglutinating proteins in human saliva.
TI  - An analysis of the subgingival microflora in randomly selected subjects.
AB  - The aim of this study was to describe the presence of some microbial species in the subgingival microflora of a randomly selected subject sample. A further objective was to analyze the association between some microbiological characteristics and the periodontal conditions of the subjects. A total of 171 individuals aged 30-65 years were included. A pooled subgingival plaque sample was obtained from the mesial aspect of the 6 Ramfjord teeth by the use of the paper-point method. The samples were processed and analyzed according to standardized procedures. The periodontal condition of the subjects was examined clinically and included assessment of plaque, gingivitis, probing pocket depth and probing attachment level. The results showed that 81% of the subjects were positive for Campylobacter rectus, 80% for Fusobacterium nucleatum, 77% for Streptococcus sanguis, 72% for Streptococcus mitis, 66% for Eikenella corrodens, 58% for Prevotella intermedia, 32% for Capnocytophaga, 27% for Selenomonas, 25% for Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 14% for Porphyromonas gingivalis and 13% for Streptococcus mutans. Small differences in the periodontal conditions were observed between subjects harboring P. gingivalis, A. actinomytecomitans or > 5% P. intermedia and the rest of the sample. Similarly small differences in the clinical parameters were revealed when the subjects were grouped according to proportions of disease-associated and health-associated species in their subgingival samples.
TI  - The dental status and attitudes of patients at risk from infective endocarditis.
AB  - Infective endocarditis represents one of the few potentially fatal infections that may be caused in the patient by a dentist. Efforts to reduce the incidence of this disease usually take the form of appropriate antibiotic cover prior to dental treatment, together with the establishment and maintenance of good oral health. This paper is a report of a survey on the dental health and awareness of 81 'at-risk' patients attending a cardiology outpatient clinic. It was found that whilst the patients were apparently well motivated and well informed, a high prevalence of periodontal disease existed in the group. It is concluded that when patients are diagnosed with a cardiac disorder which predisposes to infective endocarditis they should have a dental examination as soon as possible, preferably by a dentist experienced in the treatment of patients with special needs.
TI  - pH changes in human dental plaque from lactose and milk before and after adaptation.
AB  - pH changes in human dental plaque in vivo from lactose and milk have been studied in four separate mouthrinse experiments. (1) pH was measured in plaque samples of 12 subjects before and after 6 weeks of frequent daily mouthrinsing with 10% lactose. The pH decreases were significantly more pronounced after the adaptation period than before (p < 0.001), 4 of the 12 subjects showing about the same low plaque pH from lactose as from glucose. (2) Similar to the previous experiment, frequent daily mouthrinsing with low-fat bovine milk in 10 subjects resulted in more pronounced pH decreases in plaque after an adaptation period of 4 weeks (p < 0.001). (3) Single mouthrinses, without any prior adaptation, with bovine standard milk, human breast milk, lactose-hydrolysed bovine standard milk, 5% lactose and 5% sucrose were compared regarding the effect on plaque pH in 7 subjects. All solutions resulted in pH falls. The most pronounced were found with sucrose, followed by the lactose-hydrolysed milk. (4) Bovine standard milk, 5% lactose and 10% sucrose were compared after a single mouthrinse in 5 subjects using interdental plaque pH wire telemetry. Lactose and milk were fermented more slowly than sucrose. In a separate study, acid production from lactose was also measured in two oral strains each of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus sanguis. The results from these experiments indicated that at least part of the lactose transport and catabolism in all studied streptococcus strains seems to be regulated by inducible enzymes.
TI  - Mixed continuous cultures of Streptococcus mutans with Streptococcus sanguis or with Streptococcus oralis as a model to study the ecological effects of the lactoperoxidase system.
AB  - Mixed continuous cultures of Streptococcus species were obtained, using complex carbohydrate (mucin) as a source of nutrients, to study the ecological effects of oxygen and the lactoperoxidase system. S. mutans NCTC 10449 was unable to grow as a pure culture on mucin, but attained a significant population size in the presence of S. oralis and S. sanguis strains. The cell densities of the anaerobic mixed cultures decreased when oxygen was supplied, and S. mutans was more suppressed by oxygen than were S. sanguis and S. oralis. However, the concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (30 mumol/l in the mixed culture of S. mutans with S. sanguis and 640 mumol/l in the culture with S. oralis) indicated a certain resistance of the organisms to hydrogen peroxide. Addition of lactoperoxidase and thiocyanate to the oxygen-supplied cultures had a differential effect on the streptococcal populations. While S. mutans was inhibited, and even disappeared in the culture with S. oralis, the growth of S. sanguis and S. oralis was unaffected. This latter observation was in accordance with the OSCN- reductase activities of these organisms. When hydrogen peroxide was also added together with lactoperoxidase and thiocyanate, a further inhibition of S. mutans in the culture with S. sanguis was observed. Under these conditions, S. oralis was also inhibited, perhaps by the strong accumulation of OSCN-, exceeding the capacity of the OSCN- reductase. The effects of lactoperoxidase on mixed cultures may reflect the situation in the mouth.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - A quantitative study of calcium binding and aggregation in selected oral bacteria.
AB  - By means of micro-equilibrium dialysis, calcium binding capacities and affinities were measured in three different oral bacteria, and the effects of extracellular polysaccharide, pH, and aggregation were investigated. Binding capacities of 31.0 +/- 2.1 (C. matruchotii), 34.7 +/- 3.7 (S. sanguis), and 41.5 +/- 5.4 (S. downei) mumol calcium/g wet weight of cells were found at pH 7.0, falling to 21.4 +/- 0.8 mumol calcium/g wet wt. cells at pH 5.0 for S. downei. Dissociation constants were found to vary between 0.78 +/- 0.24 and 1.77 +/- 0.30 mmol/L (at pH 7.0, depending on species), and between 0.62 +/- 0.04 and 1.77 +/- 0.30 (in the pH range 5.0 to 7.0, for S. downei only). Examination suggested that at pH 7.0 calcium-facilitated bacterial association occurs in the streptococci with calcium uptake curves analogous with those of positively cooperative systems. Desorption of calcium from aggregated S. downei suggested that the mechanism of desorption differed from that of uptake. This may be an important factor in plaque formation and in the binding of cells to the surface of formed plaque. Plaque calcium forms a reservoir, readily released by a pH drop, which may increase plaque fluid saturation and reduce demineralization.
TI  - Distribution and isolation frequency of eight streptococcal species in saliva from predentate and dentate children and adults.
AB  - The isolation frequency and distribution of eight recently defined streptococcal  species have been investigated in the saliva of adults and that of both predentate and dentate children. The effects of frequency of sugar intake and tooth presence on the distribution of streptococcal species were also analyzed. Saliva samples were collected from 121 subjects divided into three study groups: (a) 56 predentate children (predentate group), (b) 37 dentate children (dentate group), and (c) 28 adults (adult group). Up to 17 biochemical and enzymatic tests were used to categorize streptococcal isolates into S. mitis, S. oralis, S. salivarius, S. anginosus, S. sanguis, S. vestibularis, S. mutans, and S. gordonii. The mean total and streptococcal salivary colony-forming units (CFU) were lowest in the predentate group and highest in the adult group. Streptococci were found in all the study subjects, and there was no obvious relationship between the total or streptococcal CFU and the number of teeth or the frequency of sugar intake. There was a wide variation in the isolation frequency of streptococcal species in the three study groups. S. mitis, S. oralis, and S. salivarius were the most frequent species isolated, and together they comprised 83% of the total streptococcal isolates. In contrast to studies using older classifications, S. sanguis was a minor species in the saliva though found more often in adults than in children (p < 0.04). S. anginosus was a minor species found in about 10% of adults and children. S. gordonii was detected rarely and only in dentate subjects. S. mutans was detected only in dentate subjects, significantly greater in adults (57.1%) than in children (5.4%, p < 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - The effects of triclosan and zinc citrate, alone and in combination, on a community of oral bacteria grown in vitro.
AB  - A mixed-culture chemostat system has been used as a more stringent laboratory system for evaluation of the antimicrobial effects of Triclosan and zinc citrate. The inhibitors were added alone, and in combination, as a pulse (a high initial inhibitor concentration which decreased with time) or as a dose (concentration of inhibitor increased with time) to give maximum concentrations of 34.5 mumol/L Triclosan and 39.8 mumol/L zinc citrate. When dosed, Triclosan inhibited A. viscosus and all five Gram-negative species, whereas zinc citrate had less effect, probably due to complexation by media components. Similar effects were seen when Triclosan was pulsed, except that S. mutans was the most sensitive Gram-positive species and V. dispar was unaffected. However, when the inhibitors were dosed or pulsed in combination, marked complementary and additive inhibitory effects were observed, particularly against Gram-negative species, although S. gordonii and S. oralis were relatively unaffected. The data confirm that increased effects can be obtained with suitable combinations of antimicrobial agents and suggest that, under certain conditions, apparently broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents may be acting more selectively than hitherto suspected.
TI  - Emergence of immune competence in saliva.
AB  - Saliva contains essentially no IgA at birth. However, secretory immune responses  to oral and non-oral microbial antigens emerge early in life. We have investigated the characteristics of these responses in salivas of infants less than 1 month through 4 years of age, using cross-sectional and longitudinal approaches. Antibody specificities (IgA, IgA1, and IgA2) were measured in ELISA and Western blot analysis to antigens of Streptococcus mitis and S. salivarius that colonize during the neonatal period. Antibodies reactive with S. sanguis and mutans streptococci, which colonize later in the infant's life, were also determined. Concurrent investigation of the oral flora of each infant was performed and related to the observed antibody specificities. The secretory nature of the immunoglobulins in these salivas was analyzed immunologically and chromatographically. The primary molecular form of salivary IgA was dimeric in all salivas tested. Both IgA subclasses were found, although a subset of infant salivas initially contained > 90% IgA1. IgM (> 1 microgram/ml) was detected in 58% of 3- to 17-week-old infants. By 2 months of age, salivas from most infants contained IgA antibody reactive with at least two S. mitis components. Many salivas also contained antibody reactive with S. salivarius components. By the end of the first year, most salivas contained IgA1 and IgA2 antibody to S. mitis antigens. Maturation of secretory responses in the second and third year was evidenced by the appearance of increased concentrations and additional specificities of salivary IgA antibodies to S. mitis antigens. Antibody to S. mitis, S. salivarius, and S. sanguis extracellular components was detected only after infection with the respective species.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Phenotypic characterization of oral streptococci by classical methods.
AB  - The phenotypic characteristics of 215 strains of oral streptococci were compared  on the basis of the results of sorbitol, raffinose and trehalose fermentation, ammonium from arginine production, aesculin hydrolysis, H2O2 production, susceptibility to 2 U bacitracin, and growth in 4% NaCl solution. Eleven different species were identified. Among the most noteworthy findings were the low number of H2O2-producing strains of Streptococcus sobrinus, the effective discrimination between Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mitis on the basis of raffinose fermentation, and the phenotypic similarity between Streptococcus oralis and the former mutans group. To avoid the creation of new species, the term biotype is proposed to designate phenotypically distinct organisms which do not qualify as different species.
TI  - The effect of glass-ionomer cement on carious dentine: an in vivo study.
AB  - The effect of a glass-ionomer cement sealant on carious dentine was investigated  clinically and bacteriologically. The study group consisted of 24 molar teeth, with small clinical visible occlusal dentine lesions, in 13 children (aged 7-18 years). Twenty of these molars were filled and sealed with a glass-ionomer cement (Fuji Ionomer Type III) and 4 with a resin sealant (Delton). From each molar, two dentine samples were collected aseptically with a time interval of 7 months. The first sample was taken after opening the lesion just beneath the dentino-enamel junction before application of the filling material (sample A), and the second beneath the removed filling material (sample B) 7 months later. Before collecting sample B the sealant was clinically evaluated and impressions were prepared in order to (re)evaluate the sealants later by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). After taking the second sample, the remaining fissures were opened to a standard depth, the caries which was still present was removed, and a composite resin restoration was applied. In all teeth, more glass-ionomer cement material was found by SEM compared to the clinical evaluation. In both the glass-ionomer- and the resin sealant-treated group, the median value of the total number of microorganisms (CFU) on blood agar was 100 times smaller in the B sample. Microorganisms were found in 90% of the B samples in the group treated with glass-ionomer cement; hard dentine was also found in 45% of the B samples from this group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Physico-chemical and structural properties of the surfaces of Peptostreptococcus  micros and Streptococcus mitis as compared to those of mutans streptococci, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus salivarius.
AB  - The surface properties of nine Streptococcus mitis and four Peptostreptococcus micros strains from the oral cavity were examined and compared with a large group of oral streptococci. Zeta potential and contact angle measurements were employed to determine physico-chemical cell surface properties. In addition, elemental surface concentration ratios were obtained via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and surface structures were examined with transmission electron microscopy. The S. mitis and P. micros strains were found to have higher isoelectric points, higher hydrophobicities and higher N/C surface concentration ratios than some other oral streptococci. The combined data suggest that both species possess large amounts of surface protein. All the S. mitis strains displayed abundant surface fibrils in negative staining, but the P. micros strains were devoid of surface appendages indicating that surface protein is present in different forms in the two species. The surfaces of S. mitis and P. micros type strains differed significantly from the other strains examined.
TI  - Serum antibody responses to Streptococcus mutans antigens in humans systemically  infected with oral streptococci.
AB  - Sera from patients with subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE) due to Streptococcus mutans or other oral streptococci and from normal subjects were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for antibodies to defined S. mutans antigens. Antibodies of IgG and IgA isotypes to Ag I/II and Ag III were greatly elevated in S. mutans-SBE sera, and the IgA antibodies in 3 sera included both polymeric and monomeric forms. Elevated IgM and IgG anti-lipoteichoic acid and IgG and IgA anti-serotype c polysaccharide antibodies were also found. The sera of 4 of 6 patients infected with other oral streptococci also displayed antibodies to S. mutans Ag I/II. Sera of 3 patients infected with Streptococcus mitis or Streptococcus oralis, but none of the S. mutans-infected cases, showed elevated antibodies to human heart sarcolemma, and all SBE sera had elevated rheumatoid factor. These results suggest that the known surface protein antigens of S. mutans are immunodominant in humans, and are not likely to be heart cross-reactive.
TI  - Expression of salivary mucin bacterial aggregating activity: difference with caries.
AB  - The low and high molecular weight mucin forms were isolated from saliva of individuals with different caries status and assessed for their bacterial aggregating potential towards S. mutans and S. sanguis. The high molecular weight mucin from both groups exhibited similar protein and carbohydrate content, but the level of covalently bound fatty acids was lower in the caries-resistant group. The mucin from caries-resistant group showed only a weak inhibitory potential, while no inhibitory activity was observed with the mucin of caries-susceptible group. The low molecular weight mucins from both groups, while displaying compositional similarities, showed a marked variation in the bacterial aggregating activity, and the titer of the mucin from caries-resistant group was at least 128-fold greater than that of caries-susceptible group. The results demonstrate that the bacterial aggregating epitope of salivary mucins is expressed to a greater extent in caries-resistant individuals, and that this epitope is apparently more accessible to bacteria in the low molecular weight mucin form.
TI  - Characterization of the Streptococcus mutans GS-5 fruA gene encoding exo-beta-D-fructosidase.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence (5,010 bp) of the fructanase gene (fruA) and flanking regions of the chromosome of Streptococcus mutans GS-5 was determined. The fruA gene appears to be the sole transcript arising from a proximal promoter. The presumed precursor of the secreted FruA protein consists of 1,423 amino acids, and it has an M(r) of 158,656 and a pI of 4.82. The N terminus of FruA has characteristics in common with signal peptides of gram-positive organisms. The C terminus consists of a serine- and threonine-rich region, followed by the peptide LPDTGD, 4 charged amino acids, 21 amino acids with a strongly hydrophobic character, and a charged pentapeptide tail, which are proposed to correspond to the wall-spanning region, the LPXTGX consensus sequence, and the membrane-spanning domains of surface-associated proteins of gram-positive cocci. The FruA protein has significant homology with the Bacillus subtilis levanase (SacC), the Bacteroides fragilis levanase (ScrL), yeast invertases, and a number of other beta-fructosidases but not with fructosyltransferase, glucosyltransferases, or glucan-binding proteins of oral streptococci. Genes with homology to fruA were detected in S. mutans serotype c, e, and f strains, Streptococcus rattus, Streptococcus salivarius, and Streptococcus sanguis. A deletion derivative of FruA lacking the C-terminal 437 amino acids was still functional and could hydrolyze beta-(2,6)- and beta-(2,1)-linked sugars, but with altered preference for substrates. The data begin to define functional domains of the FruA protein and potential regulatory sites for induction, repression, growth rate control, and posttranslational localization of this multifunctional enzyme.
TI  - Effect of gels containing stannous fluoride on oral bacteria--an in vitro study.
AB  - The purposes of this investigation were to evaluate and compare the antimicrobial effect of (1) twelve 0.4 per cent stannous fluoride (SnF2) commercial products and (2) different concentrations of SnF2 (range = 0.02 to 3.28 per cent). The antibacterial inhibitory effect of various SnF2 gels was evaluated as to their effectiveness against oral plaque bacteria including strains of S. mutans, S. sanguis, S. sobrinus, A. viscosus, A. actinomycetemcomitans, and B. intermedius. When twelve different commercial preparations of 0.4 per cent SnF2 were compared for inhibitory effect on plaque bacteria, several of the SnF2 preparations were significantly more effective in inhibiting oral bacteria (p < 0.05). With increasing concentration of SnF2, there was a comparable increase in the inhibitory effect on the oral bacteria tested (r2 ranged from 0.867 to 0.996). SnF2 at a concentration of 0.4 per cent had a similar antibacterial effect to 0.12 per cent chlorhexidine. This in vitro study demonstrated that certain SnF2 products are highly effective in inhibiting the growth of bacteria often found in plaque, and this inhibitory effect is directly related to the concentration of the SnF2.
TI  - Restricted distribution of Streptococcus milleri carbohydrate type antigens amongst other viridans streptococci.
AB  - The distribution of oral Streptococcus milleri carbohydrate type antigens in other viridans streptococcus species was examined. Rantz-Randall extracts of cells of the test strains grown in broth containing glucose were allowed to react with typing or grouping antisera for S. milleri serotypes a-k, or Lancefield groups A-G and K. Of 93 strains comprising more than 12 streptococcal species that included S. mutans and S. sanguis complexes, only 15 S. salivarius strains and one S. mitis strain were immunologically related to S. milleri serotype f. Unlike S. milleri strains, S. salivarius type f strains belonged to Lancefield group K, whereas the S. mitis strain was closely related to S. milleri serotype f but did not react with any of the Lancefield grouping antisera tested. Results suggest that oral S. milleri strains can be distinguished serologically from other oral viridans streptococci and that the typing antisera used in our researches might differentiate S. milleri isolates from the mouth from those associated with systemic purulent infections.
TI  - [Histological study of the structure of artificial plaque].
AB  - Five cariogenic bacteria were used to produce a plaque, called artificial plaque, by sequential culture in vitro. The results showed that the artificial plaque is very similar to the natural one in morphology and structure. Artificial plaque may be taken as an excellent model in vitro for the studies on cariogenicity of dental plaque.
TI  - The influence of morphological variation on Candida albicans adhesion to denture  acrylic in vitro.
AB  - Using denture acrylic pieces coated with either whole human stimulated saliva or  oral streptococci, the binding ability of three different Candida albicans strains was investigated. The C. albicans strains include a clinical isolate with the commonly observed, smooth, round colonial morphology (strain 613p), a morphological variant spontaneously derived from the clinical isolate strain 613p (strain 613m1BK) and a clinical isolate from an oral lesion that was also a morphological variant upon primary isolation (strain 228). Levels of adhesion to the acrylic pieces were determined radiometrically using C. albicans cells metabolically labelled with [35S]-methionine. Whole stimulated saliva significantly increased the binding of all strains compared to uncoated acrylic. However, the level of binding of strain 613p to saliva-coated acrylic was significantly greater than the levels observed for the morphological variant strain 613m1BK. Coating acrylic pieces with either Streptococcus sanguis NCTC 10904, Strep. mutans GS-5 or Strep. sobrinus ATCC 27352 instead of saliva resulted in significantly greater binding by strain 613p compared to uncoated acrylic. Pre-coating the acrylic with the oral streptococci did not significantly increase the binding of morphological variant strains 613m1BK and 228 compared to uncoated acrylic. In general, preincubation of adherent streptococci with sucrose to induce the synthesis of extracellular carbohydrate polymers did not significantly increase the binding levels of the C. albicans strains above those observed using streptococci in buffer alone. Compared to its parental strain 613p, morphological variant strain 613m1BK adhered poorly to denture acrylic coated with either salivary constituents or oral streptococci, while strain 228 adhered to the same substrates at an intermediate level. Furthermore, physical disaggregation of clusters of the morphological variant strain 613m1BK did not appear to increase its binding capacity to saliva-coated denture acrylic. The effect of whole stimulated saliva on the adherence of C. albicans 613p to a variety of plastic substrates in addition to denture acrylic was examined. Overall, saliva pre-coating of the various plastics promoted C. albicans 613p adhesion. The adhesion of strain 613p to denture acrylic coated with whole stimulated saliva from each of five different donors or with parotid and submandibular/sublingual saliva from each of two donors was also examined. Regardless of donor, a coating of whole stimulated saliva significantly increased the binding of strain 613p to denture acrylic compared to uncoated acrylic. In addition, a coating of parotid saliva significantly increased the binding of strain 613p to denture acrylic compared to submandibular/sublingual saliva.
TI  - Comparative acid tolerances and inhibitor sensitivities of isolated F-ATPases of  oral lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - pH activity profiles and inhibitor sensitivities were compared for membrane ATPases isolated from three oral lactic acid bacteria, Lactobacillus casei ATCC 4646, Streptococcus mutans GS-5, and Streptococcus sanguis NCTC 10904, with, respectively, high, moderate, and low levels of acid tolerance. Membranes containing F1F0 ATPases were isolated by means of salt lysis of cells treated with muralytic enzymes. Membrane-free F1F0 complexes were then isolated from membranes by detergent extraction with Triton X-100 or octylglucoside. Finally, F1 complexes free of the proton-conducting F0 sector were obtained by washing membranes with buffers of low ionic strength. The pH activity profiles of the membrane-associated enzymes reflected the general acid tolerances of the organisms from which they were isolated; for example, pH optima were approximately 5.5, 6.0, and 7.0, respectively, for enzymes from L. casei, S. mutans, and S. sanguis. Roughly similar profiles were found for membrane-free F1F0 complexes, which were stabilized by phospholipids against loss of activity during storage. However, profiles for F1 enzymes were distinctly narrower, indicating that association with F0 and possibly other membrane components enhanced tolerance to both acid and alkaline media. All of the enzymes were found to have similar sensitivities to Al-F complexes, but only F1F0 enzymes were highly sensitive to dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. The procedures described for isolation of membrane-free F1F0 forms of the enzymes from oral lactic acid bacteria will be of use in future studies of the characteristics of the enzymes, especially in studies with liposomes.
TI  - Purification and properties of sorbitol-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from oral streptococci.
AB  - The activity of sorbitol-6-phosphate (S6P) dehydrogenase (S6PDH) and the sorbitol transport system were studied in strains of the oral streptococci Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mutans. Genetically transformed (to ferment sorbitol) strains and their DNA donors were included. S6PDH was purified by anion exchange chromatography and gel filtration. The purity of the enzyme was confirmed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified enzyme from all the strains exhibited Michaelis-Menton saturation kinetics. The Km values for nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and S6P ranged between 0.03 and 0.21 mM and 0.07 and 0.20 mM respectively. The relative molecular weights of the native enzyme were 229,000 for one donor-transformant pair (S. sanguis and S. gordonii), 107,000 for the other pair (S. mitis and S. gordonii) and 129,000 for S. mutans. The molecular weights of the S6PDH subunits ranged from 26,000 to 28,000. The pH optima (greater than 8.5) and the amino acid composition (15 amino acids examined) were similar for the S6PDH from the different strains. However, the chromatographic and electrophoretic patterns as well as the Km values for NAD and S6P were the same only between the S6PDHs from the strains within each donor-transformant pair. Purified S6PDH from S. mutans also exhibited low mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase activity. Sorbitol-grown decryptified cells of all the strains phosphorylated sorbitol in the presence of phosphoenolpyruvate but not in the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP-mediated phosphorylation of glucose was observed with the same strains when grown on glucose. No evidence for a non-phosphotransferase transport system was found for sorbitol in any of the strains.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - pH regulation by Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The intracellular pH (pHi) optimum for glycolysis in Streptococcus mutans Ingbritt was determined to be 7.0 by use of the ionophore gramicidin for manipulation of pHi. Glycolytic activity decreased to zero as the pHi was lowered from 7.0 to 5.0. In contrast, glycolysis had an extracellular pH (pHo) optimum of 6.0 with a much broader profile. The relative insensitivity of glycolysis to the lowering of pHo was attributed to the ability of S. mutans to maintain a transmembrane pH gradient (delta pH, inside more alkaline) at low pHo. At a pHo of 5.0, glycolyzing cells of S. mutans maintained a delta pH of 1.37 +/- 0.09 units. The maintenance of this delta pH was dependent on the concentration of potassium ions in the extracellular medium. Potassium was rapidly taken up by glycolyzing cells of S. mutans at a rate of 70 nmol/mg dry weight/min. This uptake was dependent on the presence of both ATP and a proton motive-force (delta p). The addition of N-N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) to glycolyzing cells of S. mutans caused a partial collapse of the delta pH. Growth of S. mutants at pHo 5.5 in continuous culture resulted in the maintenance of a delta pH larger than that produced by cells grown at pH 7.0. These results suggest the presence of a proton-translocating F1Fo-ATPase in S. mutans whose activity is regulated by the intracellular pH and transmembrane electrical potential (delta psi). The production of an artificial delta p of 124 mV across the cell membrane of S. mutans did not result in proton movement through the F1Fo-ATPase coupled to ATP synthesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Morphologic and biochemical characteristics of viridans streptococci isolated from dental plaque].
AB  - The purposes of this study were to give the characteristics of viridans streptococci isolated from dental plaque, and the relationships with dental caries. We stained 69 patients' teeth on supragingival plaques (Plaque Index = 1) with the Pfiffer's reagent or FD&C RED#28 dye, then isolated 80 strains of oral streptococci from 69 patients. Cultures were grown in TSB, MS, and MSB media. A total of 80 fresh-isolated plaque streptococci, including strains of S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. mitis, and S. mutans were identified on the basis of morphologic, dark field, SEM, and biochemical characteristics. All of the oral plaque streptococci were to be found in significant percentages in dental plaque. Patients who had caries harboured S. mutans more often (37/40) than patients without caries (7/29). S. mutans comprised the greatest percentage (37/69) of microorganisms encountered in caries' plaque, and there was an association between high counts of S. mutans and the presence of dental caries. Cultural and biochemical methods were used for the isolation and identification of the different species of S. mutans. The result indicated that biotype I were the most predominant species (50%) in dental plaque. Thus, it is possible to isolate, screen and identify unknown strains through the morphologic, darkfield, SEM, and biochemical characteristics of viridans streptococci isolated from human dental plaque. By means of the present methods for identification, we hold considerable promises for contributing to the prevention and diagnosis of dental diseases.
TI  - Isolation and properties of the Capnocytophaga ochracea bacteriocin.
AB  - A bacteriocin from a subgingival plaque isolate of Capnocytophaga ochracea was purified and characterized. It was isolated from cell extract and had a molecular weight of 100,000. Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans and Propionibacterium acnes were susceptible to the bacteriocin.
TI  - Effect of slow-release chlorhexidine mouthguards on the levels of selected salivary bacteria.
AB  - This study evaluated the effect of an alternate delivery system for chlorhexidine on salivary levels of mutans streptococci (MS) and other selected oral bacteria. On the basis of salivary MS levels > or = 10(4) CFU/ml, 22 subjects were enrolled. All caries lesions were restored prior to treatment. Two pretreatment paraffin-stimulated saliva samples were obtained for culturing at least 1 week apart. Complete-arch vacuum-adapted mouthguards were individually fabricated and coated internally with a 3% w/v chlorhexidine varnish. Mouthguards were worn for an average of 7 h/night for 7 nights. Saliva samples were obtained immediately after treatment and 1 and 3 months later. There was no significant change in levels of any of the monitored bacteria between the two pretreatment samples. A significant and specific reduction in salivary MS levels was observed in the three after-treatment samples as compared with baseline values (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p < 0.05, respectively). The levels of Actinomyces viscosus were also measured, and there was a significant reduction immediately after treatment (p < 0.05), a return to baseline values at 1 month, and a significant increase above baseline values at 3 months, (p < 0.001). There was no significant change in saliva volume, in total numbers of facultatively anaerobic bacteria, or in levels of lactobacilli or Streptococcus sanguis. This treatment system is capable of significant and specific suppression of MS levels for up to 3 months without retreatment.
TI  - Multibacterial artificial plaque. A model for studying carious process.
AB  - A multibacterial artificial plaque was established in vitro on enamel slabs incubated in mixed culture of Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans (serotype c), Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus casei and Actinomyces viscosus. Typical structure same as natural plaque was seen under microscope. The caries-like lesion produced under the plaque was observed in enamel sections. The lesion was similar in appearance to natural ones under optic and scanning electron microscopes. The acids produced in both culture media and artificial plaque were similar in composition and type to those produced in natural plaque after sugar attack. It is suggested that this kind of plaque model may be useful in studying carious process in vitro, because it is easily controlled either by changing the composition of bacteria or by adding different kinds of nutrient in the media. Moreover, the results will be easier to explain than those produced in natural ones.
TI  - Noncariogenicity of maltitol in specific pathogen-free rats infected with mutans  streptococci.
AB  - The effect of maltitol on caries development was examined in an experimental caries system employing specific pathogen-free (SPF) Sprague-Dawley rats. Fourteen strains of oral streptococci, including mutans streptococci, did not utilize the maltitol nor produce sufficient acid to demineralize tooth enamel. Furthermore, maltitol did not serve as a substrate for glucosyltransferases of either Streptococcus mutans MT8148R or Streptococcus sobrinus 6715 to synthesize water-insoluble glucan. Maltitol induced no significant dental caries in SPF rats infected with these mutans streptococci, and replacement of the dietary sucrose content with maltitol resulted in a trend towards caries reduction in SPF rats.
TI  - Inhibition of microbial adherence and growth by various glass ionomers in vitro.
AB  - This study measured the in vitro inhibition of growth and adherence of five oral  bacteria by glass-ionomer materials. Disks were prepared from two cavity liners and four restorative class materials, by use of Teflon plates with circular wells, five mm wide and two mm deep. The bacterial species tested included: A. viscosus, S. mitis, S. mutans, L. casei, and S. sanguis. Growth inhibition studies were performed by the spreading of 0.1 mL of standardized inocula over agar plates produced with selective media, followed by the direct application of glass-ionomer disks onto the agar. On other plates, disks were placed onto uninoculated agars for 48 h, followed by bacterial inoculation. All agar plates were incubated under optimal growth conditions for each bacterial species. The four restorative materials were also placed aseptically into sterilized bovine incisors and placed into sucrose containing broth media, inoculated with S. mutans for three days. Adhering materials were disclosed and scored. An ion-exchange electrode was used to measure fluoride release over a seven-day period for all six glass ionomers. The two cavity liners and two of the restorative materials produced the largest growth inhibition zones by direct contact. No growth inhibition occurred when the specimens were allowed to come into contact with the agars prior to inoculation. All four restorative materials reduced bacterial accumulations on enamel surfaces by over 80%. Elevations in short-term fluoride release levels were positively correlated with growth inhibition.
TI  - Noncariogenicity of erythritol as a substrate.
AB  - Erythritol is a sugar alcohol produced by Aureobasidium sp. from glucose. It is 75-80% as sweet as sucrose and is also nonhygroscopic. The aim of this study was to evaluate this sugar substitute from a cariological point of view. Erythritol was neither utilized as a substrate for the lactic acid production nor for plaque formation of mutans streptococci (serotypes a-h) and certain oral microorganisms. It was not utilized for water-insoluble glucan synthesis or cellular adherence by glucosyltransferase from Streptococcus mutans PS-14 (c) and Streptococcus sobrinus 6715 (g). Finally, a significantly lower caries score (3.1 +/- 0.5; mean +/- SEM) was observed in specific pathogen-free rats infected with S. sobrinus 6715 and fed with a diet containing 26% erythritol, as compared to control rats fed with a diet containing 26% sucrose (60.5 +/- 2.0). Also, rats provided a diet containing 56% erythritol chocolate (23.8% erythritol) and challenged with S. mutans PS-14 exhibited a significantly lower caries score (6.7 +/- 0.8) compared to the sucrose chocolate group (82.8 +/- 2.8). The main conclusion from this study is therefore that erythritol is a promising sugar substitute from a cariological point of view.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of a dental varnish, in vitro.
AB  - The effects of a polymer based antimicrobial releasing varnish Cervitec were investigated against different gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains as well as a yeast using the agar diffusion inhibitory test (ADT-test in vitro). As positive controls a 1% chlorhexidine gel and 1% aqueous solution of thymol and a placebo polymer varnish without active agents were employed. The test experimental varnish containing 1% chlorhexidine and 1% thymol showed antimicrobial activity against all gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms tested including one Candida strain. The positive controls were similar in effect compared to the test varnish. No antimicrobial effect was observed with the placebo varnish without active ingredients. Toothpicks and dental floss treated with the test varnish showed an antimicrobial effect against S. mutans even after storing in room temperature up to 12 months. The results from this study support earlier laboratory studies that chlorhexidine and thymol diffuse out of the experimental varnish and that the varnish is active against various of oral pathogens. The possibility to use toothpicks or dental floss impregnated with the varnish with the aim to become chemotherapeutically active against periodontal diseases as well as against dental caries, is promising and should be tested in vivo.
TI  - A mechanism of passive immunization with monoclonal antibodies to a 185,000 M(r)  streptococcal antigen.
AB  - The cell surface streptococcal antigen (SA) I/II of 185,000 M(r) is an immunodominant molecule that expresses one or more adhesion determinants. A series of 14 monoclonal antibodies (MAb) to defined parts of SA I/II were generated and some of these were used in passive immunization of macaques. Topical administration of selected MAb to the teeth of macaques prevented colonization of endogenous or implanted exogenous Streptococcus mutans for a period of 1 year. Significant reduction of both smooth surface and fissure caries was found in macaques who had MAb (Guy's 1) applied to their teeth, as compared with saline-treated animals. A series of in vivo passive immunization experiments was then carried out in 57 human subjects. Topical application of MAb to SA I/II prevented colonization of both artificially implanted exogenous strains of S. mutans, as well as natural recolonization by indigenous S. mutans. The properties of the protective MAb were then investigated and the epitope specificity within the SA I/II molecule was found to be essential but not the isotype specificity of the immunoglobulin (Ig). The requirement for complement activating and the phagocyte binding sites of the Fc fragment of MAb was not essential, as the F(ab')2 fragment of the MAb was as protective as the intact IgG, but the Fab fragment failed to prevent recolonization of S. mutans. Prevention of recolonization was specifically restricted to S. mutans, as the proportion of other organisms, such as S. sanguis, failed to show a significant change. The surprising feature of these experiments was that protection of re-colonization of S. mutans lasted up to 2 years, although MAb was applied for only 3 weeks and functional MAb was detected on the teeth only 3 days following application of the MAb. The long-term protection could therefore not be accounted for by a persistence of MAb on the teeth, but may be due to a shift in the microbial balance in which other bacteria occupy the ecological niche vacated by S. mutans, resulting in colonization resistance to S. mutans. Gene cloning and sequencing the SA from S. mutans, S. sobrinus and S. sanguis identified a conserved region (residues 955-1213) which on Southern hybridization and partial DNA sequence analysis was also found in 19 alpha-haemolytic oral streptococci. The results suggest that the SA molecule may constitute a family of adhesins in oral alpha haemolytic streptococci.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Identification of monoclonal antibody-binding domains within antigen P1 of Streptococcus mutans and cross-reactivity with related surface antigens of oral streptococci.
AB  - Eleven monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for P1, the major protein surface antigen of Streptococcus mutans serotype c, were characterized by Western blot (immunoblot) analysis and by radioimmunoassay using whole bacterial cells. The approximate binding domains of the MAbs were determined by using full-length and truncated P1 polypeptides. The accessibility of these binding sites on the surfaces of intact bacteria was determined by radioimmunoassay. The ability of each MAb to cross-react with related proteins from strains of S. mutans serotypes e and f, S. sanguis, and S. sobrinus serotype g is also reported.
TI  - Measuring harmful levels of bacteria in dental aerosols.
AB  - The potential spread of the bacteria in aerosols emphasizes the familiar triad--gloves, masks and eyewear--for all operative procedures.
TI  - A scheme for the identification of viridans streptococci.
AB  - A collection of strains representing all the currently recognised species of oral or viridans streptococci (Streptococcus sanguis, S. parasanguis, S. gordonii, S. oralis, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. vestibularis, S. anginosus, S. constellatus, s. intermedius, S. mutans and S. sobrinus) were tested for the production of a range of glycosidase activities with 4-methylumbelliferyl-linked fluorogenic substrates, and for reactions in a range of conventional fermentation and hydrolytic tests. The resulting biochemical scheme, consisting of 14 tests, enabled the differentiation of all these species and distinguished three biotypes within S. sanguis. The scheme reported here represents an improvement over currently available schemes for the identification of viridans streptococci.
TI  - Clinical trial in adults of an antimicrobial varnish for reducing mutans streptococci.
AB  - An abbreviated treatment with a chlorhexidine-containing varnish was compared with a similar treatment with a placebo varnish and with a prophylaxis alone for its effects on the numbers of detectable salivary mutants streptococci in 51 adults. The varnishes, applied once weekly for four weeks, were held in place with a covering layer of either of two polyurethane sealants (FluorProtector or Adhesit). On the first appointment, the varnish-sealant combination was applied to all tooth surfaces, but on succeeding appointments only the occlusal and approximal surfaces were covered. The chlorhexidine varnish, covered with either sealant, reduced the salivary mutans streptococci by an average of 3 logs (99.9%) in all of the 20 subjects treated, and below detectable levels for at least four weeks in nine of them. In the groups receiving placebo varnish-sealant combinations, the mean log number of mutans streptococci of the subjects was reduced only by approximately 0.5 log (32%), and none of the subjects experienced loss of their detectable mutans streptococci for four weeks, although one subject did so for three weeks. No significant difference between the effects of the two polyurethane sealants was observed. Treatment with a single prophylaxis had no effect on mutans streptococcus levels. Subjects treated with chlorhexidine varnish also experienced an increase in S. sanguis and a small decrease in yeasts. Loss of detectable mutans streptococci did not cause changes in the numbers of other micro-organisms examined, beyond those observed with chlorhexidine varnish treatment alone.
TI  - Enumeration of oral streptococci on media containing different concentrations of  sodium and potassium ions.
AB  - Laboratory "type" strains of oral streptococci were screened for their ability to grow on mitis-salivarius agar (MSA) in the presence of increasing concentrations of either Na+ or K+ up to 500 mmol/L. Strains were generally better able to withstand increasing concentrations of Na+ than K+, although low numbers of colony-forming units (cfus) were seen with the highest concentration of either cation. Two strains of Streptococcus mutans, Ingbritt 162 and Ingbritt 175, behaved differently when the concentration of cation was increased from 50 to 200 mmol/L; the latter showed a marked increase in the number of cfus when the Na+ concentration was increased from 50 to 200 mmol/L, whereas there was a decrease with strain Ingbritt 162. Strains of oral streptococci from the saliva of adults and children were isolated on modified MSA containing known concentrations of Na+ and K+ and further examined if they showed "mutans-like" colony morphology. The number of cfus generally dropped as the concentration of Na+ or K+ was increased from 200 to 350 or 500 mmol/L. Greater numbers of streptococci were tolerant to Na+ than to K+. Half of the isolates were members of the Streptococcus sanguis group (SSG), either Streptococcus mitis or S. sanguis II, and these were more tolerant to high concentrations of Na+ or K+ than other isolates that were identified as Streptococcus morbillorum, Streptococcus acidominimus, and Streptococcus milleri.
TI  - Salivary-agglutinin-mediated adherence of Streptococcus mutans to early plaque bacteria.
AB  - Interspecies binding is important in the colonization of the oral cavity by bacteria. Streptococcus mutans can adhere to other plaque bacteria, such as Streptococcus sanguis and Actinomyces viscosus, and this adherence is enhanced by saliva. The salivary and bacterial molecules that mediate this interaction were investigated. Salivary agglutinin, a mucinlike glycoprotein known to mediate the aggregation of many oral streptococci in vitro, was found to mediate the adherence of S. mutans to S. sanguis or A. viscosus. Adherence of S. mutans to saliva- or agglutinin-coated S. sanguis and A. viscosus was inhibited by antibodies to the bacterial agglutinin receptor. Expression of the S. sanguis receptor (SSP-5) gene in Enterococcus faecalis increased adhesion of this organism to saliva- or agglutinin-coated S. sanguis and A. viscosus. This interaction could be inhibited by antibodies to the agglutinin receptor. The results suggest that salivary agglutinin can promote adherence of S. mutans to S. sanguis and A. viscosus through interactions with the agglutinin receptor on S. mutans.
TI  - Influence of delmopinol on bacterial zeta-potentials and on the colloidal stability of bacterial suspensions.
AB  - Delmopinol is a low molecular weight surface-active compound that has been shown  to be effective against dental plaque both in vitro and in vivo and against gingivitis in vivo. To study the mode of action of delmopinol, the influence of the compound on the stability of bacterial suspensions, both with and without saliva, and on the zeta-potentials of oral streptococci was studied. The results showed that delmopinol reduced the magnitude of the zeta-potentials, but, in contrast, the colloidal stability of the bacterial suspensions without saliva was increased. The explanation of these observations could be that non-DLVO interaction components, such as repulsive hydration/steric forces, have come into effect at very close distances between two approaching bacterial cells. To judge from the present results, it is possible that delmopinol forms films on bacterial cells in a plaque, thereby facilitating mechanical removal.
TI  - Streptococcal adherence to uncoated and saliva-coated restoratives.
AB  - The adherence of Streptococcus sanguis and S. mutans to seven restoratives in the presence and absence of an artificial salivary pellicle has been investigated. The physiochemical surface characteristics of the bacteria and of the restoratives were also measured, together with the effect of salivary coating of restoratives. Zeta potential of uncoated restoratives showed a positive correlation with the number of adherent S. mutans cells and S. sanguis cells. S. sanguis showed a positive correlation with the hydrophobicity of uncoated restoratives. The surface hydrophobicity was decreased upon saliva coating, whereas the zeta potential was slightly increased. The contact angles or zeta potentials of saliva-coated restoratives were positively correlated with those of uncoated restoratives. The number of adherent cells of both S. sanguis and S. mutans to saliva-coated restoratives were decreased after the coating. Zeta potential of saliva-coated restoratives showed a positive correlation with the numbers of adherent S. mutans cells, suggesting that non-specific electrostatic interactions have an important role in the adherence of this species.
TI  - Conservation of the gene encoding streptococcal antigen I/II in oral streptococci.
AB  - The spaP gene of Streptococcus mutans serotype c encodes a major cell surface protein, streptococcal antigen (SA) I/II, with an Mr of 185,000, that is thought to be involved in bacterial adhesion to teeth. Proteins with significant amino acid sequence homology to SA I/II have also been found in S. sobrinus and S. sanguis. The objectives of this study were to investigate the conservation of the spaP gene in the mutans groups of streptococci and to determine whether homologous genes were present in other species of alpha-hemolytic streptococci. DNA extracted from representative strains of 19 streptococcal species was examined by Southern hybridization and partial DNA sequence analysis. A series of five overlapping DNA probes from the spaP gene were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and used in the Southern hybridizations. The entire gene was found to be well conserved in all strains of S. mutans serotypes c, e, and f investigated. A probe from the 3' region of the gene, which encodes residues 857 to 1207 of the SA I/II protein, hybridized with DNA from a number of mutans streptococci, as well as with DNA from nonmutans alpha-hemolytic streptococci. Conservation within this region was further demonstrated by sequencing gene fragments of two strains of S. intermedius and S. oralis. The results show that some regions of the spaP gene are highly conserved not only in the mutans group of streptococci but also in other nonmutans alpha-hemolytic streptococci. This suggests that a family of cell surface proteins which, by analogy with the 185,000-Mr SA I/II of S. mutans, could be involved in bacterial adhesion might exist.
TI  - Sequence and structural analysis of surface protein antigen I/II (SpaA) of Streptococcus sobrinus.
AB  - Streptococcal antigen I/II or the surface protein antigen A (SpaA) of Streptococcus sobrinus is an adhesin which mediates binding of the organism to tooth surfaces. The complete sequence of the gene which encodes SpaA has been determined. The gene consists of 4,584 bp and encodes a protein of 1,528 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequence shows extensive homology with those of the cell surface adhesins from Streptococcus mutans serotypes c and f and from Streptococcus sanguis. Structural analysis of the N-terminal region (residues 50 to 550), which is rich in alanine and includes four tandem repeats of an 82-residue sequence, suggests that it adopts an alpha-helical coiled-coil conformation. Cell surface hydrophobicity may be associated with this region. The C-terminal region is more conserved and includes two tandem repeats of a 39-residue proline-rich sequence. A further proline-rich sequence in this region is predicted to span the cell wall. Although a hydrophobic sequence is present in the C-terminal region, it appears to be too short to span the cell membrane. Anchoring of SpaA in the cell membrane may therefore require some form of posttranslational modification or association with another membrane protein.
TI  - The effect of sucralfate on the growth of cariogenic streptococci.
AB  - Sucralfate, an aluminum salt of sucrose octasulfate, has been shown to be effective in reducing the discomfort of radiation therapy-induced oral mucositis. This study was done to determine whether sucralfate could be used as a nutritional source for dental caries-producing organisms. Three Streptococcus strains were cultured in a defined medium. Sucralfate powder was evaluated for its ability to be used as a carbohydrate food source by these organisms. The addition of sucralfate alone did not stimulate the organism's growth. The addition of sucralfate and glucose resulted in less growth than the addition of glucose alone. Increasing the sucralfate concentration from 1% to 10% in the glucose-containing cultures resulted in statistically significant growth inhibition (p less than 0.02). Sucralfate appears to have no cariogenic potential and may have some cariostatic potential.
TI  - Antineoplastic agents inhibit the growth of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis in vitro.
AB  - The effect of methotrexate (MTX) and doxorubicin on the growth, metabolism and ultrastructure of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis was studied in vitro. Both anticancer drugs exerted an inhibitory effect on the oral streptococci. MTX was more inhibitory than doxorubicin. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of MTX to S. mutans were 0.25-2.5 micrograms/ml and that of doxorubicin 0.2 mg/ml. The MICs of MTX and doxorubicin to S. sanguis were 0.025 micrograms/ml and 2.0-0.02 mg/ml, respectively. When saliva samples of patients with malignant tumors receiving various doses of MTX were analyzed, MTX was found to be secreted into the oral cavity at concentrations ranging from 0.014 to 4.486 micrograms/ml. The saliva of these patients was also found to inhibit the growth of S. mutans, and the inhibition zones were in accordance with the MIC values observed. The results suggest that anticancer therapy must be taken into account when the salivary microbiological findings of cancer patients are interpreted.
TI  - Selective effects of histidine-rich polypeptides on the aggregation and viability of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - Enriched preparations of histidine-rich polypeptides (HRPs) and isolated HRP pairs (1-2, 3-4 and 5-6) degrade in the presence of fresh autologous whole saliva to a series of low-molecular-weight cationic peptides (HRPs 6a-c and 7). Analysis of the HRPs during degradation indicates that: HRP 1 is not the parent molecule of the HRPs; the HRP pairs do not convert to each other in a cascade-like sequence in saliva; and the HRPs can be separated into 2 groups consisting of HRPs 1-2 and 3-7. Preparations containing HRPs 1-7, 1-2, and 3-7 were obtained by fractionation and separation on Bio-Rex 70, and tested for aggregating and antibacterial effects against Streptococcus mutans BHT, S. mutans GS-5 and Streptococcus sanguis G9B. HRPs 1-2 had significant aggregating effects on all 3 strains but the other HRPs had little to no agglutinating ability. The HRPs did not inhibit the growth of S. sanguis, and HRPs 1-2 enhanced its growth. No growth enhancement by the HRPs was observed for the 2 S. mutans strains. However, significant bacterial inhibition of the S. mutans strains was noted after incubation with HRPs 3-7. The data suggest that the dissimilar effects of HRPs 1-2 and 3-7 may be of importance in the colonization and growth of S. mutans and S. sanguis in vivo.
TI  - The presence of two forms of the phosphocarrier protein HPr of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system in streptococci.
AB  - The protein, HPr, a necessary component of the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (PTS) in bacteria, was purified from Streptococcus salivarius by column chromatography. The purified preparation gave only one band when analyzed by sodium dodecylsulfate gel electrophoresis or by isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gel (pI = 4.85). However, electrophoresis in Tris-containing buffers under non-denaturing conditions revealed 2 bands that could be phosphorylated by PEP in the presence of enzyme I of the PTS or by ATP with the HPr kinase. Homogeneous preparations of these 2 forms could be obtained by preparative electrophoresis. Each preparation exhibited only 1 band when analyzed by electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions, indicating that the doublet observed before preparative electrophoresis was not an electrophoretic artefact. The electrophoretic mobility of each protein was not modified following heat-treatment at 100 degrees C for 20 min or storage at -40 degrees C for several months. Both HPr proteins catalyzed in vitro the PEP-dependent phosphorylation of glucose, but at a rate slightly lower than that observed with a preparation of HPr containing both forms of the protein. Both forms were also able to transfer the phosphate group from PEP to the other specific PTS proteins known in S salivarius. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against each form reacted with both proteins. The presence of the 2 forms of HPr was detected in fresh cellular extracts of S salivarius; however, their intracellular ratio varied according to growth conditions. A doublet was also found in many other streptococcal species tested (S mutans, S sobrinus, S sanguis, S thermophilus, S bovis, S rattus) and also in L lactis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Molecular basis for the association of glucosyltransferases with the cell surface of oral streptococci.
AB  - The expression of Streptococcus mutans mutant glucosyltransferase-I enzymes in S. sanguis and S. milleri suggests that cell-associated glucosyltransferase activity is dependent upon both glucan synthesis and glucan binding by the carboxyl-terminal repeating units of the enzyme. Mutant enzymes lacking these repeating units were only present in the extracellular fluids of these transformed streptococcal strains.
TI  - In-vitro bacteriocin-mediated antagonism by oral streptococci against human carrier strains of staphylococci.
AB  - All strains of oral streptococci tested and specially those of Streptococcus mutans, Strep. sanguis and Strep. mitior produced more than one distinct bacteriocin-like substance with variable inhibitory activity on 20 indicator staphylococci. Inhibitory activity was comparatively higher on nasal strains of Staph. aureus and Staph. epidermidis than on strains of both species isolated from the mouth. Nineteen of 20 staphylococcal indicators were inhibited by 1-12 of the 12 effector streptococci. Sensitivity of nasal staphylococci to bacteriocins (frequency of positive inhibitory tests and total inhibition zone diameters) was significantly higher (P less than 0.001, chi 2 test and P less than 0.05, t test respectively) than that of oral ones. The sensitivity of nasal over oral Staph. aureus (P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.01) and of oral Staph. epidermidis over oral Staph. aureus (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.05) was also significantly higher. The evaluation of variability of inhibitory patterns of bacteriocins produced by streptococci (p-typing), of sensitivity patterns of staphylococci to bacteriocins (s-typing) and of the significantly higher sensitivity of nasal over oral staphylococci to bacteriocins from the epidemiological and ecological viewpoints are discussed.
TI  - Factors affecting peptide catabolism by oral streptococci.
AB  - The binding of a number of unsubstituted peptides to Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mutans and their subsequent degradation by such cells were examined. Peptides were added to cell suspensions prepared from glucose-limited growth in a chemostat and, at appropriate time intervals, cell-free filtrates were analyzed for peptides and their constituent amino acid residues by high-pressure liquid chromatography techniques. The results indicated that peptide hydrophobicity plays a limited role in peptide binding, but that charge and chain-length are probably important. In S. sanguis, carboxypeptidase activity rapidly released C-terminal arginine (Arg); this amino acid was less rapidly released from the N-terminus but a number of other residues were also released by aminopeptidase activity. When Arg is buried in the peptide, the rate of its release depends upon the number and type of residues between it and the N-terminus. In contrast, S. mutans possessed only weak peptidase activities. The nature of its peptidase activities indicates that S. sanguis can obtain the metabolically important Arg from a variety of peptides.
TI  - Metabolism of 17 beta-estradiol by oral Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Bacillus cereus and Candida albicans.
AB  - The ability of oral isolates of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Bacillus cereus and Candida albicans to metabolize 17 beta-estradiol was analyzed by thin-layer chromatography using 4-14C-estradiol as the substrate. All test microorganisms metabolized 17 beta-estradiol. Estrone was the main metabolic product, except for B. cereus, which converted 17 beta-estradiol mainly to unidentified, more polar metabolites. S. sanguis and B. cereus had the most active metabolism but S. mutans and C. albicans were also active.
TI  - Effect of calcium ions on cell surface electrostatics of Bacteroides gingivalis and other oral bacteria.
AB  - Surface electrostatics of Bacteroides gingivalis and other oral bacteria were examined. A polarization circuit was employed using platinum electrodes exposed in each bacterial suspension and the number of bacteria adsorbed to the anode and cathode were then estimated. In all bacteria (B. gingivalis, Streptococcus sobrinus, S. mutans, S. salivarius, S. sanguis and Actinomyces viscosus), the number of cells adsorbed to the anode were much greater than the number of cells adsorbed to the cathode. Treating these bacteria with calcium ions tended to decrease the ratio of the number of cells adsorbed to the anode to the number of cells adsorbed to the cathode in all bacteria examined. Moreover, in the case of B. gingivalis, the number of cells adsorbed to the anode and cathode was in an inverse relationship to the number counted before calcium ion treatment. These findings indicate that the cell surfaces of oral bacteria are generally negatively charged but only the cell surface electrostatics of B. gingivalis was dramatically affected by calcium ion treatment. Thus, divalent metal bridges such as calcium bridges contribute to the adherence of the periodontopathic bacterium, B. gingivalis rather than to that of other oral bacteria including cariogenic bacteria.
TI  - [Non-groupable streptococci: identification, sensitivity to antibiotics (Charles  Nicolle Hospital in Tunis)].
AB  - 50 strains of viridans streptococci isolated from human material are identified by biochemical tests (bile esculin, Cl Na 6,5%, acid production from lactose, mannitol, sorbitol, inulin, arginine, esculin and starch hydrolysis; production of levan and dextran in sucrose media) Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus mitis are predominant species. Susceptibility to antibiotics was studied: 70% of viridans streptococci were susceptible to all antibiotics tested, high level resistance to aminoglycoside was not present. The only resistance observed were to tetracycline, macrolides and related drugs.
TI  - Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequencing of the Arthrobacter dextranase gene and its expression in Escherichia coli and Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - A bacterial strain, which assimilated dextran and water-insoluble glucan produced by Streptococcus mutans, was isolated from soil. The bacterium produced and secreted potent dextranase activity, which was identified as Arthrobacter sp. and named CB-8. The dextranase was purified and some enzymatic properties were characterized. The enzyme efficiently decomposed the water-insoluble glucan as well as dextran. A gene library from the bacteria was constructed with Escherichia coli, using plasmid pUC19, and clones producing dextranase activity were selected. Based on the result of nucleotide sequencing analysis, it was deduced that the dextranase was synthesized in CB-8 cells as a polypeptide precursor consisting of 640 amino acid residues, including 49 N-terminal amino acid residues which could be regarded as a signal peptide. In the E. coli transformant, the dextranase activity was detected mostly in the periplasmic space. The gene for the dextranase was introduced into Streptococcus sanguis, using an E. coli-S. sanguis shuttle vector that contained the promoter sequence of a gene for glucosyltransferase derived from a strain of S. mutans. The active dextranase was also expressed and accumulated in S. sanguis cells.
TI  - Analysis of adherence of Streptococcus defectivus and endocarditis-associated streptococci to extracellular matrix.
AB  - Pathogenesis of nutritionally variant streptococcal (NVS) endocarditis initiates  with bacterial attachment to and colonization of the damaged heart valve surface. Underlying extracellular matrix (ECM) exposed to the environment during damage to cardiac endothelium provides additional receptors that could be involved in bacterial adherence. The ability of NVS and endocarditis-associated streptococci to bind ECM was investigated by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system that incorporated ECM secreted by baby hamster kidney and human umbilical vein endothelial cells in culture. Streptococcus defectivus, the major species isolated from NVS endocarditis cases, bound ECM of fibroblasts and endothelial cells, indicating that the ECM molecule involved in the binding was a common constituent of diverse matrices. The specific binding of S. defectivus to ECM was demonstrated by saturation binding and specific antibody inhibition studies. Of the 15 S. defectivus strains analyzed, 13 bound ECM, whereas Streptococcus adjacens and NVS serotype III strains were unable to bind the matrix. This selective binding suggested that S. defectivus binds to heart valves through a mechanism different from those of other NVS in subacute bacterial endocarditis. A survey of non-NVS streptococcal endocarditis isolates demonstrated that S. mutans, S. mitis, S. sanguis, and S. faecalis also bound ECM, whereas other viridans species were unable to bind the matrix.
TI  - [Personal identification from antibodies to oral streptococci using ELISA].
AB  - Serum antibodies to oral streptococci were titrated by ELISA for the purpose of personal identification. The bacteria concerned comprised 9 strains of Streptococcus mutans, which are known to cause dental caries, and one strain of Streptococcus sanguis commonly found in the oral cavity and harmless to the teeth. The quantities of IgM antibodies to these streptococci were more or less dependent on the total levels of serum IgM. However, no relation was found between the IgG antibodies and the total serum levels of IgG. IgA antibodies showed a degree of correlation that was intermediate between those of the IgM and IgG antibodies. Two antibodies, anti-Streptococcus mutans PS14 (anti-SM) and anti-Streptococcus sanguis 10556 (anti-SS), were selected, because the cross-reactivities of the IgG antibodies with these streptococci were slight. The quantity ratios of IgG anti-SM antibodies and IgG anti-SS antibodies differed from person to person, ranging from about 1:1 to 1:6 in 129 healthy Japanese adults. ELISA was considered to be appropriate for assaying these antibodies because of its good intra-assay reproducibility. The IgG anti-SM/anti-SS quantity ratio was not related to sex, age or ABO blood group, and appeared to be unrelated to the "decayed, missing and filled teeth index" (DMF index). The anti-SM/anti-SS ratios were investigated for 12 months after the preparation of bloodstains. They remained almost unchanged for 8 months, although the reactivities of individual IgG antibodies began to decrease 3 to 5 months after preparation. These results indicate that the ratio of IgG anti-streptococcal antibodies in bloodstains is a very useful parameter in personal identification.
TI  - Effects of chlorhexidine on proteolytic and glycosidic enzyme activities of dental plaque bacteria.
AB  - Chlorhexidine was tested for its ability to inhibit a wide range of glycosidic and proteolytic enzyme activities produced by Treponema denticola, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Actinobacillus actinomycemcomitans, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Capnocytophaga orchracea, Capnocytophaga sp., Actinomyces viscosus, Streptococcus mitior, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus oralis and Streptococcus sanguis. The enzymes produced by Capnocytophaga spp. were the most resistant to inhibition by chlorhexidine while the hydrolysis of proteolytic substrates by all the other species was markedly susceptible to inhibition with less than 0.125 mM chlorhexidine inhibiting enzyme activities by greater than or equal to 50%. Glycosidase activities, of all species, were generally more resistant to inhibition, especially neuraminidase activity. Chlorhexidine at less than 0.032 mM inhibited the degradation of bovine serum albumin by suspensions of dental plaque bacteria. These observations support an hypothesis that chlorhexidine exerts a bacteristatic effect in vivo, in part, by reducing the ability of dental plaque bacteria to degrade host-derived proteins and glycoproteins which normally provide essential nutrients for growth.
TI  - Inhibition of adsorption of oral streptococci to saliva treated hydroxyapatite by chitin derivatives.
AB  - This study estimated the effects of five chitin derivatives low molecular chitosan (LMCS), ethyleneglycol chitin (PEGT), carboxymethyl chitin (PCMT), sulphated chitosan (PSSS), and phosphorylated chitin (PPPT) on the adsorption of three oral streptococci to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite (S-HA). The adsorption was evaluated by measuring the optical density of the bacterial cell suspensions released from saliva-treated hydroxyapatite by 0.5 N HCl. The adsorption of test strains to S-HA progressively decreased in proportion to each additional volume of PEGT, PPPT, or PSSS. PPPT and PSSS quite effectively inhibited the adsorption of S. mutans onto S-HA, but were less effective against S. sanguis and S. mitis. PPPT, PSSS, and PCMT all markedly promoted the desorption of S. mutans cells pre-adsorbed onto S-HA. Pretreatment of S-HA with PPPT, PSSS, or PCMT significantly decreased the subsequent adsorption of S. mutans and S. mitis. Pretreatment of these cells with PEGT also decreased their adsorption to S-HA. These findings suggest that these chitin derivatives may change the ionic natures of the S-HA and the bacterial cell surface, resulting in a less favorable interaction.
TI  - Polymerase chain reaction amplification, cloning, sequence determination and homologies of streptococcal ATPase-encoding DNAs.
AB  - The highly conserved portion of the catalytic subunit (beta-subunit) of the membrane-bound, proton-translocating ATPase from three strains of oral streptococci has been amplified via the polymerase chain reaction. Hybridization studies demonstrated the existence of homology between Escherichia coli and Bacillus megaterium beta-subunit probes at the streptococcal DNA level. Highly degenerate primers, based on the E. coli and B. megaterium amino acid (aa) sequences, were used to amplify the homologues in Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis and S. sobrinus. The 600 bp fragment from S. sobrinus has been cloned and its nucleotide (nt) sequence determined. Comparison of its nt and deduced aa sequence to that of E. coli and B. megaterium reveals a high degree of homology at the aa level.
TI  - Comparison of the plaque microflora from natural and appliance-borne enamel surfaces.
AB  - Human enamel sections and slabs, mounted on a mandibular removable appliance, were worn by 5 adult subjects for a 1-week period. Plaque was allowed to accumulate on the in situ test sites and on the adjacent natural dentition. At the end of the experimental period, the plaque microflora associated with (1) the enamel sections, (2) the enamel slabs, and (3) the acrylic base of the appliance test site was compared with that obtained from lingual and interproximal areas of the lower molar teeth. In addition, the acid anion and pH profiles of plaque obtained from both the exogenous and natural tooth surfaces were also determined. Although some quantitative differences were found between the proportions of isolates obtained from the different enamel surfaces, qualitatively the microflora was very similar, and no significant differences were found in the plaque lactate/acetate ratios or pH measurements following a sucrose mouthrinse. Thus, human tooth specimens mounted on the intra-oral device produced a plaque ecosystem similar to that present on the adjacent natural dentition, suggesting that the model is suitable for studies on early plaque development and the microbiology of enamel demineralization.
TI  - Mutacin activity of strains isolated from children with varying levels of mutants streptococci and caries.
AB  - A total of 157 isolates of mutants streptococci from plaque and saliva of 94 children were studied for their serotypes, mutacin production, frequency and spectrum of activity. Of these isolates 71% were identified as serotype c and 22% as serotype e. Serotypes f, d and g, and one untypable strain made up about 7% of the isolates. More than one serotype was found in 13% of the children. Mutacin was produced by 83% of the isolates against one or more of the 14 indicator strains representing mutants streptococci. Streptococcus sanguis, Strep. oralis, Strep. gordonii, Strep. salivarius and Strep. pyogenes. Isolates that had a broad inhibitory spectrum also produced larger inhibition zones than isolates that inhibited fewer strains. When evaluating the effect of mutacin in vivo on plaque ecology, it was found that the counts of mutans streptococci or the proportion of mutans streptococci in the total streptococcal count of plaque did not differ between plaques containing strains that produced much mutacin and those with little production. The findings also failed to reveal an association between caries experience and mutacin activity.
TI  - Sorbitol transport and metabolism by oral streptococci.
AB  - Sorbitol transport by oral streptococci was mediated by a phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (PTS). The transition of S. sanguis 160 from continuous growth on limiting glucose to limiting sorbitol resulted in induction of EIIsor of the sorbitol-PTS, as well as sorbitol-6-P dehydrogenase which converts sorbitol-6-P to fructose-6-P. Sorbitol transport activity required the presence of a soluble sorbitol-specific component of the PTS, tentatively identified as an enzyme III for sorbitol (IIIsor). In addition, the results indicated that sorbitol transport can be mediated by the ELLglc, particularly in the presence of the sorbitol-specific component. S. sanguis 160 utilized sorbitol in a manner different from that reported for S mutans. Growth on glucose by S. sanguis 160 was inhibited by the presence of sorbitol in the growth medium and sorbitol was utilized in the presence of glucose. In addition, pulses of glucose added to cultures growing on sorbitol resulted in expulsion of sorbitol from the cell. Sorbitol was shown to interfere with glucose metabolism by S. sanguis 160 by inhibiting glucose transport by sorbitol-limited cells, but not by glucose-limited cells, and by inhibiting glycolytic activity with glucose as the substrate. Furthermore, sorbitol was an effective repressor of the glucose-PTS, exhibiting negative regulation over synthesis of both EIIglc and a soluble component of the glucose-PTS, presumably IIIglc. Oral streptococci metabolize sorbitol to large amounts of formate and ethanol in addition to smaller amounts of lactate and acetate. The metabolism of sorbitol by S. sanguis and S. gordonii was less sensitive to oxygen than that by S. mutans and S. mitis.
TI  - Interactions of sanguinarine and zinc on oral streptococci and Actinomyces species.
AB  - Sanguinaria extract, which contains benzophenanthridine alkaloids, has been used  as a folk medicine for many years. Minimum inhibitory and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MIC and MBC values) for sanguinarine were determined for common and etiologically important plaque bacteria. Because the efficacy of sanguinarine is believed to be enhanced by zinc, isobolograms were assessed to determine their mode(s) of interaction. Hydrogen ion concentration influenced the inhibitory activity of both sanguinarine and zinc. For sanguinarine, at the optimum pH (6.5), MIC values were 4 or 8 micrograms/ml for Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus and Actinomyces naeslundii. MIC values were 0.125-0.50 mmol Zn/ml. MBC values ranged from 1 to 8 mmol Zn/ml at pH 5.5. Isobologram data revealed that sanguinarine and zinc interacted synergistically. Viadent oral rinse, which contained 300 micrograms sanguinaria extract/ml and 0.2% zinc chloride (14.9 mmol Zn/l), was inhibitory to all strains tested. MIC values were 1 or 2% (ml Viadent oral rinse/100 ml aqueous solution) for all strains except A. viscosus for which the MIC value was 12% (vol/vol).
TI  - Antimicrobial proteins in human unstimulated whole saliva in relation to each other, and to measures of health status, dental plaque accumulation and composition.
AB  - Saliva antimicrobial proteins may interact in a common system to influence the oral ecology. Clinical studies of antimicrobial protein action thus may require a multiple-protein approach. Multivariate statistical methods have been used to describe possible patterns of interaction for lysozyme, lactoferrin, salivary peroxidase and secretory IgA in stimulated parotid saliva. However, oral microbes are most likely to encounter antimicrobial proteins in mixed resting saliva. Relationships among levels of lysozyme, lactoferrin, salivary peroxidase, and secretory IgA therefore were investigated in whole saliva from 216 subjects, and an attempt made to relate interperson variation in those proteins to differences in health and status, and dental plaque accumulation and composition. All proteins were significantly (alpha = 0.05) correlated with each other (r = 0.38-0.52, p less than 0.001). There was only one axis of common variation among proteins, and that axis was significantly correlated (p less than 0.001) with total protein (r = 0.84) and flow rate (r = -0.56). That pattern deviated from the previous finding that proteins of acinar origin tended to vary independently from proteins of ductal origin in stimulated parotid saliva. The difference between parotid and whole saliva may reflect constitutive secretion of all proteins at low levels of stimulation. Common variation of unstimulated saliva proteins suggests that antimicrobial actions can be compared in subjects at population extremes. There were no significant associations between antimicrobial proteins in whole saliva and measures of health status or plaque accumulation. However, the proportions of Streptococcus sanguis were significantly correlated with lysozyme (r = -0.26), lactoferrin (r = -0.34), peroxidase (r = -0.30), total protein (r = -0.37), flow rate (r = 0.24) and principal-components scores (r = -0.33) in a subset of subjects (n = 85) where commercial biochemical tests were used to supplement species identification by colony morphology. Those findings may indicate that saliva antimicrobial proteins can affect the composition of dental plaque.
TI  - Oxygen and the sugar metabolism in oral streptococci.
AB  - Streptococci have several ways of adapting themselves to the constantly changing  environment of the human oral cavity. This paper discusses the adaptation of sugar metabolism to variations in oxygen levels. In all streptococci the Embden-Meyerhof pathway of glycolysis works under aerobic as well as anaerobic conditions, but pyruvate is converted into different metabolic end products depending on the oxygen levels. Under anaerobic conditions all streptococci form formate, acetate, and ethanol by a pyruvate formate-lyase pathway. If sugar is in excess, they also form lactate using a lactate dehydrogenase. Under aerobic conditions pyruvate formate-lyase is inactivated. This enzyme is then replaced by a pyruvate oxidase in some streptococci and by a pyruvate dehydrogenase in others. The characteristics of these enzymes help streptococci like S. sanguis, S. oralis, S. gordonii, and S. mitis to compete successfully with other bacteria in those sites of the oral cavity that are freely exposed to saliva, while mutans streptococci have to colonize anaerobic sites such as those in-between the teeth and in the occlusal fissures of the teeth.
TI  - Secretory IgA adsorption and oral streptococcal adhesion to human enamel and artificial solid substrata with various surface free energies.
AB  - In this paper, secretory IgA adsorption from a single component sIgA solution and from human whole saliva onto human enamel and artificial solid substrata with various surface free energies was studied as a function of time. ELISA indicated that screening or displacement of adsorbed sIgA by other salivary proteins occurred only on low surface free energy substrata, not on high surface free energy substrata such as enamel. In addition, the adhesion of three oral streptococcal strains (Streptococcus mitis BMS, S. sanguis 12, and S. mutans NS), also having widely different surface free energies, to sIgA-coated surfaces was studied. The adhesion of all three streptococcal strains was significantly reduced in the presence of a sIgA coating. However, ranking the adhesion data with respect to the various substrata revealed a similar order to that in the case of uncoated substrata, indicating that substratum properties were at least partly transferred by the adsorbed protein film to the interface with adhering micro-organisms. For S. sanguis 12 and S. mitis BMS, adhesion decreased proportionally with the amounts of sIgA detected by ELISA, but for S. mutans NS such relations with the amounts of sIgA detected on the protein-coated substrata were not found. Thus, for S. mutans NS a specific antibody effect seems to exist in addition to a non-specific protein effect like that observed for S. sanguis 12 and S. mitis BMS.
TI  - Influence of hydrophobicity on oligopeptide utilization by oral streptococci.
AB  - The growth responses of Streptococcus mutans VA-29R, Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556, and Streptococcus mitior NIH to hydrophilic and hydrophobic peptides obtained following isopropanol fractionation of Trypticase were compared. Although the two fractions contained peptides of similar molecular size, differences were observed with respect to amino acid compositions. S. mutans VA-29R showed a pronounced difference in growth response to hydrophilic vs. hydrophobic peptides. While growth of this micro-organism on hydrophilic peptides was indistinguishable from that on unfractionated Trypticase, only very slow growth occurred on the hydrophobic peptides. S. sanguis ATCC 10556 and S. mitior NIH also displayed some selectivity, as evidenced by their faster relative growth rates on hydrophilic, as compared with hydrophobic, peptides. The results of this study support the conclusion that the properties of the substrate, as defined by its amino acid composition, may be more important than molecular size as a factor influencing recognition and subsequent utilization of oligopeptides as sources of amino acids for growth by these three oral streptococci.
TI  - Association of selected bacteria with the lesions of root surface caries.
AB  - Plaque from the root surfaces of 165 subjects (mean age 65.5 years, 22-26 teeth/subject) was analysed for specific bacteria. Five subject groups were defined: A (DMFS 16.4), B (DMFS 55.9), C1 (DMFS 55.6), C2 (DMFS 57.0) and C3 (DMFS 48.1). Groups C1 and C2 had unrestored root surface lesions; Group A, B and C3 were free of unrestored root caries and differed in their coronal caries experience. Streptococcus mutans was isolated more frequently from the root lesions in Groups C1 and C2 than from intact root surfaces in Group A. Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis 1 and Streptococcus sanguis were isolated more frequently from Group A. The percentage contribution that S. mutans made to plaque from lesions in Groups C1 and C2 was higher than that from plaque in Group A and Actinomyces viscosus serovar 2 contributed more to plaque in Group C1 than in samples from Group A. The percentage counts of Lactobacillus in plaque from lesions in Groups C1 and C2 were higher than those from intact roots in Groups A, B, and C3. Subjects were also grouped on the presence of Lactobacillus and S. mutans in plaque samples. Samples with both organisms (n = 17) showed significantly higher isolation frequencies of specific strains of S. mitis 1 and also A. viscosus serovar 2 compared with samples of plaque containing S. mutans or Lactobacillus. Actinomyces naeslundii serovar 1 was not isolated from samples containing both S. mutans and Lactobacillus. The results confirm an association of S. mutans and Lactobacillus with root surface lesions and suggest a relationship between lesions and A. viscosus serovar 2.
TI  - Ability to bind salivary alpha-amylase discriminates certain viridans group streptococcal species.
AB  - A collection of 144 viridans group streptococcal strains recently characterized as part of a taxonomic study was examined for the ability to bind salivary alpha-amylase. This property was found in most strains of Streptococcus gordonii and Streptococcus mitis and in occasional strains of Streptococcus anginosus and Streptococcus salivarius. In contrast, all strains of Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus vestibularis, and Streptococcus mutans lacked alpha-amylase-binding capacity. A rapid and easy assay described in this paper may be an important supplementary test for identification of oral streptococci.
TI  - Arginine catabolism by strains of oral streptococci.
AB  - Arginine catabolism via the arginine deiminase pathway was found in Streptococcus sanguis 903. Citrulline and ornithine were released from resting cells incubated with arginine, arginine-containing peptides, or saliva. Maximum arginine catabolism by resting cells of S. sanguis 903 was found in the pH range 7-8 and at 45-48 degrees C. Arginine deiminase activity was found in the cytoplasm and in the cell-wall extract of this strain, while ornithine carbamoyltransferase activity was found in the cytoplasm and in extracts of cell walls and cytoplasmic membranes. Streptococcus mutans GS-5 and Streptococcus sobrinus strains OMZ 176 and 6715 could release arginine from salivary peptides but were incapable of significant arginine catabolism.
TI  - The effect of sucrose application and implantation of mutans streptococci on the  microbial composition of three-week experimental plaque--an in situ study.
AB  - This study describes the predominant cultivable microflora of three-week-old plaque samples obtained from human enamel sites, on the basis of microbial identification of over 9000 fresh isolates. Lower removable appliances, on which were mounted enamel sections and slabs, were worn by five young adult subjects under three experimental protocols. These were (1) 'normal' plaque conditions, (2) extra-oral sucrose applications nine times daily, and (3) inoculation of each subject's own mutans streptococci onto the enamel test sites and sucrose applications, as described above. With the exception of slightly higher proportions of Gram-negative bacilli associated with slab plaque following sucrose application, no significant differences in percentage or absolute counts of organisms were found between normal and sucrose plaques. The inoculation of mutans streptococci, combined with extra-oral sucrose applications, was associated with significantly higher percentages and absolute mean counts of both mutans streptococci and lactobacilli, and lower proportions of S. sanguis and S. oralis. Although the isolation frequency of mutans streptococci increased in all subjects and the overall mean proportion rose following inoculation, considerable inter-subject variation was seen in mean percentage counts of these organisms isolated from the three-week plaque samples.
TI  - Aggregation of oral bacteria by human salivary mucins in comparison to salivary and gastric mucins of animal origin.
AB  - Seventeen strains of oral bacteria of the genera Actinomyces (5), Bacteroides (3), and Streptococcus (9) were tested for aggregation by the human whole salivary mucin fraction (HWSM) in comparison to three types of animal mucin preparations from submandibular glands of cow (BSM) and sheep (OSM), and from the stomach of pig (PGM). Considerable variation was seen with respect to the rate and titer of aggregation induced by these mucins. The aggregating activity of HWSM varied widely among the different bacterial strains. The Bacteroides group showed hardly any induced aggregation, whereas the final aggregation titers varied for S. sanguis (3 strains) between 12 and 48, for S. oralis (3 strains) between 6 and 48, for the S. mutans group (3 strains) between 6 and 96, and for the five Actinomyces strains even between 6 and 192. For a particular strain, similar differences in titer were seen between the four mucins. For a human salivary mucin (MG-2) it has been described that sialic acid in the sequence NeuAc (alpha 2,3)Gal(beta 1,3)GalNac- was specifically involved in the interaction with S. sanguis strains, in contrast to S. rattus BHT. Our results, however, indicate that this sugar sequence is not a prerequisite for the aggregation of S. sanguis, as animal mucins, devoid of this structure, were equally well or even better capable of inducing aggregation. On the other hand, desialization of BSM and OSM largely abolished their aggregating capability towards S. rattus BHT. Moreover, it was found that BSM and OSM, which are comparable with respect to their major oligosaccharide structure, show considerable differences in aggregating activity towards the same bacterial strain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Identification of mutans streptococci with monoclonal antibodies.
AB  - Mutans streptococci have been correlated with dental caries. The identification of the species within this group is still a problem. The characterization of a monoclonal antibody (Mab) OMVU10 against S. sobrinus as well as the isolation and characterization of Mabs against S. mutans (OMVU30 and OMVU31), S. cricetus (OMVU40) and mutans streptococci (OMVU2) is described. The epitope specificity for OMVU10 and OMVU31 was cell-wall antigen B in both cases although both Mabs recognized different species-specific epitopes. OMVU40 was cross reactive with Streptococcus sanguis taxon 3. All other Mabs were specific for one species. Using these Mabs, a key to the identification of mutans streptococci is developed. This key was tested for 85 wild type isolates of mutans streptococci and proved to be highly reliable and easy to perform.
TI  - An investigation into the mechanism of protection by local passive immunization with monoclonal antibodies against Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Local oral passive immunization with Streptococcus mutans-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb) (Guy's 13) prevented recolonization by indigenous S. mutans in human volunteers who had first been treated with a conventional antibacterial agent (chlorhexidine). The F(ab')2 fragment of the MAb was as protective as the intact immunoglobulin G, but the Fab fragment of the molecule failed to prevent recolonization of S. mutans. In subjects receiving the MAb Fab fragment, S. mutans levels in dental plaque and saliva reappeared at a similar rate to that found in sham-immunized subjects who received either saline or a nonprotective MAb. In vitro, MAb had no bacteriostatic or bacteriocidal effect on S. mutans. However, S. mutans grown in the presence of either intact immunoglobulin G MAb or the F(ab')2 fragment formed very long chains, which resulted in clumping of the cells. S. mutans grown with either saline or the MAb Fab fragment formed significantly shorter chains, more characteristic of streptococcal growth in liquid media. The results suggest that the two binding sites of the MAb molecule may be an essential feature for preventing streptococcal colonization but that the ability to bind to phagocytes and activate complement which resides in the Fc fragment is not essential. Protection against colonization by S. mutans lasting up to 2 years was observed in immunized subjects, although MAb was applied over a period of only 3 weeks. Furthermore, functional MAb was detected up to 3 days following application of MAb to the teeth. The long-term protection could not be accounted for by a persistence of MAb on the tooth surface, and we have suggested that it may be due to a shift in the balance of the oral flora which discouraged recolonization by S. mutans. However, examination of the proportions of Streptococcus sanguis and veillonella species in the recolonization experiments failed to reveal a significant change in the proportions of either organism, which returned to approximately the preexperimental levels in both the immunized and control groups. These findings confirm the in vivo functional specificity of the MAb to S. mutans but are not consistent with the suggestion that S. sanguis or veillonella take over the niche vacated by S. mutans, unless the shift in the proportion of these organisms cannot be detected by the method used.
TI  - [Oral Streptococci - a scheme for the identification of Streptococcus mutans].
AB  - A reliable simple scheme for the rapid identification of certain species of oral  streptococci has been developed and compared with biochemical and physiological results of 45 well known clinical isolates and stock strains. Moreover, a method for the determination of H2O2 production was tested. With selected reactions as for instance acid formation in mannitol and raffinose broth, hydrolysis of arginine and esculin, the production of peroxidase, and the resistance of bacitracin the species S. rattus, S. sobrinus, S. mutans, S. cricetus, S. ferus, S. milleri, S. mitis, S. sanguis, S. mitior, and S. salivarius were differentiated.
TI  - Use of modified norleucine-tyrosine broth in identification of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
AB  - Gas-liquid chromatography was employed to analyze the volatile and nonvolatile acids produced in modified norleucine-tyrosine (MNT) broth by various gram-positive cocci. The MNT broth consists of 0.5% Trypticase (BBL Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, Md.), 0.5% yeast extract (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Mich.), 0.2% L-norleucine, and 0.1% L-tyrosine. The microorganisms included reference strains and clinical isolates of Peptostreptococcus spp. (P. anaerobius, P. asaccharolyticus, P. indolicus, P. magnus, and P. prevotii), Staphylococcus spp. (S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. saccharolyticus), and Streptococcus spp. (S. agalactiae, S. intermedius, S. mutans, S. sanguis I, and S. sanguis II). Only Peptostreptococcus anaerobius strains produced caproic and valeric acids in MNT broth cultures. All 11 P. anaerobius strains produced valeric acid in MNT broth, and only 1 strain failed to produce caproic acid in the medium. This unique feature aids in rapid, reliable identification of P. anaerobius with a minimum number of tests.
TI  - Effect of a triclosan/copolymer/fluoride dentifrice on the oral microflora.
AB  - Eighty-one human subjects completed a double-blind study which examined the effects of a 0.3% triclosan/2% Gantrez copolymer/0.243% sodium fluoride dentifrice on the microflora of supragingival dental plaque. Subjects were divided into an experimental group which performed normal oral hygiene with the triclosan/copolymer/fluoride dentifrice and a control group which also performed normal oral hygiene with the same dentifrice minus the triclosan/copolymer. At baseline, 10 weeks, and 28 weeks, supragingival dental plaque was collected from buccal and lingual surfaces of the four first molar teeth and assayed for: 1) bacterial morphotypes by phase contrast microscopy, 2) Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Actinomyces species, Bacteroides forsythus, Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, and Wolinella recta by immunofluorescence microscopy, and 3) Lactobacillus, yeast, enterics, Staphylococcus, aerobes and anaerobes by bacterial culture. After 28 weeks' use of their respective dentifrices, changes in the supragingival plaque microflora of the subjects were similar between the triclosan/copolymer/fluoride dentifrice group and the control dentifrice group, except for statistically significant reductions in fusiforms, spirochetes and staphylococci and significant increases in S. sanguis in the triclosan/copolymer/fluoride dentifrice group, as compared to the control dentifrice group. The subject population was unusual in the presence of enteric species and anaerobes found in supragingival plaque sites. This study indicates that the use of a dentifrice containing 0.3% triclosan and 2% Gantrez copolymer over an extended period of time (28 weeks) does not result in shifts in the microflora of supragingival plaque favoring the growth of either opportunistic or pathogenic bacterial species.
TI  - Comparison of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis receptors for human  salivary agglutinin.
AB  - Oral streptococci vary in their susceptibility to salivary agglutinin-mediated aggregation. To understand the molecular basis of this specificity, the structure and function of receptors for agglutinin from Streptococcus mutans KPSK2 (MSL-1) and Streptococcus sanguis M5 (SSP-5) were compared. Immunological screening of an S. mutans KPSK2 genomic DNA library yielded two identical clones expressing a streptococcal protein that co-migrated with a 220 kDa peptide in SDS extracts from this organism. This protein inhibited agglutinin-mediated aggregation of S. mutans KPSK2 in a dose-dependent manner. The MSL-1 gene is homologous to the S. mutans SpaP and pac genes although single base substitutions alter several amino acids. MSL-1 is also similar to the agglutinin receptor (SSP-5) cloned from S. sanguis M5. All three proteins, MSL-1, P1, and SSP-5 share at least one epitope since monoclonal and polyclonal anti-SSP-5 antibodies react with both MSL-1 and P1. However, other monoclonal antibodies are specific for SSP-5 and appear to react with a peptide domain exhibiting little homology to MSL-1 or P1. Sugar inhibition studies showed that agglutinin-mediated aggregation of S. mutans KPSK2 was most potently inhibited by fucose and lactose. Sialic acid, a potent inhibitor of S. sanguis aggregation, had no effect on the interaction of agglutinin with S. mutans KPSK2. These results suggest that while the MSL-1 and SSP-5 proteins are genetically and immunologically related, their specificity for binding sites on agglutinin differs.
TI  - Incidence of bacteriocinogeny among fresh isolates of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Among 139 Streptococcus mutans fresh isolates tested, using the deferred-antagonism test and Streptococcus sanguis Ny 101 as the indicator strain, we observed that the frequency of detection of inhibition zones was reduced by 19% (from 53 to 34%) when arginine (1%) was used in the overlay agar. Among pigmented strains, the frequency of mutacin-like production was 70%. The frequency with which inhibition zones were detected varied from 7 to 91%, depending on the indicator strain used. These results indicate that the ability to detect the presence of mutacin-like substances varies widely and is dependent to a great extent on the methodology used.
TI  - [Ecosystem of microbial flora in periodontal pockets, in vitro].
AB  - This study was designed to analyze the succession of an ecosystem of microbial flora in periodontal pockets, in vitro. Bacterial strains used in this study, were Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 10953, Porphyromonas gingivalis 381, Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10557 and Streptococcus mutans OMZ 176. The bacterial cells, associated with beneficial, pathogenic or plaque forming activity, were cultured in brain heart infusion medium including hemin, vitamin-K1, L-cysteine hydrochloride and sodium thioglycollate under anaerobic condition (N2: 80%, CO2: 10%, H2: 10%). The effect of environmental Eh and pH on the growth of bacterial cells was investigated in single and mixed culture, and Eh and pH tolerance tests were also undertaken. The environmental pH decreased from pH 7.0 to pH 4.9 accompanied with the growth of S. mutans OMZ 176 and S. sanguis ATCC 10557 in both single and mixed culture. The environmental Eh increased from -308 mV to -180 mV accompanied with the growth of S. sanguis ATCC 10557. The growth of pathogenic bacteria, such as F. nucleatum ATCC 10953 and P. gingivalis 381, varied markedly with Eh and pH. Especially, the growth of P. gingivalis 381 was severely inhibited at or below pH 6.0 in an acid tolerance test, whereas the growth of F. nucleatum ATCC 10953 was strongly inhibited at Eh -100 mV in an Eh tolerance test. The oxygen generation (10.8%) was confirmed in the anaerobic culture of S. sanguis ATCC 10557. Therefore, it was suggested that hydrogen peroxide produced by S. sanguis ATCC 10557 was reduced to oxygen and water. These results suggest that the high Eh and the low pH generated from bacterial metabolism is a powerful determinant in ecology of microbial flora in periodontal pockets.
TI  - Adherence of mutans streptococci to other oral bacteria.
AB  - Adherence of mutans streptococci to strains of Actinomyces viscosus, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus mitis immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane was measured. Strains of Streptococcus mutans, S. sobrinus, and S. rattus bound in a lactose-independent manner to a variety of the actinomyces and streptococci. Most of these reactions could proceed in the presence of whole saliva although adherence of S. rattus BHT to the streptococci was inhibited by salivary molecules. In contrast, adherence of S. mutans 10449 and KPSK2 to A. viscosus, S. sanguis, and S. mitis was enhanced by salivary molecules. S. mutans KPSK2, S. sobrinus OMZ 176, and S. rattus FA-1 binding to A. viscosus NC3 and S. sanguis G9B exhibited saturation kinetics. Adherence to A. viscosus NC3 was of a higher avidity than adherence to S. sanguis G9B. Attachment of S. mutans KPSK2 to S. sanguis G9B and of S. mutans OMZ 176 to A. viscosus NC3 and S. sanguis G9B was inhibited by heat treatment of the mutans streptococci. Attachment of S. mutans KPSK2 to A. viscosus NC3 and of S. rattus FA-1 to A. viscosus NC3 and S. sanguis G9B was unaffected by heat. These observations suggest that the mutans streptococci can adhere to a variety of early plaque bacteria by several distinct mechanisms. Such interactions may be important in the colonization of tooth surfaces by the mutans streptococci.
TI  - Sialidase activity of the "Streptococcus milleri group" and other viridans group  streptococci.
AB  - Viridans group streptococci were examined for the production of sialidase (neuraminidase) activity, using the fluorescent substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-alpha-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid in a simple and rapid (15-min) assay. Sialidase was produced by all strains of Streptococcus oralis and S. intermedius and by a majority of S. mitis strains. S. mutans, S. sobrinus, S. gordonii, S. sanguis, S. vestibularis, S. salivarius, S. anginosus, S. constellatus, "S. parasanguis," and the "tufted fibril group" were uniformly negative. Sialidase production may be a useful characteristic to assist in the identification of viridans group streptococci.
TI  - [Initial-plaque forming ability of glucosyltransferases from Streptococcus mutans serotype C strain].
AB  - In order to clarify functional roles of extracellular glucosyltransferases (GTases) from S. mutans serotype c in initial stage of plaque formation, GTase-I and GTase-S were purified from culture fluids of strain PS 14. And an ability of these GTases to enhance cellular attachment of oral streptococci was investigated using 3H labeled resting cells of S. sanguis Challis and S. milleri Is 57. The results were as follows: 1) From culture fluids of strain PS 14 grown in a M 4 medium supplemented with 1% ammonium sulfate, GTase-I was purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation, CM-cellurose column chromatography and Toyopearl HW-55 gelfiltration. Also, GTase-S was purified by the method of Baba et al from the culture fluids of strain PS 14 grown in a dialyzed BHI medium. Purified GTase-I and GTase-S were almost homogeneous, and had a molecular size of 160 KDa and 145 KDa respectively (by SDS-PAGE). 2) Sucrose-dependent attachment of S. sanguis cells to experimental pellicles was markedly enhanced by the addition of crude GTase in saliva. This fact was conformed by a scanning electron microscopic observation of the attachment cells. Such enhanced attachment necessitated a long-term incubation (greater than 10 h) of the cells in the presence of sucrose, suggesting that it is correlated to de novo glucan synthesis. 3) Purified GTase-I also had an ability to enhance the cellular attachment of S. sanguis cells as well as crude GTase, while purified GTase-S didn't have. Neither crude enzyme, GTase-I nor GTase-S have an ability to enhance significantly the cellular attachment of S. milleri cells. However, S. milleri pretreated with the preparations containing GTase-S gained the ability to attach to experimental pellicles prepared from saliva supplemented with GTase-I. These results suggest that the cellular attachment system mediated by enzymatic action (s) of GTase (s) from serotype c S. mutans be present and function in the first stage of plaque formation.
TI  - [Molecular cloning and expression of a dextranase gene from Arthrobacter in Streptococcus sanguis].
AB  - The gene coding for a dextranase activity of Arthrobacter CB-8, named dex gene, was isolated and cloned into Escherichia coli and into Streptococcus sanguis. The gene library was screened by transparent halo formation around the colonies grown on agar medium containing blue dextran. DNA fragment consisting of about 3,200 base pairs was prepared for further cloning procedures. Dextranase activity was detected in the periplasmic space of E. coli clones, using pUC19, pVA 838 and their derivatives. Dex gene was also introduced into S. sanguis Challis using pVA 838, a plasmid that is able to replicate in both E. coli and S. sanguis. But the clones did not express the dex gene. For the expression of dex gene in S. sanguis, a new shuttle vector was constructed, which contained the promoter region of a glucosyltransferase gene from S. mutans as well as the terminator region of ribosomal RNA from E. coli. The plasmid was designated pMNK. Using pMNK as vector, dex gene was expressed in S. sanguis. Dextranase activity was detected in the cellular fraction of the clones.
TI  - Streptococcal-host interactions. Structural and functional analysis of a Streptococcus sanguis receptor for a human salivary glycoprotein.
AB  - Colonization of oral tissues by Streptococcus sanguis may be influenced by a mucin-like salivary glycoprotein (SAG) through a calcium-dependent interaction with a specific bacterial receptor. We report the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of the S. sanguis receptor (SSP-5) and show that this protein may bind sialic acid residues of SAG. The SSP-5 protein contains three unique structural domains, two of which consist of repetitive amino acid sequences. The N-terminal domain is comprised of four tandem copies of an 82-residue repeat which exhibits homology to M protein of Streptococcus pyogenes. This region is highly charged and predicted to be alpha-helical. A second hydrophilic repetitive domain consists of three copies of a 39-amino acid sequence containing 30% proline flanked by nonrepetitive proline-rich sequence. The third domain consists of 48% proline and resides near the C terminus of the protein. Secondary structure analysis of the SSP-5 sequence also identified four potential helix-turn-helix motifs that resembled E-F hand calcium binding domains. The SSP-5 protein is highly homologous to a surface antigen expressed by the mutans streptococci and the domain structure of SSP-5 is conserved within this family of proteins. The interactions of SSP-5 and of intact S. sanguis with SAG were inhibited by neuraminidase digestion of the salivary glycoprotein and by simple sugars containing sialic acid, suggesting that sialic acid is the primary ligand involved in the binding reaction.
TI  - Microbiology of root surface caries in humans.
AB  - Studies on the microbiology of root surface caries between 1970 and 1975 placed emphasis on Gram-positive pleomorphic filamentous rods, particularly Actinomyces viscosus and Actinomyces naeslundii. Both of these species had been shown to produce root surface caries in experimental animals. Since this time, studies have placed more emphasis on Streptococcus mutans, and S. mutans and Lactobacillus are significant in prediction of root surface caries risk in patients. Subsequent studies confirmed an association between S. mutans and 'soft' or 'initial' root lesions. Thus, it is important when determining the microflora of root surface lesions to make careful characterization of the state of the lesion. A second important aspect of the analysis of bacterial communities associated with root surface caries is better definition of the organisms. Most studies have concentrated on 'target organisms' S. mutans, S. sanguis, A. viscosus, A. naeslundii, Lactobacillus, and Veillonella. However, it has been known for 17 years that the Actinomyces associated with the lesions may be variants of A. viscosus and A. naeslundii. Such strains (intermediate strains) have been described in taxonomic studies of Actinomyces, yet little is known of the differences in physiology of these strains or their relationship to root surface caries. A similar situation exists with oral Streptococcus where new taxonomic divisions are being proposed. Recognition of the potential diversity within the 'target' genera of root surface caries could yield valuable data. Recent studies suggest that this is so, since samples from root surface lesions which contain S. mutans and Lactobacillus show a high isolation of S. mitis 1 and no isolations of A. naeslundii. Careful definition of the lesions of root surface caries and the flora will allow analysis to relate a specific bacterial community to the state fo the lesion and assist in monitoring the control of the lesion through fluoride and antibacterials.
TI  - Coaggregation of Streptococcus sanguis and other streptococci with Candida albicans.
AB  - Thirteen strains of viridans group streptococci and two strains of other streptococci were tested for coaggregation with Candida albicans. Streptococcus sanguis strains generally exhibited low levels of adherence to 28 degrees C-grown exponential-phase yeast cells, but starvation of yeast cells for glucose at 37 degrees C (or at 28 degrees C) increased their coaggregating activity with these streptococci by at least tenfold. This was a property common to four C. albicans strains tested, two of which were able to form mycelia (6406 and MEN) and two of which were not (MM2002 and CA2). The expression of the coaggregation adhesin during yeast cell starvation was inhibited by addition of trichodermin or amphotericin B. The strains of S. sanguis, Streptococcus gordonii, and Streptococcus oralis tested for coaggregating activity encompassed a diverse range of physiological and morphological types, yet all exhibited saturable coaggregation with starved C. albicans cells. There was no correlation of cell surface hydrophobicity, of either yeast or streptococcal cells, with their abilities to coaggregate. Strains of Streptococcus anginosus also coaggregated with starved yeast cells; Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus pyogenes coaggregated to a lesser degree with C. albicans, and the coaggregation with S. pyogenes was not promoted by yeast cell starvation; Streptococcus mutans and Enterococcus faecalis did not coaggregate with yeast. The coaggregation reactions of S. sanguis and S. gordonii with C. albicans were inhibited by EDTA and by heat or protease treatment of the yeast cells and were not reversible by the addition of lactose or other simple sugars. These observations extend the range of intergeneric coaggregations that are known to occur between oral microbes and suggest that coaggregations of C. albicans with viridans group streptococci may be important for colonization of oral surfaces by the yeast.
TI  - Surface-associated properties of Streptococcus milleri group strains and their potential relation to pathogenesis.
AB  - Thirty strains from the Streptococcus milleri (anginosus) group (SMG) obtained from various sources were tested for a range of characters that could be associated with pathogenicity and the results were compared with those for type strains of S. sanguis, S. mutans and S. pyogenes. The SMG strains were heterogeneous in all tests. Most (18) belonged to one of the Lancefield groups with group F predominating. Adherence of strains isolated from abscesses to buccal epithelial cells was greater than that of other strains (p = 0.033). Compared with strains of S. sanguis, SMG strains were generally not aggregated by human saliva. They differed from the type strain of S. pyogenes in their relative ability to bind fibrinogen and fibronectin; they were less effective in binding fibrinogen (0.33-4.28% cf. 22% for S. pyogenes) and generally more effective in binding fibronectin (0.49-12.37% cf. 0.95%). Strains isolated from infections were statistically better at binding fibronectin than other strains (p less than 0.001). The ability of strains to adhere to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (SHA) varied 10-fold, from 0.16-16.35%. The amount of fibronectin bound by SMG strains correlated with their ability to adhere to SHA (p less than 0.001). The hydrophobicity of the strains, as measured in the hexadecane partition assay, ranged from 0.0% to 99.0%. Some strains carried both positive and negative cell-surface charges and some strains with a highly hydrophobic cell surface also possessed a relatively high cell-surface charge. A minority of strains possessed a net positive cell-surface charge. Neither hydrophobicity nor cell-surface charge was related to the capacity of strains to adhere to SHA. Strains of SMG co-aggregated weakly with strains of Veillonella parvula, V. dispar, Actinomyces viscosus and A. naeslundii.
TI  - Utilization of mucin by oral Streptococcus species.
AB  - The ability of oral Streptococcus strains to utilize oligosaccharide chains in mucin as a source of carbohydrate was studied in batch cultures. Pig gastric mucin, as a substitute of human salivary mucin, was added to chemically defined medium containing no other carbohydrates. Strains of S. mitior attained the highest cell density, while mutans streptococci: S. mutans, S. sobrinus, S. rattus, grew very little in the medium with mucin. S. mitis, S. sanguis, and S. milleri in decreasing order, showed intermediate growth. Mucin breakdown as measured by sugar analyses indicated that oligosaccharide chains were only partially degraded. Every strain produced one or more exoglycosidases potentially involved in hydrolysis of oligosaccharide. The enzyme activities occurred mainly associated with the cells, and very little activity was found in the culture fluids. The relationships between glycosidase activities and growth, or mucin degradation were not always clear.
TI  - [Xylitol, mechanisms of action and uses].
AB  - Xylitol is recommended as a sugar substitute and is claimed not only to be non-cariogenic, but also to exhibit an anti-caries effect. An interesting aspect of xylitol is that it has a certain bacteriostatic effect. Xylitol is taken up by many strains of Strep mutans and Strep sanguis even if these organisms are unable to metabolize xylitol. It enters the bacteria by the phospho-transferase system. Xylitol-phosphate inhibits the glycolysis probably at the phosphofructokinase level, and is also de-phosphorylated and expelled through a "futile cycle". The combination xylitol and sorbitol is particularly interesting, since xylitol inhibits the metabolization of sorbitol by Strep mutans and sorbitol also appears to potentiate the bacteriostatic effect of xylitol. Furthermore the combination is favourable from an economical point of view since sorbitol is less expensive than xylitol. Xylitol induces diarrhea if consumed in considerable amounts and is thus only suitable in products like chewing gum and tablets.
TI  - Stimulation of the growth of Streptococcus sanguis (NCTC 7864) by zinc in vitro.
AB  - Zinc, which is present in many materials used in dentistry, including restorative and endodontic materials and mouthwashes, is reputedly bactericidal. However, the addition of this element at concentrations in the range 10-50 ppm to cultures of Streptococcus sanguis (NCTC 7864) stimulated the growth of the micro-organism relative to that of controls. A second antibacterial element, namely fluoride, reduced growth. Similar results were obtained whether the organism was grown aerobically or anaerobically. In view of the susceptibility of some organisms to zinc, the results of this study may help to explain conflicting reports in the literature; the results will vary depending on which organism is predominant.
TI  - Colonization resistance of defined bacterial plaques to Streptococcus mutans implantation on teeth in a model mouth.
AB  - We investigated the ability of Streptococcus mutans C67-1 to colonize simple bacterial plaques and the effects of age and stability of the pre-formed plaque on colonization resistance. Mixed-plaques of Actinomyces viscosus WVU627, 'Streptococcus mitior' LPA-1, and Veillonella dispar OMZ193 were grown on tooth segments, mounted back to back for simulation of approximal sites in a model mouth for 66 h. S. mutans C67-1 was either included in the original inoculum or super-inoculated onto the developing plaque. Inclusion of S. mutans C67-1 did not alter the total viable counts, but the proportional composition changed due to inter-species interactions. Colonization resistance of the mixed-plaque samples developed within 24 h, although S. mutans C67-1 was always able to colonize these stagnation sites. Colonization resistance of 24-hour plaque against a fresh isolate, S. mutans CP3, was also studied. There was greater colonization resistance by the basic plaque to this organism, compared with S. mutans C67-1, although the reasons for this were not clear. These initial experiments demonstrate the way in which the factors involved in bacterial colonization resistance in microbial films on teeth can be studied under controlled conditions.
TI  - Proteolytic activity of oral streptococci.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus were the least proteolytic of 8 species of oral streptococci while Streptococcus oralis and Streptococcus sanguis were the most proteolytic. Degradation of FITC-BSA was significantly correlated with the hydrolysis of synthetic endopeptidase substrates. As S. oralis strains proliferate in dental plaque in the absence of dietary food their success, in vivo, might be due partially to their greater proteolytic activity compared to other oral streptococci.
TI  - Sorbitol-fermenting predominant cultivable flora of human dental plaque in relation to sorbitol adaptation and salivary secretion rate.
AB  - The sorbitol-fermenting predominant flora of human dental plaque was studied in 12 people with low and 11 with normal salivary secretion rates before and after a period of frequent mouth rinses with sorbitol solution. A total of 277 sorbitol-fermenting isolates are described by their morphological and physiological characteristics. The flora was almost exclusively composed of gram-positive bacteria belonging to the genera Streptococcus, Lactobacillus and Actinomyces in people with low secretion rates and Streptococcus and Actinomyces in those with normal salivation. At the species level, Streptococcus mutans predominated in all. The frequent use of sorbitol resulted in an increase of the streptococcal species mainly and particularly of Streptococcus sanguis I in people with normal salivation. The counts of lactobacilli and Actinomyces remained unaffected. Almost all isolates appeared to belong to the resident plaque flora. Succession of new sorbitol-fermenting genera to the plaque community could not be observed as a result of the frequent exposure of the mouth to sorbitol.
TI  - Cohesion between oral streptococci and Neisseria pharyngis on saliva-coated glass, in the presence and absence of sucrose.
AB  - Ten strains of oral streptococci, comprising nine species, were screened for their in vitro cohesive interactions with a freshly isolated strain of Neisseria pharyngis. Strains of mutans streptococci, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis I, Streptococcus milleri and Streptococcus mitis were able to cohere with N. pharyngis cells attached to a salivary pellicle adsorbed to glass. The cohesion was either due to coaggregation between the different genera or modification of the salivary pellicle by N. pharyngis MW2. S. sanguis II and Streptococcus oralis strains could not cohere with the N. pharyngis strain. Extracellular polysaccharide formed from sucrose was found to mediate cohesion between certain strains of mutans streptococci or S. oralis and N. pharyngis MW2.
TI  - Isolation of acid producing sorbitol-adapted bacteria from dental plaque using selective agar media.
AB  - Acidogenic bacteria metabolizing sorbitol were isolated and identified from dental plaque of twenty nine volunteers, claiming to be users (sixteen) and non-users (thirteen) of sorbitol-containing chewing gum and candy. Sixty bacterial strains were isolated, using improved selective agar media. The taxonomy of twenty strains, all Gram-positive cocci, was determined employing a customized BBL MinitekR system and other biochemical reactions. The majority of these strains represented Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus acidominimus. Although sorbitol-metabolizing bacteria were found in plaque specimens of most persons tested, a larger number of acidogenic sorbitol degrading bacteria was detected in the plaque of the volunteer group claiming to use sorbitol-containing sweets. Bacteriological results indicate that frequent consumption of sorbitol-containing products will lead to a shift in oral ecology, numerically favouring sorbitol-metabolizing bacteria. These sorbitol adapted bacteria appear to be as acidogenic as Streptococcus mutans in the presence of ordinary sugars.
TI  - Comparison of the initial streptococcal microflora on dental enamel in caries-active and in caries-inactive individuals.
AB  - This study compared the initial (4 h) microflora on enamel in 7 caries-active and in 7 caries-inactive adolescents. In both groups the microflora was dominated by streptococci which comprised 61 and 78% (median values) of the total viable counts in caries-active and caries-inactive individuals, respectively (p less than 0.01). Identification of a total of 700 streptococcal isolates according to a recently revised classification showed that the predominant streptococci belonged to the species Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis biovar 1, and Streptococcus sanguis. Early plaque from caries-inactive individuals differed from that of caries-active individuals by significantly higher proportions of S. sanguis (p less than 0.05) and IgA1 protease producing streptococci (p less than 0.05). In caries-active individuals, there was a tendency to elevated levels of S. mitis biovar 1 (p less than 0.10). In addition, caries-active individuals were colonized by significantly higher numbers of mutans streptococci on the enamel surfaces (p less than 0.01). However, in both groups Streptococcus mutans (serotype c) comprised less than or equal to 2% of the early streptococcal flora. Streptococcus gordonii, S. mitis biovar 2, and Streptococcus salivarius were present in low proportions and did not show differences in distribution that could be related to caries activity. The observed differences in the composition of the early streptococcal microflora may be a factor that governs the eventual cariogenic potential of dental plaque.
TI  - [The effect of zinc chloride mouthwashes on caries-inducing plaque streptococci.  3. The antibacterial effect of zinc chloride on the species Str. mutans, Str. sanguis and Str. salivarius in dental plaque].
AB  - The quantitative behaviour of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus salivarius has been examined in initial findings and after application of 0.4% zinc chloride solution. After a 7 day rinsing the number of colony developing units of the species Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis in the plaque decreased to about 30% of the determined initial values. The proportions of the species Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis in the total streptococcus flora of the dental plaque were not changed by zinc chloride solution. The percentage of the Streptococcus salivarius increased significantly from 1% to 4% of the total number of streptococci.
TI  - [The effect of zinc chloride mouthwashes on caries-inducing plaque streptococci.  1. In vitro research on the antimicrobial efficacy of zinc chloride on reference strains of Streptococcus mutans (BHT), Streptococcus sanguis (HKop) and Streptococcus salivarius (NCTN 8618)].
AB  - The antimicrobial efficiency of zinc chloride solution in concentration from 0.1% to 2.0% and 0.2% chlorhexidine solution has been examined on the strains of reference in a comparative study. Three test methods were applied: the agar diffusion test, the dilution test and the suspension test. As was to be expected the antibacterial effect of the zinc chloride solution was dependent on concentration. Between 0.1% and 2.0% the zinc chloride solution showed a bacteriostatic effect on the strains of reference only; the application of higher concentrated solutions is not indicated intraorally. 0.2% chlorhexidine solution showed a bactericidal effect on the test germs.
TI  - Effect of pH on acid production from sorbitol in washed cell suspensions of oral  bacteria.
AB  - The acid production from sorbitol and glucose was studied under anaerobic conditions in resting cell suspensions of bacteria from the predominant sorbitol-fermenting human dental plaque flora, belonging to the genera Streptococcus, Lactobacillus and Actinomyces. The acid production activity of the bacterial cells was followed by titration with alkali, at environmental pH 7.0, 6.0 and 5.0 after addition of carbohydrate solution. The metabolic end products formed in the suspensions were analyzed thereafter by isotachophoretic and enzymatic methods. The results showed that sorbitol was fermented at a slower rate than glucose. Lowering the environmental pH decreased the acid production activity from the two carbohydrates. Compared with glucose, the catabolism of sorbitol was affected to greater extent by the pH conditions. The total amount of acids formed from sorbitol was considerably less than from glucose. Lactic acid, which was the major end product in glucose-challenged suspensions, was produced only in low concentrations from sorbitol by all strains tested. The ratio strong (formic + lactic)/weak acids was moreover lower for sorbitol than for glucose. The present results further illustrate some of the mechanisms behind the low cariogenic potential of this sugar substitute.
TI  - Properties of a phosphocarrier protein (HPr) extracted from intact cells of Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - Cells of Streptococcus sanguis strain Challis were incubated with sodium lauroylsarcosinate to extract surface proteins. A polypeptide of apparent molecular mass 16 kDa comprising about 12% of the extract was purified using anion-exchange chromatography. The polypeptide was shown to be a phosphocarrier protein (HPr) that could also be found in the soluble (cytoplasmic) fraction from cells broken by homogenization with glass beads. In vivo labelling of S. sanguis cells with 32Pi showed that the polypeptide carried a heat- and acid-stable phosphorylation and that during sucrose starvation the HPr became dephosphorylated. Antiserum raised to the S. sanguis HPr reacted on Western blots with HPrs from all oral streptococci tested, together with strains of S. pyogenes and S. salivarius, but not with HPrs from S. faecalis or S. bovis, nor with proteins from Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Actinomyces viscosus and various lactobacilli. The S. sanguis HPr had a high content of alanine (17.2%) and was similar in overall amino acid composition to the HPrs from S. mutans an S. salivarius. The N-terminal residues (to 37) of the S. sanguis HPr showed strong sequence identity (82%) with the N-terminal sequence of S. faecalis HPr. It is suggested that HPr in S. sanguis is associated closely with the cytoplasmic membrane. Non-disruptive methods of removing cell-surface proteins from streptococci effect release of HPr and possibly other cytoplasmic components.
TI  - Cultural and electronmicroscopic studies of the effect of penicillin on tolerant  oral streptococci.
AB  - Penicillin-tolerant and -sensitive strains of oral streptococci were treated with penicillin to determine the production of a post-antibiotic effect (PAE). No PAE was seen with any of the S. sanguis strains tested but most strains of the other oral streptococcal species produced a PAE. Cultures on nitrocellulose filters treated with penicillin were examined by scanning electronmicroscopy and showed that tolerant and sensitive strains lost the ability to adhere to the filter after application of antibiotic. When the filters were treated with beta-lactamase, before processing for microscopy, the tolerant strains but not the sensitive ones recovered and grew in a confluent lawn similar to the control cultures that had not received antibiotic. Transmission electronmicroscopic examination of similarly treated cultures produced comparable results. Bizarre morphological changes were a feature of the tolerant strains of S. sanguis.
TI  - Effects of varnishes containing chlorhexidine on the human dental plaque flora.
AB  - This study describes the effects of varnishes containing 0%, 10%, 20%, or 40% chlorhexidine diacetate on the microflora of human fissure dental plaque. Sandarac, a natural resin, was used as the varnish base. Ten subjects, each with at least four sound fissures harboring high levels of Streptococcus mutans, participated in the study. The fissures in each of the individuals were randomly assigned to four experimental groups, in each of which one of the varnishes was tested. The varnish treatment consisted of a single application of a small amount of varnish onto the fissures. Apart from the selected fissures, the rest of the dentition was left untreated. All chlorhexidine-containing varnishes selectively suppressed S. mutans in fissure plaque, and had no effect on total viable counts or on the numbers of Actinomyces viscosus/naeslundii and Streptococcus sanguis beyond one week. The extent of the suppression depended upon the concentration of chlorhexidine in the varnish, 40% chlorhexidine varnish giving the greatest suppression of S. mutans. At 22 weeks, after a single treatment with varnish containing 40% chlorhexidine, mean S. mutans counts were more than ten times lower than in the control or 10%-chlorhexidine varnish group. At that time, S. mutans was still undetectable in five out of ten experimental fissures in this group. The results suggested that sandarac varnishes containing high concentrations of chlorhexidine can be used successfully for long-term suppression of S. mutans in dental fissures.
TI  - The microflora associated with the development of initial enamel decalcification  below orthodontic bands in vivo in children living in a fluoridated-water area.
AB  - Thirty-four caries-free teeth destined for orthodontic extraction were banded to  provide a protected area for the accumulation of plaque. The teeth were extracted at one, two, four, eight, and 14 days after being banded, and samples of the flora below the band were analyzed for the presence of Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus 'mitior', 'mutans streptococci', Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Lactobacillus species, and Veillonella. After plaque sampling, the teeth were sent to the Royal Dental College (Copenhagen) for histological analysis. The results showed that S. mutans could colonize the area below the band after one day, but that colonization was only 100% at 14 days. Lactobacillus was only isolated from 2/8 samples at four days and from 4/8 samples at 14 days. S. sanguis and 'S. mitior' were regularly isolated at all banding times, and Veillonella was isolated from all samples. A. viscosus was the most commonly isolated Actinomyces. The numbers of Streptococcus and Veillonella were significantly higher at day 1 than at day 14 (p less than 0.05). S. mutans and A. viscosus were isolated more frequently at day 14 than at day 1 (p less than 0.01). Histological examination revealed that dissolution of the enamel below a band could occur after two days, but that even after 14 days dissolution could be questionable. Dissolution was detected in areas where S. mutans was not isolated (8/34), but S. mutans was also present in samples showing dissolution (12/34). There was no relationship between dissolution and the numbers of S. mutans; however, the isolation frequency of S. mutans was associated with dissolution (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Evaluation of antimicrobial activity in vitro of ten root canal sealers on Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of ten root canal sealers was studied on Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mutans. One hundred plates of trypticase soy agar-sheep red blood cell (10%), each with four distinct 3 mm diameter wells, were divided into two groups of 50 by means of the Lawn technique; one group was inoculated with S. sanguis and the other with S. mutans. Four milligrams of each root canal sealer was placed in each of three wells in 10 plates (five plates of each inoculant); the fourth well was left empty as a control site. Plates were incubated at 37 degrees C and checked after 2, 7, and 14 days. All root canal sealers inhibited growth of both organisms. The inhibitory zones for S. sanguis were larger than inhibitory zones for S. mutans for all tested sealers, except Diaket. Dentinol, Kerr, and Tubliseal had significantly more inhibitory effect on S. sanguis than did other tested sealers (p less than 0.05). Diaket had superior inhibition on S. mutans.
TI  - [The immunological basis of vaccination against carious disease. Microorganism interactions. Specific host defense system. Immunological protection of the oral cavity].
AB  - The authors describe the very complex interactions of the microorganisms of the oral cavity and among these latter and the guest organism. There are described the mechanisms of aspecific defense of the oral cavity and give some outlines of the anatomy and of the physiology of the organs and of the glandular structures of the specific immune defence of the oral cavity through blood and saliva.
TI  - An in vitro study of the antibacterial and antifungal properties of an irreversible hydrocolloid impression material impregnated with disinfectant.
AB  - The difficulties associated with the disinfection of alginate (irreversible hydrocolloid) materials have resulted in the development of an irreversible hydrocolloid impression material impregnated with an antimicrobial compound, didecyldimethyl ammonium chloride. This investigation assessed the antibacterial and antifungal properties in vitro of this innovative irreversible hydrocolloid material by using the agar well technique. The microorganisms used were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Lactobacillus odontolyticus rodriguez, Actinomyces odontolyticus, mixed salivary organisms, and Candida albicans. The results showed an absence of activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Varying degrees of antibacterial activity were exhibited against the other microorganisms. It is concluded that it is not know whether the limited antibacterial and antifungal effect demonstrated in this study is sufficient to prevent bacterial and fungal colonization of the impression surface in the mouth during clinical practice.
TI  - Characterization of salivary alpha-amylase binding to Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to identify the major salivary components which interact with oral bacteria and to determine the mechanism(s) responsible for their binding to the bacterial surface. Strains of Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, and Actinomyces viscosus were incubated for 2 h in freshly collected human submandibular-sublingual saliva (HSMSL) or parotid saliva (HPS), and bound salivary components were eluted with 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate. By sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western transfer, alpha-amylase (EC 3.2.1.1) was the prominent salivary component eluted from S. sanguis. Studies with 125I-labeled HSMSL or 125I-labeled HPS also demonstrated a component with an electrophoretic mobility identical to that of alpha-amylase which bound to S. sanguis. Purified alpha-amylase from human parotid saliva was radiolabeled and found to bind to strains of S. sanguis genotypes 1 and 3 and S. mitis genotype 2, but not to strains of other species of oral bacteria. Binding of [125I]alpha-amylase to streptococci was saturable, calcium independent, and inhibitable by excess unlabeled alpha-amylases from a variety of sources, but not by secretory immunoglobulin A and the proline-rich glycoprotein from HPS. Reduced and alkylated alpha-amylase lost enzymatic and bacterial binding activities. Binding was inhibited by incubation with maltotriose, maltooligosaccharides, limit dextrins, and starch.
TI  - [Lysis of oral streptococci by an extracellular enzyme from the bacterium Streptococcus mutans].
AB  - The ability of crude extracellular enzyme produced by the bacterium Streptococcus mutans AL-7 to lysis the cells of five species, sixteen strains, of oral streptococci was examined. This enzyme showed lytic activity of living cells of only Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10558 strain, and of heated cells of Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10558 and ST-7 strains. The long chains of Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10558 was severed at random by this enzyme. Early log phase cells of this strain were more sensitive to this enzyme than late log phase cells. No bacteriocins or bacteriocin-like substances were produced by Streptococcus mutans AL-7 strain in chemically defined medium. In view of these results, the relationship between this lytic enzyme from Streptococcus mutans and a decrease in the number of serotype III strains of Streptococcus sanguis in dental plaque is suggested.
TI  - [Glucosyltransferase (GTF) and immunization against dental caries in humans].
AB  - Glucosyltransferase (GTF) is an extracellular or cell-associated enzyme synthesized by the "mutans" group of streptococci as well as the S. sanguis and is responsible for the biosynthesis of extracellular polysaccharides. Glucan formation in dental plaque mediates binding of S. mutans and S. sanguis to one another as well as to other bacteria. Although the production of organic acids is an indispensable property of the cariogenic strains of bacteria, their ability to stick and accumulate on tooth surfaces is an almost equally significant parameter of virulence. Furthermore, GTF has been proven to be an effective antigen in eliciting caries-protective secretory IgA antibodies in rodent models. That led to the identification of GTF as a potential antigen for use in a human caries vaccine. The results of recent studies suggest that oral immunization with GTF, has the potential to elicit a secretory IgA antibody response and to interfere with accumulation and permanent colonization of S. mutans on smooth tooth surfaces. However, it cannot be inferred from the available data whether such a vaccine is effective in caries prevention in human beings. Although many modifications seem to be necessary with regard to the composition, dose, frequency and route of administration of the antigen, the preparation of a safe and effective vaccine against human caries is considered to be feasible in the near future.
TI  - Classification and identification of the viridans streptococci.
AB  - This review traces the history of the human, nonhemolytic, or viridans, streptococci and describes improvements in their taxonomy wrought by study of their biochemical profiles and analysis of their nucleic acids. The goal was to define species on the basis of genetic relationships and to describe these species by their phenotypic characteristics so that they can be easily identified. This method has resulted in the division of some species. Streptococcus mutans has been divided into four species, two of which are common in humans. Three more mutans group species are indigenous to animals. Conversely, S. constellatus, S. intermedius, and "S. milleri" have been combined under S. anginosus. S. mitis (or "S. mitior") can be well-defined and includes S. sanguis II. There is genetic heterogeneity within S. sanguis, but the species is usually easy to identify. There is also some heterogeneity in S. bovis, but most human isolates are genetically related. Discussions of the taxonomy of these species are accompanied by descriptions of the characteristics by which these streptococci can be identified. Among these species are potential pathogens which should be suspected in cases of endocarditis and purulent infections of liver, brain, and other tissues.
TI  - Technical note: antimicrobial action of glass-ionomer lining cement on S. sanguis and S. mutans.
AB  - There are a number of glass-ionomer lining cements available to the profession. It is generally agreed that the glass-ionomer cements demonstrate reasonably good biocompatibility. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of six glass-ionomer cements on S. sanguis and S. mutans. Forty-eight plates of TSA-SRBC (10%), each with 3.0-mm-diam. wells, were divided into two groups (1 and 2) of 24 each. Group 1 was inoculated with S. sanguis (10558) and Group 2 with S. mutans (6715-13 w.t.). Each well was filled with 4.0 mg of one of the following liners: Glassic (A), Shofu lining cement (B), GC lining cement (C), Ever Bond (D), Gingiva Seal (E), and Ketac Bond (F); the empty wells served as control. Plates were incubated under microaerophilic conditions at 37 degrees C, and checked daily over seven days for inhibition zones. Average inhibition zones (mm) at 7 days were as follows: Group 1-1A = 10.00, 1B = 7.83, 1C = 18.50, 1D = 13.00, 1E = 8.67, and 1F = 9.33; Group 2-2A = 3.08, 2B = 10.25, 2C = 12.75, 2D = 15.58, 2E = 8.83, and 2F = 3.20. All control wells were 0.0 GC liner and Ever Bond showed significantly greater overall inhibition of microbial growth than did other tested liners (p less than 0.5). A one-way ANOVA and SNK test showed that all tested liners were significantly more toxic toward S. sanguis than toward S. mutans (p less than 0.05).
TI  - Isolation and characterization of the Streptococcus mutans gtfD gene, coding for  primer-dependent soluble glucan synthesis.
AB  - Two glucosyltransferase genes from Streptococcus mutans GS-5, gtfB and gtfC, have been previously isolated and sequenced in this laboratory. In the present communication a third gtf gene, gtfD, was isolated and characterized. Isolation of the gene involved a novel procedure utilizing the integration plasmid pVA891. A peptide expressed by the 1.7-kilobase DNA fragment from strain NHS1 (containing deletions in both the gtfB and gtfC genes) was initially identified in a pUC18 clone bank with antiglucosyltransferase antibodies. This fragment was integrated into the GS-5 chromosome following ligation into pVA891 and transformation, yielding strain DP2. The vector together with one complete and one incomplete copy of the gtfD gene was removed from the chromosome of strain DP2 following EcoRI digestion, religation, and transformation of E. coli HB101. The resultant plasmid, pNH4, expressed glucosyltransferase S (GTF-S) activity. The enzyme was purified to near homogeneity and was shown to synthesize water-soluble glucan exclusively in a primer-dependent manner. The molecular mass (155 kilodaltons) and the kinetic parameters of the purified enzyme were similar to those observed for the GTF-S enzyme previously purified from culture fluids of strain GS-5. Insertional inactivation of the gtfD gene indicated that this gene is not required for in vitro sucrose-dependent adherence to smooth surfaces. Furthermore, inactivation of the gtfD gene in a gtfC gtfB mutant indicated that three distinct gtf genes involved in glucan formation are present on the S. mutans GS-5 chromosome. Southern blot analysis further suggested that the gtfD gene does not share demonstrable homology with the gtf genes from Streptococcus sanguis or Streptococcus sobrinus.
TI  - Molecular surface characterization of oral streptococci by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.
AB  - In order to characterize the molecular composition of oral streptococci, infrared transmission spectroscopy on freeze-dried cells dissolved in KBr was used. All infrared spectra show similar absorption bands for the strains studied with the most important absorption bands located at 2930 cm-1 (CH), 1653 cm-1 (AmI), 1541 cm-1 (AmII) and two bands at 1236 cm-1 and 1082 cm-1, which were assigned to phosphate and sugar groups. However, calculation of absorption band ratios normalized with respect to the integrated intensity of the CH stretching region around 2930 cm-1, show significant differences between the strains. Both Streptococcus mitis strains possess high AmI/CH and AmII/CH absorption band ratios compared to the other strains. Streptococcus salivarius HBC12, a mutant strain devoid of all proteinaceous surface appendages, shows significantly lower AmI/CH and AmII/CH band ratios with respect to its parent strain S. salivarius HB. Two positive relationships could be established both between the AmII/CH absorption band ratio and the N/C elemental surface concentration ratio of the strains previously, determined from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and also between AmI/CH and the fraction of carbon atoms at the surface involved in amide bonds, determined by XPS as well. From this comparison, it is concluded that transmission infrared spectroscopy can be employed as a technique to study the molecular surface composition of freeze-dried microorganisms.
TI  - Microflora in plaque from approximal posterior composite resin restorations.
AB  
TI  - Identification of viridans streptococci by pyrolysis-gas chromatography.
AB  - An isothermal method of pyrolysis-gas chromatography (Py-GC) was used for the identification of viridans streptococci. Pyrograms from 104 reference strains were subjected to a discriminant analysis to produce classification coefficients for the identification of 74 test organisms. Five groups representing recognised species were discriminated but Streptococcus milleri strains could not be distinguished from S. sanguis. If S. milleri and S. sanguis are regarded as a single pyrogroup, only three strains out of 74 were incorrectly identified by Py-GC. A multidimensional scaling analysis of the Py-GC data produced a similar species grouping, but this statistical method was less satisfactory for pyrogram data than discriminant analysis. While Py-GC was moderately successful for the identification of viridans streptococci, this study indicated that the technique has limited use in diagnostic medical microbiology because it is time-consuming and lacks flexibility.
TI  - Determination of viridans streptococci surface lipoteichoic acid by enzyme linked immune sorbent assay.
AB  - An enzyme linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA) was developed to measure bacterial  surface lipoteichoic acid (LTA). Numerous strains of oral streptococci belonging to the 'viridans' group were examined on three separate occasions. The results show that, under these cultural conditions, oral streptococci do not normally express LTA on the cell surface. Occasionally strains produced amounts of LTA detectable using the ELISA but this was not a reproducible phenomenon.
TI  - A physiological classification of viridans streptococci by use of the API-20STREP system.
AB  - Physiological reactions of viridans streptococci were examined by the API-20STREP system and a selection of conventional tests. Cluster analysis of these results produced a classification similar to a taxonomic scheme based on that of Colman and Williams. The organisms could be divided into the six recognised species--Streptococcus mutans, S. bovis, S. mitior, S. sanguis, S. salivarius and S. milleri. Analysis confirmed that S. mitior and S. sanguis can be distinguished in the API-20STREP test by hydrolysis of arginine but not by dextran production. Although S. mutans, S. mitior and S. sanguis can be divided into two further subgroups, the taxonomic significance of this is unclear. With this means of classification, most organisms could be identified easily by a small number of tests. API-20STREP is convenient for performing physiological tests on viridans streptococci, but the information provided by the manufacturers in regard to identification and nomenclature is in need of revision.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide liners on Streptococcus sanguis and S. mutans.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of 10 calcium hydroxide liners on Streptococcus sanguis and S. mutans was studied. One hundred plates of tryticose soy agar-sheep red blood cells (10%), each with four distinct 3 mm diameter wells, were divided into two groups of 50. One group was inoculated with S. sanguis and the second group with S. mutans. A 4 mg liner was placed in each of three wells; the fourth well was left empty as a control. Plates were incubated at 37 degrees C and observed at 24 hours, 48 hours, and 7 days. All liners inhibited growth of both organisms. The inhibitory zones for S. mutans were larger than inhibitory zones for S. sanguis for all tested liners. Life Fast Set material had significantly less inhibitory effect on S. mutans. VLC Dycal, Life, and Life Fast Set materials had significantly less inhibitory effect on S. sanguis at p = 0.05.
TI  - The effects of pellicle formation on streptococcal adhesion to human enamel and artificial substrata with various surface free-energies.
AB  - The influence of a pellicle on streptococcal adhesion was studied. A "ripened" two-hour salivary pellicle and an "early" five-minute salivary pellicle were formed on human enamel and artificial solid substrata with varying surface free-energies. Three strains of oral streptococci, also with widely different surface free-energies, were used for adhesion studies. Pellicle formation and streptococcal adhesion took place at a constant shear rate of 21 s-1. Adhesion of S. mitis BMS to bare and pellicle-covered enamel was low and not significantly affected by the presence of a pellicle (0.7 x 10(6) and 0.6 x 10(6) cells.cm-2, resp.), whereas the numbers of S. sanguis 12 and S. mutans NS adhering to bare enamel (4.2 x 10(6) cells.cm-2 and 13.8 x 10(6) cells, cm-2, resp) were significantly reduced by the presence of a pellicle. This reduction was almost complete after only five minutes of salivary protein adsorption (1.9 x 10(-6) and 1.1 x 10(6) cells.cm-2 for S. sanguis and S. mutans, resp.) but further reduced for S. sanguis adhering to a ripened pellicle (0.7 x 10(6) cells.cm-2). The numbers of streptococci adhering at equilibrium to bare enamel could be fitted to a thermodynamically based model, which was previously described for bacterial adhesion to homogenous artificial substrata. Streptococcal adhesion to artificial substrata exposed to saliva was low, and the differences among uncoated materials were markedly reduced even after only five minutes' exposure to saliva.
TI  - Cariogenicity of a lactate dehydrogenase-deficient mutant of Streptococcus mutans serotype c in gnotobiotic rats.
AB  - A lactate dehydrogenase-deficient (Ldh-) mutant of a human isolate of Streptococcus mutans serotype c was tested in a gnotobiotic rat caries model. Compared with the wild-type Ldh-positive (Ldh+) strains, it was significantly (alpha less than or equal to 0.005) less cariogenic in experiments with two different sublines of Sprague-Dawley rats. The Ldh- mutant strain 044 colonized the oral cavity of the test animals to the same extent as its parent strain 041, although its initial implantation was slightly but not significantly (P greater than or equal to 0.2) less. Multiple oral or fecal samples plated on 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium indicator medium revealed no evidence of back mutation from Ldh- to Ldh+ in vivo. Both Ldh+ strain 041 and Ldh- strain 044 demonstrated bacteriocinlike activity in vitro against a number of human strains of mutans streptococci representing serotype a (S. cricetus) and serotypes c and e (S. mutans). Serotypes b (S. rattus) and f (S. mutans) and strains of S. mitior, S. sanguis, and S. salivarius were not inhibited. Thus, Ldh mutant strain 044 possesses a number of desirable traits that suggest it should be investigated further as a possible effector strain for replacement therapy of dental caries. These traits include its stability and low cariogenicity in the sensitive gnotobiotic rat caries model, its bacteriocinlike activity against certain other cariogenic S. mutans (but not against more inocuous indigenous oral streptococci), and the fact that it is a member of the most prevalent human serotype of cariogenic streptococci.
TI  - Aggregation of 27 oral bacteria by human whole saliva. Influence of culture medium, calcium, and bacterial cell concentration, and interference by autoaggregation.
AB  - Twenty-seven oral strains of the genera Actinomyces (5), Bacteroides (3), and Streptococcus (19) were tested for aggregation by human whole saliva, as well as the effect of culture medium, Ca-ions, and bacteria concentration thereupon. Of the media tested, GF-broth gave rise to less interference by autoaggregation or higher aggregation titers than BHI and TSB, and was used throughout this study. In most cases, Ca-ions (1 mM) only enhanced the rate of induced aggregation, whereas raising the bacteria concentration increased the rate of both induced- and autoaggregation. The final titers, ranging from 1-64, were hardly affected by these parameters, except those of S. rattus HG 59 and S. mutans HG 199, which were respectively increased and decreased by Ca-ions. Saliva-induced aggregation was observed for 21 strains of A. viscosus, A. naeslundii, A. israelii, B. gingivalis, B. intermedius, S. cricetus, S. mutans, S. rattus, S. sanguis, and S. sobrinus, mostly within 15 min to 3 h. Seventeen of these strains also showed autoaggregation, usually well after the onset of induced aggregation. Any potential induced aggregation of B. gingivalis HG 91 was always masked by autoaggregation, as well as that of the S. mutans strains under a particular set of conditions. The aggregation rate and titer varied considerably in a mutually unrelated and strain-dependent way. These microtiterplate data were matched by the 5 spectrophotometric patterns observed for saliva-bacterial interaction, which moreover, gave the better differentiation between induced and autoaggregation. In conclusion, most strains tested can show rapid saliva-induced aggregation in a strain-dependent way, yet strongly affected by the experimental conditions and interference from autoaggregation.
TI  - Production of mutacin-like substances by Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Production of inhibitory substances by strains of the Streptococcus mutans group  is well documented, but the nature of the substances implied is often unknown. Of nine laboratory strains known to produce inhibitory substances, the optimal conditions for producing inhibition zones on solid media were found to vary between strains but good production was generally obtained on all-purpose media with Tween 80 at 37 degrees C after 2-4 days of aerobic incubation. Streptococcus sanguis Ny101 was found to be more sensitive than Streptococcus rattus LG-1 to all inhibitory substances produced by the S. mutans strains tested. While all strains showed some inhibition, only six showed inhibition after neutralization; arginine incorporated in agar at 0.75% completely eliminated all inhibition zones. However 1% arginine in the overlays did not affect the production of inhibition zones by strains of S. mutans C67-1, Ny257, Ny266, and T8. These strains were shown to elaborate (in a reproducible fashion) inhibitory substances which were not organic acids. Inhibitory activity was never obtained in liquid preparations, except for strains Ny257 and T8 where it was found to be very unstable.
TI  - [In vitro study of bacterial invasion in radicular dentin].
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate whether plaque bacteria invade exposed radicular dentin after root planing or chemical root treatment in vitro. Pieces of dentin were cut out from impacted third molars. The surface of all dentin pieces was treated with sandpaper (#240) so as to make the surface roughness of dentin pieces equal to that of the root surface after root planing (RP surface). Half of the dentin pieces were treated with citric acid (pH 1.0) for 3 minutes (CA surface). After sterilization, each dentin piece was incubated at 37 degrees C in a culture medium inoculated with either S. mutans or S. sanguis. After 1, 3, 7 and 28 days of incubation, the invasion of microorganisms into the dentinal tubules was histologically examined using a light microscope. The following results were obtained. 1. The invasion of S. mutans and S. sanguis into the dentinal tubules was observed at 1, 3, 7 and 28 days. The depth and number of bacterial invasion into the dentinal tubules were positively correlated with incubation time on CA surfaces but not with RP surfaces. 2. The depth and the number of bacterial invasion into the dentinal tubules were higher on the CA surfaces than the RP surfaces. 3. Since the citric acid treatment of scaled and root planed root surfaces may accelerate bacterial invasion from treated root surfaces, the use of citric acid might be harmful in patients with inadequate plaque control.
TI  - Effects of sustained-release chlorhexidine acetate on the human dental plaque flora.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the effect on the human dental plaque flora of a varnish containing chlorhexidine diacetate. The in vitro release of chlorhexidine acetate from the varnish preparation was relatively fast on the first day, followed by a substantial decline in the subsequent three days. In a clinical experiment, 26 volunteers were randomly distributed over four experimental groups. After a dental prophylaxis, the subjects were treated with a single application of a placebo varnish (group I), a fluoride varnish (group II), a chlorhexidine varnish (group III), or a fluoride-plus-chlorhexidine varnish (group IV). Saliva and pooled plaque samples from approximal surfaces were taken before (baseline) and one, two, three, four, and six weeks after the treatments. No suppression was found of total cultivable flora or S. sanguis after the experimental treatments. Application of the fluoride varnish did not suppress the A. viscosus/naeslundii or S. mutans levels in the dental plaque. Chlorhexidine suppressed A. viscosus/naeslundii until two weeks after the treatment. S. mutans was significantly suppressed until four weeks after a single chlorhexidine application. While in some subjects S. mutans was effectively suppressed over the whole experimental period, in others S. mutans recovered quickly. In five subjects in whom S. mutans recovered quickly, the dentition was treated twice with chlorhexidine varnish, with an interval of one week between the treatments. After two chlorhexidine treatments, S. mutans in saliva and on the teeth was suppressed more strongly than after a single treatment. However, the second chlorhexidine treatment could not prevent the return of S. mutans in the approximal areas to its original level.
TI  - DNA probe for identification of Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - A total of 287 clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) were  tested for their ability to undergo autolysis when treated with sodium deoxycholate. The test was positive for all but one isolate, strain DOC-1. This autolysis required the activity of an enzyme which is unique and characteristic of S. pneumoniae: a choline-dependent N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase, the gene product of the lytA gene. We used lytA as a DNA probe to test the distribution of the autolysin gene among clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae. In dot blot hybridization experiments our probe reacted with the DNA of 60 of 60 strains tested, including the autolysis-deficient clinical isolate DOC-1. No hybridization occurred when strains of Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis, Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecium, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus bovis were tested. The lytA gene appears to be an ideal candidate for use as a DNA probe for the identification of S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Acidogenesis by oral streptococci at different pH values.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans is known to be one of the most cariogenic oral microorganisms. Recently, organisms classified as S. mutans have been shown to be genotypically heterogeneous and to form at least six separate species. In this study, differences in acid production between the mutans streptococci and Streptococcus sanguis were investigated at pH values from 5.0 to 7.0. While all of the species investigated were able to produce acids, Streptococcus sobrinus was found to be significantly more acidogenic than the others. S. sobrinus was capable of sustained acid production at pH levels below 6.0, while acid production by other species ceased or was strongly inhibited. These results indicate that S. sobrinus deserves more attention as a potentially cariogenic microorganism.
TI  - [Microbiologic in vitro comparison of plaque-inhibiting mouthwashes].
AB  - The colonization on rat molars of S. sobrinus OMZ 176, S. mutans OMZ 376, or a combination S. sanguis OMZ 9 and S. sobrinus OMZ 176 after a short exposition to various fluoride solutions and disinfectants was tested in vitro. The test solutions included Act, Candida, Veadent, sodium fluoride, amine fluoride, stannous fluoride, zinc fluoride hexetidine, stannous fluoride/amine fluoride solutions, chlorhexidine and water. The sterilized rat molars were immersed in the above test solutions for 60 seconds, then incubated with streptococci in broth for 8 hours, again dipped into the same test solutions for 60 seconds and reincubated for an additional 30 hours. The streptococcal suspension contained 14C labelled sucrose solutions. The deposits on the molars were dissolved in 6N potassium hydroxide during 16 hours. Finally, the beta rays emitted by the dissolved radiolabelled suspension were counted using a scintillation counter. The sodium fluoride containing solutions exerted no or a very limited effect on the bacterial deposits. In contrast to the other test solutions, sanguinaria extract (Veadent mouth rinse) mildly inhibited the S. sobrinus and S. mutans deposits, but plaque formation by the combination of streptococci was not hampered. Zinc fluoride/hexetidine, amine fluoride and stannous fluoride/amine fluoride solutions had a distinct and significant inhibitory effect on S. sobrinus and S. mutans deposits, but only a weak effect when mixed cultures were used for plaque formation. Chlorhexidine significantly inhibited the deposits of the three bacterial strains used in these experiments.
TI  - Difference in amounts between titratable acid and total carboxylic acids produced by oral streptococci during sugar metabolism.
AB  - The acid produced by the resting cells of Streptococcus mutants NCTC 10449 and HS 6 and S. sanguis ATCC 10556 during sugar metabolism was estimated with a pH-stat and a carboxylic acid analyzer. Lactic, formic, acetic, pyruvic, and carbonic acids were detected in the reaction mixtures, but propionic, citric, succinic, iso-butyric, butyric, iso-valeric, and valeric acids were not detected. The amount of titratable acid estimated by alkaline titration with the pH-stat was larger than the amount of total carboxylic acids estimated with the carboxylic acid analyzer. The difference in quantity between the titratable and the total carboxylic acids increased significantly with an increase in the period of incubation with sugar. Moreover, the value of the alkaline titration of standard lactic, formic, acetic, and pyruvic acids was equal to the amount analyzed with the carboxylic acid analyzer. The results indicated that these two streptococci produced not only these carboxylic acids but also other acid(s), possibly non-carboxylic acid(s), during their sugar metabolism.
TI  - Water-soluble glucans from Streptococcus mutans strain Ing-Britt as an energy source for bacterial growth.
AB  - Two fractions of water-soluble glucans with different molecular weight were produced by Streptococcus mutans IB. The larger glucan had a molecular weight of about 40,000. The molecular weight of the small glucan was estimated to be 4,100 by gel filtration chromatography and by biochemical methods. These glucans were tested for their ability to initiate and support growth of S. mutans IB and Streptococcus sanguis 903. S. sanguis 903 could grow with the low molecular weight glucan at a reduced rate compared with glucose. S. mutans IB could not utilize any of the glucans. No endo- or exo-glucanase activities could be detected in culture supernatants of any of the strains. In addition to maltose S. sanguis 903 could also utilize maltotriose, maltopentaose and maltoheptaose for growth while S. mutans IB could not grow with maltopentaose or maltoheptaose.
TI  - Lactate influx and efflux in the 'Streptococcus mutants group' and Streptococcus  sanguis.
AB  - Lactate influx was measured in Streptococcus sanguis and in several strains of Streptococcus mutans by comparing the intra- and extracellular distribution of (14C)-lactate. Lactate efflux was followed enzymatically against rising external lactate concentration. The glucose concentration was monitored in the same way. With S. sanguis OMZ 9, lactate was transported into the cells when a high external lactate concentration and a pH gradient were established. The transport rate was approximately 1,000 nmol lactate per minute and milligram protein. No lactate influx could be measured with four strains of the 'S. mutans group' (OMZ 51, 634, T3/13 and NCTC 10449). Metabolizing cells of S. mutans NCTC 10449 were able to transport lactate even against an external lactate concentration of 92 mmol/l at pH = 7. The transport rates ranged from 1,200 to 750 nmol lactate/min mg protein decreasing with increasing external lactate concentration. While an external pH = 9 had little influence on transport, transport rates decreased to 440 nmol/min mg protein at pH = 5.
TI  - Zeta potential and the adhesion of oral streptococci to polymethylmethacrylate.
AB  - Adhesion of Candida albicans to the acrylic fitting surface of dentures can lead  to the development of denture induced stomatitis and is suggested to be preceeded by the adhesion of indegeneous oral bacteria. Bacterial adhesion can be considered as a result of attractive van der Waals and repulsive electrostatic forces. In this paper we investigate the role of electrostatic interactions in the adhesion of oral streptococci to polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), the most commonly employed denture-base material. Zeta potentials of the bacterial strains as well as of PMMA fillings were reduced by increasing the ionic strength in the buffer suspension, causing an elevated number of adhering S. mitis, S. sanguis and S. mutans. As streptococcal adhesion is suggested to be a prerequisite for the subsequent adhesion of Candida albicans, the use of more negatively charged denture-base materials can be recommended in order to prevent streptococcal adhesion and therewith adhesion of candidae, and the occurrence of denture-induced stomatitis.
TI  - Comparison of different assays for the aggregation of oral bacteria by human whole saliva.
AB  - For comparison, human whole saliva-induced aggregation was studied by phase-contrast microscopy, spectrophotometry combined with macroscopic observations, and in microtiterplate assay under identical experimental conditions for Actinomyces viscosus HG 85 (T14-V) and HG 380 (T14-AV), Bacteroides gingivalis HG 66 (W 83), Streptococcus rattus HG 59 (BHT), and Streptococcus sanguis I HG 169. The entire process of formation, extension, and sedimentation of aggregates could merely be observed by the combination of these assays. The very first stages of aggregation could only be detected and quantitated by phase-contrast microscopy. Within 2 1/2 min, 50% of the A. viscosus, S. rattus, and S. sanguis cells were aggregated, denoted as T50. In microtiterplates, however, aggregates were observed in general only after sedimentation at 30-45 min of incubation, expressed as TA. For interpretation of the spectrophotometric curves, additional microscopic and macroscopic data were a prerequisite. The small decline in absorbance during the first 30-45 min (phase 1) corresponded to the formation and extension of nonsedimenting aggregates, whereas the subsequent pronounced fall in absorbance (phase 2) was caused by the massive sedimentation of aggregates. The moment of inflexion between both phases, TI, marked the onset of sedimentation of aggregates and corresponded very well with TA, at which time already 92-98% of the cells were aggregated as quantitated by microscopy. In conclusion, only by microscopy the formation and extension of aggregates could be observed within a few minutes and quantitated in terms of aggregation rate. From 30-45 min, merely the sedimentation of aggregates was visualized in microtiterplates, whereas the time course of the overall process was recorded indirectly by spectrophotometry.
TI  - A comparison between the elemental surface compositions and electrokinetic properties of oral streptococci with and without adsorbed salivary constituents.
AB  - In order to characterize the functional cell surface, isoelectric points and elemental surface concentration, the ratios of nitrogen, oxygen and phosphorus to carbon of saliva-coated strains were determined by pH-dependent zeta potential measurements and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and compared with those of uncoated strains. The measurements of potential were carried out on completely hydrated cells, whereas the spectroscopy was on freeze-dried micro-organisms. The small increase in the nitrogen:carbon surface concentration ratio of saliva-coated streptococci in comparison to uncoated strains varied from 0.001 (Streptococcus mitis BA) to 0.029 (Streptococcus sanguis CH3) and was concurrent with an increase of the isoelectric point, ranging from 0.0 to 0.9. Increases in the oxygen:carbon ratio ranged from 0.006 (Strep. mitis BA) to 0.041 (Streptococcus mutans NS), whereas the phosphorus:carbon surface concentration ratio was unchanged after saliva treatment. Despite the fact that isoelectric and compositional measurements were made in different states of surface hydration, a decrease in the nitrogen:carbon ratio accompanied by an increase in oxygen:carbon ratio, was related to a decrease of the isoelectric point of the saliva-coated strains, and so analogous with previous observations for uncoated strains. Although there were changes in the physico-chemical properties of the strains upon saliva coating, all more or less kept their own surface identity despite adsorption of salivary constituents, possibly indicating some capacity to protect their own physico-chemical identity.

TI  - Effect of zeta potential and surface energy on bacterial adhesion to uncoated and saliva-coated human enamel and dentin.
AB  - Physicochemical surface characteristics of early plaque-forming bacteria and of human tooth surfaces were measured to establish their role in bacterial adhesion to intact dental tissue slabs. In addition, the influence of an experimental salivary pellicle was evaluated. Strains of S. mutans, S. sanguis, S. salivarius, A. viscosus, and A. odontolyticus showed relatively high surface free energies (range, 99-128 mJ.m-2) and carried a negative surface charge, at both physiological (mu = 0.057) and low (mu = 0.020) ionic strengths of the medium. Very large differences in hydrophobicity were detected when the hexadecane adsorption test was used for measurement. Powdered enamel and dentin were also negatively charged at low ionic strength but were slightly positively charged in the physiological buffer. The surface free energy of enamel and dentin increased upon saliva coating, whereas the surface charge was always negative. The adhesion experiments showed: (1) large differences in the binding of various bacteria to the same surface; (2) an up to 20-fold difference in the binding of the same bacterium to different surfaces, although the binding of some strains was relatively independent of the type of surface or presence of a salivary pellicle; (3) a significant decrease in adhesion when the ionic strength of the medium was lowered, due to increased electrostatic repulsion (however, the adhesion of some bacteria was independent of the ionic strength of the medium); (4) different time-dependent adherence kinetics, depending on both the bacteria and nature of the solid surface; and (5) a propensity for plaque streptococci to bind to uncoated dentin.
TI  - Utilization of a continuous streptococcal surface to measure interbacterial adherence in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - Cell-to-cell interactions are essential for the formation of dental plaque. A continuous layer of Streptococcus sanguis SA-1 cells fixed to a solid surface has been used to evaluate interactions among this bacterium, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, and Streptococcus sobrinus. S. sanguis cells were attached to a Falcon 3001 tissue culture plates or bovine enamel chips, coated with a biological adhesive. Scanning electron microscopy of the chips showed the streptococci as a contiguous surface. Radiolabeled bacteria were used to measure a second-species interbacterial adherence to the streptococcal-coated culture plates. Strains of H. parainfluenzae known to coaggregate (strain HP-28) and not to coaggregate (strains HP-42 and HP-80), in suspension with S. sanguis strain SA-1, were studied for adherence. Ten-fold-higher numbers of coaggregating strain HP-28 adhered in vitro to the streptococcal layer than did the non-coaggregating strains. S. sobrinus strain 6715 did not show appreciable adherence to the S. sanguis surface. Saliva did not affect the adherence of coaggregating or non-coaggregating H. parainfluenzae strains to S. sanguis strain SA-1. Bovine enamel chips, coated with streptococci, mounted on modified orthodontic appliances and placed in the mouths of three volunteers, facilitated the measurement of interbacterial adherence in vivo of streptomycin-resistant strains of H. parainfluenzae (HP-28R or HP-42R). Suspensions of bacteria were placed into the mouth, distributed throughout, and expectorated. After 15 or 120 minutes, the appliance with the chips was removed, the chips sonified, and colony-forming units (CFU) of streptomycin-resistant haemophili determined per chip.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Specific and nonspecific inhibition of adhesion of oral actinomyces and streptococci to erythrocytes and polystyrene by caseinoglycopeptide derivatives.
AB  - Various caseinoglycopeptide derivatives prepared from mammalian milk were evaluated as inhibitors of hemagglutinations mediated by Actinomyces viscosus Ny1, Streptococcus sanguis OMZ9, and, for comparative purposes, plant lectins from Arachis hypogaea and Bauhinia purpurea. It was found that recognition of the beta-D-galactose-(1----3)-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-galactose carbohydrate chain by Actinomyces viscosus Ny1 organisms and Arachis hypogaea and B. purpurea agglutinins had similar structural requirements; in all cases, the desialylated bovine caseinoglycomacropeptide, on which several units of the above mentioned disaccharide are clustered, behaved as the most potent hemagglutination inhibitor. By contrast, none of the preparations tested inhibited erythrocyte agglutination by S. sanguis OMZ9. Thus, the desialylated bovine caseinoglycomacropeptide acts as a potent and specific inhibitor of oral Actinomyces adhesion to cell membranes (a soft surface) and could be used as a probe for the study of recognition mechanisms mediated by Actinomyces galactose-binding lectins. During the present study, both native and desialylated variants of the same bovine glycomacropeptide also totally prevented the adhesion of Actinomyces viscosus Ny1, S. sanguis OMZ9, and S. mutans OMZ176 to polystyrene surfaces. Comparative evaluations of various structurally different compounds gave the following results. Neither mono- nor disaccharides related to caseinoglycopeptide carbohydrates prevented adhesion; highly positively or negatively charged polypeptides and polysaccharides were either not or only moderately active. Besides these glycomacropeptides, an inhibitory activity was also exhibited by other mucin-type glycoproteins carrying short O-linked carbohydrate chains (including bovine submaxillary mucin), polyethylene glycol, and bovine serum albumin. Consequently, caseinoglycopeptide prevention of oral bacterial adhesion to polystyrene tubes (a hard surface) takes place with no species specificity and can be compared to nonspecific inhibition exhibited by various polymers with very different structural characteristics.

TI  - Antibiotic resistance and production of inhibitory substances among bacterial strains isolated from the oral cavities of BALB/c mice.
AB  - In the oral cavities of BALB/c mice, microbial population levels are regulated by multifactorial processes. Factors include the production of inhibitory substances and the exchange of genetic material. In this work, 371 isolates from different sites (saliva, tongue, teeth, and mucosa) of the oral cavities of BALB/c mice were screened for resistance to antibiotics and antimicrobial activity. Antibiotic-resistant strains represented 25% of the total flora. Among the predominant species, all the S. faecalis isolates showed multiresistance, and 23% of the Lactobacillus murinus isolates and 15% of the Staphylococcus aureus were resistant to at least one antibiotic. Resistance to aminoglycosides (neomycin, streptomycin, kanamycin, and gentamicin) was most frequently encountered. In S. faecalis, high levels of resistance were recorded to neomycin and streptomycin but not to gentamicin or kanamycin. Macrolides (M), lincosamides (L), streptogramin B (S), tetracycline (Tc), and chloramphenicol (Cm) resistance was also present in multiresistance patterns, especially among S. faecalis isolates. Hemolytic (Hly+) streptococci were less resistant to MLS, Tc, and Cm than were non-hemolytic (Hly-) isolates. Resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics was detected only among staphylococci and with a low prevalence (4%). The frequencies of strains producing antimicrobial substances against the indicator strains (S. mutans LG-1, S. sanguis Ny 101, and A. viscosus Ny 1) were high for L. murinus (76%) and S. faecalis (57% for Hly- and 90% for Hly+), but low for S. aureus (7%). These results indicate that the indigenous oral flora could interfere with colonization by allochthonous micro-organisms and that resistance patterns should be taken into account for the elimination of the oral indigenous flora by antibiotic treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Inhibition of adhesion of viridans streptococci to fibronectin-coated hydroxyapatite beads by lipoteichoic acid.
AB  - Fibronectin-coated hydroxyapatite (FnHA) beads were used in a model adhesion assay to isolate the lipoteichoic acid (LTA) mediated adhesion of oral streptococci. Representative strains of the commonly isolated viridans streptococci were incubated with FnHA beads in the presence and absence of exogenous LTA. The LTA inhibited the adhesion of all strains to a greater or lesser extent, but only a very few strains were inhibited by more than 90%. Strains of Streptococcus sanguis Type II and Streptococcus mitis which synthesize an amphiphile other than LTA were also inhibited. The findings provided circumstantial evidence for the involvement of LTA in the adhesion of this group of oral bacteria.
TI  - Cloning and expression of a Streptococcus sanguis surface antigen that interacts  with a human salivary agglutinin.
AB  - Human saliva contains a high-molecular-weight glycoprotein (agglutinin) which binds to specific streptococci in a calcium-dependent reaction leading to the formation of bacterial aggregates. We report the cloning of a gene encoding a surface antigen from Streptococcus sanguis M5 and show that the expressed protein inhibits agglutinin-mediated aggregation and specifically binds the salivary agglutinin in a calcium-dependent fashion. Clones isolated from the immunological screening of S. sanguis M5 genomic libraries with polyclonal antibodies against whole cells were assayed for the ability to compete with S. sanguis for agglutinin. One clone, pSSP-5, expressed antigens of 165 and 130 kilodaltons (kDa) possessing this activity. A 3-kilobase-pair (kbp) insert fragment from this clone was used to screen a genomic library in lambda EMBL3 which resulted in the isolation of clone SSP-5A. This clone contained an insert of 17 kb and expressed proteins of 170 to 205 kDa that reacted with the anti-S. sanguis antibodies. Subcloning of a 5.3-kbp EcoRI-BamHI fragment from SSP-5A produced pEB-5, which expressed streptococcal components that were indistinguishable from SSP-5A. The streptococcal antigen was purified by gel permeation and ion exchange chromatography and shown to potently compete with S. sanguis M5 cells for agglutinin. The antigen also bound purified salivary agglutinin in the presence of 1 mM CaCl2. This binding was inhibited by EDTA. Both the SSP-5 antigen and a 205-kDa protein in surface protein extracts from S. sanguis M5 cross-reacted with antibodies directed against antigen B from S. mutans and SpaA from S. sobrinus 6715. These results indicate that a 205-kDa surface protein that is antigenically related to SpaA and antigen B is involved in the binding of salivary agglutinin to S. sanguis M5.

TI  - Effect of topical administration of vancomycin versus chlorhexidine on alpha-hemolytic streptococci in oral cavity.
AB  - In a crossover study the effect of local vancomycin (paste containing 0.5% vancomycin applied to the gums three times a day for 7 days) versus chlorhexidine mouth rinsing (0.2% chlorhexidine solution twice a day for 7 days) on alpha-hemolytic streptococci in the oral cavity was investigated in eight volunteers. Mixed saliva and dental plaque samples were collected for microbiologic analysis before administration, during treatment, and after withdrawal of the agents. The numbers of different alpha-hemolytic streptococci were determined in the samples. The total numbers of Streptococcus mitior, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus sanguis were significantly reduced by the vancomycin treatment compared with the chlorhexidine treatment (p less than 0.05) after 2 days of administration. Two days after the treatment was stopped the numbers of alpha-hemolytic streptococci had returned to pretreatment levels. Local prophylaxis with vancomycin as a complement to systemic antimicrobial prophylaxis may therefore be useful in the prevention of infective endocarditis.
TI  - Penicillin tolerance among oral streptococci.
AB  - Penicillin tolerance was elicited in 18 of 46 strains of viridans streptococci isolated from the mouths of 19 of 20 healthy subjects and in 31 of 54 consecutive blood-culture isolates of streptococci. Enterococci and Streptococcus sanguis were the organisms most frequently tolerant but the property was also common among isolates of S. mutans, S. mitior and Lancefield Group G streptococci. Pneumococci and S. salivarius were rarely tolerant. When incubated with penicillin at 5 x MIC in batch or continuous cultures, both tolerant and sensitive strains of oral streptococci declined in number less rapidly than S. pyogenes. However, combinations of penicillin and gentamicin killed tolerant and sensitive oral streptococci.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence analysis of tetracycline resistance gene tetO from Streptococcus mutans DL5.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans DL5, isolated from the dental plaque of a pig, was resistant to high levels of streptomycin (Sm, 20 mg/ml), erythromycin (Em, 1 mg/ml), and tetracycline (Tc, greater than 100 micrograms/ml), but contained no detectable plasmid DNA. The Smr and Emr determinants were cloned from cellular DNA on the self-replicating 5-kilobase-pair (kbp) EcoRI fragment of pAM beta 1 and the 4.2-kbp cryptic plasmid pVA380-1, respectively, by transformation of Streptococcus sanguis Challis. Helper plasmid cloning, with a Challis host containing pVA380-1, was required to clone the Tcr determinant of strain DL5 on this vector. A single-colony isolate of the original Tcr clone contained a hybrid plasmid, pDL421, composed of 2.6 kbp of vector DNA and 11.4 kbp of S. mutans DNA. Plasmid pDL421 did not hybridize to plasmids containing the streptococcal Tcr determinants tetL, tetM, and tetN. A shortened derivative of this hybrid plasmid, pDL422, missing a 4.9-kbp HincII fragment from the S. mutans DNA but still encoding Tcr, was obtained by subcloning in S. sanguis Challis. The Tcr gene was located in a 1,917-base-pair open reading frame (ORF) corresponding to a 72-kilodalton protein. The ORF exhibited 99.4% sequence identity with the 1,917-base-pair tetO gene from a strain of Campylobacter coli (W. Sougakoff, B. Papadopoulou, P. Nordmann, and P. Courvalin, FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 44:153-160, 1987). A 1.67-kbp NdeI fragment, internal to the ORF from strain DL5, as well as pDL421 hybridized under stringent conditions to DNA from 10 of 10 Tcr strains of C. coli and Campylobacter jejuni from human and animal sources, but not to DNA from Tcs isolates of these two species.
TI  - Identification of viridans streptococci by three commercial systems.
AB  - The API 20S (Analytab Products, Plainview, NY), the GPI card (Vitek Systems, St.  Louis, MO) and the RapSTR system (Innovative Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA) were compared with conventional biochemicals for the identification of viridans streptococci. One hundred nine clinical isolates were tested that included the following species: intermedius (38) sanguis II (20), bovis (variant) (14), mitis (14), salivarius (11), sanguis I (6), constellatus (3), mutans (2), and uberis (1). With initial testing, a correct species call was made with 72% of the isolates with the GPI card, 62% with the RapSTR, and 50% with the API 20S. Identifications of viridans streptococci group or those that needed additional biochemicals for species identification occurred with 28% of isolates with the API 20S, 8% with the RapSTR, and 9% with the GPI card. Incorrect identifications occurred with 6% of the isolates tested by the GPI card, 20% with the API 20S, and 30% with the RapSTR. Most discrepancies with the RapSTR were with 66% of the intermedius isolates, whereas most, 55%, of misidentifications with the API 20S were with sanguis II isolates. No identifications were made with 2% and 13% of isolates with the API 20S and GPI, respectively.
TI  - Effect of spiramycin on adhesiveness and phagocytosis of gram-positive cocci.
AB  - Three strains of Staphylococcus aureus, serotype 18, Cowan I and serotype 66438,  and different species of streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes, Str, mutans, Str. sanguis and Str. faecalis) were tested for their adherence to buccal cells (as measured by interference contrast microscopy) and phagocytosis by rat polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNs) (as measured by fluorescence microscopy with a vital fluorochrome, acridine orange). Pretreatment of cocci with serial two-fold dilutions of spiramycin (from 1/2 to 1/1024 the MIC), increased the diameter of bacterial cells and decreased the adherence of staphylococci and streptococci to buccal cells. Exposure of streptococci to 1/4 the MIC of spiramycin led to an increase of the phagocytic capacity of PMNs. Pretreatment of PMNs with a therapeutic concentration (2 mg/l) also stimulated the phagocytosis of streptococci. Action of spiramycin on the phagocytosis of staphylococci varied according to the strain tested. Although in-vitro results cannot be directly compared with in-vivo data, it is of interest that spiramycin decreases adherence of different Gram-positive cocci and enhances phagocytic capacity of PMNs.

TI  - Role of the arginine deiminase system in protecting oral bacteria and an enzymatic basis for acid tolerance.
AB  - The arginine deiminase system was found to function in protecting bacterial cells against the damaging effects of acid environments. For example, as little as 2.9 mM arginine added to acidified suspensions of Streptococcus sanguis at a pH of 4.0 resulted in ammonia production and protection against killing. The arginine deiminase system was found to have unusual acid tolerance in a variety of lactic acid bacteria. For example, for Streptococcus rattus FA-1, the pH at which arginolysis was reduced to 10% of the maximum was between 2.1 and 2.6, or more than 1 full pH unit below the minimum for glycolysis (pH 3.7), and more than 2 units below the minimum for growth in complex medium (pH 4.7). The acid tolerance of the arginine deiminase system appeared to be primarily molecular and to depend on the tolerance of individual enzymes rather than on the membrane physiology of the bacteria; pH profiles for the activities of arginine deiminase, ornithine carbamoyltransferase, and carbamate kinase in permeabilized cells showed that the enzymes were active at pHs of 3.1 or somewhat lower. Overall, it appeared that ammonia could be produced from arginine at low pH values, even by cells with damaged membranes, and that the ammonia could then protect the cells against acid damage until the environmental pH value rose sufficiently to allow for the reestablishment of a difference in pH (delta pH) across the cell membrane.
TI  - Association of viridans group streptococci from pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis and upper genital tract infection.
AB  - The prevalence and role of viridans group streptococci in the female genital tract have not been well described. In this study of 482 pregnant women, 147 (30%) were culture positive for viridans group streptococci. Of 392 women with predominant Lactobacillus morphotypes by Gram stain (normal), 110 (28%) were colonized with viridans group streptococci, compared with 37 (41%) of 90 women with bacterial vaginosis (BV) (P = 0.02). To determine whether any species were associated with BV, 177 consecutively isolated viridans group streptococci from the vagina were identified to the species level by using the Facklam scheme. The most frequently isolated species from the vagina was Streptococcus intermedius (13%), followed by Streptococcus acidominimus (6%), Streptococcus constellatus (5%), Streptococcus sanguis II (4%), Streptococcus mitis (2%), Streptococcus salivarius (2%), Streptococcus morbillorum (2%), Streptococcus sanguis I (1%), Streptococcus mutans (0.2%), and Streptococcus uberis (0.2%) with an average of 1.2 species per woman. The distribution of the species among women with BV compared with normal women was not significantly different, with the exception of two species which were associated with BV: S. acidominimus (18% versus 3%, P less than 0.001) and S. morbillorum (6% versus 0.7%, P = 0.005). Amniotic fluid and placenta cultures yielded 54 isolates: S. sanguis II (13 isolates), S. acidominimus (9 isolates), S. intermedius (10 isolates), S. constellatus (3 isolates), S. mitis (4 isolates), S. sanguis I (4 isolates), S. morbillorum (5 isolates), S. mutans (2 isolates), S. uberis (1 isolate), mannitol-positive S. intermedius (1 isolate), and 2 isolates which were not classified. The distribution of species isolated from the upper genital tract was not a reflection of the distribution in the lower genital tract. Dextran-producing species of viridans group streptococci may have a greater pathogenic potential in the placenta than the non-dextran-producing species.
TI  - Adherence of streptococci to surface-modified glass.
AB  - Four types of surface-modified glass were prepared. Aminopropyl glass was prepared by alkylsilylation of glass slides with gamma-aminopropyltriethoxysilane. This glass carries primary amino groups which may be protonated at pH 7.2. Owing to the presence of both positively charged ions and hydrophobic ethoxyl groups, the glass is considered to be amphipathic. Three other types of surface-modified glass slides were prepared from aminopropyl glass by forming Schiff's bases with three aldehydes: glucose, glyoxylic acid and hexanal. The aldehyde-treated slides were subsequently reduced using sodium borohydride. Thus, the surface of the glass was rendered hydrophilic, ampholytic or hydrophobic, respectively. The adherence of two Streptococcus sanguis strains and two Streptococcus mutans strains to the surface-modified glass slides was studied. Different strains showed differences in adherence to these slides depending on their physico-chemical surface properties. For S. sanguis ATCC 10556, hydrophobic bonds seemed to be most important, while in S. mutans OMZ 176, ionic interactions made the highest contribution to adhesion. Hydrogen bonds seemed to contribute least to adherence.
TI  - Response of a Streptococcus sanguis strain to arginine-containing peptides.
AB  - For dental plaque organisms such as Streptococcus sanguis, the ecological importance of the ability to utilize arginine as an energy source has been established in previous studies. The present investigation was undertaken to determine the ability of a strain of S. sanguis to process unsubstituted arginine-containing peptides. The organism was grown under glucose-limited conditions in a chemically defined medium, and peptide was added to washed, resting cells in a pH-stat at pH 7.0. Filtrates taken at appropriate time intervals were assayed for peptide, free amino acids, and metabolites. Irrespective of the position of the arginine residue, all peptides tested were attacked, although those that possessed a C-terminal arginine (including a tetrapeptide) were processed at a faster rate than were those in which arginine was N terminal. However, C-terminal arginine was cleaved only slowly from a peptide containing 24 residues. In each case, most of the released arginine was converted to ornithine via the arginine deiminase pathway. Such peptidase activities appeared to occur at or near the cell surface and were probably constitutive. It was found that the organism grew in chemically defined medium containing arginine that was present solely in the form of a tripeptide, and also that a strain of S. mutans possessed only a limited ability to attack arginine-containing peptides and was unable to utilize the released arginine.
TI  - Streptococcal adherence on various restorative materials.
AB  - The adherence of Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556, S. sanguis ATCC 10557, S. mutans Ingbritt, and S. mutans OMZ 176 to the surfaces of composite resins, amalgam alloys, and a Au-Ag-Pd alloy was measured. Adhesion was correlated with values for hydrophobicity and zeta-potential of the bacteria and the restorative materials. The hydrophobicity of the restoratives showed a positive correlation between the numbers of adherent S. sanguis cells, suggesting that hydrophobic interactions are important for the adherence of this bacterial species. In contrast, the numbers of adherent S. mutans cells showed a positive correlation with the zeta-potential of the restoratives, suggesting that electrostatic interactions are important in adherence of this bacterium.
TI  - Cross-sectional analysis of serum antibody to oral streptococcal antigens in children.
AB  - Antibodies to S. salivarius, S. sanguis, and S. mutans cells and to glucosyltransferases (GTF) prepared from these micro-organisms were measured in the sera of 133 infants and children by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). IgG antibody activity to each cell type and GTP was present at birth (presumably derived from maternal transfer) and declined significantly thereafter. IgG antibody levels to S. salivarius and S. sanguis were next detected in young children (2 to less than 3 yr group). However, an increase in IgG antibody to S. mutans cells was not seen until children were older (4 to less than 8 yr group), possibly reflecting the later colonization of this organism. In contrast, IgG antibody to GTF of all three streptococcal species remained at low levels throughout the first four years of life. IgG antibody to S. mutans GTF was then the first to appear (4 to less than 8 yr group). Serum IgA antibodies to all GTFs were not detected until after this time. Fifteen sera were used to develop IgG immunoblots with the GTF antigens. Some positive sera (7/12) demonstrated reaction(s) with GTF from each of the three streptococcal species. Individual sera showed IgG antibody bonds to GTF from several serotypes of the mutans streptococci. No immunoblot reaction was observed with GTF and sera (3) from the four-to-seven-year and younger age groups. These results indicate the presence of serum antibody to bacteria and bacterial products associated with plaque formation very early in life and during and after the pre-adolescent years. The potential exists for this serum antibody to modulate bacterial colonization or accumulation in the oral cavity.
TI  - Microbial flora associated with presence of root surface caries in periodontally  treated patients.
AB  - Examination of saliva and dental plaque was carried out in 35 adults who had been treated for periodontal disease 3 yr earlier. Plaque samples were collected from approximal and buccal sound and carious root surfaces. The samples were analyzed for the presence and proportions of members of Streptococcus, Lactobacillus and Actinomyces. The results showed a low prevalence of root surface caries and a low level of salivary mutans streptococci and lactobacilli. From subjects with root caries there was a not statistically significant tendency to higher proportional levels of mutans streptococci in plaque from carious root surfaces than from caries-free surfaces. An inverse significant relationship between noncarious and carious root surfaces was noted for S. sanguis. The population of A. viscosus and A. naeslundii was similar in plaque samples from sound and carious sites but showed elevated levels in the subjects with five or more new root surface lesions.
TI  - Effect of nutritional constraints on the biosynthesis of the components of the phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system in a fresh isolate of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - A procedure for the purification of enzyme I (EI) and the protein HPr, the general components of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system, from Streptococcus mutans serotype c is presented. The method was also applied successfully to the purification of EI and HPr from Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sobrinus, and Streptococcus sanguis. Using specific antibodies obtained against the proteins purified from S. mutans DR0001, we determined quantitatively by rocket electrophoresis the cellular levels of EI and HPr in a freshly isolated strain of S. mutans grown under various conditions in continuous culture. The activity of a few specific EIIs was also determined by an in vitro phosphorylation test. Results indicated that maximum EII activities for glucose, mannose, and 2-deoxyglucose were obtained under conditions of glucose limitation, at pH 7.0 and low dilution rate (D = 0.057/h). Increasing the amount of glucose or the dilution rate (D = 0.40/h) or decreasing the pH from 7.0 to 5.5 resulted in a 1.4- to 24-fold decrease in these activities. The EII activity for fructose was not influenced by the growth conditions in the same way as the other EIIs. The fructose EII was highest at pH 5.5 and at high dilution rate under conditions of glucose or nitrogen limitation and was always repressed at pH 7.0 and at low dilution rates. The intracellular levels of EI were also dependent on the growth conditions. The highest concentration (0.65 nmol/mg of protein) was observed in cells grown under glucose limitation at pH 7.0 and high dilution rate, and the lowest concentration (0.12 nmol/mg of protein) was found in cells grown under glucose excess at pH 7.0 and high dilution rate. The other general component of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system, the protein HPr, was not influenced significantly by varying growth conditions.
TI  - Degradation of starch and its hydrolytic products by oral bacteria.
AB  - Selected strains of oral bacteria were analyzed for their ability to degrade wheat starch, maltose, maltotriose, and maltoheptaose. S. sanguis IUOM-11M and JC804, S. mutans 6715, S. salivarius IUOM-8, A. viscosus IUOM-62, and A. naeslundii ATCC 12104 degraded all four substrates. S. mutans NCTC 10449 degraded starch, maltose, and maltotriose, while A. viscosus ATCC 15987 degraded starch and maltose, and S. sanguis SS34 degraded only maltose. L. casei IUOM-14 did not degrade any of the substrates. Analysis of starch degradation products from S. sanguis IUOM-11M and A. viscosus IUOM-62 demonstrated oligosaccharides, maltose, and trace amounts of glucose for the former and oligosaccharides, maltotriose, and maltose for the latter. S. sanguis IUOM-11M alpha-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.20) demonstrated a pH optimum of 6.5 and greatly enhanced activity from maltose-cultured cells as compared with cells cultured in glucose or fructose. The presence of fructose in the growth medium prevented this enhancement of activity by maltose. Maltose inhibited sucrose-dependent synthesis of S. sanguis IUOM-11M insoluble polysaccharide and both primer-dependent and primer-independent synthesis of soluble polysaccharide. Maltoheptaose inhibited primer-dependent but not primer-independent soluble polysaccharide synthesis. Several oral bacteria have the ability to hydrolyze starch and to degrade further the products to acidogenic substrates. These products may also inhibit sucrose-dependent synthesis of polysaccharides, which enhances the production of the acidogenic substrate fructose. The results add further support to the growing body of evidence suggesting that caries-promoting properties of starch may be expressed only when starch is present in diets containing sucrose.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of topical anesthetic liquids containing lidocaine or benzocaine.
AB  - Six species of microorganisms commonly found within the oral cavity were exposed  for either one minute or two hours to 5% lidocaine liquid topical anesthetic and benzocaine liquid topical anesthetic. Mixtures of microorganisms and anesthetics were diluted and plated onto a brain heart infusion medium. Reduction in cell viability was 73-100% after exposure to the anesthetic agents when compared with the saline/buffer controls. A significant reduction (p < .005) in cell growth by Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, S. mitis, S. salivarius, Actinomyces viscosus, and Candida albicans was associated with a one-minute and two-hour exposure to lidocaine, benzocaine, 5% lidocaine, and the benzocaine vehicle control. Five percent lidocaine reduced growth of the test orgainisms more than benzocaine in one-minute exposures to S. mutans, A. viscosus and S. salivarius and with a two-hour exposure to S. salivarius.Five percent lidocaine was bacteriocidal or fungicidal to all microorganisms for both time periods whereas, benzocaine liquid topical anesthetic was predominately bacteriostatic or fungistatic after one-minute exposures and bacteriocidal or fungicidal after two hours.The results indicated that two dental liquid topical anesthetics containing lidocaine or benzocaine possessed considerable antimicrobial activity to selected oral microorganisms. The exclusive use of a topical liquid anesthetic may be an adequate means to render the oral mucosa aseptic before injection of a local anesthetic.
TI  - Bacterial agglutinin activity in the saliva of human identical and fraternal twins.
AB  - The major factor in human saliva responsible for the specific aggregation of oral streptococci is a high molecular-weight glycoprotein (agglutinin). To determine if the level of this glycoprotein in whole and parotid saliva was genetically determined, agglutinin activity for Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mutans in saliva obtained from identical and fraternal twins was compared. Evidence for the heritability of agglutinin activity and also parotid flow rate and total protein was obtained. There was no evidence for a significant genetic contribution to salivary sodium concentration.
TI  - Partial characterisation of the inhibitory substances produced by Streptococcus oralis and related species.
AB  - The production of inhibitory substances was sought by deferred antagonism. Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus sanguis produced bactericidal concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, but no detectable bacteriocin. Actinomycetes and Neisseria pharyngis were particularly susceptible to the lethal action of hydrogen peroxide. Streptococcus milleri produced bactericidal concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocin-like substances. S. oralis strains were inhibited by the bacteriocin-like products of strains of Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus salivarius. Inhibition was due neither to complete bacteriophage nor to fermentation end-products. Extracellular polysaccharides formed during growth could not protect sensitive strains from the effect of hydrogen peroxide or bacteriocin-like substances.
TI  - In-vitro adherence of oral streptococci in the presence of sucrose and its relationship to cariogenicity in the rat.
AB  - Streptococcus sanguis I gave a significantly greater percentage coverage (cell-pellicle attachment) of saliva-coated glass in the presence of sucrose than did Strep. sanguis II (p less than 0.025), and both these gave greater percentage coverages than the other species tested, between which no significant differences were noted. There was a large number of significant differences in clump size (cell-cell attachment) between species-pairs. Among the mutans streptococci, there were significant differences in the percentage coverage between Streptococcus rattus/Streptococcus mutans (p less than 0.05) and Strep. rattus/Streptococcus sobrinus (p less than 0.01), and in clump size between all species-pairs with the exception of Streptococcus cricetus or Strep. sobrinus and Strep. mutans. The rank order of species in relation to fissure caries was mutans streptococci greater than Streptococcus salivarius greater than Streptococcus milleri greater than Strep. sanguis greater than Streptococcus faecalis greater than Streptococcus mitis greater than Streptococcus lactis. There was a significant correlation between percentage coverage in vitro and fissure caries in vivo for strains of Strep. sanguis (p less than 0.05) and pooled strains of Strep. mitis and Strep. sanguis (p less than 0.01). On comparing data for adherence in the presence or the absence of sucrose, the sugar had no effect on the percentage coverage of the seven species tested, but significantly increased the clump size of the mutans streptococci (p less than 0.01) and Strep. sanguis (p less than 0.05).
TI  - Biological and biochemical characterization of novel lipid-like antibacterial substances (mutalipocins) produced by Streptoccus mutans strain 32K.
AB  - Two novel antibacterial substances (designated mutalipocins) have been isolated from the culture supernatant of Streptoccus mutans strain 32K (serotype c). The mutalipocins were purified by extraction of the culture supernatant with light petroleum (b.p. range 30-60 degrees C), followed by Lobar column chromatography on Lichroprep RP-8. HPLC indicated that both mutalipocin preparations (ML-I and ML-II) were homogeneous. The Mr values of ML-I and ML-II were less than 1000. Both mutalipocins were unaffected by treatment over the pH range 3.0-10.0, or with phospholipase A or proteolytic enzymes, but were partially inactivated by treatment with lipase or phospholipase C. ML-II was resistant to heat treatment. TLC indicated that ML-I and ML-II contained unsaturated, aldehyde and/or ketone, and ester groups. The inhibition of S. mutans by ML-I and ML-II was due to bactericidal, rather than bacteriostatic, activities. The antibacterial spectra of ML-I and ML-II were narrower and more species-specific than those of bacteriocins produced by other Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of teicoplanin in an in-vitro two-compartment kinetic model.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of teicoplanin was studied in a model system in which antibiotic concentration is continuously varied. A two-compartment open model was used to reproduce, in vitro serum pharmacokinetics of teicoplanin in humans during 24 h after iv administration. Staphylococcal and streptococcal strains of various species were tested. Teicoplanin showed rapid killing of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staph. hominis. All strains of Staph. epidermidis were rapidly killed in spite of the high MIC values (4-16 mg/l). The killing effect against Staph. haemolyticus was less rapid and marked than against Staph. epidermidis, with strain to strain variation. A 99.9% kill was achieved for most strains within 22 h, but with other isolates regrowth occurred which was due to the presence of highly resistant cells in the original population. Other staphylococci (Staph. aureus, Staph. saprophyticus) and Streptococcus pyogenes, Str. bovis and Str. salivarius were reduced by 99.9% within 22 h. Bactericidal activity against other streptococci (Str. mutans, Str. agalactiae, Str. faecalis, Str. faecium) was less marked; against Str. sanguis teicoplanin was bacteriostatic.
TI  - Coronary arteritis in mice after systemic injection of bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan.
AB  - We examined cell wall peptidoglycan (PGL) derived from group A streptococcus and  other bacteria for possible induction of coronary arteritis in mouse strains. The histological finding of the main trunk of the coronary arteries of BALB/c, DBA/1J, C57BL/6 and DBA/2 mice, which were given an intravenous injection of sonicated PGL fragments of st. pyogenes at 500 micrograms per mouse 4 times at intervals of 1 week, showed diffuse cellular infiltration in the vascular wall as well as perivascular space. Marked hyperplasia of the endothelial cells was noted and necrosis of the medial smooth muscle of the coronary artery also was observed. The elastica stain clearly demonstrated fragmentation and degeneration of the elastic fibers. The histological change of the originating site of the aorta also noted swelling or hyperplasia of the endothelial cells and perivascular cellular infiltration. PGL fragments of st. mutans, st. sanguis and s. aureus did not cause any heart lesions. Coronary arteritis induced by st. pyogenes PGL could be very useful as an experimental animal model of Kawasaki's disease.
TI  - Genetic relationships among the oral streptococci.
AB  - Genetic relationships and species limits among the oral streptococci were determined by an analysis of electrophoretically demonstrable variation in 16 metabolic enzymes. Fifty isolates represented 40 electrophoretic types, among which the mean genetic diversity per locus was 0.857. Mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase was not detected in isolates of the sanguis species complex, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase were absent in species of the mutans complex. Clustering from a matrix of Gower's coefficient of genetic similarity placed the 40 electrophoretic types in 10 well-defined groups corresponding to the Streptococcus species S. mutans, S. sobrinus, S. cricetus, S. rattus, S. ferus, S. oralis (mitior), two distinct assemblages of S. sanguis strains, and two subdivisions of "S. milleri." The assignments of isolates to these groups were the same as those indicated by DNA hybridization experiments, and the coefficient of correlation between genetic distance estimated by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and genetic similarity indexed by DNA hybridization was -0.897 (P less than 0.001) for 50 pairwise combinations of isolates. S. ferus, which is widely believed to be a member of the mutans complex, was shown to be phylogenetically closer to species of the sanguis complex.
TI  - Adhesion of oral streptococci from a flowing suspension to uncoated and albumin-coated surfaces.
AB  - A flow cell system was developed which allowed the study of bacterial adhesion to solid substrata at well-defined shear rates. In addition, the system enabled the solid surfaces to be coated with a proteinaceous film under exactly the same shear conditions. In this flow cell system, adhesion of three strains of oral streptococci from a phosphate-buffered solution onto three different substrata was studied as a function of time in the absence and presence of a bovine serum albumin (BSA) coating at a shear rate of 21 s-1. To obtain a wide range in surface free energies (gamma) representative strains (gamma b 38-117 mJ m-2) and solid substrata (gamma s 20-109 mJ m-2) were selected. The number of bacteria adhering was counted microscopically. In the absence of a BSA coating a linear relation was found between the number of bacteria adhering at saturation (nb,s) and the calculated interfacial free energy of adhesion (delta Fadh) for each of the three strains. In the presence of a BSA coating the number of bacteria adhering was greatly decreased in all cases. However, despite the presence of the BSA coating there was still a linear relation between the number of bacteria adhering at saturation and the interfacial free energy of adhesion, calculated on the basis of the surface free energy of the uncoated substrata. It can be concluded that the bare, uncoated substratum still influenced bacterial adhesion in spite of the marked influence of a BSA coating.
TI  - Causes and control of dental caries.
AB  
TI  - The hydrophobicity of 'viridans' streptococci isolated from the human mouth.
AB  - The hydrophobicity of human oral streptococci was measured with the hexadecane assay modified by the incorporation of polyethylene glycol 6000. Large variability in the hydrophobicity between cultures of some strains grown on different occasions was observed whereas other strains were less variable. The variation in hydrophobicity was significantly reduced by growing the cells in continuous culture in a chemostat under glucose-limiting conditions. The Streptococcus mutans strains used all had low hydrophobicity and the mean hydrophobicity of this species was significantly lower (P less than 0.05) than the mean hydrophobicity of Strep. salivarius, Strep. sanguis Type I and Strep. sanguis Type II strains. This finding supports the view that hydrophobicity is a contributing factor in the adhesion of viridans streptococci to oral surfaces.
TI  - Microbial aspects of preventive regimes in patients with overdentures.
AB  - The aim of this study was to test effects of preventive regimes using fluoride and chlorhexidine to prevent caries and periodontal diseases in 34 patients with overdentures. The patients, who were treated with immediate overdentures, were distributed at random into three experimental groups. In these groups, different gels--a placebo, a fluoride, and a chlorhexidine-fluoride gel--were tested by daily application. Supragingival plaque samples from selected surfaces of two abutment teeth were taken at one week, and at one, three, and six months after initial insertion of the overdenture. The placebo and fluoride gel influenced neither total CFU nor S. sanguis and A. viscosus/naeslundii counts. In the placebo group, but not in the fluoride group, S. mutans levels increased significantly, indicating the caries risk involved in overdentures. The use of chlorhexidine-fluoride gel resulted in a long-term suppression of total CFU. Further, S. mutans was found to be selectively suppressed to below detection level. A. viscosus/naeslundii was initially strongly suppressed, but after three months a partial return of the population was noticed. S. sanguis was relatively insensitive to the chlorhexidine-fluoride gel. It is concluded that a daily application of a chlorhexidine-fluoride gel is effective against plaque formation and S. mutans on abutment teeth in overdentures.
TI  - Effect of sodium and amine fluoride treatment on adsorption and ultrastructure of S. mutans and S. sanguis.
AB  - A new modification of hydroxyapatite (HA) adherence assay is presented to study the effect of two chemically different fluorides, sodium fluoride (2% solution) and amine fluoride (Elmex sol. concentrate) on the adsorption of S. mutans (ATCC 27351) and S. sanguis (ATCC 10556). Vaseline-coated glass rods were rolled in HA powder, after which the rods were either coated or not coated with salivary pellicle. Both strains adsorbed better to saliva-coated rods. Pretreatment of the rods with fluorides did not much affect the adsorptions. Treatment of bacteria with the fluorides, however, very significantly reduced the adsorption in both strains (P less than 0.001). The fluoride treatments also reduced bacterial viabilities, and electron microscopy revealed a distinct toxic effect, in particular among the amine fluoride treated specimens.
TI  - Environmental pH as a factor in the competition between strains of the oral streptococci Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, and "S. mitior" growing in continuous culture.
AB  - Strains of Streptococcus mutans (biotype 1), Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus mitior have been grown in mixed continuous culture in a semidefined medium under glucose limitation at a growth rate of D = 0.1 h-1. The effect of varying the environmental pH on the proportions of the different populations within the community has been determined. Initially the populations were allowed to reach steady state at pH 7.0 when S. sanguis was dominant with S. mutans and "S. mitior" maintaining similar populations. The medium pH was then lowered in steps of 0.5 pH units from pH 7.0 to 4.5, and the community was grown at each step for at least 15 generations. Viable counts of each species were made at 24-h intervals. The population ratios established at pH 7.0 remained relatively stable when the environmental pH was set at pH 6.5. However, after the medium pH was lowered to 6.0 (days 18-27), the population of S. mutans began to increase and the S. mitior population began to decline. A further change was seen at pH 5.5 (days 27-34) when S. mutans became dominant, S. sanguis declined, and S. mitior was not detectable. At pH 4.5, both S. mutans and S. sanguis were reduced in numbers, but survived until the experimental run was terminated (44 days). Samples of culture fluid were taken throughout the experiment and analyzed for the presence of the acid products of glucose metabolism. The amounts of lactic acid produced by the community increased as the environmental pH was lowered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Relationship between dental plaque indices and bacteria in dental plaque and those in saliva.
AB  - A variety of indices has been developed for the quantitation of dental plaque. The aim of this study was to determine the correlation between the Loe plaque index and the number of bacteria on the same tooth. Furthermore, the effect of plaque accumulation on the salivary counts of some dental plaque organisms was estimated. Twenty volunteers were asked to abstain from all oral hygiene for a one-week period. Clinical indices and bacteriological samples were taken at the start and at the end of the experimental period. After an interval of seven days, the experiment was repeated. The relationship between the Loe plaque index and the total bacterial counts on the same area of the tooth was found to be highly significant. After seven days without oral hygiene, the total counts and the Actinomyces viscosus/naeslundii and Streptococcus sanguis counts in dental plaque had increased by approximately two log units, while the Streptococcus mutans counts had increased by more than one log unit. The large increase in the number of bacteria on the teeth was reflected in the salivary counts of the Actinomyces species, but not in the S. sanguis or S. mutans counts. This was due to differences in ecological habitats of these species in the mouth. Highly significant correlations were found between the S. mutans level in dental plaque and the salivary level, and between the S. mutans counts of the subjects in the first and second trials of the experiment.
TI  - A mixed-culture chemostat system to predict the effect of anti-microbial agents on the oral flora: preliminary studies using chlorhexidine.
AB  - A mixed-culture chemostat system, composed of nine bacterial species representative of plaque in health and disease, has been assessed as an improved laboratory method of evaluating the likely in vivo effects of antimicrobial agents used in dentistry. The advantages of the system include reproducibility, the long-term stable cultivation of bacteria under controllable conditions, and repeated sampling, for bacteriological and biochemical studies, without disrupting the stability of the community. The effects of (i) the continuous provision of chlorhexidine (CHX) and (ii) three pulses of CHX (final concentration in both experiments = 0.24 mmol/L) on the composition of the chemostat communities were monitored. Only L. casei survived the continuous provision of CHX; the other bacteria were killed and were lost at different rates which generally corresponded to their known sensitivities to CHX. After each CHX pulse, the numbers of bacteria fell markedly. Again, L. casei was least affected, while A. viscosus, B. intermedius, and F. nucleatum were temporarily undetectable but returned to their original levels within 2-4 generation times. Counts of S. mutans were affected more by CHX than those of S. sanguis or S. mitior. The effect of successive pulses of CHX on the viability of some bacteria and on acid production (as measured by pH-fall experiments) decreased, suggesting that adaptation to CHX had occurred. The fact that the in vitro observations paralleled previous clinical findings suggests that the mixed-culture system could be used as a predictive model of the probable effect on the oral flora of new anti-microbial agents prior to expensive trials in animals or human volunteers.
TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of a Streptococcus sanguis DNase necessary for repair of DNA damage induced by UV light and methyl methanesulfonate.
AB  - We developed a method for cloning cellular nucleases from streptococci. Recombinant lambda gt11 bacteriophage containing streptococcal nuclease determinants were identified by the production of pink plaques on toluidine blue O DNase plates. We used this technique to clone a 3.2-kilobase-pair EcoRI fragment with DNase activity from the chromosome of Streptococcus sanguis. The locus was designated don (DNase one) and could be subcloned and stably maintained on plasmid vectors in Escherichia coli. Minicell analyses of various subclones of the don locus allowed us to determine the coding region and size of the Don nuclease in E. coli. The don gene product had an apparent molecular mass of 34 kilodaltons and degraded native DNA most efficiently, with lesser activity against denatured DNA and no detectable activity against RNA. S. sanguis don deletion mutants were constructed by transformation of competent cells with in vitro-prepared plasmid constructs. S. sanguis don deletion mutants retained normal transformation frequencies for exogenously added donor DNA. However, when compared with Don+ wild-type cells, these mutants were hypersensitive to DNA damage induced by UV light and methyl methanesulfonate. An S. sanguis don-specific DNA probe detected homology to chromosomal DNA isolated from Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus mutans Bratthall serogroups d and g. Our results suggested that the don locus was the S. sanguis allele of the previously described S. pneumoniae major exonuclease and was involved in repair of DNA damage. Furthermore, hybridization studies suggested that the don locus was conserved among species of oral streptococci.

TI  - Colonization of the human oral cavity by a Streptococcus mutans mutant producing  increased bacteriocin.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans strain JH1005 is a mutant that produces levels of bacteriocin activity three-fold-elevated than those produced by its parent, JH1001. A single infection regimen with JH1005 was found to result in persistent colonization of the teeth of all three adult subjects tested. This is a significant improvement over JH1001, which required multiple exposures in order to colonize the teeth of humans reliably. The levels of total cultivable bacteria and indigenous S. sanguis were not affected by JH1005 colonization. In two of the three subjects, total (indigenous plus JH1005) S. mutans levels were significantly decreased. The results provide additional support for the role of bacteriocin production as an ecological determinant in colonization by S. mutans. They also indicate that a practical regimen for infection by an effector strain might be achieved for use in the replacement therapy of dental caries.
TI  - Membrane-associated and solubilized ATPases of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - The proton-translocating, membrane ATPases of oral streptococci have been implicated in cytoplasmic pH regulation, acidurance, and cariogenicity. Membranes were isolated from Streptococcus mutans GS-5 and Streptococcus sanguis NCTC 10904 following salt-induced lysis of cells treated with lysozyme and mutanolysin. The ATPase activities of these membranes were 1.8 and 1.1 units per mg membrane protein, respectively. F1 ATPases were washed free from the membranes and purified by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC). Hydrolytic activities of the F1 ATPases were maximal at pH values between 6.0 and 6.6, whereas the membrane-bound enzymes had pH maxima of 7.5 (S. sanguis) and 6.0 (S. mutans). The F1 ATPases of the streptococci were similar to the well-characterized enzyme of Escherichia coli; they consisted of five different polypeptides and had apparent, aggregate molecular weights of from 335 to 350 Kd. The membrane-bound ATPases were characterized biochemically and found to be similar to those of proton-translocating ATPases of E. coli and Streptococcus faecalis. Km values for the membranes with respect to ATP were found to be 0.9 and 1.0 mmol/L for S. mutans and S. sanguis, respectively. Both enzymes had specificities for purine triphosphates and were active with a variety of divalent cations, although optimal activity occurred with ATP and Mg. The membrane-associated enzymes were sensitive to the inhibitors dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) and azide, but insensitive to ouabain and vanadate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Characterization of a rat salivary sialoglycoprotein complex which agglutinates Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Rat saliva agglutinated Streptococcus mutans Ingbritt and NCTC 10449 and Streptococcus sanguis NCTC 7864 but not S. mutans NCTC 10921, GS 5, or LM 7, Streptococcus sobrinus 6715-13 or OMZ 65, or Streptococcus cricetus HS 6, as measured turbidometrically. The specificity of agglutination by rat saliva was the same as that by human saliva. Agglutination was associated with a mucin complex (rat salivary agglutinin complex [rS-A]) of sulfated sialoglycoproteins, with a trace of associated lipid and an apparent Mr of 1.6 X 10(6), isolated by gel-filtration Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography. The complex was dissociated in a high-ionic-strength buffer containing 6 M urea and then fractionated by gel filtration and anion-exchange Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography into four sulfated sialoglycoprotein components, designated rS-A-1Q1, rS-A-1Q2, rS-A-1Q3, and rS-A-2, with rS-A-1Q2 being polydisperse through differential glycosylation of the polypeptide backbone. The dissociation destroyed agglutination activity. The polypeptide backbones contained up to 42% serine plus threonine and up to 40% glycine plus alanine plus proline plus valine. The carbohydrate moiety of the rS-A sialoglycoproteins consisted of N-acetylgalactosamine, sialate, galactose, fucose, N-acetylglucosamine, and small amounts of mannose, with the predominant sugar being N-acetylgalactosamine. Agglutination was inhibited by 1 mM EDTA but was restored by 1.5 mM CaCl2. Agglutination was also inhibited by 5 mM CaCl2; nonimmune sera; cationic polymers; and wheat germ, lentil, soybean, and peanut lectins. However, agglutination was not affected by lipoteichoic acid, various anionic proteins, or various sugars. Neuraminidase treatment of rS-A did not affect activity, but tryptic digestion of S. mutans did prevent agglutination. The results are consistent with calcium bridging the negative groups within the rS-A complex and allowing the approach of rS-A to the bacterial cell surface to effect a specific conformational attachment.
TI  - Rate of plaque formation--some clinical and biochemical characteristics of "heavy" and "light" plaque formers.
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to give a clinical and biochemical characterization of two groups of individuals with different rates of plaque formation. From 133 individuals, 9 "heavy" and 10 "light" plaque formers were selected. The mean plaque index after 3 days of plaque accumulation, on buccal surfaces of premolars and first molars, was 2.6 for the "heavy" and 0.6 for the "light" plaque formers. The following variables were determined: periodontal status, DFS, dietary habits, salivary secretion rate and buffer effect, S. mutans and lactobacillus counts in saliva, salivary content of IgA, lactoferrin, lactoperoxidase and lysozyme, saliva-induced aggregation of certain oral streptococci, gel electrophoresis of saliva, amino acid composition of saliva and the acquired pellicle and retention depth of the dentogingival area. Comparing the two groups of plaque formers, statistically significant differences were found for the following three variables: parotid saliva-induced aggregation of a strain of S. sanguis, content of glutamic acid in the acquired pellicle and retention depth of the dentogingival area for maxillary premolars. Large variations for all studied variables were found, both within and between the groups. Several factors may be involved in plaque formation and none of the studied variables alone could explain the large difference in the amount of plaque formed after 3 days between the "heavy" and "light" plaque formers.
TI  - Oxygen sensitivity of sugar metabolism and interconversion of pyruvate formate-lyase in intact cells of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - Pyruvate formate-lyase (PFL) (formate acetyltransferase; EC 2.3.1.54) of oral streptococci is essential for metabolizing sugar into volatile compounds (formate, acetate, and ethanol). This enzyme is extremely sensitive to oxygen, and its activity is irreversibly inactivated by oxygen. When Streptococcus sanguis was anaerobically starved, a part of the active form of PFL was converted into a reversible inactive form that was tolerant of oxygen. This reversible inactive enzyme could be reactivated to the active enzyme by anaerobic sugar metabolism, with the recovery of volatile compound production. The PFL in Streptococcus mutans was not converted into an oxygen-tolerant inactive form by anaerobic starvation, and after exposure of the cells to oxygen the PFL could not be reactivated. These findings suggest that S. mutans can produce acids rapidly under anaerobic conditions because of its capacity to keep PFL active and that S. sanguis can protect its sugar metabolism from oxygen impairment because of its interconversion of PFL.
TI  - [Identification of Streptococcus viridans in clinical specimens].
AB  - In a 4 year prospective study of "viridans" or non-groupable streptococci 100 clinically significant strains were isolated. Strains were defined as significant when found in two or more samples of blood cultures, or when seen on Gram staining together with inflammatory reaction. Fifty-two strains were speciated by 10 physiological characteristics. In 42 cases additional tests were performed. Only 16 isolates were unidentifiable by the techniques used. Sources of isolates included purulent lesions (53%) (mainly S. milleri and S. mitior); endocarditis (27%) (S. bovis I, S. sanguis, S. mutans, S. bovis II) and urinary tract infections (10%) (S. bovis II, S. milleri).
TI  - Infection with the bacterium Streptococcus mutans and salivary IgA antibodies in  mothers and their children.
AB  - Salivary IgA-antibody titres against different streptococcal antigens were measured in 64 mothers and their first-born children. Their presence and the level of Streptococcus mutans had been monitored for several years. The children had carried this bacterium for various lengths of time and now had varying numbers of salivary Strep. mutans. The subjects had participated in a longitudinal study completed one and a half years before, concerning prevention of early colonization of the child's mouth by Strep. mutans through measures undertaken by the mother. Whole-saliva samples were collected from all subjects and analysed by ELISA techniques for total IgA, and for IgA antibodies to whole cells of Strep. mutans serotype c and d, whole cells of Strep. sanguis, purified polysaccharide and protein antigens of Strep. mutans serotype c and d; a pool of Escherichia coli antigens was used as a control. No significant differences were found in the level of any of the specific IgA antibodies in children with different levels of indigenous Strep. mutans. A tendency to higher IgA antibody activity was found in children who had levels of Strep. mutans first detectable after three years of age and who had carried the bacterium for six months or less. The IgA antibody activity to Strep. mutans specific serotype c antigen and to whole cells of Strep. mutans serotype c (JC 2) was significantly higher in children with no caries experience when compared to children with more than two df-surfaces. This study offers no clear evidence for a protective role of salivary IgA antibodies against Strep. mutans colonization.
TI  - Effects of NaF and SnF2 on growth, acid and glucan production of several oral streptococci.
AB  - The effects of low concentrations of these fluorides on Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitior and Streptococcus sanguis were investigated. Without fluoride, mutans streptococci (Strep. mutans and Strep. sobrinus) produced more acid than the other strains; both fluorides reduced acid production in all strains. NaF had little effect on growth; SnF2 decreased growth in all strains, most evidently in the Strep. mutans. In all growth conditions, Strep. sobrinus produced the most alkali-soluble glucan. Both fluorides enhanced alkali-soluble glucan production in mutans streptococci while only SnF2 enhanced this in the other streptococci.
TI  - Isolation, chemical and biological characterization of sulphated glycoproteins synthesized by rat buccal and palatal minor salivary glands in vivo and in vitro.
AB  - 35S-labelled sulphated glycoproteins (SGP) were isolated from these glands after  the incorporation of radiosulphate in vivo and in vitro by fractionation of tissue and medium extracts on Sepharose 4B and partial purification by DEAE-Sephacel anion exchange chromatography. Fractions were assessed for purity by SDS-PAGE and by cellulose-acetate electrophoresis. Molecular weights ranged from 34,000 to 5 X 10(6). It was notable that the molecular size of SGP from the in vitro media was generally lower than from the corresponding tissue fractions, particularly for the palatal samples. The fractions were heterogeneous and contained no sulphated glycosaminoglycans; they had high levels of aspartic acid, glutamic acid, threonine and serine, but there was no major difference in amino-acid composition between them. Carbohydrate analysis indicated typical components associated with sulphated glycoproteins, including fucose, galactose, glucose, mannose, N-acetylgalactosamine, N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylneuraminic acid. Protein:carbohydrate ratios ranged from 0.1:1.0-3.5:1.0 and ester sulphate from 0.8 to 16.2 per cent. All fractions exhibited blood-group A reactivity and aggregated Streptococcus sanguis NCTC 7864; several fractions interacted similarly with Streptococcus mutans OMZ61.
TI  - Isolation of bacteria lytic against Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10558 from human dental plaque.
AB  
TI  - A simple method for determining extracellular polysaccharide-producing ability of oral streptococci.
AB  - A simple method is described for determining the types of extracellular polysaccharides produced by oral streptococci. The method yields quantitative results in which the amount of polysaccharides produced is normalised with respect to DNA. Results correlate well with previously published data for oral streptococci, except in the case of Streptococcus oralis for which there is no previously published data. All species within the mutans group produced both soluble and insoluble glucan; while soluble fructan was only produced by strains of Streptococcus rattus and Streptococcus mutans. The major extracellular polysaccharide produced by Streptococcus salivarius was soluble fructan, although some strains produced soluble and insoluble glucan. Most Streptococcus sanguis strains produced soluble and insoluble glucan. Soluble fructan was produced by some strains of S. sanguis and S. oralis. The latter also produced soluble and insoluble glucan. No detectable extracellular polysaccharide was elaborated by Streptococcus milleri, Streptococcus faecalis or Streptococcus lactis.
TI  - The effect of smokeless-tobacco extracts on the growth of oral bacteria of the genus Streptococcus.
AB  - Aqueous tobacco extracts were used to supplement a basic salts solution (BSS) and a microbial medium. Thin-layer chromatography revealed sucrose in only one of four extracts. Discs saturated with extracts (0.1-50 mg/ml) failed to inhibit growth of any of the micro-organisms. Supplementation (10 mg/ml) of BSS with the tobaccos lacking sucrose resulted in augmented growth of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus sanguis whereas the sucrose-containing brand augmented only Strep. sanguis growth. Thus extracts of these smokeless tobaccos would serve as a growth substrate for three species of oral streptococci which are frequently associated with human dental caries.
TI  - Streptococcus mutans, lactobacilli and Streptococcus sanguis in plaque from abutment teeth of cemented and of loose retainers.
AB  
TI  - A simplified diagnostic system for cultural detection and enumeration of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - A simple dip-slide test (Cariescreen SM) based on MSB selective agar was devised  for detection and quantitation of Streptococcus mutans in oral samples. For this test, a bacitracin tablet is dissolved in a vial containing buffered saline diluent. Paraffin-stimulated saliva is collected in this diluent vial. A dip slide which incorporates a modified MSB agar (minus bacitracin) is immersed briefly in the diluted saliva. After addition of a CO2-generating tablet, the screw-cap dip slide is closed tightly in the vial and incubated for two days at 37 degrees C and one day at room temperature. S. mutans populations in saliva are estimated by comparison with a colony density chart. Growth of reference strains of S. mutans was equivalent on Cariescreen SM dip slides and on MSB agar plates. Reference strains of Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitis, and Streptococcus milleri did not grow on Cariescreen SM dip slides. Aliquots of saliva from 50 schoolchildren and 51 adults were tested by the dip-slide method and by conventional plating methods in MSB agar. Very good correlation (0.93) between the two methods was obtained. This simplified S. mutans detection system is suitable for use by clinical personnel in dental clinics or other non-laboratory settings for identification of subjects potentially at risk for caries.
TI  - [Bacteriological investigation of the cariogenic effects of sugar alcohols and sucrose].
AB  - Considerable evidence indicates that the disaccharide, sucrose is probably the major dietary factor in dental caries formation and much subsequent research has gone into the search for another sweetener to replace sucrose. Currently, there is much interest in the development of new sweeteners and the cariogenic properties of sugar alcohols. The present study aimed to examine the cariogenic properties of sugar alcohols (xylitol, sorbitol, mannitol) and sucrose on growth pattern and acid production of S. mutans, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. faecalis, S. viridans, L. casei and L. acidophilus in vitro by using Photo Electrical Colorimeter and pH meter. In conclusion the results in this study showed that out of sugar alcohols, xylitol is the only compound which, depending on its concentration, significantly did not affect the growth and acid production of all tested micro organisms.
TI  - Bactericidal action of carbon dioxide laser radiation in experimental dental root canals.
AB  - The ability of a carbon dioxide laser to sterilize the root canal of human teeth  has been investigated. Three oral bacteria, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, and Actinomyces viscosus, and three other bacteria, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were used as experimental organisms. Exposure of cells on glass slides to laser radiation showed there was little difference in the exposure required to kill these six organisms. Complete recovery of bacteria from the root canal was initially a problem and was only achieved when bacterial manipulations and removal were carried out in rapid succession, within 5 min of inoculation. However, the geometry of the instrumented canal and the laser alignment were major factors in achieving consistent cell death of oral bacteria in the root canals. Using sets of 10 teeth, four repeated exposures of 10 W for 1 s was found to sterilize 4 or more of the teeth.
TI  - Renaturation of dextranase activity from culture supernatant fluids of Streptococcus sobrinus after sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  - A rapid and reproducible method for the assay of individual fractions of the multicomponent dextranase activity of Streptococcus sobrinus after reduction/denaturation and electrophoresis in acrylamide gels is described. Multiple forms of dextranase, possible virulence factors in the formation of dental caries by oral Streptococci (S. mutans, S. sobrinus, S. sanguis, S. cricetus, and S. rattus), have been separated in sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gels into which an indicator substrate, blue dextran, has been incorporated, and identified after renaturation to remove the reducing/denaturing agents of the Laemmli buffer system.
TI  - Molecular and genetic characterization of lactose-metabolic genes of Streptococcus cremoris.
AB  - Lac+ plasmid DNA from Streptococcus cremoris H2 was subcloned with an Escherichia coli vector on a 3.5-kilobase-pair PstI-AvaI fragment. Genetic analysis of the cloned DNA was possible because linear Lac+ DNA fragments were productive in the S. sanguis transformation system. Complementation of S. sanguis Lac-mutants showed that the 3.5-kilobase-pair fragment included the structural gene for 6-phospho-beta-D-galactosidase and either enzyme II-lac or factor III-lac of the lactose-specific phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system. Expression of the S. cremoris-like 40,000-dalton 6-phospho-beta-D-galactosidase in S. sanguis Lac+ transformants, rather than the 52,000-dalton wild-type S. sanguis enzyme, demonstrated the occurrence of gene replacement and not gene repair. The evidence supports chromosomal integration as the mechanism by which S. sanguis Lac- recipients are converted to a Lac+ phenotype after transformation with Lac+ DNA. Southern blot data suggest that the Lac+ DNA does not reside on a transposon, but that integration always occurs within a specific HincII fragment of the recipient chromosome. Hybridization experiments demonstrate homology between the S. cremoris Lac+ DNA and cellular DNA from Lac+ strains of Streptococcus lactis, S. mutans, S. faecalis, and S. sanguis.
TI  - Coagglutination reactions between Candida albicans and oral bacteria.
AB  - An agglutination assay for detecting intermicrobial adherence between the cells of Candida albicans and various oral bacteria is described. Strains of Streptococcus sanguis, S. salivarius, S. mutans, S. mitis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Actinomyces viscosus all coagglutinated with C. albicans. No interaction could be demonstrated between the cells of Bacteroides melaninogenicus and those of C. albicans. Preliminary investigations of these interactions suggest that binding of F. nucleatum and A. viscosus to C. albicans is mediated by bacterial proteins, possibly lectins. Other mechanisms must account for the binding of oral streptococci to C. albicans. The possible implications of these findings in relation to oral mucosal colonisation and oral candidal clearance are discussed.
TI  - Xylitol metabolism in xylitol-sensitive and xylitol-resistant strains of streptococci.
AB  - The metabolism of xylitol in xylitol-sensitive strains (strains whose growth is inhibited by xylitol) and xylitol-resistant strains (growth not inhibited) of oral streptococci was compared. Both xylitol-sensitive and xylitol-resistant strains took up xylitol. In the sensitive cells, the xylitol was probably transported via a phosphotransferase system. This resulted in intracellular accumulation of xylitol-5-phosphate and xylulose-5-phosphate. These metabolites were not detected in the xylitol-resistant strains, which probably transported xylitol via a permease system. It appeared that the resistant strains were able to utilize xylitol as carbon and energy source in the absence of other carbohydrates.
TI  - Acid tolerance, proton permeabilities, and membrane ATPases of oral streptococci.
AB  - Differences in acid tolerance among representative oral streptococci were found to be related more closely to the dynamic permeabilities of the bacteria to protons than to differences in the sensitivities of cell membranes to gross damage caused by environmental acidification. For Streptococcus mutans GS-5, Streptococcus sanguis NCTC 10904, and Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 13419, gross membrane damage, indicated by the release of magnesium from whole cells, occurred at pH values below about 4 and was rapid and extensive at pH values of about 3 or less. A more aciduric, lactic acid bacterium, Lactobacillus casei ATCC 4646, was more resistant to environmental acidification, and gross membrane damage was evident only at pH values below 3. Assessments of the movements of protons into S. mutans cells after an acid pulse at various pH values indicated that permeability to protons was minimal at a pH value of about 5, at which the average half time for pH equilibration across the cell membrane was about 12 min. The corresponding values for the less aciduric organism S. sanguis were pH 7 and 8.2 min, and the values for the intermediate organism S. salivarius were pH 6 and 6.6 min. The ATPase inhibitor dicyclohexylcarbodiimide acted to increase markedly the permeability of each organism to protons, and this action indicated that permeability involved not only the passive inflow of protons but also active outflow through the proton-translocating membrane ATPase. Membranes were isolated from each of the bacteria, and pH profiles for ATPase activities indicated pH optima of about 7.5, 7.0, 6.0, and 5.0 for S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. mutans, and L. casei, respectively. Thus, the pH profiles for the enzymes reflected the acid tolerances of the bacteria and the permeabilities of whole cells to protons.
TI  - High-performance liquid chromatographic analysis of bacterial fatty acid composition for chemotaxonomic characterization of oral streptococci.
AB  - A high-performance liquid chromatographic method was developed to analyze the fatty acid composition of bacterial lipids. After saponification of lipids extracted from bacteria, the liberated fatty acids were labeled with a fluorescence reagent, 4-bromomethyl-7-acetoxycoumarin, followed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic separation and fluorescence detection. All bacterial fatty acids were simultaneously separated within 30 min and sensitively determined. This method was applied to the chemotaxonomic characterization of oral streptococci. The fatty acid composition of phospholipids and total lipids distinguished Streptococcus mutans from any other species examined and showed that Streptococcus sanguis had a close taxonomic relationship with Streptococcus salivarius.
TI  - Calcium-dependent salivary agglutinin with reactivity to various oral bacterial species.
AB  - Human parotid agglutinins from three individuals were isolated by adsorption to and desorption from strains of Streptococcus mutans belonging to serotypes a, b, c, d, and e and strains of Lactobacillus casei, Actinomyces viscosus, and Streptococcus sanguis. The desorption was achieved by suspending centrifuged saliva-coated microorganisms in 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) containing 0.154 M sodium chloride. After another centrifugation, agglutinin activity was recovered in the supernatants. The L. casei strain was not agglutinated by any of the agglutinin extracts or by saliva, but all the other strains were agglutinated to a variable extent. However, all strains, including the nonagglutinating L. casei strain, adsorbed and desorbed agglutinins active for other strains. The agglutinin extracts from S. mutans serotype c, S. sanguis, and A. viscosus were purified and characterized by electrophoretic and immunological techniques. The purified preparations were positively stained for protein and carbohydrate, and the molecular weights were estimated to be 440,000. All agglutinin extracts needed calcium in the range of 0.1 to 0.5 mM to be active, and for a single strain, all agglutinins gave the same degree of agglutination, indicating that the isolated agglutinins may be of the same molecular species, a hypothesis that was also confirmed by the preliminary characterization of the purified agglutinins. This type of agglutinin, which seems to exert its activity among various bacterial species, could be important in mediating bacterial coaggregation and thus may add to the effect of specific agglutinins in the clearance of bacteria from the human mouth.
TI  - Estimation of growth parameters for some oral bacteria grown in continuous culture under glucose-limiting conditions.
AB  - The coexistence of bacteria in natural environments can often be explained in terms of competition for a growth-limiting substrate(s), and the outcome of such competition depends upon relevant growth parameters such as substrate affinity and yield. Dental plaque bacteria are frequently carbon and energy limited. Growth parameters for seven oral Streptococcus species and one Actinomyces viscosus strain were estimated under glucose-limited conditions in continuous culture. In all strains, mixed-acid fermentation occurred at low growth rates, while amounts of lactate increased at higher growth rates. Two important growth parameters, mumax and Y glucose, were very similar in the two serotype c Streptococcus mutans strains (T8 and Ingbritt), one of the serotype d/g Streptococcus mutans strains (OMZ65), and the two Streptococcus milleri strains (699B3 and B448). Two other serotype d/g S. mutans strains (KIR and B13) were divergent from this group and had lower mumax values and a lower Y glucose. The maintenance energy coefficients were lower in the S. mutans serotype c strains, and the highest values were observed in the S. milleri strains. While A. viscosus had a lower mumax, its lower maintenance rate and significantly higher yield indicate that it deals much more efficiently with glucose than do the streptococci. The most striking feature of amino acid utilization was that arginine was completely consumed by S. milleri strains; similarly, A. viscosus used up all available asparagine as did one of the S. milleri strains at faster growth rates. It is suggested that the ability of strains of S. milleri and S. sanguis to utilize arginine in addition to carbohydrate as a source of energy may explain why such organisms increase in proportion in the plaque of subjects consuming diets almost devoid of fermentable carbohydrate.
TI  - The intra-oral effect on enamel demineralization of extracellular matrix material synthesized from sucrose by Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The role of extracellular matrix material (EMM) synthesized from sucrose (S) by Streptococcus mutans IB-1600 in altering the demineralizing potential of artificial plaque was evaluated with an intraoral enamel demineralization test (IEDT). The artificial plaque samples were prepared from cells cultivated in Todd-Hewitt broth (THB) supplemented with various S concentrations and by mixing THB-grown cells with increasing proportions of EMM (heat-killed THB + 2% S-cultivated cells). The samples were also evaluated for cell density (DNA content) and acidogenicity in vitro (pH-stat), as well as for in situ pH changes during a 45-minute intra-oral test following a 10% glucose rinse. An increase in the proportion of EMM relative to cell density was associated with an increase in enamel demineralization. This trend reversed when the ratio of cells to EMM was less than 1:19. Experiments involving strains of S. mitis, S. sanguis, and S. salivarius suggested a similar effect of EMM. The intra-oral pH data suggest that the presence of EMM may enhance demineralization by altering diffusion properties of plaque.
TI  - Variable colonization by oral streptococci in molar fissures of monoinfected gnotobiotic rats.
AB  - Germfree Sprague-Dawley rats, fed a high-sucrose diet, were monoinfected with strains of Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus mutans. Viable cell recoveries from six molar teeth, considered to reflect mainly bacterial colonization of intact fissures, were in the order of 10(6), 10(7), and 10(8) CFU, respectively. Some of the implications of the variation of bacterial plaque-forming ability in the rat model are discussed.
TI  - The effect of lowering the pH on the composition and metabolism of a community of nine oral bacteria grown in a chemostat.
AB  - Nine oral bacteria, associated with both healthy and diseased sites in the mouth, were grown at D = 0.05 h-1 (mean generation time 13.9 h) in a glucose-limited chemostat. After an initial period of steady-state growth at pH 7.0, pH control was discontinued. The pH then decreased until it stabilized at pH 4.1 after 9 d (16 generations), while the Eh rose from -165 mV to +160 mV. The lowering in pH resulted in the composition and metabolism of the flora being altered and in increased bacterial aggregation. At pH 7.0, 'Streptococcus mitior', Veillonella alcalescens and S. sanguis were most numerous while at pH 4.1 the counts of all bacteria fell except for Lactobacillus casei, which became predominant. The proportions of S. mutans within the community also increased while S. sanguis was recovered only occasionally and Bacteroides intermedius was not detected below pH 4.6. The survival at pH 4.1 of several other species would not have been predicted from earlier pure culture studies. Relative to pH 7.0, the community growing at pH 4.1 produced more lactic acid, washed cells had a greater glycolytic activity over a wider pH range but amino acid metabolism decreased. In general, when pH control was restored, so were the original patterns of metabolism and bacterial counts, except for B. intermedius, which was still not detected. The inverse relationship between S. sanguis and S. mutans, and the increase in proportions of L. casei and S. mutans during growth in a low pH environment parallel observations made in vivo and suggest that the chemostat can be used as a model for microbial behaviour in dental plaque.
TI  - Characterization of genetic transformation in Streptococcus mutans by using a novel high-efficiency plasmid marker rescue system.
AB  - We developed a marker rescue system for study of competence development and genetic transformation in Streptococcus mutans. The system involved the recombinational rescue of a tetracycline resistance (Tcr) determinant by a homologous, inactive locus (Tcs because of a small deletion). Streptococcal cells harboring this in vitro-prepared Tcs construct (pVA1208) were restored to Tcr when plasmid (pVA981) DNA was used as donor material. pVA981 contained the intact streptococcal Tcr locus and was unable to autonomously replicate in streptococci. Marker rescue with this system followed first-order kinetics and occurred at a frequency 8- or 160-fold higher than did transformation with homologous chromosomal or plasmid DNA, respectively. By using the rescue system, we were able to confirm that competence of S. mutans appeared to be inducible. This was indicated by a sequential increase and then decrease in Tcr transformation frequencies during growth in complex medium. Also, donor DNA binding was not sequence specific, since the recovery of Tcr transformants was reduced by increasing the concentrations of heterologous DNA. We investigated the fate of donor DNA and the kinetics of plasmid establishment in the transformation of S. mutans with plasmid DNA. Monomeric plasmid molecules transformed S. mutans as a second-order process, whereas multimeric plasmid DNA and chromosomal markers were recovered as a first-order process. Approximately 50% of the initially bound donor plasmid DNA was found to remain in a trichloroacetic acid-insoluble form. Our results suggested that molecular cloning in S. mutans would be conducted most efficiently by using helper plasmid systems or shuttle vectors and that gene transfer by transformation of S. mutans occurred in a manner similar to that observed in Streptococcus sanguis.
TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of scrB, the structural gene for the Streptococcus mutans phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sucrose phosphotransferase system sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase.
AB  - A DNA fragment encoding the sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase component of the Streptococcus mutans phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sucrose phosphotransferase system has been recovered from a plasmid-based genomic library of strain GS5. The locus, designated scrB, was found to reside within a 2.9-kilobase-pair restriction fragment present on the chimeric molecule pVA1343 (7.3 kilobase pairs). Minicell analysis of pVA1343-directed translation products revealed that the scrB product synthesized in Escherichia coli V1343 was a single peptide of Mr 57,000. This polypeptide was reactive with antiserum prepared against S. mutans intracellular invertase, which has been previously shown to have an Mr of 43,000 to 48,000. The basis of this difference in Mr was not established but may represent a posttranslational proteolytic event which occurred in S. mutans but not in recombinant V1343. Sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase purified to homogeneity from V1343 exhibited Michaelis constants of 180 mM for sucrose and 0.08 mM for sucrose-6-phosphate. Deletion analysis of pVA1343 facilitated the assignment of a coding region for the hydrolase within the insert, as well as an orientation for the transcription of scrB. scrB-defective strains of S. mutans constructed by additive integration of an insertionally inactivated scrB locus exhibited the sucrose sensitivity characteristic of this mutant class. Similar loci were detected by DNA-DNA hybridization in additional strains of S. mutans and two strains of Streptococcus cricetus, but not in single strain representatives of S. rattus, S. sobrinus, S. sanguis I and II, S. salivarius, or S. mitis.
TI  - Strains of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus attach to different pellicle receptors.
AB  - We compared the levels of adsorption of Streptococcus mutans JBP and Streptococcus sobrinus 6715 to experimental pellicles formed from unsupplemented and glucosyltransferase (GTF)-supplemented saliva. Pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite beads from GTF or from saliva-GTF mixtures possessed detectable GTF activity. Low levels of GTF activity were also detected in clarified whole human saliva, but not in samples of submandibular saliva. The adsorptive behavior of S. mutans JBP to pellicles formed from saliva or saliva-GTF mixtures was strikingly different from that of S. sobrinus 6715. S. mutans JBP adsorbed in higher numbers to pellicles formed from whole or submandibular saliva than to buffer-treated hydroxyapatite under the assay conditions used, in which blocking with albumin was used. In contrast, S. sobrinus 6715 attached in lower numbers and did not show enhanced adsorption to pellicles prepared from saliva. Pellicles prepared from the high-molecular-weight mucin fraction of submandibular saliva effectively promoted adsorption of S. mutans JBP, but none of the saliva fractions tested enhanced the attachment of S. sobrinus 6715 above the levels of buffer controls. Exposure of pellicles which contained GTF to sucrose to permit in situ synthesis of glucan markedly enhanced attachment of S. sobrinus 6715 but not attachment of S. mutans JBP. Also, the presence of sucrose throughout the adsorption period did not enhance attachment of S. mutans JBP. Both organisms possessed cell-associated GTF, and GTF preparations derived from S. sobrinus 6715 and Streptococcus sanguis FC-1 behaved like GTF derived from S. mutans JBP. S. sobrinus 6715 attached in high numbers to dextran-treated hydroxyapatite, whereas S. mutans JBP did not. These observations suggest that S. mutans JBP cells possess an adhesin which binds to salivary components in the pellicles. In contrast, S. sobrinus 6715 cells appear to possess an adhesin which binds to glucan in the pellicles. Four additional strains of S. mutans and four additional strains of S. sobrinus behaved qualitatively like strains JBP and 6715, respectively, and thus the differences observed appear to be representative of these species. Collectively, our data indicate that S. mutans and S. sobrinus attach to different receptors in experimental pellicles.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of a 60-kilodalton salivary glycoprotein with agglutinating activity against strains of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - A bacterial agglutinin specific for strains of Streptococcus mutans was isolated  from human saliva. Physiochemical analyses showed the agglutinin to be a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 60,000. The agglutinin aggregated four of the eight strains of Streptococcus mutans tested but did not aggregate the strains of Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus mitis tested. Chemical modification of carbohydrate moieties of the agglutinin with sodium metaperiodate had no effect on aggregation, whereas modification of the polypeptide portion with trypsin abolished aggregating activity. A set of five murine hybridoma antibodies was employed to further analyze the agglutinin. Two carbohydrate-specific antibodies, directed against D-mannose and N-acetylgalactosamine moieties, respectively, failed to block agglutinin- or whole saliva-mediated aggregation of S. mutans cells. In contrast, two antibodies directed against pronase-sensitive antigenic sites blocked both agglutinin- and saliva-mediated aggregation of S. mutans cells. Western blot analysis with the agglutinin-specific hybridoma antibodies demonstrated the agglutinin in whole saliva and in artificial tooth pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite beads incubated with saliva. These results suggest that a 60-kilodalton glycoprotein of human saliva is a bacterial agglutinin with specificity for certain strains of S. mutans. They further suggest that aggregation is mediated by polypeptide rather than carbohydrate determinants of the glycoprotein.
TI  - Comparative adhesion of seven species of streptococci isolated from the blood of  patients with sub-acute bacterial endocarditis to fibrin-platelet clots in vitro.
AB  - The adhesion to fibrin-platelet clots in vitro of 21 strains of streptococci isolated from the blood of patients with sub-acute bacterial endocarditis (SABE) was measured. The species, in order of greatest adhesion, were Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus milleri, Streptococcus sanguis, dextran-positive Streptococcus mitior, dextran-negative Streptococcus mitior and Streptococcus salivarius. Individual strains within species, however, cannot be assumed to be representative of their species and may exhibit unusually high or low adhesion. Adhesion depended upon both bacterial concentration and period of contact. There was no simple relationship between ability to adhere and liability to cause endocarditis. Formation of dextran did not increase adhesion. The streptococci were more adhesive than strains of Escherichia coli and Neisseria sicca and less adhesive than strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes.
TI  - Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of antibodies to nutritionally variant streptococci in patients with endocarditis.
AB  - The viridans streptococci are responsible for 50%-55% of microbial endocarditis.  Among these varied species, the nutritionally variant streptococci (NVS) have recently been associated with culture-negative endocarditis and are responsible for 5%-10% of all streptococcal endocarditis. The isolation and identification of these bacteria has been hampered by the extremely fastidious nature of their growth requirements as well as by their slow growth rate. In addition, their antibiotic sensitivity varies greatly, a characteristic leading to a higher rate of morbidity and mortality than is found in patients with non-NVS endocarditis. For these reasons sera from patients with NVS endocarditis were examined for antibodies to the NVS serotype I antigen by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Seventy-four percent of patients with NVS endocarditis had elevated titers to this antigen. None of the sera from controls and only 6.7% of the sera from patients with non-NVS streptococcal endocarditis showed increased titers. These results indicate that antibody to the NVS serotype I antigen can serve as a marker for NVS endocarditis.
TI  - Salivary immunoglobulin A and serum antibodies to Streptococcus mutans ribosomal  preparations in dental caries-free and caries-susceptible human subjects.
AB  - Caries-free subjects or individuals with low caries susceptibility exhibited significantly higher (P less than 0.001) levels of naturally occurring salivary immunoglobulin A (IgA) and serum IgG, IgA, and IgM antibodies to a Streptococcus mutans ribosomal preparation than subjects with high caries susceptibility. Absorption of saliva and serum samples with S. mutans ribosomal preparations, but not with other S. mutans antigens or with Escherichia coli and Neisseria gonorrhoeae ribosomal preparations, removed the antibody activity. Absorption with Streptococcus sanguis ribosomes and NH4Cl-washed S. mutans ribosomes partially removed the anti-S. mutans ribosome antibody activity. These results provide evidence that naturally occurring salivary and serum antibodies to the S. mutans ribosomal preparation correlate with susceptibility to dental caries.
TI  - In vitro activity of A-16686, a new glycopeptide.
AB  - A-16686 is a novel glycopeptide antibiotic derived from Actinoplanes. A-16686 inhibited hemolytic streptococci groups A, B, C, F, and G at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.06 to 0.5 microgram/ml, with 90% inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml, including erythromycin-resistant isolates. S. bovis, various viridans groups streptococci, S. mitis, S. mutans, and S. sanguis were inhibited by less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, and MICs of S. faecalis and S. faecium were 0.5-2 micrograms/ml. Most staphylococci, including methicillin-resistant strains, were inhibited by 1 or 2 micrograms/ml. A-16686 was bactericidal with minimal difference between MIC and MBC for gram-positive species. A-16686 did not inhibit Enterobacteriaceae or Pseudomonas.
TI  - Safety and antibacterial properties of controlled release SnF2.
AB  - Two clinical studies were performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an intracoronal device for the controlled release of SnF2. SnF2-polycarboxylate cement, containing approximately 72 mg F-, was placed in subjects' molars requiring two-surface restorations. In the trial for safety, eight subjects had the restoration in place for 34 days. The salivary fluoride levels were elevated to a mean of 0.3/10(6) over the experimental period. Urinary fluoride levels were only above baseline levels during the first few days. The restoration's physical properties were adequate; however, subjects experienced gingival irritation in areas where the restoration was contacted with gingiva. In the trial for efficacy, fourteen subjects had either a SnF2-polycarboxylate or a placebo restoration placed in a molar tooth during a 2 week period of no oral hygiene. During the experimental period, the control subjects had higher levels of salivary total CFU, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mutans: while the subjects with the SnF2 restoration had increased S. sanguis and decreased S. mutans levels. No differences in G.I. or PL 1 scores were noted between groups. Further development of this controlled release system should include using the SnF2-polycarboxylate restoration in more than one tooth per subject to increase the fluoride reservoir, and not allowing the restoration to contact gingival tissues.
TI  - Lysis of Streptococcus sanguis by an extracellular enzyme from the bacterium Streptococcus mutans from human dental plaque.
AB  - The ability of crude extracellular enzyme produced by the oral bacterium Streptococcus mutans AL7-1 to lyse living cells of Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556, 10557 and 10558 was examined. This enzyme showed lytic activity of living cells and cell walls of only Strep. sanguis ATCC 10558 strain and severed at random the long chains of this strain of living cells. Early log phase cells of this strain were more sensitive to this lytic enzyme than were late-log phase cells. In view of these results, the relationship between this lytic enzyme from Strep. mutans and a decrease in the number of serotype III strains of Strep. sanguis in dental plaque is discussed.
TI  - Effect of monoclonal antibodies against lipoteichoic acid from the oral bacterium Streptococcus mutans on its adhesion and plaque-accumulation in vitro.
AB  - Five monoclonal antibodies directed against Streptococcus mutans strain JBP lipoteichoic acid (LTA) were characterized. They were all similarly reactive with the immunizing LTA-containing extract, with intact Strep. mutans JBP cells and with LTA purified from Lactobacillus casei. Immobilized anti-LTA antibodies removes LTA from LTA-containing extracts. The binding of antibodies to LTA was inhibited by the aqueous extract but not by the organic extract of de-acylated LTA, indicating reactivity with the polyglycerol-phosphate portion of the molecule. Antibodies were reactive with all serotypes of Strep. mutans, as well as with strains of Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis and L. casei, but not with LTA-negative species Streptococcus mitis or Actinomyces viscosus. Anti-LTA antibodies at doses of 0.3 or 3.0 micrograms/ml, had no effect on the adherence of Strep. mutans JBP to experimental salivary pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite, but enhanced adherence 150-300 per cent at 30 micrograms/ml. There was no effect of anti-LTA antibodies in a chemostat model which measured sucrose-dependent plaque accumulation by Strep. mutans. The results argue against a major role for LTA in Strep. mutans adherence or plaque accumulation in vitro.
TI  - The influence of diet on the growth of streptococcal bacteria on the molar teeth  of monkeys (Macaca fascicularis).
AB  - The rates of regrowth of bacteria in developmental grooves on these teeth were determined. Plaque was removed from palatal grooves up to 96 h after cleaning and the number of bacteria and of individual streptococcal species were determined; Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus mitior were the major ones. In monkeys fed one of three different diets, the numbers of each species reached stable levels 18-24 h after tooth cleaning. The median doubling times of the streptococcal population were 4.69, 3.82 and 4.25 h for two maintenance diets and a sucrose diet, respectively. The median doubling times of individual species ranged from 2.01 to 4.38 h and appeared to be independent of the composition of the various diets. There was no difference in the number of bacteria in 18 h-old plaque from discrete sites in fed or fasted monkeys, nor in the numbers of streptococci, except that the size of the Strep. mitior population increased significantly with fasting. Thus host-derived substrates, possibly salivary components, may be used by plaque bacteria and support their on growth in developmental grooves in the absence of food.
TI  - Enamel demineralization by acid produced from endogenous substrate in oral streptococci.
AB  - Bovine enamel blocks were covered by a bacterial cell mass and held in the mouths of human volunteers by a palatal appliance, to study the effects of acid production from endogenous bacterial substrate on the pH of the mass and on enamel demineralization. Variables were cells with and without endogenous substrate, rinsing with 10 per cent glucose or sucrose solution, or no rinsing and the type of organism. Acid production from endogenous substrate by Streptococcus mutans strain IB-1600, due, at least in part, to intracellular glycogen degradation, caused a marked and prolonged pH drop and significant enamel demineralization. A similar but less marked effect was obtained with a strain of Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguis and Actinomyces viscosus. Thus acid production from endogenous sources by plaque bacteria may be of importance in the aetiology of dental caries.
TI  - Effects of highly concentrated stannous fluoride and chlorhexidine regimes on human dental plaque flora.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the effect of an intensive antimicrobial treatment on the number of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus/Actinomyces naeslundii, and the total Colony-forming Units (CFU) in plaque. The dentition of human volunteers was treated in a dental office with either chlorhexidine (5%) or stannous fluoride (8%). Following the office treatment with chlorhexidine, selected volunteers rinsed daily at home for seven or 49 days with chlorhexidine solution (0.2%), while another group flossed daily at home for seven days with dental floss impregnated with chlorhexidine. On days one, seven, 21, 35, and 49 after the local applications, we took saliva samples and plaque samples from fissures, smooth surfaces, and approximal areas. Chlorhexidine and stannous fluoride suppressed S. mutans and the Actinomyces species on all surfaces and in saliva. S. mutans on tooth surfaces was suppressed for approximately seven days and returned to the baseline level at day 21. A. viscosus/naeslundii was suppressed for more than seven days on the teeth. S. sanguis and the total CFU returned to the baseline level within seven days on all surfaces and in saliva. Rinsing or flossing with chlorhexidine suppressed S. mutans during the period of time that these supplements were used. Brushing for seven days with chlorhexidine gel (1%) without a preceding intensive chlorhexidine treatment had virtually no effect on S. mutans in approximal areas and in saliva, but suppressed S. mutans in fissures and on smooth surfaces.
TI  - Effect of human lysozyme on 2-deoxyglucose uptake by Streptococcus mutans and other oral microorganisms.
AB  
TI  - Immunological study of lactate dehydrogenase from Streptococcus mutans and evidence of common antigenic domains with lactate dehydrogenases from lactic bacteria.
AB  - Rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against purified Streptococcus mutans L-(+)-lactate dehydrogenase reacted with the purified enzyme, giving a marked deviation of its kinetic parameters. The enzyme affinity for pyruvate or NADH decreased in the presence of antibody, the affinity for fructose 1,6-diphosphate (FDP) appeared to be slightly affected, and the cooperativity of the ligand binding was lowered. A partial protective effect was observed when the enzyme was preincubated with FDP prior to the antibody adjunction. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay allowed detection of a 30% decrease in enzyme-antibody fixation when FDP was added. The protective effect observed with FDP could be correlated with a conformational change induced by the activator. A decrease of antibody binding in the presence of FDP was also obtained with S. sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus, and Lactobacillus casei lactate dehydrogenases, which reflects a similar mechanism of activation among lactic bacteria. NADH did not offer any protection against antibody inhibition or fixation, and the coenzyme affinity decrease could be attributed to an indirect mechanism. On the contrary, pyruvate and the immunoglobulins apparently could compete for specific binding sites. A decrease of antibody binding was also obtained with three heterologous lactic bacterial lactate dehydrogenases, indicating a conservation of antigenic determinants implicated in the substrate binding.
TI  - Longitudinal microbiological investigation of a hospitalized population of older  adults with a high root surface caries risk.
AB  - Intact root surfaces of chronically hospitalized subjects were sampled periodically to enumerate bacterial species believed to be associated with root caries. Bacteria were cultivated and enumerated using a series of selective and enriched media. Microbial counts, isolation frequencies, and percent cultivable flora data were analyzed for caries-active and caries-free surfaces and subjects. S. mutans, S. sanguis, A. viscosus, A. naeslundii, total lactobacilli, and Veillonella accounted for a mean of less than 20% of the cultivated flora, with mitis salivarius agar cultivable streptococci averaging less than 5%. The microbial count data were highly variable, precluding the finding of significant differences in caries association for either subjects or sites. Streptococci, especially S. mutans, correlated highly with lactobacilli in the samples.
TI  - Albumin as a blocking agent in studies of streptococcal adsorption to experimental salivary pellicles.
AB  - A procedure involving blocking with bovine albumin was useful for differentiating between streptococcal interactions with components of experimental salivary pellicles similar to those which form on teeth and potential interactions with uncoated areas of mineral.
TI  - Colonization of the human oral cavity by a strain of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans strain JH1001 produces a bacteriocin that can kill virtually all other strains of this micro-organism. The ability of JH1001 to colonize the human oral cavity was tested in a study involving five subjects and three different infection regimens, all of which involved multiple exposures to large numbers of organisms. Two and one-half years after infection, JH1001 was found to have persistently colonized three of the subjects. The indigenous S. mutans in one subject were reduced below the level of detection. Levels of (total) S. mutans and S. sanguis were not affected in persistently colonized subjects. Mutants of indigenous S. mutans resistant to the bacteriocin were not observed. The results indicate the importance of host variability and infection regimen for superinfection by this strain of S. mutans. The efficient replacement of indigenous S. mutans by JH1001 in one subject lends support to the eventual application of replacement therapy to the prevention of dental caries.
TI  - Evaluation of the API 20 STREP system for species identification of "viridans" streptococci isolated from bacteremia.
AB  - Species identifications of 71 strains of viridans streptococci isolated from blood and 4 reference strains were made by the API 20 STREP system (API system S. A., Montalieu-Vercien, France) and the conventional method. There are high levels of agreement between results obtained with the both methods for determining acidification from carbohydrate except inulin. The API 20 STREP system correctly identified 74.7% of the viridans streptococci with 9.3% low descrimination, 12% incorrect and 4% unidentified. All strains of S. mitis, S. mutans, S. salivarius and S. anginosus-constellatus were correctly identified. The correct identification rates for S. sanguis I, S. sanguis II and S. MG-intermedius were 88.9%, 68% and 61% respectively. The difference of inulin reaction and the taxonomy discrepancy may be the cause of different identification. The study indicates that the API 20 STREP system has a good potentiality for species identification of viridans streptococci at present time, however, further refinement in needed.
TI  - The surface free energy of oral streptococci after being coated with saliva and its relation to adhesion in the mouth.
AB  - Contact angle measurements on layers of bacteria were used to determine the bacterial surface free energy (gamma b) of a variety of oral streptococcal strains, both without and after being coated with human whole saliva. At least four isolates of each species, either freshly isolated or laboratory strains, were used. The species Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, and S. salivarius were homogeneous, having high surface free energies, and were not affected by saliva treatment (gamma b = 106 +/- 12 and 107 +/- 10 erg X cm-2 in the absence and presence of saliva coating, respectively; n = 20). S. mitis had a very low surface free energy (46 +/- 15; n = 5), which was significantly increased after salivary adsorption (71 +/- 14 erg X cm-2; p less than 0.002). The species S. milleri contained strains with both high and low gamma b. Calculation of the interfacial free energy of adhesion (delta F adh) for bacteria from a saliva suspension to solid surfaces with various arbitrary surface free energies (gamma s) showed that, theoretically, most strains will encounter thermodynamically favorable conditions for adhesion to surfaces with a gamma s above 62 erg X cm-2. However, S. mitis strains not coated with saliva would only be able to adhere to surfaces with gamma s lower than this value. Saliva-coating reverses the calculated relationship with gamma s for these strains. The results indicate that an enamel surface with a low gamma s value would be thermodynamically unfavorable for adhesion of most oral streptococci.
TI  - The establishment of reproducible, complex communities of oral bacteria in the chemostat using defined inocula.
AB  - Nine commonly isolated oral bacterial populations were inoculated into a glucose-limited and a glucose-excess (amino acid-limited) chemostat maintained at a constant pH 7.0 and a mean community generation time of 13.9 h. The bacterial populations were Streptococcus mutans ATCC 2-27351, Strep. sanguis NCTC 7865, Strep. mitior EF 186, Actinomyces viscosus WVU 627, Lactobacillus casei AC 413, Neisseria sp. A1078, Veillonella alkalescens ATCC 17745, Bacteroides intermedius T 588 and Fusobacterium nucleatum NCTC 10593. All nine populations became established in the glucose-limited chemostat although Strep. sanguis and Neisseria sp. were present only after a second and third inoculation, respectively. In contrast, even following repeated inoculations, Strep. mutans, B. intermedius and Neisseria sp. could not be maintained under glucose-excess conditions. A more extensive pattern of fermentation products and amino acid catabolism occurred under glucose-limited growth; this simultaneous utilization of mixed substrates also contributed to the higher yields (Y molar glucose) and greater species diversity of these communities. Microscopic and biochemical evidence suggested that cell-to-cell interactions and food chains were occurring among community members. To compare the reproductibility of this system, communities were established on three occasions under glucose-limitation and twice under glucose-excess conditions. The bacterial composition of the steady-state communities and their metabolic behaviour were similar when grown under identical conditions but varied in a consistent manner according to the nutrient responsible for limiting growth. Although a direct simulation of the oral cavity was not attempted, the results show that the chemostat could be used as an environmentally-related model to grow complex but reproducible communities of oral bacteria for long periods from a defined inoculum.
TI  - Indifferent streptococci in normal and purulent eyes of neonates.
AB  - The incidence of indifferent streptococci in the eyes of neonates less than 6 days old was investigated. The isolation of indifferent streptococci was significantly higher in infants with sticky eyes. Speciation using a shortened identification scheme was carried out on isolates; Streptococcus mitior and Streptococcus sanguis were the most common species in both purulent and non-infected eyes. Streptococcus mutans, a species not normally found in edentulous infants, comprised 14% of indifferent streptoccoi from neonates with sticky eyes but only 1% of those from infants with non-purulent eyes. It is suggested that the role of indifferent streptococci in neonatal conjunctivitis will be resolved only if speciation is performed.
TI  - Bacterial profiles of subgingival plaques in periodontitis.
AB  - In this report over 400 subgingival plaque samples taken from over 110 patients were examined microscopically and culturally for 30 bacterial parameters. The patients could be placed into six disease categories based upon clinical criteria. The bacterial profile of each clinical category was generally distinctive of that category. Periodontal patients who had been successfully treated and maintained had plaques that were populated by significantly higher proportions of Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus, A. odontolyticus and S. mutans and significantly lower proportions of B. gingivalis and spirochetes compared to the five untreated disease categories. The spirochetes were the overwhelming microbial type in the plaques of adult periodontitis (AP) patients, averaging about 45% of the microscopic count. The bacteriological results could not distinguish between ADA Type III and IV periodontitis, suggesting that the same type of infection was occurring in an active site in any AP patient. The patients designated as early onset periodontitis (EOP) differed from the other patients by their relative youth and by their significantly higher proportions of Bacteroides gingivalis and/or B. intermedius. Two types of EOP were recognized in which the most diseased variant was characterized by having an average of 49% spirochetes in the plaque. Four localized juvenile periodontitis (LJP) patients were notable in not having detectable A. actinomycetemcomitans. The data indicate that the various types of periodontitis, with the possible exception of LJP are specific anaerobic infections involving spirochetes and to a lesser extent B. gingivalis and B. intermedius.
TI  - Cloned gtfA gene of Streptococcus mutans LM7 alters glucan synthesis in Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans LM7 (Bratthall serotype e) chromosomal DNA was partially digested with EcoRI and ligated into the positive-selection plasmid vector pOP203(A2+). The ligation mixture was transformed into Escherichia coli, and transformants were selected for tetracycline resistance. Recombinant-bearing clones were screened for their ability to ferment raffinose, using the procedure of Robeson et al. (J. Bacteriol. 153:211-221, 1983). One raffinose-fermenting clone was isolated and found to contain a plasmid with an insert consisting of four EcoRI fragments totalling approximately 10.3 kilobases (kb). This strain was capable of growth on defined medium plus raffinose or sucrose and generated reducing sugars from a sucrose substrate. Southern hybridization analysis of the four EcoRI fragments revealed homology not only to S. mutans LM7 chromosomal DNA but also to S. mutans serotypes b, c, and f. Subcloning of this fragment array into a streptococcal E. coli shuttle vector indicated that a 2.4-kb EcoRI fragment was essential for sucrase activity. E. coli minicell experiments revealed a gene product of 55 kilodaltons. These data along with restriction endonuclease analysis and Southern hybridizations suggested that the cloned S. mutans LM7 gene was closely related to the gtfA gene cloned by Robeson et al. from S. mutans PS13 (Bratthall serotype c). The shuttle plasmid containing the 2.4-kb fragment was transformed into Streptococcus sanguis, which subsequently displayed increased sucrase activity in both intracellular and extracellular fractions. Elevated levels of synthesis of alcohol-insoluble and water-insoluble glucans were observed with crude extracellular fractions of the S. sanguis strain bearing the 2.4-kb fragment. An isolate cured of the shuttle plasmid plus the 2.4-kb fragment displayed wild-type S. sanguis glucan synthesis. In S. sanguis, this gtfA allele may play a role in glucan synthesis by interacting with extant high-molecular-weight glucosyltransferases.
TI  - Immunoelectrophoretic study of cell surface antigens from different Streptococcus mutans serotypes and Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - Antigens prepared from culture supernatants or whole cells of several cariogenic  strains were examined by immunoelectrophoresis for their crossed antigenicity, with reference to Streptococcus mutans OMZ175, serotype f. Crossed immunoelectrophoresis revealed a crossreactivity between soluble extracellular and wall associated antigens of six strains of Streptococcus mutans and one strain of Streptococcus sanguis. Protease destroyed the immunoreactivity of crossreactive antigens. One of them was shown to be localized on the bacterial surface.
TI  - Cross-reactions between alpha-streptococci and Omniserum, a polyvalent pneumococcal serum, demonstrated by direct immunofluorescence, immunoelectroosmophoresis, and latex agglutination.
AB  - In recent years several groups have used serological methods to demonstrate pneumococcal capsular antigens in sputum. In the present study 123 strains of alpha-hemolytic streptococci (including 97 strains from sputum or pharyngeal specimens) were tested for cross-reactions with a polyvalent antipneumococcal serum (Omniserum). Representatives of the following species were included: Streptococcus bovis, S. equinus, S. intermedius, S. lactis, S. milleri, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. sobrinus, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. suis, and Aerococcus viridans. Serological reactions were detected by direct immunofluorescence, immunoelectroosmophoresis, and latex agglutination. Fifteen (12%) of the strains gave positive reactions by all three methods. Positive reactions were also observed with another 32 strains (26%) with two of the methods, whereas 37 strains (30%) gave positive reactions by just one technique. Altogether 84 (68%) strains gave positive reactions with one or more of the methods. Latex agglutination gave positive reactions with 26 (21%) strains compared with 57 (46%) in immunofluorescence and 63 (51%) in immunoelectroosmophoresis. Absorption of the antiserum with one alpha-hemolytic strain reduced but did not entirely eliminate the cross-reactions with five tested strains. These findings indicate a potential risk of cross-reactions with polyvalent antipneumococcal serum in tests carried out on sputa or other specimens which may be contaminated with alpha-hemolytic streptococci.
TI  - Effect of oral nutrient limitation of gnotobiotic rats on acidogenic properties of dental plaque formed by oral streptococci.
AB  - The acid production rate of dental plaque, formed by different streptococci in gnotobiotic rats fed a high sucrose diet or starved for seven or eight days, was determined in vitro. Starvation had no appreciable effect on acid production. This supports the idea that the small pH-lowering ability of plaque of caries-free or stomach tube-fed people in whom exposure of the teeth to fermentable carbohydrate is relatively low or negligible results from a change in the bacterial population rather than a change in the rate of acid production by an unaltered flora.
TI  - Dissipation of the proton motive force in oral streptococci by fluoride.
AB  - Strains of oral streptococci maintain an intracellular pH (pHi) that is more alkaline than the external pH (pHo). The delta pH (pHi-pHo) was about 0.6 in neutral media and about 0.9 in media of pH 5.5. Addition of 10 micrograms of F- per ml at pH 7.0 reduced the delta pH in Streptococcus salivarius to 0.17. The reduction of delta pH in S. sanguis H7PR3 was less pronounced, whereas the delta pH in S. mutans IB 1600 was unaffected. The F- -resistant mutant of S. salivarius, strain Flr103, maintained a delta pH of 0.51 with 100 micrograms of F- per ml. Addition of F- to cells in media below pH 6.0 led to a reduction of delta pH in all strains. The anion had no effect on the transmembrane electrical gradient of either mutant or parental cells of S. salivarius at pH 7.0. The principal effect of F- addition at neutral pH, therefore, was on the delta pH component of the proton motive force. At pH 5.5, 100 micrograms of F- per ml reduced the transmembrane electrical gradient from 71 to 40 mV in the parent and from 80 to 42 mV in the mutant. We propose that the greater sensitivity of cells to F- at lower medium pH stems from the rapid dissipation of delta pH by the anion. Thus, pH equilibration in media of low pH would lead to a greater reduction of metabolic activity than when it occurs in media at neutral pH. The data also suggest that the growth of streptococci, with or without added F-, is limited when the intracellular pH falls below about 5.7.
TI  - Chemical properties and immunobiological activities of streptococcal lipoteichoic acids.
AB  - Lipoteichoic acids (LTAs) were chromatographically purified from crude phenol-water extract of whole cells of some streptococcal species, which included Streptococcus pyogenes Sv, Streptococcus mutans 6715, and Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556. Among these, special attention was paid to S. pyogenes LTA for analyses of chemical composition and biological activities. All LTA preparations contained equimolar amounts of glycerol and phosphorus. Chemical analyses showed that S. pyogenes LTA contained glycerophosphate, alanine, glucose, and fatty acids (as palmitic acid) at molar ratio of 1 : 0.1 : 0.1 : 0.25. The crude phenol-water extract and isolated LTA from S. pyogenes Sv were found to be mitogenic for spleen cells of BALB/c and BALB/c (nu/nu) mice, but not for thymus cells of BALB/c mice. The mitogenicity of deacylated LTA (dLTA) was significantly lower than that of LTA. It was also found that various LTA preparations possessed polyclonal B cell activation ability and adjuvant activity both in vivo and in vitro, as demonstrated by using hemolytic plaque assay. LTA, but not dLTA, induced macrophage activation which resulted in tumor cytotoxicity in mice. Limulus lysate activity of S. pyogenes LTA was approximately 1,000 fold lower than that of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide. These results indicate that streptococcal LTA possesses various immunobiological activities that modulate lymphoreticular system in vivo and in vitro.
TI  - pH change in artificial dental plaque formed by glucosyltransferase and some oral bacteria during batch and continuous culture.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans alone or cell-free glucosyltransferase (G-Tase)-together with either Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Actinomyces viscosus, or Lactobacillus casei cells-formed artificial dental plaque that firmly adhered to glass electrodes in a continuous culture system containing sucrose. The pH in these artificial plaque samples decreased more than did that of the surrounding medium. In the absence of GTase, the bacteria other than S. mutans did not form firmly-adhering plaque on glass electrodes. The pH of the plaque formed with GTase alone did not show the pH decrease seen when the plaque contained bacteria, but, because it catalyzed the synthesis of glucan, it is suggested that the glucan acts as a diffusion barrier to retard acid loss from plaque containing acid-producing bacteria.
TI  - The phylogenetic position of Streptococcus and Enterococcus.
AB  - Streptococcus pyogenes, S. equinus, S. bovis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. mutans, S. rattus, S. cricetus, S. lactis, S. raffinolactis and Enterococcus faecalis have been characterized by oligonucleotide cataloguing of their 16S ribosomal RNA. All the organisms form a loose but coherent group that is phylogenetically equivalent to those of lactobacilli, bacilli, the Brochothrix and Listeria group, and related taxa that constitute one of several sublines within the 'Clostridium' branch of Gram-positive eubacteria. Within the Steptococcus-Enterococcus group, organisms fall into three moderately related clusters defined by Enterococcus, the lactic acid streptococci and streptococci of the pyogenic and oral groups, respectively.
TI  - Lactate dehydrogenase from Streptococcus mutans: purification, characterization,  and crossed antigenicity with lactate dehydrogenases from Lactobacillus casei, Actinomyces viscosus, and Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - A cytoplasmic fructose-1,6-diphosphate-dependent lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; EC 1.1.1.27) from Streptococcus mutans OMZ175 was purified to homogeneity as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. The purification consisted of ammonium sulfate precipitation of the cytoplasmic fraction, DEAE-Sephacel and Blue-Sepharose CL.6B chromatography, and Sephacryl S200 gel permeation. The catalytic activity of the purified enzyme required the presence of fructose-1,6-diphosphate with a broad optimum between pH 5 and 6.2. The concentration of fructose-1,6-diphosphate required for half-maximal velocity was around 0.02 mM and was affected by the pyruvate concentration. The enzyme seemed to have at least two binding sites for the activator which interact in a cooperative manner. Increasing concentrations of fructose-1,6-diphosphate up to 2 mM enhanced the relative affinity of the enzyme for pyruvate and modified the pyruvate saturation curve from sigmoidal to hyperbolic. The enzyme activity showed also a sigmoidal response to NADH, exhibiting two binding sites for the cofactor with a Hill coefficient of about 1.9. The molecular weight of the native enzyme was 150,000 as determined by gel permeation on Sephacryl S200. Monomers (38,000 daltons) and dimers (85,000 daltons) were observed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis; the latter form was dissociated after reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol, and the enzyme could be considered a tetramer. Antibodies obtained against the purified S. mutans OMZ175 LDH cross-reacted with the sodium dodecyl sulfate-dissociated forms of LDHs from different S. mutans serotypes, Streptococcus sanguis OMZ9, Lactobacillus casei ATCC 4646, and Actinomyces viscosus NY 1. A competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay allowed us to detect a very close relationship between the native states of L-LDHs from S. mutans serotypes and S. sanguis. Cross-reactions were also observed with the LDHs from A. viscosus and L. casei, the latter being the least related. A very weak immunological relationship was obtained between the L-LDH from S. mutans OMZ175 and the D-LDH from Lactobacillus leichmannii, whereas no cross-reaction could be detected with mammal LDHs.
TI  - Reduction of acidurance of streptococcal growth and glycolysis by fluoride and gramicidin.
AB  - The acidurance of glycolysis by intact cells of Streptococcus mutans GS-5, Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 25925, and Streptococcus sanguis NCTC 10904 was found to be highly dependent on membrane functions affected by gramicidin, which increases the proton permeability of cell membranes. Plots of % glucose utilized during two hours against suspension pH values for cells suspended in 100 mM phosphate buffer plus 1 mM MgCl2 plus 13.9 mM glucose indicated, for 50% glucose utilization, pH values of 5.0 for S. mutans, 5.7 for S. salivarius, and 6.2 for S. sanguis. Gramicidin treatment shifted these values to 6.0, 6.3, and 6.9, respectively. Growth of S. mutans and S. salivarius in complex media proved to be more acid-sensitive than was glycolysis, and in batch cultures, there was a well-defined, post-growth phase of glycolysis. Minimum pH values for growth and for glycolysis in medium with excess glucose were approximately 4.8 and 4.4, respectively, for S. mutans, and 4.9 and 4.3 for S. salivarius. S. sanguis was less aciduric and showed little differential acid sensitivity, with minimum pH values of about 5.2 for both growth and glycolysis. Fluoride acted to eliminate the differences in acidurance of growth and glycolysis for S. mutans or S. salivarius and to render both processes more acid-sensitive. Thus, glycolysis was more fluoride-sensitive than was growth. Growth was found to be acid-limited in media with initial glucose levels greater than 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5% (weight/volume) for S. sanguis, S. mutans, and S. salivarius, respectively, and to be glucose-limited at lower levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Effects of oxygen on pyruvate formate-lyase in situ and sugar metabolism of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - The strictly anaerobic metabolism of sugar in strains of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis was studied because deep layers of dental plaque are strictly anaerobic. Galactose-grown cells of these streptococcal strains had higher pyruvate formate-lyase activity than did glucose-grown cells. Among these strains, two strains of S. mutans had a significantly higher pyruvate formate-lyase activity than did the others. This enzyme is extremely sensitive to oxygen, and even in situ the enzyme was inactivated by exposure of the cells to air. Lactate was less than 50% of the total end product of the strictly anaerobic incubation of the galactose-grown cells of S. mutans with excess glucose, and a significant amount of formate, acetate, and ethanol was produced through the catalysis of pyruvate formate-lyase. But the cells exclusively produced lactate when exposed to air for 2 min before the anaerobic incubation. The metabolism of sorbitol by S. mutans was seriously impaired by the exposure of the cells to oxygen, and the metabolic rate was reduced to less than 1/20 of that found under strictly anaerobic conditions because of the inactivation of pyruvate formate-lyase. S. sanguis produced a smaller amount of the volatile products from glucose than did S. mutans because of the low level of pyruvate formate-lyase. However, the pyruvate formate-lyase in situ in S. sanguis was less sensitive to oxygen than was that in S. mutans. Because of this low sensitivity, S. sanguis metabolized glucose more rapidly under aerobic conditions, whereas the rates of the aerobic and anaerobic metabolism of glucose by S. mutans were similar, which suggests that S. mutans rather than S. sanguis can sustain the rapid sugar metabolism in the deep layers of dental plaque.
TI  - Streptococcus-Escherichia coli shuttle vector pSA3 and its use in the cloning of  streptococcal genes.
AB  - A shuttle vector that can replicate in both Streptococcus spp. and Escherichia coli has been constructed by joining the E. coli plasmid pACYC184 (chloramphenicol and tetracycline resistance) to the streptococcal plasmid pGB305 (erythromycin resistance). The resulting chimeric plasmid is designated pSA3 (chloramphenicol, erythromycin, and tetracycline resistance) and has seven unique restriction sites: EcoRI, EcoRV, BamHI, SalI, XbaI, NruI, and SphI. Molecular cloning into the EcoRI or EcoRV site results in inactivation of chloramphenicol resistance, and cloning into the BamHI, SalI, or SphI site results in inactivation of tetracycline resistance in E. coli. pSA3 was transformed and was stable in Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mutans in the presence of erythromycin. We have used pSA3 to construct a library of the S. mutans GS5 genome in E. coli, and expression of surface antigens in this heterologous host has been confirmed with S. mutans antiserum. A previously cloned determinant that specifies streptokinase was subcloned into pSA3, and this recombinant plasmid was stable in the presence of a selective pressure and expressed streptokinase activity in E. coli, S. sanguis (Challis), and S. mutans.

TI  - Relationship of adhesion in vitro and cariogenicity of oral Streptococcus species in germ-free rats.
AB  - Thirty-two strains of Streptococcus spp., of known cariogenicity in the gnotobiotic WAG/RIJ rat, were tested for their in vitro adhesion properties. Computerized image analysis measured percentage coverage by, and clump size of, cells adhering to saliva-coated glass. An analysis of variance revealed significant differences for percentage coverage for the majority of species-pairs. There were fewer significant differences for mean clump size between species-pairs. Within the Strep. mutans group there was a highly-significant difference between Strep. mutans/Strep. cricetus (p less than 0.01) with respect to mean clump size. There was a significant correlation between cariogenicity and percentage coverage (p = 0.05) but not clump size (p = 0.359) for pooled strains of Strep. mitis and Strep. sanguis combined.
TI  - The association between dietary sucrose consumption and microbial population shifts at six oral sites in man.
AB  - Sucrose-related microbial population shifts were evaluated at 6 oral sites in 22  volunteers, who consumed high-sucrose diets for 21 days followed by low-sucrose diets for 21 days. Culturing was performed at 0, 12, 21, 33 and 42 days of the 6-week experiment. Over 50,000 microbial isolates were characterized and analysed. Analysis of initial cultures showed the following site-specific microbial characteristics of the 6 sites evaluated: (1) molar fissures harboured higher levels of Neisseria species and showed the highest facultative-to-anaerobic ratio; (2) molar fissures and cervical buccal sites showed high Streptococcus sanguis levels and total Gram-positive cocci and fewer Gram-negative bacilli; (3) the tongue and saliva gave high concentrations of Streptococcus salivarius and Veillonella sp. Sucrose intake was positively related to concentrations of yeasts and Streptococcus mutans in the molar fissures; Actinomyces viscosus in the mandibular approximal site; Strep. mutans, Veillonella sp. and Lactobacillus sp. in the maxillary approximal site and Strep. salivarius on the tongue and in saliva. Sucrose intake was negatively related to concentrations of Neisseria sp. on the tongue and total Gram-positive bacilli in saliva. A definite ecological effect of sucrose on the oral microflora was confirmed. The high inter-subject and site variations of target bacteria and the generally low magnitude of shifts, however, discourage implementation of microbiological criteria in dietary assessments.
TI  - Infectivity and natural transmission of the bacterium Streptococcus mutans in monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) at different ages.
AB  - Oral inoculation of adolescent monkeys with laboratory strains of Streptococcus mutans resulted in only sporadic implantation. Oral colonization of all strains, except possibly one, was not enhanced by dietary sucrose compared with glucose nor by precleaning of accessible tooth surfaces. Infant animals were more susceptible to implantation by laboratory-maintained strains of Strep. mutans than adolescent or adult animals. This difference was magnified when in-vivo maintained Strep. mutans strains were used. Strep. mutans was readily acquired by uninfected adolescent animals from infected cage mates. Strep. mutans-free adolescent monkeys exhibited significant-salivary IgA and serum-IgG response to Strep. mutans antigen, possibly representing a cross-reaction to indigenous Streptococcus sanguis. Uninfected infant animals showed no salivary or serum response to Strep. mutans. There was no change in salivary IgA antibody to Strep. mutans in adolescent animals after implantation or in recipient animals after acquisition of Strep. mutans.
TI  - Inhibition of [3H]-thymidine uptake in human gingival fibroblasts by extracts from human dental plaque, oral bacteria of the Streptococcus and Actinomyces species.
AB  - Extracts from human dental plaque, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces israelli and Actinomyces odontolyticus inhibited [3H]-thymidine uptake by primary human gingival fibroblast cell lines as previous work has shown in respect of HeLa cells. The results show that a variety of oral bacteria, not usually considered to be periodontal pathogens, elaborate factors that adversely affect fibroblasts.
TI  - The relationship between the number of the bacterium Streptococcus mutans at discrete sites on the dentition of macaque monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) and the subsequent development of dental caries.
AB  - Sixteen consecutively-born monkeys were used in a longitudinal study to determine the changes occurring in the total number of bacteria in the palatal grooves of the upper left first deciduous molar teeth, following the introduction of a sucrose-based diet. The total number of bacteria recovered from the grooves increased significantly following the diet change. Twenty-nine days after the diet change, the number of Streptococcus mutans had increased from a median value of less than 10(2) to approx. 10(7) per groove, and the number of Streptococcus sanguis decreased. These changes in the number of Strep. mutans occurred prior to the detection of dental caries. Grooves that became carious harboured significantly more bacteria and more Strep. mutans than did grooves remaining caries-free six months after the diet change.
TI  - Some factors affecting the diffusion of [14C]-lactate in human dental plaque.
AB  - The apparent diffusion rate, D, of lactate was significantly retarded in dental plaque fluid and a simulated plaque fluid consisting of a chemically-defined solution of salts, amino acids and albumin in phosphate buffer at pH 6.5. Metabolic utilization of lactate in live plaque residue reduced D for lactate into such samples of residue, compared with killed samples. D in plaque residue was lower than in a previous study. Increasing the packing density of killed plaque residue of Streptococcus sanguis cells reduced D. Pre-incubation of plaque residue with sucrose or sucrose + NaF reduced D for lactate. No such relationship was found when Streptococcus mutans was so treated, but D for lactate was lower when the cells were grown in tryptone-soy broth supplemented with 5 per cent sucrose compared with unsupplemented broth. The retardation of lactate increased with an increase in ion-exchange capacity of cation- and anion-exchange Sephadex gel-model systems. Thus, the apparent diffusion coefficient of lactate in dental-plaque residue is influenced by the chemical composition of the plaque aqueous phase, by metabolism of lactate, by plaque tortuosity, sucrose metabolism and ion-exchange interactions.

TI  - Salivary-IgA antibody to glucosyltransferase of oral microbial origin in children.
AB  - Salivary IgA levels were measured in whole saliva of 143 children, 2-48 months of age. The median salivary IgA concentration of children less than 12 months old was 30 micrograms/ml. A significant increase in salivary IgA concentration occurred in children 12 to 17 months old. More than 50 per cent of the population, 36 months of age and older, had Streptococcus mutans (88 per cent biotype I) recoverable from their teeth. Salivary IgA antibody levels were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to glucosyltransferase (GTF) antigen complexes from oral streptococci. Salivary IgA antibody to GTF from Streptococcus sanguis was detected in many children. Over 40 per cent of the 43-48-month-old group had detectable salivary antibody to Strep. sanguis GTF; salivary IgA antibody to Strep. mutans GTF (biotype I) was less frequently detected. Most subjects with salivary antibody to Strep. mutans GTF had antibody to Strep. sanguis GTF but only 23 per cent with salivary antibody to Strep. sanguis GTF had antibody to Strep. mutans GTF. Antibody to Strep. sanguis GTF was infrequently associated with the recovery of Strep. mutans from the teeth.
TI  - The effects of basic and acidic synthetic polypeptides on the adherence of the oral bacteria, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis, to hydroxyapatite.
AB  - Two basic and two acidic synthetic polypeptides that bind strongly to hydroxyapatite at neutral pH were tested to determine their influence on adsorption of two Streptococcus mutans and two Streptococcus sanguis strains to hydroxyapatite. The adsorption of the strains was significantly enhanced or reduced by the basic and acidic agents, respectively. Study of acidic polypeptides provided evidence of competition between the polypeptides and the bacterial cells for hydroxyapatite adsorption sites.
TI  - Longitudinal investigation of bacteriology of human fissure decay: epidemiological studies in molars shortly after eruption.
AB  - In the present investigation, the proportions of Streptococcus mutans, lactobacilli, Streptococcus sanguis, veillonellae, and an unidentified actinomyces-like organism in dental plaque on occlusal fissures of first mandibular molars were monitored at 6-month intervals over a 3-year period in 368 children who were initially in grades 1 or 2. Teeth destined to become decayed exhibited a significant increase in the proportions of S. mutans from 6 to 24 months before the diagnosis of dental decay. Lactobacilli were sporadically detected but when present were associated with dental decay. Children whose teeth exhibited the greatest number of decayed surfaces had, at all time periods, significantly higher proportions of S. mutans than did children who were caries free. Many teeth had high proportions of S. mutans at their entry into the study. About 10% of the monitored teeth erupted during the period of observation, and in these teeth both S. mutans and lactobacilli could be significantly associated with decay. In these newly erupted teeth S. mutans outnumbered lactobacilli by ca. 20 to 1. S. sanguis, veillonellae, and the unidentified actinomyces-like organism could not be associated with the development of decay. These findings strongly implicate S. mutans and possibly lactobacilli as dental pathogens and suggest that if decay is to be controlled by strategies based upon a S. mutans infection, then the various tactics used probably will have to be performed on primary teeth, as these teeth are the most likely sources of infection for the permanent teeth.
TI  - Isolation of a novel protein involved in the transport of fructose by an inducible phosphoenolpyruvate fructose phosphotransferase system in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Fructose transport in Streptococcus mutans LG-1 is mediated by at least two distinct phosphoenolpyruvate fructose phosphotransferase systems. One system is constitutive and consists of membrane components enzyme II as well as enzyme I and heat-stable protein. The other system is inducible and requires, in addition to enzyme I and heat-stable protein, a soluble substrate-specific protein for catalytic activity. This protein factor, designated IIIfru, was purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, molecular sieving on Sephadex G-75, and preparative electrophoresis. The purified preparation showed only one protein band, with a molecular weight of 12,600, on sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, on gel electrophoresis with the discontinuous buffer Tris-glycine, and after electrofocusing in gel (pI congruent to 3.7). The molecular weight of the native protein determined by gel filtration at 4 degrees C was 51,000. Immunodiffusion experiments performed with immunoglobulins prepared against the purified IIIfru from S. mutans LG-1 suggested that other S. mutans strains possessed a IIIfru. No precipitin bands, however, were detected with extracts from S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. lactis, S. faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Lactobacillus casei, and Escherichia coli.
TI  - Characterization and expression of a cloned tetracycline resistance determinant from the chromosome of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - A chromosomal tetracycline resistance (Tcr) determinant previously cloned from Streptococcus mutans into Streptococcus sanguis (Tobian and Macrina, J. Bacteriol. 152:215-222, 1982) was characterized by using restriction endonuclease mapping, deletion analysis, and Southern blot hybridization. Deletion analysis allowed localization of the Tcr determinant to a 2.8-kilobase region of the originally cloned 10.4-kilobase sequence. This cloned determinant hybridized to a representative of the tetM class of streptococcal Tcr determinants but not to representatives of the tetL and tetN classes and, like other tetM determinants, mediated high-level resistance to tetracycline and low-level resistance to minocycline. A portion (approximately 3 kilobases) of the isolated streptococcal fragment was subcloned into Escherichia coli, where it conferred resistance to tetracycline and minocycline. Two proteins with apparent molecular weights of 33,000 and 35,000, encoded by the S. mutans DNA, were synthesized in E. coli minicells. Insertion of DNA into a unique SstI site of the cloned S. mutans fragment resulted in inactivation of Tcr expression in E. coli and S. sanguis, as well as loss of production of both the 33,000- and 35,000-dalton proteins in E. coli minicells. Incubation of minicells in subinhibitory concentrations of tetracycline did not result in changes in the levels of synthesis of either protein. Our data suggest that at least one of these proteins is involved in the expression of Tcr.
TI  - Viridans streptococci in infective endocarditis: species distribution and susceptibility to antibiotics.
AB  - A method for the speciation of viridans streptococci (non-groupable) is described. The major identification criteria are based on the reactions to a series of biochemical tests, including acid production in lactose, inulin, raffinose, mannitol and sorbitol, hydrolysis of arginine, esculin and Na hippurate, and production of polysaccharides in 5% sucrose media. A total of 450 strains was isolated from blood cultures, 183 of which were from confirmed cases of subacute endocarditis. The latter were identified as follows (%): Streptococcus sanguis I (25.7), S. mitis (19.7), S. sanguis II (19.7), S. mutans (17.5), S. milleri (12), S. morbillorium (3.2) and S. salivarius (2.2). Susceptibility to antibiotics was studied for 129 of these strains: 68% were susceptible to all drugs tested, 20% were resistant only to tetracycline, 4% only to penicillin (MIC = 0.5-4 micrograms ml-1) and 8% were multiply resistant (tetracycline, macrolides and related drugs, chloramphenicol, penicillin, high-level resistance to kanamycin and/or streptomycin [MIC = 1000-80.00 micrograms ml-1].
TI  - Genetic exchange between oral streptococci during mixed growth.
AB  - To determine whether oral streptococci might exchange genetic information in the  oral cavity, paired transformable strains of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus milleri were growth together. Chromosomal and plasmid-borne antibiotic resistance markers could be readily transferred from S. mutans GS-5 to S. milleri NCTC 10707 or S. sanguis Challis during mixed growth. However, no exchange from the latter two organisms to strain GS-5 could be detected under these conditions. The transfer of genetic information from S. sanguis to S. milleri was also observed.
TI  - Cell surface proteins of oral streptococci.
AB  - Whole cells of representative strains of oral streptococci (Streptococcus sanguis, S. mitis, and S. salivarius) were radiolabeled by the lactoperoxidase method of radioiodination. The labeled polypeptides obtained by extraction of whole cells with boiling sodium dodecyl sulfate were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Of the total radioactivity, ca. 70% was released by treating whole cells with trypsin, suggesting that the labeling was confined to proteins located on the cell surface. Most S. sanguis strains studied gave a characteristic banding pattern consisting of a high-molecular-weight (120,000 [120K] to 63K) group of six proteins. Three low-molecular-weight (12K, 16K, and 18K) proteins were also detected in many strains.
TI  - Lactose transport in Streptococcus mutans: isolation and characterization of factor IIIlac, a specific protein component of the phosphoenolpyruvate-lactose phosphotransferase system.
AB  - The transport of lactose in Streptococcus mutans is mediated via an inducible phosphoenolpyruvate-lactose phosphotransferase system. This system requires for catalytic activity a membrane fraction (enzyme II), two general proteins called enzyme I and HPr, and a soluble specific protein termed factor IIIlac. This protein factor was purified from S. mutans ATCC 27352 by chromatographies on DEAE-cellulose, hydroxylapatite, Ultrogel AcA 34, and phosphocellulose. The purified protein migrated as a single band with a molecular weight of 10,000 on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and urea. The molecular weight calculated from the amino acid composition was 10,541. Gel filtration of the native protein gave a molecular weight of 41,500. Its isoelectric point was ca. 4.70. A specific antiserum was prepared against purified factor IIIlac. Immunodiffusion experiments revealed that only cellular extracts from lactose-grown cells contained factor IIIlac. A cross-reaction was observed with all of the S. mutans strains tested as well as with Streptococcus sanguis 10556, Streptococcus lactis 11454, and Staphylococcus aureus 6538. No precipitin band was observed with extracts of Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus casei, and Bacillus subtilis.
TI  - Evaluation of a rapid latex agglutination test for identification of group D streptococci.
AB  - The SeroSTAT latex agglutination test (Scott Laboratories, Inc., Fiskesville, R.I.) for identification of group D streptococci was compared with bile-esculin agar and Lancefield grouping by using 110 clinical isolates of group D streptococci (S. faecalis, 74; S. bovis, 24; S. durans, 3; S. faecium, 9) and 65 viridans streptococci (S. anginosus-constellatus, 2; Streptococcus MG, 15; S. sanguis II, 14; S. mitis, 7; S. mutans, 5; S. salivarius, 8; S. sanguis I, 8; S. acidominimus, 1; S. morbillorum, 2; S. pneumoniae, 3). All strains of group D streptococci were bile-esculin positive. SeroSTAT reactions were falsely positive with 2 strains of S. sanguisII and 1 strain of Streptococcus MG (4.6% of all viridans streptococci tested) and falsely negative with 10 S. bovis, 8 S. faecalis, 1 S. durans, and 6 S. faecium strains (22.7% of all group D streptococci tested). When considered with colonial morphology and hemolytic reaction, SeroSTAT is a rapid (60-s) and useful test for recognition of group D streptococci.
TI  - Identification of streptococci in a medical laboratory.
AB  - A total of 965 cultures of streptococci received at a reference unit for identification were examined with API-20 Strep kits and also by established methods. The API method, although it needed to be supplemented with additional tests, largely overcame the difficulty that pyogenic streptococci are usually identified by their serological reactions and that biochemical tests are used for the identification of the other streptococci. Representatives of at least 24 established or possible species were identified.
TI  - Microbiological assessment of dental plaque on bovine enamel implants worn intra-orally in children.
AB  - Nine caries-active children, each from six to nine years old, wore small removable enamel implants intra-orally for four weeks as part of an effort to develop removable model systems for studying dental plaque in fissures. The implants, consisting of two enamel cubes arranged to simulate a fissural space, were cemented in box preparations in stainless steel crowns on pulpotomized primary molars. Upon removal, the fissural spaces were opened to facilitate plaque harvesting. The plaque samples were cultured, and enamel decalcification of the plaque-exposed surfaces was measured. Quantitative microbial values were compared with those of natural fissure plaque samples from both caries-active (CA) and caries-and restoration-free (CF) children, also from six to nine years old. Streptococcus mutans and S. sanguis levels of fissural insert plaque (FI) and natural fissural plaque from (CA) were similar. Both contained higher S. mutans levels than did plaque from (CF). FI harbored higher concentrations of Lactobacillus and Actinomyces species and lower concentrations of Neisseria species. Otherwise, FI plaque resembled natural fissure plaque. Microhardness of FI plaque-exposed enamel decreased significantly compared with pre-experimental values and showed a significant negative correlation with values for total lactobacilli on selective media, and for S. mutans on non-selective media.
TI  - Disseminated tetracycline resistance in oral streptococci: implication of a conjugative transposon.
AB  - A DNA sequence specifying tetracycline resistance (Tcr) has been previously cloned from a clinical isolate of Streptococcus mutans designated U202 (J. A. Tobian and F. L. Macrina, J. Bacteriol. 152:215-222, 1982). We used this sequence as a molecular probe in studying the dissemination of Tcr among oral streptococcal species isolated from patients treated with tetracycline. Eleven strains (including S. sanguis I, S. sanguis II, S. mitis, and S. salivarius) from seven patients were examined by Southern blot analysis. Seven strains showed strong hybridization to the Tcr probe, two showed weak hybridization, and two did not display detectable hybridization. Based on previous characterization of the cloned sequence, our data suggest the dissemination of the tetM class of resistance determinants among these oral streptococci. One of the clinical S. sanguis I isolates studied was able to transfer its Tcr phenotype to other oral streptococci and to enteric streptococci in the absence of plasmid DNA. This transfer appeared to be conjugation-like on the basis of its insensitivity to DNase and its dependence on intimate cell-to-cell contact. Using the cloned Tcr sequence, we were able to study the progeny of the matings. Our data suggest that this resistance transfer element occupies a chromosomal location in streptococcal cells and that it strongly resembles the conjugative transposon Tn916 in its behavior.
TI  - Carbohydrate composition of dental plaque from primates with irradiation caries.
AB  - Carbohydrate analyses were performed on dental plaque collected from the teeth of irradiated monkeys, non-irradiated monkeys and a group of Streptococcus mutans free animals, all of which were fed the same standard cariogenic diet. Glucose was the predominant sugar constituent in plaque and was detected in highest concentration in the irradiated animals. Small amounts of pentoses and other hexoses were also present. Plaque from irradiated animals contained, by comparison with the other groups, higher levels of Strep. mutans and lower levels of Streptococcus sanguis and Actinomyces.
TI  - Reaction of human colostral and early milk antibodies with oral streptococci.
AB  - Colostrum or early breast milk or both from each of 16 healthy women contained agglutinating antibodies for all normal streptococcal inhabitants of the human oral cavity (S. mutans, S. sanguis, S. mitis, and S. salivarius), including those which colonize the neonatal oral cavity in significant numbers. Agglutination correlated with the amount of immunoglobulin A (IgA) binding to bacterial surfaces as measured by mixed reverse passive antiglobulin hemagglutination. Surprisingly, colostral IgA agglutinated our control organism, Brucella abortus. Low levels of colostral or milk IgM and IgG antibodies also reacted with all of the test bacteria. Absorption studies with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that a proportion of antibodies in colostrum and early milk is specific for each of the different oral streptococci. Fractionation on Sepharose 4B indicated that 11S secretory IgA is the predominant form of colostral and milk antibody for all of the test bacteria, including B. abortus. No evidence was found that reactions other than antigen-antibody reactions resulted in binding of colostral immunoglobulins by any of the test bacteria.
TI  - Adherence of oral streptococci: evidence for nonspecific adsorption to saliva-coated hydroxylapatite surfaces.
AB  - It is proposed that binding of oral streptococci to saliva-coated hydroxylapatite (SHA) surfaces is a multifactorial process involving both specific and nonspecific receptors. In this context, specific binding is described as a high-affinity, saturable interaction between the cell and binding surface. Conversely, nonspecific binding is considered to be a nonsaturable, generalized, low-affinity reaction. Experimental differentiation of specific binding from nonspecific binding was achieved with a competition assay which utilized a large excess of nonradiolabeled bacteria to compete with the 3H-labeled cells for attachment to receptors on 1.5 mg of SHA crystals. Competition assays of Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mitis adhesion clearly demonstrated that the total binding isotherm was composed of a saturable specific binding reaction and a minor nonspecific binding component. This was further substantiated by analysis of nonlinear Scatchard plots of the total binding data. The competition data for Streptococcus mutans binding indicated that ca. 50% of the S. mutans binding appeared to be specific, although saturation of the SHA surfaces with bacterial cells could not be demonstrated. Experiments measuring desorption of radiolabeled cells from SHA crystals into buffer showed that ca. 50% of the bound S. mutans cells were removed after 4 h, whereas less than 5% of the S. sanguis cells were eluted from the SHA surfaces. The kinetics of attachment were studied by using an extract of Persea americana as a noncompetitive inhibitor of adherence. The total cell binding data for these experiments suggested a very rapid binding reaction followed by a slower rate of attachment. It was concluded from these three different experimental approaches that adherence of selected oral streptococci to SHA surfaces involves specific, high-affinity and nonspecific, low-affinity binding reactions. The concept is developed that in vitro streptococcal attachment to SHA can be described as a two-reaction process in which the low-affinity interaction of the cell with the SHA surface precedes the establishment of the stronger, specific bonds needed for the maintenance of streptococci in the oral cavity.
TI  - Growth of oral Streptococcus species and Actinomyces viscosus in human saliva.
AB  - Microorganisms in dental plaque live in constant association with saliva. The role of saliva in the adherence of bacteria to the teeth and the antibacterial properties of saliva have been well investigated; less interest has been shown in the possible role of saliva as a substrate for oral microorganisms. In this study it was shown that saliva can serve as a growth medium for oral Streptococcus spp. and Actinomyces viscosus. The cell production of these organisms on saliva was carbohydrate limited. The doubling times for growth on glucose-supplemented saliva (4 to 5 mmol/liter) ranged from 1.6 to 4.0 h. The availability of carbohydrate sources for the oral microflora is discussed in relation to microbial growth in the oral cavity.

AB  - This study assesses the abilities of S. mutans GS5 and BHT and S. sanguis G9B to  produce subsurface lesions on smooth surfaces of extracted human teeth and examines factors which might be responsible for any differences encountered. Teeth were incubated in Brain Heart Infusion broth containing 2% sucrose and a pure culture of the organism to be tested, the media being changed each day for eight days. Surface and media pH's were measured. The mineral content of both the surface enamel and the subsurface lesions was determined by contact microradiography. Significantly deeper and more demineralized lesions were produced by GS5 than by either BHT or G9B. GS5 also produced a lower surface and medium pH and a more dense coating on the teeth. Similar results were obtained with GS5 and G9B when the BHI broth was replaced with FMC synthetic media. It is concluded that the system described is suitable for studying cariogenic potential and will be useful in measuring the anticariogenicity of suspected therapeutic agents.
TI  - The conditioning role of saliva in streptococcal attachment to hydroxyapatite surfaces.
AB  - The solution properties of saliva and its role in conditioning both the substrate and the bacterial surface have been investigated with regard to the attachment of oral streptococci to hydroxyapatite surfaces. Saliva from eight subjects was used and the attachment of three organisms, Streptococcus mutans strains FA-1 (serotype b) and KPSK2 (serotype c) and S. sanguis T175-1, was studied. An adsorbed salivary layer on a hydroxyapatite surface substantially reduced the affinity of the organisms for the surface. Adsorbed saliva on the bacterial surfaces, however, tended to increase the organisms' affinity for saliva-coated apatite. The source of saliva was important in determining the extent of inhibition of attachment. The data indicated that the negatively charged and hydrophilic nature of salivary conditioning films was important in controlling bacterial adsorption to hydroxyapatite. The results also suggested that hydrophobic salivas could promote binding of the more hydrophobic bacteria known to be early colonizers of the teeth.

AB  - A-16686, a new glycoproteide antibiotic obtained from fermentation of an Actinoplanes strain, is active against Gram-positive aerobic and anaerobic bacteria; MIC values ranged from 0.016 to 2.0 micrograms/ml. A-16686 is bactericidal for growing cells of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, S. faecium, S. mutans, S. mitis and S. sanguis. There is no cross-resistance with clinically used antibiotics. A-16686, administered subcutaneously, is very effective in experimental S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae septicemias in the mouse.
TI  - Sucrase and maltase activities in supragingival dental plaque in humans of streptococcal, actinomyces and lactobacilli species.
AB  - 20 reference strains and 72 isolated strains from dental plaque of streptococci,  actinomyces, and lactobacilli species were examined for sucrase and maltase activities. The type of sucrase in the different strains was determined by use of the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, acarbose. The enzyme activities were determined as formation of monosaccharide, and quantitated spectrophotometrically. Although variations occurred in enzyme activities between reference and isolated strains, the same general pattern was noticed. Strains of Streptococcus mutans and S. salivarius showed regularly the highest sucrase activities, followed by strains of Actinomyces viscosus and A. naeslundii. Most lactobacilli belonged to the bacteria with low sucrase activity like S. sanguis and S. mitior. In some lactobacilli strains, however, a high sucrase activity was observed. The level of sucrase activity in S. mutans strains was dependent on biotype/serotype, as strains of biotype V/serotype e showed high activities, biotypes I and IV corresponding to serotypes c, f, and d showed intermediate activity, and biotype III/serotype a always showed low activity. In most of the strains the sucrases were composed of enzymes with specificity against both alpha-glucosidic linkage and beta-fructosidic linkage of the sucrose molecule, but in varying ratios. In all species, exept S. sanguis and S. mitior, lower maltase than sucrase activity was observed, but even in the two species mentioned the maltase activities were relatively low. On the basis of observations of selected reference strains in every species examined both sucrases and maltases are to some extent inducible.

TI  - A conceptual model for the co-existence of Streptococcus spp. and Actinomyces spp. in dental plaque.
AB  - One of the most important questions in ecology is how to explain the co-existence of the variety of physiologically related organisms in the same habitat. A model is presented for the co-existence of Streptococcus species and Actinomyces species in dental plaque. The hypothesis is that these organisms co-exist because they simultaneously utilize several carbon and energy substrates. The hypothesis follows from the observation that the growth yield of oral streptococci and actinomyces in saliva is limited by carbohydrate. Preliminary experiments were undertaken to test the hypothesis using mixed chemostat cultures and gnotobiotic rats. Competition between S. mutans K1R and A. viscosus Ut2 in mixed chemostat cultures on glucose and asparagine was hampered by the early appearance of high-glucose-affinity variants of A. viscosus. From the physiological characteristics of S. sanguis and S. milleri, it might be predicted that simultaneous utilization of carbohydrate and arginine would enable these organisms to co-exist with S. mutans in an ecosystem. To test this mechanism under natural conditions, germ-free rats were inoculated with a combination of S. mutans K1R and S. sanguis P4A7 or the combination S. mutans K1R and S. milleri B448. The rats were fed on three different diets: (1) 58% cornstarch; (2) 48% cornstarch and 10% sucrose; and (3) 53% cornstarch and 5% arginine. The results of this experiment demonstrated that dietary arginine caused a significant decrease of the ratios K1R/P4A7 and K1R/B448 in dental plaque.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Regulation of glucose metabolism in oral streptococci through independent pathways of glucose 6-phosphate and glucose 1-phosphate formation.
AB  - In vivo rates of glucose uptake and acid production by oral streptococci grown in glucose- or nitrogen-limited continuous culture and batch culture were compared with the glucose phosphorylation activities of harvested, decryptified cells. The strains examined contained significant phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphotransferase system (PTS) activity, measured by a glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) dehydrogenase-linked assay procedure, but this activity was insufficient to account for the in vivo glucose uptake rates. However, ATP was a superior phosphoryl donor to phosphoenolpyruvate, and unlike the PTS, phosphoryl transfer with ATP was insensitive to bacteriostatic concentrations of chlorhexidine, suggesting glucokinase-mediated G6P formation. Again, G6P formation from the PTS and glucokinase reactions was not commensurate with some of the glucose uptake rates observed, implying that other phosphorylation reactions must be occurring. Two novel reactions involving carbamyl phosphate and acetyl phosphate were identified in some of the strains. No G6P formation was detected with these potential phosphoryl donors, but in the presence of phosphoglucomutase, glucose 1-phosphate (G1P) formation was evident, which was insensitive to chlorhexidine. G1P is a precursor of glycogen, and good correlation was obtained between G1P formation activity and endogenous metabolism of washed cells measured either as a rate of acid production at a constant pH 7 or as a decrease in pH with time in the absence of titrant. A "league table" of abilities to synthesize G1P and produce acid from endogenous metabolism was compiled for oral streptococci grown in batch culture. This indicated that Streptococcus mutans Ingbritt and Streptococcus sanguis Challis were unable to form G1P or produce much acid endogenously, whereas increasing activities were obtained with Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus mitis. In particular, S. mitis had the highest G1P formation activities and was able to decrease the pH to less than 5 in 15 min by endogenous metabolism alone. The data are consistent with the intracellular accumulation of free glucose driven by proton motive force when PTS activities are low and the subsequent phosphorylation to either G6P for metabolism via glycolysis or G1P for glycogen biosynthesis. The accumulation of acetyl phosphate during glucose-limited growth and the availability of arginine for catabolism to carbamyl phosphate provide an explanation as to why some glucose-limited oral streptococci continue to synthesize glycogen under these conditions, which might prevail in plaque.
TI  - Peptide utilization by oral streptococci.
AB  - Streptococcus mitis ATCC 903 and Streptococcus sanguis 804 could utilize large peptides present in proteose peptone as their sole source of nitrogen but grew poorly in amino acid medium. By contrast, Streptococcus mutans BHT and S. mutans IB grew in amino acid medium but could not utilize large peptides. Streptococcus sp. strain Bravato had requirements for both peptides and amino acids. Peptide size did not seem important for the utilization of peptides by S. mitis except that dipeptides were not utilized. Large peptides were essential for depressed hyaluronidase synthesis in nongrowing S. mitis. Intracellular aminopeptidase activities were high in S. mitis ATCC 903 and Streptococcus sp. strain Bravato, intermediate in S. sanguis 804, and low in S. mutans BHT and S. mutans IB.
TI  - Physical and genetic analyses of streptococcal plasmid pAM beta 1 and cloning of  its replication region.
AB  - Plasmid pAM beta 1, originally isolated from Streptococcus faecalis DS5, mediates resistance to the MLS (macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B alpha) group of antibiotics. A restriction endonuclease map of the 26.5-kilobase (kb) pAM beta 1 molecule was constructed by using the enzymes AvaI, HpaII, EcoRI, PvuII, Kpn1, BstEII, HpaI, HhaI, and HindIII. A comparison of this map to those of four independently isolated deletion derivatives of pAM beta 1 located the MLS resistance determinant within a 2-kb DNA segment and at least one conjugative function within an 8-kb region. The 5.0-kb EcoRI-B fragment from pAM beta 1 was ligated onto the 4.0-kb Escherichia coli plasmid vector, pACKC1, and used to transform E. coli HB101. The 9.0-kb chimeric plasmid was then used to transform Streptococcus sanguis Challis with concurrent expression of the E. coli kanamycin resistance determinant. The 5.0-kb EcoRI-B fragment from pAM beta 1 was subsequently used as a vector to clone a streptomycin resistance determinant from a strain of Streptococcus mutans containing no detectable plasmid DNA. Subcloning experiments, using a HindIII partial digest of pAM beta 1 DNA, narrowed the replication region of this plasmid to a 2.95-kb fragment.
TI  - Inhibition of bacterial aggregation by serum- and blood-derived proteins.
AB  - Human and animal sera contain potent inhibitors of saliva-mediated aggregation of oral streptococci. The inhibitors consist of a high-molecular-weight heat-labile factor and a lower-molecular-weight heat-activated factor. The latter appears to be serum albumin. Analyses of purified blood-derived proteins indicated that several high-molecular-weight proteins (fibrinogen, fibronectin, and ferritin) were able to inhibit aggregation at low concentrations. These data suggest that high-molecular-weight proteins may modulate the aggregation process.
TI  - In-vivo dental plaque-forming ability and relative cariogenicity of the bacteria  Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus sanguis I and II in mono-infected gnotobiotic rats.
AB  - Sixteen strains of Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguis I and Strep. sanguis II were tested for cariogenic potential and in-vivo plaque-forming ability in a gnotobiotic WAG/RIJ rat test system. All strains produced far less fissure plaque in vivo than strains of Streptococcus milleri or Streptococcus mutans. There was less extracellular matrix around cells of Strep. mitis or Strep. sanguis than around Strep. mutans, in the fissures. Dense sheets of cells were observed only with Strep. mutans. Some localized colonization of exposed smooth surfaces occurred with most strains. Strep. mitis produced no caries in three tests, low-caries scores in two tests and high-caries scores in one test. A single strain of Strep. mitis produced a highly-cariogenic variant able to ferment raffinose. Strep. sanguis I induced low-levels of caries in 12 tests; one test of NCTC 7865 produced moderate levels of caries, and another test of 311 produced no caries. Strep. sanguis 311 was dextran-negative. Strep. sanguis II strains induced no caries in three tests, low caries scores in six tests and moderate levels of caries with Strep. sanguis 402. No strain of Strep. mitis or Strep. sanguis was able to induce smooth-surface lesions.
TI  - Partial chemical characterization and biological activities of sulphated glycoproteins isolated from in-vivo pilocarpine-stimulated secretions of rat minor salivary glands.
AB  - Following the incorporation of [35S]-sulphate into rats, 35S-labelled sulphated glycoproteins were isolated from the minor salivary gland secretions of pilocarpine-stimulated, immobilized animals. The secretory products were initially resolved on Sepharose 4B into two major radioactive fractions, one of which appeared at the void volume and represented only 7 per cent by weight of the applied fraction. The bulk of the products were of lower molecular weight and were further resolved by DEAE-Sephacel anion-exchange chromatography. Four distinct radioactive fractions were obtained all of which possessed blood-group A reactivity and aggregated Streptococcus sanguis NCTC 7864 but not Streptococcus mutans OMZ61. The radioactive fractions possessed protein/carbohydrate ratios in the range 1.6:1-5.8:1. Ester-sulphate contents ranged from 2.5 to 5.3 per cent with a higher value of 14.0 per cent being obtained for the most anionic fraction. Sialic acid was in the range 5.1 to 21.6 per cent. None of the fractions tested contained sulphated glycosaminoglycans.
TI  - Growth and acid tolerance of human dental plaque bacteria.
AB  - Pure cultures of representative strains of cariogenic and non-cariogenic plaque bacteria were assessed for their ability to initiate and maintain growth in broths, adjusted to initial pH levels of 7.0, 5.5 or 5.0, and to produce lactic acid from sucrose or glucose in resting-cell suspensions at pH 6.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0. Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus casei and Streptococcus faecalis showed greater acid tolerance than strains of Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitis and Actinomyces viscosus. For all species, growth initiation in broth was more acid sensitive than lactic-acid production in resting-cell suspensions. These data confirm and extend previous observations that the species of plaque bacteria most closely associated with the initiation or progression of dental caries are more aciduric than non-cariogenic species.

TI  - Ability of various oral bacteria to bind human plasma fibronectin.
AB  - The present study describes the ability of various oral bacteria to bind human plasma fibronectin (PFN). Avid binding of 125I-PFN was found for Streptococcus mutans (serotypes a to h), Streptococcus sanguis, group A Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus, while other gram-positive bacterial species tested demonstrated only weak or negligible PFN binding ability. Two gram-negative bacterial species, Bacteroides gingivalis and Escherichia coli, did not significantly bind PFN. 125I-PFN binding to S. mutans 6715 cells was decreased by pretreatment with unlabeled PFN, and the radiolabeled PFN bound to the cell surface was released on addition of unlabeled PFN. Strong inhibition of 125I-PFN binding to S. mutans 6715 cells was obtained by protease pretreatment, while partial inhibition was also observed following treatment with acid, alkali, lipase, and monoclonal anti-polyglycerophosphate. These results suggest that PFN binding to S. mutans cells is reversible and that PFN receptors on the cell surface appear to be heat-stable multiple proteins.
TI  - Adherence of oral bacteria to chemically modified hydroxyapatite.
AB  
TI  - Evidence that glucose and sucrose uptake in oral streptococcal bacteria involves  independent phosphotransferase and proton-motive force-mediated mechanisms.
AB  - Sugar transport and glycolysis in Streptococcus sanguis NCTC 7865, Streptococcus  mitis ATCC 903, Streptococcus salivarius NCTC 8606 and several strains of Streptococcus mutans were investigated by following the rate of acid production by washed bacteria at a constant pH of 7.0. The phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphotransferase system (PTS) was inhibited by low concentrations of chlorhexidine. When this PTS-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine was added to cells washed and re-suspended in KCl, glucose uptake and glycolysis continued at a greatly-reduced rate. Chlorhexidine abolished glucose and sucrose uptake and metabolism in bacteria washed and incubated in saline. The Na+-inhibition was reproduced in KCl-washed bacteria using the cyclic peptide ionophores, valinomycin and gramicidin, to dissipate K+ and H+ gradients across the cell membrane. Glucose metabolism by Strep. mutans B13 was more resistant to chlorhexidine than that of Strep. mutans NCTC 10449 or Strep. sanguis but was more sensitive to the ionophores. Valinomycin had a greater inhibitory effect on strain B13 than the other two. That ion gradients are important in the chlorhexidine-resistant glucose-uptake mechanism was confirmed using the classical uncoupling agents, carbonylcyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone, 2,4-dinitrophenol and KSCN. Glucose metabolism was inhibited in the presence of both the uncouplers and the PTS-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine and significant inhibition was also observed in the absence of the PTS inhibitor. Lactate or the ATPase inhibitor, dicyclohexyl carbodiimide (DCCD), had similar inhibitory effects on the non-PTS uptake system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Characterization of a monoclonal antibody specific for lipoteichoic acid from various gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - A hybrid cell line, 3G6, producing monoclonal antibody (mAb) against the polyglycerophosphate (PGP) backbone of lipoteichoic acids has been derived by the polyethylene glycol-induced fusion of mouse myeloma cells and spleen cells from mice immunized with partially purified glucosyltransferase from culture supernatant of Streptococcus mutans strain 6715. Immunodiffusion tests and ELISA revealed that the antibody reacted with purified PGP from group A Streptococcus pyogenes strain Sv as well as crude phenol-water and saline extracts of various gram-positive bacteria except for a few species such as biotype B S. sanguis, Micrococcus sp., and Actinomyces viscosus. Whole cells of serotype b S. mutans and Staphylococcus epidermidis were agglutinated upon addition of 3G6 mAb, while those of most other species were not significantly affected by this procedure. A hapten inhibition study showed that glycerophosphate was only a potent inhibitor of passive hemagglutination reactions between LTA coated sheep erythrocytes and 3G6 mAb.

TI  - Protoplast and cytoplasmic membrane preparations from Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Protoplasts were prepared from Streptococcus sanguis and some S. mutans serotypes by use of lysozyme (EC 3.2.1.17) under particular conditions: cells had to be grown in DL-threonine (20 mM) and harvested in early exponential phase. The efficiency of protoplast formation was enhanced by two additional steps: plasmolysis (in 12% PEG), prior to addition of lysozyme, and a swirling phase, after the enzymic action. This procedure allowed us to obtain clean protoplasts, with only 0.5% contamination by bacterial cell walls. Up to 90% protoplast lysis was obtained in 0.5 M-NaCl. Cytoplasmic membrane purification was achieved by centrifugation on a glycerol cushion.
TI  - Effects of local immunization of hamsters with glucosyltransferase antigens on infection with Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - The effects of immunization with antigens of the Streptococcus mutans glucosyltransferase (GTF) complex on oral challenge with two Streptococcus sanguis strains (H7PR3 and 34) in hamsters were studied. Antisera to S. mutans GTF complex were able to inhibit one-third (strain H7PR3) to one-half (strain 34) of the S. sanguis GTF activity which could be inhibited when these S. sanguis GTFs were incubated with antisera to S. sanguis GTF. Washed, intact cells of strains H7PR3 and 34 were able to remove a significant amount of enzyme inhibitory activity and immunoglobulin G antibody activity from antisera to S. mutans GTF. These results established the existence of an antigenic relationship between S. sanguis and S. mutans GTFs. The effect of injection of S. mutans strain 6715 GTF or phosphate-buffered saline, incorporated into complete Freund adjuvant, on oral challenge with S. sanguis was compared in 243 hamsters in nine experiments. Salivary and serum GTF inhibitory activity was present in all GTF-injected animals before challenge. After a 2- or 3-day challenge with S. sanguis H7PR3 (seven experiments) or 34 (two experiments), fewer bacteria were recovered from GTF-injected hamsters in every experiment. Significant differences were observed in six of the nine experiments. During the 7- to 21-day period after challenge, 33% of the phosphate-buffered saline-injected sham group (group I) still had S. sanguis recoverable from the molar surfaces, whereas only 19% of the S. mutans GTF-injected group (group II) remained infected with S. sanguis (P less than 0.01). These results suggest that immunization with GTF from S. mutans may influence the colonization potential of S. sanguis in the oral cavity.
TI  - Comparative hydrophobicities of oral bacteria and their adherence to salivary pellicles.
AB  - Oral bacteria were found to differ in their surface hydrophobicities as determined by their ability to adsorb to hexadecane. Strains of Actinomyces viscosus, A. naeslundii, Streptococcus sanguis, S. mitis, and Bacteroides gingivalis proved highly hydrophobic. Strains of B. intermedius, S. salivarius, S. mutans, and B. melaninogenicus were less hydrophobic, whereas strains of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were hydrophilic. An overall correlation was noted between the adsorption of bacteria to hexadecane and their numbers which attached to experimental salivary pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite surfaces. This suggests that hydrophobic bonding plays an important role in this process. Pellicles prepared from saliva which had been extracted with chloroform-methanol to remove lipids adsorbed comparable numbers of S. sanguis and A. viscosus and increased numbers of S. mutans. Analyses of adsorption isotherms indicated that pellicles formed from lipid-depleted saliva contained increased numbers of binding sites for the S. mutans strains studied, and this likely accounts for their enhanced adsorption. Absorption of saliva with 10% octyl or phenyl Sepharose reduced the protein content of saliva by almost half, but the numbers of bacteria which attached to pellicles prepared from such absorbed saliva were similar to or higher than those which attached to control pellicles. These observations suggest that saliva does not contain unique highly hydrophobic salivary macromolecules which serve as essential pellicle receptors for the bacteria studied. The data obtained are consistent with the view that hydrophobic bonding together with interactions between complementary molecules are involved in bacterial attachment to salivary pellicles on teeth.
TI  - Comparative growth responses of oral streptococci on mixed saliva or the separate submandibular and parotid secretions from caries-active and caries-free individuals.
AB  - Growth of S. mutans on mixed or parotid saliva from CF individuals may be influenced by the availability of growth-supportive proteins or the inhibitory activity present in parotid saliva. A deficiency in growth-supportive proteins may explain the limited growth of S. sanguis on mixed or submandibular saliva from these individuals.
TI  - Further studies on the growth inhibition of some oral bacteria by xylitol.
AB  - The growth in Brain Heart Infusion medium containing glucose or sucrose of Streptococcus mutans strain OMZ 176, two strains of Strep. sanguis (ATCC 10556 and No. 39) and Actinomyces viscosus type ATCC 27044 was inhibited by xylitol but not by D-arabitol or ribitol. When fructose was substituted for glucose, xylitol had no growth-inhibiting effect. It was also shown that the bacteria produced less acid in the presence of xylitol, as measured by the pH of the cultures or by neutralization with alkali.
TI  - Streptococci isolated from the bloodstream and gingival crevice of man.
AB  - One hundred and twenty six strains of streptococci isolated from the bloodstreams of 123 hospital in-patients--55 with endocarditis--and 255 strains isolated from the gingival crevices of 66 volunteers were characterised. Species isolated were Streptococcus mitior, S. sanguis, undifferentiated viridans streptococci, S. salivarius, S. milleri, S. mutans, S. bovis and S. faecalis. There was no significant difference between the distribution of species in blood and in the gingival crevice. S. mitior and S. sanguis were found less frequently in blood than their presence in the gingival crevice would have suggested, whereas S. milleri was found more frequently. This may indicate that S. milleri is more invasive or that it enters the bloodstream from sources other than the gingival crevice.
TI  - Prevalence of viridans streptococci exhibiting lactose-inhibitable coaggregation  with oral actinomycetes.
AB  - Fresh oral isolates from human dental plaque were selected on the basis of their  spherical morphology. In a double-blind experiment, their species identity and ability to coaggregate with human oral Actinomyces viscosus and Actinomyces naeslundii were determined. Of the 110 isolates characterized, 30 were identified as either Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus anginosus-constellatus, or Veillonella parvula; none of these coaggregated with the actinomycetes. The remaining 80 isolates were identified as Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus MG-intermedius, or Streptococcus morbillorum. Of these 49 isolates (61%) coaggregated with actinomycetes, and nearly 90% (43 of 49 isolates) exhibited lactose-inhibitable coaggregations. Compared with previously characterized coaggregation properties determined with stock culture strains of streptococci, 82% of the fresh isolates exhibited identical coaggregations. The other 18% made up a new coaggregation group that possessed a related lactose-inhibitable coaggregation pattern. Thus, most fresh isolates that coaggregated exhibited lactose-inhibitable coaggregations with human oral actinomycetes. It is suggested that these coaggregations are mediated by a network of lectin-carbohydrate interactions similar to those already characterized in previous studies with stock cultures of actinomycetes and streptococci.
TI  - Interaction of human plasma fibronectin with cariogenic and non-cariogenic oral streptococci.
AB  - The interaction of purified human plasma fibronectin (Fn) with bacteria was studied with a variety of oral streptococci. Each of the strains of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus mitis tested was aggregated by Fn to various degrees, depending on the concentration of Fn added to the test mixtures. Binding assays performed with radiolabeled Fn and various strains of streptococci demonstrated various capabilities to bind Fn, and the amount of Fn bound by each strain was paralleled by its Fn-induced aggregation, with S. mutans 6715 giving the highest values in both assays. Because of the avid binding of Fn by certain strains of potentially cariogenic streptococci, we investigated the possibility that Fn may be present in human saliva and may be adsorbed from saliva onto artificial tooth pellicles. Immunoreactive Fn was detected in paraffin-stimulated whole saliva by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays of saliva adsorbed onto gelatin-coated cuvettes and by immunoelectroblots (Western blots) of salivary components separated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide slab gels. Furthermore, immunoreactive Fn was found to be present in artificial tooth pellicles formed by incubating hydroxyapatite beads with whole human saliva. These results demonstrate that certain strains of oral streptococci bind to and are aggregated by Fn. The presence of Fn in artificial tooth pellicles suggests that this macromolecule may play a role in the attachment of potentially cariogenic and other oral streptococci to dental tissues.
TI  - Copper-inhibition of the growth of oral streptococci and actinomyces.
AB  - Copper ions were found to inhibit the rate of growth in broth culture of Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarious, Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus and Actinomyces naeslundii. In all cases, 10(-3) M copper inhibited the rate of growth, whereas 10(-4) M and lower concentrations had little or no effect. At the concentrations used in mouthwashes one mode of action of copper ions is to reduce the rate of growth of oral bacteria in vitro.
TI  - Modulation of bacterial aggregation by PMN and platelet extracts.
AB  - Human parotid saliva contains agglutinins which bind to the surface of streptococci and induce the formation of bacterial aggregates. Bacterial aggregation can be blocked by proteins released from viable PMNs and platelets or by sonic extracts prepared from these cells. PMN and platelet inhibitors display characteristic differences in molecular weight, protease, and temperature sensitivity. The mechanism of action of the inhibitors appears to involve a direct interaction with the salivary agglutinins rather than with the bacteria. It is thus possible that PMN and platelet-derived products might modulate saliva-mediated bacterial aggregation and thereby influence the course of infections in the oral cavity.
TI  - Common antigens of streptococcal and nonstreptococcal oral bacteria: characterization of wall-associated protein and comparison with extracellular protein antigen.
AB  - A soluble wall-associated common protein (WAP) has been isolated from cell wall-extracted antigens of exponentially growing cells of Streptococcus sanguis OMZ9, two serotypes (a and e), of Streptococcus mutans and Actinomyces viscosus OMZ104. The WAP antigens from the different strains were obtained by chromatography on an anti-rabbit immunoglobulin column of sodium dodecyl sulfate-dissociated immunoprecipitates. The affinity-isolated WAP antigens from the different oral bacteria were identical, as demonstrated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (showing an apparent molecular weight of 80,000) and amino acid and sugar compositions. This WAP antigen, common to all bacterial strains tested, consisted of 90% protein and 10% sugar. A comparison of the chemical properties of this WAP antigen and of the soluble extracellular common protein antigen showed that, although having similar amino acid and sugar compositions, the two proteins are different. Electron micrographs developed after immunocytological labeling of the WAP antigen on whole cells confirmed that it is located on the cell wall.
TI  - Trimethylsilyl-sugar profiles of Streptococcus milleri and Streptococcus mitis.
AB  - Seventy strains of 'viridans-group' streptococci were analysed gas chromatographically after preparation of trimethylsilyl ethers of their cellular sugars. The resulting profiles were evaluated as a possible aid to taxonomy. Glycerol, glucose, galactose, N-acetyl-glucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid were found in all strains, in varying amounts. Rhamnose was the major neutral sugar in most strains, other than representatives of Streptococcus mitis, which invariably had ribose and usually anhydroribitol but no rhamnose. One strain of Strep. mitis possessed arabitol. Some strains of Strep. mitis and 'Strep. milleri' were alone in containing N-acetylgalactosamine. A combination of N-acetylgalactosamine and rhamnose in the absence of ribose was diagnostic for strains of 'Strep. milleri'.
TI  - Coaggregation of human oral Cytophaga species and Actinomyces israelii.
AB  - A total of 19 strains of oral Cytophaga sp. obtained from subgingival plaque deposits were tested for their ability to coaggregate with strains of Actinomyces israelii, A. viscosus, A. naeslundii, Streptococcus sanguis, S. mutans, S. salivarius, and S. mitis. Coaggregation was observed only with A. israelii. Based on their coaggregation patterns with eight A. israelii strains, the Cytophaga strains were distributed among three distinct groups: those that coaggregated with A. israelii PK16 but not with A. israelii W1011 (ATCC 29322), those that coaggregated with A. israelii ATCC 29322 but not with A. israelii PK16, and those that coaggregated with none of the eight A. israelii strains. In each of the coaggregations, prior heat treatment (85 degrees C, 30 min) of the Cytophaga cells prevented coaggregation, whereas identical treatment of the A. israelii cells had no effect. The ability of A. israelii PK16 to form adherent plaque on a tooth surface previously coated with Cytophaga plaque was tested with one of the coaggregating Cytophaga strains. White patches of A. israelii plaque were found covering both the amber-colored Cytophaga plaque on the cementum surface as well as the enamel surface to which Cytophaga strains do not adhere. Electron micrographs of thin-sectioned mixed-plaque material revealed both cell types in close proximity. In addition, electron micrographs of negatively stained coaggregated cells showed interbacterial adherence between surface fimbrae on A. israelii and outer membrane blebs on the gram-negative Cytophaga sp. The kinetics of binding of A. israelii to spheroidal hydroxyapatite and to root powder were indicative of a high-affinity binding system with comparatively large numbers of available binding sites on both substrata. These results indicate the highly specific nature of Cytophaga sp.--A. israelii recognition. The contribution of such recognition toward the mechanisms that are responsible for the indigenous nature of these oral bacteria is discussed.
TI  - Effects of mecillinam and cefoxitin on growth, macromolecular synthesis, and penicillin-binding proteins in a variety of streptococci.
AB  - Although some strains of streptococci seem to be virtually inert to mecillinam, the growth of other strains, notably certain viridans streptococci (Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis) was inhibited by relatively low concentrations of the drug. Inhibition of the synthesis of peptidoglycan, RNA, protein, and DNA in two tolerant strains, S. mutans FA-1 and GS-5, was studied over a wide range of concentrations of mecillinam, benzylpenicillin, and cefoxitin. The responses of both strains to all three beta-lactams were very similar; that is, synthesis of insoluble peptidoglycan was most susceptible. Inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis was followed rapidly and sequentially by substantial but less severe inhibitions of RNA and protein synthesis. Significant inhibition of DNA synthesis was not observed. Binding studies with [14C]benzylpenicillin alone or after preexposure of membrane preparations to benzylpenicillin, mecillinam, or cefoxitin suggest that reasonably selective binding of a beta-lactam antibiotic to one or two of the major penicillin-binding proteins (PBP 1 or PBP 4) of S. mutans GS-5 and FA-1 may be the initial step in the series of events that results in the inhibition of growth and in the inhibition of insoluble peptidoglycan assembly and of RNA and protein synthesis.
TI  - Hydrogen peroxide excretion by oral streptococci and effect of lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate-hydrogen peroxide.
AB  - Approved type strains of Streptococcus sanguis, S. mitis, S. mutans, and S. salivarius were grown under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The rate of hydrogen peroxide excretion, oxygen uptake, and acid production from glucose by washed-cell suspensions of these strains were studied, and the levels of enzymes in cell-free extracts which reduced oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, or hypothiocyanite (OSCN-) in the presence of NADH or NADPH were assayed. The effects of lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate-hydrogen peroxide on the rate of acid production and oxygen uptake by intact cells, the activity of glycolytic enzymes in cell-free extracts, and the levels of intracellular glycolytic intermediates were also studied. All strains consumed oxygen in the presence of glucose. S. sanguis, S. mitis, and anaerobically grown S. mutans excreted hydrogen peroxide. There was higher NADH oxidase and NADH peroxidase activity in aerobically grown cells than in anaerobically grown cells. NADPH oxidase activity was low in all species. Acid production, oxygen uptake, and, consequently, hydrogen peroxide excretion were inhibited in all the strains by lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate-hydrogen peroxide. S. sanguis and S. mitis had a higher capacity than S. mutans and S. salivarius to recover from this inhibition. Higher activity in the former strains of an NADH-OSCN oxidoreductase, which converted OSCN- into thiocyanate, explained this difference. The change in levels of intracellular glycolytic intermediates after inhibition of glycolysis by OSCN- and the actual activity of glycolytic enzymes in cell-free extracts in the presence of OSCN- indicated that the primary target of OSCN- in the glycolytic pathway was glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.
TI  - Hydrophobicity and adherence of oral streptococci after repeated subculture in vitro.
AB  - Fresh isolates of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus  salivarius from human dental plaque were all highly hydrophobic. After repeated subculture in vitro on blood agar, strains of S. mutans serotype c showed decreased hydrophobicity, whereas serotype d/g strains did not. Parallel to the decreased hydrophobicity in the serotype c strains, an impaired ability to adhere to hydroxyapatite was observed. A similar but less pronounced decrease in hydrophobicity in one S. sanguis strain resulted in a marked decrease in adherence to hydroxyapatite.

AB  
TI  - Effect of SnF2, administered as mouthrinses or topically applied, on Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis and lactobacilli in dental plaque and saliva.
AB  - Mouthrinsing with SnF2 reduced the Streptococcus mutans population in plaque and  saliva and the proportion of Streptococcus sanguis in plaque. The effect was of short duration: 2 weeks after treatment the values of S. mutans in plaque and saliva were even higher than the pretreatment values. Topical SnF2 applications reduced the S. mutants population in plaque and saliva but did not reduce the proportion of S. sanguis in plaque. The effect was more prolonged : 4 weeks after treatment the S. mutans population in interproximal plaque remained significantly reduced and the salivary levels of the organism had not fully returned to pretreatment levels. Both SnF2 treatments significantly increased the salivary levels of lactobacilli. The values of lactobacilli in saliva remained significantly increased 4 weeks after the SnF2 mouthrinsing but had almost returned to pretreatment levels within 2 weeks after the topical SnF2 applications. The findings suggest that the cariogenic potential of dental plaque is differently affected depending on whether a drug is administered as a mouthrinse or is applied topically.
TI  - Application of a competition model to the growth of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis in binary continuous culture.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans 6715-15 and Streptococcus sanguis 10558 were grown together  in continuous culture with glucose as the limiting carbon source. The relationship of growth rate to substrate concentration was determined for pure cultures of each organism in continuous and batch cultures. A model based on competition for a growth-limiting substrate (glucose) was used to predict the proportions of each organism when grown in binary cultures. The results indicate that interactions other than competition for glucose carbon exist between S. mutans and S. sanguis grown under these conditions.
TI  - Methylation of mercury from dental amalgam and mercuric chloride by oral streptococci in vitro.
AB  - The capacity of the oral bacteria Streptococcus mitior, S. mutans and S. sanguis  to methylate mercury was investigated in vitro. Mercuric chloride and pulverized dental amalgam in distilled water, respectively, were used as sources of mercury. Methylmercury was found in the bacterial cells of all three tested strains. The results indicate that organic mercury compounds may be formed in the oral cavity.
TI  - ADP-like platelet aggregation activity generated by viridans streptococci incubated with exogenous ATP.
AB  - To explore the possibility that Streptococcus sanguis aggregation of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) might be mediated by soluble agents, we tested cell-free S. sanguis supernatant for aggregation activity. The supernatant of untreated S. sanguis was without measurable PRP aggregation activity. In contrast, the cell-free supernatant of ATP-incubated S. sanguis produced an immediate wave of PRP aggregation. The supernatant with PRP aggregating activity contained insufficient protease to produce a response. The response increased with the time of incubation with ATP. Active supernatant was desalted and chromatographed on nucleotide-calibrated columns of Dowex 1-X8. An active ADP function was identified. The activity was insensitive to dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, but was sensitive to both Ca2+ and Ca2+-Mg2+ chelating agents, cold (4 degrees C), heat (80 degrees C), pH (optimum between pH 7 and 8), apyrase, and sodium molybdate. In addition, preincubation of PRP with adenosine inhibited activity. Strains of viridans streptococci were screened for activity. Aggregation-promoting strains showed two times more activity than did other strains. Although it was not vigorously excluded that the ADP was discharged from the microbes, the existence of an exogenous ATPase on S. sanguis was strongly suggested. The expression of the activity was associated with the lag time to onset of PRP aggregation with intact S. sanguis. This activity could, therefore, be a synergistic promoter of PRP aggregation and an additional virulence factor in endocarditis.
TI  - In vitro antiplaque activity of octenidine dihydrochloride (WIN 41464-2) against  preformed plaques of selected oral plaque-forming microorganisms.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of octenidine dihydrochloride (WIN 41464-2) against intact preformed in vitro plaques of four indigenous oral plaque-forming microorganisms, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus, and Actinomyces naeslundii, was studied. Both absolute (plaque bactericidal index) and relative (chlorhexidine coefficient) indices of antiplaque efficacy were established. Octenidine dihydrochloride compared favorably with chlorhexidine digluconate with respect to overall antiplaque potency in this in vitro plaque bactericidal model. These data indicate that prudent selection of treatment concentration and duration and frequency of exposure should provide an effective means to aid in controlling dental caries and Actinomyces-associated disease in vivo.
TI  - Cysteine toxicity for oral streptococci and effect of branched-chain amino acids.
AB  - Cysteine was bactericidal to strains of Streptococcus mutans and S. salivarius in concentrations that were nontoxic to S. sanguis, S. milleri, or S. mitior when these microorganisms were incubated in a saliva protein-based synthetic medium. Cysteine toxicity for S. mutans also occurred after incubation in synthetic base medium supplemented with amino acids as the nitrogen source for growth. The bactericidal effect of cysteine for S. mutans or S. salivarius in the saliva protein medium was influenced by the cysteine oxidative activity associated with the saliva protein fraction. Valine alone or in combination with leucine or isoleucine was effective in overcoming cysteine toxicity for susceptible strains of S. mutans or S. salivarius. Cysteine toxicity for these oral streptococci may be due to cysteine inhibition of an enzymatic step in the valine-leucine biosynthetic pathway.
TI  - Purification and properties of pyruvate kinase from Streptococcus sanguis and activator specificity of pyruvate kinase from oral streptococci.
AB  - It was found that pyruvate kinases with two different regulatory characteristics  were distributed among oral streptococci. The pyruvate kinases of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, and Streptococcus bovis were activated by glucose 6-phosphate, whereas the enzymes of both Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mitis were activated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. Pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) from S. sanguis NCTC 10904 was purified, giving a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme had a molecular weight of 250,000 to 260,000 and consisted of four identical subunits. Whereas the pyruvate kinase from S. mutans was completely dependent on glucose 6-phosphate (K. Abbe and T. Yamada, J. Bacteriol. 149:299-305, 1982), the enzyme from S. sanguis was activated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. In the presence of 0.5 mM fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, the saturation curves for the substrates, phosphoenolpyruvate and ADP, were hyperbolic, and the Km values were 0.13 and 0.30 mM, respectively. Without fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, however, saturation curves for both substrates were sigmoidal. GDP, IDP, and UDP could replace ADP. Like the enzyme from S. mutans, the enzyme from S. sanguis required a divalent cation, Mg2+ or Mn2+, and a monovalent cation, K+ or NH4+, for activity, and it was strongly inhibited by Pi. When the concentration of Pi was increased, the half-saturating concentration and Hill coefficient for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate increased. The remarkable fluctuation of intracellular levels of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate observed in the cells growing under glucose limitation and nitrogen limitation implies that the intracellular concentration of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, in cooperation with that of Pi, may regulate pyruvate kinase activity in S. sanguis in vivo.

TI  - Numerical taxonomy of Streptococcus.
AB  - A numerical taxonomic study of strains of Streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. The major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (S. faecalis, S. faecium, 'S. avium' and a proposed new species 'S. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (S. bovis, S. equinus, S. salivarius, 'S. casseliflavus', S. mutans, S. raffinolactis and an unidentified Oral Group I); (c) lactic species group (S. lactis including S. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (S. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (S. mitis, S. sanguis, a proposed new species 'S. oralis' and 'S. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, S. equi, 'S. equisimilis' including 'S. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of Lancefield Group B strains of human origin); (g) parapyogenic species group (S. uberis, 'S. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of Lancefield Groups R, S and T). Species of Aerococcus, Gemella, Leuconostoc and Pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.
TI  - [Characterization of the antigen in circulating immune complexes and application  to the detection of streptococcal antigens in human infectious endocarditis].
AB  - Immune complexes from patients with subacute endocarditis were used to develop a  methodology for characterization of the antigen involved in human circulating immune complexes. This model was chosen because it permits isolation of the causative agent of the streptococcal infection thought to contain the antigen present in the immune complex. A comparison was made between two methods for characterization of bacterial antigen bound to antibody. In the first, animals were immunized with purified immune complexes and the production of antistreptococcal antibodies was investigated. In the second method, a sandwich ELISA was developed, implying the double specificity of the immune complex (human immunoglobulin and streptococcal antigen). The latter method gave the best results, detecting antigen in the immune complexes of 8 out of 10 patients' sera. The application of this method to other immunopathological situations is discussed.
TI  - Aggregation of human platelets and adhesion of Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - Platelet vegetations or thrombi are common findings in subacute bacterial endocarditis. We investigated the hypothesis that human platelets selectively bind or adhere strains of Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mutans and aggregate, as a result, into an in vitro thrombus. Earlier ultrastructural studies suggested that aggregation of platelets over time by Staphylococcus aureus was preceded in order by adhesion and platelet activation. We uncoupled the adhesion step from activation and aggregation in our studies by incubating streptococci with platelet ghosts in a simple, quantitative assay. Adhesion was shown to be mediated by protease-sensitive components on the streptococci and platelet ghosts rather than cell surface carbohydrates or dextrans, plasma components, or divalent cations. The same streptococci were also studied by standard aggregometry techniques. Platelet-rich plasma was activated and aggregated by certain isolates of S. sanguis. Platelet ghosts bound the same strains selectively under Ca2+- and plasma-depleted conditions. Fresh platelets could activate after washing, but Ca2+ had to be restored. Aggregation required fresh platelets in Ca2+-restored plasma and was inducible by washed streptococcal cell walls. These reactions in the binding and aggregometry assays were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Surface microfibrils on intact S. sanguis were identified. These appendages appeared to bind S. sanguis to platelets. The selectivity of adhesion of the various S. sanguis strains to platelet ghosts or Ca2+- and plasma-depleted fresh washed platelets was similar for all donors. Thus, the platelet binding site was expressed widely in the population and was unlikely to be an artifact of membrane aging or preparation. Since selective adhesion of S. sanguis to platelets was apparently required for aggregation, it is suggested that functionally defined receptors for ligands on certain strains of S. sanguis may be present on human platelets. Some differences in the selectivity and rate of the aggregation response were noted among platelet donors, although the meaning of the variability requires further study. Nonetheless, these interactions may contribute to platelet accretion in the initiation and development of vegetative lesions in the subacute bacterial endocarditis.
TI  - Production, purification, and properties of a bacteriocin from Staphylococcus aureus isolated from saliva.
AB  - Staphylococci from samples of human saliva were isolated on staphylococcal-selective agar plates. These strains were tested for the inhibition of the growth of Staphylococcus aureus FDA209P. The frequency of inhibitory strains among all of the staphylococcal isolates was 5.2%. Strain IYS2, which formed the biggest inhibitory zone against the growth of the indicator strain, was used as the producer of bacteriocin. IYS2 was identified to be S. aureus, based on its biological properties. The bacteriocin was purified by sequential procedures, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, fractionation with ethanol, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. Its molecular weight was determined to be 5,000. The isoelectric point was 10.0. In amino acid composition, lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, valine, and phenylalanine were predominant. The bacteriocin was heat stable but inactivated by proteases or peptidase. The bacteriocin had a bactericidal effect on susceptible cells. An analysis of the inhibitory spectrum among typical oral indigenous bacteria showed that Streptococcus salivarius, Propionibacterium acnes, Corynebacterium parvulum, and Actinomyces israelii were susceptible to the bacteriocin. Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces naeslundii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacterionema matruchotii, and Bacteroides melaninogenicus were resistant. The majority of S. aureus tested were susceptible, and all Staphylococcus epidermidis strains tested were resistant.
TI  - Influence of growth conditions on adherence of Streptococcus mutans ingbritt to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans Ingbritt grown under standardized conditions adhered less effectively to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads than did Streptococcus sanguis G9B, and there was competition for binding. The results with Ingbritt were influenced by the generation time, the pH of growth, and the carbohydrate source as shown by studies on organisms grown in continuous culture.
TI  - The binding of human salivary alpha-amylase by oral strains of streptococcal bacteria.
AB  - The ability of various oral streptococci to bind salivary alpha-amylase to their  cell surfaces was investigated. Samples of cells were mixed with whole cleared saliva and the alpha-amylase remaining after removal of the cells was assayed by radial diffusion in starch-containing agarose. Seventy-five per cent of Streptococcus sanguis strains bound the enzyme but strains of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus mitior did not. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis of Strep. sanguis cells which had been mixed with saliva showed that alpha-amylase is bound to the surface of the cells and can be recovered from them intact. The ability of Strep. sanguis strains to bind the enzyme did not correlate with biotype, IPS production or ability to adhere to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite. The cell-surface receptor responsible for the binding of alpha-amylase to Strep. sanguis (NCTC 7865) is a heat-stable component, possibly protein in nature, which is closely associated with the cell wall.
TI  - Heterofermentative glucose metabolism by glucose transport-impaired mutants of oral streptococcal bacteria during growth in batch culture.
AB  - Spontaneous mutants defective in a membrane component of the phosphoenolpyruvate-glucose phosphotransferase system were isolated by plating cells of Streptococcus sanguis 10556, Streptococcus mutans GS5-2 and NCTC 10449 on agar containing lactose and 2-deoxyglucose. Toluenized cells of these mutants were defective in their ability to catalyse the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose. The parental strains were mainly homofermentative when grown in batch culture in the presence of various sugars. Nevertheless, the mutants produced acetate, formate and ethanol when cultured in the presence of glucose but were homofermentative when grown in the presence of lactose or maltose. Analysis of one mutant isolated from Strep. sanguis (mutant GS26) revealed normal levels of glucokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, puruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. This last enzyme was dependent on fructose 1,6-diphosphate for catalytic activity. The determination of the intracellular level of fructose 1,6-diphosphate (FDP) during growth of the cells in batch culture showed that the mutant strains contained 2 to 15 times less FDP than the parental strains. Growth experiments performed at pH 6.0 and 7.0 with Strep. sanguis and its PTS-negative mutant GS26 suggested that the regulation of pyruvate metabolism in this bacterium include the intracellular level of FDP and the initial hydrogen concentration of the growth medium. The results also suggested that, in these bacteria, an active PTS is required to maintain the intracellular concentration of FDP high enough to keep the cell homofermentative during growth in batch culture.

TI  - Predominant cultivable microflora of plaque on removable dentures in patients with healthy oral mucosa.
AB  - Plaque from the fitting surface of upper full dentures in eight patients with healthy palatal mucosa was studied. To characterize the predominant cultivable flora, 916 isolates (100-128 from each sample) were subcultured from anaerobic roll-tubes. Streptococci constituted 0-81 per cent (median, 41 per cent) of the isolates with varying proportions of Streptococcus milleri, Streptoccus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitior and Streptococcus sanguis. Staphylococcus aureus made up 0-13 per cent (median, 6 per cent). Gram-positive rods constituted 1-74 per cent (median, 33 per cent). Among these, Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces viscosus and Actinomyces odontolyticus were the most common species, whereas lactobacilli were isolated only from two samples, constituting 21 and 48 per cent. Among Gram-negative bacteria, only Veillonella parvula was common, constituting 3-20 per cent (median, 10 per cent). Gram-negative rods were isolated only from three samples in small proportions making up 0-6 per cent (median, 0 per cent) of the flora. Forty-seven isolates (5 per cent) were lost. Cultures for yeasts on Sabouraud agar were positive for five samples and the yeast counts corresponded to 0-0.45 per cent (median, 0.002 per cent) of the total viable counts. The microflora of denture plaque is highly variable and is to a large extent similar to that of some forms of dental plaque.
TI  - Inhibition by the antimicrobial agent chlorhexidine of acid production and sugar  transport in oral streptococcal bacteria.
AB  - Oral streptococci transport sugars via the phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphotransferase (PEP-PTS) system. In a specific assay of this system, low concentrations of chlorhexidine abolished the activity of the glucose and sucrose PTS in batch-grown cells of Streptococcus mutans Ingbritt and B13, Strep. sanguis NCTC 7865, Strep. mitis ATCC 903, Strep. milleri NCTC 10709 and Strep. salivarius NCTC 8606. Intact cells and cells made permeable to the assay reagents with toluene were used. Toluenized cells were more sensitive to chlorhexidine than intact cells (0.09 and 0.25 mM, respectively). This PTS-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine reduced acid production from glucose in pH fall experiments to values higher than are obtained solely from endogenous metabolism. The effect of chlorhexidine on rates of acid production was determined at pH 7.0 using cells washed with either 135 mM NaCl or 135 mM KCl. In general, faster rates of acid production from the metabolism of glucose and sucrose were obtained with potassium-treated cells. Addition of the PTS-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine markedly reduced or totally abolished acid production by NaCl-treated cells; a greater residual-activity was detected in the same cells washed with KCl (except with Strep. mutans B13 and Strep. mitis ATCC 903). The PTS-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine had little or no effect on the viability of cells. The results confirm the existence of sugar uptake systems in oral streptococci additional to the PTS and provide an explanation for the additive anti-caries effect of mouth-rinses containing both fluoride and chlorhexidine.
TI  - Effect of insertion of osseo-integrated prosthesis on the oral microflora.
AB  - Ten patients undergoing treatment with bridges supported by osseo-integrated oral titanium implants were studied regarding the oral microflora. Saliva samples for microbiological studies were collected before the abutment operation, 1 week after the operation, after the bridges were inserted and again 52 weeks after the abutment operation. The implants did not induce colonization with "plaque streptococci" such as Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis. A marked colonization with potentially pathogenic microorganisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas species and enterobacteria was observed after the abutment operation. This was probably due to the use of surgical dressing.
TI  - An in-vitro study of the role of sucrose and interactions between oral bacteria in possible mechanisms of dental plaque formation.
AB  - The adherence of streptococci to hydroxyapatite spheroids (HAS) depended upon the strain used, the fermentable carbon source available during bacterial growth, the number of times a clinical isolate had been subcultured on laboratory media and the pre-treatment of the HAS. Sucrose greatly stimulated the secondary colonization of Streptococcus mutans strain 3209 on HAS pre-equilibrated with this strain, but no similar effect was observed with glucose. Pre-equilibration of HAS with Streptococcus sanguis 7865 inhibited rather than enhanced subsequent colonization by Strep. mutans strain 3209 in the presence of sucrose.
TI  - Inhibition by acarbose, nojirimycin and 1-deoxynojirimycin of glucosyltransferase produced by oral streptococci.
AB  - Acarbose is known to inhibit glucoamylase, maltase and sucrase. Our aim was to test whether it would also inhibit glucosyltransferase (GTF), to determine the type of inhibition and to compare the inhibitor potency of acarbose with that of nojirimycin and deoxynojirimycin, two other glucosidase inhibitors. Enzyme inhibition was measured either by chemical assay or by incorporation of radioactivity into product. Acarbose effectively inhibited the synthesis of polysaccharide by GTF from strains of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis, but not by fructosyltransferase from Streptococcus salivarius. Acarbose and 1-deoxynojirimycin were more potent inhibitors of GTF than maltose, nojirimycin or various amino sugars. The mechanism of action of these compounds is consistent with competitive inhibition.
TI  - Degradation of the microbial and salivary components participating in human dental plaque formation by proteases elaborated by plaque bacteria.
AB  - Twenty-eight strains of facultative, Gram-positive, sporulating bacilli which produce caseinolytic enzymes were isolated from human early dental plaque. A major component of the extracellular caseinolytic enzymes elaborated by strong producers seemed to be neutral zinc proteases. The extracellular proteases inactivated glucosyltransferase of Streptococcus mutans and inhibited the synthesis of adherent glucans from sucrose. The enzymes also degraded the Strep. mutans cell-surface receptor for dextran and glucan, the receptor for salivary agglutinins, located on Streptococcus sanguis cells, and the surface component of Actinomyces viscosus cells involved in co-agglutination with Strep. sanguis cells. The enzymes hydrolysed human whole saliva proteins, which seemed to result in loss of the ability to agglutinate Strep. sanguis cells.
TI  - An improved method for measuring aggregation of certain streptococcal bacteria found in dental plaque.
AB  - Various cells were incubated with either dextran or sucrose and the reaction was  terminated by the addition of a 20 per cent solution of formaldehyde. A reaction mixture consisting of cells and aggregated cells was applied to a step-gradient glycerol column (0-60 per cent) and 0.5 ml fractions were collected from the bottom of the column. Non-aggregated cells remained in the top layer of the column. Aggregated cells settled in the 30 per cent glycerol layer as determined by either spectrophotometric or radioactive methods. The amount of aggregated cells demonstrated in this layer increased with either incubation time or concentration of sucrose, dextran or cells. Cells of Strep, mutans strains 6715, AHT, 10449, OMZ-176, OMZ-175 and two mutants of Strep. mutans strain 6715 (designated C4 and C307) aggregated strongly. Cells of Strep. mutans strain LM7 aggregated weakly, whereas cells of Strep. mutans 6715 mutant UAB165, a mutant defective in aggregation. Strep. mutans strain BHT, Strep. salivarius and Strep. sanguis did not aggregate in the presence of either sucrose or dextran. Experiments testing co-aggregation between two different types of cells were done by using 3H-labelled and 14C-labelled cells. Strep. mutans strain 6715 co-aggregated with Strep. sanguis in the presence of sucrose or dextran, whereas Strep. mutans strain 6715 did not aggregate with Strep. salivarius. The method separates aggregated from non-aggregated cells and enables quantitation of sucrose- or dextran-induced aggregation and co-aggregation.
TI  - Enhanced saliva-mediated bacterial aggregation and decreased bacterial adhesion in caries-resistant versus caries-susceptible individuals.
AB  - A study of saliva-mediated aggregation and adhesion has been carried out in a group of caries-resistant (CR) and caries-susceptible (CS) individuals. The submandibular saliva of the CS group had a much greater potency, as determined by dilution, in promoting adherence to hydroxyapatite beads than did the saliva of CR group. In contrast, the CR group demonstrated a twofold enhancement of saliva-mediated aggregation compared with the CS group. These observations support the hypothesis that saliva-mediated aggregation and adherence are important factors in caries resistance.
TI  - Adherence of Streptococcus sanguis to salivary mucin bound to glass.
AB  - This study demonstrated that human submandibular-sublingual saliva (HSMSL) provided a better substrate than did whole saliva or parotid saliva for the binding of Streptococcus sanguis in a glass adherence assay. Additional evidence indicated that the lower molecular weight salivary mucin in HSMSL was involved in these interactions. Mucin's sialic acid residues were found to play a major role in mediating the binding of certain strains of Streptococcus sanguis.

TI  - Helper plasmid cloning in Streptococcus sanguis: cloning of a tetracycline resistance determinant from the Streptococcus mutans chromosome.
AB  - A model system for testing the helper plasmid cloning system of Gryczan et al. (Mol. Gen. Genet. 177:459-467, 1980) was devised for the Streptococcus sanguis (Challis) host-vector system. In this system, linearized pVA736 plasmid efficiently transformed an S. sanguis (Challis) host containing a homologous plasmid, pVA380-1, but did not transform a plasmidless host or a host containing a nonhomologous plasmid, pVA380. In addition, whereas monomeric circular pVA736 transformed a plasmidless host with two-hit kinetics, it transformed a pVA380-1-containing host with one-hit kinetics. This helper plasmid cloning system was used to isolate two HindIII fragments (5.0 megadaltons [Mdal] and 1.9 Mdal in size) from the chromosome of Streptococcus mutans V825 which conferred high-level tetracycline resistance. One tetracycline-resistant clone was examined and found to contain three plasmids which were sized and designated pVA868 (9.0 Mdal), pVA869 (9.5 Mdal), and pVA870 (9.8 Mdal). Results of Southern blot hybridization and restriction endonuclease digestion confirmed that all three chimeras were composed of two HindIII fragments of the S. mutans V825 chromosome, as well as a large portion, varying in size for each chimera, of the 2.8 Mdal cloning vector, pVA380-1. Incompatibility observed between pVA380-1 and each of the chimeras indicated that replication of the chimeras was governed by the pVA380-1 replicative origin. Southern blotting experiments revealed that the chimeras hybridized to Tn916, providing the first evidence that transposon-related genes of enteric streptococcal origin are disseminated among oral streptococci.
TI  - [Viridans streptococci in human infections: identification and susceptibility to  antibiotics].
AB  - A method for the speciation of viridans streptococci (devoided of group antigens) is described. The major identification criteria are based on the reaction of a series of biochemical tests such as acid production in lactose, inuline, raffinose, mannitol and sorbitol, hydrolysis of arginine, esculin and Na hippurate, and production of polysaccharides in 5% sucrose media. A total of 460 strains were isolated from human specimens and identified as follows: 118 Streptococcus mitis, 102 S. sanguis II, 75 S. Sanguis I, 87 S. milleri (Streptococcus MG-intermedius), 28 S. mutans, 25 S. salivarius, 14 S. morbillorium, 2 S. uberis and 9 unspeciated. Susceptibility to antibiotics was studied for 318 strains: 63% of them were susceptible to all drugs tested; 37% of the strains were resistant to one or several antibiotics as follows: 34% to tetracycline, 8.5% to macrolides and related drugs, 5.3% to streptomycin and/or kanamycin (MIC greater than 2,000 micrograms/ml), 5% to penicillin (MIC = 1-4 micrograms/ml) and 4% to chloramphenicol.
TI  - Common antigens of streptococcal and non-streptococcal oral bacteria: isolation and biochemical characterization of the extracellular protein antigen.
AB  - An extracellular soluble common protein (ECP) has been purified from extracellular soluble fractions of exponential phase cultures of Streptococcus sanguis OMZ9, of a representative strain of each of Bratthall's seven serological groups of Streptococcus mutans, and of one strain each of Lactobacillus salivarius and Actinomyces viscosus. The ECP antigens from the different strains were prepared from SDS-dissociated immunoprecipitates by affinity chromatography on an anti-rabbit immunoglobulin column. The identity of such purified ECP antigens was demonstrated by their behaviour in immunodiffusion analysis, in SDS-PAGE, in which an identical molecular weight (60000) was found, and by virtue of their similar amino acid and sugar compositions. This common antigen (ECP) consisted of 90% protein and 10% sugar.
TI  - The acquisition of Streptococcus mutans by infant monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) and its relationship to the initiation of dental caries.
AB  - The acquisition and transmission of Streptococcus mutans by 16 consecutively born infant monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) was studied. The 16 infant monkeys were weaned in four groups and caged together to form a commune. Transmission from mother to infant occurred infrequently. Streptococcus mutans was isolated from nine of the mothers but only from the dental plaque of two infant monkeys at weaning at which time the predominant streptococci were S. sanguis and S. mitior. One further animal was colonized by S. mutants during the formation of the commune, but only after it was caged with an infant harbouring the same organism. For 46 d after the completion of the commune, the monkeys were fed a starch-based diet during which time S. mutans of serotypes c, e or h were isolated from the faeces of all 16 animals and from the dental plaque taken from the developmental groove of the first deciduous molar of 11 animals. Faecal transmission appeared to be an important factor in the spread of S. mutans between monkeys in the commune. The monkeys were then fed a caries-promoting high sucrose diet resulting in a rapid increase in the proportion of S. mutans in the plaque and in the faeces. Streptococcus mutans serotype e was more frequently isolated from both plaque and faeces and its predominance may in part be due to the production of a bacteriocin active in vitro against S. mutans serotype h and other species of oral streptococci isolated from monkey dental plaque. The proportion of S. mutans in the developmental groove 8 d after the introduction of the high sucrose diet was significantly related to both the caries status of the groove and the total caries score 6 months later. The results suggest that, in this model of human dental caries, S. mutans is the major bacterial factor in the initiation of tooth decay.
TI  - Growth inhibition of oral streptococci in saliva by anionic proteins from two caries-free individuals.
AB  - Mixed saliva from two caries-free individuals possessed antimicrobial activity toward Streptococcus mutans and S. sanguis. This inhibitory activity was attributed to the presence of a group of four anionic proteins each of which strongly inhibited the growth of the oral streptococci in a saliva protein-based medium but not in a medium containing amino acids as a nitrogen source. These proteins, with isoelectric points of 4.70, 4.90, 4.98, and 5.05, respectively, neither reacted with antisera to immunoglobulin A, G, or M nor appeared to be functionally related to a number of salivary peroxidases, lactoferrin, or lysozyme. On this basis, they may represent a previously unreported group of growth-inhibitory antimicrobial factors occurring in the saliva of some individuals.
TI  - Streptococcus mutans in plaque and saliva after mouthrinsing with SnF2.
AB  - Mouthrinses with SnF2 in 11 subjects significantly reduced (P less than 0.01) the total colony forming units (CFU) count and the numbers of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis in plaque. The numbers of S. mutans and S. sanguis were significantly more reduced than was the total CFU count. After rinsing with SnF2S. sanguis was present in 97% and S. mutans in only 42% of plaque samples from tooth surfaces where they were detected after rinsing with water. SnF2 also significantly reduced (P less than 0.01) the number of S. mutans in saliva. Mouthrinses with NaF did not markedly affect the number of S. mutans either in plaque or in saliva.
TI  - Inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis by soluble bacterial products.
AB  - BACTERIAL-NEUTROPHIL INTERACTIONS may be critical determinants of virulence in periodontal diseases. This study was undertaken to examine the ability of major bacterial species from the human oral cavity to inhibit (1) peripheral blood neutrophil chemotaxis, (2) chemotactic formylmethionyl peptide binding, and (3) phagocytosis. Included were cultured supernatants and sonic extracts obtained from strains of Capnocytophaga, Bacteroides gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides asaccharolyticus, Capnocytophaga species, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Neisseria, Actinomyces viscosus, Bacterionema matruchotii, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus sanguis. Chemotaxis was measured using Boyden chambers; phagocytosis was determined using Staphylococcus aureus as the indicator organism and radioactive chemotactic peptide binding was assessed by a rapid filtration assay. None of the test organisms were cytotoxic to neutrophils or inhibited neutrophil phagocytosis. Capnocytophaga species., Bacteroides species., A. actinomycetemcomitans, and F. nucleatum produced factors which specifically inhibited neutrophil chemotaxis. Activity was lost after dialysis. Extracts of Bacteroides species, A. actinomycetemcomitans and F. nucleatum, which were not chemotactic by themselves, inhibited binding of chemotactic peptide suggesting that in vitro chemotaxis inhibition was mediated by nonchemotactic components that compete for the chemotactic factor receptor on the neutrophil. The exception was Capnocytophaga which appeared to inhibit chemotaxis by inhibition of a post-binding event. Such chemotactic inhibitors from periodontopathic organisms that inhibit neutrophil function may be important determinants of virulence.
TI  - Effect of streptococcal cell wall components on bone metabolism in vitro.
AB  - Cell was components from Streptococcus mutans NCTC 10449 and Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10558 stimulated the release of 45Ca from prelabeled mouse calvariae in organ culture. Bone resorbing activity was not blocked by fetal calf serum. It was, however, blocked by calcitonin, an inhibitor of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. Indomethacin, a prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor, partially blocked endogenous but not antigen-stimulated 45Ca, suggesting that antigen-stimulated bone resorption was not mediated by prostaglandins. The antigen preparations also had an inhibitory effect on the incorporation of 3H-proline and 3H-thymidine into explants of rabbit and rat calvariae, respectively. The inhibitory effect of antigen on 3H-proline incorporation was not altered by the presence of calcitonin, which suggests that it represented a real inhibition of protein synthesis and not a reflection that the bones were resorbing. These findings indicate that plaque bacterial antigens may contribute directly to the progressive loss of alveolar bone during periodontal disease. The assumption that only Gram-negative organisms play an important role In the etiology of periodontal disease appears incorrect.
TI  - Predominant cultivable microflora of human dental fissure plaque.
AB  - Plaque developed in 10 occlusal fissures from unerupted third molars during implantation for 200 to 270 days in lower molars of dental students was studied. To characterize the predominant cultivable flora, 592 isolates (51 to 67 from each fissure) were subcultured from anaerobic roll tubes. Twenty-eight of the isolates were lost. Streptococci constituted 8 to 86% (median, 45%) of the isolates, Streptococcus mutans constituted 0 to 86% (median, 25%) and S. sanguis constituted 0 to 15% (median, 1%). A few isolates of "S. mitior" and "S. milleri" were found, but no S. salivarius. Staphylococci made up 0 to 23% (median, 9%). Gram-positive rods constituted 6 to 59% (median, 35%). Of these, 0 to 46% (median, 18%) were Actinomyces naeslundii and A. viscosus, but no anaerobic actinomyces were isolated. Arachnia and propionibacteria made up small proportions, lactobacilli were isolated from two fissures, constituting 10 and 29%, and eubacteria were isolated from one fissure (27%). Gram-negative cocci made up 0 to 46% (media, 4%). Only two isolates of gram-negative rods were found, both facultative anaerobes. Although 8 of the 10 fissures had large proportions of S. mutans, lactobacilli, or both, no caries was found even with microradiography. The large individual variation probably reflects differences in initial colonization from saliva and in growth conditions in each fissure.
TI  - Effect of mechanical and chemical plaque control measures on oral microflora in schoolchildren.
AB  - The incidence of S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. mutans, total streptococci and lactobacilli was examined in highly caries active 13-14-year-old schoolchildren participating in a prophylactic program. After 1 year of trial, professional toothcleaning once every second week markedly reduced the frequency of gingivitis and the caries increment. Bimonthly topical applications of a 0.5% chlorhexidine gel with or without subsequent rinsing with 2% NFP had no effect on plaque score and gingivitis but tended to reduce the caries activity. No significant changes were found in the groups with regard to the salivary number of total streptococci and S. sanguis. A reduction of the population of S. salivarius, S. mutans and lactobacilli was observed in the chlorhexidine group. In the group where chlorhexidine was combined with MFP, only S. mutans was reduced.
TI  - Effect of penicillin on Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis and lactobacilli in hamsters and in man.
AB  - The effect of penicillin on the number of oral Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis and lactobacilli in hamsters and in man was investigated. This is of interest as S. mutans and lactobacilli are involved in the carious process while S. sanguis is not. Hamsters infected with both S. mutans and S. sanguis or only S. sanguis received penicillin in their drinking water for 14 d. The treatment reduced the proportion of S. mutans and S. sanguis in dental plaque to undetectable levels. After the penicillin treatment the population of S. mutans and S. sanguis gradually increased. In man, the effect of oral penicillin therapy was examined in 21 adults with more than 2 X 10(5) S. mutans per ml saliva. The penicillin treatment had almost no effect on the numbers of S. sanguis and lactobacilli, but a pronounced decrease in the number of S. mutans was observed. The duration of this effect, however, was short. Consequently, such treatment alone is of limited value for the control of the oral infection of these microorganisms.
TI  - Influence of sodium and potassium ions on acid production by washed cells of Streptococcus mutans ingbritt and Streptococcus sanguis NCTC 7865 grown in a chemostat.
AB  - A comparison was made of acid production by cells of Streptococcus mutans Ingbritt and S. sanguis NCTC 7865 that had been washed twice and incubated in different concentrations of sodium and potassium ions. Organisms were grown under defined conditions in a chemostat under both glucose limitation and glucose excess conditions at a dilution rate of 0.1 h(-1) (mean generation time, 6.9 h). Acid production after a pulse of glucose, sucrose, and fructose was measured by pH fall experiments and as a rate at pH 7.0. S. mutans produced more acid than S. sanguis as measured by either criterion, although statistically faster rates of acid production and lower terminal pH values were obtained when cells of both species were suspended in KCl rather than in NaCl, with 200 mM KCl resulting in the lowest terminal pH in pH fall experiments. Sodium ions inhibited acid production: 183 mM NaCl reduced the glycolytic rates of S. mutans and S. sanguis metabolizing glucose at pH 7.0 in 135 mM KCl by 39 and 33%, respectively. The most pronounced stimulatory effect of potassium on acid production was by washed cells of S. sanguis that had been grown under arginine and under phosphate limitation. The pH fell by a further 0.86 and 1.21 pH units, respectively, and to below the critical pH for enamel demineralization when these cells were metabolizing glucose in 135 mM KCl compared with the same concentration of NaCl. This enhancement of acid production was not due to potassium translocation, as had been suggested previously, because no movement of potassium ions across the cell membrane could be detected. An alternative explanation is proposed in which sodium ions are excluded from the cell at the expense of membrane energy, i.e., the proton motive force, which could otherwise be used for the transport of sugars.
TI  - Phagocytic and killing activity of human blood, gingival crevicular, and salivary polymorphonuclear leukocytes for oral streptococci.
AB  - The phagocytosis and killing of oral streptococci by blood, crevicular, and salivary polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) were examined using a visual assay based on differential staining of viable and non-viable microorganisms by acridine orange. Crevicular PMNL were 83% viable, 19% contained bacteria on collection, and phagocytosis occurred in vitro in 66% of glass-adherent leukocytes. Salivary PMNL were 56% viable, 11% contained bacteria on collection, and 44% phagocytosed streptococci in vitro. Crevicular and salivary PMNL were capable of phagocytosis and killing of oral streptococci, but both were impaired. Crevicular fluid was not significantly leukotoxic; mixed saliva caused a significant reduction in PMNL viability and in phagocytic and killing activity for oral streptococci. Crevicular PMNL may be actively functional phagocytes, but salivary PMNL are unlikely to be significant in oral defenses.
TI  - Effect of gramicidin D on the acidogenic properties of oral streptococci and human dental plaque.
AB  - The effect of gramicidin D, Gramicidin S, and carbonylcyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenyl hydrazone on the glycolysis of various oral streptococci was investigated. Gramicidin D was the most effective and inhibited the glycolysis of all the streptococci studied in the presence of the most common sugars found in man's diet (sucrose, lactose, glucose, and fructose). A concentration of 2.5 X 10(-6) M gramicidin D was sufficient to decrease significantly the rate of glycolysis of human dental plaque in the presence of sucrose. The use of this ionophore as a caries preventive agent is discussed.
TI  - Plasmid-mediated transformation of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans GS-5 was transformed to erythromycin resistance with streptococcal plasmid pVA736. Transformation frequencies were higher with plasmids reisolated from transformed GS-5 cells relative to plasmid originally derived from S. sanguis Challis.
TI  - Microbial populations growing in the presence of fluoride at low pH isolated from dental plaque of children living in an area with fluoridated water.
AB  - Longitudinal microbiological examinations have been made of dental plaque from a  site approximal to the upper central incisors of 10 8-year-old children living in an area with water fluoridation. Differential counts of viable bacteria, made using a selective medium containing various levels of fluoride (0 to 100 mug/ml) at pH levels of 7.0 to 5.5, demonstrated an effect of both pH and fluoride on the numbers and types of bacteria isolated. Strains of Streptococcus and Neisseria grew after only 16 h of incubation at pH levels as low as 6.0 with fluoride levels up to 50 mug/ml. The most commonly isolated streptococci were Streptococcus mitior and S. salivarius. S. mutans was isolated less frequently and was inhibited by 20 and 50 mug of fluoride per ml at pH 6.0 and 6.5, respectively. Veillonella strains were the most resistant isolates, being isolated after 16 h of incubation on media at pH 6.0 with 100 mug of fluoride per ml. Despite their known fluoride resistance, Actinomyces spp. were often only detected on the selective media after 72 h of incubation. The pH of the medium had a definite selective effect, as the number of colonies growing on the fluoride-free basal media at pH 6.0 was only 30% of that at pH 7.0. Representative strains of S. mutans, S. mitior, S. sanguis, and S. milleri were tested for their ability to utilize glucose at the pH and fluoride levels of the medium on which they were initially isolated. Fluoride reduced the initial glycolytic rate of the cells, but in 5 of the 13 strains tested the final amount of glucose used after 2 h of incubation was the same in the presence or absence of fluoride. The isolation of bacteria capable of growth in the presence of fluoride over a significant portion of the pH range that occurs in plaque in vivo could explain in part the finding that fluoride does not have a dramatic effect on the plaque community. Fluoride in plaque may reduce the ecological advantage afforded to aciduric S. mutans strains by carbohydrate substances. In the in vivo situation this could mean that, even with high carbohydrate intake, fluoride may permit S. mitior to compete with S. mutans within the plaque ecosystem.
TI  - Adsorption of lysozyme from human whole saliva by Streptococcus sanguis 903 and other oral microorganisms.
AB  - Several strains of Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Actinomyces viscosus, and Actinomyces naeslundii plus fresh isolates of Streptococcus salivarius were surveyed for their abilities to deplete lysozyme from human-whole-saliva supernatant. Bacteria were incubated in saliva for 60 min at 37 degrees C and then removed by centrifugation, and the recovered supernatant solutions were assayed for lysozyme activity by using whole cells of Micrococcus lysodeikticus as the substrate. Mean lysozyme depletions by bacterial strains varied over a wide (eightfold) range. The greatest mean depletion of lysozyme (60 to 70%) was observed with S. sanguis (biotype I), serotype b of S. mutans, and the fresh S. salivarius isolates. The lowest mean depletion was noted with S. mitis (15%) and biotype II S. sanguis (ca. 30%). The remaining species and strains exhibited an intermediate degree of depletion. In studies with S. sanguis 903, lysozyme was depleted by normal or heated (90 degrees C, 30 min) bacteria and could be recovered from the organism. Furthermore, under appropriate conditions, lysozyme depletion by cells at 0 and 37 degrees C was very similar. On the basis of these observations, we concluded that depletion was due to the adsorption of lysozyme by the organism. With S. sanguis 903, lysozyme adsorption depended on the concentration of bacteria, time of incubation, and the ionic strength of the medium. The extent of adsorption, however, was independent of pH's of 3.9 to 8.3. When a low concentration of S. sanguis 903 was used, lysozyme adsorption reached saturation (4 mug of adsorbed lysozyme per 10(7) cells) at 20 mug of lysozyme added per ml. Salivary lysozyme adsorption by several other oral microorganisms (A. viscosus WVU 626 and WVU 627, S. sanguis 73x11, S. mutans BHT, and S. salivarius NG) was similar to that of S. sanguis 903 in sensitivity to ionic strength. Lysozyme adsorption by S. sanguis 903 from either a buffer solution or a saliva supernatant was more sensitive to ionic strength at 0 than at 37 degrees C. On the basis of results from experiments in saliva versus buffer, we concluded that saliva had no major effect on the extent of lysozyme adsorption by S. sanguis 903 other than providing a source of ionic strength. A comparison of pH and ionic strength effects on lysozyme adsorption by S. sanguis 903 with literature reports of lysozyme lysis of whole cells and hydrolysis of cell walls, peptidoglycan, and (GlcNAc)(4) suggested that adsorption by S. sanguis 903 was more dependent on electrostatic interactions than was lysozyme catalysis. The possibility is discussed that anionic bacterial surface components mediate lysozyme adsorption and temper the potential effects of lysozyme on the microorganisms.
TI  - Enzymatic modification of bacterial receptors on saliva-treated hydroxyapatite surfaces.
AB  - Certain properties of experimental pellicles formed by the adsorption of salivary components on hydroxyapatite surfaces change over time. To determine whether enzymes likely to be present in the oral environment could induce such changes, pellicles were treated with saliva which had been incubated for 18 h at 35 degrees C to promote the elaboration of microbial enzymes. This treatment markedly reduced the numbers of Streptococcus mutans MT3 and JBP and S. sanguis FC-1 and C5 cells which attached, but it had little or no effect on the attachment of S. mitis RE7, Actinomyces viscosus LY7 and CK-8, Bacteroides gingivalis 381, or B. melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius 581. Heating the incubated saliva at 60 degrees C for 30 min partially reduced its pellicle-modifying activity, whereas heating at 80 degrees C for 30 min or 100 degrees C for 15 min completely eliminated such activity. This indicated that the saliva contained heat-labile substances, presumably enzymes, which could affect the pellicle receptors involved in the attachment of S. mutans and S. sanguis. Treatment of saliva-treated hydroxyapatite with commercially obtained enzyme preparations also affected bacterial attachment. Thus, treatment with galactose oxidase reduced the numbers of the S. mutans strains which attached, whereas treatment with neuraminidase reduced the adsorption of S. sanguis FC-1 but not that of S. sanguis C5. Treatment with beta-glucosidase preparations derived from almonds significantly reduced the attachment of all of the streptococcal strains studied, but, when subjected to isoelectric fractionation, the adherence-inhibiting activity did not correlate directly with beta-glucosidase activity. Treatment of the pellicles with trypsin or eight other glycosidases did not affect streptococcal attachment. Exposure of the enzymatically modified pellicles to fresh saliva did not restore the streptococcal receptors. Collectively, the data suggest that some bacterial receptors in the pellicle coating of teeth can be modified by enzymes likely to be present in the oral environment, and these interactions may affect oral bacterial ecology.
TI  - Purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - An inhibition factor from Streptococcus mutans strain C3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. Bacteriocin C3603 is a basic protein with a pI value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. The activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by pH over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees C for 10 min at pH 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees C for 15 min at pH 4.0. Pronase; papain, phospholipase C, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. Bacteriocin activity was greater against certain S. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and f than against certain S. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. Bacteriocin C3603 was also effective against selected strains of S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. bovis, S. faecium, S. lactis, Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, L. fermentum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum, Propionibacterium acnes, and Bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Corynebacterium parvum, and Candida albicans. The inhibition of S. mutans strains BHT and PS-14 by bacteriocin C3603 was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. When water or a diet containing bacteriocin C3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with S. mutans PS-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.
TI  - A microbiological analysis of human early carious and non-carious fissures.
AB  - The fissure sampling technique consisted of removing the fissure using a bur in a high-speed handpiece with water spray and then suctioning the fissural contents and the water spray into a sterile sampling container. Sixty-eight teeth were sampled. Total bacterial counts, total streptococcal counts, and counts of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus faecalis, Actinomyces viscosus, and lactobacilli were performed on the fissural samples. There was a four-fold increase in the total number of microorganisms recovered from carious (N = 48) compared to non-carious (N = 20) fissures. S. mutans was the only microorganism common to all carious fissures.
TI  - Oral flora of children with "nursing bottle caries".
AB  - S. mutans averaged about 60% of the total cultivable flora of dental plaque obtained from caries lesions, white spot margins of these lesions, or clinically-sound areas of upper anterior teeth, and averaged about 27% in plaque from mostly clinically-sound areas of posterior teeth of six children with nursing bottle caries; its concentrations in saliva averaged about 10% of the total cultivable flora. Nearly all of 107 isolated S. mutans strains belonged to the serotype group c/e/f. The proportion of S. sanguis, in contrast to those of S. mutans, were very low in plaque from upper anterior teeth and higher in plaque from posterior teeth. The proportions of S. salivarius in saliva were unusually low, and this organism was not detected in the saliva of most subjects. Lactobacilli were found in nearly all plaque samples; plaque and carious material from cavities contained higher levels than plaque associated with white spots or clinically-sound tooth surfaces. The findings provide further support for the role of S. mutans in the initiation of human dental caries. In the case of lactobacilli, they support other evidence suggesting only the limited involvement of these organisms in the initiation of caries lesions, but a more extensive role in their progression. In addition, they clearly illustrate the marked effect of diet on the dental plaque flora.
TI  - Comparison of computer methods for taxonomy of some streptococci using gas chromatographic chemotaxonomic data.
AB  - Gas chromatographic fingerprints of eighty-three strains of Streptococcus were analysed by computer. Seven measures of association were compared for their ability to identify strains. The most effective measure was the Stack coefficient which correctly identified 68% of strains, mostly of oral origin. Clustering of strains was carried out by median, average, single-linkage, furthest neighbour, and centroid linkage, Andrew's plots, and Minimum Spanning Trees. Of the clustering methods, centroid linkage produced the most inclusive and compact clusters. Clusters of strains of S. mitis, S. mutans, S. salivarius and S. sanguis showed varying degrees of heterogeneity; while, S. milleri was comprised of three chemotypes corresponding to oral isolates, biochemically atypical vaginal isolates, and biochemically typical strains from other sources.
TI  - An effect of communal caging on the streptococcal flora of the dental plaque of monkeys (Macaca fascicularis).
AB  - 22 monkeys were randomly allocated to one or other of 2 communes and fed a caries-promoting high sucrose diet. After 28 weeks commune 1 (13 monkeys) was found to harbour Streptococcus mutans serotype e as the predominant streptococcal species, but no monkey in commune 2 harboured this serotype. Instead the 9 monkeys of commune 2 harboured Streptococcus milleri in their dental plaque. The significance of these observations on the use of monkeys as a model of human dental caries is discussed.
TI  - The streptococcal flora of the tongue of the monkey Macaca fascicularis.
AB  - The major streptococcal biotypes in the 8 monkeys investigated resembled Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mitior with Streptococcus salivarius forming only 5 to 6 per cent of the total colony count and being isolated from only 4 monkeys. The predominant tongue streptococci were not isolated from the dental plaque. Similarly, Streptococcus mutans, present in large numbers in the plaque of monkeys fed sucrose-rich diets, was isolated from the tongue of only 2 animals and formed only 2.4 per cent of the total colony count. Changing from a starch-based maintenance diet to sucrose-rich diets did not significantly alter the tongue flora except that the proportion of typical Strep. sanguis was significantly reduced. The oral streptococcal flora of monkeys is similar in distribution to that found in the human mouth.
TI  - Lactoperoxidase and thiocyanate protect bacteria from hydrogen peroxide.
AB  - Lactoperoxidase and thiocyanate were shown to protect Escherichia coli and three  oral streptococcal species from the bactericidal effect of hydrogen peroxide under aerobic conditions. Lactoperoxidase in the absence of thiocyanate was also protective for two of the bacterial species in a dilution medium but potentiated hydrogen peroxide toxicity for the other two under the same conditions. The products of the reaction between hydrogen peroxide and thiocyanate in the presence of lactoperoxidase were not bactericidal except in the case of E. coli, and then only under special conditions. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of lactoperoxidase and thiocyanate in protecting living cells from hydrogen peroxide toxicity. Although the effect on human cells was not examined in this study, extrapolation of these results to the cells of the oral mucosa would suggest an important protective role of lactoperoxidase and thiocyanate against the toxic effects of hydrogen peroxide in the oral cavity.
TI  - Minimum inhibitory concentration of surfactants for plaque antiadherents.
AB  
TI  - Production of acids in rat dental plaque with or without Streptococcus mutans.
AB  
TI  - Blood-group-reactive glycoprotein from human saliva interacts with lipoteichoic acid on the surface of Streptococcus sanguis cells.
AB  - [3H]-Glycerol-labelled lipoteichoic acid (LTA) was extracted from Streptococcus sanguis cells using aqueous phenol. Chemical analysis of the LTA yielded phosphate:glycerol:glucose:fatty acids in the mole ratio 1.0:0.97:0.76:0.03. The LTA inhibited the interaction between Strep. sanguis cells and a high mol. wt blood-group-reactive glycoprotein (BGR-glycoprotein) isolated from human saliva and reduced Strep. sanguis-mediated haemagglutination activity. Purified LTA from Strep. mutans strains OMZ61 and HS6, which have been shown not to interact with the BGR-glycoprotein, also inhibited the BGR-glycoprotein mediated aggregation of Strep. sanguis, as did an antiserum prepared against Lactobacillus casei LTA. It is proposed that the binding of the salivary glycoprotein to Strep. sanguis cells in achieved through LTA associated with bacterial surface fibrils.
TI  - The effect of fluoride on the acid production of Streptococcus mutans and other oral streptococci.
AB  - The influence of fluoride on the acid production of streptococcal strains was examined using an established method for the determination of acid production by microorganisms. The inhibitory effects of fluoride on acid production increased when the pH dropped from 5.5 to 4.0. A concentration of 5 ppm fluoride inhibited the acid production activity of Streptococcus mutants at pH 5 and below. Susceptibility to fluoride varied among streptococcal strains. These results suggest that fluoride in dental plaque may affect acid production below pH 5.5.
TI  - A comparative study of enzymes involved in glucose phosphorylation in oral streptococci.
AB  - The properties of two enzymes involved in the phosphorylation of glucose were studied in three oral streptococci species. The glucokinase of Streptococcus mutans had a lower affinity for glucose and ATP than did those from S. salivarius and S. sanguis. The enzyme had an identical pH optimum (pH 8.0) in all three bacteria. However, the result from the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system showed a different pattern when its activity was measured using 2-deoxyglucose with toluenized cells. Uptake studies of 2-deoxyglucose also revealed that the three microorganisms had different affinities for this compound. This glucose analogue strongly inhibited the acid production of S. salivarius, but did not affect the glycolysis of the other two bacteria.
TI  - Molecular cloning in the Streptococci.
AB  
TI  - Characteristic differences between saliva-dependent aggregation and adhesion of streptococci.
AB  - Comparison of saliva-mediated aggregation of Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, and Streptococcus mutans and adhesion of these organisms to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite showed that there was no relationship between these two activities. Adsorption of salivary aggregating activity to bacteria appears to have little effect on the ability of the residual saliva to support adherence; conversely, adsorption of salivary adherence factors to hydroxyapatite does not affect aggregation. Although heating saliva significantly reduces bacterial aggregation, it has little or no effect on adherence. A comparison of aggregation and adhesion with serial dilutions of saliva demonstrated that adhesion could still be detected at 100 to 500-fold-lower concentrations of salivary protein that bacterial aggregation. These findings support the concept that aggregation and adherence involve two distinct mechanisms of microbial clearance in the oral cavity.
TI  - Enolases from fluoride-sensitive and fluoride-resistant streptococci.
AB  - The enolase from a highly fluoride-sensitive strain of Streptococcus salivarius and its fluoride-resistant mutant, as well as those from strains of Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mutans with intermediate and low sensitivities to fluoride have been shown to be inhibited by fluoride. Comparisons of the purified, strain-specific enzymes showed a high degree of similarity for all preparations. The Michaelis constants for the substrate 2-phosphoglycerate were 1.3 x 10(-4) to 2.4 x 10(-4) M, pH optima were 7.3 to 7.7, and Mg2+ optima were 2 mEq/liter for all. Inhibition by fluoride required the presence of inorganic phosphate and was competitive in nature, and the calculated modified inhibition indices were found to be in the range from 3.3 x 10(-14) to 5.8 x 10(-14) M4. Percent inhibitions were determined under standardized conditions (0.16 mM NaF, 2 mM MgSO4, 0.5 mM Pi, and 0.5 mM 2-phosphoglycerate) and were found to range from 53.3 to 65.9% for all of the purified enzymes. The differences do not appear to be meaningful metabolically. Inhibition was reduced to about 14% at pH 6.0. From the similarities in the behavior of the strain-specific enzymes it is concluded that the differences in the glycolytic sensitivities of the different strains of streptococci to fluoride are not the consequence of any kinetic differences between the respective enolases.
TI  - Examination of Streptococcus mutans for immunoglobulin G Fc reactivity.
AB  - Representative strains of oral streptococci were tested for Fc immunoglobulin G (IgG) reactivity by two different techniques, agglutination of rabbit-IgG sensitized sheep erythrocytes and uptake of human and rabbit 125I-radiolabeled IgG. None of the S. mutans serotypes a through e reacted with the Fc region of either human or rabbit IgG. Additionally, other streptococci such as S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. faecalis, and S. mitis failed to show appreciable Fc reactivity as assayed by these techniques. The group A, C, and G streptococci, previously shown to possess Fc reactivity, proved to be reactive in these experiments, as did a protein A-containing strain of Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Sucrose-induced ecological response of experimental dental plaques from caries-free and caries-susceptible Human volunteers.
AB  - Microbial succession, experimental cariogenicity, and sucrose metabolism were examined in dental plaques which developed on sterile bovine enamel inserts in acrylic palatal appliances. The appliances were worn for a period of 14 days by 10 caries-free and 10 caries-susceptible human volunteers. Three of six enamel inserts on each appliance were exposed extraorally to 10% sucrose in 0.85% saline six times a day, and three were exposed simultaneously to 0.85% saline as a control environment. The responses of the plaques to the high-sucrose environment in both caries status populations were compared. In all plaques, exposure to 10% sucrose stimulated the succession of Veillonella spp., Lactobacillus spp., Streptococcus salivarius, and, to a lesser extent, Streptococcus mutans and a decline in levels of Streptococcus sanguis, Neisseria spp., and gram-negative anaerobic rods. Plaques from caries-free mouths, in contrast to those from caries-susceptible mouths, harbored higher levels of Veillonella spp., gram-negative anaerobic rods, and Neisseria spp. and lower levels of Lactobacillus spp. Sucrose-exposed plaques from caries-free mouths also induced less enamel microhardness changes and formed less lactic acid from [14C]sucrose during a 60-min incubation at 37 degrees C than did comparable plaques from caries-susceptible mouths. The experiments revealed consistent differences in the ecological response to a cariogenic substrate environment in plaques from the two populations, with plaques from caries-free subjects exhibiting less cariogenic potential than those from caries-susceptible subjects.
TI  - Microbial analyses of dental plaque of monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) using fluorescent antibody techniques.
AB  - Selected microbial components in supragingival dental plaque from recently captured monkeys were determined. Using specific fluorescent antibody (FA) conjugates S. sanguis was found to constitute an average of 11.8% of all cells. The populations of Actinomyces accounted for 20.7% (range 5-31) with A. viscosus and A. naeslundii as predominant species. Few lactobacilli were encountered. S. mutans was not detected in any specimens when examined by culture and FA.
TI  - In vitro effect of tobacco on the growth of oral cariogenic streptococci.
AB  - Most pouch and plug chewing tobaccos with high sugar contents are able to support the growth of S mutans and S sanguis in vitro. Snuff and unprocessed tobacco, although not able to stimulate growth of these organisms, do not inhibit growth. Inhibitory agents present in tobacco leaves do not preclude use of tobacco sugars by the organisms tested. Because factors other than bacterial populations play an important role in caries initiation, clinical studies are needed to identify the effects of commercial tobacco on the human dentition.
TI  - Utilization of hydroxyapatite adsorbable salivary proteins as growth substrates for plaque-forming oral streptococci.
AB  - Following treatment with hydroxyapatite, clarified mixed saliva from one donor source lost much of its growth-supportive activity for S. mutans VA-29R (type c). Growth of the organism in a basal medium containing proteins desorbed from HA with 0.067 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, was accompanied by the disappearance of some of the proteins, including those with isoelectric points of 4.90, 5.72, and 6.00. These proteins are among those known to be specifically attacked by S. mutans. These findings suggest that some of the proteins selectively adsorbed from saliva with HA may serve as specific growth substrates for the plaque-forming oral streptococci.
TI  - Bacteriocin production by Streptococcus salivarius strain P.
AB  - A bacteriocin, streptococcin sal-P, was isolated by freeze-thaw elution from cultures of Streptococcus salivarius strain P grown on tryptic soy agar plus 1% neopeptone. The inhibitor could also be extracted with either 7 M urea of 1 M NaCl from cells grown on this medium, but little activity was recovered from cells grown in liquid media of from the supernatants of these cultures. Streptococcin sal-P was found to be a proteinaceous substance of molecular weight approximately 8000. It was remarkably stable at extremes of pH or temperature and appeared to adsorb nonspecifically to both sensitive and resistant bacterial cells and also to cellulose membranes. The range of its inhibitory activity was almost entirely against Gram-positive bacteria, particularly streptococci, including strains of S. pyogenes and S. sanguis, but not S. mutans or group D streptococci. Streptococcin sal-P was bactericidal for actively metabolizing susceptible strains.
TI  - Salivary immunoglobulin A antibodies reacting with antigens from oral streptococci: longitudinal study in humans.
AB  - The salivary immunoglobulin A (IgA) activity to antigens from four common oral streptococci was analyzed in samples from five humans. From each individual, parotid and whole saliva were collected 12 times over a period of 4 months. In samples collected at different occasions, the salivary IgA activity varied considerably. The variations showed a covariation with the concentration of total IgA in the saliva samples. A covariation was also found between salivary IgA antibodies of different specificity. It is concluded that reference antigens, in combination with measurement of total IgA concentration, ought to be used when evaluating the salivary IgA response in humans.
TI  - Ultrastructural location of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis antigens in carious human dentine.
AB  - The ultrastructural localization of bacterial antigens of Streptococcus sanguis and of the various serotypes a,b,c,d,e,f and g of Streptococcus mutans was studied in human carious dentine using the indirect peroxidase-antiperoxidase method with appropriate controls. No positive staining was seen in adjacent normal dentine. In the inner dentine underlying the cytoplasm of fibroblasts and Schwann cells of unmyelinated nerve fibrils. In sclerosed tubules, or on the plasmalemma of the odontoblast process or on both structures. Only in the odontoblast, facing the carious cone, were dense stainings noted in vacuoles of various sizes located in the Golgi apparatus in juxta-nuclear position and in their odontoblast processes. In pulpal regions, underlying the carious cone, dense vacuoles were also observed in the cytoplasm of fibroblasts and Schwann cells of unmyelinated nerve fibrils. In sclerosed tubules, electron dense deposits were noted in the lumen and the walls of the calcified tubules. In the outer carious dentine, invaded by micro-organisms, positive antigenic stainings were observed in the cell wall and capsular material of a great number of micro-organisms as well as in the interbacterial matrix.
TI  - Inactivation of D-glucosyltransferases from oral Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis by photochemical oxidation.
AB  - Cell-free D-glucosyltransferase of D-glucose-grown Streptococcus mutans AHT was completely inactivated in the presence of 0.002% of Methylene Blue at 25 degrees and pH 7.0 after illumination with a 150-W incandescent lamp. The rate of inactivation was decreased at pH values less than 7.0. Histidine was the only amino acid residue modified to a significant extent, and the rates of oxidation of histidine residues and loss of enzyme activity closely agreed. Production of both water-insoluble and -soluble D-glucan fractions from sucrose by the oxidized D-glucosyltransferase preparations was significantly inhibited. Photooxidation with 0.002% of Rose Bengal at pH 7.0 or higher also induced complete inactivation of the D-glucosyltransferase. These results strongly suggest that the imidazole portion of histidine may function as part of the active sites of both D-glucosyltransferase isozymes of S. mutans AHT, which are responsible for the synthesis of (1 goes to 3)- and (1 goes to 6)-alpha-D-glucosidic linkages. The D-glucosyltransferases from S. mutans 6715 and AHT-mutant M1, and Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10558 were also almost completely inactivated by Methylene Blue-sensitized photooxidation.
TI  - Genetic transformation of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Three strains of Streptococcus mutans belonging to serotypes a, c, and f were transformed to streptomycin resistance by deoxyribonucleic acids derived from homologous and heterologous streptomycin-resistant strains of S. mutans and Streptococcus sanguis strain Challis. Homologous transformation of S. mutans was less efficient than heterologous transformation by deoxyribonucleic acids from other strains of S. mutans.
TI  - Effect of chlorhexidine gel treatment on Streptococcus mutans population in human saliva and dental plaque.
AB  - The effect of topical application of a 1% chlorhexidine gel on the population of  S. mutans in dental plaque and saliva was studied in five subjects highly infected with the organism. After treatment for 5 min daily for 14 d, S. mutans was not detected in three of the subjects and counts of 700 colony-forming units or less per ml of saliva were found in the other subjects. Reappearance of S. mutans was slow and did not reach pretreatment level until 14 weeks or more after therapy. The proportion of S. sanguis in plaque increased temporarily after chlorhexidine treatment, whereas the population of lactobacilli was unaffected. These observations indicate that short-term use of chlorhexidine is of value in controlling oral infection of humans by S. mutans.
TI  - Adherence of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis to salivary components bound to glass.
AB  - Adherence of radiolabeled Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis to saliva-treated glass surfaces was studied under conditions which minimized bacteria-glass interactions. Treatment of glass with an alkylsilane solution decreased nonspecific bacterial adherence and enhanced adsorption of radiolabeled salivary components to these surfaces. Addition of Triton X-100 to the bacterial suspensions also reduced nonspecific adherence to siliconized glass, but did not affect adherence to salivary components attached to siliconized glass. Calcium stimulated S. mutans adherence to saliva-free glass, but inhibited adherence to saliva-treated glass. S. sanguis adherence to either saliva-free or saliva-treated glass was inhibited slightly at high calcium ion concentrations. Adherence of streptococci to saliva-treated glass exhibited saturation kinetics, and the numbers of binding sites on the experimental salivary pellicle and the affinity constants for bacteria-saliva attachment were determined. Preincubation of the streptococci with whole saliva decreased their capacity to adhere to saliva-treated glass, but not to saliva-free glass. Bacteria adherent to saliva-treated glass surfaces were readily desorbed by washing with saliva. The addition of homologous antisera, ammonium sulfate-precipitated immunoglobulins, or Fab fragments to the bacterial suspensions inhibited cell adherence to saliva-treated glass.
TI  - Lectin-like constituents of foods which react with components of serum, saliva, and Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Hot and cold aqueous extracts were prepared from 22 commonly ingested fruits, vegetables, and seeds. When tested by agar diffusion, extracts from 13 and 10 of the foods formed precipitin bands with samples of normal rabbit serum and human saliva, respectively; extracts from four of the foods also reacted with antigen extracts of strains of Streptococcus mutans. When added to rabbit antiserum, extracts from 18 of 21 foods tested inhibited reactivity with antigen extracts derived from S. mutans MT3. Extracts from 16 foods agglutinated whole S. mutans cells, whereas those from 10 foods agglutinated human erythrocytes of blood types A and B. The lectin-like activities of extracts which reacted with human saliva were studied further. Pretreatment of saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (S-HA) beads with extracts of bananas, coconuts, carrots, alfalfa, and sunflower seeds markedly reduced the subsequent adsorption of S. mutans MT3. Pretreatment of S-HA with banana extract also strongly inhibited adsorption of S. mutans H12 and S. sanguis C1, but it had little effect on attachment of Actinomyces naeslundii L13 or A. viscosus LY7. Absorption experiments indicated that the component(s) in banana extract responsible for inhibiting streptococcal adsorption to S-HA was identical to that which bound to human erythrocytes. The banana hemagglutinin exhibited highest activity between pH 7 and 8, and it was inhibited by high concentrations of glucosamine, galactosamine, and, to a lesser extent, mannosamine. Other sugars tested had no effect. The selective bacterial adsorption-inhibiting effect noted for banana extract was also observed in studies with purified lectins. Thus, pretreating S-HA with wheat germ agglutinin and concanavalin A inhibited adsorption of S. mutans MT3 cells, whereas peanut agglutinin, Ulex agglutinin, Dolichos agglutinin, and soybean agglutinin had little effect; none of these lectins affected attachment of A. viscosus LY7. Collectively, the observations suggest that many foods contain lectins which can interact with components of human saliva and S. mutans cells. Because of their potential to influence host-parasite interactions in the mouth and elsewhere in the gastrointestinal canal, these reactions warrant further study.
TI  - Adherence of Streptococcus sanguis clinical isolates to smooth surfaces and interactions of the isolates with Streptococcus mutans glucosyltransferase.
AB  - Streptococcus sanguis isolated from human dental plaque were grown in Todd-Hewitt broth. Cells were collected by centrifugation and lyophilized after extensive washing with water. The cell-associated glucosyltransferase (GTase) activities of S. sanguis strains were assayed with [14C]sucrose. Strain differences in GTase activity were significant within the same serotype or biotype or both. The ability of S. sanguis cells to adhere to smooth glass surfaces was generally weak, irrespective of significant cell-associated GTase activity synthesizing water-insoluble, gel-like glucans. Resting cells of most S. sanguis strains bound extracellular GTase from Streptococcus mutans strain B13 (serotype d), resulting in the strong adherence of the S. sanguis cells to smooth glass surfaces in the presence of sucrose. Conversely, S. mutans B13 cells also could bind extracellular GTase from some strains of S. sanguis examined. The sucrose-dependent adherence of S. mutans cells was not altered, although S. sanguis strains from which the extracellular GTases were obtained did not produce significant adherence in the presence of sucrose. In view of these findings, it was suggested that S. mutans GTase could affect the adherence of S. sanguis to smooth tooth surfaces in the oral cavity.
TI  - Bacterial aggregating activity in human saliva: comparisons of bacterial species  and strains.
AB  - Using a quantitative assay to measure saliva-mediated bacterial aggregating activity, we have surveyed 20 streptococcal strains with saliva samples obtained from a large population study. Individual saliva samples demonstrated characteristic levels of aggregating activity for Streptococcus sanguis M5. In general, high activity for this strain was associated with high activity for other strains of S. sanguis. Streptococcus mitis, and Streptococcus salivarius. The population distribution of aggregating activity for Streptococcus mutans, however, was different.
TI  - Bacterial adherence: adhesin-receptor interactions mediating the attachment of bacteria to mucosal surface.
AB  - Recent studies have indicated that the attachment of bacteria to mucosal surfaces is the initial event in the pathogenesis of most infectious diseases due to bacteria in animals and humans. An understanding of the mechanisms of attachment and a definition of the adhesive molecules on the surfaces of bacteria (adhesins) as well as those on host cell membranes (receptors) have suggested new approaches to the prevention of serious bacterial infections: (1) application of purified adhesion or receptor materials or their analogues as competitive inhibitors of bacterial adherence; (2) administration of sublethal concentrations of antibiotics that suppress the formation and expression of bacterial adhesins; and (3) development of vaccines against bacterial surface components involved in adhesion to mucosal surfaces. Progress has already been made in the development of antiadhesive vaccines directed against the fimbrial adhesins of several human bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Interference of secretory immunoglobulin A with sorption of oral bacteria to hydroxyapatite.
AB  - The potential of secretory immunoglobulin A (S-IgA) to interfere with the initial phase of dental plaque formation was studied by using an in vitro method which permits the quantitative determination of the sorption of radiolabeled oral bacterial cells to hydroxyapatite (HA) beads. The importance of specific S-IgA antibodies was evaluated by a comparison of the effect of pure preparations of colostral S-IgA, polymeric myeloma IgA, or preabsorbed S-IgA. Specific antibody molecules bound at the HA surface significantly enhanced the sorption of two Streptococcus sanguis strains. In contrast, HA-bound S-IgA antibodies inhibited the sorption of Streptococcus mitior and Streptococcus salivarius. The same was true for Streptococcus mutans cells, but only when they were propagated in the absence of sucrose. Suspended in saliva, cells of all streptococcal species adhered in significantly lower numbers to HA. Comparative experiments with bacteria suspended in solutions of various preparations of IgA or immunoglobulin-deficient salivas with S-IgA or myeloma IgA added indicated that the adherence inhibition seen with S. Sanguis, S. mitior, S. salivarius, and glucose-grown S. mutans was partly attributable to functions of S-IgA antibodies. Under the in vitro conditions of the study, S-IgA antibodies had no effect on the sorption of sucrose-grown S. mutans, Actinomyces viscosus, and Actinomyces naeslundii to HA. The results indicated that S-IgA can interfere with the sorption of some oral bacteria to HA by several different functions.
TI  - Effect of human saliva on glucose uptake by Streptococcus mutans and other oral microorganisms.
AB  - We examined the effects of human whole salivary supernatant and parotid fluid on  glucose uptake by Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Actinomyces viscosus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. The following three effects of saliva were observed: (i) inhibition of glucose uptake (S. mutans, S. sanguis), (ii) promotion of a transient, rapid (0 to 30 s) burst of glucose uptake (S. mutans, S. sanguis), and (iii) enhancement of glucose uptake (S. mitis, A. viscosus, S. aureus, E. coli). We observed no differences between the effects of whole salivary supernatant and the effects of parotid fluid. Heat treatment (80 degrees C, 10 min) of saliva or the addition of dithiothreitol abolished inhibition of glucose uptake. Supplementation of saliva with H(2)O(2) potentiated inhibition of glucose uptake. S. mitis and A. viscosus, which were stimulated by saliva alone, were inhibited by H(2)O(2)-supplemented saliva; 50% inhibition of glucose uptake by S. mutans and S. mitis required ca. 10 muM H(2)O(2) in 50% (vol/vol) saliva. Loss of the inhibitory action of saliva occurred at about 5% (vol/vol) saliva. Supplementation of saliva dilutions with SCN(-) and H(2)O(2) extended the inhibitory activity to solutions containing ca. 0.2% (vol/vol) saliva. We suggest that the salivary lactoperoxidase-SCN(-)-H(2)O(2) system is responsible for the inhibitory activity of saliva reported here. Furthermore, we concluded that lactoperoxidase and SCN(-) are present in saliva specimens in concentrations that exceed minimal inhibitory levels by factors of ca. 500 and 10 to 20, respectively. The resistance of A. viscosus, S. aureus, and E. coli to the inhibitory potential of saliva alone was probably due to the production of catalase by these organisms. The resistance of S. mitis may have been due to special effects of saliva on H(2)O(2) accumulation by this organism compared with S. mutans and S. sanguis. The basis of saliva-dependent enhancement of glucose uptake and the basis of promotion of a transient, rapid burst of glucose uptake are unknown. The role of the salivary lactoperoxidase-SCN(-)-H(2)O(2) system in the oral microbial ecosystem is discussed.
TI  - Fluoride accumulation by oral microorganisms.
AB  - Ten laboratory strains of oral microorganisms and 17 recent clinical isolates were examined for their ability to concentrate fluoride from a 1 ppm (0.05 mM NaF( fluoride solution. The laboratory strains concentrated the ion from two- to six-fold over the surrounding media. Clinical isolates of Actinomyces concentrated the ion to similar levels to the laboratory strains of this organism; however, clinical isolates of Streptococcus mutans and S. sanguis concentrated the fluoride significantly less than any of the laboratory strains examined.
TI  - Microbial surface interactions: reduction of the haemagglutination activity of the oral bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum by absorption with Streptococcus and Bacteroides.
AB  - Oral strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum showed haemagglutination (HA) of sheep red blood cells and attachment of HA-active F. nucleatum fragments to other microorganisms allowed a means of studying microbial surface interactions. HA-active sonicated fragments (SF) prepared from F. nucleatum were mixed with whole cell suspensions of 48 bacterial strains and, after incubation, the whole cells were separated from the non-absorbed fragments by differential centrifugation. Attachment of F. nucleatum fragments to the cells was indicated by a reduction in the HA activity of the SF in the supernatant fluid remaining after absorption with whole cells. HA activity of the microbial cells used for absorption and the detection of F. nucleatum fragments on these cells by an indirect fluorescent antibody technique provided further evidence of attachment. Of the 48 strains tested, 10 absorbed F. nucleatum HA-active fragments. They included Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides fragilis subsp. distasonis, Bacteroides corrodens, Streptococcus morbillorum, Streptococcus sanguis (Blackburn and JC 74) and Streptococcus mutans AHT, BHT, 10449 and 6715. Chelators revealed that F. nucleatum attached to the microorganisms via a Ca2+-dependent interaction. Sugar inhibition demonstrated that F. nucleatum attached to the microorganisms via a D-galactose-containing moiety on their surface. A reduction in the absorption of F. nucleatum HA-active fragments by Strep. mutans grown in a higher concentration of sucrose was observed.

TI  - Relationship between saliva and serum agglutination titers and post-irradiation caries activity in cancer patients.
AB  - Agglutination titers in 444 saliva and 481 serum samples from 36 head and neck cancer patients and 16 control subjects were determined against formalinized cellular antigens of Streptococcus and Lactobacillus species. Saliva agglutination titers were significantly higher in cancer patients before radiotherapy than in control subjects. Changes in specific saliva agglutination titers to oral isolates following radiotherapy reflected changes in saliva IgA and post-irradiation caries activity. Patients with no post-irradiation caries activity had significantly higher saliva agglutination titers to S. mutans, S. sanguis, and L. fermenti, lower plaque S. mutans counts, and higher saliva IgA levels than those with post-irradiation caries activity. Serum agglutination titers were unrelated to either serum immunoglobulin levels, microbial counts, or caries activity.
TI  - Common antigens of streptococcal and non-streptococcal oral bacteria: immunochemical studies of extracellular and cell-wall-associated antigens from Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Actinomyces viscosus.
AB  - Soluble extracellular antigens (ESA) were prepared from the culture supernatant of exponential growing cells of Streptococcus sanguis OMZ 9 by a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation and chromatography on a Bio-Gel P6 column. Soluble cell wall antigens (WEA) were obtained from the bacterial pellet by extraction with 1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6). Antisera against whole cells of S. sanguis and S. mutans of different serotypes, 10% trichloroacetic extracts of bacterial cell walls, dextran, ESA, and WEA were prepared by injecting the different antigens several times in rabbits. ESA and WEA were prepared from a representative strain of Bratthall's seven serological groups, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Actinomyces viscosus. All sera showed various agglutinin titers against heat-killed cells, and titers were generally higher with homologous cells. The comparison of the different antigens using agar gel diffusion and immunoelectrophoresis showed the presence of extracellular common antigens in both ESA and WEA between the different strains. Absorption of anti-ESA sera with WEA, and anti-WEA sera with ESA, showed the existence of a specific antigen common to all bacteria in each fraction. Enzymatic treatment of the antigen before immunodiffusion demonstrated the protein nature of the two antigens present in ESA and WEA.

TI  - Molecular cloning in streptococci: physical mapping of the vehicle plasmid pSM10  and demonstration of intergroup DNA transfer.
AB  - The streptococcal resistance plasmid pSM10 (8.3 kb), a deletion derivative of pSM10419 (22.9 kb) determining constitutive erythromycin and lincomycin resistance, was physically mapped with the restriction endonucleases AvaI, AvaII, EcoRI, HpaI, KpnI, PvuII (one site each), HindIII, HaeII (three sites each), HincII (four sites), and HhaI (five sites). Using the cryptic plasmid pVA318 as cloning vehicle, the largest HindIII fragment of pSM10 (3.3 kb) was shown to contain the erythromycin/lincomycin resistance gene(s) of the plasmid. The AvaII site of pSM10 proved to be suitable as a site for cloning AvaII-generated chromosomal DNA fragments from a group C streptococcal strain in the Challis strain of Streptococcus sanguis (group) H). A detailed physical map of the chimeric plasmid pSM10221 (12.8 kb), a fusion product of pSM10 and the staphylococcal chloramphenicol resistance plasmid pC221 (4.5 kb), is also presented. The plasmid chimera has properties making it potentially useful in development of a doubly selective streptococcal cloning vehicle by searching for insertional inactivation.
TI  - Molecular cloning of an erythromycin resistance determinant in streptococci.
AB  - The erythromycin resistance determinant of plasmid pDB102, a derivative of plasmid pSM19035, was cloned into the single HindIII site of the 3.6-megadalton cryptic Streptococcus mutans plasmid pVA318 and introduced into Streptococcus sanguis strain Challis by transformation. Plasmid pDB201, which was isolated from one of the transformants, consisted of the vector plasmid and the 1.15-megadalton HindIII fragment D of pSM19035. HindIII fragment D contained within it one of the two unique "spacer" sequences of pSM19035. Electron micrographs of self-annealed molecules of the recombinant plasmid revealed classical stem-loop structures, and the resistance determinant of pSM19035 appeared as a transposon-like structure. No differences were observed in either the type or the level of erythromycin resistance by pSM19035 or pDB201. The availability of a cloned erythromycin resistance determinant should be useful for future comparative studies of macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B resistance plasmids in streptococci.
TI  - Further characteristics of beta2-microglobulin binding to oral streptococci.
AB  - A total of 85 strains of oral bacteria representing Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, S. Mitior, S. salivarious, S. milleri, S. infrequens, S. durans, S. lactis, S. faecalis, S. faecium, S. equinus, Streptococcus species group E, Actinomyces, and one group A Streptococcus were tested for binding of aggregated human beta 2-microglobulin. Positive affinity between bacteria and aggregated human beta 2-microglobulin was detected in 36% of the strains. No apparent correlation with bacterial species, serotype, or group was noted. No positive strains were detected among seven group I:A S. sanguis strains (P < 0.01). Binding constants for one S. mutans strain indicated heterogeneous binding structures on the bacterial surface. The number of binding sites for aggregates of human beta 2-microglobulin involving multipoint attachment varied from 70 to 1,700 per bacterial cell. With whole saliva as buffer, a general increase in affinity was seen. Variations in salt concentrations of the buffers revealed different salt-dependent species-associated uptake patterns. Oral bacteria tended to have an uptake maximum at a salt concentration similar to that seen in saliva. Binding structures for aggregated beta 2-microglobulin on oral streptococci were sensitive to pepsin, heat, and formaldehyde treatment. Bacterial binding structures for aggregated beta 2-microglobulin might represent one of several factors of importance for bacterial attachment in the oral cavity. Experimental conditions reflecting the salivary milieu increased the degree of interaction, emphasizing the importance of physiological test systems for such studies.

TI  - Chimeric streptococcal plasmids and their use as molecular cloning vehicles in Streptococcus sanguis (Challis).
AB  - Chimeric plasmids, which were useful as cloning vehicles in a Streptococcus sanguis (Challis) host vector system, have been constructed. By using three different strategies of restriction endonuclease digestion and ligation, a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fragment bearing an erythromycin resistance determinant was ligated in vitro to a phenotypially cryptic plasmid from Streptococcus ferus. Recombinant plasmids could be recovered after transformation of S. sanguis (Challis) with these preparations. Three useful chimeras were constructed. pVA680, 5.5 megadaltons in size, contained a single KpnI site into which passenger DNA may be spliced. pVA736, 5.0 megadaltons in size, contained single EcoRI, HindIII, and KpnI sites into which passenger DNA may be spliced. The EcoRI and KpnI sites of pVA736 may be used in combination with one another when ligating DNA into this plasmid. pVA738, 3.7 megadaltons in size, contained single HindIII and AvaI sites into which passenger DNA may be spliced. pVA680, pVA736, and pVA738 were stably maintained as multicopy plasmids in S. sanguis (Challis). None of them continued to replicate (amplify) in chloramphenicol-treated cells. By using pVA736 as a vector, we have cloned a chloramphenicol resistance determinant obtained from a large, conjugative streptococcal R plasmid. In addition, chromosomal DNA sequences from Streptococcus mutans have been inserted into pVA736 by using the KpnI-EcoRI site combination.
TI  - Bacterial interference of Neisseria gonorrhoeae by alpha-haemolytic streptococci.
AB  - Fifty pharyngeal isolates of alpha-haemolytic streptococci were tested against 20 cervical isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae for bacterial interference in vitro using the lawn-spotting method. Forty-seven (94%) isolates of streptococci showed inhibitory activity toward N gonorrhoeae, although nine of these were inhibitory to only one isolate of N gonorrhoeae. Isolates of N gonorrhoeae varied widely in their sensitivity to streptococci; the most sensitive were inhibited by 40 isolates of streptococci and the least sensitive by only 14 isolates. Species of Streptococcus found to inhibit growth of N gonorrhoeae were S mitis, S MG intermedius, S sanguis II, S mutans, and S morbillorum.
TI  - Role of bacterial interactions in the colonization of oral surfaces of Actinomyces viscosus.
AB  - The effects of several microbial residents of human oral cavities on the attachment of Actinomyces viscosus T14V to tooth surfaces were assessed by using the saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sHA) in vitro system. Attachment to sHA by A. viscosus T14V was not inhibited in the presence of Streptococcus mutans GS5, either in the presence or absence of sucrose. Precoating sHA beads with S. mutans in the presence of sucrose also did not retard strain T14V attachment. However, the presence of Streptococcus sanguis M5 during strain T14V attachment markedly inhibited the interaction of A. viscosus T14V with sHA, whereas another S. sanguis strain, strain G9B, produced relatively weak inhibition. The inhibitory effect of S. sanguis M5 appeared to result from the direct interaction of this organism with A. viscosus T14V. Conversely, the presence of strain T14V markedly increased the attachment of S. sanguis M5 to sHA while partially inhibiting the attachment of S. sanguis G9B. Moreover, sHA beads precoated with A. viscosus T14V bound much higher levels of S. sanguis M5 relative to uncoated sHA, whereas S. sanguis G9B attachment was only weakly inhibited. It was also observed that sHA beads precoated with either S. sanguis M5 or G9B inhibited subsequent attachment by strain T14V. These results suggest the possibility that the attachment sites for both S. sanguis strains partially overlap those for A. viscosus T14V. Streptococcus mitis weakly inhibited attachment of strain T14V to sHA, and both Streptococcus salivarius and Lactobacillus casei had little effect on attachment. In addition, both a radioisotope attachment assay and fluorescent microscopy demonstrated no significant attachment of A. viscosus T14V to human epithelial cells.
TI  - Effects of molecular weight of dextran on the adherence of Streptococcus sanguis  to damaged heart valves.
AB  - Dextran-producing streptococci such as Streptococcus sanguis are the organisms most frequently associated with infective endocarditis in humans. A series of experiments was designed to study how the molecular weight of dextrans affects the adherence of an endocarditis strain of S. sanguis to canine heart valves covered with platelets and fibrin. The data indicated that this adherence was dependent on dextrans of high molecular weight, such as dextran T-2000 or glucans isolated from S. sanguis or S. mutans. The adherence properties of the strain studied were not modified by prior exposure of the bacterial cells of valve leaflets to high-molecular-weight dextrans. Preexposure of bacterial cells or valve leaflets to low-molecular-weight dextrans decreased their adherence. Low-molecular-weight dextrans interfered with adherence of dextran-positive strains to damaged heart valves.
TI  - Distribution of cross-reactive antigens A and B in Streptococcus mutans and other oral streptococci.
AB  - A collection of strains representing the various common species of oral streptococci was examined for the presence of antigens cross-reacting with A and B from Streptococcus mutans serotype c. Antigens cross-reacting with A were found only in S. mutans serotype b. Antigens cross-reacting with B were found in S. mutans serotypes a, c, d, e, f and g and also in strains of S. sanguis. All antigens cross-reacting with B were precipitated by antiserum to human heart tissue.
TI  - Microflora and chemical composition of dental plaque from subjects with hereditary fructose intolerance.
AB  - We compared the microbiological and chemical composition of dental plaque from subjects with hereditary fructose intolerance who restrict their dietary sugar intake with that of control subjects who do not. The two groups showed no significant differences in chemical composition of plaque: the mean protein, carbohydrate, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate contents were similar. Dental plaque from both groups contained similar numbers of total colony-forming units per microgram of plaque protein, and Streptococcus sanguis, an indigenous nonpathogen, was isolated with equal frequency from plaque samples of both groups. However, potentially odontopathic Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus were isolated three to four times more frequently from plaque samples of control subjects than from plaque samples of subjects with hereditary fructose intolerance. Clearly, diet (sucrose in particular) influences the colonization and multiplication of specific cariogenic organisms in dental plaque.
TI  - Genetic transformation of Streptococcus sanguis (Challis) with cryptic plasmids from Streptococcus ferus.
AB  - By using the basic methodology initially published by Kretschmer et al. (J. Bacteriol. 124:225-231, 1975), we have been able to introduce phenotypically cryptic plasmids from Streptococcus ferus (formerly Streptococcus mutans subsp. ferus) into Streptococcus sanguis by genetic transformation. In this system, the entry of the cryptic plasmids is selected indirectly. This is effected with transforming deoxyribonucleic acid mixtures in which the cryptic plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid is present in an approximate 10-fold molar excess with respect to a plasmid (pVA1) known to confer erythromycin resistance. Under such conditions, 5 to 10% of the pVA1-containing erythromycin-resistant transformants were cotransformed with cryptic plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid. pVA1 may be selectively eliminated by growth of its S. sanguis host strain at 42 degrees C, enabling the construction of isogenic strains with and without S. ferus cryptic plasmids. Comparative physiological studies of such strains have failed to reveal any plasmid-conferred phenotypes in S. sanguis. With this procedure, we have been able to physically separate two small cryptic plasmids (2.4 x 10(6) and 2.8 x 10(6) daltons) of S. ferus. Although these plasmids were found naturally to exist in a single S. ferus host, they were able to replicate independently of one another in S. sanguis. Restriction enzyme fingerprinting indicated that these plasmids did not share a common ancestry.
TI  - Simple method for demonstrating small plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid molecules in  oral streptococci.
AB  - A simple procedure for rapidly demonstrating small plasmids (less than 10 megadaltons) in oral streptococci is described. Logarithmic-phase, glycine-treated cells from 1.5-ml broth cultures were converted to osmotically fragile forms and lysed with sodium dodecyl sulfate. After the hydrodynamic shearing of host chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid, such lysates were analyzed by low-voltage agarose gel electrophoresis. Small plasmids, migrating significantly faster than chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid under such conditions, were readily visualized by ethidium bromide staining.
TI  - Conservation of cell wall peptidoglycan by strains of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - Turnover of the cell wall peptidoglycan fraction of six different strains of Streptococcus mutans and eight different strains of Streptococcus sanguis was examined. Cells were grown in the presence of [3H]lysine and [14C]leucine for at least eight generations and then chased in growth medium lacking the two labels. At intervals during the chase, samples of cultures were removed, and the amounts of the two labeled precursors remaining in the peptidoglycan and protein fractions were quantitated. Similar experiments were done in which the pulse-labeling technique was used. In addition, cells were labeled in the presence of tetracycline or penicillin, chased with growth medium containing no inhibitor, and assayed at intervals during the chase for the amount of [3H]lysine present in peptidoglycan fractions. Studies of cultures of S. mutans strains FA-1, OMZ-61, OMZ-176, 6715, GS-5, and Ingbritt and of S. sanguis strains 10558, M-5, Wicky, DL-101, DL-1, 71X26, and 71X48 maintained in the exponential phase of growth in a chemically defined medium failed to show evidence of loss of insoluble peptidoglycan via turnover. Similarly, for the strains of S. mutans, insoluble peptidoglycan assembled during 2 h of benzylpenicillin or tetracycline treatment was also conserved during recovery from growth inhibition.
TI  - Electron microscopic visualization of extracellular polysaccharides on the cell wall of some streptococci.
AB  - The thickness of the acid polysaccharide capsule varied remarkably among the studied streptococci. In some strains, projections of the capsule and sloughing of the polysaccharide were observed in the medium.
TI  - Establishment of potentially cariogenic streptococci in an experimental human plaque. I: Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans (Streptomycin resistant) was seeded to enamel slabs in the Intraoral Cariogenicity Test (ICT). After seven days in vivo, S. mutans comprised 58% of the total streptococci in the seeded plaque, compared to approximately 1% for the non-seeded control plaque. Seeding S. mutans to the ICT resulted in a change in the proportion of total streptococci in plaques, but no difference in ICT caries compared to control slabs was recorded.
TI  - Binding of streptococcal antigens to muscle tissue in vitro.
AB  - Antigens extracted from cells of Streptococcus pyogenes T6 and Streptococcus mutans strains AHT, BHT, 10449, OMZ175, and K1R adsorbed to the sarcolemmal sheath of cardiac muscle cells in vitro. Similar preparations from S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Lactobacillus casei had weak or negligible tissue-binding activity. Tissue-bound bacterial antigens were detected with homologous rabbit antisera with both indirect immunofluorescence tests and an indirect radioimmunoassay. Serological cross-reactivity was observed between the tissue-binding factors of S. pyogenes and S. mutans cells but not between the bacteria and muscle tissue. In a comparative study of extraction procedures, the greatest yield of tissue-binding factors was obtained from group A streptococci by cell disruption in buffer at 4 degrees C. Hot aqueous phenol and hot water extracts were inactive. Antibodies specific for the tissue-binding factor(s) were readily adsorbed from rabbit anti-S. pyogenes serum by a preparation of isolated cytoplasmic membranes but not by a suspension of cell wall fragments. The heart-binding component of S. pyogenes cell extracts was inactivated by protease digestion and heat treatment and to a lesser extent by periodic acid oxidation. The capacity of heart cell components to adsorb streptococcal antigens was reduced by protease treatment but not by the action of neuraminidase, hyaluronidase, organic solvents, or detergents.
TI  - Effects of chlorhexidine and iodine on in vitro plaques of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - Both chlorhexidine and iodine showed greater antimicrobial effect on in vitro grown S. mutans plaque than on plaque composed of S. sanguis. One treatment with iodine for 8 min inhibited the acid production of S. Mutans plaque whereas S. sanguis plaque required 20 min to be similarly affected. In contrast one treatment with chlorhexidine for up to 20 min did not completely inhibit the acid production of plaque of either microorganism. Repeated short term exposures increased the bactericidal effect of chlorhexidine but not that of iodine. The difference in antimicrobial effect between chlorhexidine and that of iodine on S. mutans and S. sanguis should be investigated in persons heavily infected by S. mutans.
TI  - Adherence of oral streptococci to keratinized and nonkeratinized human oral epithelial cells.
AB  - The ability of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis,  and Streptococcus salivarius to adhere to keratinized versus nonkeratinized human oral epithelial cells was compared. S. mitis and S. salivarius exhibited significantly greater adherence to keratinized cells than to nonkeratinized cells. S. mutans and S. sanguis adhered equally well to either epithelial cell type. It is concluded that keratinization of epithelial cells may be a significant factor in the adherence of certain oral streptococci to the oral mucosa.
TI  - The effects of fluoride on the growth of oral streptococci.
AB  - Four species of oral streptococci were examined for their ability to grow in a complex medium supplemented with NaF, and at various pH levels. Streptococcus mutans strains were the most susceptible to inhibition, with Streptococcus mitior and Streptococcus sanguis being the least affected. The S. mutans genotype comprising serotypes c, e and f was more susceptible to inhibition by fluoride than was the genotype comprising serotypes d and g. The results suggest that the fluoride concentration of dental plaque might influence the relative proportions of the species of streptococci found in dental plaque.
TI  - Manganese antagonizes the inhibitory effect of fluoride on the glucose metabolism of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Manganese stimulated the utilization of glucose by Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitior and Streptococcus milleri. S. mutans serotype c strains formed larger amounts of intracellular polysaccharide, lactic acid and produced a lower terminal pH in glucose broth when grown in the presence of 0.5 mM Mn. Manganese stimulated the utilization of glucose by resting cell suspensions of each of the four oral streptococcal species examined. Fluoride inhibited the utilization of glucose by the streptococci and Mn, but not calcium or magnesium, was found to counteract the inhibitory effect of fluoride.

TI  - An in vitro model for studying adsorption of oral streptococci to crown and bridge cements.
AB  - A sensitive, in vitro method has been developed for the study of bacterial adsorption to dental crown and bridge cements. The method employs heavily radiolabelled cells which adhere to the wall in wells made from the cements. Loss of radioactivity from the bacterial suspension during incubation is used to measure the degree of bacterial adherence to the materials. Strains of Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mutans adhered in greater numbers than a strain of Streptococcus salivarius to both a zinc phosphate cement and a zinc carboxylate cement. The zinc phosphate cement supported adherence to a greater degree than did the zinc carboxylate cement. Pretreatment of the cement surfaces with human saliva tended to reduce bacterial adherence. Pretreatment of the bacteria with saliva slightly enhanced sorption of S. sanguis and S. salivarius, but tended to impair sorption of S. mutans to both types of cements. When both bacteria and cements had been pretreated with saliva, a strong inhibition of the adherence of S. mutans was observed.
TI  - Rate-limiting steps of the glycolytic pathway in the oral bacteria Streptococcus  mutans and Streptococcus sanguis and the influence of acidic pH on the glucose metabolism.
AB  
TI  - The epidemiology of dental caries and periodontal disease.
AB  - Dental caries and periodontal disease are common in industrialized countries and  caries is increasing in non-industrialized countries. The predominant method of coping with the disease problem has been to treat rather than prevent the diseases, an approach which has obviously failed to cope with the problem as shown by the results of the International Collaborative Study of Dental Manpower Systems (58). Epidemiological evidence suggests that a food policy directed at lowering the refined sugar consumption level to about 10 kg per person per year in conjunction with fluoride supplementation of the diet would virtually eliminate dental caries in industrialized countries. Health education to improve the effectiveness of toothbrushing will reduce the progression of periodontal disease to a rate compatible with keeping teeth for a life-time.
TI  - Longitudinal investigation of the role of Streptococcus mutans in human fissure decay.
AB  - A prospective study was initiated in order to detect changes in the levels and proportions of Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, and lactobacilli before and at the time of caries development on occlusal fissures. The bacteriological analysis was performed on 195 teeth that received four examinations at approximately 6-month intervals. The data obtained from 42 carious fissures and 153 caries-free fissures strongly indicated an etiological role for S. mutans in most of the diagnosed fissure lesions. This was demonstrated by the longitudinal analysis, which showed the proportions of S. mutans to increase significantly at the time of caries diagnosis, and by cross-sectional comparisons, which showed that the proportions of S. mutans in the carious fissures were significantly higher than in caries-free fissures. Three subjects who had a low caries expereince developed five new carious lesions. Lactobacilli were prominent members of the caries-associated flora in these subjects greatly outnumbering S. mutans. The levels and proportions of S. sanguis tended to be higher in the caries-free fissures. Altho1gh the results are striking in that they implicate S. mutans in fissure decay, they show that clinical decay can occur in a few instances in the absence of detectable S. mutans, as was observed in the fissures high in lactobacilli.
TI  - Differential utilization of proteins in saliva from caries-active and caries-free subjects as growth substrates by plaque-forming streptococci.
AB  - Mixed or parotid saliva from caries-active individuals consistently supported better growth of Streptococcus mutans (type c) than that from caries-free individuals. Electrophoretic studies revealed that certain proteins in caries-active salivas were susceptible to microbial attack, but similar proteins in caries-free salivas were refractory.

TI  - In vitro studies of dental plaque formation: adsorption of oral streptococci to hydroxyaptite.
AB  - A mixture of saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads and radioactively labeled bacteria has been employed as an in vitro model for the initial phase of dental plaque formation. Adsorption in this model can be expressed by the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, and the adherence of oral streptococci can be expressed as the product of the affinity constant (Ka) and the number of binding sites (N), KaN. With this approach, Streptococcus sanguis serotype 1 strains adhered better (KaN = [187 +/- 72] X 10(-2)) than serotype 2 strains (KaN = [97 +/- 84] X 10(-2)); a t test showed this difference to be statistically significant to the 99.99% confidence level. Strains of S. mitis, S. mutans, and S. salivarius did not appear to adhere as well. To analyze the bacterial receptors involved in adherence, competition studies in which increasing quantities of unlabeled bacteria were added to a fixed quantity (4 X 10(9) cells per ml) of 3H-labeled serotype 1, reference strain S. sanguis G9B, were performed. These studies indicated that the type 1 strains competed for the same, or closely related, binding sites. Competition studies using serotype 2 S. sanguis strains resulted in an increased binding of reference strain G9B to hydroxyapatite. Scanning electron microscopy indicated this effect was due to the formation of localized aggregations of bacteria, presumably representing the two bacterial types. The results of competition studies with S. mitis were variable, and several strains of other oral bacteria showed little or no competition.
TI  - Effects of bactericidal treatments on bacterial adherence and dental plaque formation.
AB  - In vivo plaque formation was significantly reduced when tooth surfaces were subjected to topical applications of iodine (0.2% I2 in 2.0% KI) twice daily for 3 d. Similarly, in vivo plaque formation was significantly reduced on enamel surfaces that were subjected to ultraviolet irradiation. Control experiments indicated that neither ultraviolet irradiation nor iodine treatment interfered with mechanisms for bacterial apposition to dental plaque. The results are interpreted to suggest that plaque grows in mass primarily by the division and multiplication in situ by plaque bacteria, not by a continued apposition of salivary microbes.
TI  - Effect of chlorhexidine on the relative proportions of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis in hamster plaque.
AB  - The effect of chlorhexidine on the proportions of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis in plaque was studied in hamsters fed a diet containing 28% sucrose. In animals given chlorhexidine in their drinking water for 10 d a decrease in the population of S. mutans and an increase of S. sanguis occurred in the plaque. Following the removal of chlorhexidine the population of S. mutans increased again in the presence of sucrose and the number of S. sanguis returned to initial values. When animals were given a sucrose-free diet the low proportion of S. mutans observed following the short-term chlorhexidine period persisted. These data indicate that there is an inverse relationship between the number of S. sanguis and S. mutans in plaque and that the sensitivity in vivo of S. mutans to chlorheximide can be used to suppress the population of S. mutans with a concomitant rise in the proportion of S. sanguis.
TI  - Serologic studies of Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus constellatus, and Streptococcus morbillorum by crossed immunoelectrophoresis.
AB  - A reference antigen-antibody system for Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus  constellatus, and Streptococcus morbillorum was established with crossed immunoelectrophoresis. A comparison of S. intermedius, S. constellatus, and S. morbillorum with crossed immunoelectrophoresis and crossed immunoelectrophoresis with intermediate gel indicated that S. intermedius and S. constellatus are closely related antigenically with as many as six common cytoplasmic antigens. S. morbillorum was antigenically more distinct; antiserum of one strain of S. morbillorum was monospecific, indicating that specific serogroups of S. morbillorum exist. Crossed immunoelectrophoresis and tandem crossed immunoelectrophoresis revealed that S. intermedius, S. constellatus, and S. morbillorum also share some common antigens with Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mitis, but S. intermedius, S. constellatus, and S. morbillorum are antigenically distinct from Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus bovis.

AB  
TI  - Interactions between human serum proteins and oral streptococci reveal occurrence of receptors for aggregated beta 2-microglobulin.
AB  - A total of 31 strains of oral streptococci representing Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitior, Streptococcus salivarius, and Streptococcus milleri were tested for possible binding of human immunoglobulins G, G1, G2, G3, G4, A1, A2, M1, and M2 and haptoglobin, hemoglobin, fibrinogen, and aggregated beta 2-microglobulin. Radiolabeled beta 2-microglobulin in aggregated form showed affinity for 20 of the 31 strains tested. Binding activity for the protein was found in strains belonging to all five species. The bacterial receptor was resistant to trypsin. Monomeric, unlabeled beta 2-microglobulin did not interfere with the binding of the aggregated form. Of the other proteins tested, only the immunoglobulin A1 protein showed positive binding, and that was only with a single strain of S. milleri. beta 2-Microglobulin is present on all nucleated cell membranes in vivo. The reaction between aggregated beta 2-microglobulin and oral streptococci is a new type of human-bacterium interaction which should be considered in studies of bacterial adherence.
TI  - Specificity of coaggregation reactions between human oral streptococci and strains of Actinomyces viscosus or Actinomyces naeslundii.
AB  - Coaggregation reactions between actinomycete and streptococcal cells occurred frequently when human strains of Actinomyces viscosus or A. naeslundii were mixed with human isolates of Streptococcus sanguis or S. mitis, but were infrequent with other oral actinomycetes and streptococci. Two groups of actinomycetes and four groups of streptococci were defined by the patterns of their coaggregation reactions and by the ability of beta-linked galactosides (i.e., lactose) to reverse these reactions. Coaggregations occurred by one of the following three kinds to cell-cell interactions: (i) coaggregation that was blocked by heating the streptococcus but not the actinomycete and was not reversed by lactose; (ii) coaggregation that was blocked by heating the actinomycete but not the streptococcus and was reversed by lactose; and (iii) coaggregation that was blocked only by heating both cell types. The latter reaction was a combination of the first two since lactose reversed coaggregation between heated streptococci and unheated actinomycetes but did not reverse coaggregations between unheated streptococci and heated actinomycetes. Cells that could be heat inactivated also were inactivated by amino group acetylation or protease digestion, whereas cells that were unaffected by heat were not inactivated by these treatments. Coaggregation reactions of each kind were Ca2+ dependent and insensitive to dextranase treatment. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that human strains of A. viscosus and A. naeslundii coaggregate with strains of S. sanguis and S. mitis by a system of specific cell surface interactions between protein or glycoprotein receptors on one cell type and carbohydrates on the other type.
TI  - [Persistency and resistance of streptococci isolated from periodontal pockets].
AB  - Intradermal injection of cell walls or cell wall constituents (Peptidoglycane) of Streptococcus sanguis II in experimental animals caused a similarly severe inflammatory reaction as with Streptococcus A. The three "viridans" species of streptococci proved to be resistant to complement (active serum) as well as to lysozyme and were superior to Streptococcus A in their capacity for resistance to another type of muralytic enzyme isolated from Streptomyces albus. The new acylureido penicillins (Mezlocillin, Azlocillin) had an almost equally inhibitory effect on the growth of the various species of bacteria. The "viridans" and beta-haemolytic types of streptococci which induce a chemotactic reaction in vitro were about equally rapidly and effectively killed in the phagocytes (granulocytes, monocytes) isolated from a patient.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of seven cationic detergents as antiplaque agents.
AB  - The bactericidal efficacy of seven cationic detergents was studied in vitro against intact performed plaques of representative strains of four oral dental plaque-forming microorganisms: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus, and Actinomyces naeslundii. Both absolute (plaque bactericidal index) and relative (chlorhexidine coefficient) indexes of antiplaque activity were established. Only cetyltrimethylammonium bromide was more efficacious than the reference agent, the bisbiguanide chlorhexidine, for the apparently more potent tooth-adherent cariogenic and periodontopathic elements, respectively, of the in vivo plaque microflora, S. mutans and A. viscosus.
TI  - Stability of the resident microflora and the bacteriocinogeny of Streptococcus mutans as factors affecting its establishment in specific pathogen-free rats.
AB  - The outcome of the experimental implantation of Streptococcus mutans strains in humans and animals is unpredictable, and neither success nor failure can be explained. It seems logical to assume that, apart from dietary and host factors, the characteristics of the S. mutans strain involved and those of the resident plaque microflora are important in colonization. For example, previous work in this laboratory suggested that bacteriocin production accounts at least in part for the establishment of an invading bacterium in a microbial ecosystem. In the present study, a complex specific pathogen-free Ny plaque ecosystem was obtained by the inoculation of specific pathogen-free rats with Actinomyces viscosus Ny1 and S. sanguis Ny101, and the establishment of S. mutans in such rats was then examined. It was found that bacteriocinogenic (bac(+)) strains generally colonized in much higher proportions than non-bacteriocinogenic (bac(-)) strains. Moreover, the longer the delay in introducing S. mutans, the poorer was its establishment. Shortly after inoculation of strains Ny1 and Ny101, there is probably a transient state in which microbial equilibrium has not been reached, but later the specific pathogen-free Ny system attains a stable climax community which more strongly resists invaders. The ability of a number of S. mutans strains to establish in such a climax community was then examined, and it was found that bac(+) strains generally established at a higher level than did bac(-) strains. In summary, it was concluded that, although the bac(+) state is an important property in the successful invasion of a plaque by S. mutans, the stability of the resident microflora is also an important factor.
TI  - Factors affecting adhesion of bacterial to a tooth in vitro.
AB  - The initial adhesion of oral bacteria to a tooth in vitro was examined. The organisms were grown in broth with and without sucrose, and suspensions made either in broth or a modified Ringer's solution. The tooth used was either dry or coated with natural or synthetic saliva. Adhesion was determined by counting organisms removed from the tooth surface by simple washing or by sonication. It was found that the firmest bonding occurred when a dry tooth was immersed in a suspension of bacteria in Ringer's solution; the prior growth of the organisms in the presence of sucrose did not affect adhesion. It was concluded that instantaneous irreversible adhesion of bacteria to a tooth occurs without the need for active metabolism, and that this process is inhibited by the presence of competing organic substances which probably produce a surface-conditioning film.

TI  - Bacterial and strain specificities in opsonization, phagocytosis and killing of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Opsonization of Streptococcus mutans, followed by phagocytosis and killing by polymorphonuclear leucocytes has been postulated as an effector mechanism in protection against dental caries. Opsonization was studied by using sera from monkeys immunized with killed Strep. mutans (sero-type c) and compared with sera from sham-immunized monkeys. Antibodies to Strep. mutans (sero-type c) induced maximal phagocytosis and killing of serotypes c and e, and this was significantly greater than with serotypes a and d; there was no significant phagocytosis or killing of serotype b. There was little or no opsonization with Actinomyces viscosus, Lactobacillus casei, Strep, sanguis and Strep. salivarius. The exception was Strep. CHT which showed significant phagocytosis and killing. The results suggest that immunization with the serotype c strain of Strep. mutans might offer protection against four of the five common serotypes of this organism.

TI  - Selective binding of blood group-reactive salivary mucins by Streptococcus mutans and other oral organisms.
AB  - Strains of Streptococcus mutans of four genetic groups and five serotypes, and strains of S. sanguis, S. mitis, S. salivarius, Actinomyces naeslundii, and A. viscosus, were found to bind blood group-reactive (BGR) mucin isolated from whole human saliva. The bacteria studied bound mucins with blood type A or B reactivity to a similar extent, suggesting that the carbohydrate moieties responsible for the A and B antigenic determinants were not involved. The organisms studied appeared to bind different fractions of BGR mucin molecules because preparations absorbed with cells of a given oral species no longer contained BGR molecules which bound to homologous organisms but still possessed BGR components which bound to varying degrees to other bacteria. Differences were even noted among S. mutans strains belonging to different genetic groups and serological types. Immunoglobulins could not be detected in the mucin preparations, and addition of anti-human immunoglobulin A (IgA), IgG, or IgM serum to reaction mixtures did not affect binding. Mucin pretreated with periodate or iodoacetate no longer bound to S. mutans H12 cells, suggesting that carbohydrate moieties and sulfhydryl groups played an essential role. Active cell metabolism was not required for BGR mucin binding; however, pretreatment of H12 cells with periodate or heat (100 degrees C for 15 min) reduced binding. Mucin labeled with [(14)C]phenyl isothiocyanate appeared to bind to S. mutans H12 cells comparably to untreated mucin; the binding also appeared to be specific because less than 15% of the labeled material became bound when incubated with an excess of streptococci. Binding of [(14)C]phenyl isothiocyanate-labeled mucin was not affected by neutral sugars tested or by preparations of c antigen, glycerol teichoic acid, dextran, or crude glucosyltransferase. However, binding was inhibited by several amines. BGR salivary mucins are present in the acquired pellicle covering teeth; the ability of bacteria to selectively bind such components suggest that they may serve as receptor molecules involved in the attachment of bacteria to teeth.
TI  - Salivary agglutinin and secretory IgA reactions with oral streptococci.
AB  - S. mutans, S. salivarius, S. mitis and S. sanguis strains were isolated from three subjects of blood groups A, B and O. Parotid saliva samples obtained from the same subjects induced aggregation of some of the bacteria, the S. sanguis and the S. mutans strains in particular. While parotid saliva from the three subjects gave almost identical reactions, slight interindividual differences were observed for a few strains with the submandibular sublingual salivas. In parotid saliva, secretory antibodies reacting with all strains were present. The antibody levels differed between the three subjects but no specific pattern was observed when homologous strains were compared with heterologous strains.
TI  - Co-induction of beta-galactosidase and the lactose-P-enolpyruvate phosphotransferase system in Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The addition of lactose, galactose, or isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) to glucose-grown cells of Streptococcus salivarius 25975 resulted in the co-induction of both the lactose-P-enolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (lactose-PTS) and beta-galactosidase, with the latter the predominant metabolic system. With various strains of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis 10556, on the other hand, the lactose-PTS was the major metabolic pathway with beta-galactosidase induced either to low or negligible levels. In all cases, induction of the lactose-PTS resulted in the concomitant induction of 6-P-beta-galactosidase. The induction by lactose of both the lactose-PTS and beta-galactosidase in all strains was repressed by glucose and other catabolites, notably, fructose. Induction of beta-galactosidase in S. salivarius 25975 by IPTG was, however, relatively resistant to glucose repression. Induction experiments with IPTG and lactose suggested that a cellular metabolite of lactose metabolism was a repressor of enzyme activity. Exogenous cAMP was shown to reverse the transient repression by glucose of beta-galactosidase induction in cells of S. salivarius 25975 receiving lactose, provided the cells were grown with small amounts of toluene to overcome the permeability barrier to this nucleotide, cAMP, was however, unable to overcome the permanent repression of beta-galactosidase activity to a significant extent under these conditions.

AB  - It has been asserted that humoral immunity is an important potentiating factor in pathogenesis of infective endocarditis, in that prior immunization to certain bacteria may predispose the host to endocarditis caused by those organisms. If so, possible future vaccination of humans with streptococcal antigens for the prevention of dental caries might increase the susceptibility of the population to streptococcal endocarditis. To examine this hypothesis further, we immunized rabbits with killed Streptococcus sanguis or Streptococcus mutans. After complement-fixing antibody had developed, the rabbits were tested for susceptibility to experimental infective endocarditis. Rabbits with high titers of complement-fixing antibody to the infecting organism developed streptococcal endocarditis less often (13%) than animals with lower titers (69%; P less than 0.0002). These findings do not support the hypothesis that pre-immunization predisposes to infective endocarditis and lend no credence to the concept that vaccination of human subjects against dental caries might increase their susceptibility to streptococcal endocarditis. On the contrary, the results of these experiments indicate that specific antibody can confer relative immunity to infective endocarditis.
TI  - Adherence of glucan-positive and glucan-negative streptococcal strains to normal  and damaged heart valves.
AB  - The adherence of 18 strains of streptococci to sections of normal canine and human aortic, mitral, and tricuspid valves and to canine interatrial septum was compared in an in vitro system. Quantitative measurements of adherence ratios were performed by two independent methods. Adherence ratios for Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, S. bovis, and Group D streptococci were higher (0.0058-0.0101) than for the other streptococcal strains studied (0.0025-0.0041). With the exception of Group D streptococci, adherence ratios for each bacterial strain were similar with the aortic, mitral, and tricuspid valve sections. Adherence ratios with normal human and canine valve leaflets were similar, but adherence ratios with interatrial septum were lower than with normal valve sections. Adherence ratios for glucan-positive and glucan-negative strains of streptococci with normal and with damaged aortic valve leaflets were also compared. The adherence ratios of the glucan-positive streptococci (S. mutans, S. sanguis, and S. bovis) and one glucan-negative enterococcal strain (KG-3) were approximately five times higher with damaged aortic valves (0.039-0.051) than with normal aortic valves (0.009-0.010). For glucan-positive strains, adherence ratios with normal aortic leaflets were similar when bacteria were grown in media which contains or lacks sucrose. In striking contrast, growth of the glucan-positive strains in medium which lacks sucrose, with resultant deficiency of glucan production, decreased the adherence ratios with damaged aortic valve leaflets to those found with normal aortic leaflets. Treatment of glucan-positive strains with dextranase resulted in a decrease in their adherence ratios to levels seen with bacteria grown in medium lacking sucrose, but the higher adherence ratios could be restored in the presence of exogenous dextran.It is concluded that glucan production is one quantitatively important factor that contributes to the greater adherence of glucan-positive streptococci to damaged rather than to normal aortic heart valve leaflets. However, glucan production is not the only factor that determines preferential adherence of streptococci to damaged heart valves, because glucan-negative strains may also show some degree of increased adherence to damaged valves. Thus, bacterial glucan production is one of the factors that could contribute to the pathogenesis of bacterial endocarditis.
TI  - The viability of microorganisms in carious lesions five years after covering with a fissure sealant.
AB  - Carious lesions that were covered with a pit and fissure sealant for five years yielded bacterial cultures that were predominantly negative. Sixteen of 18 test sites judged to have active caries in 1972 were found inactive in 1977; ten of 12 sites suspected to have caries in 1972 were deemed to have inactive caries in 1977. Sealant treatment resulted in an apparent 89% reversal from a caries-active to a caries-inactive state. These data confirm and extend previous observations that a limited number of cultivable organisms persist in some lesions but their numbers are few, and they do not appear capable of continuing the destruction of tooth structure.
TI  - Factors affecting the aggregation of Actinomyces naeslundii during growth and in  washed cell suspensions.
AB  - Various factors affecting the aggregation of Actinomyces naeslundii strain 12104  were studied. When the pH of glucose-supplemented growth medium fell below 5.5, the cells aggregated and formed microbial masses which tenaciously adhered to the culture vessels. When the organism was cultured in the same medium in the absence of glucose, maximum growth was reduced and the final culture pH values remained above 6.5, but the cells were more dispersed and nonadherent. Adjusting the final pH of these cultures to below 5.5 with HCl caused the cells to aggregate. Cells from unsupplemented cultures with final pH values of 6.7 were washed by centrifugation, dispersed by vigorous shaking, and suspended in buffer at pH values ranging from 4.5 to 8.0. Aggregation (expressed as the percent reduction of optical density at 520 nm after incubation at 37 degrees C) occurred rapidly at pH values below 6.0 but did not readily occur at higher pH values. Aggregation of strain 12104 in washed cell suspensions was induced by low pH and influenced by cell concentration and ionic strength of the environment. Low pH values also induced aggregation in washed cell suspensions of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, and Actinomyces viscosus.
TI  - Dextran production as a possible virulence factor in streptococcal endocarditis.
AB  
TI  - Binding of glucosyltransferase and glucan synthesis by Streptococcus mutans and other bacteria.
AB  - Lyophilized and heat-treated cells from the seven serotypes of Streptococcus mutans were examined for their ability to bind added insoluble-product glucosyl-transferase (GTase) and to synthesize cell-associated glucan from [(14)C]sucrose. Lyophilized cells of serotypes a and g did not synthesize any more additional glucan than did the controls after exposure to GTase. These cells, however, synthesized four- to eightfold-greater quantities of glucan than did the cells of the remaining serotypes. Lyophilized cells of serotypes b, c, d, e, and f synthesized two- to threefold-greater quantities of glucan after exposure to GTase than did the controls without added enzyme. Lyophilized cells of serotypes a and g synthesized 6- to 10-fold-greater quantities of glucan than did heat-treated cells of the same strain after binding of GTase. Lyophilized cells of the remaining serotypes synthesized only 1.6- to 3.3-fold-greater quantities of glucan than did the heat-treated cells. These results demonstrate that heat treatment to inactivate cell-associated GTase does not create additional GTase binding sites in S. mutans and that serotypes a and g are considerably more active in cell-associated glucan synthesis than cells of the other five serotypes. Ten species of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria from five genera which do not produce in vitro plaque synthesized 10- to 100-fold-less glucan than did the S. mutans strains after exposure to GTase. Of these species, S. sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus, and A. naeslundii synthesized the largest quantities of glucan. Three mutant strains of S. mutans which possess a reduced ability for in vitro adherence but do agglutinate with glucan or dextran synthesized only one-third as much glucan after binding of GTase as the control. These results are discussed in relation to in vitro and in vivo plaque development and the agglutination of S. mutans. The results support earlier findings which indicate that the presence of bacterial species other than S. mutans in smooth-surface dental plaque is due in part to contact of the cells with glucan in the developing plaque and not to the binding of cell-free GTase and the in situ synthesis of glucan. The results obtained with these representative strains of the seven serotypes of S. mutans may not apply to the same extent to other strains within the serotypes.
TI  - "Conjugal" transfer of plasmid DNA among oral streptococci.
AB  - The beta plasmid from Streptococcus faecalis strain DS5, which codes for resistance to erythromycin and lincomycin, was introduced into a Lancefield group F streptococcus, strain DR1501, by transformation. This strain, DR1501 (beta), was found to be an excellent donor of the beta plasmid and readily transferred the resistance markers to various lactic acid bacteria, including certain strains of S. mutans, S. sanguis, and S. salivarius. Evidence is presented indicating that the transfer of the beta plasmid is mediated by a mechanism that requires cell-to-cell contact. The transfer of plasmid DNA during conjugation has been confirmed by the isolation of beta plasmid from transconjugant clones and by their ability to then serve as donors of the erythromycin and lincomycin resistance markers.
TI  - Activity of three 8-hydroxyquinoline derivatives against in vitro dental plaque.
AB  - Three 8-hydroxyquinoline derivatives, assessed using an in vitro preformed dental plaque model system, were differentially inhibitory for four plaque-forming microorganisms.
TI  - Use of extractable adenosine triphosphate to estimate the viable cell mass in dental plaque samples obtained from monkeys.
AB  - The viable cell mass in plaque samples obtained from monkeys was estimated by determining the concentration of extractable adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and total cell mass was estimated by measuring the protein content. The results were expressed in terms of the specific ATP and protein contents of Streptococcus sanguis. The viable counts estimated by these techniques were comparable to or exceeded viable counts obtained by other investigators using conventional bacteriological methods.
TI  - Comparative estimates of bacterial affinities and adsorption sites on hydroxyapatite surfaces.
AB  - The adsorption of strains of prominent oral bacteria to hydroxyapatite (HA) surfaces was studied by use of an adsorption model based on the Langmuir adsorption isotherm; this permitted comparative estimates of the number of adsorption sites and the strength of the adsorption bonds on untreated and salivatreated HA surfaces for strain of Streptococcus mutans, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. mitis, Actinomyces viscosus, and A. naeslundii. The experimental data closely followed the adsorption model as judged by the high correlation coefficients obtained for all strains studied. Adsorption to untreated HA was similar for strains of the six species studied, suggesting that a common adsorption mechanism, possibly Ca(2+) bridging, may exist for attachment to HA. More complex interactions appeared to be involved in bacterial adsorption to saliva-treated HA since adsorption of the strains tested at unsaturating cell concentrations varied more than 30-fold. This indicates that adsorbed salivary components on HA surfaces impart a higher order of specificity for subsequent bacterial adsorption. Fewer cells of strains of S. mutans, S. salivarius, and A. naeslundii adsorbed to saliva-treated HA than to untreated HA because adsorbed salivary components presented fewer adsorption sites. Substantially higher numbers of cells of strains of S. sanguis, S. mitis, and A. viscosus adsorbed to saliva-treated HA because the film of adsorbed salivary components increased the number of adsorption sites for these strains. The affinity constants for all but one strain studied were lower on saliva-treated HA than on untreated HA. The number of bacterial cells which adsorbed to saliva-treated HA more closely related to the number of available binding sites than to the strength of their adsorption bonds when tested at an initial concentration of 2 x 10(7) organisms/ml. Although some differences were observed in the adsorption of strains of S. mutans representative of five serological groups, the numbers which attached to saliva-treated HA did not vary widely; this suggests that factors other than their ability to attach to a pellicle-covered HA surface may be responsible for their varying geographic distribution in human populations.
TI  - Compounds which affect the adherence of Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mutans to hydroxyapatite.
AB  - Several compounds were evaluated in an in vitro assay system for their ability to block the adherence of Streptococcus sanguis to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite and Streptococcus mutans to dextran-coated hydroxyapatitite. Fatty acids, ranging from C-12 to C-20, the enzyme amylase, chlorhexidine, human sera, and several serum proteins blocked S sanguis adherence to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite. Chlorhexidine blocked S mutans adherence to dextran-coated hydroxyapatite, but human sera and serum proteins did not. The effects of these compounds on the adherence of these organisms to hydroxyapatite may help in the development of specific plaque control methods for use in human populations.
TI  - Salivary IgA antibodies to antigens from Streptococcus mutans in human dental caries.
AB  - 1) Subjects of low caries experience (DMF 7) had significantly lower IgA antibody titers to antigens from S. mutans serotype c than subjects of high caries experience (DMF 13). 2) Subjects with carious lesions and a high DMF had significantly lower salivary antibody titers than subjects without carious lesions. 3) Sequential studies revealed that in the absence of caries salivary antibody titers decreased over a 9 month period. 4) Treatment of caries was associated with a rise in salivary IgA antibodies. No significant changes were associated with the development of caries. 5) No relationship with caries experience was found with antibodies to S. mutans BHT (serotype b), S. sanguis OMZ-9 or S. mitis CHT. 6) The results do not support the hypothesis that salivary antibodies in man play a role in protection against caries.
TI  - Dental caries induction in experimental animals by clinical strains of Streptococcus mutans isolated from Japanese children.
AB  - Oral implantation and the cariogenic activity of clinical strains of Streptococcus mutans which had been isolated from Japanese children and labeled with streptomycin-resistance were examined in specific pathogen-free Sprague-Dawley rats. All the seven strains tested were easily implanted and persisted during the experimental period. Extensive carious lesions were produced in rats inoculated with clinical strains of S. mutans belonging to serotypes c, d, e, and f, and maintained on caries-inducing diet no. 2000. Noninfected rats did not develop dental caries when fed diet no. 2000. Type d S. mutans preferentially induced smooth surface caries in the rats. Strains of other serotypes primarily developed caries of pit and fissure origin. Caries also developed in rats inoculated with reference S. mutans strains BHTR and FAIR (type b) that had been maintained in the laboratories for many years. However, the cariogenicity of the laboratory strains was found to have decreased markedly. All three S. sanguis strains could be implanted, but only one strain induced definite fissure caries. Two S. salivarius strains could not be implanted well in the rats and therefore they were not cariogenic. Four different species of lactobacilli also failed to induce dental caries in rats subjected to similar caries test regimen on diet no. 200. S. mutans strain MT6R (type c) also induce caries in golden hamsters and ICR mice, but of variable degrees.
TI  - Cell-bound synthesis and subsequent adherence of oral streptococci due to the binding of extracellular glucosyltransferase to the streptococcal cell surface.
AB  
TI  - Discrimination between oral streptococci by pyrolysis gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - Washed organisms, including strains of Streptococcus mitior, S. mutans, and S. sanguis, were examined by curie-point pyrolysis gas-liquid chromatography. A linear discriminant function based upon three items from the output data was adequate for segregating the strains according to species. Strains with intermediate properties were also encountered. Sources of variability in cultures were evaluated, chromatographic performance was maintained throughout the investigation, and matching performance from a duplicate pair of chromatographic columns was demonstrated.
TI  - Specificity of salivary-bacterial interactions: role of terminal sialic acid residues in the interaction of salivary glycoproteins with Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Four highly purified salivary glycoproteins were used to study salivary-bacterial interactions. One pair of glycoproteins was mucin-like in composition, whereas the second pair was not. By an agglutination assay, it was found that only the mucin-glycoproteins agglutinated Streptococcus sanguis and S. mutans. Removal of sialic acid from these molecules resulted in a loss of agglutination of S. sanguis but not of S. mutans. The agglutination phenomenon was shown to require a salivary macromolecule of at least 150,000 daltons.

TI  - Streptococci and the human oral flora.
AB  
TI  - Genital occurrence of oral microbiota.
AB  - Recent studies indicate that tonsillar gonococcal infection or colonization is fairly common. Carriage rates of about 8% have been found. These studies also indicate that oro-genital contacts are common. Since very little is known about the amount of oral microbiota transmitted to the genitals, we have studied the occurrence of oral streptococci and Neisseria species in urethra and cervix. Among 128 patients attending an STD-clinic we found 10 carriers of oral streptococci, one Streptococcus mitior, four Streptococcus sanguis, one Streptococcus mutans and four Streptococcus salivarius and case of urethritis due to Neisseria menigitidis. Seventy-three of the patients had recently had their genitals exposed to the oral flora of their partners. Despite the heavy contamination with oral microbiota that can be assumed to occur in these cases, there seems to be no colonization of the genitals with oral microbiota.
TI  - Plaque formation in vitro by Actinomyces viscosus in the presence of Streptococcus sanguis or Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Actinomyces viscosus, growing on a tooth in the presence of sucrose, slowly produced a loosely-attached plaque, the pH being 6.1 after 120 h. When the tooth was inoculated simultaneously with A. viscosus and either Streptococcus sanguis or Streptococcus mutans, firmly-adherent plaque was quickly formed and the pH fell below 5 after 33 h with the former Streptococcus and 24 h with the latter. A. viscosus disappeared from each mixed plaque by 120 h.
TI  - Structural requirements of guanide, biguanide, and bisbiguanide agents for antiplaque activity.
AB  - The bactericidal efficacy of 16 guanide, biguanide, and bisbiguanide agents was studied in vitro against intact preformed plaques of four oral (plaque-forming) microorganisms: Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus, and A. naeslundii. The activities of these agents were examined in relation to their molecular configurations. These studies indicated that the bis- and biguanide configurations are important for efficacy, as is the length of the alkyl side chain. No structural moiety determined efficacy by itself. Furthermore, the activities of these agents were studied to determine the minimal conditions (concentration, duration, and frequency) of treatment required for likely clinical efficacy. At least six agents were judged to have equal or greater efficacy than the reference agent, chlorhexidine digluconate. A plaque bactericidal index was derived for the most potent agents, and comparison to the bactericidal properties of chlorhexidine was expressed as a chlorhexidine coefficient.
TI  - Binding of lectins to Streptococcus mutans cells and type-specific polysaccharides, and effect on adherence.
AB  - The lectin concanavalin A (Con A) agglutinated the cells of 13 of 15 strains of the seven serotypes of Streptococcus mutans in an 18-h incubation period. Strains of types a, d, f, and g agglutinated within 2 h. Strains of a, d, and f were also agglutinated in 2 h by the castor bean lectin RCA. S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. bovis, Actinomyces viscosus, A. naeslundii, and Lactobacillus plantarum were agglutinated within 2 h. The S. mutans type f polysaccharide was precipitated by Con A. The a, b, c, d, and e polysaccharides were not precipitated. Glucan from d and e strains of S. mutans and dextran T2000 were also precipitated by Con A. D-glucose inhibited the agglutination of type f cells by Con A and the agglutination of type d cells by D-galactose. The quantity of [acetyl-3H]Con A bound was not proportional to the degree of agglutination. Cells grown in sucrose medium bound more Con A than those grown in glucose medium. After treatment with dextranase, the sucrose-grown cells bound two- to fourfold more Con A. The binding of Con A to the type-specific polysaccharide or to teichoic acid could not be determined by the use of specific antibody due to the binding of Con A to the antibody globulin on the cell surface. Con A bound to S. mutans cells did not inhibit the activity of cell-bound glucosyltransferase, glucan synthesis, and in vitro adherence. Bound Con A also did not inhibit the ability of heat-treated cells to bind glucosyltransferase, synthesize glucan, and produce in vitro adherence.
TI  - Interaction of hydroxyapatite and protein-coated hydroxyapatite with Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - The present study showed that S. mutans and S. sanguis behaved like negatively-charged particles in their interaction with hydroxyapatite in vitro. Phosphate in the system inhibited bacterial uptake by apatite, whereas calcium increased the uptake. A layer of acidic protein inhibited the uptake of bacteria by hydroxyapatite. The opposite was true when a basic protein was first adsorbed to the apatite. A saliva film on the apatite decreased the uptake of bacteria, supporting the view that acidic proteins are selectively adsorbed by hydroxyapatite from saliva. The results indicate clearly that electrostatic forces may be involved in bacterial interaction with tooth surface.
TI  - The effect of adsorption on the acid production of caries and noncaries-producing streptococci.
AB  - Eighteen different Streptococcus strains including S mutans, sanguis, mitis, salivarius, bovis, and 2F2, were assayed for their relative adsorption to synthetic hydroxyapatite and for quantities of lactic acid produced while in the adsorbed state. The results indicated that all S mutans and some S sanguis have an enhanced metabolic activity while adsorbed to hydroxapatite as compared to control suspensions without hydroxyapatite.

AB  
TI  - Bacteriolytic action of fluoride ions.
AB  - Bacillus subtilis, Neisseria subflava, and LYT coccus were found to undergo massive lysis after growth in media containing 0.01 to 10 mM NaF. When cells of these organisms were transferred from late-exponential-phase cultures to 0.02 M sodium phosphate buffer plus 0.1 M KCl, they underwent spontaneous autolysis. Cells grown in media with fluoride were more liable to autolysis, and walls isolated from them also showed enhanced autolytic sensitivity, even though added fluoride did not directly stimulate autolysins. Sporadic or partial lysis occurred in populations of Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mutans BHT or LM-7 after growth in fluoridated media. Most bacteria that were tested did not undergo fluoride-induced lysis. However, cells of all test bacteria were found to have reduced amounts of peptidoglycan per unit of cell weight when grown in the presence of fluoride. Incorporation of labeled lysine or glucosamine into peptidoglycan (Park-Hancock residue) was stimulated, instead of inhibited, by fluoride. However, fluoride also stimulated the loss of radioactivity from Park-Hancock residues of cells that had previously incorporated labeled lysine or glucosamine. Thus, fluoride appeared to enhance peptidoglycan turnover, and this turnover reduced the peptidoglycan contents of all bacteria tested, but induced lysis in only those bacteria that normally have highly active autolytic systems.
TI  - Survival of bacteria from human dental plaque under various transport conditions.
AB  - The effects of transport media, temperature, and anaerobiosis on the survival of  bacteria from human supragingival dental plaque were studied. Individual samples were obtained by passing sterile, unwaxed dental floss through the interproximal spaces. The plaque-bearing portion of floss was immediately placed in vials containing reduced transport fluid, viability-preserving microbistatic medium, or reduced salt solution transport fluid. Plaque samples were dispersed by ultrasonic oscillation, serially diluted, and plated in duplicate on MM10-sucrose-blood agar, mitis salivarius bacitracin agar, and Rogosa tomato juice agar. Initial viable counts (time 0) were compared with viable count determinations after 48- and 72-h storage. Quantitative recovery (>30%) of various groups of oral bacteria was accomplished from both reduced transport fluid and viability-preserving microbistatic medium after 48- and 72-h storage. Storage of dental plaque in reduced salt solution proved unsatisfactory for most bacteria (less than 10% survival). Since growth of some bacteria may occur in viability-preserving microbistatic medium and the charcoal present interferes with colonly enumeration on low-dilution plates, we found reduced transport fluid to be the most suitable medium for transport and recovery of bacteria from supragingival dental plaque. Subzero storage (-196 and -40 degrees C) did not enhance the survival of bacteria from dental plaque; storage at moderate (5 and 20 degrees C) temperatures gave better recovery of viable bacteria. Survival after anaerobic or aerobic storage was comparable for total colony-forming units; however, anaerobic storage enhanced survival of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus. Since these organisms are specifically associated with dental caries, anaerobic techniques are preferred for caries activity testing of plaque.
TI  - Molecular basis for the different sucrose-dependent adherence properties of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - The enzymatic and adherence properties of Streptococcus mutans GS5 and S. sanguis ST3, both isolated from human carious lesions, have been compared. During growth in sucrose media, S. mutans GS5 adheres to smooth surfaces approximately three times more effectively than dose S. sanguis ST3. However, strain ST3 does not display sucrose-dependent adherence under nongrowth conditions, whereas strain GS5 displays significant adherence. Although both organisms synthesize both water-soluble and -insoluble glucans, the glucosyltransferases from S. mutans GS5 synthesize much more adherent glucan molecules than do the comparable enzymes from S. sanguis ST3. Both cell types bind exogenous glucosyltransferases synthesized by strain ST3 equally well, whereas cells of strain GS5 bind the comparable enzyme fraction that it synthesizes to a greater degree than do cell of S. sanguis ST3. However, in contrast to the results with cells of S. mutans GS5, the absorption of the glucosyltransferase activity synthesized by S. mutans GS5 to the surface of S. sanguis ST3 results in low levels of subsequent sucrose-dependent adherence. These results are discussed in terms of the molecular basis for the sucrose-dependent adherence of the oral streptococci to smooth surfaces.
TI  - Serum dilution test for bactericidal activity. II. Standardization and correlation with antimicrobial assays and susceptibility tests.
AB  
TI  - Measurement and synthesis of insoluble and soluble dextran by Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Total and insoluble dextransucrase activities of 10 strains of oral streptococci  were measured by a modified filter disk assay. Strains that were nonadherent to hard surfaces had only low levels of insoluble dextransucrase activity. A physical rather than metabolic mechanism is suggested to explain the decreased insoluble and increased soluble activities observed when dextran T-10 is added to the media.
TI  - Sucrose metabolism in resting-cell suspensions of caries associated and non-caries-associated dental plaque.
AB  - Small specimens of cariogenic plaque (CP) and non-cariogenic plaque (NCP) from the same tooth were individually dispersed in buffer, divided equally, and incubated for 45 min with [(14)C]sucrose uniformly labeled either in the glucosyl moiety or the fructosyl moiety. Sucrose metabolism was analyzed periodically during an anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees C. Radiochemical techniques were devised to analyze formation of lactic acid, soluble extracellular polysaccharide, total cell-bound and insoluble products, intracellular polysaccharide, lactic acid from intracellular polysaccharide catabolism, insoluble extracellular glucan, CO(2), total volatile acids, individual volatile acids, and rates of sucrose consumption. The contribution of the glucosyl and fructosyl moieties of sucrose to each metabolic by-product was determined. All of the metabolic data were adjusted to the size of the plaque specimens as determined by colony-forming units, Coulter counter particle counts, and fluorometric protein analyses. Both types of dental plaque transformed from 70 to 80% of the consumed sucrose into lactic acid and cell-bound and insoluble products, primarily intracellular polysaccharide and extracellular glucan. Volatile acids accounted for most of the remaining by-products. CP metabolized significantly more sucrose than NCP and consequently produced significantly higher levels of each metabolic by-product. High levels of Streptococcus mutans were found in CP (averaging 40% of colony-forming units), whereas it was virtually absent in NCP. Actinomyces and S. sanguis levels were distinctly higher in NCP. NCP harbored more anaerobes and dextranase-forming microorganisms than CP.
TI  - Production of extracellular material by streptococci associated with subacute bacterial endocarditis.
AB  - Six strains of viridans streptococci isolated from confirmed cases of subacute bacterial endocarditis were studied for production of extracellular material. All six strains, when grown to the exponential phase, produced exoproducts that had similar elution profiles on a G-100 Sephadex column. Since essential nutrients, such as amino acids, may be periodically growth limiting to streptococci in the fibrin-covered lesions on heart valves, the potential to elaborate extracellular protein and other material by streptococci that were deprived of essential amino acids was studied. Examination of supernatant fluids from cultures of Streptococcus MG intermedius deprived of glutamate and cystine revealed the presence of a complex mixture of extracellular materials in amounts comparable to those produced by normallly growing cells, Although only a slight (21 to 24%) increase in total protein occurred during amino acid deprivation of 12 h, the extracellular material contained numerous protein components, several of which demonstrated proteolytic activity. On a cell dry weight basis, the amino acid-deprived cells produced four-to eightfold more protease(s) than did exponential cells grown in complete medium. These results demonstrate that viridans streptococci are capable of elaborating potentially damaging compounds even when their multiplication has been arrested by nutritional deprivation.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of three iodine-containing compounds as antiplaque agents.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of three iodine-containing compounds was determined for strains of four dental plaque-forming microorganisms, using an in vitro preclinical plaque model system. Solutions of inorganic iodine, povidone-iodine, and Wescodyne were tested for antiplaque activity against preformed plaques of a number of strains of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus, and Actinomyces naeslundii. Solutions of inorganic iodine were more effective as antiplaque agents, with respect to minimal bactericidal concentration and time and frequency of treatments, than solutions of Wescodyne and povidone-iodine. Inorganic iodine appeared to be particularly effective against the most cariogenic (S. mutans) and periodontopathic (A. viscosus) organisms while allowing survival of the least orally pathogenic plaque-forming microorganism (S. sanguis). It is suggested that topical application of solutions of inorganic iodine may be useful in controlling dental caries and actinomyces-associated periodontal disease.
TI  - Antiplaque potential of topical stannous fluoride.
AB  - Sterile enamel samples treated by topical application of 10% stannous fluoride were incubated with S mutans and S sanguis respectively and with a mixed culture to which L casei had been added. The results were compared with sterile nonfluoridated enamel samples subjected to the same procedures. The parameters compared were postincubation pH values, bacterial concentrations on the surfaces, and enamel surface alterations. Stannous fluoride treated samples consistently yielded higher pH readings than nonfluoridated samples; the concentration of microorganisms adhering to the surfaces was conspicuously reduced on the pretreated enamel when compared by scanning electron microscopy to untreated samples, as were enamel surface alterations. These findings lend support to other recent investigations which have shown that fluorides act in several ways to inhibit cariogenesis in addition to reducing hydroxyapatite solubility.
TI  - Sucrose metabolism by prominent members of the flora isolated from cariogenic and non-cariogenic dental plaques.
AB  - Sucrose metabolism by resting-cell suspensions of pure cultures of representative members of the predominant cultivable flora isolated from cariogenic and non-cariogenic dental plaque was investigated by means of radiochemical techniques. Streptocococcus mutans utilized sucrose at a considerably faster rate than S. sanguis, S. mitis, Actinomyces viscosus, A. naeslundii, or Lactobacillus casei, forming lactic acid, intracellular polysaccharide, insoluble extracellular glucan, and lactic acid from intracellular polysaccharide catabolism at faster rates than the other bacteria. The Actinomyces formed more volatile acids than the streptococci, mostly acetic, and S. sanguis formed more soluble extracellular polysaccharide than the other bacteria. The metabolic activity of S. mutans resembled the pattern of sucrose metabolism of cariogenic plaque, whereas the metabolic activity of the Actinomyces species, the predominant members of non-cariogenic plaque flora, resembled the sucrose metabolism of non-cariogenic plaques.
TI  - Bacteriocins as factors in the in vitro interaction between oral streptococci in  plaque.
AB  - The effect of bacteriocins on the composition of dental plaque flora was studied  in vitro with bacterial plaque formed by oral streptococci on glass rods suspended in broth medium. Cell-free preparations containing mutacin SW31, a bacteriocin produced by Streptococcus mutans, killed sensitive cells present in the plaque selectively, but did not affect resistant cells. Similar preparations from a non-bacteriocinogenic mutant exerted only a slight effect. Mixed growth of bacteriocin-producing S. mutans SW31 with the sensitive S. sanguis Ny101 resulted in a nearly single-strain plaque of the former. Mutacin could be detected in the plaque substance as well as in the surrounding medium. A non-bacteriocinogenic mutant, which was shown not to be altered in functions affecting growth in plaque, allowed substantial growth of S. sanguis Ny101. Sequential inoculation of the bacteriocinogenic plaque former S. sanguis P3A3 and the sensitive S. mutans OMZ61 showed that the cells of the latter are killed rapidly in established plaques when inoculated with the bacteriocinogenic strain. A trypsin-sensitive antagonistic substance could be detected in the plaque, but not in the surrounding medium. The results indicate that bacteriocins can be active in plaque in vitro and suggest that bacteriocins could play a role in determining the composition of plaque in vivo.
TI  - New method for the isolation of Streptococcus mutans and its differentiation from other oral streptococci.
AB  - A new, improved agar medium for the isolation of Streptococcus mutans, the etiological agent of dental caries, was developed. In contrast to mitis-salivarius agar, this medium not only recovers a greater number of S. mutans strains from most oral specimens but, because of its mannitol and sorbitol content, it also facilitates the differentiation of S. mutans from other oral streptococci, e.g., S. salivarius, S. mitis, and S. sanguis, which do not grow or produce scanty growth only after 10 days of incubation. The medium is easy to prepare because of its simple and unique composition, is characterized by the presence of an acid indicator, and can be utilized under aerobic and anaerobic conditions as well. The medium cannot be used to distinguish among the eight serotypes, a to g and SL-1, of S. mutans. Mannitol-utilizing bacteria such as streptococci (e.g., S. faecalis) and other microorganisms (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus) are able to grow on this medium and can be distinguished from S. mutans by their unique colony morphology.
TI  - Comparison of antiplaque agents using an in vitro assay reflecting oral conditions.
AB  - An in vitro assay is described using saliva-treated bovine enamel slabs for determining the potential of chemotherapeutic agents to adsorb to tooth surfaces and act against plaque-forming bacteria. Chlorhexidine was found to inhibit the formation of in vitro plaque by Actinomyces viscosus, A naeslundii, Streptococcus mutans and S sanguis. Actinobolin was found to have marked antibacterial properties but limited adsorptive qualities.
TI  - Microbial characterization of an experimental cariogenic plaque in man.
AB  - Experimentally induced plaque seemed to originate by direct contact inoculation from the vestibular mucosa and saliva. During the next seven days, this plaque developed its own characteristics. Populations of Streptococcus mutans usually less than 2% of total streptococci population in plaques that were less than three days old, increased between days 3 and 7. Proportions of S sanguis, high in early samples, decreased after day 3. Populations of S salivarius, which usually outnumbered other streptococci, fluctuated widely through day 3, and then increased in proportion in subjects who were more productive of experimental caries, but decreased in subjects who were less productive. Proportions of plaque flora comprising lactobacilli paralleled those of S salivarius.

TI  - A sequential bacteriological and serological investigation of Rhesus monkeys immunised against dental caries with Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - In a serial investigation of the effects of immunisation with S. mutans in rhesus monkeys maintained on a "human" type of cariogenic diet, the numbers of S. mutans in cervical plaque, crevicular-fluid washings, fissures of teeth, and in saliva were lower in immunised animals than in sham-immunised controls. Immunisation also caused a delay in initial colonisation and a slowing of the rate of colonisation with S. mutans. These bacteriological changes were associated with a reduction in the smooth-surface-caries score. No relationship was found between the presence of S. sanguis and caries, but there was an inverse relationship between the proportions of S. mutans and S. sanguis isolated. Increased titres of complement-fixing, haemagglutinating and precipitating antibodies to S. mutans were found in the sera of immunised but not of control monkeys. A significant increase in salivary haemagglutinating antibodies was not detected. The results suggest that immunisation with S. mutans causes an increase in serum antibodies and a reduction in the number of S. mutans in the oral flora, and that these are associated with a reduction in dental caries.
TI  - Transfection of Streptococcus sanguis by phage deoxyribonucleic acid isolated from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556 cells were infected with free phage DNA of S, mutans strain PK 1. Two transformants were isolated which made colonies with large mucoid forms on mitis-salivarius agar. Both transformants had an increased ability to synthesize insoluble glucan and showed an adhesive nature on glass surfaces. These characteristics of the transformants bear a resemblance to S. mutans. These transformants had many physiological characteristics by which they could be recognized as S. sanguis. However, they resembled S. salivarius in forming a large amount of soluble fructan. Furthermore, the transformant cells did not produce ammonia from arginine, whereas their parent cells did.
TI  - Reduction of dental decay in rampant caries individuals following short-term kanamycin treatment.
AB  - A week of kanamycin gel treatment before and after the placement of dental restorations, compared to a placebo gel treatment, significantly reduced the levels of cultivable bacteria, S mutans and S sanguis, in the plaque samples collected immediately after the completion of the gel treatments, and was associated with a 46% reduction in new carious surfaces in the 14- to 37-month period following the gel treatment.
TI  - Physiological differentiation of viridans streptococci.
AB  - Twelve hundred and twenty-seven clinical isolates and eighty stock strains of viridans streptococci were tested for serological and physiological characteristics. Because the serological reactions of these strains varied, a differentiation scheme could not be based on these reactions. For the same reason, there could be no correlation of serological characteristics with physiological characteristics. Nearly 97% of the clinical isolates were speciated by differences in physiological characteristics. Ten different physiological species were recognized. The physiological speciation scheme was based on stable enzymatic reactions rather than on results of tolerance tests. The study included air-tolerant anaerobic streptococcal strains as well as viridans streptococcal strains not normally found in humans. The differentiation scheme and nomenclature of the author are related to those of other investigators. Differences in the distribution of species isolated from different clinical sources and human infections were also noted. A key for the differentiation of human isolates of viridans streptococci is proposed.
TI  - Competitive binding among oral strptococci to hydroxyapatite.
AB  - The relative affinity of various oral streptococci for hydroxyapatite (HA) differed widely. Streptococcus mutans affinity for dextran-coated HA was the highest of all the streptococci to any HA coating. S salivarius had the lowest affinity, and S sanguis affnity was higher then S miteor for saliva-coated HA. Competition for binding sites on saliva-dextran-coated, dextran-coated HA. Hhwever, competition between this pair was not for the same binding site but for closely associated sites.
TI  - Origin of esterases in human whole saliva.
AB  - Whole saliva of 59 healthy persons was used for determination of esterase activity. The pattern of esterase was studied by means of isoelectrofocusing on thin-layer acrylamide gels. The esterases found in whole saliva are suggested to be derived from the cells of the tissue in the oral cavity. This origin is indicated (e.g.) by comparison between isolectrophoretic esterase patterns of whole saliva, submandibular saliva, gingival biopsy and fibroblast culture. Antisera against partially purified saliva esterases were produced in rabbits. These sera, used in immunoelectro-osmophoresis, gave esterase-active immunoprecipitate against whole saliva, the water-soluble materials of disrupted gingival biopsy and fibroblast culture, but not against the material of the bacteria, Streptococcus sanguis, Strptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Actinomyces viscosus and Lactobacillus fermentum.

TI  - Serum antibodies to plaque bacteria in subjects with dental caries and gingivitis.
AB  - Correlations were sought between indices of gingival inflammation and dental caries experience and serum antibody titers to five species of oral bacteria. The material comprised 53 young adult males. A statistically significant, negative correlation was observed between the antibody titer to a pool of Veillonella strains and dental caries experience. Multiple regression analyses failed to reveal significant associations between periodontal disease and serum antibody titers. However, the data suggested a combined association of the titers to the strains of Veillonella and a strain of Fusobacterium with the periodontal index.

AB  - The acid production from maltitol was compared with the acid production from hydrogenated starch hydrolysate (Lycasin), sorbitol and xylitol by a number of oral strains and reference strains of Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. mitior, S. milleri, S. faecalis, S. faecium, S. avium, Lactobacillus casei and L. salivarius. The polyols were added to a final concentration of 1.0% to two different basal media. Incubation was performed at 37 degrees C for 7 days after which the pH was recorded. Maltitol was fermented only by the lactobacilli (about two thirds of the strains). Lycasin was fermented by all strains of S. faecalis, more than 90% of the lactobacilli, about half of the S. sanguis strains, about one third of the S. mutans strains, and by a few other streptococcal strains. Acid production from sorbitol was observed among more than 80% of the S. mutans strains and the S. faecalis strains and most of the lactobacilli strains. Sorbitol-fermenting strains of S. sanguis and of S. mitior, all isolated from sorbitol-consumers, were observed. No other sorbitol-fermenting streptococci were found. Only the reference strains L. salivarius subsp. salivarius ATCC 11741 and S. avium ATCC 14025 fermented xylitol.

TI  - Interaction of inflammatory cells and oral microorganisms. II. Modulation of rabbit polymorphonuclear leukocyte hydrolase release by polysaccharides in response to Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - The release of lysosomal hydrolases from polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) has  been postulated in the pathogenesis of tissue injury in periodontal disease. In the present study, lysosomal enzyme release was monitored from rabbit peritoneal exudate PMNs exposed to Streptocccus mutans or Streptococcus sanguis. S. mutans grown in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth failed to promote significant PMN enzyme release. S. sanguis grown in BHI broth, although more effective than S. mutants, was a weak stimulus for promotion of PMN hydrolase release. Preincubation of washed, viable S. mutans in sucrose or in different-molecular-weight dextrans resulted in the ability of the organisms to provoke PMN release reactions. This effect could bot be demonstrated with boiled or trypsinized S. mutans or with viable S. sanguis. However, when grown in BHI broth supplemented with sucrose, but not with glucose, both S. mutans and S. sanguis triggered discharge of PMN enzymes. The mechanism(s) whereby dextran or sucrose modulates PMN-bacterial interaction may in some manner be related to promotion of microbial adhesiveness or aggregation by dextran and by bacterial synthesis of glucans from sucrose.
TI  - Purification and some properties of free and cell-associated dextransucrase from  Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - Dextransucrase of Streptococcus sanguis occurred in cell-free and cell-associated forms. Cell-free dextransucrase was purified by four successive chromatographies on Bio-Gel P 60, DEAE-cellulose, and Bio-Gel P 200 from the culture supernatant. The purification of cell-associated dextransucrase was made from the pellet of Streptococcus sanguis culture. Bacterial pellet was extracted with 1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) and chromatographied by using an immunosorbent column. The two enzymes gave single bands in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel was about 100 000 daltons for the two forms of dextransucrases. The optimum pH of the cell-free and cell-associated enzymes was around 6 and the temperature optimum was broad for the two enzymes. The KM values for sucrose were respectively 2 mM and 3 mM for cell-free and cell-associated enzymes. When primer dextran was added, the reaction velocity increased but the KM for sucrose remained the same, and the KA for dextran was 200 muM for the two dextransucrases. Trehalose and maltose acted also as glucosyl residue acceptors. Purified enzymes had dextran synthesising activity and invertase-like activity. The same properties of the two forms of enzymes and the positive cross reaction against anti free and anti cell-associated globulins stongly suggest the identity of the two enzymes.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibilities of streptococci from the mouth and blood of patients  treated with penicillin or lincomycin and clindamycin.
AB  - Patients undergoing dental extractions were non-randomly allocated to three groups, one of which received no antibiotic, one benzylpenicillin followed by oral penicillin for 5 days, and the third intramuscular lincomycin followed by oral clindamycin. Dental extraction was performed at the beginning of the course of chemotherapy. Streptococci were isolated from the extracted teeth, from blood cultures collected before and immediately after dental extraction, and from sutures removed from the gums 5-7 days after the operation. The species of these organisms was determined, and their susceptibilities to penicillin, clindamycin, cephaloridine, erythromycin and tetracycline were assessed. The majority of streptococci isolated from teeth belonged to the species Streptococcus sanguis, S. mitior, S. mutans and S. milleri. Occasional isolates of each of these organisms collected before the antibiotic could take effect were resistant to penicillin. Three of these species, but not S. mutans, were the commonest streptococci to be isolated from the blood after dental extraction. Penicillin completely suppressed dental bacteriaemia under the conditions of our investigation, and lincomycin reduced the incidence by about 60 per cent. The commonest streptococci from sutures were also S. sanguis, S. mitior, S. mutans and S. milleri. S. faecalis was also isolated, but only in patients who had received antibiotics. Among the non-faecalis organisms, penicillin resistance was significantly more frequent among isolates from patients given penicillin than from patients not given this antibiotic, and clindamycin resistance was significantly more frequent among isolates from patients given lincomycin and clindamycin than from patients not given these antibiotics.
TI  - Blastogenic response of human lymphocytes to oral bacterial antigens: characterization of bacterial sonicates.
AB  - Soluble sonicate supernatant preparations were made from Actinomyces viscosus (ATCC 19246), A. naeslundii (ATCC 12104), two strains of Veillonella alcalescens (strain HV-1 and a human oral isolate), Streptococcus sanguis (ATCC 10556), S. mutans (strain 6715-T2), Bacteroides melaninogenicus (strain K110), and Leptotrichia buccalis (isolated from human dental plaque). These supernatants were characterized with reference to their chemical and antigenic components and their biological activity determined by using in vitro lymphocyte blastogenesis as a measure of the host's cellular immune response. The sonicate supernatant of each bacterium contained protein, neutral sugars, methylpentose, and nucleic acids. Protein was the major component in all except L. buccalis, in which neutral sugars predominated. The antigenic components in each supernatant were detected by using rabbit antisera prepared against the whole bacteria and the sonicate supernatant. The supernatants showed a complex antigenic distribution on immunoelectrophoretic analysis. The supernatants were shown to be antigenic and not mitogenic in nature, since neither cord blood lymphocytes nor all adult lymphocytes were stimulated. The supernatant antigen preparations showed a reproducible, dose-dependent, and kinetic response in vitro, which was similar to that seen with the antigen preparation streptokinase-streptodornase.

TI  - Initial colonization of teeth in monkeys as related to diet.
AB  - The initial phases of plaque development on nonretentive tooth surfaces were studied bacteriologically in Macaca irus monkeys fed by stomach tube and provided with various oral supplements. Except for the oral implantation of Streptococcus mutans in some of the animals, the oral flora was not changed prior to the studies. Dental plaque was allowed to develop on initially cleaned tooth surfaces for 3 to 5 h. Plaque samples were collected and cultured on a number of selective and nonselective agar media, and several hundred isolates from each sample were isolated and identified. The numerically predominant organisms in initial plaque were S. mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, and Actinomyces viscosus. Additional organisms regularly found, but usually in smaller numbers, were Streptococcus mitior and a group of fastidious gram-negative rods including Haemophilus species, Eikenella corrodens, and Actinobacillus actinomycetem-comitans. The colonization of S. mutans was dependent on sucrose and occurred at the expense of S. sanguis. In these experiments S. mutans accounted for 25 to 65% of the primary plaque formers. All other species encountered colonized the teeth irrespective of the diet. It is postulated that the early sucrose-dependent establishment of S. mutans directly on the enamel pellicle plays a key role in the development of a cariogenic plaque.

AB  - Methods for rapid preclinical testing of antiplaque agents in vitro using hydroxyapatite (HT)-coated glass beads are described. The assays developed could reliably detect (i) prevention of growth in the culture fluid or on the HT surfaces, (ii) the effect of transient exposure of a bactericidal agent on the viability of cells in a preformed bacterial mat, (iii) reversible adsorption of a bactericidal agent on an HT surface, and (iv) the ability of an agent to inhibit adsorption of Streptococcus sanguis to an HT surface or to salivary proteins adsorbed to an HT surface.
TI  - Autolysis in strains of viridans streptococci.
AB  - Seven strains of viridans streptococci of the species Streptococcus sanguis, S. mutans and S. mitis were investigated for autolysis. The effect of pH, salt concentration and temperature on the autolytic process was studied in Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 buffer. Whole cells and walls of all strains autolysed most rapidly at pH values above 7. Autolysis of whole cells of S. sanguis and one strain of S. mitis (ATCC15909) was maximal in 0-05 TO 0-2 M buffer, while the two S. mutans strains and S. mitis ATCC15912 showed maximal autolysis in 0-5 and 1-0 M buffers. Cultures harvested in the stationary phase of growth possessed only slightly decreased autolytic activity compared with those from the exponential phase. Whole cells autolysed more rapidly at 37 degrees C Than at 45 degrees C and 10 degrees C. Autolysis of isolated walls of three strains of S. mitis (ATCC903, ATCC15909 and ATCC15912) was maximal at pH 7-0 AND 7-5 and in 1-0 M buffers. Streptococcus mitis ATCC15909 also showed maximal lysis in 0-01 M and 0-5 M buffers. An endopeptidase action of the autolytic system of S. mitis ATCC15912 was indicated by the progressive release of soluble amino groups during autolysis of the walls. No release of reducing groups was observed. Several free amino acids were released during autolysis of these walls, alanine, lysine and glutamic acid being in greatest quanitity.

TI  - Occurrence and distribution of sucrose-metabolizing enzymes in oral streptococci.
AB  - Specific growth rates, growth yields, and the level and cellular distribution of  three sucrose-metabolizing enzyme activities were determined for seven oral streptococci (Streptococcus mutans strains E49, BHT, 10449, SL-1, and LM-7, S. sanguis 10558, and S. salivarius 25975). Cultures were grown in a fermentor at pH 6 with either 20 mM glucose or 10 mM sucrose. Generation times varied between 21 and 70 min. Whereas some strains grew 10 to 50% more slowly with sucrose than with glucose, others did not. Growth was always logarithmic, and the growth yields were similar. Glcosyl transferase (EC 2.4.1.5) was largely extracellular; in sucrose cultures it was appreciably lower, but no major shift to a cell-associated form was found. In glucose cultures, the activity varied between 4 and 140 IU per 6-liter culture. The glucan formed was mostly or exclusively water insoluble. Glcosyl transferase was stimulated weakly (60% or less) by various dextrans. Fructosyl transferase (EC 2.4.1.10) was primarily extracellular (except in glucose cultures of S. salivarius) and varied between 0 and 337 IU/culture. In S. salivarius, the extracellular fructosyl transferase was induced by sucrose. In all S. Mutans cultures, the total fructosyl transferase activity was lower after growth with sucrose. All strains had extra- and intracellular invertase (EC 3.2.1.26) activity. Total levels varied between 210 and 3,500 IU/culture. Less extracellular activity was present in sucrose cultures. Only S. salivarius had appreciable activity in the cellular particulate fraction. Invertase activity was significantly higher than the combined glucosyl and fructosyl transferase activities in all cultures.
TI  - Streptococci and aerococci associated with systemic infection in man.
AB  - A collection of 820 isolates of streptococci and aerococci from human blood or internal organs was classified by means of a set of cultural and biochemical tests. Of these, 719 (712 streptococci and 7 aerococci) were from patients believed to be suffering from a systemic infection: endocarditis 317; a purulent lesion in an internal organ ("purulent disease") 152; bacteriaemia 250. The endocarditis streptococci included members of all recognisable taxa, but only certain of these were common: Streptococcus sanguis, 16-4%; dextran-positive and usually mannitol-fermenting strains of S. bovis (S. bovis I), 15-1%; S. mutans, 14-2%; S. mitior, 13-2%. Streptococci of the "alpha-haemolytic" taxa (S. sanguis, S. mitior and related strains) formed only 44-8% of the total. When the percentage frequency of streptococcal taxa among the endocarditis and "non-endocarditis" isolates was compared, the dextran-forming taxa (S. mutans, S. bovis I, S. sanguis, and dextran-positive streptococci otherwise resembling S. mitior) all had higher "endocarditis : non-endocarditis" ratios than did any of the non-dextran-producing taxa. Endocarditis increased in frequency with age, and showed an excess of males over females up to the age of 65 years. In young patients (less than 35 years), "alpha-haemolytic" streptococci predominated; with increasing age, the proportion of other streptococci increased progressively but the absolute numbers of isolations of "alpha-haemolytic" streptococci did not fall. Infections with S. mutans were prominent in the age-group 35-54 years and with S. bovis I at ages greater than or equal to 55 years. A history of previous heart disease was more often obtained in endocarditis due to "alpha-haemolytic" streptococci than in other streptococcal endocarditis. The streptococcus most often isolated from purulent lesions in internal organs was S. milleri (29-3%). It was associated with brain abscess, meningitis, pleural empyema and a variety of intra-abdominal abscesses. The only common predisposing factor in endocarditis was previous heart damage. In other systemic streptococcal diseases, other general or local predisposing causes could be observed, mainly in infections with the "pyogenic" groupable streptococci, the enterococci and S. milleri.

TI  - Susceptibility of some plaque microorganisms to chemotherapeutic agents.
AB  - Investigators have used chemotherapeutic agents topically for plaque control without knowing the drug concentration necessary to inhibit the growth of odontopathic microorganisms. S mutans, S sanguis, A viscosus and A naeslundii are important components of the plaque flora. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC) of niddamycin, vancomycin, bacitracin, and kanamycin were determined for each organism in liquid culture. These antibiotics were selected because of their low absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Niddamycin, vancomycin, and bacitracin had the lowest MIC, from 0.2 to 10 units/ml. Kanamycin was inhibitory only at much higher concentrations (130 to 500 units/ml). The corresponding MBC was generally higher than the MIC. A viscosus was the most resistant organism tested. These data are important in designing controlled release devices for delivering a suitable antibiotic on a continuous basis intraorally.
TI  - Nutritional determinants of the ecology of the oral flora.
AB  - Consideration of nutritional factors as determinants of oral microbial ecology leads to the conclusion that endogenous factors play a dominant role. It is the interactions between specific microorganisms and nutritional and other factors provided by the host that selectively determine the kinds of microorganisms which willinitially reside in the oral cavity and the sites which they will colonize. The persistence of these original "colonists" in their respective ecologic niches will depend in part on the accessibility of endogenous nutrients variously provided by saliva, tissue exudates, crevicular fluids, or degenerating host cells. It will also depend on their response to and interaction with microorganisms which immigrate to that site subsequently. The microbial ecology of a given site is therefore rarely uncomplicated, the notable exception occurring at the most microscopic level where one may encounter microcolonies of individual species within more heterogenous populations of microorganisms. The extent of this heterogeneity quantitatively and qualitatively is a reflection of the degree to which the interactions between the resident flora and the new arrivals, plus the local environmental changes which they both generate, serve to promote or to discourage the survival and growth of the individual species. This element of heterogeneity in a dynamic system with its inherent potential for variation makes it possible for relatively minor changes in local environmental conditions to result in significant differences in the microflora between one site and another even though they may be in close proximity to each other. Once this concept is appreciated it becomes easy to understand how disease processes such as dental caries may affect specific areas of a tooth while nearby areas are unaffected. The effects of exogenous nutrients on the ecology of the oral microbiota, nevertheless cannot be ignored. The diet may modulate such endogenous factors as the salivary secretions and the local resistance of the gingival tissues to infections. Although at our present state of knowledge the direct influence of dietary proteins and fats on the oral microbiota is thought to be of relatively minor consequence, dietary carbohydrates are of major ecological significance. Dietary sugars provide readily available substrates for the oral microorganisms, most of which depend on carbohydrates for energy sources. The metabolism of dietary sucrose by S. sanguis and S. mutans with the productions of acids and intracellular and extracellular polysaccharides has specific influence on the microbial composition, metabolic activities, and mass of coronal plaque. The ready availability of dietary carbohydrates undoubtedly influences the microflora of other parts of the oral cavity as well, eic species or indirectly through the interactions of other organisms with them...
TI  - Effect of growth medium on amino acid pools of oral streptococci.
AB  
TI  - Dextran-mediated interbacterial aggregation between dextran-synthesizing streptococci and Actinomyces viscosus.
AB  - Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mutans bind to the surface of Actinomyces viscosus, producing large microbial aggregates. Aggregates form rapidly and are not easily dissociated by vigorous mixing. The binding is mediated by dextran. Glucose-grown streptococci will not aggregate unless they are first mixed with high-molecular-weight dextran. Aggregation is induced with dextrans isolated from Leuconostoc, S. sanguis, or S. mutans. Sucrose-grown streptococci will adhere to A. viscosus without the addition of an exogenous source of dextran. A. viscosus will bind dextran and then bind glucose-grown streptococci. Aggregation occurs over a wide pH range and is dependent on cations. The aggregating activity of A. viscosus is both protease and heat sensitive. The aggregating activity of S. sanguis is heat stable but sensitive to dextranase.
TI  - Correlation between streptococci of human dental plaques and dental caries.
AB  - Plaque samples from 27 buccal tooth surfaces were obtained with sterile McCall curettes from available third molars. Bacteriological sampling and biochemical tests were carried out to identify four groups of streptococci, i.e. Str. mutans, Str. spp., Str. sanguis and Str. mitis. Clinical examinations carried out 6 months after the dental scrapings were taken showed a strong positive correlation between detectable lesions and Str. mutans.
TI  - Streptoccus mutans dextransucrase: purification, properties, and requirement for  primer dextran.
AB  - We attempted to purify dextransucrase from S mutans strain 6715 to investigate its properties and determine if multiple species of the enzyme existed. It was concluded that the properties of this enzyme such as the pH (5.5), temperature (37 C) optimum, and Km for sucrose (3 mM) are very similar to those reported for S sanguis, S bovis, S mutans strain OMZ-176 isozymes, S mutans strain GS-5, and the single dextransucrase purified from S mutans strain HS-6. The IEF enzyme preparation consisted of two enzyme species, possibly differing in their ability to synthesize different dextran linkages. The minor enzyme activity demonstrated a strict primer dependency. Similarly, primer dependency has been reported for dextransucrases from S mutans, S sanguis, and L mesenteroides. S mutans strain 6715 dextransucrase also showed both the insertion and stepwise mechanisms for dextran synthesis. Sucrose was the sole glucose donor, whereas dextran was a specific, highly efficient glucose acceptor. The complex primer kinetics are not fully understood at this time and require further investigation. Without linkage analysis of the products of our enzymes, we can only postulate that each enzyme has a different function in the synthesis of interresidue and interchain alpha1-3 and alpha1-6 bonds. Insoluble dextran synthesis may involve a special enzyme mechanism characteristic of S mutans. This synthesis would require both enzymes, possibly in some aggregated form, with one enzyme synthesizing endogenous primer dextran. This endogeneous primer or some cell wall polysaccharide could stimulate both enzymes to rapidly synthesize heterogeneously linked insoluble dextran.
TI  - Some serological cross-reactions between Streptococcus mutans, S sanguis, and other dental plaque streptococci.
AB  - From the preliminary observations described in this report, the following conclusions may be drawn. When attempting to produce diagnostic antiserums specific for S mutans, S mitior, or S sanguis, care must be taken to eliminate cross-reactions as a result of antibodies against extracellular glucans or dextrans. Other antigenic components, associated with the cell wall, may be common to different species. One soluble protein or polypeptide antigen normally present in S sanguis and S mitior may also be demonstrated in certain strains of S mutans. Antiserums prepared against S sanguis, S mitior, or S mutans should be carefully checked for interspecies cross-reactions before being used for identification purposes.
TI  - Immunologic basis for vaccination against dental caries in rhesus monkeys.
AB  - The effects of immunization with Streptococcus mutans on the development of caries and the immune responses were investigated in 37 young rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) during a period of up to 33 months. The monkeys were supplied a human type of carbohydrate-rich diet that contained about 15% sucrose. The monkeys were separated into seven groups, and the effects of two whole cell vaccines and an extracellular culture extract of S mutans in Freund's incomplete adjuvant were compared with a vaccine of a noncariogenic Streptococcus CHT, the adjuvant alone, and a sham immunized group. Sequential analysis of complement fixing, hemagglutinating and precipitating antibodies to the cell wall, and extracellular culture extract have shown that a significant reduction in smooth surface and fissure caries resulted from immunization with the S mutans vaccines, if antibodies reached an optimum level before caries development started. Protection was not elicited by the culture extract of S mutans or the noncariogenic Streptococcus CHT vaccines. A recently developed bacteriological sampling technique of crevicular fluid, plaque, and saliva showed that caries reduction in immunized animals was associated with a significantly decreased percentage of S mutans in crevicular fluid. Immunochemical studies showed IgG and IgM classes of antibodies in serum and secretory IgA antibodies in saliva, but it appears that reduction in caries was best associated with serum IgG antibodies to the culture extract of S mutans. The humoral and cellular mechanisms involved in the immunologic control of caries are discussed in terms of a central afferent mechanism required for antigen processing and cellular proliferation, and two peripheral effector mechanisms that function in the crevicular and salivary domains.
TI  - Comparative ultrastructure of selected oral streptococci: thin-sectioning and freeze-etching studies.
AB  - The ultrastructure of Streptococcus mutans, serotypes a-e, S. sanguis, S. mitis,  and S. salivarius HHT, were examined by the techniques of thin-sectioning and freeze-etching. The cell walls varied in width between 15 and 46 nm and were covered with an electron-dense fibrillar or fuzz layer. The cytoplasmic membrane was in close association with numerous mesosomes which were, in turn, either closely associated or in contact with the bacterial chromosome. In freeze-etch replicas, the outermost layer of the cell wall was fibrous, and the cytoplasmic membrane was covered with particles composed of several subunits. Both particle-clusters and particle-free areas occurred on the surfaces of the cytoplasmic membrane, as well as a crystalline array in the ground plasm of the cell.
TI  - Effect of a fluoride-containing chlorhexidine gel on bacteria in human plaque.
AB  - The effect on the plaque flora of a fluoride-containing chlorhexidine gel in mouthpieces was studied in seven subjects. Use of the gel during a 3-month period resulted in a change in the pattern of sensitivity to cholorhexidine in the plaque flora as displayed by determination of the minimal inhibitory amount (MIA) of the drug in agar diffusion assays. Three months after the use of gel was discontinued, the MIA value for plaque bacteria had returned to its original level. The relative proportions of S. mutans and S. sanguis in plaque changed during the chlorhexidine period. Thus S. mutans could not be detected in plaque samples after 3-month use of the gel, and the frequency of S. sanguis was altered.
TI  - [Total bacterial count and the occurrence of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis in the air of various work areas].
AB  - In the various rooms of the Wurzburg Dental School, the total germ contamination  of the air and the incidence of S. mutans and S. sanguis strains was studied. The total number of organisms found as well as the number of the two polysaccharide-producing organisms varied considerably. The presence of the two streptococcal strains is not restricted to the air in dental surgeries. It is considered to be an additional risk that by far the highest incidence of the cariogenic S. mutans strain is found in the air of the rooms of the outpatient clinic for restorative dentistry and periodontology.
TI  - Interspecies transformation of streptomycin resistance in oral streptococci.
AB  - Donor deoxyribonucleic acid extracted from streptomycin-resistant (Str(R)) mutant derivatives of a variety of strains of Streptococcus mutans, S. salivarius, and S. sanguis was used to transform streptomycin resistance into competent S. sanguis strain Challis. Transfer of genetic markers for sorbitol and mannitol fermentation and for extracellular polysaccharide as demonstrated by colonial morphology was not detected in this study. Reciprocal transformation between strain Challis and other oral streptococci could not be demonstrated. Transformation frequencies for Str(R) were relatively efficient among S. sanguis strains, with lower but significant frequencies demonstrated with strain Challis and donor deoxyribonucleic acid derived from other oral streptococci.
TI  - Strain typing of oral streptococci by the use of bacterial antagonism.
AB  - Strain-typing methods utilizing microbial antagonism have been developed for S sanguis and for S mutans. The inhibition observed resembled that of bacteriocins. Inhibition within the species S sanguis was obtained with group D streptococci and facultative members of the genus Bacillus. Thirty-three inhibitors were paired (not in all possible combinations) with 37 isolates of S sanguis. Depending on the inhibitor, growth of between 15 and 85% of the sensitive indicators was halted. Three of the inhibitors manifested identical patterns of inhibition. Of the 37 S sanguis isolates, 34 exhibited individual patterns of inhibition. The three exceptions could be differentiated by their antagonism against sensitive indicators of S mutans. Variations in susceptibility to antagonism produced by group D streptococci allowed each of ten strains of S mutans to be typed. Present work for typing the oral streptococci is focused on computer-assisted searches for minimal typing sets. S mutans is sensitive to inhibition by some members of the species S sanguis. From a group of 58 challengers, 44 inhibited at least one of ten strains of S mutans, and 11 strains of S sanguis were able to halt the growth of half or more of the sensitive indicators. These results are useful not only for strain typing but form the basis for in vivo competition studies.

TI  - Cellular fatty acid composition of Streptococcus mutans and related streptococci.
AB  - The cellular fatty acid composition of 18 strains of Streptococcus mutans and 17  isolates of related streptococci were examined by gas-liquid chromatography. The cultures could be divided into two distinct groups on the basis of their fatty acids. The first group, which included S mutans and S salivarius, contained palmitic (16:0), octadecenoic (18:1), stearic (18:0), eicosenoic (20:1), and eicosanoic (20:0) acids. The presence of the two 20-carbon fatty acids distinguished S mutans and S salivarius from all of the other species. Two of the S mutans cultures were further distinguished by the presence of 19-carbon and 21-carbon cyclopropane acids. The second group included S sanguis, S mitis, S uberis, and a culture of Lancefield group C streptococci. The percentages of the major acids (16:0, 18:1, and 18:0) found in these species were essentially identical. A culture of Lancefield group E streptococci contained large amounts of 16:1 and 18:1 and small amounts of two unidentified acids which were not present in any of the other cultures.

TI  - Physiological classification of oral viridans streptococci.
AB  - The human mouth harbors large numbers of a variety of greening streptococci. For  many years the classification and nomenclature of these organisms have been confused, but recent studies have clarified the situation considerably. Five distinct species can be distinguished among the oral streptococci S mutans, S sanguis, S mitior, S milleri, and S salivarius, and these may be identified using a simple scheme consisting of seven physiological tests. Further subdivisions within these species may be achieved using serological methods. A small number of oral streptococci remain which cannot easily be identified with existing schemes. These may represent additional species that, as yet, have not been adequately described. There seems little justification for continuing the practive of calling all alpha-hemolytic streptococci simple "Streptococcus viridans".

It has been found that each abscesses is associated with only one type of a given species of Streptococcus. The distribution of types of Strep. mitis found in abscesses differed from the distribution in healthy mouths, but no particular type occurred significantly more often in abscesses than in mouths.

TI  - Turku sugar studies X. Occurrence of polysaccharide-forming streptococci and ability of the mixed plaque microbiota to ferment various carbohydrates.
AB  - Dental plaque samples collected from the subjects during the last 20 months of the 2 year trial were subjected to quantitative and qualitative analysis of the occurrence of S. mutans, S. sanguis, S. salivarius and the total growth on phenol red agar. Lyophilized plaque samples were homogenized and incubated on a sucrose containing medium under anaerobic conditions. In addition, the pH-values were measured after incubation of the mixed plaque flora in media containing 1% respectively xylitol(X), sorbitol, sucrose (S), fructose (F) or no carbohydrates. The results show a significantly lower incidence of S. mutans in the X-group relative to the S- and F-groups. The corresponding difference could not be observed between the S- and F-groups. The logarithmic means and standard deviations of the colony counts of S. sanguis, S. salivarius and total bacteria yielded no significant differences between the 3 sugar groups during the test period. Repeated pH-measurements, carried out at the 4, 12, 18 and 24 month phases, showed that, except in the presence of X, the mean values all fell below the pH-limit of 5.5. In the course of the study, no evidence was obtained of adaption of mutation enabling acidogenic decomposition of X. These findings emphasize the importance of low acidogenic potential in dental plaque, generally paralleled by a low incidence of dental caries.
TI  - Extracellular glucans produced by oral streptococci.
AB  
TI  - Optimum immunization of rabbits for Streptococcus mutans antiserum and conjugate  production and studies of batch immunoabsorption methods.
AB  - By far, the most significant rises in titers were seen with the immunization protocol used in series 6. Conjugates prepared from bleedings on the 33rd day produced exceptionally high titers for type b S mutans, and reasonably high titers for type a were obtained in a short time. A concentrated antigen with Formalin (13.4 ml) was given during a ten-day period followed by a two-week rest period, after which booster doses of either antigen with Formalin or live antigen were given (Fig 1). Based on evaluation of the immunization protocol just described, series 6 resulted in the highest titered reagents, but the data are insufficient to permit recommending that particular schedule without limitations. Our experience in the use of live antigens of S mutans for immunization is limited in that only types b, c, and e have been used in this way. The rabbits survived these injections, but the pathogenicity of other strains and other serotypes has not been determined. In addition, protocols including combined injections of killed and living organisms should be tested further for possible improvement in antibody production. In view of these considerations, our recommendations for production of high titered antiserums for S mutans in rabbits are as follows: -Take a preimmunization bleeding from each rabbit and screen by indirect FA tests with the antigens to be used. -Inject heavy concentrations (40 IU/ml) of Formalin-killed cells, intravenously. -Inject for eight to ten consecutive days, giving increasing doses of antigen ranging from 0.2 to 5.0 ml for a total of 12 to 15 ml. -Rest the rabbits for one week. If you are monitoring the progress of immunization, bleed the rabbits before giving booster injections. -Give booster injections on four consecutive days, giving 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 ml of live antigen that has been washed one time to remove traces of media and adjusted to a concentration of 40 IU/ml. If live antigen is not used, continue to give booster injections with killed antigen, injecting 2.0 ml on each of three consecutive days. -Rest the rabbits for one week and take sufficient blood to produce the trial reagents needed, or exsaguinate the rabbits. Absorption of type a conjugates resulted in the total loss of titer for type a cells. The cross-reactions with type b conjugate were easily eliminated by dilution, with the exception of the cross-reaction with S sanguis JC-43. Bratthall's absorption method eliminated all cross-reactions of the type b conjugate. Absorption of type c conjugate successfully removed the cross-reaction with type e cells; however, the loss of homologous type c titer was so great that this absorption is of limited value. High-titered conjugates for types d and e have been obtained by using batch absorption procedures.
TI  - Turku sugar studies XX. Microbiological findings and plaque index values in relation to 1-year use of xylitol chewing gum.
AB  - The aim was to study possible alterations in the microbial flora of plaque and saliva in relation to partial substitution of dietary sucrose with xylitol. The development of plaque index values was observed simultaneously. These observations were carried out during a 1-year clinical trial, the effects of sucrose (S) and xylitol (X) chewing gum on the incidence of dental caries being observed in 100 young adults. Paraffin-stimulated saliva samples were diluted stepwise and cultivated on Rogosa S.L. agar and Sabouraud agar aerobically. Lyophilized dental plaque samples were cultivated on phenol red agar under anaerobic and aerobic conditions. The pH-values were measured after incubating the mixed plaque flora for 1 and 7 days in the presence of various sugars. Both the arithmetic and geometric means of the total CFU values on Rogosa S.L. agar decreased in the S-group at the 6-month phase but returned to the starting level after one year, whereas in the X-group they decreased or remained on the starting level. At the 6-month phase the difference between the groups was significant (U-test, p = 0.0013) and almost significant (U-test, p = 0.0569) at the end of the study. No significant differences or changes could be seen between or within the groups on Sabouraud agar. The geometric mean values of S. sanguis and S. mutans as well as the total CFU values on phenol red agar decreased considerably in both the S- and X-groups, but no significant differences could be detected in any of the streptococcal counts between the groups. The pH of the carbohydrate-containing culture media infected with mixed dental plaque significantly decreased, with the exception of the xylitol containing ones in which the pH values were not lowered even after 7 days' incubation. A significant decrease in plaque formation in relation of chewing per se was demonstrable. The difference in the plaque index values equalling or exceeding 2 was significant between the S- and X-groups. No bacterial adaptation to utilize xylitol occurred during the trial.

TI  - The reaction of salivary substances with bacteria.
AB  - Reactions between selected strains of oral streptococci and saliva were studied spectrophotometrically. The curves of absorbance (700 nm) versus those of time were sigmoidal for aggregating saliva-bacteria mixtures. Whtn the logarithm of the ratio of the change in absorbance to the remaining absorbance was plotted against the reaction time, straight lines were obtained. At a fixed concentration of bacteria, the slope of these lines for a series of dilutions of a selected saliva sample was a parabolic function of the volume of saliva in the reaction mixtures. A model for the aggregation reaction was developed which explained the shape of these parabolic curves. The parameters of the model can be calculated from the experimental data and can be used to estimate the concentration of aggregation-inducing substances in undiluted saliva. A method for calculating the specific rate constant for the binding of free cells to aggregates was developed. This rate constant is a characteristic feature of a given aggregation reaction and can, in principle, be used to distinguish between aggregation-inducing substances of different molecular structures.
TI  - Isolation and purification of Flavobacterium alpha-1,3-glucanase-hydrolyzing, insoluble, sticky glucan of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Studies were made on the physical and chemical properties of polysaccharides synthesized by cell-free extracts of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus sp. and their susceptibilities to dextranases. Among the polysaccharides examined, insoluble glucans were rather resistant to available dextranase preparations, and the insoluble, sticky glucan produced by S. mutans OMZ 176, which could be important in formation of dental plaques, was the most resistant. By enrichment culture of soil specimens, using OMZ 176 glucans as the sole carbon source, an organism was isolated that produced colonies surrounded by a clear lytic zone on opaque agar plates containing the OMZ 176 glucan. The organism was identified as a strain of Flavobacterium and named the Ek-14 bacterium. EK-14 bacterium was grown in Trypticase soy broth, and an enzyme capable of hydrolyzing the OMZ 176 glucan was concentrated from the culture supernatant and purified by negative adsorption on a diethylaminoethyl-cellulose (DE-32) column and gradient elution chromatography with a carboxymethyl-cellulose (CM-32) column. The enzyme was a basic protein with an isoelectric point of pH 8.5 and molecular weight of 65,000. Its optimum pH was 6.3 and its optimal temperature was 42 C. The purified enzyme released 11% of the total glucose residues of the OMZ 176 glucan as reducing sugars and solubilized about half of the substrate glucan. The products were found to be isomaltose, nigerose, and nigerotriose, with some oligosaccharides. The purified enzyme split the alpha-1,3-glucan endolytically and was inactive toward glucans containing alpha-1,6, alpha-1,4, beta-1,3, beta-1,4, and/or beta-1,6 bonds as the main linkages.
TI  - Glucose-6-phosphate-dependent pyruvate kinase in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Pyruvate kinase of Streptococcus mutans JC 2 had an absolute and specific requirement for glucose-6-phosphate. Inorganic phosphate was a strong inhibitor. The enzyme required K+ or NH4+ and Mg2+ or Mn2+. S. mutans FIL and E 49, Streptococcus bovis ATCC 9809, and Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 13419 had also glucose-6-phosphate-dependent pyruvate kinases, whereas Streptococcus sanguis NCTC 10904 had an enzyme activated by fructose-1,6-diphosphate.
TI  - Amino acid requirements and proteolytic activity of Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - The growth response of Streptococcus sanguis groups 1:A and 1:B in a complete chemically defined medium was not influenced by the oxygen concentration of the growth atmosphere. All of the cultures required cysteine and arginine; tyrosine and branched-chain amino acids were frequently required. Proteolysis of casein, mucin, and the anionic proteins of germfree rat saliva by S. sanguis was demonstrated. Hydrolytic activity toward casein was found in the soluble contents of the cells and in the cellular debris after disruption of the cells, with the soluble fractions exhibiting greater proteolytic activity toward casein. The soluble fractions from S. sanguis did not hydrolyze mucin, but this substrate was hydrolyzed by the cell debris fraction. When the amino acid requirements and proteolytic activity of S. sanguis and S. mutans were compared, these two oral streptococcal species exhibited distinct and characteristic differences.

AB  - The effects of dietary sucrose levels on the microbial composition of 4- and 12-day plaque were investigated in eight dental students. Sucrose-rich diets had no demonstrable effects on total plaque accumulation, whereas total viable microbial density, Streptococcus mutans, and the lactobacilli populations increased. The S sanguis population was unaffected. However, in individual subjects, an inverse relationship between the S sanguis and S mutans population was observed.
TI  - Investigation of possible solvents for extracellular polysaccharides from Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - The solubilities of extracellular polysaccharide fractions produced by 14 oral streptococcal strains were compared in water, aqueous lithium and guanidine salt solutions, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and a 9:1 DMSO-water mixture. The best results for solubilizing the fractions were obtained with the DMSO-water mixture procedure, which used the water and DMSO in sequence. By this method all fo the fractions were solubilized.
TI  - Variations in microbial and biochemical components of four-day plaque during a four-week controlled diet period.
AB  - Variation in microbial and biochemical components of human four-day plaque was studied in seven subjects who were maintained on a high-sucrose diet during a four-week period. Significant changes in populations of lactobacilli dextranase-producing organisms, Streptococcus mutans, and S sanguis occurred during this period.
TI  - Evaluation of human oral organisms and pathogenic Streptococcus for production of IgA protease.
AB  - IgA protease is a proteolytic enzyme found in whole human saliva and in dental plaque that cleaves both secretory and myeloma IgA of human origin to yield intact Fabalpha and Fcalpha fragments. To determine which bacteria are capable of producing this enzyme, we have examined a variety of strains normally found in the human oral cavity and a number of streptococci of known Lancefield group serotype. Streptococci of groups A, B, C, D, F, G, H, M, and N, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitior, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus faecalis, Veillonella, Lactobacillus, Actinomyces, Propionibacterium, Bacteroides, and Fusobacterium were grown in liquid medium, and fluids were examined for IgA protease activity. Only S. sanguis and clinically isolated group H streptococci elaborated IgA protease under the culture conditions used. Negative strains could not be stimulated to produce the enzyme when cultured in the presence of secretory IgA. Among the natural oral bacteria, capacity to produce IgA protease is restricted to certain species of Streptococcus, notably those of the group H serotype. Since secretory immunity is mediated by the IgA class of antibody, the presence of this enzyme at mucosal surfaces could modify the secretory immune function.
TI  - Chemical composition of the washed cells of Streptococcus sanguis (804) and Streptococcus mutans (B-14).
AB  - Washed cells of Streptococcus saguis (804) and Streptococcus mutans (B14) were analyzed for water, ash, protein, carbohydrate, lipid, and nucleic acid content. Lipids were analyzed by gas chromatography. Ash was subjected to elemental analysis. These data were compared with the published values for the composition of dental plaque.
TI  - Predominant cultivable flora isolated from human root surface caries plaque.
AB  - Plaque samples were obtained from tooth surfaces exhibiting typical lesions of root surface caries and were immediately cultured by a continuous anaerobic procedure. The bacterial composition of root caries flora was determined on individual samples. Representative isolates from each specimen were characterized by morphological and physiological criteria. In addition, fluorescent antibody reagents were used to confirm the identification of Streptococcus mutans and Actinomyces viscosus. The plaque samples could be divided into two groups on the basis of the presence or absence of S. mutans in the plaque. In group I plaques, S. mutans comprised 30 percent of the total cultivable flora. S. sanguis was either not found or was present in very low number. In group II plaques, S. mutans was not detected, and S. sanguis formed 48 percent of the total plaque flora. A. viscosus was the dominant organism in all plaque samples, accounting for 47 percent of the group I isolates and 41 percent of the group II isolates.
TI  - Amino acid requirements of Streptococcus mutans and other oral streptococci.
AB  - The amino acid requirements of Streptococcus mutans strains AHT, OMZ-61, FA-1, BHT, GS-5, JC-2, Ingbritt, At6T, OMZ-176, 6715, Streptococcus salivarius HHT, Streptococcus sanguis OMZ-9, and strain 72x46 were determined in a chemically defined medium. When grown anaerobically in the presence of sodium carbonate (or bicarbonate for a few strains), few amino acids were required. All strains tested required cystine (or cystine) as a nutrient. Three strains (S. mutans OMZ-176, FA-1, and BHT) required glutamate (and/or glutamine). A third amino acid (lysine for S. mutans FA-1 and histidine for S. mutans OMZ-176) was required by two of the three strains which required glutamate. The amino acids mentioned above were required for all conditions of incubation (and inoculum) tested. The requirements for several other amino acids were conditional, that is, dependent on the incubation conditions and inoculum used. For example, when carbonate was not added, glutamate was required by S. mutans GS-5. Aerobic incubations, with carbonate or bicarbonate added, resluted in requirements for glutamate and leucine by several strains. With these incubation conditions, one strain required isoleucine (S. mutans FA-1), another valine (S. mutans AHT), and a third tyrosine (72x46). Aerobic incubations in the absence of carbonate or bicarbonate further increased the number of amino acids required by several strains. Furthermore, when stationary-phase cultures replaced exponentially growing cultures as an inoculum, several strains required additional amino acids, presumably for the initiation of growth.
TI  - Growth of several cariogenic strains of oral streptococci in a chemically defined medium.
AB  - A chemically defined medium in which Streptococcus mutans strains AHT, BHT, GS-5, JC-2, Ingbritt, At6T, At9T, 6715, and OMZ-176 and Streptococcus salivarius strain HHT grew rapidly to high turbidities was formulated. Maximal turbidities of each strain were observed after 8 to 12 h of aerobic growth. The subsequent transfer of exponentially growing cells into fresh medium resulted in growth at the same rate without lag. Growth of these strains occurred with rates at least one-half of those observed in an organic medium, such as Todd-Hewitt broth. S. mutans strains FA-1 and OMZ-61 grew at relatively slow rates in the defined medium, but more rapidly growth to higher turbidities of both strains was obtained when sodium bicarbonate was added to the medium. Streptococcus sanguis strain OMZ-9 and another group H streptococcus (strain 72 times 46) grew rapidly in the defined medium after the addition of sodium carbonate. The presence of carbonate or bicarbonate yielded higher turbidities of all the other strains, and the growth rates of several of the strains tested were also increased.

AB  - Incubation of saliva supernatant after three hours at 37 C revealed that salivary anionic proteins were susceptible to enzymatic attack by salivary enzymes not removable by centrifugation at 10,000 g. In the presence of washed suspensions of S mutans or S sanguis additional changes in electrophoretic behavior of anionic proteins occurred. Differences between organisms suggested a selectivity of attack on the anionic proteins.
TI  - Changing agglutination activities of salivary immunoglobulin A preparations against oral streptococci.
AB  - Immunoglobulin A (IgA) was prepared from samples of parotid saliva collected from two individuals over a 150-day period. Standardized solutions of the IgA were tested for agglutinating antibody activity against strains of streptococcus salivarius, S. sanguis, S. mitis, and S. mutans that had been isolated from a homologous individual on day 30 and preserved in the lyophilized state. The agglutinating activity of the standardized IgA preparations against these strains was found to change over time, whereas the agglutination patterns of IgA prepared from saliva samples collected 3 days apart were generally similar. Differences in agglutination titers were also observed between IgA samples prepared from saliva collected on day 0 and day 150. The data indicate that the oral cavity may harbor streptococci of different antigenic composition representing the same species at a given time and that parotid IgA agglutinating antibody against these serotypes changes over time.
TI  - Immunoelectron microscopic identification and localization of Streptococcus sanguis with peroxidase-labeled antibody: localization of surface antigens in pure cultures.
AB  - An indirect method of localizing antigens with horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibody was used to identify and localize surface antigens of Streptococcus sanguis at the ultrastructural level. An electron dense layer surrounding the cell wall could be distinguished without any additional electron microscope staining. This labeled layer represents an immune complex consisting of bacterial surface antigens, specific rabbit antisera, and peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit globulins. Although with undiluted antisera slight cross-reactions occurred with S. salivarius and S. miteor (mitis), these could be readily distinguished from the more intense homologous reaction by their patchiness and the difference in distribution of the label. These cross-reactions were eliminated by appropriate dilutions of the antiserum. No cross-reactions occurred with S. mutans, S. faecalis, Actinomyces species, or Bacterionema, microorganisms wents indicated that horseradish peroxidase can become non-specifically adsorbed to the membrane of certain bacterial cells. Appropriate controls must, therefore, be included for localization of membrane associated antigens with horseradish peroxidase.

TI  - Characteristics of Streptococcus milleri and Streptococcus mitior from infected dental root canals.
AB  - Morphological and physiological characteristics of 103 streptococcal isolates obtained from positive routine cultures of material from dental root canals at filling, were studied. The majority of the isolates were those which at a primary identification not fullfilled the criteria of enterococci, Strep. sanguis, Strep. mutans or Strep. salivarius. Only a few representative strains of the latter types were included in the study as a control of the method. The resemblance of the 103 isolates to 38 reference strains were assessed with numerical methods. The isolates formed 9 clusters with reference strains occurring in all but one. Of the isolates which it was intended to identify and characterize with numerical taxonomic analysis, all but one joined one of 3 clusters and were identified as Strep. milleri or Strep. mitior (mitis). The most useful cultural characteristics to dfferentiate the two species were growth on the sulphonamide containing MC-agar and 7.5% bile blood agar by Strep. milleri and production of hydrogen peroxide by Strep. mitior. The characteristics of the strains in the nine 80-phenons are given in Table 2. Other characteristics that appeared to be of interest for differentiating Strep. milleri from Strep. mitior and these two species from other viridans streptococci are underlined in Table 2. Strep. milleri seems not earlier to have been reported to occur in infected root canals. The occurrence of Strep. milleri is in agreement with the data given on serological groups found among streptococcal isolates from routine root canal cultures. Little is known about the occurrence and distribution of Strep. milleri in the human oral cavity, which therefore warrant further investigations.

TI  - Calcification of selected strains of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - Nine strains of cariogenic Streptococcus mutans and two strains of Streptococcus  sanguis were tested for their ability to form hydroxyapatite. The cells were examined by X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy for apatite crystals after growth in a synthetic calcification medium. Each of the test isolates, except for one strain of S. sanguis, produced intracellular mineral. Two strains of S. mutans formed both intra- and extracellular crystals. There was no apparent relationship between calcifiability and serotype.
TI  - Mutanolysin, bacteriolytic agent for cariogenic Streptococci: partial purification and properties.
AB  - Mutanolysin partially purified from the culture filtrate of Streptomyces globisporus 1829 consists of two main lytic enzymes with an isoelectric point near pH 8.5 and 10, respectively, and proteolytic enzyme is associated with the latter lytic enzyme. Mutanolysin exhibited maximal lytic activity at 60 C in the pH range 6.5 to 7.0 and was stable at 50 C in the acid range. N-bromosuccinimide caused complete inhibition of lytic activity at 1 mM, whereas calcium and magnesium ions at the same concentration caused activation. Mutanolysin had lytic or bactericidal activity against the living cells of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Actinomyces viscosus, which are considered to be etiologic agents of dental caries, but had no activity against S. aureus and all gram-negative strains tested. The lytic activity was well retained in human saliva. Digestion of the cell walls of S. mutans BHT by mutanolysin was accompanied by the liberation of free amino groups and reducing sugars. Mutanolysin may be expected to be a useful agent for dental caries control.

TI  - In vitro attachment of streptococci to the tooth surface.
AB  - The ability of Streptococcus strains to adhere to the tooth surface in vitro was  investigated. Polished enamel slabs, with and without acquired pellicles, were incubated with buffer suspensions of oral streptococci, and attached bacteria were counted under a microscope using incident light. Low numbers of bacteria adhered to uncoated enamel; the presence of an acquired pellicle significantly enhanced the attachment of all strains tested. The adherence of Streptococcus sanguis was significantly greater than that of Streptococcus salivarius, and both of these strains adhered in greater numbers than did Streptococcus mutans. When bacteria were suspended in whole saliva, the adherence of S. salivarius and S. mutans was inhibited, whereas the adherence of S. sanguis was enhanced in some experiments and inhibited in others. The adherence of S. sanguis and S. salivarius was consistently inhibited by parotid fluid; this inhibitory effect persisted after thorough washing and resonication of the bacterial cells. Incubation in oral fluids was associated with the attachment of bacterial clumps to the pellicle, and parallel investigation revealed agglutination of S. sanguis and S. salivarius by whole saliva and, in particular, parotid fluid. The results are discussed in terms of surface microecology, and are related to the development of dental plaque.
TI  - Relationship between the concentration of bacteria in saliva and the colonization of teeth in humans.
AB  - The relationship between the salivary concentration of bacteria and their number  that can be recovered from tooth surfaces has been studied in 12 human subjects. The mean salivary concentration of naturally occurring Steptococcus mutans and lactobacilli, determined on selective media, was 3.7 x 10(5) and 3.8 x 10(5) colony-forming units (CFU) per ml, respectively. In subjects with salivary concentrations of S. mutans of about 10(4) CFU/ml or less or about 10(5) CFU/ml or less of lactobacilli, these organisms could not be isolated from cleaned teeth after 2 to 3 h of oral exposure. In experiments with streptomycin-labeled S. sanguis cells held in the mouth for 15 min, the minimal salivary concentration required for their recovery from the teeth was about 10(3) CFU/ml. Both S. mutans and lactobacilli were found to be highly localized on teeth. This evidence suggests that the concentrations of S. mutans and lactobacilli generally present in saliva are insufficient for the initiation of their firm attachment to relatively nonretentive tooth surfaces. The low efficiency of their intraoral spread, as suggested by their highly localized distribution on teeth, or of their transmission between subjects may be essentially due to the interrelated factors bacterial affinity and number of colony-forming units available for attachment.

AB  - MM10 sucrose blood agar (MM10 SB agar), N(2)C agar, Schaedler agar (SH agar), and mitis salivarius agar (MS agar) were tested for their ability to recover human dental plaque flora by a continuous anaerobic procedure and by a conventional anaerobic method. MM10 SB agar yielded higher recovery of bacteria from plaque samples as determined by the enumeration of colony-forming units (CFU). The CFU on N(2)C agar, SH agar, and MS agar were lower than MM10 SB agar when the continuous anaerobic procedure was used. The superior performance of MM10 SB agar was much more apparent when used for the cultivation of dental plaque by the conventional anaerobic method. Under these conditions the counts were consistently higher on MM10 SB agar as compared to the other media tested. However, the differential counts of Streptococcus sanguis and S. mutans from carious plaque samples were in general comparable on all culture media. Deletion of blood from MM10 SB agar did not lower counts. The elimination of dithiothreitol from this medium resulted in a significantly lower recovery of bacteria from the plaque samples when cultured by the conventional anaerobic method. The storage of MM10 SB agar for varying periods of time aerobic conditions did not seem to affect its performance. These findings suggest that MM10 SB agar is an ideal culture medium for the isolation, nonselective enumeration, and differential counts of bacteria present in normal and disease-associated plaques.

AB  - Sucrose labeled in the fructosyl ((3)H) and glucosyl ((14)C) moieties was used to quantitate extracellular polysaccharide production and degradation by cariogenic and noncariogenic oral streptococci. All of the strains produced glucan and fructan. Streptococcus salivarius produced primarily fructan, whereas S. mutans and S. sanguis produced more glucan than fructan. The cariogenic streptococci could degrade the fructan produced by noncariogenic strains. Although the soluble glucans from all of the strains were sensitive to dextranase, the insoluble glucan from S. mutans could be distinguished from the S. sanguis insoluble glucan by its greater resistance to this enzyme.

AB  - The possible relationship between the ability of Streptococcus species to adhere  to oral epithelial cells and their natural distribution on epithelial surfaces within the mouth was studied. Strains of S. salivarius and S. sanguis, which are present in significant proportions on oral epithelial surfaces, were found to possess a definite capacity to adhere to epithelial cells obtained from cheek scrapings of humans, hamsters, and germ-free rats. In contrast, strains of S. mutans, which are found in only minor proportions, if at all, on oral epithelial surfaces exhibited feeble or no adherence to oral epithelial cells. S. salivarius cells attached well to human cheek cells over the range of pH 5 to 8. Its adherence was not found to be markedly influenced by saliva or by growth in sucrose broth. Several other types of bacteria were examined which also exhibited widely different abilities to attach to human cheek cells. Mixtures of streptomycin-labeled strains were introduced into the mouths of volunteers for study of the adherence of Streptococcus species to oral epithelial surfaces in vivo. Labeled S. salivarius and S. sanguis were recovered in high proportions from cheek and tongue surfaces, whereas the proportions of labeled S. mutans recovered from these surfaces were low in comparison to the original mixture. These data indicate that a correlation exists between the relative adherence of various Streptococcus species and their proportional distribution found naturally on oral epithelial surfaces. The ability of bacteria to adhere to surfaces is proposed as a critical ecological determinant affecting their colonization in environments with open surfaces exposed to bathing fluids.
