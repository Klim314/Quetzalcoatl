TI  - Construction of CoA-dependent 1-butanol synthetic pathway functions under aerobic conditions in Escherichia coli.
AB  - 1-Butanol is an important industrial platform chemical and an advanced biofuel. While various groups have attempted to construct synthetic pathways for 1-butanol production, efforts to construct a pathway that functions under aerobic conditions have met with limited success. Here, we constructed a CoA-dependent 1-butanol synthetic pathway that functions under aerobic conditions in Escherichia coli, by expanding the previously reported (R)-1,3-butanediol synthetic pathway. The pathway consists of phaA (acetyltransferase) and phaB (NADPH-dependent acetoacetyl-CoA reductase) from Ralstonia eutropha, phaJ ((R)-specific enoyl-CoA hydratase) from Aeromonas caviae, ter (trans-enoyl-CoA reductase) from Treponema denticola, bld (butylraldehyde dehydrogenase) from Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum, and inherent alcohol dehydrogenase(s) from E. coli. To evaluate the potential of this pathway for 1-butanol production, culture conditions, including volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient (kLa) and pH were optimized in a mini-jar fermenter. Under optimal conditions, 1-butanol was produced at a concentration of up to 8.60gL(-1) after 46h of fed-batch cultivation.
TI  - Aerobic bacterial microbiota isolated from the cloaca of the European pond turtle (Emys orbicularis) in Poland.
AB  - We conducted a comparative analysis of the aerobic cloacal bacteria of European pond turtles (Emys orbicularis) living in their natural environment and juvenile turtles reared under controlled conditions in a breeding center. We included 130 turtles in the study. The aerobic bacteria isolated from the cloaca of the juvenile turtles were less diverse and more prevalent than the bacteria isolated from free-living adults. We isolated 17 bacterial species from juvenile captive turtles, among which the dominant species were Cellulomonas flavigena (77/96), Enterococcus faecalis (96/96), Escherichia coli (58/96), and Proteus mirabilis (41/96). From the adult, free-living turtles, we isolated 36 bacterial species, some of which are a potential threat to public health (e.g., Salmonella enterica serovars Newport, Daytona, and Braenderup; Listeria monocytogenes; Yersinia enterocolitica; Yersinia ruckeri; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Vibrio fluvialis; and Serratia marcescens), and pathogens that are etiologic agents of diseases of ectothermic animals (e.g., Aeromonas sobria, Aeromonas caviae, Hafnia alvei, Edwardsiella tarda, and Citrobacter braakii; the last two species were isolated from both groups of animals). The cloacal bacterial biota of the European pond turtle was characterized by numerous species of bacteria, and its composition varied with turtle age and environmental conditions. The small number of isolated bacteria that are potential human pathogens may indicate that the European pond turtle is of relatively minor importance as a threat to public health.
TI  - On the mechanism underlying tellurite reduction by Aeromonas caviae ST dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase.
AB  - The dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (LpdA) from the tellurite-resistant bacterium  Aeromonas caviae ST reduces tellurite to elemental tellurium. To characterize this NADH-dependent activity, the A. caviae lpdA gene was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis and genes containing C45A, H322Y and E354K substitutions were individually transformed into Escherichia coli Deltalpd. Cells expressing the modified genes exhibited decreased pyruvate dehydrogenase, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase and TR activity regarding that observed with the wild type A. caviae lpdA gene. In addition, cells expressing the altered lpdA genes showed increased oxidative stress levels and tellurite sensitivity than those carrying the wild type counterpart. The involvement of Cys residues in LpdA's TR activity was analyzed using specific inhibitors that interact with catalytic cysteines and/or disulfide bridges such as aurothiomalate, zinc or nickel. TR activity of purified LpdA was drastically affected by these compounds. Since LpdA belongs to the flavoprotein family, the involvement of the FAD/NAD(P)(+)-binding domain in TR activity was determined. FAD removal from purified LpdA results in loss of TR activity, which was restored with exogenously added FAD. Substitutions in E354, involved in FAD/NADH binding, resulted in low TR activity because of flavin loss. Finally, changing H322 (involved in NAD(+)/NADH binding) by tyrosine also resulted in altered TR activity.
TI  - Phasin proteins activate Aeromonas caviae polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase but not Ralstonia eutropha PHA synthase.
AB  - In this study, we performed in vitro and in vivo activity assays of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthases (PhaCs) in the presence of phasin proteins (PhaPs), which revealed that PhaPs are activators of PhaC derived from Aeromonas caviae (PhaCAc). In in vitro assays, among the three PhaCs tested, PhaCAc was significantly activated when PhaPs were added at the beginning of polymerization (prepolymerization PhaCAc), whereas the prepolymerization PhaCRe (derived from Ralstonia eutropha) and PhaCDa (Delftia acidovorans) showed reduced activity with PhaPs. The PhaP-activated PhaCAc showed a slight shift of substrate preference toward 3-hydroxyhexanoyl-CoA (C6). PhaPAc also activated PhaCAc when it was added during polymerization (polymer-elongating PhaCAc), while this effect was not observed for PhaCRe. In an in vivo assay using Escherichia coli TOP10 as the host strain, the effect of PhaPAc expression on PHA synthesis by PhaCAc or PhaCRe was examined. As PhaPAc expression increased, PHA production was increased by up to 2.3-fold in the PhaCAc-expressing strain, whereas it was slightly increased in the PhaCRe-expressing strain. Taken together, this study provides evidence that PhaPs function as activators for PhaCAc both in vitro and in vivo but do not activate PhaCRe. This activating effect may be attributed to the new role of PhaPs in the polymerization reaction by PhaCAc.
TI  - Biosynthesis of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxy-4-methylvalerate) by recombinant Escherichia coli expressing leucine metabolism-related enzymes derived from Clostridium difficile.
AB  - An obligate anaerobic bacterium Clostridium difficile has a unique metabolic pathway to convert leucine to 4-methylvalerate, in which 4-methyl-2-pentenoyl-CoA (4M2PE-CoA) is an intermediate of this pathway. 4M2PE-CoA is also able to be converted to 3-hydroxy-4-methylvalerate (3H4MV), a branched side chain monomer unit, for synthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) copolymer. In this study, to synthesize 3H4MV-containing PHA copolymer from leucine, the leucine metabolism-related enzymes (LdhA and HadAIBC) derived from C. difficile and PHA biosynthesis enzymes (PhaPCJAc and PhaABRe) derived from Aeromonas caviae and Ralstonia eutropha were co-expressed in the codon usage-improved Escherichia coli. Under microaerobic culture conditions, this E. coli was able to synthesize P(3HB-co-12.2 mol% 3H4MV) from glucose with the supplementation of 1 g/L leucine. This strain also produced P(3HB-co-12.6 mol% 3H4MV) using the culture supernatant of leucine overproducer E. coli strain NS1391 as the medium for PHA production, achieving 3H4MV copolymer synthesis only from glucose. Furthermore, we tested the feasibility of the 3H4MV copolymer synthesis in E. coli strain NS1391 from glucose. The recombinant E. coli NS1391 was able to synthesize P(3HB-co-3.0 mol% 3H4MV) from glucose without any leucine supplementation. This study demonstrates the potential of the new metabolic pathway for 3H4MV synthesis using leucine metabolism-related enzymes from C. difficile.
TI  - AQU-1, a chromosomal class C beta-lactamase, among clinical Aeromonas dhakensis isolates: distribution and clinical significance.
AB  - Aeromonas dhakensis, a recently described Aeromonas sp. formerly called Aeromonas aquariorum, is associated with human infections. In this study, a chromosomal gene, blaAQU-1, was identified in A. dhakensis AAK1 that constitutes a 1143-bp open reading frame and is 87% identical to the gene encoding CepH in Aeromonas hydrophila. An Escherichia coli TOP10 cell transformant harbouring blaAQU-1 was resistant to cefotaxime but not to cefepime. mRNA expression of blaAQU-1 in the cefotaxime-resistant mutant strain AAK1m was 70-fold higher than in the wild strain AAK1. In all 16 A. dhakensis isolates (the major species of 51 consecutive Aeromonas blood isolates collected from June 1999 to June 2001) as well as in A. aquariorum MDC47(T) and A. hydrophila subsp. dhakensis LMG 19562(T), but not in the reference strains or clinical isolates of other A. hydrophila subspecies, Aeromonas caviae, Aeromonas veronii or Aeromonas enteropelogenes, blaAQU-1-related genes were detected by PCR. Overall, 13 (81%) of the 16 A. dhakensis blood isolates exhibited either cefotaxime resistance or the in vitro emergence of derepressed cefotaxime-resistant mutants. In vivo selection of an A. dhakensis resistant mutant was noted in a burn patient undergoing cefotaxime monotherapy. These observations suggest that AQU-1 is a chromosomal cephalosporinase in A. dhakensis. Cefotaxime monotherapy for severe A. dhakensis infections should be used cautiously.
TI  - [Possibility of the plasmid transfer within bacteria - compounds of the sulfidogenic microbial community].
AB  - Extrachromosomal elements have been found within the isolates of ammonifying and  iron-reducing bacteria obtained from the natural sulfidogenic community. These elements were small with size approximately 5-9 kb. Transconjugant strains Pseudomonas aeruginosa 27, P aeruginosa 28, P mendocina 29, Aeromonas hydrophila/caviae 30, harboured plasmids RP4 and R68.45 were obtained. The conjugation rate and retention of the plasmid within transconjugants were studied. P mendocina 29 cells with conjugation rate - 3.0*10(-6) CFU/ recipient cell, and P. aeruginosa 27 with rate 2.4*l0(-7) CFU/recipient cell were the most susceptible to R68.45 plasmid. The most stable retention is shown for transconjugated strains such as P aeruginosa 27 (R68.45), P. aeruginosa 27(RP4), P. mendocina 29(R68.45), A. hydrophila/caviae 30(RP4), A. hydrophila/caviae 30(R68.45). Thus, it was experimentally shown that corrosive-relevant bacteria form sulfidogenic microbial community which is able to accept extrachromosomal genetic elements from other bacteria when they act as recipients in conjugational process.
TI  - Skin and soft-tissue infections caused by Aeromonas species.
AB  - This study investigated the clinical characteristics of patients with skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs) due to Aeromonas species. Patients with SSTIs caused by Aeromonas species during the period from January 2009 to December 2011 were identified from a computerized database of a regional hospital in southern Taiwan. The medical records of these patients were retrospectively reviewed. A total of 129 patients with SSTIs due to Aeromonas species were identified. A. hydrophila (n = 77, 59.7 %) was the most common pathogen, followed by A. veronii biovar sobria (n = 22, 17.1 %), A. veronii biovar veronii (n = 20, 15.5 %), A. caviae (n = 9, 7.0 %), and A. schubertii (n = 1, 0.8 %). The most common isolates obtained from patients with polymicrobial infections were Klebsiella species (n = 33), followed by Enterococcus spp. (n = 24), Enterobacter spp. (n = 21), Escherichia coli (n = 17), Staphylococcus spp. (n = 17), Streptococcus spp. (n = 17), and Acinetobacter spp. (n = 15). Liver cirrhosis and concomitant bacteremia were more common among patients with monomicrobial Aeromonas SSTIs than among patients with polymicrobial SSTIs. Nine (7 %) patients required limb amputations. The in-hospital mortality rate was 1.6 %. In conclusion, Aeromonas species should be considered as important causative pathogens of SSTIs, and most infections are polymicrobial. In addition, the clinical presentation differs markedly between patients with monomicrobial and those with polymicrobial Aeromonas SSTIs.
TI  - Bacterial sepsis following prostatic biopsy.
AB  - PURPOSE: Despite the recent innovations, complications of prostate biopsy can occur. The aim of this study was a prospective monitoring of major septic complications occurring after transrectal prostate biopsy, to describe their causing agents, to report the clinical course of these patients, and to give guidelines based on our personal experience. METHODS: This prospective study was carried out between January 2009 and September 2010. Complications were evaluated by telephone interviews. RESULTS: Between January 2009 and September 2010, 447 (96.5%) completed the telephone interview. Urosepsis occurred in ten patients (2.2%) and in three cases evolved into septic shock. Of these ten patients, nine had a positive blood culture, of whom eight for Escherichia coli and one for Aeromonas hydrophila, Aeromonas caviae, and Aeromonas sobria. In seven cases, the E. coli isolated were resistant to fluoroquinolone and six produced an extended spectrum beta-lactamase. Six E. coli were classified as multidrug-resistant organisms. Of the 10 patients, one died after the onset of multiorgan failure. For the other nine, the mean time spent in the hospital was 9 days (range, 6-15 days). CONCLUSIONS: Escherichia coli are developing new drug resistances. Early recognition of patients who harbor MDRO E. coli in their rectum or in the urine could be an important strategy for preventing sepsis. If a patient who has recently undergone transrectal prostate biopsy shows clinical signs of sepsis in the 48 h, a multiresistant E. coli infection must be suspected. The patient must be admitted urgently to the hospital, and carbapenem antibiotic therapy should be started.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial effect of aqueous and ethanolic Moringa leaf extracts.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antibacterial effect of aqueous and ethanolic moringa  leaf extracts (Moringa oleifera) on the growth of gram-positive and negative bacteria. METHODS: Paper disks were soaked with 100, 200, 300 and 400 muL of extract at 20 g/180 mL and 10 g/190 mL. All extracts were tested against Escherichia coli (ATCC25922), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC25923), Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC29212), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC27853), Salmonella enteritidis (IH) and Aeromonas caviae. The susceptibility tests were performed using the modified disk diffusion method. RESULTS: The strains E. coli, P. aeruginosa and S. enteritidis (IH) were resistant to all treatments. In general, disks with 400 muL extract were the most efficient against S. aureus, V. parahaemolyticus, E. faecalis and A. caviae. CONCLUSIONS: The study indicates a promising potential for aqueous and ethanolic Moringa leaf extracts as alternative treatment of infections caused by the tested strains.
TI  - Aeromonas spp. induce apoptosis of epithelial cells through an oxidant-dependent  activation of the mitochondrial pathway.
AB  - We investigated interactions of Aeromonas caviae, Aeromonas veronii biotype sobria and Aeromonas hydrophila strains, isolated from faecal specimens of humans with gastroenteritis, with HT29 intestinal epithelial cells. All strains were found to be cytotoxic to the cells. Bacterial infection caused generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide radical (NO(.)). The maximal levels of ROS and NO(.) were 14 and 35 times, respectively, greater in cells infected with Aeromonas spp. than in those incubated with non-pathogenic Escherichia coli. The cells incubated with cytolytic enterotoxin isolated from A. veronii biotype sobria induced the highest level of ROS and caused the highest cytotoxicity. We observed that increased accumulation of intracellular ROS leads to a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)). Analyses of cellular morphology and DNA fragmentation revealed characteristic features of cells undergoing apoptosis. The process was dependent on the activation of caspases, and was completely blocked by the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. Treatment of infected HT29 cells with three distinct antioxidants prevented intracellular ROS production, mitochondrial damage and apoptosis. The Pearson linear test revealed positive correlations between apoptotic index at 24 h and percentage cytotoxicity, ROS production, NO(.) production and loss of DeltaPsi(m). This study has provided new insights into the mechanisms contributing to the development of Aeromonas-associated gastroenteritis. The results indicate that bacteria-induced apoptosis of epithelial cells results from mitochondrial depolarization due to oxidative stress.
TI  - Chimeric enzyme composed of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthases from Ralstonia eutropha and Aeromonas caviae enhances production of PHAs in recombinant Escherichia coli.
AB  - Chimeric enzymes composed of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthases from Ralstonia  eutropha (Cupriavidus necator) (PhaC(Re)) and Aeromonas caviae (PhaC(Ac)) were constructed. PhaC(Re) is known for its potent enzymatic activity among the characterized PHA synthases. PhaCAc has broad substrate specificity and synthesizes short-chain-length (SCL)/medium-chain-length (MCL) PHA. We attempted to create chimeric enzymes inheriting both of the advantageous properties. Among eight chimeras, AcRe12, with 26% of the N-terminal of PhaC(Ac) and 74% of the C-terminal of PhaC(Re), exhibited comparable P(3-hydroxybutyrate) accumulation as parental enzymes in Escherichia coli JM109. Thus, AcRe12 was applied to SCL/MCL PHA production using E. coli LS5218 as the host. AcRe12 accumulated higher amount of PHA (50 wt %) than the parental enzymes. Furthermore, the PHA consisted of 2 mol % 3-hydroxyhexanoate as well as 3-hydroxybutyrate. Therefore, the chimeric PHA synthase, AcRe12, inherited the character of both of the parental enzymes and thus exhibits improved enzymatic properties.
TI  - Expression of Aeromonas caviae ST pyruvate dehydrogenase complex components mediate tellurite resistance in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Potassium tellurite (K(2)TeO(3)) is harmful to most organisms and specific mechanisms explaining its toxicity are not well known to date. We previously reported that the lpdA gene product of the tellurite-resistant environmental isolate Aeromonas caviae ST is involved in the reduction of tellurite to elemental tellurium. In this work, we show that expression of A. caviae ST aceE, aceF, and lpdA genes, encoding pyruvate dehydrogenase, dihydrolipoamide transacetylase, and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, respectively, results in tellurite resistance and decreased levels of tellurite-induced superoxide in Escherichia coli. In addition to oxidative damage resulting from tellurite exposure, a metabolic disorder would be simultaneously established in which the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex would represent an intracellular tellurite target. These results allow us to widen our vision regarding the molecular mechanisms involved in bacterial tellurite resistance by correlating tellurite toxicity and key enzymes of aerobic metabolism.
TI  - Molecular diversity of class 1 integrons in human isolates of Aeromonas spp. from southern Taiwan.
AB  - This work studies antimicrobial resistance and class 1 integrons of Aeromonas spp. in human isolates from southern Taiwan. PCR amplification and DNA sequence analyses were performed to characterize the gene cassette regions of the class 1 integron in 204 isolates of Aeromonas hydrophila, 36 isolates of A. sobria, 23 isolates of A. veronii, and 4 isolates of A. caviae. By using Southern hybridization with an intI1 probe to determine the presence of class 1 integrons in the 9 isolates of Aeromonas spp. harboring plasmid DNA, only 2 isolates, one A. veronii AV69 harboring 176-kb plasmid DNA, and one A. hydrophila AH207 harboring 149-kb plasmid DNA were identified. A conjugation experiment was carried out with 2 isolates of A. veronii AV69 and A. hydrophila AH207. Only one transconjugant of Escherichia coli AH207, containing 149-kb plasmids obtained from A. hydrophila AH207, was identified. ERIC-PCR analysis was performed to analyze the genetic relatedness in all isolates of Aeromonas spp. that carry class 1 integrons. The results of cluster analysis in this experiment revealed that none of these isolates were clonal, which may indicate that they were not related to the outbreak. Among the 267 isolates tested, class 1 integrons were detected in 37 isolates (13.9%) of Aeromonas spp. from humans. No class 2 or class 3 integrons were detected in this study. Gene cassette structures were identified in 30 (81.0%) of 37 isolates of Aeromonas spp. containing class 1 integrons. The gene cassette of dfrA12-orfF-aadA2 was the most prevalent in the gene cassette array (16.0%), followed by arr3-aacA4 (13.3%) and dfr2d-catB3-aadA1 (10.0%). Four novel arrays of gene cassettes were also identified, namely, dfr2d-catB3-aadA1, aadA1-aac(6')-II, aadA4a, and aac(6')-II-blaOXA-21-catB3. This is the first report of Aeromonas spp. isolates from humans.
TI  - The dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase of Aeromonas caviae ST exhibits NADH-dependent tellurite reductase activity.
AB  - Potassium tellurite (K(2)TeO(3)) is extremely toxic for most forms of life and only a limited number of organisms are naturally resistant to the toxic effects of this compound. Crude extracts prepared from the environmental isolate Aeromonas caviae ST catalize the in vitro reduction of TeO32- in a NADH-dependent reaction. Upon fractionation by ionic exchange column chromatography three major polypeptides identified as the E1, E2, and E3 components of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex were identified in fractions exhibiting tellurite-reducing activity. Tellurite reductase and pyruvate dehydrogenase activities co-eluted from a Sephadex gel filtration column. To determine which component(s) of the PDH complex has tellurite reductase activity, the A. caviae ST structural genes encoding for E1 (aceE), E2 (aceF), and E3 (lpdA) were independently cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli and their gene products purified. Results indicated that tellurite reductase activity lies almost exclusively in the E3 component, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase. The E3 component of the PDH complex from E. coli, Zymomonas mobilis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Geobacillus stearothermophilus also showed NADH-dependent tellurite reductase in vitro suggesting that this enzymatic activity is widely distributed among microorganisms.
TI  - Cloning, expression, and transglycosylation reaction of Paenibacillus sp. strain  W-61 xylanase 1.
AB  - A xylanase gene, xyn1, which encodes Paenibacillus sp. strain W-61 xylanase 1 (Xyn1), was cloned in Escherichia coli. xyn1 encodes 211 amino acid residues, including 28 amino acid residues of a signal peptide. The deduced amino acid sequence of the mature Xyn1 showed 95.7%, 84.0%, and 83.7% identity to family 11 xylanases of Aeromonas caviae ME-1, Paenibacillus sp., and Bacillus stearothermophilus respectively. The physico-chemical properties of recombinant Xyn1 were very similar to those of intact Xyn1, except for the molecular mass. The pattern of xylooligosaccharides generated by rXyn1 was investigated by fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE). The degradation rate of xylohexaose by rXyn1 increased markedly as compared with that of xylopentaose. Xylohexaose had a single preferential point of cleavage by rXyn1. On the basis of the pattern of action of xylooligosaccharides, the number of subsites was estimated to be six. The catalytic site was located between the third and the fourth subsites from non-reducing end.
TI  - [Identification of closely related bacteria via phylogenetic methods].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To differentiate closely related pathogenic bacteria via phylogenetic  method on the basis of gyrB gene sequences. METHODS: GyrB sequences of 19 strains of E.coli, 13 Shigella spp. 2 Aeromonas caviae, 2 Aeromonas hydrophilia,1 Aeromonas veronii were determined and combined with sequences retrieved from public databases to construct phylogenetic trees. For each sequence tested, the identification deduced from the clustering relation of sequences was compared with the phenetic identification. RESULTS: All the tested sequences, except those of Shigella boydii and Shigella dysenteriae, were corresponded with the 5 closest sequences on the tree at the species level. While the BLAST queries returned some other bacteria organisms or undetermined entries. CONCLUSION: Phylogenetics displays good discriminative power in bacterial sequences differentiation.
TI  - Construction of a chimeric aminopeptidase by a combination of gene shuffling and  mutagenesis.
AB  - Three chimeric genes were constructed by gene shuffling of aminopeptidases from Aeromonas caviae and Vibrio proteolyticus. Although expressed chimeric enzymes formed inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli, the introduction of two amino acid mutations into the chimeric genes by site-saturated mutagenesis and a random mutation on error-prone PCR resulted in solubilization of the chimeric enzyme. In addition, active chimeric enzyme showed a different thermostability and thermoactivity to parental enzymes.
TI  - Poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate] formation in Escherichia coli from glucose through an enoyl-CoA hydratase-mediated pathway.
AB  - In this study, a new metabolic pathway for the synthesis of poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate] [P(3HB)] was constructed in a recombinant Escherichia coli strain that utilized forward and reverse reactions catalyzed by two substrate-specific enoyl-CoA hydratases, R-hydratase (PhaJ) and S-hydratase (FadB), to epimerize (S)-3HB-CoA to (R)-3HB-CoA via a crotonyl-CoA intermediate. The R-hydratase gene (phaJ(Ac)) from Aeromonas caviae was coexpressed with the PHA synthase gene (phaC(Re)) and 3-ketothiolase gene (phaA(Re)) from Ralstonia eutropha in fadR mutant E. coli strains (CAG18497 and LS5218), which had constitutive levels of the beta-oxidation multienzyme FadB(Ec). When grown on glucose as the sole carbon source, the cells accumulated P(3HB) up to an amount 6.5 wt% of the dry cell weight, whereas the control cells without phaJ(Ac) or fadR mutation accumulated significantly smaller amounts of P(3HB). These results suggest that PhaJ(Ac) and FadB(Ec) played an important role in supplying monomers for P(3HB) synthesis in the pathway. Furthermore, by using this pathway, a P(3HB)-concentration-dependent fluorescent staining screening technique was developed to rapidly identify cells that possess active R-hydratase.
TI  - Occurrence and diversity of integrons and beta-lactamase genes among ampicillin-resistant isolates from estuarine waters.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to assess the occurrence and molecular diversity of beta-lactamase genes and integrons among Gram-negative ampicillin-resistant bacteria from Ria de Aveiro. Ampicillin-resistant isolates were selected and subjected to genotyping using REP-PCR. Representatives from each REP pattern were affiliated with the following taxa by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene: Aeromonas caviae, A. hydrophila, A. media, A. molluscorum, A. veronii, A. salmonicida, Aeromonas sp., Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas sp., Escherichia coli, Escherichia sp., Shigella sonnei, Shigella sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Raoultella ornithinolytica, R. terrigena, R. planticola, Citrobacter freundii, Morganella morganii and Enterobacter sp. Isolates affiliated with genera Escherichia or Shigella were identified as Escherichia coli using phenotypic-based tests. PCR was used to assess beta-lactamase encoding sequences (bla(TEM), bla(SHV), bla(CARB), bla(CTX-M), bla(IMP), bla(VIM), bla(CphA/IMIS), bla(OXA-A), bla(OXA-B), bla(OXA-C)), class 1 and class 2 integrases, and integron variable regions. Sequence analysis of PCR products was performed. beta-Lactamase genes were detected in 77.8% of the Enterobacteriaceae and in 10.5% of the Aeromonas. The most frequently detected gene was bla(TEM), followed by bla(SHV,)bla(OXA-B), bla(CphA/IMIS) and bla(CARB). Retrieved sequences shared high homology with previously described beta-lactamases. The intI1 gene was present in 29.6% of the Enterobacteriaceae and in 21% of the Aeromonas isolates. The intI2 gene was present in 4 isolates. A total of 13 cassettes included in 12 different cassette arrays were identified. The most frequently found resistance gene cassettes were aadA variants. Previous investigations based on cultivation-independent approaches revealed higher molecular diversity among beta-lactamase-encoding sequences in this estuary. This fact reinforces the hypothesis that cultivation-dependent approaches may underestimate the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes in environmental samples and may introduce bias in the recovery of their molecular variants.
TI  - Serogroups, K1 antigen, and antimicrobial resistance patterns of Aeromonas spp. strains isolated from different sources in Mexico.
AB  - A total of 221 strains of Aeromonas species isolated in Mexico from clinical (161), environmental (40), and food (20) samples were identified using the automated system bioMerieux-Vitek. Antisera for serogroups O1 to 044 were tested using the Shimada and Sakazaki scheme. The K1 antigen was examined using as antiserum the O7:K1C of Escherichia coli. Besides, we studied the antimicrobial patterns according to Vitek AutoMicrobic system. Among the 161 clinical strains 60% were identified as A. hydrophila, 20.4% as A. caviae, and 19.25% as A. veronii biovar sobria. Only A. hydrophila and A. veronii biovar sobria were found in food (55 and 90% respectively) and environmental sources (45 and 10% respectively). Using "O" antisera, only 42.5% (94/221) of the strains were serologically identified, 55% (121/221) were non-typable, and 2.5% (6/221) were rough strains. Twenty-two different serogroups were found, O14, O16, O19, O22, and O34 represented 60% of the serotyped strains. More than 50% of Aeromonas strain examined (112/221) expressed K1 encapsulating antigen; this characteristic was predominant among Aeromonas strains of clinical origin. Resistance to ampicillin/sulbactam and cephazolin was detected in 100 and 67% of Aeromonas strain tested for their susceptibility to antibiotics. In conclusion, antibiotic-resistant Aeromonas species that possess the K1 encapsulating antigen and represent serogroups associated with clinical syndrome in man are not uncommon among Aeromonas strains isolated from clinical, food and environmental sources in Mexico.
TI  - Rabbit meat as a source of bacterial foodborne pathogens.
AB  - Even though worldwide production of rabbit meat is >1,000,000 tons, little information is available for rabbit meat microbiology. This study provides data on the prevalence of Salmonella, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Yersinia enterocolitica, Listeria spp., motile Aeromonas spp., and Staphylococcus aureus on rabbit meat. A total of 24 rabbit carcasses from two abattoirs and 27 rabbit meat packages from supermarket displays were examined. In addition to culturing methods, associated virulence genes were investigated by PCR in suspect isolates and samples. Neither Salmonella nor E. coli O157:H7 was detected. All samples were negative for virulence-associated invA, stx1, and stx2 genes. At one abattoir, two carcasses (3.9%) carried Y. enterocolitica yst-, and two were positive for the yst gene, although viable Y. enterocolitica cells were not recovered from these samples. Seven samples (13.7%) were contaminated with Listeria. Of them, three were positive for hly and iap genes (Listeria monocytogenes hly+ / iap+), two carried Listeria seeligeri, one carried Listeria ivanovii, and one carried Listeria innocua. For detectable motile Aeromonas spp. (average count, 1.77 +/- 0.62 log CFU/g), the contamination rate was 35.3%, although ca. 90% of the samples were positive for the aerA and/or hlyA genes. The majority of aeromonad isolates were Aeromonas hydrophila aerA+ / hlyA+. Aeromonas caviae, Aeromonas popoffii, Aeromonas schubertii, and the two biovars of Aeromonas veronii were also isolated. The prevalence of S. aureus contamination (average count, 1.37 +/- 0.79 log CFU/g) was 52.9%. Among 27 S. aureus isolates, two harbored genes for staphylococcal enterotoxin B (seb), and two harbored genes for staphylococcal enterotoxin C (sec). The remaining isolates were negative for sea, seb, sec, sed, and see.
TI  - Processing of XynE (110-kDa) of Aeromonas caviae ME-1 to 72-kDa xylanase in Escherichia coli transformant.
AB  - An extracellular 72-kDa xylanase from an Escherichia coli transformant that harbored pXED30 carrying xynE of Aeromonas caviae ME-1 was purified by extraction following SDS-PAGE to electrophoretic homogeneity. The analysis of N-terminal 10 amino acid residues (Gly-Ala-Arg-Ala-Gln-Ala-Ala-Ala-Asp-Val) revealed a 72-kDa product derived by the cleavage of Gly26-Gly27 at the N-terminal region of 110 kDa XynE. The 72-kDa xylanase from A. caviae ME-1 was found to have the same sequence as that of the N-terminal 10 amino acid residues. When OmpT-deficient E. coli mutants were used as hosts, the 72-kDa xylanase was detected in cell-free extracts, but not in the culture supernatant, suggesting that OmpT is not involved in the cleavage at the C-terminal region, but is involved in the secretion of 72-kDa xylanase to the culture medium.
TI  - A cytoplasmic xylanase (XynX) of Aeromonas caviae ME-1 is released from the cytoplasm to the periplasm by osmotic downshock.
AB  - Aeromonas caviae ME-1 is a multiple xylanase-producing gram-negative bacterium which was isolated from the gut contents of a wild silkworm, Samia cynthia pryeri. One of the xylanases produced by A. caviae ME-1, XynX (38 kDa, family 10 xylanase), hydrolyzes xylan to xylobiose and xylotetraose as final degradation products. Generally, xylanases are extracellular or cell surface enzymes. However, XynX is not exported to the extracellular fluid by A. caviae ME-1 and an Escherichia coli transformant harboring the xynX gene. In this study, we investigated the intracellular localization of XynX in A. caviae ME-1 and an E. coli transformant. XynX was found in the cytoplasm when the cells were grown under normal culture conditions. However, XynX was released from the cytoplasm to the periplasm during osmotic downshock. This release of XynX in the E. coli transformant was blocked in the presence of gadolinium chloride, which has been reported to be an inhibitor of bacterial mechanosensitive channels.
TI  - The processing of high-molecular-weight xylanase (XynE, 110 kDa) from Aeromonas caviae ME-1 to 60-kDa xylanase (XynE60) in Escherichia coli and purification and characterization of XynE60.
AB  - A xylanase gene (xynE) encoding XynE (110 kDa) was cloned from a lambda phage genomic library of Aeromonas caviae ME-1 which is a multiple-xylanase-producing bacterium. Upon nucleotide sequence analysis, we found that xynE comprises 2823 by and encodes a protein of 941 amino acid residues (104,153 Da), which was similar to endo-beta-1,4-xylanases which are categorized to glycosyl hydrolase family 10. An Escherichia coli transformant that harbored pXED30 carrying xynE produced 110-, 84-, 72-, and 66-kDa xylanases in the cell-free extract, and 72- and 66-kDa xylanases in the culture supernatant. We purified the 66-kDa xylanase to electrophoretic homogeneity from a culture supernatant by a series of column chromatographies. The calculated molecular mass of the purified xylanase determined by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was 60,154.50 Da, and the xylanase was designated XynE60. Analysis of the N-terminal 10 amino acid residues and the determined molecular mass of XynE60 revealed that XynE60 is a product processed at the Gly26-Gly27, and Thr565-Ala566 sites of XynE by proteolytic cleavage. XynE60 showed optimal activity at 55 degrees C and pH 8.0, and was stable below 45 degrees C and at pH 7.0-8.5. The K(m) and V(max) of XynE60 were calculated to be 8.1 mg/ml and 6897 nkat/mg, respectively.
TI  - Enhancement of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) production in the transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana by the in vitro evolved highly active mutants of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase from Aeromonas caviae.
AB  - In this study, the enhancement of photosynthetic PHA production was achieved using the highly active mutants of PHA synthase created by the in vitro evolutionally techniques. The wild-type and mutated PHA synthase genes from Aeromonas caviae were introduced into Arabidopsis thaliana together with the NADPH-dependent acetoacetyl-CoA reductase gene from Ralstonia eutropha. Expression of the highly active mutated PHA synthase genes, N149S and D171G, led to an 8-10-fold increase in PHA content in the T1 transgenic Arabidopsis, compared to plants harboring the wild-type PHA synthase gene. In homozygous T2 progenies, PHA content was further increased up to 6.1 mg/g cell dry weight. GC/MS analysis of the purified PHA from the transformants revealed that these PHAs were poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) [P(3HB-co-3HV)] copolymers consisting of 0.2-0.8 mol % 3HV. The monomer composition of the P(3HB-co-3HV) copolymers synthesized by the wild-type and mutated PHA synthases reflected the substrate specificities observed in Escherichia coli. These results indicate that in vitro evolved PHA synthases can enhance the productivity of PHA and regulate the monomer composition in transgenic plants.
TI  - Complete nucleotide sequence of the conjugative tetracycline resistance plasmid pFBAOT6, a member of a group of IncU plasmids with global ubiquity.
AB  - This study presents the first complete sequence of an IncU plasmid, pFBAOT6. This plasmid was originally isolated from a strain of Aeromonas caviae from hospital effluent (Westmorland General Hospital, Kendal, United Kingdom) in September 1997 (G. Rhodes, G. Huys, J. Swings, P. McGann, M. Hiney, P. Smith, and R. W. Pickup, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 66:3883-3890, 2000) and belongs to a group of related plasmids with global ubiquity. pFBAOT6 is 84,748 bp long and has 94 predicted coding sequences, only 12 of which do not have a possible function that has been attributed. Putative replication, maintenance, and transfer functions have been identified and are located in a region in the first 31 kb of the plasmid. The replication region is poorly understood but exhibits some identity at the protein level with replication proteins from the gram-positive bacteria Bacillus and Clostridium. The mating pair formation system is a virB homologue, type IV secretory pathway that is similar in its structural organization to the mating pair formation systems of the related broad-host-range (BHR) environmental plasmids pIPO2, pXF51, and pSB102 from plant-associated bacteria. Partitioning and maintenance genes are homologues of genes in IncP plasmids. The DNA transfer genes and the putative oriT site also exhibit high levels of similarity with those of plasmids pIPO2, pXF51, and pSB102. The genetic load region encompasses 54 kb, comprises the resistance genes, and includes a class I integron, an IS630 relative, and other transposable elements in a 43-kb region that may be a novel Tn1721-flanked composite transposon. This region also contains 24 genes that exhibit the highest levels of identity to chromosomal genes of several plant-associated bacteria. The features of the backbone of pFBAOT6 that are shared with this newly defined group of environmental BHR plasmids suggest that pFBAOT6 may be a relative of this group, but a relative that was isolated from a clinical bacterial environment rather than a plant-associated bacterial environment.
TI  - Adhesive properties of a LamB-like outer-membrane protein and its contribution to Aeromonas veronii adhesion.
AB  - AIMS: To identify and characterize nonfimbrial proteins from Aeromonas veronii involved in the attachment to epithelial cells in vitro. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two Aer. veronii mucin- and lactoferrin-binding proteins with molecular masses of 37 and 48 kDa were identified by Western blot analysis. According to its N-terminal amino acid sequence, the 48-kDa protein was identified as Omp48, an outer-membrane protein similar to LamB of Escherichia coli. LamB is a well-known porin involved in maltose transport across the outer membrane in E. coli. In a microtitre plate assay, Omp48 bound to the immobilized extracellular matrix proteins collagen and fibronectin, and the mucin- and lactoferrin-binding activity was confirmed. Adhesion of Omp48 to mucin, lactoferrin and collagen was diminished by preincubation with homologous glycoproteins or other carbohydrates, suggesting a putative Omp48 lectin-like binding domain. Anti-Omp48 antiserum significantly inhibited the Aer. veronii adhesion to confluent HeLa cell monolayers and pretreatment of cells with purified Omp48 elicited competitive inhibition of adhesion. Similarly, cross-inhibition of Aer. hydrophila and Aer. caviae adhesion was achieved with the same treatments, indicating the existence of a conserved surface protein among these species. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data indicate that Omp48 is involved in Aer. veronii adhesion to epithelial cells and might be an alternative adhesion factor of this micro-organism. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The adhesive potential of Aeromonas spp. is correlated with pathogenicity; however, the adhesion mechanism is complex and not well understood. This study provides evidence of a putative adhesion factor that might be contributing to pathogenicity of Aer. veronii and could be used for vaccine development.
TI  - Aeromonas spp associated with children's diarrhoea in Tehran: a case-control study.
AB  - The study sought a possible pathogenic role for Aeromonas spp in Tehranian children presenting with diarrhoea. During a 10-month period (February to October 2001), 310 children <10 years of age with diarrhoea and a group of 310 age- and sex-matched controls were selected. Both groups were investigated for diarrhoeal pathogens. Of 310 children who presented with acute diarrhoea, Aeromonas spp was isolated from 14 (4.5%) (A. veronii biovar sobria 8, A. caviae 5 and A. hydrophila 1). The isolation rate was significantly higher than in the controls (p<0.001). Other enteropathogens were also more commonly isolated in children with diarrhoea: 57 (18.4%) Shigella spp (p<0.0001), 8 (2.6%) Salmonella spp (p<0.01), 7 (2.3%) enteropathogenic E. coli (p<0.05) and 8 (2.6%) Giardia lamblia (p<0.01). No enteropathogens were isolated in the control group. Dysentery was the dominant clinical feature in children positive for Aeromonas spp.
TI  - Coexpression of genetically engineered 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III (fabH) and polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase (phaC) genes leads to short-chain-length-medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoate copolymer production from glucose in Escherichia coli JM109.
AB  - Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) can be divided into three main types based on the sizes of the monomers incorporated into the polymer. Short-chain-length (SCL) PHAs consist of monomer units of C3 to C5, medium-chain-length (MCL) PHAs consist of monomer units of C6 to C14, and SCL-MCL PHAs consist of monomers ranging in size from C4 to C14. Although previous studies using recombinant Escherichia coli have shown that either SCL or MCL PHA polymers could be produced from glucose, this study presents the first evidence that an SCL-MCL PHA copolymer can be made from glucose in recombinant E. coli. The 3-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase III gene (fabH) from E. coli was modified by saturation point mutagenesis at the codon encoding amino acid 87 of the FabH protein sequence, and the resulting plasmids were cotransformed with either the pAPAC plasmid, which harbors the Aeromonas caviae PHA synthase gene (phaC), or the pPPAC plasmid, which harbors the Pseudomonas sp. strain 61-3 PHA synthase gene (phaC1), and the abilities of these strains to accumulate PHA from glucose were assessed. It was found that overexpression of several of the mutant fabH genes enabled recombinant E. coli to induce the production of monomers of C4 to C10 and subsequently to produce unusual PHA copolymers containing SCL and MCL units. The results indicate that the composition of PHA copolymers may be controlled by the monomer-supplying enzyme and further reinforce the idea that fatty acid biosynthesis may be used to supply monomers for PHA production.
TI  - Cloning, expression, and cell surface localization of Paenibacillus sp. strain W-61 xylanase 5, a multidomain xylanase.
AB  - We have shown that a xylan-degrading bacterium, W-61, excretes multiple xylanases, including xylanase 5 with a molecular mass of 140 kDa. Here, we emend the previously used classification of the bacterium (i.e., Aeromonas caviae W-61) to Paenibacillus sp. strain W-61 on the basis of the nucleotide sequence of the 16S rRNA gene, and we clone and express the xyn5 gene encoding xylanase 5 (Xyn5) in Escherichia coli and study the subcellular localization of Xyn5. xyn5 encodes 1,326 amino acid residues, including a 27-amino-acid signal sequence. Sequence analysis indicated that Xyn5 comprises two family 22 carbohydrate-binding modules (CBM), a family 10 catalytic domain of glycosyl hydrolases, a family 9 CBM, a domain similar to the lysine-rich region of Clostridium thermocellum SdbA, and three S-layer-homologous (SLH) domains. Recombinant Xyn5 bound to a crystalline cellulose, Avicel PH-101, while an N-terminal 90-kDa fragment of Xyn5, which lacks the C-terminal half of the family 9 CBM, did not bind to Avicel PH-101. Xyn5 was cell bound, and the cell-bound protein was digested by exogenous trypsin to produce immunoreactive and xylanolytic fragments with molecular masses of 80 and 60 kDa. Xyn5 was exclusively distributed in the cell envelope fraction consisting of a peptidoglycan-containing layer and an associated S layer. Thus, Paenibacillus sp. strain W-61 Xyn5 is a cell surface-anchored modular xylanase possessing a functional cellulose-binding module and SLH domains. Possible cooperative action of multiple xylanases produced by strain W-61 is discussed on the basis of the modular structure of Xyn5.
TI  - Epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of acute diarrhea with emphasis on Entamoeba histolytica infections in preschool children in an urban slum of Dhaka, Bangladesh.
AB  - The epidemiology, clinical features, nutritional status, and causative agents of  diarrhea were studied in 289 Bangladeshi children (147 boys and 142 girls) 2-5 years old. The use of improved diagnostic tests for amebiasis enabled for the first time analysis of the contribution of Entamoeba histolytica to total diarrheal illness in this community setting. The average incidence rate of diarrhea was 1.8/child-year, and the average number of diarrheal days was 3.7 days/child-year over an average observation period of 2.8 years/child. Seventy-five percent of the diarrheal episodes were < or = 2 days in duration. Persistent diarrhea was relatively uncommon (0.2% of the children) and chronic diarrhea was observed in only one episode. Compared with malnourished and/or stunted children, better-nourished children experienced significantly fewer diarrheal episodes. The diarrheal incidence rate for children with blood group A was significantly less that that of the children with blood groups O and AB. The most frequent bacterial enteropathogens isolated from diarrheal stool specimens were enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (9%) and Aeromonas species (9%), followed by Plesimonas shigelloides (4%) and Shigella flexneri (3.8%). Rotavirus was the most common viral agent isolated from diarrheal stool samples (5%). Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium parvum, and E. histolytica were identified in 11%, 8.4%, and 8%, respectively, of the diarrheal stool specimens. Dysentery was observed in 7.7% of all diarrheal episodes. The most common pathogens isolated from dysenteric stool were S. flexneri (11.6%), Aeromonas sp. (10%), E. histolytica (8.7%), Campylobacter jejunii (5.8%), P. shigelloides (4.3%), and A. caviae (4.3%). The overall incidence rate of E. histolytica-associated diarrhea was 0.08/child-year. Visible blood and hemoccult test-detected blood loss was found in 7% and 25%, respectively, of cases of E. histolytica-associated diarrhea. Children who had recovered from a diarrheal episode with E. histolytica, but not E. dispar, had half the chance of developing subsequent E. histolytica-associated diarrhea, consistent with the development of species-specific acquired immunity. In conclusion, the use of modern diagnostic tests demonstrated that E. histolytica contributed to overall morbidity from diarrheal illness. Understanding the etiology, frequency, and consequences of acute diarrhea in children from a developing country should aid in the design of interventions to improve child health.
TI  - Alteration of chain length substrate specificity of Aeromonas caviae R-enantiomer-specific enoyl-coenzyme A hydratase through site-directed mutagenesis.
AB  - Aeromonas caviae R-specific enoyl-coenzyme A (enoyl-CoA) hydratase (PhaJ(Ac)) is  capable of providing (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA with a chain length of four to six carbon atoms from the fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway for polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthesis. In this study, amino acid substitutions were introduced into PhaJ(Ac) by site-directed mutagenesis to investigate the feasibility of altering the specificity for the acyl chain length of the substrate. A crystallographic structure analysis of PhaJ(Ac) revealed that Ser-62, Leu-65, and Val-130 define the width and depth of the acyl-chain-binding pocket. Accordingly, we targeted these three residues for amino acid substitution. Nine single-mutation enzymes and two double-mutation enzymes were generated, and their hydratase activities were assayed in vitro by using trans-2-octenoyl-CoA (C(8)) as a substrate. Three of these mutant enzymes, L65A, L65G, and V130G, exhibited significantly high activities toward octenoyl-CoA than the wild-type enzyme exhibited. PHA formation from dodecanoate (C(12)) was examined by using the mutated PhaJ(Ac) as a monomer supplier in recombinant Escherichia coli LS5218 harboring a PHA synthase gene from Pseudomonas sp. strain 61-3 (phaC1(Ps)). When L65A, L65G, or V130G was used individually, increased molar fractions of 3-hydroxyoctanoate (C(8)) and 3-hydroxydecanoate (C(10)) units were incorporated into PHA. These results revealed that Leu-65 and Val-130 affect the acyl chain length substrate specificity. Furthermore, comparative kinetic analyses of the wild-type enzyme and the L65A and V130G mutants were performed, and the mechanisms underlying changes in substrate specificity are discussed.
TI  - Sequence analysis and biochemical characterisation of chromosomal CAV-1 (Aeromonas caviae), the parental cephalosporinase of plasmid-mediated AmpC 'FOX' cluster.
AB  - Aeromonas caviae CIP 74.32 was resistant to amoxicillin, ticarcillin and cephalothin, and susceptible to cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam and imipenem. This strain produced a cephalosporinase (pI 7.2) and an oxacillinase (pI 8.5). The cephalosporinase gene cav-1 was cloned and sequenced. Unlike A. caviae donor, Escherichia coli pNCE50 transformant producing CAV-1 beta-lactamase was resistant to cefoxitin. The deduced protein sequence CAV-1 contained 382 amino acids, and shared >96% homology with FOX-1 to FOX-5 cephalosporinase. CAV-1 presented only two amino acid substitutions (Thr270Ser and Arg271Ala) with FOX-1. CAV-1 is the chromosomal putative ancestor of the FOX family, a cluster of class C/group 1 plasmidic cephalosporinases spreading in Klebsiella and E. coli clinical isolates via conjugative plasmids.
TI  - Enhanced production of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) via manipulating the fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway in E. coli.
AB  - Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase gene (yafH) of Escherichia coli was expressed together with polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase gene (phaC(Ac)) and (R)-enoyl-CoA hydratase gene (phaJ(Ac)) from Aeromonas caviae. The expression plasmids were introduced into E. coli JM109, DH5 alpha and XL1-blue, respectively. Compared with the strains harboring only phaC(Ac) and phaJ(Ac), all recombinant E. coli strains harboring yafH, phaC(Ac) and phaJ(Ac) accumulated at least four times more poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) (PHBHHx). Cell dry weights produced by all recombinants containing yafH were also considerably higher than that without yafH. The addition of acrylic acid which serves as inhibitor for beta-oxidation and may lead to more precursor supply for PHA synthesis did not result in improved PHBHHx production compared with that of the overexpression of yafH. It appeared that the overexpression of acyl-CoA dehydrogenase gene (yafH) enhanced the supply of enoyl-CoA which is the substrate of (R)-enoyl-CoA hydratase. With the enhanced precursor supply, the recombinants accumulated more PHBHHx.
TI  - Bacteriocin-like substance (BLS) production in Aeromonas hydrophila water isolates.
AB  - 30 Aeromonas hydrophila water isolates were tested for bacteriocin-like substance (BLS) production using a target panel of closely related microorganisms and other Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including food-borne pathogens. A. hydrophila showed antibacterial activity against one or more indicator microorganisms, but the activity emerged only with non-phylogenetically related genera or species. In particular all A. hydrophila showed antibacterial activity against one or more of the tested Staphylococcus strains, five against Listeria spp. (Listeria seeligeri, Listeria welshimeri and Listeria ivanovii), and eight presented a weak antagonistic activity towards Streptococcus agalactiae and Lactobacillus spp. Inhibitory activity was not observed against the other Gram-positive (Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria innocua and Enterococcus spp.) and Gram-negative tested strains, including Aeromonas sobria, Aeromonas caviae and the same A. hydrophila, when used as indicator. Anti-staphylococcal activity was observed with a gradual increase of the inhibition zone during incubation and seemed to be influenced by A. hydrophila hemolytic expression. Extrachromosomal analysis showed the presence, in 70% of the strains, of one to five plasmids with molecular masses ranging from 2.1 to 41.5 MDa, but it was not possible to relate this result with BLS production.
TI  - Cloning, DNA sequence, and expression of Aeromonas caviae WS7b chitinase gene.
AB  - A chitinase-producing bacterium, designated WS7b, was isolated from a soil sample obtained from a black-pepper plantation on Bangka Island, Indonesia. Fatty-acid methyl-ester analysis indicated that the isolate was Aeromonas caviae. A chitinase gene from WS7b was cloned in a pUC19-based plasmid vector, but without its natural promoter. The complete nucleotide sequence of the gene was determined, and the structural gene consisted of a 2748-bp region encoding 864 amino acids. DNA sequence analysis indicated that the gene had been cloned without its promoter, and this was confirmed by chitinase-plate assay of the truncated version of the gene in Escherichia coli. The chitinase gene product showed amino-acid sequence similarity to chiA from A. caviae. Chitinase enzyme activity was determined spectrophotometrically, using colloidal chitin azure as substrate for extracellular and intracellular fractions. The ability of the chitinase cloned in E. coli to hydrolyze chitin was less than that of the enzyme in its indigenous host.
TI  - The genetics of glycosylation in Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - In recent years there has been a dramatic increase in reports of glycosylation of proteins in various Gram-negative systems including Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Campylobacter jejuni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Caulobacter crescentus, Aeromonas caviae and Helicobacter pylori. Although this growing list contains many important pathogens (reviewed by Benz and Schmidt [Mol. Microbiol. 45 (2002) 267-276]) and the glycosylations are found on proteins important in pathogenesis such as pili, adhesins and flagella the precise role(s) of the glycosylation of these proteins remains to be determined. Furthermore, the details of the glycosylation biosynthetic process have not been determined in any of these systems. The definition of the precise role of glycosylation and the mechanism of biosynthesis will be facilitated by a detailed understanding of the genes involved.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of Aeromonas species from an eutrophic tropical estuary.
AB  - Isolation and characterization of Aeromonas species were undertaken in the Ebrie  lagoon (Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire) over a one year period. Overall 63% of 501 water samples were identified as positive for Aeromonas spp. A. sobria, A. hydrophila and A. caviae represent respectively 49.20%, 20.63% and 30.15% of the positive samples. Thirty nine of the positive samples were recovered from surface water samples; while 24 bottom water samples were positive for Aeromonas. Aeromonas species are most frequently (82.53) present in the Ebrie lagoon urban area during the rainy and flood seasons when the salinity is low and below 10 per thousand. A lower isolation frequency is noticed during the dry season when water salinity is over 10 per thousand. Finally, a higher isolation frequency occurred in samples with highest counts of Escherichia coli.
TI  - Occurrence of Staphylococcus and enteropathogens in soft cheese commercialized in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the presence of Staphylococcus aureus, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), Aeromonas spp. and Yersinia spp. in soft cheese commercialized in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 45 samples of cheese from three different brands marketed in Rio de Janeiro city were analysed for faecal coliform levels using the Most Probable Number (MPN) technique. The samples were also analysed using conventional methodology for the investigation of food-borne pathogens. High levels of faecal contamination were detected in 95.5% of cheese samples. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 20% of samples, of which 17.7% were above the limits allowed by Brazilian legislation. Aeromonas hydrophila and Aer. caviae were detected in 17.7% of the samples. Yersinia spp. were not found in this study. EPEC was isolated from 21.1% of the samples and the most frequently found serogroups were O127, followed by O55 and O26. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that 95.5% of cheese samples had high levels of faecal coliforms. The isolation of Staph. aureus, serogroups of EPEC and Aeromonas spp. suggested that the soft cheese commercialized in the city of Rio de Janeiro may represent a health risk for the consumers. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These results suggest that soft cheese may act as an important vehicle of transmission for well-established pathogens.
TI  - In vitro stepwise autoprocessing of the proform of pro-aminopeptidase processing  protease from Aeromonas caviae T-64.
AB  - PA protease (pro-aminopeptidase processing protease) is an extracellular zinc metalloprotease produced by the Gram-negative bacterium Aeromonas caviae T-64. The 590-amino-acid precursor of PA protease is composed of a putative 19-amino-acid signal sequence, a 165-amino-acid N-terminal propeptide, a 33 kDa mature protease domain and an 11 kDa C-terminal propeptide. The proform of PA protease, which was produced as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli, was subjected to in vitro refolding. It was revealed that the processing of the proform involved a stepwise autoprocessing mechanism. Firstly, the N-terminal propeptide was autocatalytically removed on completion of refolding and secondly, the C-terminal propeptide was autoprocessed after the degradation of the N-terminal propeptide. Both the N- and C-terminal propeptides existed as intact peptides after their successive removal, and they were subsequently degraded gradually. The degradation of the N-terminal propeptide appears to be the rate-limiting step in the maturation of the proform of PA protease.
TI  - Enhanced accumulation and changed monomer composition in polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) copolyester by in vitro evolution of Aeromonas caviae PHA synthase.
AB  - By in vitro evolution experiment, we have first succeeded in acquiring higher active mutants of a synthase that is a key enzyme essential for bacterial synthesis of biodegradable polyester, polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA). Aeromonas caviae FA440 synthase, termed PhaC(Ac), was chosen as a good target for evolution, since it can synthesize a PHA random copolyester of 3-hydroxybutyrate and 3-hydroxyhexanoate [P(3HB-co-3HHx)] that is a tough and flexible material compared to polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) homopolyester. The in vitro enzyme evolution system consists of PCR-mediated random mutagenesis targeted to a limited region of the phaC(Ac) gene and screening mutant enzymes with higher activities based on two types of polyester accumulation system by using Escherichia coli for the synthesis of PHB (by JM109 strain) (S. Taguchi, A. Maehara, K. Takase, M. Nakahara, H. Nakamura, and Y. Doi, FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 198:65-71, 2001) and of P(3HB-co-3HHx) [by LS5218 [fadR601 atoC(Con)] strain]. The expression vector for the phaC(Ac) gene, together with monomer-supplying enzyme genes, was designed to synthesize PHB homopolyester from glucose and P(3HB-co-3HHx) copolyester from dodecanoate. Two evolved mutant enzymes, termed E2-50 and T3-11, screened through the evolution system exhibited 56 and 21% increases in activity toward 3HB-coenzyme A, respectively, and consequently led to enhanced accumulation (up to 6.5-fold content) of P(3HB-co-3HHx) in the recombinant LS5218 strains. Two single mutations in the mutants, N149S for E2-50 and D171G for T3-11, occurred at positions that are not highly conserved among the PHA synthase family. It should be noted that increases in the 3HHx fraction (up to 16 to 18 mol%) were observed for both mutants compared to the wild type (10 mol%).
TI  - The occurrence of enteric pathogens and Aeromonas species in organic vegetables.
AB  - A range of commercially available organic vegetables (n = 86) was examined for the presence of Salmonella, Campylobacter, Escherichia coli, E. coli O 157. Listeria and Aeromonas spp., to provide information on the occurrence of such organisms in organic vegetables in Northern Ireland. The study was not designed to quantify such organisms or to compare occurrence with conventionally farmed vegetables. Standard enrichment techniques were used to isolate and identify enteric pathogens and Aeromonas species. No Salmonella, Campylobacter, E. coli. E. coli O 157, Listeria were found in any of the samples examined. Aeromonas species were isolated from 34% of the total number of organic vegetables examined. Many (64%) of the organic vegetables examined were "ready-to-eat" after minimal processing, i.e., washing. Aeromonas spp. was isolated from 41% of these vegetables. Aeromonas spp. was not recovered from certain vegetable types. The most commonly isolated species of Aeromonas was Aeromonas schubertii with 21.0% of all samples contaminated with this species; 5.8% of samples contained A. hydrophila, 5.8% A. trota, 3.5% A. caviae and 2.3% contained A. veronii biovar veronii. Although Aeromonas species are frequently detected in organic vegetables, the absence of accepted enteric pathogens was encouraging, and does not support the allegation of organic foods being of high risk due to the farming methods used.
TI  - Comparison of the antimicrobial tolerance of oxytetracycline-resistant heterotrophic bacteria isolated from hospital sewage and freshwater fishfarm water in Belgium.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between antimicrobial tolerance and taxonomic diversity among the culturable oxytetracycline-resistant (Ot(r)) heterotrophic bacterial population in two Belgian aquatic sites receiving wastewater either from human medicine or from aquaculture. The study of Ot(r) heterotrophs and mesophilic Aeromonas spp. allowed comparison of tolerance data at the intergenus as well as at the intragenus level. In total, 354 independently obtained Ot(r) isolates were subjected to antimicrobial tolerance testing and identified by GLC analysis of their cellular fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), by API 20E profiling and/or by Fluorescent Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (FAFLP) DNA fingerprinting. In general, Ot(r) hospital heterotrophs displayed a higher frequency (84%) of ampicillin (Amp) tolerance compared to the Ot(r) heterotrophs from the freshwater fishfarm site (22%). FAME results indicated that this effect was linked to the predominance of intrinsically ampicillin-resistant Ot(r) Aeromonas strains over representatives of Acinetobacter and Escherichia coli within the hospital strain set. Among the Ot(r) mesophilic Aeromonas strain set, the global tolerance profiles of the two sites only differed in a higher number of kanamycin (Kan) -tolerant strains (43%) for hospital aeromonads in comparison with the fishfarm aeromonads (8%). To some extent, this finding was correlated with the specific presence of Aeromonas caviae DNA hybridisation group (HG) 4. Collectively, these results suggest that the profiles for Amp and Kan tolerance observed in both sites arose from taxonomic differences in the culturable Ot(r) bacterial population at the generic or subgeneric level. In addition, our identification data also revealed that Enterobacter sp., Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and A. veronii biovar sobria HG8 may be considered potential indicator organisms to assess microbial tolerance in various compartments of the aquatic environment.
TI  - G561 site-directed deletion mutant chitinase from Aeromonas caviae is active without its 304 C-terminal amino acid residues.
AB  - A G561 mutant of the Aeromonas caviae chitinase ChiA was made by PCR site-directed deletion mutagenesis in order to study the role of the 304 C-terminal amino acid residues of ChiA in the enzymatic hydrolysis of chitin. The recombinant ChiAG561 encoded on a 1.6-kb DNA fragment of A. caviae chiA was expressed in a heterologous Escherichia coli host using the pET20b(+) expression system. The His-Tag-affinity-purified recombinant ChiAG561 had a calculated molecular mass of 63,595 Da, which was consistent with the 67,000 Da estimated by SDS-PAGE. The G561 deletion mutant enzyme had the same optimum pH (6.5) as the full-length ChiA and a lower optimum temperature (37 degrees C instead of 42.5 degrees C). Biochemical properties of the recombinant ChiAG561 suggested that deletion of the 304 C-terminal amino acid residues of ChiA did not significantly affect ChiA enzyme activity. However, compared to the full-length ChiA, the mutant chitinase had a ten-fold higher relative activity with 4-methylumbelliferyl-N-N'-N"-triacetylchitotriose [4-MU-(GlcNAc)3] as a substrate, and higher rates of hydrolysis with both chitin and colloidal chitin substrates. Results obtained from this study suggest that the active region of A. caviae ChiA is located in the region before G561 of the protein molecule.
TI  - Cloning, expression, and characterization of a family 52 beta-xylosidase gene (xysB) of a multiple-xylanase-producing bacterium, Aeromonas caviae ME-1.
AB  - A lambda phage genomic library of Aeromonas caviae ME-1, a multiple-xylanase-producing bacterium, was screened for xylan degradation activities. We isolated one clone, B65, which had weak xylanase activity, by the DNS method, but gave no visible bands on zymogram assay using SDS-xylan-PAGE. Based on TLC analyses of enzymatic products and some glycosidase assays using p-nitrophenyl substrates, we established that pB65 encodes a beta-xylosidase gene. In the nucleotide sequence analysis, we found a 2190-bp open reading frame (ORF) named xysB. XysB protein is similar to some beta-xylosidases, which are categorized in the glycosyl hydrolase family 52. Another ORF (xyg), that showed similarity to the family 67 alpha-glucuronidase, was also found downstream of the xysB gene. The xysB ORF and its promoter region were cloned into the pT7-Blue vector and the transformant cells had beta-xylosidase activity. The relative molecular mass were estimated to be 75 kDa by SDS-PAGE and 159 kDa by gel filtration. These data showed that XysB has a dimeric structure of 80,697 Da subunits. This enzyme showed optimal activity at 50 degrees C and pH 6.0. It was stable below 40 degrees C and pH 5-8. The Km and Vmax were calculated to be 0.34 mM and 33 nmol x min(-1) x microg(-1), respectively. This enzyme also showed transglycosylation activity against X3 and produced X4 and X5.
TI  - Distribution of oxytetracycline resistance plasmids between aeromonads in hospital and aquaculture environments: implication of Tn1721 in dissemination of the tetracycline resistance determinant tet A.
AB  - Oxytetracycline-resistant (OT(r)) mesophilic aeromonads were recovered from untreated hospital effluent (72 isolates) and from fish farm hatchery tanks (91 isolates) at sites within the English Lake District, Cumbria, England. The transfer of OT(r) plasmids from these isolates was investigated. Using Escherichia coli J53-1 as a recipient, 11 isolates from the hospital site and 6 isolates from the fish farm site transferred OT(r) plasmids (designated pFBAOT1 to 17). Original isolates were identified using fatty acid methyl ester and fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism comparisons as either Aeromonas hydrophila HG3 (eight isolates), A. veronii b.v. sobria HG8 (six isolates), and A. caviae HGB5 (one isolate). One isolate remained unidentified, and one could not be assigned a taxonomic designation beyond the genus level. Plasmids pFBAOT1 to -17 were screened for the presence of the tetracycline resistance determinants Tet A to E and Tet G. Only determinant Tet A (10 plasmids) was detected in these plasmids, with 7 tet gene determinants remaining unclassified. In all cases, Tet A was located on a 5.5-kb EcoRI restriction fragment. Hybridization with inc-rep probes N, P, Q, W, and U showed pFBAOT3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -9, and -11, from the hospital environment, to be IncU plasmids. Further, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses and DNA probing demonstrated that pFBAOT plasmids were closely related to IncU OT(r) plasmids pASOT, pASOT2, pASOT3, pRAS1 (originally isolated from A. salmonicida strains from fish farms in Scotland and Norway, respectively), and pIE420 (isolated from a German hospital E. coli strain). In addition, DNA analyses demonstrated that plasmids pRAS1 and pIE420 had identical RFLP profiles and that all fragments hybridized to each other. The presence of tetracycline resistance transposon Tn1721 in its entirety or in a truncated form in these plasmids was demonstrated. These results provided direct evidence that related tetracycline resistance-encoding plasmids have disseminated between different Aeromonas species and E. coli and between the human and aquaculture environments in distinct geographical locations. Collectively, these findings provide evidence to support the hypothesis that the aquaculture and human compartments of the environment behave as a single interactive compartment.
TI  - Some emerging food and water borne pathogens.
AB  - Emerging pathogens are those infective organisms whose incidence has recently increased or is likely to increase during the next two decades due to changes in demography, food habits, food technology, commerce, water sources and environmental factors. Some important emerging food and water borne bacterial pathogens include Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella enteritidis, Escherichia coli O157: H7, Vibrio cholerae biotype E1 Tor Serotype 0139, Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Aeromonas hydrophila, A. sobria, and A. caviae. The prevalence, ecological relationships of these organisms, their transmission through food, water and other environmental sources, and role of their virulent factors in the pathogenesis of infections and their public health significance is discussed in this paper with special reference to the situation in India.
TI  - Site-directed mutagenesis of Asp313, Glu315, and Asp391 residues in chitinase of  Aeromonas caviae.
AB  - Site-directed mutagenesis was used to explore the roles of amino acid residues involved in the activity of chitinase from Aeromonas caviae. Kinetic parameters for 4-methylumbelliferyl-N,N'-diacetyl-chitobiose or 4-methylumbelliferyl-N,N',N"-triacetylchitotriose hydrolysis were determined with wild-type and mutant chitinases. Chitinases with the mutations E315D (or Q) and D391E (or N) were severely impaired and had dramatically decreased kcat. However, the effect of the these mutations on the Km values were different. The function of the carboxyl group of Asp313 was partially replaced by the amide of Asn when the 4-methylumbelliferyl-N,N',N"-triacetylchitotriose substrate was used. Results indicated that Asp313, Glu315, and Asp391 might be the best candidates for the catalytic residues of chitinase A from Aeromonas caviae.
TI  - Molecular cloning of two (R)-specific enoyl-CoA hydratase genes from Pseudomonas  aeruginosa and their use for polyhydroxyalkanoate synthesis.
AB  - Two Pseudomonas aeruginosa genes, termed phaJ1(Pa) and phaJ2(Pa), homologous to the Aeromonas caviae (R)-specific enoyl-CoA hydratase gene (phaJ(Ac)) were cloned using a PCR technique to investigate the monomer-supplying ability for polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthesis from beta-oxidation cycle. Two expression plasmids for phaJ1(Pa) and phaJ2(Pa) were constructed and introduced into Escherichia coli DH5alpha strain. The recombinants harboring phaJ1(Pa) or phaJ2(Pa) showed high (R)-specific enoyl-CoA hydratase activity with different substrate specificities, that is, specific for short chain-length enoyl-CoA or medium chain-length enoyl-CoA, respectively. In addition, co-expression of these two hydratase genes with PHA synthase gene in E. coli LS5218 resulted in the accumulation of PHA up to 14-29 wt% of cell dry weight from dodecanoate as a sole carbon source. It has been suggested that phaJ1(Pa) and phaJ2(Pa) products have the monomer-supplying ability for PHA synthesis from beta-oxidation cycle.
TI  - Molecular cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of the extracellular endoprotease of Aeromonas caviae T-64, a pro-aminopeptidase processing enzyme(1).
AB  - PA protease (pro-aminopeptidase processing protease) activates the pro-aminopeptidases from Aeromonas caviae T-64 and Vibrio proteolytica by removal of their pro-regions. Cloning and sequencing of the PA protease gene revealed that PA protease was translated as a preproprotein consisting of four domains: a signal peptide; an N-terminal propeptide; a mature region; and a C-terminal propeptide. The deduced amino acid sequence of the PA protease precursor showed significant homology with several bacterial metalloproteases. Expression of the PA protease gene in Escherichia coli indicated that the N-terminal propeptide of the PA protease precursor is essential to obtain the active form of the protease. The N- and C-terminal propeptides of the expressed pro-PA protease were processed autocatalytically.
TI  - Co-expression of 3-ketoacyl-ACP reductase and polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase genes induces PHA production in Escherichia coli HB101 strain.
AB  - The Escherichia coli 3-ketoacyl-ACP reductase gene (fabGEc) was cloned using a PCR technique to investigate the metabolic link between fatty acid metabolism and polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) production. Three plasmids respectively harboring fabGEc and the poly-3-hydroxyalkanoate synthesis genes phaCAc and phaC1Ps from Aeromonas caviae and Pseudomonas sp. 61-3 respectively were constructed and introduced into E. coli HB101 strain. On a two-stage cultivation using dodecanoate as the sole carbon source, recombinant E. coli HB101 strains harboring fabGEc and phaC genes accumulated PHA copolymers (about 8 wt% of dry cell weight) consisting of several (R)-3-hydroxyalkanoate units of C4, C6, C8, and C10. It has been suggested that overexpression of the fabGEc gene leads to the supply of (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA for PHA synthesis via fatty acid degradation.
TI  - Intramolecular chaperone and inhibitor activities of a propeptide from a bacterial zinc aminopeptidase.
AB  - An aminopeptidase from Aeromonas caviae T-64 was translated as a preproprotein consisting of three domains; a signal peptide (19 amino acid residues), an N-terminal propeptide (101 residues) and a mature region (273 residues). We demonstrated that a proteinase, which was isolated from the culture filtrate of A. caviae T-64, activated the recombinant pro-aminopeptidase by removal of the majority of the propeptide. Using L-Leu-p-nitroanilide as a substrate, the processed aminopeptidase showed a large increase in kcat when compared with the unprocessed enzyme, whereas the Km value remained relatively unchanged. The similar Km values for the pro-aminopeptidase and the mature aminopeptidase indicated that the N-terminal propeptide of the pro-aminopeptidase did not influence the formation of the enzyme-substrate complex, suggesting the absence of marked conformational changes in the active domain. In contrast, the marked difference in kcat suggests a significant decrease in the energy of one or more of the transition states of the enzyme-substrate reaction coordinate. Moreover, we showed that the activity of the urea-denatured pro-aminopeptidase could be recovered by dialysis, whereas the activity of the urea-denatured mature aminopeptidase, which lacked the propeptide, could not. Further to this, the propeptide-deleted aminopeptidase formed an inclusion body in the cytoplasmic space in Escherichia coli and was not secreted at all. These results suggested that the propeptide of the pro-aminopeptidase acted as an intramolecular chaperone that was involved with the correct folding of the enzyme in vitro and was required for extracellular secretion in E. coli.
TI  - Distribution of two hemolytic toxin genes in clinical and environmental isolates  of Aeromonas spp.: correlation with virulence in a suckling mouse model.
AB  - Previous studies have shown that two hemolytic toxins, HlyA and AerA, contribute  to the virulence of Aeromonas hydrophila. A survey was performed to gauge the distribution of hlyA and aerA genes in clinical and environmental Aeromonas isolates. For A. hydrophila, A. veronii biotype sobria and A caviae, 96%, 12% and 35% of strains, respectively, were hlyA positive, whereas, 78%, 97%, 41%, respectively, were aerA positive. All virulent A. hydrophila isolates were hlyA+ aerA+. This genotype was most common in A. hydrophila (75.4%) followed by A. caviae (29.4%) and A. veronii biotype sobria (9.6%). For A. hydrophila, a two-hemolytic toxin model of virulence provides the best prediction of virulence in an animal model.
TI  - Co-expression of polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase and (R)-enoyl-CoA hydratase genes  of Aeromonas caviae establishes copolyester biosynthesis pathway in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Polyhydroxyalkanoate biosynthesis genes of Aeromonas caviae were expressed in Escherichia coli LS5218 (fadR atoC(Con)), and the polyhydroxyalkanoate-producing ability of the recombinants was investigated. A LS5218 strain harboring only phaCAc (polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase gene) did not accumulate any polyhydroxyalkanoate from dodecanoate in spite of the existence of translated polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase protein, whereas co-expression phaCAc and phaJAc ((R)-specific enoyl-CoA hydratase gene) resulted in the accumulation of P(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) copolymer up to 7-11 wt% of dry cell weight from octanoate and dodecanoate. These results indicated that both phaCAc and phaJAc are essential for E. coli LS5218 to establish the polyhydroxyalkanoate biosynthesis pathway from alkanoic acids. The copolyester content in the strain expressing both the genes under the lac promoter control reached to 38 wt% from dodecanoate. Enzyme assays suggest that efficient monomer formation via beta-oxidation by a high level expression of phaJAc was important to achieve a high polyhydroxyalkanoate content in the recombinant E. coli.
TI  - Molecular properties and activity of a carboxyl-terminal truncated form of xylanase 3 from Aeromonas caviae W-61.
AB  - Aeromonas caviae W-61 produces five species of xylanases, xylanases 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 [Nguyen, V.D. et al., Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem., 56, 1708-1712 (1993) and Appl. Environ. Microbiol., 57, 445-449 (1991)]. While preserving a purified xylanase 3 preparation from A. caviae in solution at 4 degrees C, the xylanase 3 was found to be proteolyzed to give a truncated form with a smaller molecular mass than that of the intact one. It appears likely that the truncated form of xylanase 3 was produced in this particular purification experiment by the action of a contaminating protease. We isolated the truncated form of xylanase 3 (Xyn3tr), of which the C-terminal 102-residue segment is missing. By the chemical analysis of the N- and C-terminal amino acid residues of Xyn3tr and the DNA sequencing analysis of the xylanase 3 gene (xyn3), the N-terminal 398th proline residue of xylanase 3 was found to be the C-terminus of Xyn3tr. Xyn3tr had the activity to form xylotriose (X3), xylotetraose (X4), xylopentaose (X5), and xylohexaose (X6) as main final products from oat spelt xylan. In contrast, intact xylanase 3 released X6 and higher xylo-oligosaccharides as main products. Xylanase 3 hydrolysed X4 through X6. However, Xyn3tr had no activity towards X4 and X5. The recombinant Xyn3tr and recombinant xylanase 3 (XYN3) were purified homogeneously from the periplasmic space of E. coli harboring the plasmids pXYN3 and pXYN3tr, which include xyn3 and xyn3tr genes, respectively, and their enzymatic activities were measured. The cleavage patterns of oat spelt and xylo-oligosaccharides by XYN3tr were identical with that by intact Xyn3tr. Thus, we conclude that the C-terminal region comprising a 102-residue segment in xylanase 3 is involved in governing the molecular size of xylo-oligosaccharides cleaved from beta-1,4-xylan by the enzyme and in the hydrolytic activity towards X4 and X5.
TI  - Bactericidal effect of chlorine on motile Aeromonas spp. in drinking water supplies and influence of temperature on disinfection efficacy.
AB  - The susceptibility of toxigenic Aeromonas spp. to free chlorine in drinking water supplies, and the influence of environmental temperature on the bactericidal activity of the oxidant, were evaluated. The results showed inactivation curves characterized by an initial phase of rapid reduction of viable cells followed by a slow inactivation of bacteria. The effect of the chlorine compound was markedly influenced by water temperature. At a summer water temperature (20 degrees C), the efficacy of the chlorine concentrations tested was found to be two to three times lower compared to that found at a winter temperature (5 degrees C). Resistance was moderately, but significantly, greater in Aer. hydrophila vs Aer. caviae and Aer. sobria, but all Aeromonas spp. were more susceptible than Escherichia coli. Selective pressure with free chlorine did not produce Aeromonas cells with higher levels of chlorine resistance.
TI  - Expression and characterization of (R)-specific enoyl coenzyme A hydratase involved in polyhydroxyalkanoate biosynthesis by Aeromonas caviae.
AB  - Complementation analysis of a polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA)-negative mutant of Aeromonas caviae proved that ORF3 in the pha locus (a 402-bp gene located downstream of the PHA synthase gene) participates in PHA biosynthesis on alkanoic acids, and the ORF3 gene is here referred to as phaJ(Ac). Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) carrying phaJ(Ac). under the control of the T7 promoter overexpressed enoyl coenzyme A (enoyl-CoA) hydratase, which was purified by one-step anion-exchange chromatography. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified hydratase corresponded to the amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of phaJ(Ac) except for the initial Met residue. The enoyl-CoA hydratase encoded by phaJ(Ac) exhibited (R)-specific hydration activity toward trans-2-enoyl-CoA with four to six carbon atoms. These results have demonstrated that (R)-specific hydration of 2-enoyl-CoA catalyzed by the translated product of phaJ(Ac) is a channeling pathway for supplying (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA monomer units from fatty acid beta-oxidation to poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) biosynthesis in A. caviae.
TI  - Expression and characterization of the recombinant gene encoding chitinase from Aeromonas caviae.
AB  - The gene encoding a chitinase from Aeromonas caviae was cloned by PCR techniques. Its recombinant gene expression was performed using pET20b(+) in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The recombinant chitinase with the extra 33 and 13 amino acids in its N- and C-termini, respectively, was purified to near homogeneity using His-Tag affinity chromatography. The recombinant chitinase was found to be present in both the culture medium and the cytoplasm. A single protein band on the native polyacrylamide gel was confirmed by both the activity staining and protein staining. The optimum pH and temperature of the recombinant chitinase were determined to be 6.25-6.5 and 42.5 degrees C, respectively. It was stable within the pH range of 5-7. Significant activity stimulation by Cu2+ and inhibition by Fe3+ and Hg2+ were observed. Detergents such as SDS and Triton X-100 strongly inhibited the enzyme activity. Substrates such as 4-methylumbelliferyl-N,N'-diacetylchitobioside and 4-methylumbelliferyl-N,N',N"-triacetylchitotriose were hydrolyzed by the recombinant chitinase; however, 4-methylumbelliferyl-N-acetylglucosaminide was not cleaved during the activity assay periods. When chitin power was suspended in buffer with the chitinase (pH 6.5 and 42.5 degrees C), N-acetylchitooligosaccharides [(GlcNAc)n, n = 1-4] were detected at 24 h.
TI  - Enteropathogenic bacteria in the La Paz River of Bolivia.
AB  - Diarrheal diseases often result from ingestion of contaminated water or food. The population of La Paz, Bolivia is directly or indirectly exposed to the sewage-contaminated La Paz River. We conducted a bacteriologic survey of the La Paz River to quantify the level of bacterial contamination, with particular reference to enteropathogens. A total bacterial count exceeding 10(6) colony-forming units (CFU)/ml, including lactose fermenting and nonfermenting, gram-negative bacilli of approximately 10(5) CFU/ml, respectively, were detected in river water samples collected near two densely populated areas. A total bacterial count of 10(5) CFU/ml was also detected at the most downstream area of the river near a sparsely populated area. At four sampling locations, several enteropathogens were detected, including five enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) (serotype O6, O15, and O159), two enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) (serotype O44), two enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) (serotype O29), and three Salmonella O4 group isolates. The heat-labile enterotoxin gene and the invasive toxin gene were detected in all ETEC and EIEC isolates by polymerase chain reaction analysis. Nine isolates of E. coli were found by the agar dilution method to be susceptible to ampicillin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol, and ampicillin resistance was found in only two isolates of EIEC 7-4 (serotype O29) and EPEC 7-5 (serotype O44). Ampicillin resistance was coded on plasmids and transferred conjugatively to E. coli chi1037 at a frequency of 10(-5) CFU/donor by the broth mating method. Strains of Aeromonas caviae, which can cause diarrheal disease in infants, were detected in vegetables grown in fields irrigated by water from the La Paz River. The survival of nine isolates of E. coli in filtered river water was compared with that of laboratory strains (E. coli chi1037, W3110, and ATCC29577). The survival time of seven isolates, excluding two ampicillin-resistant isolates, was markedly longer than that of the laboratory strains. Our results show a high bacterial contamination of the La Paz river and suggest that such levels may contribute to the high incidence of diarrheal disease in the city of La Paz.
TI  - Cloning and analysis of the poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) biosynthesis genes of Aeromonas caviae.
AB  - A 5.0-kbp EcoRV-EcoRI restriction fragment was cloned and analyzed from genomic DNA of Aeromonas caviae, a bacterium producing a copolyester of (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) and (R)-3-hydroxyhexanoate (3HHx) [P(3HB-co-3HHx)] from alkanoic acids or oils. The nucleotide sequence of this region showed a 1,782-bp poly (3-hydroxyalkanoate) (PHA) synthase gene (phaC(Ac) [i.e., the phaC gene from A. caviae]) together with four open reading frames (ORF1, -3, -4, and -5) and one putative promoter region. The cloned fragments could not only complement PHA-negative mutants of Alcaligenes eutrophus and Pseudomonas putida, but also confer the ability to synthesize P(3HB-co-3HHx) from octanoate or hexanoate on the mutants' hosts. Furthermore, coexpression of ORF1 and ORF3 genes with phaC(Ac) in the A. eutrophus mutant resulted in a decrease in the polyester content of the cells. Escherichia coli expressing ORF3 showed (R)-enoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) hydratase activity, suggesting that (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA monomer units are supplied via the (R)-specific hydration of enoyl-CoA in A. caviae. The transconjugant of the A. eutrophus mutant expressing only phaC(Ac) effectively accumulated P(3HB-co-3HHx) up to 96 wt% of the cellular dry weight from octanoate in one-step cultivation.
TI  - Expression of Aeromonas caviae bla genes in Escherichia coli.
AB  - An isolate of Aeromonas caviae 035 carried a 55.5 kb self-transferable plasmid. Transfer of the plasmid to Escherichia coli K12 resulted in the expression of a TEM-like beta-lactamase that was not expressed in parental A. caviae. The bla gene sequence was detectable by DNA hybridization and PCR amplification of the plasmid when extracted from parental A. caviae or from E. coli K12 transconjugants. Sequence analysis of the bla genes revealed in each case an 858 bp open reading frame, differing from the TEM-1 sequence by five nucleotide substitutions. Only one of these resulted in amino acid substitution (at position 162 serine-->arginine). The sequence most closely resembles that of TEM-12.
TI  - Diarrheal and environmental isolates of Aeromonas spp. produce a toxin similar to Shiga-like toxin 1.
AB  - Diarrheal and environmental isolates of 39 strains of Aeromonas spp. were studied for detection of virulence factors. Although these 39 strains did not produce either heat-labile or heat-stable enterotoxins, culture filtrates of 31 strains produced cytopathic effects on Vero cells. Among these, culture filtrates of three strains of Aeromonas hydrophila and one strain of Aeromonas caviae could be neutralized by Escherichia coli O157:H7 Shiga-like toxin 1 antiserum. A single band of plasmid DNA of 2.14 kbp was isolated from these strains of Aeromonas spp. and E. coli O157:H7, which could be amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), employing oligonucleotide primers from the Shiga-like toxin 1 (SLT1) gene of E. coli O157:H7. E. coli HB 101 cells when transformed with the same plasmid showed cytopathic effects on Vero cells, which indicates that the SLT 1 homolog gene(s) of Aeromonas spp. is plasmid encoded. These results suggest that Aeromonas spp. may also produce Shiga-like toxin 1, or at least a cytotoxin with some homology with the Shiga-like toxin 1 of E. coli O157:H7.
TI  - Cloning and primary structure of the chiA gene from Aeromonas caviae.
AB  - The chiA gene from Aeromonas caviae encodes an extracellular chitinase, 865 amino acids long, that shows a high degree of similarity to chitinase A of Serratia marcescens. Expression in Escherichia coli yielded an enzymatically active protein from which a leader sequence was removed, presumably during transport of the enzyme across the cell membrane.
TI  - Aeromonads in acute diarrhoea and asymptomatic infections in Nigerian children.
AB  - Stool samples of 616 asymptomatic and 296 diarrhoeic school children were compared for the recovery rate of Aeromonas spp. on ampicillin (10 micrograms/ml) sheep blood agar. Culture filtrates of isolates were tested for haemolysin production with 1% freshly washed rabbit erythrocytes. Stools of 9 (3.0%) diarrhoeic children yielded five strains of A. hydrophila and four of A. veronii (two each of biotypes sobria and veronii), compared to 12 (1.9%) (p > 0.01) asymptomatic children who harbored seven A. hydrophila and five A. caviae strains. Isolates from-diarrhoeic stools were exclusively from children < or = 5 years, while all infected asymptomatic children were > or = 6 years. Culture filtrates of all nine diarrhoeic strains were uniformly enterotoxigenic (intestinal weight ratio > 0.083) and produced haemolysin titres > 128. These phenotypes where variable in carriage strains of A. hydrophila but were not detected in A. caviae. The recovery of A. hydrophila, and A. veronii biotypes from diarrhoeic stools of children < or = 5 years may suggest their involvement in diarrhoea causation in the absence of other diarrhoeagenic agents.
TI  - Aeromonas species exhibit aggregative adherence to HEp-2 cells.
AB  - Clinical and environmental isolates of Aeromonas species (five A. hydrophila isolates, three A. caviae isolates, and two A. sobria isolates) were tested for their adherence to HEp-2 cells. Clinical isolates of A. hydrophila and A. sobria exhibited aggregative adherence similar to that presented by enteroadherent-aggregative Escherichia coli. Bacterial aggregates adhered to cells with a typical "stacked-brick" appearance. In contrast, A. caviae strains showed a diffuse adherence pattern.
TI  - Enterotoxigenicity, hemolytic activity and antibiotic resistance of Aeromonas spp. isolated from freshwater prawn marketed in Dhaka, Bangladesh.
AB  - Aeromonas spp. were isolated from gills, swimmerets, eggs, stomachs and ventral muscles of freshwater prawns (Macrobrachium malcolmsonii) available in the local fish market of Dhaka, Bangladesh. The density of Aeromonas spp. on these different body parts of the prawn samples ranged from 1.1 +/- 0.2 x 10(4) to 1.5 +/- 0.16 x 10(7) cfu per gram. The viable counts of aeromonads, fecal coliforms (FC) and Escherichia coli gradually increased in prawn samples when stored at 4 C. At -20 C, the viable counts gradually decreased and became zero on the 12th day of storage. The isolation of A. sobria (56%) was more frequent than that of A. hydrophila (31%) and A. caviae (13%). In the rabbit ileal loop (RIL) model, fluid accumulation induced by live cultures and cell-free culture filtrates of 11 strains ranged from 0.5 to 1.5 and 0.5 to 1.7 ml/cm of gut, respectively. Of 11 enterotoxigenic strains, 7 were A. sobria and 4 were A. hydrophila. Enterotoxigenicity correlated with hemolytic activity on blood agar. All enterotoxigenic strains were uniformly sensitive to chloramphenicol and gentamicin and resistant to novobiocin and vancomycin. Isolation of enterotoxigenic and antibiotic-resistant Aeromonas from these prawn samples indicates possible public health problems for their handlers as well for raw prawn consumers.
TI  - Aeromonas-associated diarrhoea in north India.
AB  - The incidence of Aeromonas-associated diarrhoea in patients attending the hospital attached to the Dayanand Medical College, Ludhiana, India was investigated during May 1984-May 1987. Microbiological examination of single faecal samples from 2,661 patients showed the presence of various enteropathogens of which details of only Aeromonas isolations are given and discussed in the present article. A small control sample of 105 age-matched healthy volunteers were also examined. Only 55 patients (2.1% of all patients) showed Aeromonas spp. in their stool samples on culture. Aeromonas as a single pathogen was isolated from 37 patients and, from 18 patients it was mixed with other enteropathogens. Stools of healthy controls did not contain any pathogen. Seven of 25 isolates of A. caviae, all 18 isolates of A. sobria and all 7 isolates of A. hydrophilla were shown to be enterotoxigenic by rabbit ileal loop test. There was no immunological cross-reaction between Aeromonas enterotoxin and Escherichia coli labile toxin antiserum. The Aeromonas isolates were susceptible to most of the commonly used antimicrobial agents except ampicillin and cephalothin.
TI  - Detection of the aerolysin gene in Aeromonas hydrophila by the polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - Synthetic oligonucleotide primers were used in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)  technique to detect the gene for aerolysin in strains of Aeromonas hydrophila and to screen for identical genes in A. caviae, A. sobria, and A. veronii isolated from patients with diarrheal disease. Primers targeted a 209-bp fragment of the aer gene coding for the beta-hemolysin and detected template DNA only in the PCR using nucleic acid (NA) from hemolytic strains of A. hydrophila which were also cytotoxic to Vero and CHO cells and enterotoxic in suckling-mouse assays. PCR amplification of NA from hemolytic A. sobria or nonhemolytic A. hydrophila and A. caviae strains was consistently negative. Primer specificity was determined in the PCR by using NA extracted from 56 strains of bacteria, including hemolytic Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes as well as several recognized enteric pathogens defined in terms of their toxigenicity. The detection limit for the aerolysin gene by PCR amplification was 1 ng of total NA. The PCR clearly identified aerolysin-producing strains of A. hydrophila and may have application as a species-specific virulence test because other hemolytic Aeromonas species tested were negative.
TI  - [Sensitivity of enteropathogenic bacteria to furazolidone].
AB  - The sensitivity in vitro of 348 strains of 18 enteropathogen agents to furazolidone was investigated during the period of 1987-1989. All strains of Shigella sonnei (17), S. flexneri (17), S. boydii (16), Escherichia coli enteropathogen (40), E. coli enteroinvasive (20), Campylobacter jejuni (50), Vibrio cholerae 01 (5), Vibrio cholerae non 01 (5), V. parahaemolyticus (5), V. alginolyticus (2), Aeromonas hydrophila (5), A. caviae (5), A. sobria (5), and Plesiomonas shigelloides (12) were sensitive (MIC < or = 8 mg/l), except a strains of E. coli enteropathogen (MIC 16 mg/l). The 15.5% of the 51 strains of Salmonella enterica belonging to the type I isolated between 1987 and 1989 were resistant (MIC > or = 16 mg/l). A similar degree of resistance was observed in 20 strains of this agent isolated between 1978 and 1980. The 30 strains of Yersinia (including 15 strains of Y. enterocolitica 03) presented extreme values of MICs of 8 and 16 mg/l.
TI  - Effects of incorporating ampicillin, bile salts and carbohydrates in media on the recognition and selection of Aeromonas spp. from faeces.
AB  - The effects of incorporating ampicillin, some bile salts and sugars into media on the primary recognition and selection of aeromonads from faeces were examined. Most (88%) of the 101 Aeromonas strains examined had an ampicillin MIC of greater than or equal to 40 mg/L, and would be isolated on blood agar containing ampicillin 30 mg/L. The strains with an ampicillin MIC of less than 40 mg/L were all of human origin and predominantly A. caviae. Although ampicillin at 10, 20 or 30 mg/L in blood agar inhibited faecal bacteria, the ability to detect Aeromonas strains with a high ampicillin MIC was less when the lower concentrations of ampicillin were used, without any improvement in the isolation of those strains with a low ampicillin MIC. Thirty-seven strains were tested for sensitivity to several different bile salts and found to be at least as resistant to them as Escherichia coli NCTC 10418. Bile salt sensitivity was not related to the species or source of a strain. There were minor differences in sensitivity to bile salts between some strains which related to whether strains had been isolated originally in the presence of bile salt or not. The effects of the presence of E. coli, Klebsiella spp. and Enterococcus faecalis on the growth of Aeromonas strains in mixed culture on media with and without carbohydrate were examined. The colony size of some Aeromonas strains was reduced in mixed culture but colony counts were not affected with any Aeromonas strains.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Typing of Aeromonas strains by DNA restriction endonuclease analysis and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of cell envelopes.
AB  - The outer membrane protein (OMP) composition (OMP typing) of 46 fecal Aeromonas strains from hybridization groups (HGs) 1 (A. hydrophila; n = 10), 4 (A. caviae; n = 16), and 8 (A. veronii; n = 20) were examined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a phenotypic typing method. Almost every isolate of HG-1 and HG-8 had a unique OMP profile, in contrast to isolates of HG-4, which were separated into five different OMP types. It was possible to recognize HGs 1, 4, and 8 by OMP profiles. Twenty-three Aeromonas strains from HGs 1 (n = 5), 4 (n = 10), and 8 (n = 8) were tested by whole-cell DNA restriction endonuclease analysis (REA) as a genetic typing method. All strains tested by REA (with SmaI) had different DNA digestion patterns. Although additional DNA-rRNA hybridization analyses with SmaI and 16S and 23S rRNAs from Escherichia coli showed a reduction in the number of restriction bands to 8 to 13 hybridized fragments, the discriminative value was less when compared with that obtained by REA. The individual differences found by REA were used to analyze whether patients remained colonized by the same Aeromonas strain. Of 11 patients with diarrhea, 2 had a different isolate on repeat culture. In addition, one of nine tested fecal samples contained two Aeromonas isolates with different REA patterns. These results indicate that during diarrheal disease the intestinal tract may be colonized simultaneously with different Aeromonas isolates.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of the Aeromonas caviae recA gene and construction of an A. caviae recA mutant.
AB  - A recombinant plasmid carrying the recA gene of Aeromonas caviae was isolated from an A. caviae genomic library by complementation of an Escherichia coli recA mutant. The plasmid restored resistance to both UV irradiation and to the DNA-damaging agent methyl methanesulfonate in the E. coli recA mutant strain. The cloned gene also restored recombination proficiency as measured by the formation of lac+ recombinants from duplicated mutant lacZ genes and by the ability to propagate a strain of phage lambda (red gam) that requires host recombination functions for growth. The approximate location of the recA gene on the cloned DNA fragment was determined by constructing deletions and by the insertion of Tn5, both of which abolished the ability of the recombinant plasmid to complement the E. coli recA strains. A. caviae recA::Tn5 was introduced into A. caviae by P1 transduction. The resulting A. caviae recA mutant strain was considerably more sensitive to UV light than was its parent. Southern hybridization analysis indicated that the A. caviae recA gene has diverged from the recA genes from a variety of gram-negative bacteria, including A. hydrophila and A. sobria. Maxicell labeling experiments revealed that the RecA protein of A. caviae had an Mr of about 39,400.
TI  - Clinical associations of Aeromonas spp. in fecal specimens from children.
AB  - Human infections caused by Aeromonas spp. are being reported with increased frequency. We examined 1012 unselected stool specimens from 799 children for various pathogens, including Aeromonas spp., to evaluate the clinical associations of Aeromonas spp. in the stools of children in the East End of London. A total of 33 children had positive cultures for Aeromonas spp. These were identified as: Aeromonas hydrophila (16), A. sobria (9), A. caviae (8). Aeromonas spp. were identified by being oxidase positive in character, a property that distinguishes Aeromonas spp. from Enterobacteriaceae. Associated pathogens included Salmonella typhimurium (1), Campylobacter spp. (3), Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (2), and Giardia lamblia (1). Electron microscopic examination of the stool of 13 children revealed viral particles in two, rotavirus (1), and coronavirus-like particles (1). The associated clinical features in the 25 children with only Aeromonas excretion were diarrhea (21), vomiting (10), abdominal pain (9), fever (4), and mild dehydration (2). Five patients had macroscopic blood loss in the stools. The illness was generally mild and lasted only a short time.
TI  - Enterotoxigenicity of aeromonas strains in suckling mice.
AB  - The enterotoxigenicity of 170 Aeromonas strains isolated from different sources (food poisoning, random food sampling, water, faeces) was examined by the suckling mouse test. The strains were grown on Syncaye culture medium covered with sterilized membrane for Kiil-kidney. The culture supernatants were inoculated orally. Ileal loop dilatation was compared to that produced by the international standard enterotoxic Escherichia coli B7A (O148 : H28) and B2C (O6 : H16) strains. Of the 87 Aeromonas hydrophila strains 69, of the 76 Aeromonas punctate subsp. caviae strains 9, the 6 Aeromonas punctata subsp. punctata strains 5, and 1 Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. achromogenes gave a positive reaction in the test.
TI  - [Aeromonas punctata subsp. caviae as the causative agent of acute gastroenteritis (author's transl)].
AB  - Since in the past, Aeromonas hydrophila had been isolated from all cases of human infection described. A. punctata and the anaerogenic sub-species were considered as apathogenic. From the case described, a close association between acute diarrhea with vomiting and the identification of A. punctata subsp. caviae becomes evident so that a conditional pathogenicity of this sub-species must be assumed. The question is discussed whether a preceding disturbance of the intestinal habitat in the presence of a particular susceptibility of the gastrointestinal tract promoted gastro-enteritis. Infection may have been brought about by the ingestion of surface water contaminated by sewage. Attention is again drawn to the fact that in the case of enteritis occuring during the open-air bathing season, faeces samples should also be examined for their Aeromonas content which may be performed by a simple indophenol or so-called cytochrome oxidase reaction of the aerobic flora in feces by rubbing off colonies into a corresponding test strip.
