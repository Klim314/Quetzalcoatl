TI  == effect of estradiol on planktonic growth, coaggregation, and biofilm formation of the prevotella intermedia group bacteria.
AB  == alterations in the quantity and quality of biofilms at gingival margin are considered to play a role in the initiation and development of pregnancy-related  gingivitis. prevotella intermedia sensu lato is able to consume estradiol, the major sex hormone secreted during pregnancy, in the absence of vitamin k. the aim of the study was to examine the effect of estradiol on the planktonic growth, coaggregation, polysaccharide production, and biofilm formation of the p. intermedia group bacteria, namely p. intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and prevotella pallens. in all experiments, the type strain (atcc) and a clinical strain (ahn) of p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, and p. pallens were incubated with  the concentrations of 0, 30, 90, and 120 nmol/l of estradiol. planktonic growth was assessed by means of the colony forming unit method, while coaggregation and  biofilm formation were assessed by spectrophotometric methods. in the determination of protein and polysaccharide levels, the bradford and phenol-sulfuric acid methods were used, respectively. p. pallens ahn 9283 and p.  nigrescens atcc 33563 increased their numbers at planktonic stage with increasing estradiol concentrations. in 48-h biofilm tests, elevated protein levels were found for both strains of p. intermedia, and the strains p. nigrescens atcc 33563 and p. pallens ahn 9283 in the presence of estradiol. the p. intermedia strains also increased the levels of polysaccharide formation in the biofilm. coaggregation of the p. intermedia group organisms with fusobacterium nucleatum was enhanced only in p. intermedia ahn 8290. in conclusion, our in vitro experiments indicate that estradiol regulates planktonic growth, coaggregation, polysaccharide production, and biofilm formation characteristics of p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, and p. pallens differently. these results may, at least partly, explain the differences seen in their contribution to the pathogenesis of pregnancy-related gingivitis.
