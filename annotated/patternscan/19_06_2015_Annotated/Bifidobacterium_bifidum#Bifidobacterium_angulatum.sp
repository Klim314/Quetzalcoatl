TI  == isolation of a bifidogenic peptide from the pepsin hydrolysate of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  == lactoferrin is an iron-binding glycoprotein found in the milk of most mammals for which various biological functions have been reported, such as antimicrobial activity and bifidogenic activity. in this study, we compared the bifidogenic activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf) and pepsin hydrolysate of blf (blfh), isolated bifidogenic peptide from blfh, and investigated the bifidogenic spectra  of blf, blfh, and its active peptide against 42 bifidobacterial strains comprising nine species. against bifidobacterium breve atcc 15700(t), minimal effective concentrations of blf and blfh were 300 and 10 mug/ml. against bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis atcc 15697(t), the minimal effective concentration of blfh was 30 mug/ml, and blf did not show bifidogenic activity within 300 mug/ml. as an active peptide, a heterodimer of a(1)-w(16) and l(43)-a(48) linked by a disulfide bond was isolated. previously, this peptide was identified as having antibacterial activity. an amino acid mixture with the same  composition as this peptide showed no bifidogenic activity. the strains of each species whose growth was highly promoted (>150%) by this peptide at 3.75 mum were as follows: b. breve (7 out of 7 strains [7/7]), b. longum subsp. infantis (5/5), bifidobacterium bifidum (2/5), b. longum subsp. longum (1/3), bifidobacterium adolescentis (3/6), bifidobacterium catenulatum (1/4), bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum (0/4), bifidobacterium dentium (0/5), and bifidobacterium angulatum (0/3). growth of none of the strains was highly promoted by blf at 3.75 mum. we demonstrated that blfh showed stronger bifidogenic activity than natural  blf, especially against infant-representative species, b. breve and b. longum subsp. infantis; furthermore, we isolated its active peptide. this is the first report about a bifidogenic peptide derived from blf.

TI  == quantification of human fecal bifidobacterium species by use of quantitative real-time pcr analysis targeting the groel gene.
AB  == quantitative real-time pcr assays targeting the groel gene for the specific enumeration of 12 human fecal bifidobacterium species were developed. the housekeeping gene groel (hsp60 in eukaryotes) was used as a discriminative marker for the differentiation of bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. animalis, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. catenulatum, b. dentium, b. gallicum, b. longum, b. pseudocatenulatum, b. pseudolongum, and b. thermophilum. the bifidobacterial chromosome contains a single copy of the groel gene, allowing the determination of the cell number by quantification of the groel copy number. real-time pcr assays were validated by comparing fecal samples spiked with known  numbers of a given bifidobacterium species. independent of the bifidobacterium species tested, the proportion of groel copies recovered from fecal samples spiked with 5 to 9 log(10) cells/g feces was approximately 50%. the quantification limit was 5 to 6 log(10) groel copies/g feces. the interassay variability was less than 10%, and variability between different dna extractions  was less than 23%. the method developed was applied to fecal samples from healthy adults and full-term breast-fed infants. bifidobacterial diversity in both adults and infants was low, with mostly </=3 bifidobacterium species and b. longum frequently detected. the predominant species in infant and adult fecal samples were b. breve and b. adolescentis, respectively. it was possible to distinguish b. catenulatum and b. pseudocatenulatum. we conclude that the groel gene is a suitable molecular marker for the specific and accurate quantification of human fecal bifidobacterium species by real-time pcr.

TI  == distribution of in vitro fermentation ability of lacto-n-biose i, a major building block of human milk oligosaccharides, in bifidobacterial strains.
AB  == this study investigated the potential utilization of lacto-n-biose i (lnb) by individual strains of bifidobacteria. lnb is a building block for the human milk  oligosaccharides, which have been suggested to be a factor for selective growth of bifidobacteria. a total of 208 strains comprising 10 species and 4 subspecies  were analyzed for the presence of the galacto-n-biose/lacto-n-biose i phosphorylase (glnbp) gene (lnpa) and examined for growth when lnb was used as the sole carbohydrate source. while all strains of bifidobacterium longum subsp.  longum, b. longum subsp. infantis, b. breve, and b. bifidum were able to grow on  lnb, none of the strains of b. adolescentis, b. catenulatum, b. dentium, b. angulatum, b. animalis subsp. lactis, and b. thermophilum showed any growth. in addition, some strains of b. pseudocatenulatum, b. animalis subsp. animalis, and  b. pseudolongum exhibited the ability to utilize lnb. with the exception for b. pseudocatenulatum, the presence of lnpa coincided with lnb utilization in almost  all strains. these results indicate that bifidobacterial species, which are the predominant species found in infant intestines, are potential utilizers of lnb. these findings support the hypothesis that glnbp plays a key role in the colonization of bifidobacteria in the infant intestine.

TI  == evaluation of the pcr method for identification of bifidobacterium species.
AB  == aims: bifidobacterium species are known for their beneficial effects on health and their wide use as probiotics. although various polymerase chain reaction (pcr) methods for the identification of bifidobacterium species have been published, the reliability of these methods remains open to question. methods and results: in this study, we evaluated 37 previously reported pcr primer sets designed to amplify 16s rdna, 23s rdna, intergenic spacer regions, or repetitive  dna sequences of various bifidobacterium species. conclusions: ten of 37 experimental primer sets showed specificity for b. adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. pseudocatenulatum, b. breve, b. bifidum, b. longum, b. longum biovar infantis and b. dentium. significance and impact of the study: the results suggest that published bifidobacterium primer sets should be re-evaluated for both reproducibility and specificity for the identification of bifidobacterium species using pcr. improvement of existing pcr methods will be needed to facilitate identification of other bifidobacterium strains, such as b. animalis, b. catenulatum, b. thermophilum and b. subtile.

TI  == qualitative and quantitative analyses of the bifidobacterial microbiota in the colonic mucosa of patients with colorectal cancer, diverticulitis and inflammatory bowel disease.
AB  == aim: to characterize the bifidobacterial microbiota of the colonic mucosa in patients with colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease or diverticuitis. methods: a sample of the distal colonic mucosa was taken during surgery from a total of 34 patients, twenty-one with diagnosed colorectal cancer, nine with diverticulitis and four with inflammatory bowel disease, requiring surgery for their condition.  bacterial dna was extracted from the resected mucosal samples and bifidobacterial mucosa-associated microbiota was qualitatively and quantitatively determined by means of qualitative and quantitative pcr. results: bifidobacteria were found in  100% of the samples from patients with diverticulitis or ibd and a 76% of those suffering colon cancer. the species b. longum and b. bifidum were the most widely found, followed by b. animalis, b. catenulatum and b. adolescentis. b. breve, b.  dentium and b. angulatum were not detected in any sample. a significantly higher  occurrence of b. longum was observed in patients with diverticulitis than in those with colon cancer or ibd (100%, 62% and 75%, respectively, p < 0.05). similar results were obtained for b. animalis (56%, 0% and 25%, p < 0.05), while  b. adolescentis was only found in the mucosa from patients with colon cancer (5 out of 21, 24%). at the quantitative level, patients with colon cancer or ibd showed lower counts of total bifidobacterium (4.94 and 5.91 vs 6.96 log cells/sample, respectively, p < 0.05) and of the species b. longum (4.05 and 4.79 vs 6.76, p < 0.05) than those with diverticulitis. conclusion: aberrancies in mucosa associated microbiota are present in different intestinal diseases. this may indicate a role of the microbiota in the pathogenesis of these diseases.

TI  == quantitative assessment of faecal bifidobacterial populations by real-time pcr using lanthanide probes.
AB  == aim: to develop real-time quantitative pcr methods, based on the use of probes labelled with a stable fluorescent lanthanide chelate, for the quantification of  different human faecal bifidobacterial populations. methods and results: the designed quantitative pcr assays were found to be specific for the corresponding  bifidobacterium species or groups (bifidobacterium longum group, bifidobacterium  catenulatum group, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium angulatum, bifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium dentium).  the detection limits of the methodologies used ranged between 2 x 10(5) and 9 x 10(3) cells g(-1) of faeces. the applicability of the developed assays was tested by analysing 20 human faecal samples. bif. longum group was found to be the qualitatively and quantitatively predominant bifidobacterial group. conclusions:  the real-time pcr procedures developed here are specific, accurate, rapid and easy methods for the quantification of bifidobacterium groups or species in human faecal samples. significance and impact of the study: the developed procedures will facilitate rapid and objective counting of large numbers of samples increasing our knowledge on the role of gut bifidobacterial microbiota in health  and disease. this will contribute to the efficient use of intestinal bacterial assays in research, food and pharmaceutical development as well as in the assessment of dietary management of diseases.

TI  == population dynamics of bifidobacterium species in human feces during raffinose administration monitored by fluorescence in situ hybridization-flow cytometry.
AB  == the population dynamics of bifidobacteria in human feces during raffinose administration were investigated at the species level by using fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) coupled with flow cytometry (fcm) analysis. although double-staining fish-fcm using both fluorescein isothiocyanate (fitc) and indodicarbocyanine (cy5) as labeling dyes for fecal samples has been reported, the analysis was interfered with by strong autofluorescence at the fitc fluorescence region because of the presence of autofluorescence particles/debris  in the fecal samples. we circumvented this problem by using only cy5 fluorescent  dye in the fish-fcm analysis. thirteen subjects received 2 g of raffinose twice a day for 4 weeks. fecal samples were collected, and the bifidobacterial populations were monitored using the established fish-fcm method. the results showed an increase in bifidobacteria from about 12.5% of total bacteria in the prefeeding period to about 28.7 and 37.2% after the 2-week and 4-week feeding periods, respectively. bifidobacterium adolescentis, the bifidobacterium catenulatum group, and bifidobacterium longum were the major species, in that order, at the prefeeding period, and these bacteria were found to increase nearly in parallel during the raffinose administration. during the feeding periods, indigenous bifidobacterial populations became more diverse, such that minor species in human adults, such as bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium bifidum,  bifidobacterium dentium, and bifidobacterium angulatum, proliferated. four weeks  after raffinose administration was stopped, the proportion of each major bifidobacterial species, as well as that of total bifidobacteria, returned to approximately the original values for the prefeeding period, whereas that of each minor species appeared to differ considerably from its original value. to the best of our knowledge, these results provide the first clear demonstration of the population dynamics of indigenous bifidobacteria at the species level in response to raffinose administration.

TI  == [a molecular-and-genetic analysis of species and strain diversity of bifidobacteria in early childhood].
AB  == the species and strain composition of bifidobacteria in 29 children both sexes, aged 8 to 16 months, was studied. species-specific primers and pcr were used to determine to which species the predominant strains of bifidobacteria, isolated from feces by cultural methods, belonged. bifidobacteria were found in 28 (96.5%) children; their number was 10.2 +/- 0.7 ecu per a gram of the material. b. longum and b. bifidum were frequent (71.4 and 53.5%, respectively). the level of quantitative detection used in the study also allowed revealing of b. catenulatum (17.9%) and b. breve (14.4%). a high titer of b. dentium was found in one case (3.6%). b. adolescentis and b. angulatum were not found in any patient. the average number of species found in one child was 1.7 +/- 0.7. rapd-pcr and investigation of plasmid profile were used to determine possible belonging of the isolates to different strains. the average number of strains per one sample was 2.3 +/- 1.2. nine unique plasmid bifidobacterial strains were isolated from 7 children. in 3 children the intestinal tract was found to be colonized by both plasmid and non-plasmid-carrying strains of one bifidobacterial species.

TI  == quantitative real-time pcr assays to identify and quantify fecal bifidobacterium  species in infants receiving a prebiotic infant formula.
AB  == a healthy intestinal microbiota is considered to be important for priming of the  infants' mucosal and systemic immunity. breast-fed infants typically have an intestinal microbiota dominated by different bifidobacterium species. it has been described that allergic infants have different levels of specific bifidobacterium species than healthy infants. for the accurate quantification of bifidobacterium  adolescentis, bifidobacterium angulatum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium catenulatum, bifidobacterium dentium, bifidobacterium infantis, and bifidobacterium longum in fecal samples, duplex 5' nuclease assays  were developed. the assays, targeting rrna gene intergenic spacer regions, were validated and compared with conventional pcr and fluorescent in situ hybridization methods. the 5' nuclease assays were subsequently used to determine the relative amounts of different bifidobacterium species in fecal samples from infants receiving a standard formula or a standard formula supplemented with galacto- and fructo-oligosaccharides (osf). a breast-fed group was studied in parallel as a reference. the results showed a significant increase in the total amount of fecal bifidobacteria (54.8% +/- 9.8% to 73.4% +/- 4.0%) in infants receiving the prebiotic formula (osf), with a diversity of bifidobacterium species similar to breast-fed infants. the intestinal microbiota of infants who received a standard formula seems to resemble a more adult-like distribution of bifidobacteria and contains relatively more b. catenulatum and b. adolescentis (2.71% +/- 1.92% and 8.11% +/- 4.12%, respectively, versus 0.15% +/- 0.11% and 1.38% +/- 0.98% for the osf group). in conclusion, the specific prebiotic infant  formula used induces a fecal microbiota that closely resembles the microbiota of  breast-fed infants also at the level of the different bifidobacterium species.

TI  == genetic heterogeneity and functional properties of intestinal bifidobacteria.
AB  == aims: the aim of the present study was to compare several molecular methods for the identification and genotyping of bifidobacteria, and further to investigate genetic heterogeneity and functional properties of bifidobacterial isolates from  intestinal samples of finnish adult subjects. methods and results: a total of 153 intestinal bifidobacterial isolates were included in initial screening and 34 isolates were further characterized. identification results obtained with pcr-elisa and ribotyping were well in accordance with each other, while randomly  amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) gave tentative identification only to bifidobacterium bifidum and to 65% of the b. longum isolates. the most commonly detected species were b. longum biotype longum followed by b. adolescentis and b. bifidum. in addition, b. animalis (lactis), b. angulatum and b. pseudocatenulatum were found. ribotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) proved to be discriminatory methods for bifidobacteria, but also rapd revealed intraspecies heterogeneity. besides two b. animalis (lactis) isolates with very close similarity to a commercially available probiotic strain, none of the intestinal isolates showed optimal survival in all tolerance (acid, bile and oxygen) or growth performance tests. conclusions: several species/strains of bifidobacteria  simultaneously colonize the gastrointestinal tract of healthy finnish adults and  intestinal bifidobacterium isolates were genetically heterogeneous. functional properties of bifidobacteria were strain-dependent. significance and impact of the study: applicability of ribotyping with the automated riboprinter system for  identification and genotyping of bifidobacteria was shown in the present study.

TI  == development of multi-color fish method for analysis of seven bifidobacterium species in human feces.
AB  == we have developed a multi-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) method  which detects, by a single reaction, all seven species of bifidobacterium (b. adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. catenulatum, b. dentium, and b. longum), the dominant bacteria in human feces. first, eight new types of oligonucleotide probe were designed, complementary with the 16s rrna sequence specific to genus bifidobacterium and each bifidobacterial species described above. using whole cell hybridization, the fluorescent intensity was measured against the bacterial species targeted by each probe, to show that each probe is  specific to the targeted bacteria and that the relative fluorescent intensity (rfi) as an indicator of probe accessibility is high at 61-117%. then, bacterial  species-specific probes were labeled with fluorochromes (fitc, tamra and cy5) in  seven different ways, singly or in combination. using these probes, seven species of bifidobacterium were differentially stained in mixed samples of cultured bacteria and feces from adult volunteers, proving the efficacy of this technique.

TI  == species specific identification of nine human bifidobacterium spp. in feces.
AB  == based on the 16s rdna sequences, species specific primers were designed for the rapid identification by dna amplification of nine human bifidobacterium spp., namely b. adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. catenulatum, b. dentium, b. infantis, b. longum, b. pseudocatenulatum. b. lactis currently included in dairy products was added to the series. the primers were designed to  target different positions of the 16s rdna, allowing the simultaneous identification of these ten species of bifidobacterium using two mixtures of primers. the identification procedure described in this paper was validated by establishing a correlation with an alui restriction pattern of the different full length amplified 16s rdna. this multiple primer dna amplification technique was applied for the identification of pure colonies of bifidobacterium spp. or directly from total bacteria recovered from human fecal samples. the technique was shown to be useful to detect dominant species and, when primers were used in  separate reactions, underrepresented species could be identified as well.

TI  == synthesis and fermentation properties of novel galacto-oligosaccharides by beta-galactosidases from bifidobacterium species.
AB  == beta-galactosidase enzymes were extracted from pure cultures of bifidobacterium angulatum, b. bifidum bb-12, b. adolescentis anb-7, b. infantis dsm-20088, and b. pseudolongum dsm-20099 and used in glycosyl transfer reactions to synthesize oligosaccharides from lactose. at a lactose concentration of 30% (wt/wt) oligosaccharide yields of 24.7 to 47.6% occurred within 7 h. examination of the products by thin-layer chromatography and methylation analysis revealed distinct  product derived spectra from each enzyme. these were found to be different to that of oligomate 55, a commercial prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharide. fermentation testing of the oligosaccharides showed an increase in growth rate, compared to oligomate 55, with products derived from b. angulatum, b. bifidum, b. infantis, and b. pseudolongum. however b. adolescentis had a lower growth rates on its oligosaccharide compared with oligomate 55. mixed culture testing of the b. bifidum bs-4 oligosaccharide showed that the overall prebiotic effect was equivalent to that of oligomate 55.

TI  == adhesion of bifidobacterium spp. to human intestinal mucus.
AB  == twenty-four bifidobacterium strains were examined for their ability to bind to immobilized human and bovine intestinal mucus glycoproteins. each of the tested bacteria exhibited its characteristic adhesion to human and bovine fecal mucus. no significant differences were found among the taxonomic species. among the tested bacteria, b. adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. catenulatum, b. infantis, b. longum and b. pseudocatenulatum adhered to human fecal mucus better than bovine fecal mucus, while the binding of b. animalis and  b. lactis was not preferential. these results suggest that the mucosal adhesive properties of bifidobacteria may be a strain dependent feature, and the mucosal binding of the human bifidobacteria may be more host specific.

TI  == distribution of bifidobacterial species in human intestinal microflora examined with 16s rrna-gene-targeted species-specific primers.
AB  == in order to clarify the distribution of bifidobacterial species in the human intestinal tract, a 16s rrna-gene-targeted species-specific pcr technique was developed and used with dnas extracted from fecal samples obtained from 48 healthy adults and 27 breast-fed infants. to cover all of the bifidobacterial species that have been isolated from and identified in the human intestinal tract, species-specific primers for bifidobacterium longum, b. infantis, b. dentium, and b. gallicum were developed and used with primers for b. adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. bifidum, b. breve, and the b. catenulatum group (b. catenulatum and b. pseudocatenulatum) that were developed in a previous study (t. matsuki, k. watanabe, r. tanaka, and h. oyaizu, fems microbiol. lett. 167:113-121, 1998). the specificity of the nine primers was confirmed by pcr, and the species-specific pcr method was found to be a useful means for identifying bifidobacterium strains isolated from human feces. the results of an examination  of bifidobacterial species distribution showed that the b. catenulatum group was  the most commonly found taxon (detected in 44 of 48 samples [92%]), followed by b. longum and b. adolescentis, in the adult intestinal bifidobacterial flora and  that b. breve, b. infantis, and b. longum were frequently found in the intestinal tracts of infants. the present study demonstrated that qualitative detection of the bifidobacterial species present in human feces can be accomplished rapidly and accurately.

TI  == rapid identification of human intestinal bifidobacteria by 16s rrna-targeted species- and group-specific primers.
AB  == on the basis of 16s rrna sequences, species- and group-specific primers for bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. bifidum, b. breve, the b. catenulatum group (b. catenulatum and b. pseudocatenulatum), and the b. longum group (b. longum and b. infantis), which are species commonly found in human intestinal tracts, were developed. the specificity of these primers was confirmed through the use of dna extracted from 46 strains of 31 bifidobacterium species, as well as 14 non-bifidobacterial species that are the predominant bacteria in the human intestinal tract. the present species-specific primers were applied to  the identification of 43 isolated strains, consisting of six strains of b. adolescentis, eight of the b. catenulatum group, seven of b. bifidum, nine of b.  breve, and 13 of the b. longum group.

TI  == growth, viability, and proteolytic activity of bifidobacteria in whole camel milk.
AB  == four species of bifidobacteria were evaluated for growth, viability, and proteolytic activity in whole camel milk, and comparison was made with whole cow  milk. growth of all species in either whole milk was characterized by the appearance of two logarithmic phases following anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees c for 36 h. the growth rate of bifidobacterium longum 15,707 was higher in camel  milk than in bovine milk and was higher for bifidobacterium angulatum 27,535 in bovine milk than in camel milk. bifidobacterium bifidum 2715 and bifidobacterium  breve 2258 showed the same trend as b. angulatum 27,535 after 16 h of postinoculation. viable counts of all species except b. bifidum 2715 increased in the fermented whole milks during the first 3 d of storage at 4 degrees c. however, such counts did not change in unfermented milk, except for b. longum 15,707, which showed an increase in viable counts after 12 d of storage. viability of all species in both fermented and unfermented milks was unaffected during refrigerated storage for 15 d. all species except b. longum 15,707 showed  higher proteolytic activity in fermented camel milk than in bovine milk. however, proteolytic activity of all species except b. breve 2258 started at d 9 in unfermented camel milk only and increased sharply until the end of the storage period.

TI  == digoxigenin-labeled deoxyribonucleic acid probes for the enumeration of bifidobacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == the numbers of bifidobacteria in fecal samples were specifically determined by colony hybridization with the mixture of digoxigenin-labeled dna probes that were prepared from whole chromosomal dna of bifidobacterium longum 6001 and bifidobacterium adolescentis 6003. these dna probes strongly hybridized with dna  of b. longum, b. adolescentis, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium suis, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium angulatum, and bifidobacterium animalis. detectable positive signals with dna of bifidobacterium pseudolongum ssp. pseudolongum, bifidobacterium catenulatum, and bifidobacterium  thermophilum were also found after hybridization. when dot-blot hybridization was performed with whole cells of 47 reference strains containing 11 species (16 strains) of bifidobacteria, all of the bifidobacteria tested could be specifically detected by using these dna probes; lactobacillus fermentum jcm 1173, however, showed a slight nonspecific signal. the counts of bifidobacteria by colony hybridization in the fecal samples of four of the five subjects were the same as the counts that were obtained by the conventional method using bl agar medium. furthermore, no significant difference existed in the number of bifidobacteria that were determined by either method.

TI  == comparison of carbohydrate substrate preferences in eight species of bifidobacteria.
AB  == eight species of bifidobacteria were tested for their abilities to grow on a range of monosaccharides (glucose, arabinose, xylose, galactose and mannose). in  contrast to the other sugars, glucose and galactose were utilized by all species  and, in general, specific growth rates were highest on these sugars. different substrate preferences were observed between species when the bacteria were grown  in the presence of all five monosaccharides. for example, glucose and xylose were coutilized by bifidobacterium longum, whereas glucose repressed uptake of all other sugars in b. bifidum and b. catenulatum. galactose was the preferred substrate with b. pseudolongum. in b. angulatum, glucose and galactose were utilized simultaneously. b. breve did not grow on arabinose when this sugar provided the sole source of energy. however, glucose and arabinose were preferentially taken up during growth on sugar mixtures.
