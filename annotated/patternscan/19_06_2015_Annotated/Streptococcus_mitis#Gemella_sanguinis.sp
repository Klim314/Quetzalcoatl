TI  == bacteremia after piezocision.
AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was to investigate the presence of transient  bacteremia after a piezocision procedure. methods: the sample consisted of 30 subjects (24 women, 6 men; mean age, 19.6 +/- 0.7 years; range, 18.1-22.4 years)  with the american society of anesthesiologists' physical status i. all patients had class i skeletal and dental relationships and had fixed orthodontic treatment with the damon system. the piezocision surgery was performed 1 week after the placement of the orthodontic appliances in all patients. two 20-ml venous blood samples were collected before and 30 to 60 seconds after the first microincision  using an aseptic technique. the samples were inoculated into bactec plus aerobic  and anaerobic blood culture bottles and were assessed in the bactec blood culture analyzer (becton dickinson diagnostic instrument systems, sparks, md). the results were analyzed statistically using the mcnemar test, with p <0.05 indicating statistical significance. results: no significant difference between the preoperative and postoperative samples was determined with respect to transient bacteremia (p = 0.250). no bacteremia was detected in the pretreatment  samples, although gemella sanguinis, streptococcus pluranimalium, and streptococcus mitis/oralis were detected in 3 postoperative blood samples. conclusions: the piezocision procedure might be related to transitory bacteremia. hence, orthodontists should consider the possibility of bacterial endocarditis in at-risk patients when piezocision is part of the treatment plan.

TI  == occurrence and evolution of the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species.
AB  == the distribution, genome location, and evolution of the four paralogous zinc metalloproteases, iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd, in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species were studied by in silico analysis of whole genomes and by activity screening of 154 representatives of 20 species. zmpb was ubiquitous in the mitis and salivarius groups of the genus streptococcus and in the genera gemella and granulicatella, with the exception of a fragmented  gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species with a nonhuman habitat. iga1 protease activity was observed in all members of s. pneumoniae, s. pseudopneumoniae, s. oralis, s. sanguinis, and gemella haemolysans, was variably  present in s. mitis and s. infantis, and absent in s. gordonii, s. parasanguinis, s. cristatus, s. oligofermentans, s. australis, s. peroris, and s. suis. phylogenetic analysis of 297 zmp sequences and representative housekeeping genes  provided evidence for an unprecedented selection for genetic diversification of the iga, zmpb, and zmpd genes in s. pneumoniae and evidence of very frequent intraspecies transfer of entire genes and combination of genes. presumably due to their adaptation to a commensal lifestyle, largely unaffected by adaptive mucosal immune factors, the corresponding genes in commensal streptococci have remained conserved. the widespread distribution and significant sequence diversity indicate an ancient origin of the zinc metalloproteases predating the emergence of the humanoid species. zmpb, which appears to be the ancestral gene, subsequently duplicated and successfully diversified into distinct functions, is  likely to serve an important but yet unknown housekeeping function associated with the human host. importance: the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd have been identified as crucial for virulence of the human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae. this study maps the presence of the  corresponding genes and enzyme activities in s. pneumoniae and in related commensal species of the genera streptococcus, gemella, and granulicatella. the distribution, genome location, and sequence diversification indicate that zmpb is the ancestral gene predating the evolution of today's humanoid species. the zmpb  protease may play an important but yet unidentified role in the association of streptococci of the mitis and salivarius groups with their human host, as it is ubiquitous in these two groups, except for a fragmented gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species not associated with humans. the relative sequence  diversification of the iga1 protease, zmpb, and zmpd is striking evidence of differences in selection for diversification of these surface-exposed proteins in the pathogen s. pneumoniae compared to the closely related commensal streptococci.

TI  == in vitro activity of daptomycin against clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == we determined the activity of daptomycin, a recently fda-approved antimicrobial agent, against clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria, including viridans group streptococci (16 streptococcus mitis species group, 12 s. mutans species group, 9 s. anginosus species group, 8 s. sanguinis species group, 5 s. salivarius species group) from patients with infective endocarditis, 32 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, 32 high-level penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, 38 vancomycin-resistant enterococci (including 1 linezolid-resistant isolate), and the following unusual gram-positive bacteria: 3 listeria monocytogenes, 4 erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, 9 corynebacterium species, 10 abiotrophia/granulicatella species, 2 rothia (stomatococcus) mucilaginosus, and 4 gemella morbillorum. daptomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)(90) values for the viridans group streptococci, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, and enterococcus species were 0.5, 0.5, < or =0.125, and 4 microg/ml, respectively. the daptomycin mic range for the unusual gram-positive bacteria was < or =0.125-2 microg/ml. we conclude that daptomycin has in vitro activity against viridans group streptococci associated with endocarditis as well as against several types  of unusual gram-positive bacteria that can cause endocarditis.
