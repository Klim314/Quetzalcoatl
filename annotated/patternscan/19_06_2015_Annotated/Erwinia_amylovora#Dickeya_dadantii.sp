TI  == scavenging iron: a novel mechanism of plant immunity activation by microbial siderophores.
AB  == siderophores are specific ferric iron chelators synthesized by virtually all microorganisms in response to iron deficiency. we have previously shown that they promote infection by the phytopathogenic enterobacteria dickeya dadantii and erwinia amylovora. siderophores also have the ability to activate plant immunity. we have used complete arabidopsis transcriptome microarrays to investigate the global transcriptional modifications in roots and leaves of arabidopsis (arabidopsis thaliana) plants after leaf treatment with the siderophore deferrioxamine (dfo). physiological relevance of these transcriptional modifications was validated experimentally. immunity and heavy-metal homeostasis  were the major processes affected by dfo. these two physiological responses could be activated by a synthetic iron chelator ethylenediamine-di(o-hydroxyphenylacetic) acid, indicating that siderophores eliciting activities rely on their strong iron-chelating capacity. dfo was able to protect arabidopsis against the pathogenic bacterium pseudomonas syringae pv tomato dc3000. siderophore treatment caused local modifications of iron distribution in leaf cells visible by ferrocyanide and diaminobenzidine-h(2)o(2)  staining. metal quantifications showed that dfo causes a transient iron and zinc  uptake at the root level, which is presumably mediated by the metal transporter iron regulated transporter1 (irt1). defense gene expression and callose deposition in response to dfo were compromised in an irt1 mutant. consistently, plant susceptibility to d. dadantii was increased in the irt1 mutant. our work shows that iron scavenging is a unique mechanism of immunity activation in plants. it highlights the strong relationship between heavy-metal homeostasis and immunity.

TI  == top 10 plant pathogenic bacteria in molecular plant pathology.
AB  == many plant bacteriologists, if not all, feel that their particular microbe should appear in any list of the most important bacterial plant pathogens. however, to our knowledge, no such list exists. the aim of this review was to survey all bacterial pathologists with an association with the journal molecular plant pathology and ask them to nominate the bacterial pathogens they would place in a  'top 10' based on scientific/economic importance. the survey generated 458 votes  from the international community, and allowed the construction of a top 10 bacterial plant pathogen list. the list includes, in rank order: (1) pseudomonas  syringae pathovars; (2) ralstonia solanacearum; (3) agrobacterium tumefaciens; (4) xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae; (5) xanthomonas campestris pathovars; (6) xanthomonas axonopodis pathovars; (7) erwinia amylovora; (8) xylella fastidiosa;  (9) dickeya (dadantii and solani); (10) pectobacterium carotovorum (and pectobacterium atrosepticum). bacteria garnering honourable mentions for just missing out on the top 10 include clavibacter michiganensis (michiganensis and sepedonicus), pseudomonas savastanoi and candidatus liberibacter asiaticus. this  review article presents a short section on each bacterium in the top 10 list and  its importance, with the intention of initiating discussion and debate amongst the plant bacteriology community, as well as laying down a benchmark. it will be  interesting to see, in future years, how perceptions change and which bacterial pathogens enter and leave the top 10.
