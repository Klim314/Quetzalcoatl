in vitro interaction of chronic wound bacteria in biofilms.
objective: to use in vitro biofilm models of wound bacterial isolates and compare the biofilms produced for different combinations of wound bacterial species. method: in vitro biofilms, generated by pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus oralis and micrococcus luteus in microtitre plates and a constant depth film fermentor (cdff), were studied. the tested isolates all originated from chronic venous leg ulcers. biofilms of individual and dual combinations of these species were generated in microtitre plate wells at 37 degrees c for 24-96 hours and also in the cdff for 7 days. the extent of biofilm formation from these systems was then measured using crystal violet staining and/or total viable counts. results: all the chronic wound bacteria formed biofilms (both individually and in mixed culture) in these models. in mixed species microtitre plate biofilms, both p. aeruginosa and s. aureus appeared to antagonise biofilm formation by s. oralis and m. luteus, with p. aeruginosa completely inhibiting the growth of these organisms. similar effects were evident in the cdff model, when all four bacterial species were added simultaneously, with m. luteus being 'out-competed' by the other organisms present and occurring at numbers at the limits of detection; however, there was an apparent increase in the numbers of s. oralis compared with its single culture equivalent. conclusion: the study highlighted differences in biofilm formation ability for the tested species in both closed and open model systems. using dual species biofilms, distinct species antagonism was observed with apparent antagonism of pathogenic species over 'commensal' ones. such a finding provides insight into possible bacterial interactions during development of 'non-healing' wound biofilms.
identification of a bioactive compound isolated from brazilian propolis type 6.
a prenylated benzophenone, hyperibone a, was isolated from the hexane fraction of brazilian propolis type 6. its structure was determined by spectral analysis including 2d nmr. this compound exhibited cytotoxic activity against hela tumor cells (ic(50)=0.1756microm), strong antimicrobial activity (mic range-0.73-6.6microg/ml; mbc range-2.92-106microg/ml) against streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus oralis, staphylococcus aureus, and actinomyces naeslundii, and the results of its cytotoxic and antimicrobial activities were considered good.
study of viridans streptococci and staphylococcus species in cleft lip and palate patients before and after surgery.
objective: to determine the effect of surgery on types and colony count of streptococcus and staphylococcus species in cleft lip and palate (clp) patients. design: saliva samples were collected after the morning meal by placing a sterile cotton swab in the vestibule of the oral cavity from cleft lip and palate patients immediately preoperative and 12 weeks postoperative. normal children were examined as a control group. samples were cultured; staphylococcus and streptococcus isolates were identified and quantified. patients: fifteen cleft lip and palate patients and 22 normal children, aged 3 to 39 months were examined. results: streptococcus mitis biovar 1, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus oralis of the viridans group of streptococci were the most commonly found in normal children, as well as in cleft lip and palate children. in the cleft lip and palate group, mean streptococcal count was 32.41 (29.80) and 46.46 (42.80) in the pre- and postoperative periods, respectively; in the normal group, the count was 20.93 (27.93) and 49.92 (34.72) at 0 week and 12 weeks, respectively. staphylococcus aureus was the most common staphylococcus species found in clp patients, representing 47.4% postoperatively. in the cleft lip and palate children, mean staphylococcal count was 5.34 (8.13) and 0.56 (0.92) in the pre- and postoperative periods, respectively; in normal children, the count was 0.82 (1.98) and 0.60 (2.55) at 0 and 12 weeks, respectively. the differences were statistically significant only for the staphylococcal count between pre- and postoperative periods in children with cleft lip and palate as tested by analysis of variance (p < .05). conclusions: cleft lip and palate patients had more colonization by s. aureus compared with normal children, and the colony count decreased significantly following surgical repair of the cleft lip and palate.
