TI  - Antibacterial activity of ovary extract from sea urchin Diadema setosum.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sea urchin gonad is considered as a highly prized delicacy in several  countries. It is also rich in valuable bioactive compounds including polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and beta-carotene. This study was undertaken to examine the antimicrobial properties of the ovary extract from sea urchin Diadema setosum against selected Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ovary extract was obtained using two different solvents such as methanol and chloroform. The obtained extract was used to examine its potential antimicrobial properties against the following 11 bacterial species using the disc diffusion method: Gram-negative bacteria (Salmonella typhi, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aeromonas hydrophila, Acinetobacter sp, Citrobacter freundii and Klebsiella pneumonia) and Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus). The activity was measured in terms of zone of inhibition (mm). RESULTS: The methanol extract exhibited a higher zone of inhibition against all the bacteria taken for examination. Whereas, the ovary extract obtained by chloroform did not show any antimicrobial activity against S. typhi, S. epidermidis, C. freundii and K. pneumonia. The results indicated that the ovary extract obtained by methanol extracts are capable of inhibiting the growth of pathogenic microbes taken for analysis. Moreover, the result indicates the presence of antimicrobial agents in sea urchin ovary. CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that the ovary extract of D. setosum may be a potential source of antimicrobial agent for pathogenic microorganisms.
TI  - Design of a papain immobilized antimicrobial food package with curcumin as a crosslinker.
AB  - Contamination of food products by spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms during post process handling is one of the major causes for food spoilage and food borne illnesses. The present green sustainable approach describes the covalent immobilization of papain to LDPE (low density polyethylene), HDPE (high density polyethylene), LLDPE (linear low density polyethylene) and PCL (polycaprolactam) with curcumin as the photocrosslinker. About 50% of curcumin and 82-92% of papain were successfully immobilized on these polymers. After 30 days, the free enzyme retained 87% of its original activity, while the immobilized enzyme retained more than 90% of its activity on these polymers. Papain crosslinked to LLDPE exhibited the best antibiofilm properties against Acinetobacter sp. KC119137.1 and Staphylococcus aureus NCIM 5021 when compared to the other three polymers, because of the highest amount of enzyme immobilized on this surface. Papain acts by damaging the cell membrane. The enzyme is able to reduce the amount of carbohydrate and protein contents in the biofilms formed by these organisms. Meat wrapped with the modified LDPE and stored at 4 degrees C showed 9 log reduction of these organisms at the end of the seventh day when compared to samples wrapped with the bare polymer. This method of crosslinking can be used on polymers with or without functional groups and can be adopted to bind any type of antimicrobial agent.
TI  - Microbiological characteristics of sepsis in a University hospital.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Microbiological characteristics of sepsis and antimicrobial resistance are well studied, although in State University of Campinas, no data has been published yet. METHODS: The main agents related to sepsis and antimicrobial resistance were analyzed. The blood culture records requested from 4,793 hospitalized patients were analyzed. The samples were processed using the Bact/Alert(R) system for agent identification and antimicrobial susceptibility. RESULTS: A total of 1,017 patients met the inclusion criteria for a sepsis diagnosis, with 2,309 samples tested (2.27 samples/patient). There were 489 positive samples (21% positive) isolated from 337 patients (33.13%), but more rigorous criteria excluding potential contaminants resulted in analysis being restricted to 266 patients (315 agents). The prevalent microorganisms were coagulase negative Staphylococcus (CNS) (15.87%), Escherichia coli (13.0%), Staphylococcus aureus (11.7%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.8%), Enterobacter sp (9.5%), Acinetobacter baumannii (9.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.7%) and Candida sp (5.1%). Examining antimicrobial resistance in the agents revealed that 51% of the S. aureus isolates were methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and 80% of the CNS isolates were oxacillin-resistant. For A. baumannii, the ideal profile drugs were ampicillin sulbactam and piperacillin/tazobactam, and for P. aeruginosa, they were piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftazidime. Enterobacteria showed on average 32.5% and 35.7% resistance to beta-lactams and ciprofloxacin, respectively. When all Gram-negative bacteria were considered, the resistance to beta-lactams rose to 40.5%, and the resistance to ciprofloxacin rose to 42.3%. CONCLUSIONS: Eighty percent of the agents identified in blood cultures from patients with sepsis belonged to a group of eight different agents. For empirical treatment, carbapenems and vancomycin unfortunately still remain the best therapeutic choice, except for A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa, for which piperacillin/tazobactan is the best option.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of Quercus infectoria gall extracts against multidrug resistant bacteria.
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of plants have long been evaluated for their promising use as antimicrobial agent and in minimizing the unwanted resistance effects of microorganisms. The study was conducted to evaluate the antibacterial activity of Quercus infectoria gall crude extracts against multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria in vitro. The screening test was determined by disc diffusion technique using sterile filter paper discs impregnated with 1 mg/ disc (50 mg/ml) aqueous and ethanol extracts of Q. infectoria galls tested on five selected MDR bacterial strains. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined using the twofold serial micro dilution technique at concentration ranging from 5.00 mg/ml to 0.01 mg/ml. The minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) was determined by sub culturing the microtitre wells showing no turbidity on the agar plate to obtain the MBC value. Both extracts showed substantial inhibitory effects against methicillin resistant coagulase negative Staphylococcus (MRCoNS) and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). A slightly reduced inhibitory zone diameter was observed with MDR Acinetobacter sp. while no inhibitory effect was displayed among the extended spectrum beta lactamases (ESBL) K. pneumoniae and ESBL E. coli isolates. A significant difference in the zone sizes between both extracts was only observed in MRSA (p < 0.05). The MIC values ranged from 0.08 mg/ml to 0.63 mg/ml for aqueous and ethanol extracts against MRSA, MRCoNS and MDR Acinetobacter sp. while their MBC to MIC ratio values were 2 and less. The Q. infectoria gall extracts have shown very promising in vitro antibacterial activities and may be considered as a potentially good source of antimicrobial agent especially against MDR Gram positive bacteria.
TI  - Characterization of a potential beta-lactamase inhibitory metabolite from a marine Streptomyces sp. PM49 active against multidrug-resistant pathogens.
AB  - Actinobacteria is a prolific producer of complex natural products; we isolated a  potential marine Streptomyces sp. PM49 strain from Bay of Bengal coastal area of India. The strain PM49 exhibited highly efficient antibacterial properties on multidrug-resistant pathogens with a zone of inhibition of 14-17 mm. SSF was adopted for the production of the secondary metabolites from PM49 with ISP2; utilizing agricultural wastes for compound extraction was also attempted. Bioactive fraction of Rf value 0.69 resolved using chloroform and ethyl acetate (1:1, v/v) was obtained and subjected to further analysis. Based on UV, IR, ESI-MS, and (1)H and (13)C NMR spectral analysis, it was revealed that the compound is closely similar to cyslabdan with a molecular mass of 467.66 corresponding to the molecular formula C25H41NO5S. ESBL and MBL production was screened in the hospital test isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus. PCR amplification in the phenotypically positive strains was positive for bla IMP, bla SHV, bla CTX-M, and mec genes. The beta-lactamase enzyme from tested strains had cephalosporinase activity with a 31-kDa protein and isolated compound from the strain possessing beta-lactamase inhibitory potential. MIC of the active fraction was 16-32 mug/ml on ATCC strains; the ceftazidime and meropenem sensitive and resistant test strains showed MIC of 64-256 mug/ml. The Streptomyces sp. PM49 aerial mycelium was rectiflexibile; the 16S rRNA showed 99 % identity with Streptomyces rochei and submitted at Genbank with accession no JX904061.1.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of prodigiosin isolated from Serratia marcescens UFPEDA 398.
AB  - Prodigiosin is an alkaloid and natural red pigment produced by Serratia marcescens. Prodigiosin has antimicrobial, antimalarial and antitumor properties and induces apoptosis in T and B lymphocytes. These properties have piqued the interest of researchers in the fields of medicine, pharmaceutics and different industries. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of prodigiosin against pathogenic micro-organisms. The red pigments produced by S. marcescens exhibited absorption at 534 nm, Rf of 0.59 and molecular weight of 323 m/z. Antimicrobial activity was tested against oxacillin-resistant Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Acinetobacter sp. and oxacillin-resistant S. aureus. The standard antibiotics employed were ampicillin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin and oxacillin. The disc-diffusion tests demonstrated significant inhibition zones for S. aureus (35 +/- 0.6), E. faecalis (22 +/- 1.0) and S. pyogenes (14 +/- 0.6). However, prodigiosin showed resistance to E. coli, P. aeruginosa and acinetobacter, where no significant formation of inhibitory halos were observed. We determined the inhibitory minimum concentrations and bactericidal for 20 strains of oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (ORSA). The pattern was the antibiotic oxacillin. The minimum inhibitory concentrations observed ranged from 1, 2 and 4.0 mug/mL, respectively, while the minimum bactericidal concentrations ranged from 2, 4, 8 and 16 mug/mL. The S. marcescens prodigiosin produced by showed bactericidal and bacteriostatic effect showing promising antimicrobial activity and suggesting future studies regarding its applicability in antibiotics therapies directed ORSA.
TI  - Ecological competition and the incidence of Acinetobacter baumannii bloodstream infections in a teaching hospital in Southeastern Brazil.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recently, pathogen ecology has been recognized as an important epidemiological determinant of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). Acinetobacter baumannii is one of the most important agents known to cause HAIs. It is widespread in healthcare settings and exhibits seasonal variations in incidence. Little is known about the impact of competition with other hospital pathogens on the incidence of A. baumannii infection. METHODS: We conducted an ecological study, enrolling patients who presented with healthcare-associated bloodstream infections (HA-BSIs) from 2005 to 2010 at a 450-bed teaching hospital in Brazil. HA-BSIs were said to be present when bacteria or fungi were recovered from blood cultures collected at least three days after admission. Monthly incidence rates were calculated for all HA-BSIs (overall or caused by specific pathogens or groups of pathogens). Multivariate Poisson regression models were used to identify the impacts of the incidence of several pathogens on the incidence of A. baumannii. RESULTS: The overall incidence rate of HA-BSI caused by A. baumannii was 2.5 per 10,000 patient-days. In the multivariate analysis, the incidence of HA-BSI caused by A. baumannii was negatively associated with the incidence rates of HA-BSI due to Staphylococcus aureus (rate ratio [RR]=0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.80-0.97), Enterobacter spp. (RR=0.84; 95%CI=0.74-0.94) and a pool of less common gram-negative pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that competition between pathogens influences the etiology of HA-BSIs. It would be beneficial to take these findings into account in infection control policies.
TI  - Antibacterial secondary metabolites from an endophytic fungus, Eupenicillium sp.  LG41.
AB  - Two new compounds containing the decalin moiety, eupenicinicols A and B (1 and 2), two new sirenin derivatives, eupenicisirenins A and B (3 and 4), and four known compounds, (2S)-butylitaconic acid (5), (2S)-hexylitaconic acid (6), xanthomegnin (7), and viridicatumtoxin (8), were isolated from an endophytic fungus, Eupenicillium sp. LG41, harbored in the roots of the Chinese medicinal plant Xanthium sibiricum. Their structures were confirmed through combined spectroscopic analysis (NMR and HRMS(n)), and their absolute configurations were deduced by ECD calculations or optical rotation data. Since the endophytic fungus was isolated from the roots, the antibacterial efficacies of the compounds 1-6 were investigated against Bacillus subtilis and Acinetobacter sp. BD4, which typically inhabit soil, as well as the clinically important Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. (2S)-Butylitaconic acid (5) and (2S)-hexylitaconic acid (6) exhibited pronounced efficacy against Acinetobacter sp., corroborating the notion that root-endophytes provide chemical defense to the host plants. Compound 2 was highly active against the clinically relevant S. aureus. By comparing 1 with 2, it was revealed that altering the substitution at C-11 could drastically increase the antibacterial efficacy of 1. Our study reveals plausible ecological roles of the endophyte and its potential pharmaceutical use as a source of antibacterial compounds.
TI  - Penialidins A-C with strong antibacterial activities from Penicillium sp., an endophytic fungus harboring leaves of Garcinia nobilis.
AB  - Three new polyketides named penialidins A-C (1-3), along with one known compound, citromycetin (4), were isolated from an endophytic fungus, Penicillium sp., harbored in the leaves of the Cameroonian medicinal plant Garcinia nobilis. Their structures were elucidated by means of spectroscopic and spectrometric methods (NMR and HRMS(n)). The antibacterial efficacies of the new compounds (1-3) were tested against the clinically-important risk group 2 (RG2) bacterial strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The ecologically imposing strains of E. coli (RG1), Bacillus subtilis and Acinetobacter sp. BD4 were also included in the assay. Compound 3 exhibited pronounced activity against the clinically-relevant S. aureus as well as against B. subtilis comparable to that of the reference standard (streptomycin). Compound 2 was also highly-active against S. aureus. By comparing the structures of the three new compounds (1-3), it was revealed that altering the substitutions at C-10 and C-2 can significantly increase the antibacterial activity of 1.
TI  - Hospital acquired infections: preventable cause of mortality in spinal cord injury patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is an alarming rate of morbidity and mortality observed in the  trauma victims who suffer spinal cord injuries (SCI). Such patients are admitted immediately and stay for longer periods of time and thus are at risk of acquiring nosocomial infections. AIMS: The aim of this study is to analyze the primary cause of mortality in SCI patients. DESIGN: Retrospective study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective 4 year analysis of the postmortem data of 341 patients who died after sustaining SCI at a tertiary care apex trauma center of India. Epidemiological data of patients including the type of trauma, duration of hospital stay, cause of death and microbiological data were recorded. RESULTS: On autopsy, out of 341 patients, the main cause of death in the SCI patients was ascertained to be infection/septicemia in 180 (52.7%) patients, the rest 161 (47.2%) died due to severe primary injury. Respiratory tract infections (36.4%) were predominant followed by urinary tract infections (32.2%), blood stream infections (22.2%), wound infections (7.1%) and meningitis reported in only 5 (2.1%) cases. Acinetobacter sp (40%) was the predominant organism isolated, followed by Pseudomonas sp (16.3%), Klebsiella sp (15.1%), Candida sp (7.8%), Escherichia coli (6.9%), Staphylococcus aureus (6.9%), Proteus sp (3.3%), Enterobacter sp and Burkholderia sp (two cases each) and Stenotrophomonas sp (one case). A high level of multidrug resistance was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital acquired infections (HAI) are leading cause of loss of young lives in trauma patients; hence efforts should be made to prevent HAIs.
TI  - Chemical composition, antibacterial and cytotoxic activities of the essential oil from the flowers of Tunisian Convolvulus althaeoides L.
AB  - This study describes the chemical composition and evaluates the antibacterial and the cytotoxic effects of the essential oil from the flowers of Convolvulus althaeoides. Its chemical composition, determined by GC and GC-MS, is reported for the first time. A total of 24 compounds, accounting for 95.5% of the total oil, have been identified. The oil was characterised by a high proportion of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (36.3%), followed by oxygenated sesquiterpenes (34.7%) and oxygenated monoterpenes (24.5%). The main compounds were germacrene D (12.5%), T-cadinol (11.8%) and verbenone (6.9%). The essential oil was tested for its antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and the clinical strain Acinetobacter sp. as well as facts cytotoxic activity towards the human breast cancer cells MCF-7. This oil did not exhibit significant antibacterial activity against the tested bacteria; however, it exerted a significant cytotoxic activity against the tested cell line (IC(5)(0) = 8.16 mug/mL).
TI  - Acanthamoeba and bacteria produce antimicrobials to target their counterpart.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the microbial ecosystem, microbes compete for space and nutrients. Consequently, some have developed the ability to kill or inhibit the growth of other competing microbes by producing antimicrobial substances. As the 'producer' species are generally immune to these substances, their compounds act on the competing microbial species and give the producer more space and access to nutrients for growth. Many currently used antibiotics were developed by exploiting this potential of certain microbes. FINDINGS: Here, the free-living amoeba, Acanthamoeba castellanii, was investigated for its antibacterial activity against representative Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, while bacterial isolates were tested for their anti-amoebic properties. Conditioned medium from A. castellanii showed remarkable bactericidal properties against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) exhibiting almost 100% kill rate, but had limited effect against Acinetobacter sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE). Similarly, the conditioned medium of E. coli K1 and Enterobacter sp., exhibited potent anti-Acanthamoebic effects in a concentration-dependent manner. Conditioned media of Acanthamoeba, E. coli K1 and Enterobacter sp. showed no cytotoxicity in vitro when tested against human brain microvascular endothelial cells. Active molecule/s in aforementioned amoebic and two bacterial conditioned media were 5 - 10 kDa, and <5 kDa respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A. castellanii conditioned medium showed potent bactericidal properties against MRSA. The active molecule(s) are heat- and pronase-resistant, and in the 5 to 10 kDa molecular mass range. Contrary to this, E. coli K1 and Enterobacter sp., conditioned medium showed anti-amoebic effects that are <5 kDa in molecular mass, suggestive of active metabolites.
TI  - Intravascular catheter related infections and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of isolated bacteria in a tertiary care hospital of Bangladesh.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the rate of bacterial colonisation and catheter related blood stream infections (CRBSI) together with the antibiotic susceptibility patterns in a tertiary care hospital. CRBSI was detected with semi-quantitative and quantitative methods. The antimicrobial susceptible patterns of the isolated organisms were performed by Kirby Bauer disk diffusion method. The rate of catheter colonisation and CRBSI were 42.1% and 14% (16.1/1000 catheter days) respectively. The most common causative pathogens were Pseudomonas sp. (23.7%), Acinetobacter sp. (18.4%), Staphylococcus aureus (13.2%) and Enterobacteriaceae (10.5%). The rate of isolation of methicillin resistance S. aureus, imipenem resistant Pseudomonas sp. and extended spectrum beta lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae were 60%, 44.0% and 100%. The result of this study would be useful for control and treatment of CRBSI.
TI  - Microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of May bryndza cheese.
AB  - Diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of May bryndza cheese, a traditional Slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. Quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, E. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and Geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. Diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. The culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese, lactobacilli, lactococci and Geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) CFU/g, 10(9) CFU/g and 10(5) CFU/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. The diversity of bacteria encompassed Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter guillouiae, Acinetobacter sp., Acinetobacter johnsonii, Citrobacter braakii, Clostridium bartlettii, Corynebacterium callunae, Corynebacterium maris, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter asburiae, Enterobacter hormaechei, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus pallens, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus haemolyticus, Hafnia alvei, Kluyvera cryocrescens, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactococcus garvieae, Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, Lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "Leuconostoc garlicum", Mannheimia glucosida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pseudomonas sp., Ps. fluorescens, "Ps. reactans", Raoultella ornithinolytica, R. terrigena, "Rothia arfidiae", Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Staph. felis, Staph. pasteuri, Staph. sciuri, Staph. xylosus, Streptococcus parauberis, Str. thermophilus and Variovorax paradoxus. The diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed Alternaria alternata, "Ascomycete sp.", Aspergillus fumigatus, Beauveria brongniartii, Candida xylopsoci, C. inconspicua, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Debaromyces hansenii, Fomes fomentarius, Galactomyces candidus, Gymnoascus reesii, Chaetomium globosum, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Metarhizium anisopliae, Penicillium aurantiogriseum, P. camemberti, P. freii, P. polonicum, P. viridicatum, Pichia kudriavzevii, Sordaria alcina, Trichosporon lactis and Yarrowia lipolytica.
TI  - Trends in bacterial resistance in a tertiary university hospital over one decade.
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate bacterial resistance trends, infection sites and the relationship between resistance and admittance to the intensive care unit (ICU). A total of 53,316 bacteria identified between 1999 and 2008 were evaluated. Multidrug resistance was characterized when gram-negative bacilli (GNB) presented resistance to two or more classes of antibiotics. Gram-positive cocci (CPC) were assessed for resistance to penicillin, oxacillin and vancomycin. GNB were the most common (66.1%) isolate. There was a 3.7-fold overall increase in multidrug resistant GNB over the study period; Acinetobacter baumanii and Staphylococcus aureus were the most prevalent. Highest increases were recorded for Klebsiella pneumoniae (14.6-fold) and enterococci (73-fold). The resistance rates for GNB and GPC were 36% and 51.7%, respectively. Most multidrug resistant GNB and GPC were recovered from ICU patients (p-value<0.001). Vancomycin-resistant enterococci were isolated during this decade with an increase of 18.7% by 2008. These data confirm the worldwide trend in multidrug bacterial resistance.
TI  - Surveillance of multidrug resistant uropathogenic bacteria in hospitalized patients in Indian.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To record surveillance, antibiotic resistance of uropathogens of hospitalized patients over a period of 18 months. METHODS: Urine samples from wards and cabins were used for isolating urinary tract infection (UTI)-causing bacteria that were cultured on suitable selective media and identified by biochemical tests; and their antibiograms were ascertained by Kirby-Bauer's disc diffusion method, in each 6-month interval of the study period, using 18 antibiotics of five different classes. RESULTS: From wards and cabins, 1 245 samples were collected, from which 996 strains of bacteria belonging to 11 species were isolated, during April 2011 to September 2012. Two Gram-positive, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis), and nine Gram-negative bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii, Citrobacter sp., Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated. Both S. aureus and E. faecalis were vancomycin resistant, and resistant-strains of all pathogens increased in each 6-month period of study. Particularly, all Gram-negatives were resistant to nitrofurantoin and co-trimoxazole, the most preferred antibiotics of empiric therapy for UTI. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiograms of 11 UTI-causing bacteria recorded in this study indicated moderately higher numbers of strains resistant to each antibiotic studied, generating the fear of precipitating fervent episodes in public health particularly with bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and S. aureus. Moreover, vancomycin resistance in strains of S. aureus and E. faecalis is a matter of concern.
TI  - Bloodstream infection among adults in Phnom Penh, Cambodia: key pathogens and resistance patterns.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bloodstream infections (BSI) cause important morbidity and mortality  worldwide. In Cambodia, no surveillance data on BSI are available so far. METHODS: From all adults presenting with SIRS at Sihanouk Hospital Centre of HOPE (July 2007-December 2010), 20 ml blood was cultured. Isolates were identified using standard microbiological techniques; antibiotic susceptibilities were assessed using disk diffusion and MicroScan(R), with additional E-test, D-test and double disk test where applicable, according to CLSI guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 5714 samples from 4833 adult patients yielded 501 clinically significant organisms (8.8%) of which 445 available for further analysis. The patients' median age was 45 years (range 15-99 y), 52.7% were women. HIV-infection and diabetes were present in 15.6% and 8.8% of patients respectively. The overall mortality was 22.5%. Key pathogens included Escherichia coli (n = 132; 29.7%), Salmonella spp. (n = 64; 14.4%), Burkholderia pseudomallei (n = 56; 12.6%) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 53; 11.9%). Methicillin resistance was seen in 10/46 (21.7%) S. aureus; 4 of them were co-resistant to erythromycin, clindamycin, moxifloxacin and sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMX-TMP). We noted combined resistance to amoxicillin, SMX-TMP and ciprofloxacin in 81 E. coli isolates (62.3%); 62 isolates (47.7%) were confirmed as producers of extended spectrum beta-lactamase. Salmonella isolates displayed high rates of multidrug resistance (71.2%) with high rates of decreased ciprofloxacin susceptibility (90.0%) in Salmonella Typhi while carbapenem resistance was observed in 5.0% of 20 Acinetobacter sp. isolates. CONCLUSIONS: BSI in Cambodian adults is mainly caused by difficult-to-treat pathogens. These data urge for microbiological capacity building, nationwide surveillance and solid interventions to contain antibiotic resistance.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in bacterial isolates from a delhi hospital: one year outcomes.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance and hospital acquired infections have become an important public health issue. Data on pathogen and antibiotic resistance is important for physicians, microbiologists and infection control officials but limited information on antibiotic resistance prevents pathogen specific therapy and propels antibiotic misuse. A retrospective review of bacterial isolation and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles in the in- and outpatients of a Delhi hospital between January 2009-December 2009 was performed. A total of 1772 pathogens causing bacterial infections were recorded during the study period January 2009-December 2009. The most frequently encountered bacterial pathogens were Escherichia coli (40.51%), Klebsiella spp. (14.84%) and Staphylococcus aureus (13.99%). We encountered high resistance to ciprofloxacin in Enterobactereaceae family, i.e., 32.5%. Aminoglycosides, once considered optimum for broad spectrum coverage of pathogens for almost all systemic infections, are now showing high rate of resistance as was noted in Acinetobacter sp. (57.14%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (69.2%). Antibiotic susceptibility results show a higher level of resistance to cotrimoxazole, cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin which are easily available, orally administered and cheaper and thus are considered a better option for the patients. This study provides insight into the problem of resistance in bacterial pathogens in Delhi. Our results demonstrated that, in general, isolates have high rates of resistance to antibiotics commonly used in developing countries. Guidelines for surveillance and prevention of nosocomial infections must be implemented in order to reduce the rate of hospital acquired infections.
TI  - Comparative efficacy evaluation of disinfectants routinely used in hospital practice: India.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare practically achieved disinfection efficacy of some locally available disinfectants on surfaces and infectious microbiological hospital waste. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven disinfectants were tested at concentrations recommended by manufacturers on rough and smooth surfaces that were contaminated experimentally by locally circulating isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, standard isolate of Salmonella typhi and Candida albicans. Reduction in microbial counts before and after surface disinfection was expressed as log reduction. A very heavy microbial waste load was simulated by immersing culture plates with heavy microbial growth in disinfectants. Daily, a sample of disinfectant was taken and subjected to in-use test. RESULTS: The highest average log reduction of test microbes on the rough surface was given by DesNet (5.05) and Bacillocid special (5.02). A comparable average log reduction of test microbes on a smooth steel surface was noted (5.68, 5.67, 5.50) for Lysol, Bacillocid sp. and DesNet, respectively. In the discard jars, Bacillocid special worked satisfactorily for 4 days, DesNet for 3 days and Hi-giene Germitol for 1 day. The remainder of the disinfectants failed in the in-use test on Day 1. Phenolics, although widely used in our settings, may not be as good surface disinfectants as newer formulations like DesNet and Bacillocid special. CONCLUSIONS: Newer quaternary ammonium compounds and aldehyde formulations were found to be the best disinfectants for disinfection of heavy contamination.
TI  - Verification of monoplex and multiplex linear-after-the-exponential PCR gene-specific sepsis assays using clinical isolates.
AB  - AIMS: To verify monoplex and multiplex gene-specific linear-after-the-exponential polymerase chain reaction (LATE-PCR) assays for identifying 17 microbial pathogens (i.e., Klebsiella sp., Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, coagulase negative staphylococci, Enterococcus sp., Candida sp.) commonly associated with septicaemia using clinical isolates. METHODS AND RESULTS: Clinical isolates of each target pathogen were collected from the University of California, Davis Medical Center (UCDMC) microbiology laboratory. Five microlitres (mul) of each culture suspension (1 x 10(8) CFU ml(-1) ) were added to 20 mul of monoplex mastermix. DNA extracted from clinical isolates was tested in multiplex. Monoplex assays demonstrated 100% sensitivity at this input level, except Enterobacter cloacae (2.7%), Ac. baumannii (57%) and Ps. aeruginosa (97.8%). All clinical isolates were positive in multiplex, with the exception of two Ac. baumannii, two Klebsiella oxytoca and two Candida parapsilosis isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Sixteen pathogens can be identified by monoplex LATE-PCR assays with sensitivities >/= 97.8%. The multiplex assay demonstrated 91.4% sensitivity when tested with DNA extracted from 70 different target strains. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study demonstrates the potential of LATE-PCR to serve as an adjunct to culture if the reagents are optimized for sensitivity. Results warrant further testing through analytical and clinical validation of the multiplex assay.
TI  - Microbiological profile of orbital abscess.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the culture and sensitivity pattern is necessary, for the institution of appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy in orbital abscess. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to describe culture and sensitivity patterns of specimens from the orbit and surrounding structures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospectively the medical records of 56 cases of orbital abscess were reviewed. RESULTS: Cultures were positive in 38/56 (68.8%) orbital specimens and the organisms included Staphylococcus aureus 18, Streptococci 7, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 3, 2 each of Enterobactersp, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter sp. and 1 each of Actinomyces israelii, Diptheroids, Coagulase negative Staphylococcus, Citrobacter freundii, Methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Four had polymicrobial infection. Culture of purulent nasal discharge, swabs taken from foci of infection on the face, and blood cultures were done in 26/56, and positive cultures were obtained in 16/26 (61.5%) specimens. In 12 patients, there was a concurrence in the organism cultured from the orbit and from cultures from other sites. Gram-negative organisms were associated with increased ocular morbidity. CONCLUSION: Gram-positive cocci, especially S. aureus are the most common organisms isolated from orbital abscesses. Infections by Gram-negative organisms were associated with more complications. Empirical intravenous antibiotic therapy should have a broad spectrum of activity effective against a wide range of Staphylococcal organisms and Gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - Spectrum and drug resistance of pathogens from patients with burns.
AB  - Microbial infection is an obstacle of burn treatment. However, little is known on what types of microbial infection dominate in the burn center and how the dynamic change of those microorganisms occurs during the past several years in China. We conducted a retrospective study of nosocomial infection (NI) in a large burn center to analyze the spectrum and antimicrobial resistance of microbial isolates from January 2003 to December 2010. We studied 989 isolates from 677 patients who had signs and symptoms of infection 48h after admission. The number of NIs per 100 admissions was 10.9. The commonest isolates were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (23.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (18.7%), and Candida (11.4%). The result indicated that the numbers of patients with Acinetobacter sp. infection increased (P=0.004), but with Proteus mirabilis infection decreased (P=0.004). The isolated Acinetobacter sp. and P. aeruginosa were consistently highly resistant to almost all antibiotics tested. Notably, more frequent Acinetobacter sp. isolates appeared to be resistant to amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, ceftazidim, piperacillin, tazobactam, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin and more frequent Escherichia coli isolates were resistant to ceftazidime and aztreonam at the late time period although the P. aeruginosa and E. coli isolates were sensitive to less used ciprofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam. The increased rates of drug-resistant isolates in the later period might be associated with regular prophylactic therapy with antibiotics.
TI  - Isolation of a bacteriocin-producing lactococcus lactis and application of its bacteriocin to manage spoilage bacteria in high-value marine fish under different storage temperatures.
AB  - The bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria have considerable potential for biopreservation. The Lactococcus lactis strain PSY2 (GenBank account no. JF703669) isolated from the surface of marine perch Perca flavescens produced antibacterial activity against pathogenic and spoilage-causing Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria viz. Arthrobacter sp., Acinetobacter sp., Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus and possessed broad inhibitory spectrum. The biopreservative efficacy of the bacteriocin PSY2 was evaluated using fillets of reef cod, Epinephelus diacanthus. The fillets (10 g) were sprayed with 2.0 ml of 1,600 AU/ml bacteriocin, wrapped and kept under different storage temperatures viz., 4, 0 and -18 degrees C. The biopreservative extended the shelf-life of fillets stored at 4 degrees C to >21 days as against <14 days observed in the untreated samples. The total count of spoilage bacteria was reduced by 2.5 logarithmic units in the treated sample during the 14th day of storage as against the control. Chemical analysis revealed a significant change (P < 0.05) in the pH value, free fatty acid (as % oleic acid), total volatile base nitrogen and total methyl amine content in the treated samples. The overall acceptability in terms of sensory attributes was significantly higher in the bacteriocin-treated samples stored for 21 days at 4 degrees C while the untreated samples became unacceptable by the 14th day. The biopreservative gave no significant effect at -18 degrees C. Thus, the bacteriocin derived from L. lactis PSY2 gave increased protection against spoilage bacteria and offers an alternative for the preservation of high-value sea foods.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Terminalia arjuna Wight & Arn.: an ethnomedicinal plant against pathogens causing ear infection.
AB  - Ear infection is one of the common diseases occurring throughout the world. Different etiological agents are responsible for ear infections. AIM: To assess the antimicrobial potential of Terminalia arjuna leaves and bark extracts against Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, Escherchia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans, pathogens causing ear infections and their comparison with locally available ear drops. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Methanol, ethanol, acetone, aqueous (hot and cold) extracts from the leaves and bark of T. arjuna were tested for their antimicrobial activity. RESULTS: Of the three organic solvents evaluated, acetonic leaf extract was found to be best against S. aureus. Organic bark extract showed almost equal inhibition of all tested Gram negative bacteria except P. aeruginosa. However, aqueous extract of T. arjuna bark exhibited good activity against S. aureus. All the extracts were unable to exhibit any antifungal activity. CONCLUSION: Organic extract obtained from the T. arjuna bark and leaves may be used to treat the bacterial ear pathogens especially S. aureus, which has shown greater inhibition zones than the herbal drops, however, we still need more detailed studies as in vivo testing and pharmacokinetics properties for their therapeutic utility in treating ear infections.
TI  - Anti-bacterial studies on Hemigraphis colorata (Blume) H.G. Hallier and Elephantopus scaber L.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the ethanol, aqueous, chloroform, benzene, acetone and petroleum ether extracts of, Hemigraphis colorata (H. colorata) leaves and stem and Elephantopus scaber (E. scaber) leaves, root and flower for the presence of phyto-constituents and screened the anti-bacterial activity against the selected pathogens. METHODS: The fresh materials were shade dried and powdered using the tissue blender. The dried and powered materials (50 g) were extracted successively with 200 mL of aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether by using Soxhlet extractor for 8 h at a temperature not exceeding the boiling point of the solvent. Aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts were prepared from powdered materials were used for preliminary phytochemical and antimicrobial studies using standard methods. RESULTS: The crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts E. scaber leaves, flower and root and H. colorata leaves and stem demonstrated that out of (5x6x12 = 360) tests for the presence or absence of the above compounds, 188 tests gave positive results and the remaining 172 gave negative results. The results of the phytochemical screening revealed that phenol (12/12), carbohydrates (9/12), steroids (8/12), saponins and coumarins (7/12), tannins (6/12), proteins (5/12), carboxylic acid and flavonoids (4/12), xanthoproteins (3/12) and alkaloids (2/12) presence in the crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts of H. colorata leaves and stem. The crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts E. scaber leaves, flower and root displayed the presence of phenol (18/18), tannin (17/18), carbohydrates (16/18), steroids (14/18), carboxylic acid and coumarins (12/18), saponins (10/18), xanthoprotein (9/18), flavonoids (7/18), protein (4/18) and alkaloids (2/18). The root ethanolic extracts of E. scaber illustrated the highest zone of inhibition against three pathogens viz., Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) (24 mm), Escherichia coli (E. coli) (16 mm) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) (13 mm). The chlorofrom extracts of E. scaber showed the highest zone of inhibition against Bacillus cereus (B. cereus) (12 mm), The leaves ethanolic extracts of E. scaber demonstrated the highest zone of inhibition against three pathogens viz., Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) (18 mm), Proteus mirabilis (P. mirabilis) (17 mm), Salmonella Typhi (S. typhi) (14 mm) and Enterobacter sp. (11 mm) While the benzene extracts of H. colorata demonstrated maximum zone of inhibition against the pathogen Acinetobacter sp. (14 mm) and S. aureus (12 mm). CONCLUSIONS: It is hoped that this study would direct to the establishment of some compounds that could be used to invent new and more potent antimicrobial drugs of natural origin.
TI  - The antimicrobial efficacy of silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds.
AB  - The antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a major concern to wound care because of their ability to resist many of the antibiotics used today to treat infections. Consequently, other antimicrobials, in particular ionic silver, are considered ideal topical agents for effectively helping to manage and prevent local infections. Little is known about the antimicrobial efficacy of ionic silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria at different pH values. Consequently, in this study our aim was to evaluate the effect of pH on the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate (SA) and a silver carboxymethyl cellulose (SCMC) dressing on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn patients. Forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa, MDR Vibrio sp, MDR Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, extended-spectrum ss-lactamase (ESBL) producing Salmonella sp, ESBL producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, ESBL producing Proteus mirabilis, ESBL producing Escherichia coli and MDR Acinetobacter baumannii, routinely isolated from burn wounds were used in the study and evaluated for their susceptibility to two silver containing wound dressings using a standardised antimicrobial efficacy screening assay [corrected zone of inhibition (CZOI)]. The mean overall CZOI for the Gram-positive isolates at a pH of 5.5 were very similar for both dressings. A mean CZOI of 5 mm was recorded for the SCMC dressing, which was slightly higher, at 5.4 mm for the SA dressing. At a pH of 7.0 both dressings, in general, showed a similar activity. However, at a pH of 8.5 the mean CZOI of the SCMC dressing was found to be significantly (P < 0.05) higher than the SA dressing for a select number of isolates. The mean overall CZOI for the Gram-negative bacteria followed a similar pattern as observed with the Gram-positive bacteria. Susceptibility to silver ions did vary significantly between genera and species of bacteria. Interestingly, when pH was changed from 8.5 to 5.5 antimicrobial activity for both dressings in general increased significantly (P < 0.05). Overall, all forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds showed susceptibility to the antimicrobial activity of both silver containing wound dressings over all pH ranges. In addition, the study showed that the performance of both dressings apparently increased when pH became more acidic. The findings in this study may help to further enhance our knowledge of the role pH plays in affecting both bacterial susceptibility and antimicrobial activity of silver containing wound dressings.
TI  - Phytochemical constituents and antibacterial efficacy of the flowers of Peltophorum pterocarpum (DC.) Baker ex Heyne.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the preliminary phytochemistry and antibacterial activity of the flower extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum . METHODS: Phytochemical analysis was done by using the standard methods given by Harbone. The methanolic flower extract were tested against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhi, Serratia marsecens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes by the agar disc diffusion method. RESULTS: Preliminary phytochemical screening of flower extract showed the presence of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, saponins, steroids, tannins, xanthoproteins, carboxylic acids, coumarins and carbohydrates. The flower extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum showed significant activity against four gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes) and three gram negative bacteria (Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter baumannii and Serratia marsecens), out of 12 pathogenic bacteria studied. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study confirm the presence of significant antibacterial activity against human pathogens in the flowers of Peltophorum pterocarpum.
TI  - [Urinary tract infection in patient after brain injury].
AB  - INTRUDUCTION: One of the most important problems in treating patients after head  injury is urinary complication. The first place take urinary infections, which disturb rehabilitation process. Clean intermittent catherization, bladder training and good care do not preserve infection. The purpose of our study was to present the frequency of urinary infections and main pathogens involved in these infections among patients treated in The Department of Rehabilitation after head injury. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We gathered microbiological tests and observations from 398 patients (from 2 to 73 years old) after head injury treated in years 2003-2005. Some of them survived head injury and some of them had also multiorgan injury. RESULTS: In 133 of them we found bladder and urethra infections, vesical calculus in 11 cases. In one case we found prostatic abscessus and in one case urethroscrotal fistula. Each patient had microbiological test of urine after he was admitted to the Department. If the test was positive he had pharmacological treatment. In 157 urinary infections we selected Proteus sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Enterococcus sp., Acinetobacter sp. Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae and Candida albicans was represented not so often. CONCLUSIONS: The most frequent pathogens were: Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E. coli. Most of patients had positive microbiological tests at the admittance to our Department. These complications extend the rehabilitation process and generate high costs. It is necessary to create standards of care of neuropathic bladder in patients after head injury.
TI  - Microbial isolation and emergence of antimicrobial resistance associated with tigecycline usage.
AB  - BACKGROUND: With the increasing experience of tigecycline usage, its ecological impact on microorganisms raises concerns but remains unknown. We aimed to analyze the difference in microorganisms isolated before, during, and after tigecycline usage and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. METHODS: Between July 2008 and August 2009, 66 patients who received tigecycline monotherapy for more than 2 days at a Taiwan medical center were enrolled. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by broth microdilution method with VITEK-2 system and was analyzed according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines, except for tigecycline. We followed USA Food and Drug Administration criteria for interpretation of susceptibility to tigecycline. RESULTS: The median duration of tigecycline monotherapy was 13.4 days. After tigecycline treatment, the isolation frequency of Acinetobacter baumannii, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae decreased, but that of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus sp, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia did not change. A baumannii and P aeruginosa were the two most common pathogens when tigecycline was administered. The tigecycline susceptibility rate of A baumannii isolates decreased after the administration of tigecycline. CONCLUSION: The most common pathogens isolated in patients receiving tigecycline were A baumannii and P aeruginosa. Tigecycline usage decreased the isolation frequency of A baumannii, methicillin-resistant S aureus, E coli, and K pneumoniae. Exposure to tigecycline may be associated with a decreased susceptibility rate of A baumannii for tigecycline.
TI  - Antibiotic activity of tigecycline against clinical pathogens by the micro dilution method.
AB  - Resistant pathogens are the cause of clinical infections which threatening the patients lives and challenging the health systems through their economic importance. Therefore, new antibacterial agents with a broader spectrum of activity that protect against development of resistance are required. Tigecycline (Tygacil, Wyeth) is a relatively new FDA and EMEA approved glycylcycline antimicrobial with an expanded broad-spectrum activity against pathogens involved in complicated skin and skin structure infections. In this study we evaluated the in vitro activity of tigecycline in comparison to 14 other antibiotics against 182 clinical pathogens by use of the micro dilution method. In overall, tigecycline exhibited the lowest Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values in almost all bacteria with a mean of 0.52 +/- 1.25mg/L, followed by meropenem and levofloxacin (mean MIC values 1.29 +/- 2.52 and 1.45 +/- 3.078 mg/L, respectively). MIC50 and MIC90 values of tigecycline were: 0.06 and 0.15 mg/L for E. coli, 0.12 and 1.00 mg/L for Klebsiella sp., 0.12 and 0.85 mg/L for various Enterobacter sp., 1.00 and 8.00 mg/L for Pseudomonas sp., 0.25 and 1.00 mg/L for Acinetobacter sp., 0.06 and 0.12 mg/L for Serratia sp., 0.12 and 0.25mg/L for Staphylococcus aureus, 0.5 and 5.00 mg/L for Streptococcus sp. The MIC values recorded were among the lowest in recent literature for Acinetobacter sp. (included A. baumannii), and comparable to those obtained for Klebsiella, Serratia and Enterobacter indicating that tigecycline has a promising in vitro activity.
TI  - Nosocomial bloodstream infections in Brazilian hospitals: analysis of 2,563 cases from a prospective nationwide surveillance study.
AB  - Nosocomial bloodstream infections (nBSIs) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Data from a nationwide, concurrent surveillance study, Brazilian SCOPE (Surveillance and Control of Pathogens of Epidemiological Importance), were used to examine the epidemiology and microbiology of nBSIs at 16 Brazilian hospitals. In our study 2,563 patients with nBSIs were included from 12 June 2007 to 31 March 2010. Ninety-five percent of BSIs were monomicrobial. Gram-negative organisms caused 58.5% of these BSIs, Gram-positive organisms caused 35.4%, and fungi caused 6.1%. The most common pathogens (monomicrobial) were Staphylococcus aureus (14.0%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (12.6%), Klebsiella spp. (12.0%), and Acinetobacter spp. (11.4%). The crude mortality was 40.0%. Forty-nine percent of nBSIs occurred in the intensive-care unit (ICU). The most frequent underlying conditions were malignancy, in 622 patients (24.3%). Among the potential factors predisposing patients to BSI, central venous catheters were the most frequent (70.3%). Methicillin resistance was detected in 157 S. aureus isolates (43.7%). Of the Klebsiella sp. isolates, 54.9% were resistant to third-generation cephalosporins. Of the Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, 55.9% and 36.8%, respectively, were resistant to imipenem. In our multicenter study, we found high crude mortality and a high proportion of nBSIs due to antibiotic-resistant organisms.
TI  - Contamination of anesthesia circuits by pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Evaluation of contamination of anesthesia circuits by  collecting 56 culture samples from the circular system; previously reprocessed tracheas by disinfection with 1% hypochlorite or 2% glutaraldehyde after being washed in non-sterile water and soap and dried by using compressed air and stored in surgical grade paper; and from other places of the non-reprocessed respiratory circuit, before anesthetic procedures. METHODS: Samples from the inspiratory and expiratory branches of the tracheas, canister, soda-lime, and collector jar (drain) through swab in Stuart medium and streaked in Agar blood, Mac Conkey, and Sabouraud growth media. RESULTS: The level of contamination with fungus and bacteria in the inspiratory and expiratory branches of tracheas reached up to 39.3% in some sites; in some cases, more than one microorganism was present, 75% fungal and 25% bacterial contamination. Cultures were positive for Candida sp., Dermatophytus sp., Penicillium sp., Aspergillus sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Contamination was observed in 25% of the canisters with growth of Candida sp., Penicillium sp., Dermatophytus sp., Aspergillus sp., and Fusarium sp. In the collector jar, a contamination rate of 36% was observed with growth of Candida sp., Dermatophytus sp., S. saprophyticus and Acinetobacter baumannii. Microorganisms did not grow in soda-lime cultures. CONCLUSIONS: In all sites investigated except for soda-lime growth of microorganisms was observed with the possibility of cross infection.
TI  - Identification of Streptomyces sp. KH29, which produces an antibiotic substance processing an inhibitory activity against multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - The Actinomycete strain KH29 is antagonistic to the multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Based on the diaminopimelic acid (DAP) type, and the morphological and physiological characteristics observed through the use of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), KH29 was confirmed as belonging to the genus Streptomyces. By way of its noted 16S rDNA nucleotide sequences, KH29 was found to have a relationship with Streptomyces cinnamonensis. The production of an antibiotic from this strain was found to be most favorable when cultured with glucose, polypeptone, and yeast extract (PY) medium for 6 days at 27 degrees C. The antibiotic produced was identified, through comparisons with reported spectral data including MS and NMR as a cyclo(L-tryptophanyl-L-tryptophanyl). Cyclo(L-Trp-L-Trp), from the PY cultures of KH29, was seen to be highly effective against 41 of 49 multidrugresistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Furthermore, cyclo(LTrp- L-Trp) had antimicrobial activity against Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Aspergillus niger, and Candida albicans, However, it was ineffective against Streptomyces murinus.
TI  - The effect of age on the bacteria isolated and the antibiotic-sensitivity pattern in infections among cancer patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with cancer are predisposed to infections. Antimicrobial patterns and antibiotic sensitivity change with increasing age, making choice of empirical therapy more complicated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This single-center study aims to try and assess the influence of age on microbiology and antibiotic sensitivity of organisms causing infection in patients with malignant disease. RESULTS: The five most common bacterial pathogens isolated were Pseudomonas sp (245, 26.2%) > Enterocococcus sp (109, 11.66%) > Staphylococcus aureus (107, 11.44%) > Escherichia coli (106, 11.34%) > Klebsiella sp (99, 10.59%). There was no significant change in the distribution of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with age. However, there was an increase in the occurrence of the Enterobacteriacea group and a decrease in infections caused by nonlactose fermenters with increasing age. The ESBL production increased from 10.52% (12-19 years) to 24.88% (> 50 years) as did oxacillin resistance (from 14.3% to 28.1%) among S. aureus isolates. The activity of most antimicrobial agents decreased with increasing age. The decreasing trend of activity was statistically significant for meropenam (73.3-41.2%) against Pseudomonas sp. and for the activity of the aminoglycosides for Acinetobacter sp (61.1-17.4% for amikacin). CONCLUSIONS: This suggests that empirical antibiotic therapy needs to be changed on the basis of the age of the patient. It also appears that combination therapy is essential for the empirical treatment of infections in elderly patients with cancer.
TI  - Nosocomial infections and multidrug-resistant bacterial organisms in the pediatric intensive care unit.
AB  - Nosocomial infections in Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs) caused by multidrug-resistant bacterial organisms are increasing. This review attempts to report on significant findings in the current literature related to nosocomial infections in PICU settings with an international perspective. The types of nosocomial infections are addressed, including catheter-related bloodstream infections, ventilator-associated pneumonia, urinary tract infections, gastrointestinal infections and post-surgical wound infections. A review of emerging resistant bacterial pathogens includes methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus sp., Clostridium difficile, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Gram-negative organisms, Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing strains and multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Basic and enhanced infection control methods for the management and control of multidrug-resistant organisms are also summarized with an emphasis on prevention.
TI  - Prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria at a tertiary-care teaching hospital in Mexico: special focus on Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - Our aim was to determine the prevalence of multidrug resistance of Acinetobacter  baumannii and other pathogens at a tertiary-care teaching hospital in Mexico over a 3-year period. Clinical isolates of A. baumannii (n = 550), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 250), some Enterobacteriaceae species (n = 500) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 250) collected over a 3-year period were included. Susceptibility tests were performed by the broth microdilution method. 74% of A. baumannii, 40% of Escherichia coli, 34% of P. aeruginosa, 22% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 9% of Enterobacter cloacae, and 7% of Serratia sp. were multidrug resistant. 59% of A. baumannii clinical isolates were meropenem-resistant. A. baumannii isolates from the lower respiratory tract were the most susceptible, followed by urine clinical isolates. Species from Enterobacteriaceae showed susceptibility rates higher than 90% to meropenem and tigecycline and Serratia sp. showed the highest susceptibility to the drugs evaluated. For P. aeruginosa, the most potent drug was levofloxacin, followed by meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam. With regard to S. aureus, 96% of the isolates were susceptible to vancomycin, followed by tigecycline and minocycline (91% of strains susceptible). The high multidrug resistance observed underscores the need for surveillance of bacterial drug resistance.
TI  - Isolation, structure determination and antibacterial activities of succinamide conjugate diacid from Acinetobacter sp. BJ-L.
AB  - Strain BJ-L was isolated from the a water sample taken from Xiao Yue River in Beijing and identified as Acinetobacter sp. BJ-L based on the study of its morphology, physiology, biochemistry and 16S rRNA gene sequence. A new antimicrobial substance was produced after the strain was incubated in potato extract medium at 15 degrees C for 72 h. The antimicrobial substance was sequentially purified by reduced pressure condensation, EtOAc extract, and silica gel column chromatography. The structure of the antimicrobial substance was elucidated as succinamide conjugate diacid (SCD) by spectroscopic data interpretation. Structure analysis indicated that SCD is a novel compound and that it could inhibit the growth of some tested bacterial strains with the MIC of 2mg/ml, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter aerogenes and Escherichia coli. Moreover, no obvious toxicity has been found on cultured HUVEC cells with different concentrations of SCD at 5, 10, 15, and 20mg/ml.
TI  - Bacteremia among Jordanian children at Princess Rahmah Hospital: Pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate microorganisms causing bacteremia in Jordanian children and to assess their sensitivity to various groups of antimicrobials. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on positive blood cultures taken from 378 children aged below 15 year, who sought medical attention at Princess Rahmah Hospital between January and December/2008. RESULTS: Out of 4475 tested blood samples, 378 isolates were recovered from blood cultures. The male to female isolate ratio was (1.26:1.0). The most frequent pathogen found was Staphylococcus aureus (86.2%), followed by Klebsiella spp. (9%), Escherichia coli (1.9%), Streptococcus spp. (1.9%), Pseudomonas spp. (0.8%), and Acinetobacter sp. was found in only one culture (0.3%). The susceptibility rate of S. aureus was recorded the highest (99.6%) for vancomycin, and the lowest susceptibility rate (3.2%) was recorded for aztreonam. CONCLUSIONS: Staphylococcus aureus was the main isolate in bacteremic children, with all isolates demonstrating susceptibility to vancomycin. Overall, aztreonam resistance was near 97%, and this rate was not affected by sex and blood isolate type. This information should be considered when empirical therapy is recommended or prescribed for children with bacteremia.
TI  - Selection of Streptomyces isolates from Turkish karstic caves against antibiotic  resistant microorganisms.
AB  - In this work, actinomycetes isolates were isolated from rock wall and speleothem  surfaces and soil samples of 19 karstic caves in Turkey. Out of 290 isolates isolated, 180 isolates (62%) exhibited antimicrobial activity against a panel of four bacteria, two yeasts and four filamentous fungi in the screening program. One of them, Streptomyces sp. 1492, was examined for antibiotic production in batch culture. The maximum of antimicrobial activity was shown at 5th day. Antimicrobial activity of the extracted active compound was recorded as dose dependent bacteriostatic or bactericidal against antibiotic resistant clinical bacteria strains; methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin resistant Enterobacter faecium (VRE), and Acinetobacter baumanii. Minimum inhibitor concentration and minimum bactericidal concentrations were determined as lower than standard antibiotic streptomycin; 125 microg/ml and 250-1000 microg/ml, respectively. Active component was found as heat-stable.
TI  - The in-vitro antimicrobial activity of some medicinal plants against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In effort to identify novel bacterial agents, this study was initiated to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of 17 crude extracts from 12 medicinal plants against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria. METHODOLOGY: The antimicrobial activities of plant extracts were evaluated against clinically proved beta-lactam-resistant bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus sp.) and reference strains of bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC 35218, Enterobacter aerogenes ATCC 29751, E. aerogenes ATCC 13048, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Enterococcus hirae ATCC 9790) by using disc-diffusion and agar-dilution assays. RESULTS: The crude plant extracts demonstrated broad spectrum activity against all bacteria tested with inhibition zones in the range of 8-30 mm. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of different plant extracts against the tested bacteria were found to range from <or= 0.3 to >or= 10 mg ml(-1). The most active plant extracts were from Dortenia picta and Bridelia micrantha (MIC: 1.25-10 mg ml(-1)) on beta-lactam-resistant Gram-negative bacilli and the extracts from B. micrantha, Mallotus oppositifolius, Garcinia lucida, Garcinia. kola, Campylospermum densiflorum (leaves) and C. zenkeri (root) on beta-lactam-resistant Gram-positive cocci (MIC: <or= 0.3-5 mg ml(-1)). CONCLUSION: Of the 17 plant extracts studied, seven showed good antimicrobial activity against the tested bacteria. The stem bark of B. micrantha and the leaves of D. picta were most active towards beta-lactamase producing Gram-negative bacilli. This study shows that medicinal plants could be sources of compounds which can be used to fight against beta-lactam resistant bacteria.
TI  - [Etiology of surgical site infections at the orthopaedic trauma units].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to analyze the epidemiological and microbiological analysis of surgical site infections in the orthopedic wards. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 6-month prospective cohort study was conducted at the major teaching hospital in Belgrade. Patient's basic demographic data and data about surgical site infections were collected. Bacteria cultured from the surgical site were also analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 277 patients operated in the Institute of Orthopedics and trauma surgery, Clinical Center of Serbia. Sixty-three cases of SSI were detected, and the overall incidence rate was 22.7% (95% IP = 17.8-27.6). Fifty-three (84.1%) SSIs had microbiological confirmation and overall 82 bacterial strains were isolated. The most frequent isolated bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter sp, Klebsiella pp, Pseudomonas sp and Enterococcus sp. Nineteen (79.2%) strains of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from infected surgical sites were meticillin- resistant. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that it is necessary to maintain continuous surveillance of surgical site infections. It is important to emphasize the need for implementation the measures of contact isolation in order to prevent the nosocomial transmission of resistant bacteria.
TI  - A novel isoquinoline alkaloid, DD-carboxypeptidase inhibitor, with antibacterial  activity isolated from Streptomyces sp. 8812. Part I: Taxonomy, fermentation, isolation and biological activities.
AB  - A novel isoquinoline alkaloid of molecular formula C10H9NO4, labeled JS-1, was isolated from the culture broth of Streptomyces sp. 8812. It was purified by acetone protein precipitation from the culture supernatant, followed by anion exchange and C18 RP HPLC columns. JS-1 is an inhibitor of exocellular DD-carboxypeptidases/transpeptidases (DD-peptidases) 64-575 II from Saccharopolyspora erythraea 64-575 II, and R39 from Actinomadura R39. JS-1 exhibits activity against Gram-negative bacteria, such as Bordetella bronchiseptica, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis, Burkholderia cepacia and Acinetobacter baumanii, with MIC values 10-160 microg ml(-1), and against Gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, with MIC values 40-206 microg ml(-1).
TI  - Eradication of bacteria in suspension and biofilms using methylene blue-loaded dynamic nanoplatforms.
AB  - The bacterial killing efficiency of a dynamic nanoplatform (DNP) was evaluated. The polyacrylamide (PAA) hydrogel matrix of the DNP was loaded with methylene blue (MB) and was previously applied successfully to killing rat C6 glioma tumor cells in culture. This series of experiments is aimed at determining the suitability of this nanoplatform for elimination of bacterial infections. Suspended cultures of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter sp. were exposed to activated ( approximately 650-nm laser light) MB-PAA-DNPs. The killing efficiency of nanoparticle mass concentration, light irradiance and fluence, and dark incubation time was determined on each of the bacterial species. Moreover, the ability of activated MB-PAA-DNPs to inhibit biofilm growth and eradicate and disperse preformed biofilms, preformed on glass and polystyrene surfaces, was demonstrated. The data revealed that activated MB-PAA-DNPs eradicated all species of bacteria examined. Also, encapsulation of MB into the PAA-DNP matrix significantly diminished the observed dark toxicity of free dye. The photobactericidal efficacy of MB-PAA-DNP was found to be higher for gram-positive bacteria than for gram-negative bacteria. In addition, activated MB-PAA-DNP can inhibit biofilm growth and eradicate almost all of the early-age biofilms that are formed by all of the bacteria examined.
TI  - Changes in bacterial isolates from burn wounds and their antibiograms: a 20-year  study (1986-2005).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our aim is to elucidate shifts in the bacterial spectrum colonising burn wounds and corresponding antibiotic susceptibilities during a 20-year study period. METHODS: Microbiological results from burn patients collected between 1986 and 2005 were analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus was isolated most frequently (20.8%), followed by Escherichia coli (13.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.8%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) (10.9%), Enterococcus sp. (9.7%), Enterobacter cloacae (5.6%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5%), Acinetobacter sp. (3.2%), Proteus mirabilis (2%) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (1.4%). Susceptibility of S. aureus to broad-spectrum substances such as ciprofloxacin or penicillinase-stable penicillins has waned, others such as cotrimoxazole or netilmicin remained effective. Not a single resistance against vancomycin was recorded. Increases in methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) were pronounced (3% in 1986-1997 (the first of the three study periods) to 16% in 1998-2001 and 13% in 2002-2005). Results for methicillin-resistant CNS (MRCNS) show an even greater increase. P. aeruginosa has shown increasing susceptibility against netilmicin (1986-1989: 84%, 2002-2005: 95%). Susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to ceftazidime has decreased markedly. S. maltophilia has shown clinically relevant susceptibility mainly against ciprofloxacin. Acinetobacter sp. have shown little susceptibility to most antibiotics. Imipenem or meropenem have been very reliable reserve antibiotics throughout the study period for the fermenting Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae and P. mirabilis), with susceptibilities of or near 100%. CONCLUSION: In-depth knowledge of the bacteria causing infectious complications and of their antibiotic susceptibilities is a prerequisite for treating burn patients. Our study shows shifts in the microbial spectrum and their antibiogram, which mandate frequent reassessments.
TI  - [Respiratory tract fluid microbiology in an intensive care unit].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: to know patterns of antimicrobial resistance of bacterial isolates from tracheal aspirates in an Intensive Care Unit and to evaluate the cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia. METHODS: antibiotic sensitivity test was done. A comparison was made between patients with nosocomial pneumonia reported by infection surveillance team against those reported by the attending physician with the infectious disease consultant. RESULTS: Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the bacteria most frequently reported with 134 isolates (26 %), 71 were multiple-drug-resistant; followed by Staphylococcus with 122 isolates (24 %), of which 88 were S. aureus with 62 of them (70 %) methicillin-resistant. Enterobacteriaceae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, S. marcescens, as well as Acinetobacter sp. and S. maltophilia were occasionally isolated. Candida represented 17 % of the isolates. Three peaks of isolates of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa were identified during the two years of surveillance. There were differences in cases of ventilator associated pneumonia reported by the hospital based epidemiology team and the attending clinicians in collaboration with an Infectious disease consultant. CONCLUSIONS: prevalence of multiple-drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (53 %) and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus (70 %) isolated from the airway is high in our Intensive Care Unit. Enterobacterias, Acinetobacter sp. and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia colonization are low in our Intensive Care Unit.
TI  - [Investigation of microbial colonization of computer keyboards used inside and outside hospital environments].
AB  - Computers have been commonly used in daily life and at hospitals by medical staff. This study was carried out to search the microbial colonization of computer keyboards and mice used inside and outside hospital environments. Keyboards and mice samples from a total of 398 computers were included to the study, in which 38 were used by doctors and nurses in the hospital clinics (Group 1); 32 by the medical faculty students (Group 2), and 328 by university students (Group 3) in the computer laboratories of Selcuk University, Konya (located at middle Anatolia). Of the computers, 96.7% (n:385) have been found to be colonized by coagulase-negative staphylococci (CONS), 13.1% (n:52) by gram-positive spore-forming bacilli and 8.8% (n:35) by corynebacteria; followed by Candida spp. (4.2%), gram-negative bacilli (1.7%) [Acinetobacter spp. (n:4), Pseudomonas sp. (n:l), Klebsiella sp. (n:l), E. coli (n:1)], Staphylococcus aureus (1.5%), and molds (Penicillium, Aspergillus; 1.2%). The isolation rates of CoNS were similar between the groups (94,7%, 93.7%, and 97.2%, respectively). However it was noted that all of the gram-negative bacterial isolates (7/38; 18.4%) were from the samples collected from hospital computers (Group 1). Susceptibility rates of CoNS isolates to cefoxitin were detected as 26.2% in Group 1, 79.2% in Group 2, and 91.3% in Group 3. Five out of six S. aureus strains were found susceptible to cefoxitin, except one isolated from a sample of Group 1. Linezolid resistance in both CoNS and S. aureus isolates were not determined in any groups. As a result, according to the data obtained from this study as well as from the other foreign studies, the computer keyboards and mice which are widely used in the hospital settings, are being the source of potential cross contamination in the development of nosocomial infections. Therefore the computers should be cleaned properly frequently and hand washing procedures and disinfection rules should be obeyed after the use of computers before handling the patients.
TI  - The current state of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli in North America.
AB  - Although much of today's media focuses on multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, resistance within gram-negative bacilli continues to rise, occasionally creating situations in which few or no antibiotics that retain activity are available. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella sp are emerging threats nationally. Although carbapenems are considered the antibiotic class of choice to treat ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, the ability of these organisms to produce carbapenemases has now become apparent in some regions throughout the United States. Although still rare, Klebsiella sp that produce KPC-2 retain susceptibility only to tigecycline, polymyxins, and occasionally aminoglycosides. Multidrug resistance among Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter sp has always been apparent across many hospitals in the United States. Recent surveillance indicates increasing resistance to all currently available antibiotics, including carbapenems, cephalosporins, penicillins, fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides. Against many strains, only polymyxins retain activity; however, resistance has also been reported to these agents. Fortunately, resistance mechanisms such as metallo-beta-lactamases are still rare in the United States. As no new antibiotics with novel mechanisms against many of these gram-negative bacilli are expected to be developed in the foreseeable future, careful and conservative use of agents combined with good infection control practices is required.
TI  - [Initial use of tigecycline in Argentina].
AB  - Tigecycline is a new class of antibiotics active against emerging nosocomial pathogens as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, extended spectrum (3-lactamases-producing enterobacteria and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter sp. It was approved for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections and complicated skin and skin structure infections, but its pharmacological and microbiological profile is attractive to physicians for using it in other pathologies caused by resistant pathogens. The aim of this study was to evaluate in which indications tigecycline was used in Argentinian usual clinical settings during the first months after its launch. We analyzed tigecycline prescriptions in 69 patients with severe infections in 15 institutions. Fifteen patients (21%) received tigecycline for approved indications, and 54 (79%) for off label indications (56%) with scientific support and 23%> with limited or without any scientific support). The most frequent off label use was ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) (36 patients). The etiology of the infections was established in 61%> of the patients. In all cases the isolated bacteria were multi-drug resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter s/?.-carbapenems included. Our study shows that the off label use of tigecycline is frequent, specially in VAP. One of the reasons could be that for MDR-Acinetobacter sp. -VAP, there are few therapeutic options (for instance: colistin). Physicians must evaluate the benefits/risks to use this antibiotic for indications that lack rigorous scientific support.
TI  - Copper(II) complexes with ligands derived from 4-amino-2,3-dimethyl-1-phenyl-3-pyrazolin-5-one: synthesis and biological activity.
AB  - The synthesis of Cu(II) complexes derived from Schiff base ligands obtained by the condensation of 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde or terephtalic aldehyde with 4-amino-antipyrine (4-amino-2,3-dimethyl-1-phenyl-3-pyrazolin-5-one) is presented. The newly prepared compounds were characterized by( 1)H-NMR, UV-VIS, IR and ESR spectroscopy. The determination of the antimicrobial activity of the ligands and of the complexes was carried out on samples of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter boumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida sp. The qualitative and quantitative antimicrobial activity test results proved that all the prepared complexes are very active, especially against samples of Ps. aeruginosa, A. Boumanii, E. coli and S. aureus.
TI  - Five-year review of infections in a burn intensive care unit: High incidence of Acinetobacter baumannii in a tropical climate.
AB  - A 5-year review of nosocomial infections, bacteraemia and wound colonization in patients admitted to a burn intensive care unit from June 2001 to May 2006 was carried out. All patients required intubation at some point, and ICU support. Data on bacterial and fungal isolates were entered prospectively into a hospital-wide computerized database. Nosocomial infections (NIs) were defined using standard CDC criteria. Seventy-six patients were admitted during the study period, with 57 qualifying for analysis. Forty-two patients (74%) developed 137 NIs, with 240 NIs/100 admissions. The most common NI was pneumonia (43%), followed by burn wound infection (34%), primary bloodstream infection (20%) and urinary tract infection (3%). The device specific rate of pneumonia was 143 infections per 1000 ventilator days. There were 113 episodes of bacteraemia and 173 episodes of wound colonization without infection. The most common organisms causing nosocomial infections were Acinetobacter sp. (n=33), followed by methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (n=24) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=22). A. baumannii isolates were highly multiresistant, with 82 distinct strains isolated from 47 patients (82% of patients). Data from this and other studies supports the hypothesis that A. baumannii is more common in tropical, warm climes necessitating vigorous infection control measures to optimise patient outcome.
TI  - Nosocomial pneumonia in a pediatric intensive care unit.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nosocomial pneumonia (NP) is the second most common hospital acquired infection. Understanding the pattern of occurrence, risk factors and etiological agents of NP in a PICU, is essential for developing effective infection control measures. This prospective observational study was conducted in a PICU of a tertiary care teaching hospital, to determine the incidence, etiology and risk factors for NP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients admitted to the PICU, over a period of 1 year who had endotracheal (ET) intubation, were enrolled consecutively into the study. Demographic details were recorded at the time of inclusion. Diagnosis of NP was based on CDC criteria (1988). Semiquantiative assay of endotracheal aspirate (ETA) with a colony count of > 10(5) cfu/mL was taken as evidence of infection. Colonisation was defined as isolation of organism with <10(5) cfu/mL. Age, nutritional status, number and duration of intubations, duration of mechanical ventilation, sedation, nasogastric feeding were the risk factors studied for development of NP. Intubation attempts of more than one were defined as reintubation. Risk factors found significant on univariate analysis, were subjected to multiple regression analysis to determine the most important predictors of NP. RESULTS: The study group comprised of 72 children with a median age of 3.7 years and boys: girls ratio of 1.9:1. Twenty two of 72 (30.5%) developed NP; the predominant isolates from ETA were Acinetobacter anitratus(12), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), Klebsiella sp(3) and Staphylococcus aureus and E.coli(1) each. Additionally 18(39%) had evidence of ET colonization, with Acinetobacter sp being the commonest 9(50%). Re-intubation, prolonged duration of intubation and mechanical ventilation were the significant risk factors on univariate analysis for development of NP. On multiple regression analysis, reintubation was the only independent risk factor for NP(OR 0.72, 95%CI 0.55-0.94). Overall mortality was 21%(15/72);7(47%)of these deaths were secondary to NP. CONCLUSIONS: NP developed in nearly one third of the intubated patients; Gram negative organisms were the predominant etiological agents and associated with high mortality. Re-intubation, prolonged duration of intubation and mechanical ventilation were the significant risk factors on univariate analysis for development of NP. On multiple regression analysis, reintubation was the only independent risk factor for NP.
TI  - [Etiology of ventilator-associated pneumonia in a university hospital. Association with comorbidity, previous use of antibiotics and mortality].
AB  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a complication with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Inadequate antibiotic treatment is a risk factor of mortality which can be improved. For this reason it is important to know the local etiology of VAP. During a one year-period we investigated the etiology of VAP in a teaching hospital. Forty eight VAP were included, of which 19 were women. The median age was 59.5 (range 17-91 years), twelve VAP were early onset. Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was the main microorganism isolated, regardless of timing of diagnosis of VAP, followed by polimicrobial etiology, Acinetobacter sp and P. aeruginosa. Etiology was not associated with comorbidity; however previous antibiotic use was related with MRSA and polymicrobial etiology. Mortality was 35% and was mainly associated with P. aeruginosa isolation. CONCLUSION: MRSA was the main cause of VAP regardless of the timing of its occurrence.
TI  - Cystic fibrosis in adults.
AB  - The aim of this cross-sectional retrospective study was to describe clinical and  functional characteristics and the microbiological profile of an adult population with cystic fibrosis. The study was performed at the Pulmonary Diseases Service of the Hospital of the Medical School of the State University of Campinas. The charts of 54 adults (27 males, 27 females) with cystic fibrosis were reviewed. Demographic, clinical, and microbiological data were collected. Clinical and functional characteristics of patients with chronic Pseudomonas infection were compared with those without it. The mean age of the patients was 41.8 years and the mean sweat chloride concentration was 106.4 mEq/L. Forty-nine percent had chronic respiratory symptoms only after 18 years of age, and 85% reported chronic production of purulent sputum. Six percent had diarrhea or fat in stools, and no patient suffered from diabetes mellitus. Pseudomonas was present in 48%, and 73% of them had the mucoid strain. Others agents found were Staphylococcus aureus (28%), Hemophylus sp. (34%), Aspergillus sp. (22%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (9%), Acinetobacter sp. (7%), and Burkholderia cepacia (2%). Nontuberculous mycobacteria were found in sputum from 9 patients (11%); 34 patients (67%) had obstructive ventilatory defect; and 47% had obstruction and restriction. Concerning the groups with and without Pseudomonas colonization, only the values of sweat chloride were significantly higher in chronic colonized patients. Less severe phenotypes of cystic fibrosis may be found among patients previously diagnosed as having bronchiectasis. Chronic colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this study was not associated with worse clinical status but colonized patients did show significantly higher levels of chloride in sweat.
TI  - [Ventilator associated pneumonia: confection of a strategy of prophylaxis and management based on the analysis of epidemiology].
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Variable magnitude of impact on the outcomes of the critically ill patients has been credited to ventilation-associated pneumonia, in terms of mortality, length of hospital stay and mechanic ventilation days. Three objectives have been defined in this study: mortality and incidence of ventilation-associated pneumonia before and after the implantation of a prophylaxis protocol (primary objectives); microbiologic mapping (secondary objective) as an instrument to optimize therapy. METHODS: A historical cohort was followed during the period of August 2001 to January 2004, fragmented in two segments, pre (until January 2003, n = 52) and post-implantation of the mentioned protocol, the analysis of mortality and microbiologic mapping been performed in the second segment (control group n = 39 and case group n = 14). RESULTS: The incidence rates from 2001 to 2003 were respectively 28.05 +/- 12.92, 22.45 +/- 10.18 and 10.75 +/- 7.61. The decrease in this rate after the intervention did not reach statistical significance (p > 0.4). Mortality rates were 49% in the control group (CI 95 = 33% to 65%) and 43% in the case group (CI 95 = 14% to 72%), OR = 0.88 (CI 95 = 0.26 to 2.94), without statistical significance either (p = 0.65). Eight bronco-alveolar lavage were obtained (57%), 50% with multiple flora. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated in six patients (75%), Acinetobacter sp in one case (12.5 %) and methicilin-resistent Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in one (12.5%). Other Gram negative bacilli producers of extended spectrum betalactamase (ESBL) were isolated in two cases (25%) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in another (12.5%). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence rate of ventilation-associated pneumonia revealed a tendency to considerable reduction after the utilization of the prophylaxis protocol, while the results suggest no impact on mortality rates. Further prospective evaluation of a greater sample is required, in order to get to definite conclusions regarding prognosis. The isolated germs were, in its majority, high risk pathogens to multiresistance to antibiotics, pointing the necessity of knowledge of local susceptibility profile, so that an adequate initial therapeutic strategy can be undertaken.
TI  - Bacterial survival in evaporating deposited droplets on a teflon-coated surface.
AB  - Understanding of bacterial survival in aerosols is crucial for controlling infection transmission via airborne aerosols and/or large droplets routes. The cell viability changes of four bacteria species (Escherichia coli K12 JM109; Acinetobacter sp. 5A5; Pseudomonas oleovorans X5; and Staphylococcus aureus X8), three Gram-negative and one Gram-positive, in a large evaporating droplet of size 1,800 microm in diameter on teflon-coated slides were measured using the LIVE/DEAD BacLight solution and a microscope. Droplets of three levels of salinity (0, 0.9, and 36% w/v) were tested. All four species survived well during the droplet evaporation process, but died mostly at the time when droplets were dried out at 40-45 min. The final bacteria survival rate after droplets were completely dried was dependent on bacteria species and the salinity of the suspension solution. Droplet evaporation over the first 35-40 min had no adverse effect on bacterial survival for the droplets tested. The lethal effect of desiccation was found to be the most important death mechanism.
TI  - Nature of bacteria found on some wards in Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Oman.
AB  - This study aims to determine what objects lying in the hospital environment or brought in from outside contribute to the introduction of bacteria associated with nosocomial infections. One hundred swab specimens collected from children's toys, sinks, door handles, telephone handsets and flowers brought into the hospital were plated on different culture media. Colonial growth on the media was purified and identified subsequently using standard bacteriological methods. Of the 100 samples cultured, 61 (61%) grew a range of bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=14, 23.0%), Acinetobacter spp. (n=13, 21.3%), Serratia spp. (n=9, 14.7%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=9, 14.7%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n=4, 6.6%), Staphylococcus aureus (n=4, 6.6%), Enterobacter cloacae (n=3, 4.9%), Pantoea sp. (n=2, 3.3%), Chryseobacterium sp. (n=2, 3.3%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=1, 1.6%). Although all the Serratia, Enterobacter, Klebsiella and Pantoea species isolates showed varying degrees of resistance to gentamicin, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime and cefotaxime, all were resistant to ampicillin. Chryseobacterium and Stenotrophomonas species isolates were resistant to amikacin, imipenem, gentamicin and ceftazidime, to which only three isolates of Pseudomonas species were resistant. All the staphylococcal isolates were susceptible to methicillin. Although there has been no major outbreak of a nosocomial infection in the hospital, it is strongly recommended that effective control measures (e.g., sampling the hospital water supply, disinfecting children's toys, use of appropriate hand washing and checking some of the disinfectants for presence of bacteria) are needed. These measures are necessary to ensure that the antibiotic-resistant strains identified in this study are not allowed to spread in the hospital.
TI  - [Susceptibility of the hospital environmental bacterial strains to a detergent and disinfectant product for surfaces].
AB  - We studied the sensitivity of the hospital environmental bacterial strains to Surfanios, which is a detergent and disinfectant product for surfaces. This product is used in our establishment since nearly 10 years. This work which relates to 425 bacterial strains proposes to study the possible evolution of the resistance of the bacteria under the pressure of a product biocide used since many years without the change of active ingredient as recommended in pharmaceutical and agroalimentary industry. We developed a micromethod to study the sensitivity of many bacterial strains simultaneously into a 96 wells microplaque. All the Staphylococcus aureus strains (N = 20) and Staphylococcus with coagulase negative (N = 308) as 78 Acinetobacter sp. strains remain very sensitive to Surfanios according to our study. Target dilution, which is the last dilution not allowing the bacterial growth, is much lower than the manufacturer recommended use dilution. For the Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains tested, target dilution is equal or higher than the dilution of use. Rather than to propose the rotation or the alternation of the products, we recommend the use of Surfanios for the bionettoyage of dry surfaces which might be contaminated by Staphylococcus sp. or Acinetobacter sp. and the use of another product or Surfanios at a higher concentration, active on Pseudomonas sp. to disinfect wet surfaces which are possible reservoirs for the opportunist bacteria of the hydrous flora.
TI  - Culture-proven bacterial keratitis in a Malaysian general hospital.
AB  - One hundred patients (101 eyes) with culture-proven bacterial keratitis were treated in the Department of Ophthalmology, Hospital Sultanah Aminah, Johor Bahru, over a 4-year period. The majority of patients was male (63%), Malay (60%), from the Johor Bahru district (62%) and aged between 41 to 50 years (20%). The ocular predisposing factors were ocular trauma (41 eyes), ocular surface disease (28 eyes) and contact lens wear (26 eyes). The corneal ulcers were mainly large (50.5%), central (59.4%) and colonized by Gram-negative bacteria (78.1%). The most frequently isolated microorganisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (67 eyes), Staphylococcus aureus (12 eyes), Acinetobacter baumanii (6 eyes), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5 eyes), Corynebacterium sp. (3 eyes:) and Streptococcus pneumonliae (3 eyes). Twelve eyes (11.8%) had polymicrobial infection. A good visual outcome occurred in 52.5% of eyes analysed. Prognostic factors for visual outcome include presenting Snellen visual acuity, time to presentation after onset of ocular symptoms, ocular predisposing factor, corneal ulcer location and corneal ulcer size.
TI  - Characterization of a 3944 Da bacteriocin, produced by Enterococcus mundtii ST15, with activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Strain ST15, isolated from soy beans, and identified as Enterococcus mundtii, produces a 3944 Da bacteriocin that inhibits the growth of Lactobacillus sakei, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Propionibacterium sp., Clostridium tyrobutyricum, Acinetobacter baumanii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus caprinus. Bacteriocin ST15 is inactivated by proteinase K, pronase, pepsin, protease and Triton X-114, but not when treated with catalase, alpha-amylase, Triton X-100, SDS, Tween 20, Tween 80, urea and EDTA. No change in activity was recorded after 2 h at pH values between 2.0 and 12.0, and after treatment at 100 degrees C for 90 min. Activity was, however, lost after treatment at 121 degrees C for 20 min. The mode of activity is bactericidal. The highest level of activity (51200 AU ml(-1)) was recorded when cells were grown in MRS broth, pH 6.5. Bacteriocin ST15 differs from other broad-spectrum bacteriocins described for Enterococcus spp. by being active against Gram-negative bacteria and by being smaller.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of Phrygilanthus acutifolius.
AB  - Ethanol extract of flowers of Phrygilanthus acutifolius (Ruiz & Pav.) Eichler (Loranthaceae) inhibited the growth of both Gram (+) bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Enterococcus faecalis) and Gram (-) bacteria (Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter sp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). This extract was bactericidal against Staphylococcus aureus and bacteriostatic against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Morphological evidence suggests that the extract causes the swelling of the bacterial body of Staphylococcus aureus, the disintegration of the cell surface and the cell death. Bactericidal activity was optimal at pH 7.5 and was not affected by different ionic strengths. The presence of Mg2+ in the culture medium of Phrygilanthus acutifolius diminished the sensitivity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain against the extract. Test results would tend to corroborate the folk belief that the flowers of this plant are efficacious against respiratory infections and would justify its further investigation.
TI  - [Sequential microbiological monitoring of tracheal aspirates in intubated patients admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate, sequentially, tracheal aspirates from patients admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit and to associate these pathogens with length of hospital stay, previous use of antimicrobial therapy and diagnoses of ventilator-associated pneumonia. METHODS: The study population consisted of patients admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit, between November 2002 and December 2003, on ventilator support. Three tracheal aspirates were collected serially from each patient. The first tracheal aspirate sample was obtained 6 hours after admission to the intensive care unit and the remaining samples were collected after 48 and 96 hours. RESULTS: One hundred patients aged from one day to 14 years were assessed. Positive tracheal cultures were observed to have increased in the three tracheal aspirate samples collected from each patient for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, from 6 to 22% (p = 0.002), and to have decreased for Staphylococcus aureus, from 23 to 8% (p = 0.009). Isolation of Candida spp increased for the subset that had received previous antimicrobial therapy (p < 0.05). Sixteen (23.5%) out of 68 patients admitted without pneumonia developed ventilator-associated pneumonia. Positive tracheal aspirate cultures were obtained in 10 out of 16 of these patients: six were positive for Staphylococcus aureus (three associated with Acinetobacter baumanii), two for Klebsiella spp (one associated with Enterobacter spp), one for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and one for Candida spp. CONCLUSION: Sequential evaluation of tracheal aspirates may be useful to track changes in bacterial flora at pediatric intensive care units.
TI  - [Comparison of BACTEC and BacT/ALERT systems in evaluation of blood cultures].
AB  - Automatized blood culture systems are used widely due to the characteristics such as lower contamination risks, shorter incubation periods and higher isolation rates. In this study, BACTEC 9050 (Becton Dickinson, Ireland) and BacT/ALERT 120 (Organon Teknika Corp, USA) systems were compared for the evaluation of blood cultures obtained from 222 hospitalized patients in intensive care units between September and December 2003. For this purpose, two blood samples obtained from each arms of patients, were inoculated into BACTEC plus aerobic/F (Becton Dickinson, Ireland) and BacT/ALERT FA/aerobic (BioMerieux, USA) media, respectively, and incubated. The first bacterial growth time has been recorded for each system and the bacteria were identified by conventional methods. As a result, both of the systems detected bacterial growth in 42 (91.3%) of a total of 46 (20.7%) positive blood samples obtained from 222 patients. The distribution of microorganisms grown in BACTEC and BacT/ALERT were found as follows, respectively; 24 and 20 coagulase negative staphylococci, 8 and 8 Acinetobacter sp., 6 and 10 Escherichia coli, 1 and 1 Staphylococcus aureus, 1 and 1 Pseudomonas sp., 1 and 1 Klebsiella sp., 1 and 1 Candida sp. False positivity and false negativity were not observed in either of the systems. Positive results were obtained in an average time of 20.6 (7.5-35.5) hours and 22.49 (1.5-35.5) hours with BACTEC and BacT/ALERT, respectively. Since there was no statistically significant difference between the systems concerning bacterial isolation rates and periods (p=1.00), it may be concluded that both of these systems would be used in clinical microbiology laboratories for the evaluation of blood cultures.
TI  - New antibiotic agents: problems and prospects.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgical site infections are the third most common healthcare-associated infection, often leading to prolonged hospital stay and excessive expenditures. Management of these infections has become more challenging due to rising rates of multi-drug-resistant organisms and few new antibiotic options. METHODS: This paper reviews the literature, summarizes the epidemiology of surgical site infections and the threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and provides an insight into new treatment options for this condition. RESULTS: Patients with surgical site infections are at greater risk of acquiring healthcare-associated antibiotic-resistant pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) sp., and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-(ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Multi-drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacteroides fragilis are also a growing problem. Several useful drugs have recently become available for the management of serious, gram-positive infections (e.g., daptomycin, linezolid, telithromycin). Tigecycline, the first-in-class glycylcycline, has broad-spectrum in vitro activity, including against MRSA, VRE, resistant enteric gram-negative bacilli (e.g., Acinetobacter sp.), "atypical" pathogens, and anaerobes. Phase 3 clinical trials suggest that tigecycline will be an excellent option for antibiotic monotherapy for complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSSI) and intra-abdominal infections. Oritavancin and dalbavacin, two novel glycopeptide antibiotics that are also in late-stage clinical development, appear that they, too, will be useful for cSSSI due to resistant, gram-positive bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: Multi-drug-resistant pathogens are threatening the success of available antibiotic therapy. Many new options are useful for infections due to multi-drug-resistant, gram-positive bacteria. Tigecycline is a promising new agent that provides coverage against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative, aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic strains, including resistant isolates, and may make broad-spectrum, single-agent therapy possible.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance among nosocomial isolates in a Croatian intensive care unit--results of a twelve-year focal surveillance of nosocomial infections.
AB  - Continuous 12-year (1990--2001) focal surveillance of the antibiotic resistance among the most common nosocomial pathogens (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter sp., and Staphylococcus aureus) in 1325 Intensive Care Unit patients was performed. The surveillance period was divided in three 4-year time intervals (1990--1993, 1994--1997 and 1998--2001) and the prevalence of resistance was compared between intervals. Specimens included blood, urine and respiratory tract specimens. The incidence and trends of resistance to six antibiotics showed inconsistent results. Aminoglycoside resistance decreased among K. pneumoniae_isolates (gentamicin 83%, 72.7% and 49.6%; amikacin 50.9%, 51.5% and 18.2%) and Acinetobacter sp. strains (amikacin 77%, 63.4% and 58.2%) but increased in P. aeruginosa (amikacin 27.5%, 63.3% and 44.1%). Overall, resistance to ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, and imipenem increased but imipenem resistance is still low, particularly among Acinetobacter sp. isolates (0, 2.1% and 1.5%). However, imipenem resistance increased among P. aeruginosa (10.2%, 31.6%, 22.1%). The prevalence of methicillin resistance was high but did not change during the surveillance period (82.3%, 78.3% and 82.2%). The present study suggests a complex picture of the development of antibiotic resistance in a single ICU. Significant changes occur over time but they are unpredictable and do not show identical tendencies for different species and antibiotics.
TI  - Monitoring of antibiotic resistance in bacterial isolates from bacteremic patients.
AB  - The aim of the study was to monitor the prevalence of pathogens and development of resistance in bacteria isolated from bacteremic patients. Five University Clinics and/or Regional Hospitals in the Slovak Republic participated in the study and a total of 421 isolates were collected in the second half of the year 2002. The most prevalent organisms were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CONS) (19%), Staphylococcus aureus (18.3%), among Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli (13.3%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.4%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.8%) followed by enterococci, Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterobacter sp. All CONS and S. aureus were susceptible to vancomycin; resistance to oxacillin was observed for 55% of the CONS and only for 4% of S. aureus isolates. A higher prevalence of resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin, gentamicin and ofloxacin was found in CONS in comparison to S. aureus. Enterococcus sp. isolates were fully susceptible to vancomycin and teicoplanin. Gentamicin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, third generation cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin showed good activity against E. coli. Although 17% of K. pneumoniae isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin, it was the most effective drug against K. pneumoniae; the prevalence of resistance to other antibiotics was rather higher. Gentamicin and ciprofloxacin were the most active against Enterobacter sp. isolates and ceftazidime and meropenem against P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Temporary catheter infections in hemodialysis patients: results from a single center in Turkey.
AB  - In this study, we aimed to determine the frequencies of catheter exit-site infection (CESI), catheter-related bloodstream infection (CR-BSI) and catheter colonization (CC); causative microorganisms; and resistance patterns in patients with temporary hemodialysis catheters. From March 1999 to March 2000, 67 hemodialysis patients (38 males, 29 females; median age: 52, range: 17-84) were evaluated. The CDC criteria were used to diagnose CESI, CR-BSI and CC. The tips of catheters were cultured by Maki's method. At the same time, two different blood cultures, one from peripheral vein and the other through the catheter lumen were drawn. Swab cultures from the catheter exit sites were also performed. The isolation and identification of bacteria were performed by conventional methods and the susceptibility testing by the Kirby-Bauer method. CESI, CR-BSI and CC were found in, respectively, 20 (29.8%), 16 (23.8%) and 11 (16.4%) patients. The etiologic agents in CR-BSI were as follows: Staphylococcus aureus (5), coagulase-negative staphylococci (2), Enterococcus sp. (1), Escherichia coli (1), Acinetobacter sp. (1) and Proteus sp. (1). Methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci and methicillin-resistant S. aureus were found in proportions of 45.5% and 63.6% in CESI and CR-BSI+CC. The only risk factor for the development of CR-BSI and CC was intravenous drug use. In our center, the majority of CESI, CR-BSI and CC were due to staphylococci and there was a high rate of methicillin resistance.
TI  - Sepsis in burned patients.
AB  - A prospective study was conducted from June 2001 to May 2002 at the Burns Unit of Hospital Regional da Asa Norte, Brasilia, Brazil. During the period of the study, 252 patients were treated at the Burns Unit, 49 (19.4%) developed clinically and microbiologically proven sepsis. Twenty-six (53.1%) were males and 23 (46.9%) females with a mean age of 22 years (range one to 89 years) and mean burned body surface area of 37.7 +/- 18.4% (range 7 to 84%). Forty-three patients had flame burns, five a scald and one an electric burn. These 49 patients had a total of 62 septic episodes. Forty (81.6%) patients had only one and nine (18.4%) had up to three episodes of sepsis. Thirty (61.2%) patients had their first septicemic episode either earlier or by one week postburn. Out of 62 septic episodes, 58 were due to bacteria and four due to Candida sp. The most common bacteria isolated from blood culture were Staphylococccus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Eleven (18.9%) episodes were due to oxacillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Acinetobacter baumannii was sensitive to ampicillin/sulbactam in 71.4% and to imipenem in 85.7% of the cases. The primary foci of sepsis were the burn wound in 15 (24.2%) episodes. The most common clinical findings of sepsis in these patients were fever, dyspnea, hypotension and oliguria. The most common laboratory findings of these patients were anemia, leukocytosis, hypoalbuminemia and thrombocytopenia. Twelve (24.5%) patients died. The appropriate knowledge of clinical, epidemiological, laboratorial and microbiological aspects of sepsis in burned patients permits an adequate diagnosis and treatment of this complication.
TI  - Employment of broad-range 16S rRNA PCR to detect aetiological agents of infection from clinical specimens in patients with acute meningitis--rapid separation of 16S rRNA PCR amplicons without the need for cloning.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to develop a polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) method for the rapid separation of 16S rRNA PCR amplicons from aetiological agents of acute meningitis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Blood samples from 40 patients with suspected acute meningococcal meningitis were examined for the presence of causal agents, including Neisseria meningitidis employing two methods: (i) broad-range 16S rRNA PCR in conjunction with PAGE and automated sequencing and (ii) species-specific PCR employing ABI TaqMan technology for N. meningitidis. Analysis of clinical specimens employing 16S rRNA PCR yielded 33/40 (82.5%) positive for the presence of bacterial DNA. Species-specific PCR yielded 30/40 (75%) clinical specimens positive for N. meningitidis. Prior to separation by PAGE, only 6/33 (18.2%) amplicons were able to be identified by sequence analysis, the remaining amplicons (n=27) did not yield an identification due to the presence of mixed 16S rRNA PCR amplicons. Following separation, amplicons were re-amplified and sequenced, yielding 24/27 (88.9%) positive for N. meningitidis and three specimens positive for Acinetobacter sp., Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. One specimen was positive for both N. meningitidis and Streptococcus spp. and another specimen was positive for N. meningitidis and Pseudomonas sp., by broad-range PCR. Seven clinical specimens were negative for N. meningitidis and other eubacteria using both detection techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical specimens including blood and cerebrospinal fluid from patients with suspected acute bacterial meningitis, may become contaminated with commensal skin flora, resulting in difficulties in downstream sequencing of pathogen plus contaminant DNA. This study allows for the rapid separation of amplified pathogen from contaminant DNA. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: This study demonstrated the usefulness of the rapid separation of multiple 16S rRNA PCR amplicons using a combination of PAGE and automated sequencing, without the need of cloning. Adoption of this technique is therefore proposed when trying to rapidly identify pathogens in clinical specimens employing broad-range 16S rRNA PCR.
TI  - Distribution of mef(A) in gram-positive bacteria from healthy Portuguese children.
AB  - We screened 615 gram-positive isolates from 150 healthy children for the presence of the erm(A), erm(B), erm(C), erm(F), and mef(A) genes. The mef(A) genes were found in 20 (9%) of the macrolide-resistant isolates, including Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp. Sixteen of the 19 gram-positive isolates tested carried the other seven open reading frames (ORFs) described in Tn1207.1, a genetic element carrying mef(A) recently described in Streptococcus pneumoniae. The three Staphylococcus spp. did not carry orf1 to orf3. A gram-negative Acinetobacter junii isolate also carried the other seven ORFs described in Tn1207.1. A Staphylococcus aureus isolate, a Streptococcus intermedius isolate, a Streptococcus sp. isolate, and an Enterococcus sp. isolate had their mef(A) genes completely sequenced and showed 100% identity at the DNA and amino acid levels with the mef(A) gene from S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Pathogen frequency and resistance patterns in Brazilian hospitals: summary of results from three years of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pathogen frequency and resistance patterns may vary significantly from country to country and also in different hospitals within a country. Thus, regional surveillance programs are essential to guide empirical therapy and infection control measures. METHODS: Rank order of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogenic species causing bloodstream infections (BSI), lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), wound or skin and soft tissue infections (WSSTI), and urinary tract infections (UTI) in hospitalized patients were determined by collecting consecutive isolates over a specified period of time, as part of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Program (SENTRY). All isolates were tested by reference broth microdilution. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: A total of 3,728 bacterial strains were obtained from January, 1997, to December, 1999, from 12 Brazilian hospitals located in 4 states. The largest number of isolates were obtained from patients with BSI (2,008), followed by LRTI (822 cases), UTI (468 cases), and WSSTI (430 cases). Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated pathogen in general (22.8% - 852 isolates), followed by E. coli (13.8% - 516 cases) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13.3% - 496 cases). Staphylococcus aureus was also the most common species isolated from BSI (23.6%) and WSSTI (45.8%), and P. aeruginosa was the most frequent species isolated from patients with LRTI (29.4%). The main bacterial resistance problems found in this study were: imipenem resistance among P. aeruginosa (69.8% susceptibility) and Acinetobacter spp. (88.1% susceptibility); ESBL production among K. pneumoniae (48.4%) and E. coli (8.9%); resistance to third generation cephalosporins among Enterobacter spp. (68.1% susceptible to ceftazidime) and oxacillin resistance among S. aureus (34.0%) and coagulase negative staphylococci (80.1%). Only the carbapenems (88.1% to 89.3% susceptibility) showed reasonable activity against the Acinetobacter spp. isolates evaluated.
TI  - Multiple organ failure in septic patients.
AB  - Multiple organ failure (MOF) is the main cause of death in ICUs, especially affecting septic patients. It is strongly related to number of systems with failure, type of system involved, risk factors such as age, previous chronic diseases, delayed or inadequate resuscitation, persistent infection, immune suppression, and others. The prognoses is worse for patients rather than in elective or emergency surgical patients. The objective of this article is to provide data from our university teaching hospital ICU related to the incidence of septic patients, the distribution of MOF, and distribution of failure among each of the organs. The mortality rate, relationship between mortality and age, and mortality and types of organs affected were evaluated. The main bacterial causes of sepsis were also identified. A retrospective evaluation was done of 249 patients admitted to the ICU in a 4 month period during 1999. Fifty four patients had sepsis diagnosed by ACCS/SCCM criteria. There were 37 men and 17 women; 24 medical and 30 post-surgical patients (9 after elective surgery and 21 emergency patients). APACHE II score was calculated on admission and MOF, measured for the first five days, was diagnosed using Marshall and Meakins criteria. The statistical method used was non-parametric Mann-Whitney test, p<0.05 was considered significant. The incidence of sepsis was recorded in 54/249 patients (22%). Thirty of these 54 patients (56%) died. Death occurred in 2 of 11 patients with one organ failure (18%), in 14/27 with 2 or 3 organ failures (52%), and 14/16 with 4 or more organ failures (88%). None of the three patients 15 to 20 years old died, 17/32 (55%) patients age 21-60 years, and >61 years 13/19 (68%), died. There were 23 patients with positive bacterial culture. The most frequent bacteria found were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), multiresistant Acinetobacter baumanii (3), Staphylococcus epidermidis (3), Enterobacter aerogenes (3), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2) and multiresistant Staphylococcus aureus (2). The mean value +/- SD of APACHE II (mortality risk) for survivors was 21 +/- 18 and for non-survivors 42 +/- 26 (p<0.001). We conclude that MOF due to sepsis in an ICU is frequent, with high mortality related to the number of failing organs, age and high APACHE II.
TI  - [Hospital acquired pneumonia--analysis of frequency and etiology in Polish hospitals in 1998].
AB  - Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is one of the most frequently occurring hospital infections in the world. This study describes the incidence of HAP in Poland, as well as the specific risk factors leading to this type of infection in Polish hospitals; including those of patient age, length of hospitalization, and use of mechanical ventilation. The epidemiology of HAP as well as treatment resistance of various causal organisms was studied. Data for this study was acquired from the Registry of Hospital-acquired Infectious Diseases for the year 1998. Out of 329,608 hospital-acquired infections in all patients except newborns, 920 were found to be HAP. This study showed that of every 1000 hospital admissions three patients developed HAP (0.3%). Death occurred in 260 of 920 HAP cases or 30%; and HAP found to be the direct cause of death in 66 of the 260 cases (25%). The greatest incidence of HAP was found to occur in patients older than 75 years, was directly related to the length of hospital stay, and was higher in patients on mechanical ventilation longer than 10 days. The most frequently isolated causal agents were the Gram-negative rods (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter sp., Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp.), and Staphylococcus aureus. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were found in only 2% and 4% of cases, respectively, and thus were the least likely causes of HAP in this population. It was found that the percentage of methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus was very high (55% to 60%); vancomycin-resistant enterococci were only found in patients who did not undergo surgery. The isolated strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed marked resistance to chinolones (58-76%) and to imipen (approximately 20%). In the Enterobacteriaceae family, Klebsiella sp. was found to be resistant to third-generation cephalosporins (56-73%) and Enterobacter sp. resistant in 55% to 81% of the isolates.
TI  - 16S rDNA-based identification of bacteria from conjunctival swabs by PCR and DGGE fingerprinting.
AB  - PURPOSE: Establishment of a new molecular biology technique for the identification of multiple bacteria from the ocular environment, which can be applied supplementarily to cultivation in cases of severe bacterial infections. METHODS: From 60 human conjunctivae (29 with purulent and 31 with nonpurulent conjunctivitis), swabs were taken and DNA was extracted. Fragments of 200 bp, spanning the V3 region of the eubacterial 16S rDNA, were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). For phylogenetic identification, DGGE bands were excised and directly sequenced, or 16S rDNA clone libraries were constructed and clones were screened by DGGE. Sequences were compared with sequences of known bacteria listed in the EMBL database. Furthermore, the results were compared with results obtained from conventional cultivation. RESULTS: 16S rDNA could be amplified from 25 of 29 investigated swabs taken from purulent conjunctivitis eyes and from 2 of 31 investigated swabs taken from nonpurulent conjunctivitis eyes. Sixteen samples showed monomicrobial and 11 samples showed polymicrobial infections. The following genera (n is number of samples) were detected: Staphylococcus (n = 8), Corynebacterium (n = 7), Propionibacterium (n = 7), Streptococcus (n = 6), Bacillus (n = 2), Acinetobacter (n = 3), Pseudomonas (n = 3), Proteus (n = 1), and Brevundimonas (n = 1). Four sequences could not be identified to the genus level. They had highest sequence similarities both to sequences of Pantoea and Enterobacter (n = 1), Kingella and Neisseria (n = 1), Serratia and Aranicola (n = 1), and Leuconostoc and Weissella (n = 2), respectively. Culture was only positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 9), Corynebacteria (n = 3), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), Streptococcus sp. (n = 1), Proteus sp. (n = 1), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1). In total, 45% of the 60 analyzed conjunctival swabs were PCR positive, whereas only 22% were culture positive. No sample positive by culture gave negative results by PCR. CONCLUSIONS: 16S rDNA sequence analyses and DGGE fingerprinting are appropriate methods for the detection and identification of monomicrobial as well as polymicrobial ocular infections of bacteria that might not be detected by conventional cultivation.
TI  - Nosocomial pneumonia: importance of recognition of aetiological agents to define  an appropriate initial empirical therapy.
AB  - Of the 16,024 patients hospitalized from January 1995 to October 1997, 397 (2.4%) acquired nosocomial pneumonia and the aetiological agent was defined in 101 (25%). About 82% developed late onset pneumonia (>7 days of hospitalization). The site of isolation of microorganisms was bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) (49%), blood culture (39%), pleural effusion (10%) and (2%) pulmonary tissue. Gram-negative bacteria were responsible for 54% of infections. Staphylococcus aureus (34%) was the most frequent microorganism isolated followed by Acinetobacter baumannii (29%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae, responsible for 7% of nosocomial pneumonia. Monotherapy gave good cover for early onset pneumonia, but not for late onset pneumonia. Based on our selection criteria, ciprofloxacin was the best monotherapy for early (50%) and late (31%) onset pneumonia. Vancomycin plus ciprofloxacin gave cover of 85% of early and 64% of late onset pneumonia. Monotherapy with ciprofloxacin and also combination therapy of ciprofloxacin plus vancomycin may be good options as initial empirical therapy for nosocomial pneumonia.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of piperacillin/tazobactam in comparison with other broad-spectrum beta-lactams.
AB  - Combining tazobactam, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, with the ureidopenicillin, piperacillin, successfully restores the activity of piperacillin against beta-lactamase producing bacteria. Thus, piperacillin/tazobactam is highly active against most clinically important species of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, including anaerobes. We evaluated the in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam against clinical isolates from a tertiary university hospital located in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Its activity was compared to that of ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, ampicillin/sulbactam, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, aztreonam, and imipenem against 820 isolates (608 Gram-negative and 212 Gram-positive) collected from hospitalized patients in 1999. The most frequent species tested were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (168/20%), Escherichia coli (139/17%), Acinetobacter spp. (131/16%), and Staphylococcus aureus (76/9%). Of the isolates studied, 30% were from the bloodstream, 16% from the lower respiratory tract, and 11% from surgical wounds or soft tissue. The isolates were susceptibility tested by the broth microdilution method according to NCCLS procedures. The isolates tested were highly resistant to most antimicrobial agents evaluated. Imipenem resistance was not verified among Enterobacteriaceae, and piperacillin/tazobactam was the second most active beta-lactams against this group of bacteria (80.0% susceptibility). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production was very high among E. coli (approximately 20%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (approximately 40%). Imipenem was uniformly active against these species (100% susceptibility) and piperacillin/tazobactam was the second most active compound inhibiting 84.4% of isolates. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was highly resistant to all beta-lactams evaluated and piperacillin/tazobactam was the most active compound against this species. Our results demonstrate an extremely high level of antimicrobial resistance in the hospital evaluated, especially among non-enteric Gram-negative bacilli. Due to this high level of resistance, piperacillin/tazobactam represents an important contribution to the treatment of nosocomial infections.
TI  - Incidence and susceptibility of pathogenic bacteria vary between intensive care units within a single hospital: implications for empiric antibiotic strategies.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the incidence of recovery and patterns of antibiotic susceptibility of pathogenic bacteria vary between intensive care units (ICUs) in a single teaching hospital. METHODS: Culture and susceptibility results were collected prospectively for a 3-month period (April through June 1999) in each of the surgical, trauma, and medical ICUs. The number of unique isolates and susceptibility patterns were determined. Susceptibility of isolates among ICUs was compared with chi2. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences between ICUs in susceptibility to various antibiotics were found for Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus sp, Acinetobacter sp, Enterobacter sp, Klebsiella sp, and Pseudomonas sp. Notably, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus was not seen in the medical ICU, whereas it was seen in both the surgical and trauma ICUs. Klebsiella spp resistant to ceftazidime were seen only in the trauma ICU. The aminoglycosides and quinolones had attenuated activity against Pseudomonas sp in the surgical ICU, whereas they remained highly effective in the trauma ICU. Cefazolin had no activity against the Enterobacter sp in either of the surgical ICUs, but was highly effective in the medical ICU. CONCLUSION: Although the microbiologic results of this study should not be extrapolated to other institutions, the principle is of value. There is variability between ICUs in a single large teaching hospital in susceptibility of bacterial pathogens to various antibiotics. This may have implications in the design of empiric antibiotic strategies and the planning of the hospital formulary. Hospital wide or composite ICU antibiograms are inadequate for planning empiric therapy in the ICU.
TI  - Post-caesarean septicaemia in Kandang Kerbau Hospital, Singapore, 1993-1995.
AB  - We reviewed all documented cases of septicaemia following caesarean deliveries in Kandang Kerbau Hospital between 1st January 1993 to 31st December 1995. There were 22 cases of septicaemia among 8201 caesarean births, and hence the incidence is 2.7:1000. There were 45,412 deliveries, and the overall caesarean section rate was 18.1%. Among the 22 documented cases of septicaemia which came under this study, the most common clinical conditions found were endomyometritis (7 cases), urinary tract infection (6 cases), and wound infection (3 cases). One of the three cases with wound infection also had pneumonia. There was one patient who had mild transient myocarditis. We could not determine with certainty any site of infection in five patients. The most common bloodstream bacterial isolates was Staphylococcus aureus (16), while the uncommon ones were Acinetobacter baumanii (2), Escherichia coli (1), Klebsiella sp. (1), Staphylococcus epidermidis (1), Streptococcus Group F (1), Peptostreptococcus species and Veillonella species (1). There was no mortality and prompt, vigorous treatment had led to uneventful recovery in all the cases.
TI  - Effect of oral ciprofloxacin on bacterial flora of perineum, urethra, and lower urinary tract in men with spinal cord injury.
AB  - A study was performed in 25 men with spinal cord injuries undergoing intermittent catheterization whose urine had > or = 10(5) bacterial colonies/ml to determine efficacy of ciprofloxacin in eradicating susceptible organisms from urine, urethra, and perineum. Cultures were obtained prior to, during, and 5 to 7 days after administration of 500 mg twice daily for 10 days. Organisms in urine were also present in the urethra and/or perineum in 20 cases. Susceptible bacteria disappeared from urine in all subjects; but at follow-up 12 had cultures positive for ciprofloxacin-resistant Gram-positive cocci, including 1 with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and 2 with ciprofloxacin-resistant Acinetobacter sp. Treatment significantly reduced Gram-negative bacilli in perinea and urethras, but ciprofloxacin-susceptible organisms were replaced by resistant staphylococci, including MRSA, enterococci, and Acinetobacter sp. We support use of ciprofloxacin for treatment of urinary tract infections in persons with spinal cord injury, but in view of supercolonization with resistant organisms, the drug should be reserved for symptomatic persons not likely to respond to other oral agents.
TI  - [Treatment of pneumonia in hospitalized patients--results of a multicenter study  using a fourth-generation cephalosporin (cefepime)].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate efficacy and safety of cefepime in severe pneumonia of hospitalized patients. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: A prospective, multicenter, open trial was performed with 148 patients (62 patients with nosocomial pneumonia; 34 with community-acquired pneumonia and 52 undefined forms). Cefepime was intravenously administered (1,000 to 2,000 mg every 12 hours), and doses were adjusted for renal function. The efficacy endpoint was clinical response at 48 hours after completion of therapy. RESULTS: The mean age was 56.4 +/- 20.31 years. The most common bacterias isolated from patients with nosocomial pneumonia were: 5 (8.06%) Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 7 (11.29%) Pseudomonas sp.; 6 (9.68%) Klebsiella sp.; 3 (4.84%) E. coli; 2 (3.23%) Acinetobacter baumannii; 3 (4.84%) Staphylococcus aureus; 3 (4.84%) Streptococcus pneumoniae; 5 (8.06%) others. The most common isolates from patients with community-acquired pneumonia were: 2 (5.88%) Streptococcus pneumoniae; 1 (2.94%) S. aureus; 2 (5.88%) P. aeruginosa and 2 (5.88%) K. pneumoniae. Clinical efficacy was demonstrated in 137/148 (92.56%) of the cases since improvement was obtained in 20.27% and healing in 72.29%. Failure of the treatment was observed in 10 patients (6.75%) and one patient the evaluation was not possible. Adverse events were reported for 5/148 patients (3.38%). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that cefepime was safe and effective for treatment of severe pneumonia in hospitalized patients.
TI  - Effects of cytokines and endotoxin on the intracellular growth of bacteria.
AB  - Patients with unresolving acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have persistently elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the lungs and circulation and increased rates of bacterial infections. Phagocytic cells hyperactivated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which induces high levels of proinflammatory cytokines in monocytic cells, are inefficient in killing ingested bacteria despite having intact phagocytic activity. On the other hand, phagocytic cells that are activated with an analogue of LPS that does not induce the expression of proinflammatory cytokines effectively ingest and kill bacteria. We hypothesized that in the presence of high concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines, bacteria may adapt and utilize cytokines to their growth advantage. To test our hypothesis, we primed a human monocytic cell line (U937) with escalating concentrations of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), and IL-6 and with LPS. These cells were then exposed to fresh isolates of three common nosocomial pathogens: Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and an Acinetobacter sp. In human monocytes primed with lower concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines (10 to 250 pg) or LPS (1 and 10 ng), intracellular bacterial growth decreased. However, when human monocytes were primed with higher concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines (1 to 10 ng) or LPS (1 to 10 micrograms), intracellular growth of the tested bacteria increased significantly (P <0.0001). These results were reproduced with peripheral blood monocytes obtained from normal healthy volunteers. The specificity of the cytokine activity was demonstrated by neutralizing the cytokines with specific antibodies. Our findings provide a possible mechanism to explain the frequent development of bacterial infections in patients with an intense and protracted inflammatory response.

AB  - A retrospective survey of non-opportunistic bacterial pathogens isolated from blood cultures of patients with HIV disease has been carried out for a 6-year period, and the antibiotic susceptibility of the 748 microorganisms cultured from 682 consecutive patients, has been evaluated. Gram-positive organisms significantly prevailed over gram-negative ones, with Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, Xantomonas maltophilia, Salmonella and Pseudomonas sp. as the most common isolates, and Rhodococcus equi, Serratia, Acinetobacter and Alcaligenes sp. as emerging pathogens. Useful suggestions may be obtained for empiric antimicrobial treatment of suspected sepsis in HIV-infected patients, from the evaluation of the antibiotic susceptibility profile of these non-opportunistic bacterial pathogens.
TI  - [Study on septicaemia in infants and children in the past 20 years. Part 1. An analysis of causal organisms].
AB  - Causal organisms and their changes were evaluated in 158 cases of septicaemia admitted to Jikei University Hospital from 1975 to 1994. Eighty patients (50.6%) were aged less than 1 year, and 37 patients (23.4%) were newborns. The average mortality rate was 18.4%. The mortality rate between 1975 and 1984 was 26.8%, and that of the past 10 years (from 1985 to 1994) decreased to 13.7%. Staphylococcus aureus (29 cases, 19.4%) was the most common pathogens isolated, followed by Pseudomonas sp. (24 cases, 15.2%), Escherichia coli (19 cases, 12.0%), and Haemophilus influenzae (18 cases, 11.4%). H. influenzae, Acinetobacter sp., Streptococcus pneumoniae and Group B streptococcus (GBS) increased in the past 10 years (from 1985 to 1994), compared with the preceding 10 years (from 1975 to 1984). The mortality rate of Klebsiella sp. septicaemia (28.6%) was highest, followed by Pseudomonas sp. (25.0%), S. aureus (24.1%), S. pneumoniae (22.2%). H. influenzae and Acinetobacter sp. septicaemia were not fatal. E. coli and GBS were common among neonates and patients aged less than 1 year. H. influenzae septicaemia occurred mainly in patients with meningitis, in those younger than school age. Acinetobacter sp. was common among neonates and children with leukaemia Pseudomonas sp., Klebsiella sp., and Acinetobacter sp. were mainly detected in patients with underlying diseases. E. coli, H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae and GBS were mainly detected in patients without underlying diseases.
TI  - Hospital acquired infections in a Singapore Hospital: 1985-1992.
AB  - A prospective survey of hospital-acquired infections (HAI) was conducted from 1985 to 1992. The survey used laboratory results to estimate incidence and alert infection control staff to a need for further action. The results were analysed with regard to the site, speciality and type of organism. The distribution by speciality of patients who had methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections was compared with the distribution of all patients with HAI. Although the surveillance was only partial, the data collected from year to year over the period of study seemed constant. The distribution of infection by type, location and bacterial cause was similar to results from other parts of the world. Notable differences were the high incidence of Acinetobacter sp., and the pattern of antimicrobial susceptibility to commonly used agents. Over half the Staphylococcus aureus isolates were methicillin resistant.
TI  - The danger of infections of the hospitalized patients with the microorganisms present in preparations and in the hospital environment.
AB  - Two strains-S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcus, resistant to antibiotics, were isolated from previously non-opened preparations made by the hospital pharmacy and industrially produced. After application in the surgery ward, two Enterobacter agglomerans strains, resistant to antibiotics were detected in oral mixtures. The resistant bacteria, B. cereus and 4 strains of Ps. aeruginosa, were also found in the purified water. In hospital environment 9 strains of staphylococci, resistant to the tested antibiotics were found. Only one of them was S. aureus (detected on the wall), the others being coagulase-negative staphylococci. Most of them were isolated from the floor, but also from the wall, table and from the air in surgical and ophthalmological wards and in the hospital pharmacy. The most dangerous were three Gram-negative strains resistant to all tested antibiotics. They were isolated from the floor (Enterobacter cloacae), from the wall (Proteus mirabilis) and from the container with oral mixture in infant ward (Ps. malthophilia). Many strains resistant to many antibiotics were detected on the floor of surgical, nephrological and infantile wards as well as from the pharmacies: Enterobacter cloacae (7 strains), Citrobacter freundi, Ps. aeruginosa, Ps. cepacia (2 strains), Ps. maltophilia (2 strains) and Moraxella. Many resistant strains were also present on the walls (E. coli, Ps. mirabilis, Ps. cepacia, Alcaligens, Acinetobacter). The resistant strains were rarely observed on the table, medical equipment and on personnel hands. Klebsiella oxytoca and Ps. paucimobilis were found on the table, Ps. maltophilia on the dropper and on the rim of the container with oral mixture. Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas sp. were isolated from the medicine glass, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas sp. from the personnel hands in the pharmacies.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance problem in a university hospital.
AB  - In a study conducted in 1991 in the National University Hospital, Singapore, the  susceptibilities of a total of 2156 recent clinical isolates were tested against 25 antimicrobial drugs. The organisms were those isolated from routine specimens received in the microbiology laboratory. About 40% Staphylococcus aureus isolations in the hospital were resistant to methicillin. A high incidence of the resistance was noted among Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative staphylococci to antistaphylococcal drugs. Acinetobacter sp. and Klebsiella sp. are becoming major threats with regard to antimicrobial treatment as they are multi-drug resistant. Pseudomonas aeruginosa did not show a resistance problem except to pefloxacin (74%). Ampicillin resistance of Acinetobacter sp. (93%) was reduced to 71% by ampicillin/clavulanic acid and to 7% by ampicillin/sulbactam. With regards to the urinary isolates higher rates of resistance were noticed with Pseudomonas aeruginosa to antipseudomonas drugs and for co-trimoxazole with other Gram negative organisms, compared to non-urinary isolates.
TI  - Childhood bacteremia in Israel: causes, age relation, predisposing factors and source.
AB  - To delineate the spectrum of childhood bacteremia in a tertiary medical center in Israel and to define the historical, clinical and environmental variables that affect it, 339 bacteremic episodes were studied. Ten of the episodes (3%) were polymicrobial and 148 (44%) were hospital acquired. Staphylococcus epidermidis (17%), Staph. aureus (10%), gram-negative bacilli and Haemophilus influenzae (7%) were the most frequent etiologic pathogens. Some organisms (e.g., H. influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae) caused mainly community-acquired bacteremia, while Klebsiella sp., Enterococcus faecalis, and Acinetobacter sp. caused mainly nosocomial bacteremia. Underlying conditions were noted in 72% of the bacteremic children. A source of the bacteremia was identified in 60% of the episodes; the most common was i.v.-line infection. Age, underlying condition, source and location in the hospital markedly affected the profile of microorganisms causing childhood bacteremia. Each of these variables defined 3-5 organisms that were most prominent. In each episode of suspected bacteremia, these variables should be considered, thus defining the most likely causative pathogen(s), which should be covered by appropriate empiric antimicrobial treatment.
TI  - Ampicillin/sulbactam in lower respiratory tract infections: a review.
AB  - The pathophysiology and microbiology of lower respiratory tract infections are outlined and diagnostic and therapeutic problems considered. The use of sulbactam/ampicillin in the treatment of these infections is evaluated. The two drugs have similar pharmacokinetic characteristics; predictable and dose-dependent peak serum concentrations of both agents are achieved after parenteral administration. More than 90% of strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Klebsiella sp, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter sp were inhibited by ampicillin/sulbactam concentrations of 16/8 micrograms/ml. Serum concentrations of ampicillin and sulbactam were 18 to 28 micrograms/ml and 13 micrograms/ml, respectively, after intramuscular administration of 1 gm/0.5 gm of ampicillin/sulbactam and 58 micrograms/ml and 30 micrograms/ml, respectively, after intravenous administration of the same dose. Good distribution of ampicillin/sulbactam into lung tissue, sputum, and bronchial fluid has been demonstrated. In over 2,250 patients treated with ampicillin/sulbactam, the rate of discontinuance of treatment because of side effects was less than 1%. Satisfactory clinical and bacteriologic outcome has been reported in over 80% of patients treated with ampicillin/sulbactam. The cost of ampicillin/sulbactam treatment is generally lower than that of other comparable antibiotic regimens.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the internal medicine].
AB  - Fifty-two patients with moderate or severe infections associated with internal medicine were treated with imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) and the efficacy and the safety of this drug were evaluated. There were 20 patients with pneumonia, 10 with acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections, 9 with sepsis, 2 with pyothorax, 3 with intraabdominal infection, 2 with urinary tract infection, 1 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with infective endocarditis, 4 with fever of unknown origin. Forty-four patients were evaluable for the efficacy. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 12 patients, good in 26, fair in 3 and poor in 3. The overall clinical efficacy was 86.4%. The efficacy rate was 63.6% in patients previously treated and 93.9% in patients previously untreated with other antibiotics. Bacteriologically, Staphylococcus aureus (8 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5), Streptococcus pyogenes (1), other Gram-positive coccus (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8), Haemophilus influenzae (4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), Serratia marcescens (3), Escherichia coli (3), Branhamella catarrhalis (1), Citrobacter freundii (1), Klebsiella oxytoca (1), Enterobacter sp. (1), and Peptostreptococcus sp. (1) were eradicated. P. aeruginosa (3) and Acinetobacter sp. (1) decreased. S. aureus (1), S. epidermidis (1), P. aeruginosa (5), and S. marcescens (1) persisted or appeared. The eradication rate was 83.7%. Six patients showed adverse reactions including general fatigue 1, epigastralgia 1, eruption 1, eosinophilia 1 and elevation of S-GOT 2. But all of the adverse reactions were mild or slight, and transient. These findings indicate that IPM/CS is a useful and safe drug against bacterial infections in internal medicine.
TI  - Community acquired pneumonia: aetiology and prognostic index evaluation.
AB  - A 10 month prospective study of all adults admitted to Waikato Hospital with community acquired pneumonia was performed to assess aetiology, mortality, hospital stay, and the value of a prognostic index based on that obtained from a British Thoracic Society study. The 92 patients in the survey had a mean age of 56 (range 13-97) years. A microbiological diagnosis was established in 72%; Streptococcus pneumoniae (33%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (18%), and influenza A virus (8%) were the most common microorganisms. Other causative organisms were Legionella pneumophila (4 cases), Staphylococcus aureus (3), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2), Haemophilus influenzae (2), Nocardia brasiliensis (1), and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (1). Chlamydia sp, influenza B virus and adenovirus were each found in one case; all were cultured on nasopharygeal aspirates. Aspiration was considered to be the underlying cause in five patients, two with epilepsy and one with pseudobulbar palsy. Five of the six deaths that occurred were in patients over 75 years of age and the other was 69. In four of the six the established causative organisms were Chlamydia sp (1), K pneumoniae (1), and S aureus (2). Patients had a 16 fold increased risk of death if they had two or more of the following on admission: a respiratory rate of 30/minute or more, diastolic blood pressure of 60 mm Hg or less, and either confusion or a plasma urea concentration greater than 7.0 mmol/l.
TI  - [Value of the technique of cellular lysis by thermic shock in the isolation of bacteria causing osteoarticular infections].
AB  - The purpose of this work is to compare, a conventional technique, for bacterial isolation, with a lysis-centrifugation method using a rapid freezing in liquid nitrogen, followed by decongelation at 37 degrees C for bone and joint samples. The bone and joint specimens were biopsies and punctions (35 cases) or fistula (10 cases). The residual antibiotic activity of the sample was determined using a susceptible strain of Micrococcus luteus and of Staphylococcus epidermidis. Among the 45 samples, 20 were sterile with both methods among which 8 exhibited a residual antibiotic activity which may have contributed to isolation failure. In 12 cases, bacterial isolates were obtained with both methods. Cultures were obtained from 13 samples with the lysis centrifugation method alone. The isolates were 4 Staphylococcus aureus, 8 coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and 1 Acinetobacter sp. These results suggest that the intracellular location of bacteria may be responsible for the negative cultures from bone or joint specimens.
TI  - [Therapeutic efficacy of imipenem/cilastatin sodium on respiratory tract infections in lung cancer patients].
AB  - Imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) was used to treat respiratory tract infections (RTI) in 54 patients with lung cancer. Out of the 54 patients studied, 53 were evaluable for the utility of IPM/CS; 42 had pneumonia, 9 had obstructive pneumonia, 1 had a lung abscess and 1 had acute bronchitis. The efficacy rate was 71.7%. Seventeen causative organisms were isolated from 14 patients. They included Staphylococcus aureus 5 strains, Staphylococcus epidermidis 4 strains, Staphylococcus sp. 2 strains, Enterococcus faecalis 1 strain, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 strains, Pseudomonas fluorescens 2 strains, Acinetobacter sp. 1 strain, and the eradication rate was 81.8%. Clinical adverse effects (nausea and vomiting) were observed in 1 patient. Abnormalities in laboratory test results were observed in 3 patients. They disappeared or returned to normal values after completion of therapy or discontinuation of IPM/CS administration. IPM/CS appears to be a useful antibiotic for RTI in patients with lung cancer.
TI  - Prevalence of nosocomial infections in a Saudi Arabian teaching hospital.
AB  - The rate of nosocomial infections was determined during a 9-month study in a 6-year-old hospital in north Saudi Arabia. The overall rate of nosocomial infection in the hospital was 2.2%. The rates in the different services varied. The highest were in the Special Care Baby Unit (13.5%) and Intensive Care Unit (6%). In the other services it ranged from 1 to 3.5%. The common causal agents of documented infections were Escherichia coli (81), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (55), Staphylococcus aureus (43), Klebsiella spp. (23), Candida spp. (15), Proteus spp. (14), enterococci (13), Enterobacter spp. (7), Acinetobacter spp. (2) and Providencia sp. (1). The most commonly infected sites from which these organisms were isolated were urine (133), wounds (48), umbilical cord (18), high vaginal infection (13), blood (11), burn respiratory tract infection (10 each).
TI  - Efficacy of teicoplanin and imipenem on respiratory infections in high risk patients.
AB  - The efficacy of teicoplanin and imipenem was assayed on microorganisms, mainly hospital opportunistic organisms, resistant to common therapy, isolated from bronchoaspirates of high risk hospitalized patients. Imipenem has shown remarkable activity against all isolated microorganisms with sensitivities ranging from 91.93% against Acinetobacter calcoaceticus to 75.86% against Pseudomonas sp. Teicoplanin has shown excellent activity against Staphylococcus aureus (sensitivity 83.66%).
TI  - Lid flora in blepharitis.
AB  - The microbiologic evaluations of 332 consecutive patients with the primary diagnosis of chronic blepharitis were reviewed and compared to those of 160 control patients. The most commonly isolated organisms from lids with blepharitis were Staphylococcus epidermidis (95.8%), Propronibacterium acnes (92.8%), Corynebacterium sp. (76.8%), Acinetobacter sp. (11.4%), and Staphylococcus aureus (10.5%). Compared to controls, S. epidermidis (p less than 0.01), P. acnes (p less than 0.02), and Corynebacterium sp. (p less than 0.001) were present significantly more often. S. aureus and the isolation of more than one microbial species were not more common in blepharitis patients. Quantitatively, heavy growth, by total and individual species, was significantly more common in blepharitis patients (total, p less than 0.001; S. epidermidis, p less than 0.001, P. acnes, p less than 0.001). These data demonstrate that patients with blepharitis are more likely to have normal skin bacteria on their lids and in greater quantities than nonblepharitis patients.
TI  - The effect of physical and microbiological factors on food container leakage.
AB  - The effect of physical and microbiological factors on food container leakage was  investigated in a container leakage model system (CLMS). The leakage of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Staphylococcus sp., Pseudomonas sp., Bacillus sp., a coryneform, Staph. aureus, and two biotest organisms (Enterobacter cloacae NC1B 8151 and Ent. aerogenes MB31) was studied. The rate of bacterial leakage (log10 cells/channel/s) was greater in the presence of a partial vacuum of 51-305 mm Hg than at atmospheric pressure. Fluid flow (ml) through leakage channels was increased by the application of vacuum. Leakage varied with vacuum, bacterial morphology, cell concentration, leakage channel size (0.78-120 micron 2) and channel shape (straight or convoluted). The number of leaked cells was not proportional to vacuum or channel size. The effect of channel shape varied with bacterial species. Increased container medium viscosity decreased bacterial leakage. Fluid flow through leakage channels was generally reduced by the most viscous solution. Cells from biofilms and monolayers of Ac. calcoaceticus or Staph. aureus attached to nylon (Hyfax) or stainless steel surfaces underwent leakage. Mixed bacterial populations had characteristic leakage rates against vacuum different from the leakage pattern of individual species in the population. The composition of the leaked population was different from the original inoculum. The results indicated that container leakage is a complex process involving a range of interdependent factors.
TI  - [Evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the treatment of respiratory tract infections].
AB  - Imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) was administered to 55 patients with respiratory tract infections (RTI). A clinical evaluation of IPM/CS was carried out in 51 patients, 28 with pneumonia, 4 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with pyothorax, 6 with bronchitis, 9 with bronchiectasis, 1 with diffuse panbronchiolitis and 2 with RTI with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and the clinical efficacy rate was 78.4%. Causative organisms were isolated in 23 strains out of 20 patients, such as Staphylococcus aureus 4 strains, Staphylococcus epidermidis 1 strain, Streptococcus pneumoniae 1 strain, Branhamella catarrhalis 1 strain, Haemophilus influenzae 2 strains, Klebsiella pneumoniae 4 strains, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 6 strains, Pseudomonas sp. 1 strain, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus 1 strain, Acinetobacter sp. 1 strain and glucose non-fermentative Gram-negative rod 1 strain. An eradication rate of 70.6% was obtained. An overall eradication rate of main causative organisms in RTI including S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and K. pneumoniae was 75.0%. Clinical adverse effects were observed in 5 patients, and these were eruption in 2, itching in 1, vomiting in 1 and drug fever in 1. Abnormalities in laboratory test results were observed in 8 patients. These disappeared or returned to normal values after completion or discontinuation of IPM/CS administration. IPM/CS appears to be a useful antibiotic for the treatment of RTI, especially severe infections.
TI  - Bacteriological study of extracted IUCDs.
AB  
TI  - Intravenous ciprofloxacin or ceftazidime in selected infections. A prospective, randomized, controlled study.
AB  - In a prospective, randomized, controlled study, the effectiveness and safety of intravenous ciprofloxacin was compared with those of ceftazidime in the treatment of tissue infections. A total of 52 patients received intravenous ciprofloxacin 200 mg twice daily (26 patients) or ceftazidime 1 to 2 g every eight to 12 hours (26 patients). This was followed, respectively, by oral ciprofloxacin or another suitable drug when improvement was seen. Informed consent was obtained from all patients. Cultures and laboratory determinations were performed initially and repeated periodically as indicated. Both groups were comparable in age, sex, number of infected sites, and instance of nosocomial infections (27 total). Severe infections occurred in six ciprofloxacin and 12 ceftazidime patients (p = 0.056). There were 13 patients in the ciprofloxacin group and six in the ceftazidime group with accompanying diseases (p = 0.032). Patients were treated with ciprofloxacin or ceftazidime for infections of the urinary tract (eight and two patients, respectively), skin or soft tissues (15 and 17 patients), pelvis (one and zero patients), lower respiratory tract (one and one patients), intra-abdominal (zero and three patients), and bacteremia (three and five patients). Two patients in each group had two sites of infection. Causative organisms were as follows: 15 gram-positive cocci (90 percent minimal inhibitory concentration: ciprofloxacin, 0.5; ceftazidime, 16.0 micrograms/ml) and 55 gram-negative rods (44 Enterobacteriaceae, nine Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 90 percent minimal inhibitory concentration: ciprofloxacin, 0.25; ceftazidime, 8.0 micrograms/ml). Resistance emerged in one patient treated with ciprofloxacin (Acinetobacter sp.) and 12 treated with ceftazidime (four Enterococcus, two Staphylococcus aureus, six other). Intravenous treatment was longer with ceftazidime (11.5 days versus 5.6 days for the ciprofloxacin group, p less than 0.0005), but the total duration of therapy was similar (12.9 versus 14.1 days, p value not significant). Resolution or improvement occurred in 23 ciprofloxacin and 26 ceftazidime sites of infection (p value not significant). Death occurred in two ceftazidime-treated patients (due to bacterial infection) and one ciprofloxacin-treated patient (at the induction of anesthesia). Adverse experiences were more common in the ceftazidime group as compared with the ciprofloxacin group (22 versus 15 patients, p = 0.026). Ciprofloxacin eradicated 25 of 31 causative organisms, whereas ceftazidime eradicated 30 of 41 (p value not significant). Intravenous ciprofloxacin was at least as effective as ceftazidime. Patients treated with ciprofloxacin may need added coverage for anaerobes, but the drug's excellent activity against nosocomial pathogens and its availability in oral form allow for an early change to oral therapy without compromising effectiveness coupled with added savings and convenience.
TI  - Ciprofloxacin in patients with bacteremic infections. The Spanish Group for the Study of Ciprofloxacin.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of 68 episodes of bacteremia were studied. Patients were treated intravenously (30 cases), orally (13 cases), or with sequential intravenous/oral therapy (25 cases). Intravenous doses ranged from 200 to 400 mg per day and oral doses ranged from 1,000 to 1,500 mg per day. According to the criteria of McCabe and Jackson, 39 cases had nonfatal and 29 had ultimately fatal underlying diseases. The clinical condition of patients at the start of therapy was critical or poor in 40 cases and fair or good in 28. Sixty-four of the 68 episodes of bacteremia were monomicrobial and the remaining four were polymicrobial. The causative micro-organisms were: Escherichia coli (18 episodes), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13 episodes), Acinetobacter sp. (10 episodes), Salmonella sp. (seven episodes), Enterobacter sp. (six episodes), Proteus sp. (four episodes), Serratia sp. (four episodes), Haemophilus influenzae (three episodes), Klebsiella sp. (three episodes), Staphylococcus aureus (2 episodes), and Morganella morganii (two episodes). Overall clinical efficacy of ciprofloxacin was 94 percent (64 of 68 patients). Bacteremia persisted in four patients (failure rate of 6 percent). Five organisms persisted: Acinetobacter sp. (two patients), P. aeruginosa (one patient), Enterobacter sp. (one patient), and Serratia sp. (one patient). Side effects were phlebitis associated with intravenous administration (four cases), dizziness (four cases), and superinfection (six cases). Superinfecting organisms and sites were as follows: Enterococcus faecalis, wound (2 cases); Candida sp., urinary tract infection (one case); Acinetobacter anitratus (ciprofloxacin resistant), urinary tract infection (one case); Staphylococcus epidermidis, blood (one case); and Clostridium perfringens, blood (one case). Ciprofloxacin administered either intravenously, orally, or intravenously followed by the oral route is effective therapy in the treatment of severe bacteremic infections.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - Urinary tract infection.
AB  - Over two years, 9892 mid-stream urine samples from patients attending the Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi were cultured. Significant bacterial growth was seen in 23.5% samples. Further identification of these organisms revealed 40% of E. coli, 16% Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 11% Klebsiella aerogenes, 5.0% Enterobacter sp., 13% Proteus sp., 4.0% Serratia liquifaciens, 1.0% Acinetobacter sp., 3.0% Citrobacter sp., 4.0% Enterococci, 0.5% Staphylococcus aureus. Results of sensitivity tests performed with antibiotics Ampicillin, Cotrimoxazole, Nitrofurantoin, Nalidixic acid, Gentamicin, Amikacin, Pipemedic acid, Cefotaxime, Azactam and Carbenicillin did not reveal any distinct pattern.
TI  - A contribution to the situation of antibiotic resistance in Abeokuta (Ogunstate)  and Minna (Nigerstate) in Nigeria.
AB  - After testing various chemotherapeutics the following conclusions could be drawn: Pseudomonas was sensitive only to gentamicin. Gentamicin, aminopenicilline + calvulanacid and cefoxitin were 100% effective against E. coli. Gentamicin also proved effective against Enterobacter (83%). Cefoxitin, aminopenicillin + clavulanacid, gentamicin and trimethoprim + sulfonamide were effective against Klebsiella. Concerning Proteus sp., cefoxitin showed best results (100%). Acinetobacter was 100% inhibited by gentamicin. Gentamicin was most effective (93% sensitivity) against Staph. aureus. Trimethoprim + sulfonamide and erythromycine showed resistance rate of 17%, cefalosporine and isoxazolylpenicilline a rate of 21%. Aminopenicillin and aminopenicilline + calvulanacid were most suitable against Enterococcus (100%).
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. Focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in Japan between May, 1985 through March, 1986. These tests were organized by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. This paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and Campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (OFLX) and conventional antibacterial drugs. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. OFLX showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, C. freundii, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and C. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to OFLX. Moreover, OFLX has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. When studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, OFLX occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. Almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
TI  - Serum bactericidal activity and postantibiotic effect in serum of patients with urinary tract infection receiving high-dose amikacin.
AB  - Ten patients received a 30-min infusion of amikacin (30 mg/kg) on day 1 and 15 mg/kg on day 2. Mean serum creatinine was 1.1 +/- 0.3 (standard deviation) mg/dl before and 1.0 +/- 0.3 mg/dl 3 days after the second infusion. Mean serum amikacin concentrations before, at the end of infusion, and 1, 6, 12, and 24 h after 30 and 15 mg/kg were 0, 157, 79, 31, 16, 5, 5, 85, 51, 19, 12, and 5 mg/liter, respectively. Five strains each of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis susceptible and resistant to oxacillin, Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis, corynebacterium sp. strain JK, Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium fortuitum (three strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested. Serum bactericidal activities (SBAs) were greater than or equal to 1:8 in greater than or equal to 80% of the sera 1 and 6 h after 30 mg/kg and in greater than or equal to 60% of the sera 1 and 6 h after 15 mg/kg against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis susceptible to oxacillin, A. calcoaceticus, and K. pneumoniae. L. monocytogenes, Serratia marcescens, and P. aeruginosa had lower SBAs. Very low or no activity was observed against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and Streptococcus faecalis. The study of the killing rate in serum confirmed these results. Postantibiotic effect was studied by incubating a strain from each species in serum samples obtained 1 and 6 h after both regimens for 0.5, 1, or 2 h. The duration of postantibiotic effect depended on the duration of contact and the concentration of amikacin for the following organisms: oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci, L. monocytogenes, P. aeruginosa, A. calcoaceticus, K. pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens. M. fortuitum was killed after 30 min of contact. No postantibiotic effect was observed with Streptococcus faecalis, Corynebacterium sp. strain JK, or oxacillin-resistant staphylococci. Amikacin at 30 mg/kg provided high levels and SBAs against susceptible pathogens. Prolonged postantibiotic effects were observed. No signs of nephrotoxicity occurred.
TI  - Adhesion of bacteria from mixed cell suspension to solid surfaces.
AB  - The attachment of four species of bacteria to solid surfaces was investigated to  determine whether the attachment of one species of bacterium could be influenced by the presence of other attaching or attached species. Three types of experiment were done: attachment of bacteria from suspensions containing two species (termed "simultaneous attachment") was compared to attachment of each species in pure culture, the attachment of one species of bacterium to surfaces already colonized by a second species (termed "sequential attachment") was compared to attachment of the bacteria to clean, uncolonized surfaces, and bacteria were allowed to attach to a surface already colonized by a second strain, and their effect on the stabilization of adhesion of the initial colonizing strain was determined. The bacteria were Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, a Staphylococcus sp., a coryneform (isolates from a canning factory), and Staphylococcus aureus. The surfaces were tin plate, glass, and nylon. The attachment of each species was either increased, decreased or not affected by the simultaneous or sequential attachment of another species. The results depended upon the species combination, the surface composition, and the sequence of attachment. The detachment of a primary colonizing species was either increased, decreased or not affected by the subsequent attachment of a second species, depending on the species combination and surface. The results demonstrate that bacterial attachment to a surface can be influenced by the composition of the attaching population and can differ considerably from the attachment of the component species in pure culture.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Nosocomial infections in a respiratory intensive care unit.
AB  - A total of 250 consecutive admissions to an open-plan respiratory ICU were analyzed prospectively to identify the incidence of secondary hospital-acquired infections and possible predisposing factors. Despite preventative measures and a restricted antibiotic policy, 23.6% of patients developed secondary infections. Patients admitted after multiple trauma were the only diagnostic category of patients who showed a significantly increased incidence of secondary infections. The length of hospitalization and number of patients who had intubations or tracheostomies was higher in the group with secondary infection; the causal relationship was difficult to establish. Patients who were not intubated or tracheostomized did not develop secondary infection. Prior administration of antibiotics did not appear to influence the incidence of secondary infection. There was a significant increase in secondary infections in patients with a higher therapeutic intervention scoring system score. The predominant pathogens cultured were highly resistant Gram-negative organisms, particularly Acinetobacter sp. and Pseudomonas sp. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common Gram-positive pathogen. The ICU course was probably prolonged by the complication of nosocomial infection, which may have contributed to the deaths.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of CI-934 compared with that of other new 4-quinolones and  nalidixic acid.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of CI-934, a new 4-quinolone compound, was compared with that of the other new 4-quinolones, enoxacin and ciprofloxacin, and also with that of nalidixic acid. CI-934 was more active than any of the other 4-quinolones tested against Gram-positive aerobic organisms including Staphylococcus aureus (MICs 0.06-0.25 mg/l), beta-haemolytic streptococci (MICs 0.12-0.5 mg/l), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MICs 0.25-0.5 ml/l), viridans streptococci (MICs 0.06-0.5 mg/l) and most enterococci (MICs 0.12-0.5 mg/l), although some ampicillin-resistant isolates of Str. faecium were slightly less susceptible (MICs 2 mg/l). All three of the newer 4-quinolones tested were highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, Aeromonas sp., Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MICs mostly less than 1 mg/l). The other Gram-negative aerobes tested were in general somewhat less susceptible, although for Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas aeruginosa MICs seldom exceeded 8 mg/l. CI-934 was more active than enoxacin against Gardnerella vaginalis (MICs 1-8 mg/l) although it was a little less active than ciprofloxacin. Bacteroides species (including about half of the fragilis group) were susceptible to CI-934 (MICs mostly 1-8 mg/l): ciprofloxacin had similar activity but enoxacin was less active. Other anaerobes tested were mostly highly susceptible to CI-934 (MICs 1 mg/l or less) but were somewhat less susceptible to enoxacin and ciprofloxacin.
TI  - [Multicenter study of the in vitro effect of imipenem (N-formimidoyl-thienamycin) on hospital bacteria].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of imipenem were evaluated by agar dilution for 2 895 bacterial strains isolated in 9 hospitals. Imipenem proved highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, with an MIC less than or equal to 0.25 for 63% of the 1 556 tested strains, less than or equal to 1 for 89.6% and less than or equal to 4 for 99%. The different groups of Enterobacteriaceae exhibited similar mode MICs (0.12 to 0.25), with the exception of Serratia (0.25-0.5), P. mirabilis (0.5), indole-positive Proteus (2), and Providencia (1). MICs of most cefotaxime-resistant strains were within the susceptibility range. Imipenem also exhibited satisfactory activity against P. aeruginosa (mode MIC 1-2) and Acinetobacter sp. (mode MIC: 0.25-0.5). MICs ranged from 0.03 to 4 (mode MIC: 0.5) for Haemophilus sp. and 0.25 to 1 for Gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status. MICs for Meningococci were less than or equal to 0,06. Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococci had low MICs, ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 (mode MIC : 0.016); MICs for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely, from 0.016 to 64, and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees C. Streptococci, except for Enterococci, and Pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008-0.03); MICs for Enterococci varied from 0,12 to 32 (mode MIC: 1-2). Except for four C. difficile strains, all tested anaerobic strains were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 1 (mode MICs: 0.06 for C. perfringens and 0.03 for B. fragilis).
TI  - [In vitro activity of ceftriaxone on hospital bacteria. Results of a multicenter  study].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ceftriaxone were determined by agar dilution for 2 099 strains isolated in six teaching hospitals. MICs were less than 1 microgram/ml for the great majority of Enterobacteriaceae, with mode MICs varying across groups from less than 0.008 micrograms/ml for Proteus (mirabilis and indole-positive) to 0.25 for Enterobacter. Only a few resistant strains were found, mainly among Enterobacter and Citrobacter. Ceftriaxone proved noticeably less active against P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter (mode MICs: 16 micrograms/ml). Haemophilus sp. and Gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase production status, as well as Neisseria meningitidis, were highly susceptible (MIC less than 0.008-0.032). Ceftriaxone was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC: 2 to 8 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin resistant strains. Enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant, whereas the other Streptococci and Pneumococci had low MICs (0.03-0.25). A fairly wide range of MICs was found for anaerobes (Clostridium: 0.06-2, Bacteroides: 0.5-32). Our data show that its particularly strong activity against Proteus, Haemophilus and Neisseria sets ceftriaxone apart from the other third-generation cephalosporins.
TI  - Assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  - Blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (CFU) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. At intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (HS-GLC). Forty-six isolates including all those examined of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. faecalis, S. milleri, S. mitior, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Bacterioides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, C. krusei and Torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by HS-GLC. HS-GLC failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Haemophilus influenzae, Corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of S. epidermidis. The growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. No significant difference was found between HS-GLC analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. All the yeast isolates were detected by HS-GLC after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by HS-GLC analysis than by other methods.
TI  - Effect of saccharin on growth and acid production of glucose-grown pathogenic and oral bacteria.
AB  - Growth and acid production of glucose-grown Gram-positive and Gram-negative rods  as well as cocci from the human oral cavity were studied in the presence of 0.02 to 20.00 mg/ml sodium saccharin. All Gram-positive rods, i.e. Actinomyces viscosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bacillus subtilis and Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and Gram-positive cocci, i.e. Streptococcus spp, Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus, were significantly inhibited by saccharin, especially at the higher concentrations. While Gram-negative cocci, i.e. Veillonella sp and Neisseria sicca were strongly inhibited by all tested saccharin concentrations, Gram-negative rods, i.e. the enterics and Acinetobacter sp, exhibited little if any inhibition. Saccharin caused a significant reduction in fermentative acid production congruent with observed growth.
TI  - [Sensitivity to fosfomycin of bacteria isolated at the Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital in 1982 and 1983].
AB  - Susceptibility of 16 056 strains isolated in 1982 and 1983 to fosfomycin (FOS) was tested with Mueller-Hinton medium and discs 50 micrograms FOS + 25 micrograms glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) (cutoff diameter 14 mm). For 3 411 strains, inhibition zone diameters were recorded. Almost all E. coli, Citrobacter, Salmonella and S. aureus were susceptible to FOS as well as 70% of Serratia, E. cloacae, P. mirabilis and 50% of Klebsiella and Enterobacter sp. Only 27% of P. aeruginosa, 20% of indole positive Proteus and 8% of Acinetobacter were sensitive to FOS. E. coli, Citrobacter and S. aureus seem to exhibit the highest susceptibilities to FOS. Sensitivity rates of E. cloacae, Serratia, P. aeruginosa, and especially Klebsiella seemed slightly underestimated by the disk diffusion method, but differentiation between susceptible and resistant strains was facilitated by rating as susceptible those strains with inhibition zone diameters between 12 and 14 mm. This method also seemed to underrate the sensitivity of susceptible Enterobacteriaceae, probably because of inadequate G6P concentrations at this point of the disk.
TI  - [In vitro activity of ceftizoxime on hospital bacteria. Results of a multicenter  study].
AB  - The susceptibility to ceftizoxime of all bacterial strains isolated from seven university-affiliated hospitals over one month was tested with disk-diffusion technique. Additionally, the MIC of 1937 strains selected at random was evaluated by the agar dilution method. The majority of Enterobacteriaceae are inhibited at a concentration of less than 1 microgram/ml with a mode MIC varying from 0.008 to 0.12 among the various groups. A few Enterobacter and Citrobacter strains are resistant. Little activity was demonstrated by ceftizoxime on Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter sp. (mode MIC 32 and 8 micrograms/ml respectively). Haemophilus sp. (MIC 0.01-0.03) and Neisseria (MIC less than 0,008-0,016) are very susceptible to the drug. The MIC of methicillin-sensitive strains of Staphylococcus aureus varies from 1 to 4 micrograms/ml ; Enterococci are less susceptible, whereas other Streptococci and Pneumococci have low MICs (less than 0.008-0.025). The susceptibility of anaerobic pathogens varies widely between species, and within species ; MIC ranges from 0.008 to 32 micrograms/ml for Clostridium sp. and 0.25 to 128 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides sp.
TI  - Isolations of aerobic bacteria from wild desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni and O. c. mexicana) in Arizona.
AB  - Nasal, pharyngeal, cervical and vaginal swab specimens were obtained from 74 desert bighorn sheep for the purpose of investigating the normal aerobic bacterial flora of wild sheep. A total of 281 isolates was obtained and identified by standard microbiologic tests. One hundred seven of these isolates were gram positive and included Bacillus sp. (36%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (8%), S. aureus (4%), Corynebacterium sp. (diphtheroids, 4%), and Streptococcus sp. (48%). gram negative isolates totaled 174 and included Neisseria sp. (18%), Citrobacter sp. (3%), Enterobacter sp. (2%), Escherichia coli (2%), Proteus sp. (2%) and non-fermentative bacilli (NFB) (73%). Of the NFB isolates, Pseudomonas sp. (25%), Acinetobacter sp. (18%), Moraxella sp. (15%) were identified.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftazidime and ceftriaxone.
AB  - The in vitro susceptibility of 230 clinical isolates, including 55 anaerobic bacteria, was tested with ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, moxalactam, cefamandole, cefoxitin, and ticarcillin. Ceftazidime was the most active drug against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter sp. Against Enterobacteriaceae, ceftazidime and ceftriaxone were similar to cefotaxime, moxalactam, and cefoperazone and more active than cefamandole, cefoxitin, and ticarcillin. Cefoxitin and moxalactam were significantly more active against Bacteroides fragilis than were the other beta-lactam drugs. Against Staphylococcus aureus, ceftriaxone showed moderate activity, while ceftazidime was relatively inactive. These results indicate a potential role for ceftazidime and ceftriaxone against infections involving facultative and aerobic gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - In vitro activity of norfloxacin, a quinolinecarboxylic acid, compared with that  of beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  - Norfloxacin is a quinolinecarboxylic acid compound. We examined the in vitro activity of this compound against gram-positive and -negative species, including anaerobic species. It inhibited 90% (MIC90) of strains of Escherichia coli at 0.05 microgram/ml, Klebsiella sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, Salmonella and Shigella spp. at 0.1 microgram/ml, Citrobacter sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, Enterobacter cloacae at 0.2 microgram/ml, Enterobacter aerogenes at 0.4 microgram/ml, and Enterobacter agglomerans at 0.2 microgram/ml. The MICs of Proteus mirabilis, Morganella sp., Proteus vulgaris, Proteus rettgeri, and Providencia sp. were 0.1, 0.2, 0.8, 0.3, and 1.6 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 of Serratia sp. was 1.6 micrograms/ml, and that of Acinetobacter sp. was 6.3 micrograms/ml. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa the MIC50, the MIC75, and the MIC90 were 0.8, 1.6, and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC50 of Pseudomonas maltophilia was 3.1 micrograms/ml, and the MIC90 was 12.5 micrograms/ml. Yersinia, Arizona, and Aeromonas all were inhibited at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml, as was Campylobacter. The activity of the compound against gram-positive species was less impressive: the MIC90s of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus faecalis were 1.6, 6.3, 3.1, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. All Listeria strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml. The activity of norfloxacine was not affected by the type of medium, pH, or inoculum size. There was no major difference between MIC and minimum bactericidal concentration values. Norfloxacin inhibited bacteria in every species which was resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim at concentrations lower than those of aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, moxalactam, and aminoglycosides.
TI  - [Histological and bacteriological examination of uterus from the repeat breeder gilt and sow (author's transl)].
AB  - The investigation comprised sexual organs from 25 gilts and 97 sows culled because of repeat breeding. Among the gilts 24.0 per cent and among the sows 25.8 per cent had endometritis. The following germs were present in uterus from gilts and sows with signs of endometritis: Staphylococcus aureus, Corynebacterium pyogenes, alpha-hemolytiske streptococcer, Escherichia coli, Pasteurella sp., Aeromonas sp., Acinetobacter sp. and Citrobacter sp. Among gilts and sows with germs present in uterus 40.9 per cent had endometritis. The corresponding per cent among gilts and sows without germs present was 25.0.
TI  - BB-K 122: in vitro and in vivo activity against ocular pathogens.
AB  - BB-K 122 is a new aminoglycoside antibiotic and an analogue of amikacin. This study evaluated the in vitro and in vivo activity of BB-K 122 and gentamicin against important ocular pathogens. BB-K 122 and gentamicin demonstrated generally equivalent in vitro antibacterial activity, except that gentamicin was more active against Streptococcus sp. BB-K 122 showed significant in vitro activity against important ophthalmic pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and species of Klebsiella, Escherichia, Proteus, Haemophilus, and Moraxella. Solutions of BB-K 122 (1%) and gentamicin sulfate (0.3%) were compared in an experimentally induced rabbit keratoconjunctivitis model. Rabbit eyes infected with P. aeruginosa or S. pneumoniae were treated with one of the two antibiotic formulations and evaluated after 24 h. A topical formulation of 1% BB-K 122 was at least as effective as gentamicin sulfate (0.3%) solution against these infections.
TI  - Interference of Neisseria gonorrhoeae growth by aerobic bacterial representatives of the urogenital flora.
AB  - Aerobic bacterial isolates obtained from endocervical, vaginal and urethral swabbings were tested for interference of neisseria gonorrhoeae growth on solid medium. Simultaneous antagonism was studied using the lawn spotting method, and delayed antagonism by the basal spot/lawn method. From 58 swabbings we recuperated a total of 181 isolates, 71 of those were found interfering with at least one out of four gonococcal strains (G-1, G-2, G-3 and G-4). Similar percentages of interfering isolates were obtained from each of the isolation sites. The identification of the interfering isolates has revealed that similar numbers of coagulase negative staphylococci and identical numbers of group D streptococci were found for each of those sites. The majority of the interfering isolates and also of the inhibitory coagulase negative staphylococci showed only simultaneous antagonism. To complete the interference spectrum, we have tested all the active urogenital isolates against four other gonococcal strains (G-7, G-9, G-10 and G-11). This spectrum showed clearly that interference is not an all or none phenomenon. While the gonococcal interference spectrum of most of the Gram positive cocci and the Acinetobacter sp. strains is broad, that of all the other isolates is relatively narrow. Gonococcal strains G-7 and G-9 were the most susceptible to inhibition by the interfering urogenital isolates while strain G-3 was the most resistant one.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity of O-demethylfortimicin A, a derivative of fortimicin A.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of O-demethylfortimicin A (ODMF), a derivative of fortimicin A, was compared with those of fortimicin A and gentamicin against a spectrum of 256 organisms. All three antibiotics were active in low concentrations against all strains of Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter sp., and Staphylococcus aureus, with ODMF most active against Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus, and Providencia and gentamicin most active against other species. Activity of each of the antibiotics against group D streptococci was poor. The overall activity of ODMF was superior to that of fortimicin A for all groups of organisms examined and was most pronounced, approximately three-fold, against strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Both ODMF and fortimicin A were resistant to the action of several aminoglycoside-inactivating enzymes, with the exception of 3-N-acetyltransferase-I. ODMF and fortimicin A showed similar rapid bactericidal effects at multiples of the minimum inhibitory concentration and equivalent synergistic activity against enterococci when combined with penicillin G. The combination of carbenicillin with ODMF, fortimicin A, or gentamicin was synergistic for approximately 80% of the P. aeruginosa strains tested. Inactivation of ODMF and fortimicin A when combined with carbenicillin in vitro was minimal or absent, whereas gentamicin was substantially inactivated under similar conditions. ODMF, fortimicin A, and gentamicin exhibited protective activity in mice infected with Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, S. aureus, or P. aeruginosa. Gentamicin was the most active, followed by ODMF and fortimicin A. The superior in vitro activity of ODMF compared with fortimicin A against P. aeruginosa was confirmed in vivo.
TI  - In vitro activity of a new semisynthetic cephalosporin: cefoperazone.
AB  - Cefoperazone is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with excellent antibacterial activity. This study included more than 1,500 clinical isolates whose susceptibility to cefoperazone was determined by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC). Cefoperazone was highly active against Enterobacteriaceae including indolepositive Proteus, Serratia and Enterobacter sp. Particularly noteworthy was the high activity of cefoperazone against Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter strains, which are usually resistant to first- and second-generation cephalosporins. The activity of cefoperazone against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, group D streptococci and Haemophilus was also determined. In general, the differences between MIC and MBC were minimal. Additional studies were carried out to determine the effect of inoculum size on cefoperazone activity.
TI  - Differential toxicities of mercury to bacteria and bacteriophages in sea and in lake water.
AB  - Mixtures of anionic HgCl3-/HgCl4(2)-complexes were less toxic to terrestrial bacteria (Erwinia herbicola, Agrobacterium tumefaciens), to marine bacteria (Acinetobacter sp., Aeromonas sp.), and to bacteriophages (phi 11 M 15 of Staphylococcus aureus and P1 of Escherichia coli) than were equivalent concentrations of Hg as cationic Hg2+. The toxicity of 1 ppm Hg to A. tumefaciens. Aeromonas sp., and phi 11 M 15 was less in seawater than in lake water. Inasmuch as the Hg-Cl species are formed in environments of high chloride concentration, it was postulated that the lower toxicity of Hg in seawater was a result of the formation of HgCl3-/HgCl4(2)-complexes.
TI  - Rapid antimicrobial susceptibility test using tetrazolium reduction.
AB  - A rapid method of antimicrobial susceptibility testing has been developed, which  uses a modified microdilution procedure and an inoculum of 10(7) bacteria per ml. Results are determined within 4 h with an indicator consisting of 2(p-iodophenyl)-3(p-nitrophenyl)-5-phenyltetrazolium chloride. The precipitation of a red formazan by bacteria uninhibited by antimicrobials is accelerated by the addition of phenazine methosulfate. Isolates are classified as resistant, indeterminate, or susceptible, based on growth in up to two antimicrobial concentrations which conform closely to concentrations which correlate with the millimeter breakpoints used in the Bauer-Kirby method. Results of testing 10 antimicrobial agents against 1,126 isolates were compared with results obtained when the Bauer-Kirby method and the agar dilution procedure were used as reference methods. Enterococci were excluded because of false resistance. Discrepancies were classified as very major (false susceptibility), major (false resistance), and minor (combinations of susceptibility or resistance with indeterminate results). The rapid method versus the agar dilution method yielded 2.3% very major, 0.7% major, and 2.9% minor discrepancies, for a total of 6.0%. Of 58 organism-antimicrobial agent combinations tested, 23 displayed 1% very major discrepancies between the rapid method and the agar dilution method. Six were not therapeutically important. The remainder involved Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Acinetobacter sp., and most organisms tested with chloramphenicol. It is suggested that adjustments in antibiotic concentrations and/or inoculum size may eliminate these discrepancies. The rapid method appeared economical when compared with Autobac 1 and the Bauer-Kirby procedure.
