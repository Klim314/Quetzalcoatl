TI  == bacterial xylose isomerases from the mammal gut bacteroidetes cluster function in saccharomyces cerevisiae for effective xylose fermentation.
AB  == background: xylose isomerase (xi) catalyzes the conversion of xylose to xylulose, which is the key step for anaerobic ethanolic fermentation of xylose. very few bacterial xis can function actively in saccharomyces cerevisiae. here, we illustrate a group of xis that would function for xylose fermentation in s. cerevisiae through phylogenetic analysis, recombinant yeast strain construction,  and xylose fermentation. results: phylogenetic analysis of deposited xi sequences showed that xi evolutionary relationship was highly consistent with the bacterial taxonomic orders and quite a few functional xis in s. cerevisiae were clustered with xis from mammal gut bacteroidetes group. an xi from bacteroides valgutus in  this cluster was actively expressed in s. cerevisiae with an activity comparable  to the fungal xi from piromyces sp. two xi genes were isolated from the environmental metagenome and they were clustered with xis from environmental bacteroidetes group. these two xis could not be expressed in yeast with activity. with the xi from b. valgutus expressed in s. cerevisiae, background yeast strains were optimized by pentose metabolizing pathway enhancement and adaptive evolution in xylose medium. afterwards, more xis from the mammal gut bacteroidetes group, including those from b. vulgatus, tannerella sp. 6_1_58faa_ct1, paraprevotella xylaniphila and alistipes sp. hgb5, were individually transformed into s. cerevisiae. the known functional xi from orpinomyces sp. ukk1, a mammal gut fungus, was used as the control. all the resulting recombinant yeast strains were able to ferment xylose. the respiration-deficient strains harboring b. vulgatus and alistipes sp. hgb5 xi genes respectively obtained specific xylose consumption rate of 0.662 and 0.704 g xylose gcdw(-1) h(-1), and ethanol specific productivity of 0.277 and 0.283 g ethanol gcdw(-1) h(-1), much comparable to those obtained by the control strain carrying orpinomyces sp. ukk1 xi gene. conclusions: this study demonstrated that xis clustered in the mammal gut bacteroidetes group were able to be expressed functionally in s. cerevisiae and background strain anaerobic adaptive evolution in xylose medium is essential for  the screening of functional xis. the methods outlined in this paper are instructive for the identification of novel xis that are functional in s. cerevisiae.
