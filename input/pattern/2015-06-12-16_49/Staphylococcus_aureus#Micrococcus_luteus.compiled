TI  - Critical roles of sea cucumber C-type lectin in non-self recognition and bacterial clearance.
AB  - C-type lectin is one important pattern recognition receptor (PRR) that plays crucial roles in multiple immune responses. A C-type lectin from sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus (AjCTL-1) was characterized in the present study. The amino acid sequence of AjCTL-1 shared high similarities with other C-type lectins from invertebrates and vertebrates. The C-type lectin domain (CTLD) of AjCTL-1 contained a Ca2+-binding site 2 and four conserved cysteine residues. AjCTL-1 mRNA expression patterns in tissues and after bacterial challenge were then analyzed. Quantitative PCR revealed that AjCTL-1 mRNA was widely expressed in the tested tissues of healthy sea cucumber. The highest expression level occurred in gonad followed by body wall, coelomocytes, tentacle, intestinum and longitudinal muscle, and the lowest expression level was in respiratory tree. AjCTL-1 mRNA expression in coelomocytes was significantly induced by gram-negative Listonella anguillarum and gram-positive Micrococcus luteus, with different up-regulation patterns post-challenge. Recombinant AjCTL-1 exhibited the ability to bind peptidoglycan directly, agglutinate M. luteus, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, in a Ca2+-dependant manner, and enhance the phagocytosis of coelomocytes against E. coli in vitro. The results indicated that AjCTL-1 could act as a PRR in A. japonicas and had critical roles in non-self recognition and bacterial clearance against invading microbes.
TI  - An antibacterial ortho-quinone diterpenoid and its derivatives from Caryopteris mongolica.
AB  - To identify antibacterial components in traditional Mongolian medicinal plant Caryopteris mongolica, an ortho-quinone abietane caryopteron A (1) and three its derivatives caryopteron B-D (2-4) were isolated from the roots of the plant together with three known abietanes demethylcryptojaponol (5), 6alpha-hydroxydemethyl cryptojaponol (6), and 14-deoxycoleon U (7). The chemical structures of these abietane derivatives were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic data. Compounds 1-4 had C-13 methylcyclopropane substructures, and 2-4 had a hexanedioic anhydride ring C instead of ortho-quinone in 1. The stereochemistry of these compound was assumed from NOE spectra and ECD Cotton effects. Compounds 1 and 5-7 showed antibacterial activities against the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Micrococcus luteus, being 1 the more potent.
TI  - Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of 4-benzoyl-1-dichlorobenzoylthiosemicarbazides as potent Gram-positive antibacterial agents.
AB  - Twelve 4-benzoyl-1-dichlorobenzoylthiosemicarbazides have been tested as potential antibacterials. All the compounds had MICs between 0.49 and 15.63 microg/ml toward Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus epidermidis indicating, in most cases, equipotent or even more effective action than cefuroxime. In order to clarify if the observed antibacterial effects are universal, further research were undertaken to test inhibitory potency of two most potent compounds 3 and 11 on clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus. Compound 11 inhibited the growth of methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) at MICs of 1.95-7.81 microg/ml, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) at MICs of 0.49-1.95 microg/ml and MDR-MRSA at MIC of 0.98 and 3.90 microg/ml, respectively. Finally, inhibitory efficacy of 3 and 11 on planktonic cells and biofilms formation in clinical isolates of S. aureus and Haemophilus parainfluenzae was tested. The majority of cells in biofilm populations of MSSA and MRSA were eradicated at low level of 3, with MBICs in the range of 7.82-15.63 microg/ml.
TI  - Chemical composition and pharmacological properties of the essential oils obtained seasonally from Lippia thymoides.
AB  - CONTEXT: Lippia thymoides Mart. & Schauer (Verbenaceae) is used in folk medicine  to treat wounds, fever, bronchitis, rheumatism, headaches, and weakness. OBJECTIVE: This study determinates the chemical composition of essential oils from L. thymoides, obtained at during each of the four seasons and correlates with pharmacological properties. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Essential oils were obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). Antioxidant activity was determined by DPPH free radical scavenging and beta-carotene bleaching methods. The antimicrobial assays were performed by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum microbicidal concentration (MMC) methods. Isolated rat aorta and uterus, and guinea-pig trachea were utilized to evaluate relaxant potential in pre-contracted smooth muscle. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Essential oils from leaves of L. thymoides had the sesquiterpene beta-caryophyllene (17.22-26.27%) as the major constituent followed by borneol (4.45-7.36%), camphor (3.22-8.61%), camphene (2.64-5.66%), and germacrene D (4.72-6.18%). In vitro assays showed that these essential oils do not have antioxidant activity, have antimicrobial selectivity to Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (MIC = 0.004 mg/mL and MMC = 0.26-10.19 mg/mL) and Micrococcus luteus (MIC = 0.03 mg/mL and MMC = 8.43 mg/mL), relax isolated rat aorta (EC50 = 305-544 mug/mL, with endothelium; and EC50 = 150-283 mug/mL, without endothelium), and uterus (EC50 = 74-257 mug/mL), and minor potency, isolated guinea-pig trachea. CONCLUSIONS: Lippia thymoides is a source of natural products of pharmaceutical interest, being necessary additional studies to determine the substances involved in the biological activities.
TI  - Functional gene-based discovery of phenazines from the actinobacteria associated  with marine sponges in the South China Sea.
AB  - Phenazines represent a large group of nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds  produced by the diverse group of bacteria including actinobacteria. In this study, a total of 197 actinobacterial strains were isolated from seven different marine sponge species in the South China Sea using five different culture media. Eighty-seven morphologically different actinobacterial strains were selected and grouped into 13 genera, including Actinoalloteichus, Kocuria, Micrococcus, Micromonospora, Mycobacterium, Nocardiopsis, Prauserella, Rhodococcus, Saccharopolyspora, Salinispora, Serinicoccus, and Streptomyces by the phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene. Based on the screening of phzE genes, ten strains, including five Streptomyces, two Nocardiopsis, one Salinispora, one Micrococcus, and one Serinicoccus were found to be potential for phenazine production. The level of phzE gene expression was highly expressed in Nocardiopsis sp. 13-33-15, 13-12-13, and Serinicoccus sp. 13-12-4 on the fifth day of fermentation. Finally, 1,6-dihydroxy phenazine (1) from Nocardiopsis sp. 13-33-15 and 13-12-13, and 1,6-dimethoxy phenazine (2) from Nocardiopsis sp. 13-33-15 were isolated and identified successfully based on ESI-MS and NMR analysis. The compounds 1 and 2 showed antibacterial activity against Bacillus mycoides SJ14, Staphylococcus aureus SJ51, Escherichia coli SJ42, and Micrococcus luteus SJ47. This study suggests that the integrated approach of gene screening and chemical analysis is an effective strategy to find the target compounds and lays the basis for the production of phenazine from the sponge-associated actinobacteria.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Hypericum ascyron L. (H. ascyron L.) has been used as a traditional medicine for the treatment of wounds, swelling, headache, nausea, stomach ache, abscesses, dysentery and chronic bronchitis. Pharmacological studies are necessary to provide a scientific basis to substantiate their traditional use. In this study, antimicrobial effect and its mechanism of the H. ascyron L. extract was investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antimicrobial activity of the H. ascyron L. extract was evaluated by the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (MTT). To confirm the antimicrobial mechanism of H. ascyron L. extract on bacterial cells, Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) double staining, TUNEL, and DNA laddering analysis were performed. RESULTS: Antibacterial effects of the H. ascyron L. extract were tested on Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumonia, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus, and the results showed that the sensitive bacteria of H. ascyron L. extract mainly included E. coli, S. aureus and M. luteus, especially M. luteus. The MBC value of H. ascyron L. extract on M. luteus was equal to the MIC (20mg/mL). H. ascyron L. extract could induce cells death of M. luteus through apoptosis pathway. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides scientific support for some of the traditional uses and the pharmacological activities of H. ascyron L. Our data provide a rational base for the folkloric use of H. ascyron L.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of selected medicinal plants from lower Himalayas.
AB  - The present studies cover antibacterial activity of the crude methanolic extracts of 11 medicinal plants viz. Adhatoda vasica, Bauhenia variegate, Bombax ceiba, Carrisa opaca, Caryopteris grata, Debregeasia salicifolia, Lantana camara, Melia azedarach, Phyllanthus emblica, Pinus roxburghii and Olea ferruginea collected from lower Himalayas against two Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus) and two Gram negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aureginosa) bacterial strains. The extracts were applied at four different concentrations (120 mg/mL, 90mg/mL, 60mg/mL and 30mg/mL) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) by using agar well diffusion method. Antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus were observed formethanolic extracts of all the above mentioned plants. Greater antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was only exhibited by Phyllanthus emblica, Pinus roxburghii, Debregeasia salicifolia and Lantana camara. Escherichia coli was highly resistant to all the plant extracts at all concentrations. It is inferred that methanolic crude extracts of the above mentioned plantsexhibitantibacterial activities against pathogenic bacteria, which proved the ethnobotanical importance of the selected plants that indigenous people use for cure against various diseases.
TI  - One-pot multi-component synthesis of 1,4-dihydropyridines using Zn(2+) @KSF and evaluating their antibacterial and antioxidant activities.
AB  - New 5-aryl-10-(4-(4-methoxyphenyl)thiazole-2-yl)-9,10-dihydropyrido[2,3-d:5,6-d']dipy rimidinone-2,4,6,8-(1H,3H,5H,7H)-tetraones 6a-d were synthesized through one-pot four-component reaction of aldehydes, barbituric acid, and thiazole using Zn(2+) @KSF under reflux condition. The key features of this reaction are: incorporating four heterocyclic rings, using a heterogeneous and efficient catalyst, high yield, and easy-to-setup reaction. The structure of the products was confirmed by FT-IR, (1)H NMR, and (13)C NMR spectra. The antibacterial activities of compounds 6a-d were screened against Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus bacterial strains using the zone inhibition method. Also, the 2,2-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activities of compounds 6a-d were evaluated. All compounds showed good antioxidant capacity in comparison to ascorbic acid. The IC50 values of the antioxidant activity were calculated. The proposed mechanism for antioxidant activity is discussed.
TI  - Structural modification of herboxidiene by substrate-flexible cytochrome P450 and glycosyltransferase.
AB  - Herboxidiene is a natural product produced by Streptomyces chromofuscus exhibiting herbicidal activity as well as antitumor properties. Using different substrate-flexible cytochrome P450s and glycosyltransferase, different novel derivatives of herboxidiene were generated with structural modifications by hydroxylation or epoxidation or conjugation with a glucose moiety. Moreover, two isomers of herboxidiene containing extra tetrahydrofuran or tetrahydropyran moiety in addition to the existing tetrahydropyran moiety were characterized. The hydroxylated products for both of these compounds were also isolated and characterized from S. chromofuscus PikC harboring pikC from the pikromycin gene cluster of Streptomyces venezuelae and S. chromofuscus EryF harboring eryF from the erythromycin gene cluster of Saccharopolyspora erythraea. The compounds generated were characterized by high-resolution quadrupole-time-of-flight electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HR-QTOF-ESI/MS) and (1)H- and (13)C-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses. The evaluation of antibacterial activity against three Gram-positive bacteria, Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus aureus, indicated that modification resulted in a transition from anticancer to antibacterial potency.
TI  - Composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils of Laserpitium latifolium L. and L. ochridanum Micevski (Apiaceae).
AB  - The chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils of Laserpitium latifolium and L. ochridanum were investigated. The essential oils were isolated by steam distillation and characterized by GC-FID and GC/MS analyses. All essential oils were distinguished by high contents of monoterpenes, and alpha-pinene was the most abundant compound in the essential oils of L. latifolium underground parts and fruits (contents of 44.4 and 44.0%, resp.). The fruit essential oil was also rich in sabinene (26.8%). Regarding the L. ochridanum essential oils, the main constituents were limonene in the fruit oil (57.7%) and sabinene in the herb oil (25.9%). The antimicrobial activity of these essential oils as well as that of L. ochridanum underground parts, whose composition was reported previously, was tested by the broth-microdilution method against four Gram-positive and three Gram-negative bacteria and two Candida albicans strains. Except the L. latifolium underground-parts essential oil, the other investigated oils showed a high antimicrobial potential against Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, or Candida albicans (minimal inhibitory concentrations of 13.0-73.0 mug/ml), comparable to or even higher than that of thymol, which was used as reference compound.
TI  - Prenylated benzophenones from Triadenum japonicum.
AB  - Six new prenylated benzophenones, (-)-nemorosonol (1) and trijapins A-E (2-6), were isolated from the aerial parts of Triadenum japonicum. (-)-Nemorosonol (1) and trijapins A-C (2-4) have a common tricyclo[4.3.1.0(3,7)]decane skeleton, while 1 is an enantiomer of (+)-nemorosonol previously isolated from Clusia nemorosa. The absolute configuration of (-)-nemorosonol (1) was assigned by ECD spectroscopy. Trijapins A-C (2-4) are analogues of 1 possessing an additional tetrahydrofuran ring. Trijapins D (5) and E (6) are prenylated benzophenones with a 1,2-dioxane moiety and a hydroperoxy group, respectively. (-)-Nemorosonol (1) exhibited antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli (MIC, 8 mug/mL), Staphylococcus aureus (MIC, 16 mug/mL), Bacillus subtilis (MIC, 16 mug/mL), Micrococcus luteus (MIC, 32 mug/mL), Aspergillus niger (IC50, 16 mug/mL), Trichophyton mentagrophytes (IC50, 8 mug/mL), and Candida albicans (IC50, 32 mug/mL), while trijapin D (5) showed antimicrobial activity against C. albicans (IC50, 8 mug/mL).
TI  - Regioselective synthesis, antimicrobial evaluation and theoretical studies of 2-styryl quinolines.
AB  - 2-Styryl quinolines (9a-l) have been synthesized regioselectively from 2-methyl-quinoline by using NaOAc in water acetic acid binary solvents and evaluated for their antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains. Among these, the compounds 12 and 8 were found to be active against both bacterial strains. Compounds 9b, 9f, 9g, 9i, 9j and 9k were the most active among the series exhibiting MIC values ranging between 1.9 and 31.2 mug ml(-1) against different bacterial strains. Compounds 9j and 9k were found to be as potent as the standard drug ciprofloxacin against Micrococcus luteus, Klebsiella planticola and Staphylococcus aureus. In addition, the compounds showed bactericidal activity; compound 9j was found to be better than ciprofloxacin, with an MBC value of 0.9 mug ml(-1) against both M. luteus and K. planticola. The compounds also inhibited biofilm formation, and compound 9j was found to be equipotent to erythromycin against M. luteus and S. aureus MLS16. Further, theoretical studies such as those on druggable properties and PMI plot have been carried out.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and biological activity of new mixed ligand complexes of Zn(II) naproxen with nitrogen based ligands.
AB  - A series of novel Zn(II) complexes [Zn2(nap)4] (1), [Zn(nap)21,10-phen](2), [Zn(nap)22,9-dmphen] (3), [Zn(nap)2(2-ampy)2] (4), [Zn(nap)2(imid)2] (5), [Zn(nap)2(1,2-dmimid)2] (6) (nap = naproxen, 1,10-phen = 1,10-phenanthroline, 2,9-dmphen = 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline, 2-ampy = 2-aminopyridine, imid = imidazole, 1,2-dmimid = 1,2-dimethyl imidazole) were synthesized and characterized using IR, UV-Vis, (1)H NMR, (13)C{(1)H} NMR spectroscopy. The crystal structure of complex 3 was determined using single-crystal X-ray diffraction. In order to assess the effect of the metal ions on the anti-bacterial activity, complexes 1-6 have been screened in vitro, against (G(+)) bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus) and (G(-)) bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli) using the agar well diffusion method. Complex 2 was the only complex that showed antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa, where the complexation of the parent ligand 1,10-phenathroline enhanced significantly the activity. All the complexes showed different activity against the different bacteria, and were compared with activity of the parent ligands. The complexes were tested also for their anti-malarial activity using two methods: a semi-quantitative micro-assay and a previously self-developed quantitative in-vitro method. Both were used to study the efficiency of these complexes in inhibiting the formation of the Malaria pigment. This is considered an important target of many known anti-malarial drugs such as Chloroquine and Amodaquine. Results showed that the efficiency of complex 3 in preventing the formation of beta-hematin was 75%. The efficiency of Amodiaquine as a standard drug was reported to give 92.5.
TI  - Antibacterial activity and genotypic-phenotypic characteristics of bacteriocin-producing Bacillus subtilis KKU213: potential as a probiotic strain.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity and probiotic properties of Bacillus subtilis strain KKU213, isolated from local soil, were investigated. The cell-free supernatant (CFS) of a KKU213 culture containing crude bacteriocins exhibited inhibitory effects on Gram-positive bacteria, including Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus. The antibacterial activity of the CFS precipitated with 40% ammonium sulfate (AS) remained even after treatment at 60 and 100 degrees C, at pH 4 and 10 and with proteolytic enzymes, detergents and heavy metals. When analyzed by SDS-PAGE and overlaid with the indicator strains B. cereus and S. aureus, the 40% AS precipitate exhibited inhibitory activity on proteins smaller than 10 kDa. However, proteins larger than 25 kDa and smaller than 10 kDa were still observed on a native protein gel. Purified subtilosin A was prepared by Amberlite XAD-16 bead extraction and HPLC and analyzed by Nano-LC-QTOF-MS. Its molecular mass was found to be 3.4 kDa, and it retained its antibacterial activity. These results are consistent with the detection of the anti-listerial subtilosin A gene of the sbo/alb cluster in the KKU213 strain, which is 100% identical to that of B. subtilis subsp. subtilis 168. In addition to stable and cyclic subtilosin A, a mixture of many extracellular antibacterial peptides was also detected in the KKU213 culture. The KKU213 strain produced extracellular amylase, cellulase, lipase and protease, is highly acid-resistant (pH 2) when cultured in inulin and promotes health and reduces infection of intestinally colonized broiler chickens. Therefore, we propose that bacteriocin-producing B. subtilis KKU213 could be used as a potential probiotic strain or protective culture.
TI  - Antibiotic oxylipins from Alternanthera brasiliana and its endophytic bacteria.
AB  - Bioassay-guided fractionation of Alternanthera brasiliana stem extracts resulted  in the isolation of an antibiotically active fraction. Five human pathogenic bacteria were used to guide the fractionation process for the isolation of antimicrobial compounds. Finally, 17 linoleate oxylipins were identified by LC-MS/MS and NMR spectroscopy. Five of the isolated compounds present in A. brasiliana tissues were also detected to be synthesized by endophytic bacteria of the genus Bacillus that were isolated from A. brasiliana. It is speculated that the antibiotic oxylipins from A. brasiliana might derive from bacteria and be involved in an ecological relationship between this plant and its endophytes.
TI  - Synthesis of novel benzimidazole functionalized chiral thioureas and evaluation of their antibacterial and anticancer activities.
AB  - A small library of benzimidazole functionalized chiral thioureas was prepared starting from natural amino acids (S)-alanine, (S)-phenylalanine, (S)-valine and (S)-leucine and also their (R)-isomers and studied their antimicrobial activity against a various Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains. In this study, compounds 5g and 5j were found to exhibit good antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains such as Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Klebsiella planticola, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In the cytotoxicity study, thioureas derived from non-natural amino acids 5a-l showed good activity against human cancer cell lines A549, MCF7, DU145, HeLa, and no cytotoxicity was observed with their antipodes 6a-l.
TI  - Antibacterial potential of Calotropis procera (flower) extract against various pathogens.
AB  - Increased bacterial resistance towards commonly used antibiotics has become a debated issue all over the world in a last few decades. Due to this, consumer demand towards natural anti-microbial agents is increasing day by day. Natural anti-microbial agents have gained enormous attention as an alternative therapeutic agent in pharmaceutical industry. Current study is an effort to explore and identify a bactericidal potential of various solvent extracts of Calotropis procera flower. Flowers of C. procera were extracted with hexane, butanol, ethyl acetate and aqua to evaluate the antibacterial activity by agar well diffusion method against the various human pathogens. The microorganisms used in this study includes Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli (O157:H7), Micrococcus luteus KIBGE-IB20 (Gen Bank accession: JQ250612) and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) KIBGE-IB23 (Gen Bank accession: KC465400). Zones of inhibition were observed against all four pathogenic strains. Fraction soluble in hexane showed broad spectrum of inhibition against all the studied pathogens. However, fractions soluble in ethyl acetate inhibited the growth of E. coli, MRSA, and M. luteus. In case of butanol and aqueous extracts only growth of M. luteus was inhibited. Results revealed that the flower extracts of C. procera have a potential to be used as an antibacterial agent against these pathogenic organisms.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of silver nanoparticles synthesized using Pulicaria glutinosa plant extract as a green bioreductant.
AB  - The antibacterial properties of nanoparticles (NPs) can be significantly enhanced by increasing the wettability or solubility of NPs in aqueous medium. In this study, we investigated the effects of the stabilizing agent on the solubility of silver NPs and its subsequent effect on their antimicrobial activities. Silver NPs were prepared using an aqueous solution of Pulicaria glutinosa plant extract as bioreductant. The solution also acts as a capping ligand. During this study, the antimicrobial activities of silver NPs, as well as the plant extract alone, were tested against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Micrococcus luteus. Silver NPs were prepared with various concentrations of the plant extract to study its effect on antimicrobial activity. Interestingly, various concentrations of P. glutinosa extract did not show any effect on the growth of tested bacteria; however, a significant effect on the antimicrobial property of plant extract capped silver NPs (Ag-NPs-PE) was observed. For instance, the half maximal inhibitory concentration values were found to decrease (from 4% to 21%) with the increasing concentrations of plant extract used for the synthesis of Ag-NPs-PE. These results clearly indicate that the addition of P. glutinosa extracts enhances the solubility of Ag-NPs-PE and, hence, increases their toxicity against the tested microorganisms.
TI  - Antibacterial tetraoxygenated xanthones from the immature fruits of Garcinia cowa.
AB  - A phytochemical investigation of the acetone extract from the immature fruits of  Garcinia cowa led to the isolation of two novel tetraoxygenated xanthones, garcicowanones A (1) and B (2), together with eight known tetraoxygeanted xanthones. Their structures were determined by spectroscopic analysis. All isolated compounds were evaluated for their antibacterial activity against Bacillus cereus TISTR 688, Bacillus subtilis TISTR 008, Micrococcus luteus TISTR 884, Staphylococcus aureus TISTR 1466, Escherichia coli TISTR 780, Pseudomonas aeruginosa TISTR 781, Salmonella typhimurium TISTR 292 and Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228. alpha-Mangostin showed potent activity (MIC 0.25-1 mug/mL) against three Gram-positive strains and garcicowanone A and beta-mangostin exhibited strong antibacterial activity against B. cereus with the same MIC values of 0.25 mug/mL.
TI  - Efficient enzymatic systems for synthesis of novel alpha-mangostin glycosides exhibiting antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Two enzymatic systems were developed for the efficient synthesis of glycoside products of alpha-mangostin, a natural xanthonoid exhibiting anti-oxidant, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer activities. In these systems, one-pot reactions for the synthesis of UDP-alpha-D-glucose and UDP-alpha-D-2-deoxyglucose were modified and combined with a glycosyltransferase (GT) from Bacillus licheniformis DSM-13 to afford C-3 and C-6 position modified glucose and 2-deoxyglucose conjugated novel alpha-mangostin derivatives. alpha-Mangostin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, alpha-mangostin 6-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, alpha-mangostin 3,6-di-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, alpha-mangostin 3-O-beta-D-2-deoxyglucopyranoside, alpha-mangostin 6-O-beta-D-2-deoxyglucopyranoside, and alpha-mangostin 3,6-di-O-beta-D-2-deoxyglucopyranoside were successfully produced in practical quantities and characterized by high-resolution quadruple time-of-flight electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (HR-QTOF ESI/MS), (1)H and (13)C NMR analyses. In excess of the substrate, the maximum productions of three alpha-mangostin glucopyranosides (4.8 mg/mL, 86.5 % overall conversion of alpha-mangostin) and three alpha-mangostin 2-deoxyglucopyronosides (4.0 mg/mL, 79 % overall conversion of alpha-mangostin) were achieved at 4-h incubation period. All the alpha-mangostin glycosides exhibited improved water solubility, and their antibacterial activity against three Gram-positive bacteria Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus aureus was drastically enhanced by the glucosylation at C-3 position. In this study, diverse glycosylated alpha-mangostin were produced in significant quantities by using inexpensive starting materials and recycling co-factors within a reaction vessel without use of expensive NDP-sugars in the glycosylation reactions.
TI  - Type I and type II crustins from Penaeus monodon, genetic variation and antimicrobial activity of the most abundant crustinPm4.
AB  - An antimicrobial protein, crustin, is involved in the innate immunity of crustacean by defending the host directly against the microbial pathogens. By data mining the Penaeus monodon EST database, two type I crustins, carcininPm1 and 2, and ten type II crustins, crustinPm1-10, were identified. The abundant crustins were crustinPm1, 4 and 7, each with variation in the length of Gly-rich repeat among its members. A few crustinPm1, 4 and 7 with deletion in the Cys-rich region were also observed. Furthermore, the crustinPm4 with the longest N-terminal Gly-rich region was characterized. The crustinPm4 allelic genes were expressed mainly from the hemocytes. Its expression was up-regulated readily by WSSV infection and gradually decreased to normal level afterwards. The recombinant crustinPm4-1 (rcrustinPm4-1) isoform was produced using the Escherichia coli expression system and tested for its antimicrobial activity. The rcrustinPm4-1 was able to inhibit the growth of a Gram-positive bacterium, Bacillus megaterium but not Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus aureus. It also inhibited the growth of two Gram-negative bacteria, E. coli 363 and Vibrio harveyi 639 at lower potency. The rcrustinPm4-1 affected the WSSV infection because the expression of an intermediate early gene ie1 in WSSV-infected hemocyte cell culture was reduced. It was shown further that the rcrustinPm4-1 could delay by about one and a half days the manifestation of disease by WSSV.
TI  - Influence of acetylation degree and molecular weight of homogeneous chitosans on  antibacterial and antifungal activities.
AB  - The results given in the literature are conflicting when considering the relationship between antimicrobial activity and chitosan characteristics. To be able to clarify, we prepared fifteen homogeneous chitosans with different acetylation degrees (DA) and molecular weights (MW) by reacetylation of a fully deacetylated chitin under homogeneous conditions. They were tested at different pH values for their antimicrobial activities against four Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella typhi), four Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis and Micrococcus luteus) and three fungi (Aspergillus niger, Fusarium oxysporum and Alternaria solani). Chitosans markedly inhibited growth of most bacteria and fungi tested, although the inhibitory effect depends on the type of microorganism and on the chitosan characteristics (DA and MW) with minimum inhibitory concentrations in the range of 0.001 to 0.1 w%. Considering chitosan efficiency on bacteria, our series of data clearly show that the lower DA and the lower pH give the larger efficiency. Antibacterial activity was further enhanced for Gram-negative bacteria with decreasing MW, whereas, opposite effect was observed with the Gram-positive. Concerning the antifungal activity, the influence of chitosan characteristics was dependent on the particular type of fungus. Fungal growth decreased with increasing MW for F. oxysporum and decreasing DA for A. solani, but no MW or DA dependences were observed with A. niger.
TI  - Synthesis of lucifensin by native chemical ligation and characteristics of its isomer having different disulfide bridge pattern.
AB  - The antimicrobial 40-amino-acid-peptide lucifensin was synthesized by native chemical ligation (NCL) using N-acylbenzimidazolinone (Nbz) as a linker group. NCL is a method in which a peptide bond between two discreet peptide chains is created. This method has been applied to the synthesis of long peptides and proteins when solid-phase synthesis is imcompatible. Two models of ligation were developed: [15+25] Ala-Cys and [19+21] His-Cys. The [19+21] His-Cys method gives lower yield because of the lower stability of 18-peptide-His-Nbz-CONH2 peptide, as suggested by density functional theory calculation. Acetamidomethyl-deprotection and subsequent oxidation of the ligated linear lucifensin gave a mixture of lucifensin isomers, which differed in the location of their disulfide bridges only. The dominant isomer showed unnatural pairing of cysteines [C1-6], [C3-5], and [C2-4], which limits its ability to form alpha-helical structure. The activity of isomeric lucifensin toward Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Micrococcus luteus was lower than that of the natural lucifensin. The desired product native lucifensin was prepared from this isomer using a one-pot reduction with dithiotreitol and subsequent air oxidation in slightly alkaline medium.
TI  - New mixed ligand zinc(II) complexes based on the antiepileptic drug sodium valproate and bioactive nitrogen-donor ligands. Synthesis, structure and biological properties.
AB  - Starting from the precursor [Zinc Valproate complex] (1), new mixed ligand zinc(II) complexes of valproic acid and nitrogen-based ligands, formulating as, [Zn(valp)22,9-dmphen] (2), [Zn2(valp)4(quin)2] (3), [Zn(valp)2(2-ampy)2] (4), and [Zn(valp)2(2-ampic)2] (5) (valp = valproate, 2,9-dmphen = 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline, quin = quinoline, 2-ampy = 2-aminopyridine, 2-ampic = 2-amino-6-picoline) were synthesized and characterized using IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C{(1)H} NMR and UV-Vis spectrometry. The crystal structures of complexes 2, 3 and 4 were determined using single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The complexes were also evaluated for their anti-bacterial activity using in-vitro agar diffusion method against three Gram-positive (Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus subtilis) and three Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis) species. Complex 2 showed considerable activity against all tested microorganisms and the effect of complexation on the anti-bacterial activity of the parent ligand of 2 was also investigated. The anti-bacterial activity of 2,9-dmphen against Gram-negative bacteria was enhanced upon complexation with zinc valproate. On the other hand, complexes 1 and 3 showed weak inhibition activity against the tested species and complexes 4 and 5 didn't show any activity at all. Two methods were used for testing the inhibition of ferriprotoporphyrinIX bio-mineralization: a semi-quantitative micro-assay and a previously self-developed quantitative in-vitro method. Both were used to study the efficiency of these complexes in inhibiting the formation of the Malaria pigment which considered being the target of many known anti-malarial drugs such as Chloroquine and Amodiaquine. Results showed that the efficiency of complex 2 in preventing the formation of beta-Hematin was 80%. The efficiency of Amodiaquine as a standard drug was reported to give 91%.
TI  - First total syntheses and antimicrobial evaluation of penicimonoterpene, a marine-derived monoterpenoid, and its various derivatives.
AB  - The first total synthesis of marine-derived penicimonoterpene (+/-)-1 has been achieved in four steps from 6-methylhept-5-en-2-one using a Reformatsky reaction as the key step to construct the basic carbon skeleton. A total of 24 new derivatives of 1 have also been designed and synthesized. Their structures were characterized by analysis of their 1H NMR, 13C NMR and HRESIMS data. Some of them showed significant antibacterial activity against Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio anguillarum, V. harveyi and/or V. parahaemolyticus, and some showed activity against plant-pathogenic fungi (Alternaria brassicae, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and/or Fusarium graminearum). Some of the derivatives exhibited antimicrobial MIC values ranging from 0.25 to 4 mug/mL, which were stronger than those of the positive control. Notably, Compounds 3b and 10 showed extremely high selectively against plant-pathogenic fungus F. graminearum (MIC 0.25 mug/mL) and pathogenic bacteria E. coli (MIC 1 mug/mL), implying their potential as antimicrobial agents. SAR analysis of 1 and its derivatives indicated that modification of the carbon-carbon double bond at C-6/7, of groups on the allylic methylene unit and of the carbonyl group at C-1, effectively enhanced the antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Design, characterization and expression of a novel hybrid peptides melittin (1-13)-LL37 (17-30).
AB  - Hybridizing of different antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) has been a common practice for obtaining novel hybrid AMPs with elevated antibacterial activity but minimized cytotoxicity. The hybrid peptides melittin (1-13)-LL37 (17-30) (M-L) combining the hydrophobic N-terminal fragment of melittin (M) with the core antibacterial fragment of LL37 (L), was designed for the first time to explore its antibacterial activity and hemolytic activity against bacteria and sheep erythrocyte respectively. Results showed that M-L had an even more potent antibacterial activity against all indicator strains (especially gram-positive bacteria) than M and L, whereas didn't exhibit hemolytic activity to sheep erythrocytes, implying M-L can be served as a potential therapeutic drug to substitute traditional antibiotics. However the high expense of biosynthesis limited its further research, therefore fusion expression of M-L was carried out in Escherichia coli (E. coli) for overproducing the hybrid peptide so as to solve the problem. The DNA sequence encoding M-L with preferred codons was cloned into the pET-SUMO vector for protein expression in E. coli BL21 (DE3). After IPTG induction, approximately 165 mg soluble fusion protein SUMO-M-L was recovered per liter supernatant of the fermentation ultrasonic lysate using Ni-NTA Sepharose column (92 % purity). And 23 mg recombinant M-L was obtained per liter culture after cleavage of SUMO protease and purification of Ni-NTA Sepharose column. In sum, this research not only supplied an effective approach for overproducing hybrid peptide M-L, but paved the way for its further exploration on pharmaceutical potential and medical importance.
TI  - Synthesis, antimicrobial evaluation, and structure-activity relationship of alpha-pinene derivatives.
AB  - Several (+)- and (-)-alpha-pinene derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for  their antimicrobial activity toward Gram-positive bacteria Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus aureus, Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli, and the unicellular fungus Candida albicans using bioautographic assays. (+)-alpha-Pinene 1a showed modest activity against the test organisms, whereas (-)-alpha-pinene 1b showed no activity at the tested concentration. Of all the alpha-pinene derivatives evaluated, the beta-lactam derivatives (10a and 10b) were the most antimicrobial. The increase in the antimicrobial activity of 10a compared to 1a ranged from nearly 3.5-fold (C. albicans) to 43-fold (S. aureus). The mean +/- standard deviation for the zone of inhibition (mm) for 10a (C. albicans) was 31.9 +/- 4.3 and that for S. aureus was 51.1 +/- 2.9. Although (-)-alpha-pinene 1b was not active toward the test microorganisms, the corresponding beta-lactam 10b, amino ester 13b, and amino alcohol 14b showed antimicrobial activity toward the test microorganisms. The increase in the antimicrobial activity of 10b compared to 1b ranged from 32-fold (S. aureus) to 73-fold (M. luteus). The mean +/- standard deviation for the zone of inhibition (mm) for 10b (S. aureus) was 32.0 +/- 0.60 and that for M. luteus was 73.2 +/- 0.30.
TI  - Amphiphilic cationic beta(3R3)-peptides: membrane active peptidomimetics and their potential as antimicrobial agents.
AB  - We introduce a novel class of membrane active peptidomimetics, the amphiphilic cationic beta(3R3)-peptides, and evaluate their potential as antimicrobial agents. The design criteria, the building block and oligomer synthesis as well as a detailed structure-activity relationship (SAR) study are reported. Specifically, infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS) was employed to investigate structural features of amphiphilic cationic beta(3R3)-peptide sequences at the hydrophobic/hydrophilic air/liquid interface. Furthermore, Langmuir monolayers of anionic and zwitterionic phospholipids have been used to model the interactions of amphiphilic cationic beta(3R3)-peptides with prokaryotic and eukaryotic cellular membranes in order to predict their membrane selectivity and elucidate their mechanism of action. Lastly, antimicrobial activity was tested against Gram-positive M. luteus and S. aureus as well as against Gram-negative E. coli and P. aeruginosa bacteria along with testing hemolytic activity and cytotoxicity. We found that amphiphilic cationic beta(3R3)-peptide sequences combine high and selective antimicrobial activity with exceptionally low cytotoxicity in comparison to values reported in the literature. Overall, this study provides further insights into the SAR of antimicrobial peptides and peptidomimetics and indicates that amphiphilic cationic beta(3R3)-peptides are strong candidates for further development as antimicrobial agents with high therapeutic index.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of water-soluble gold(I) N-heterocyclic carbene complexes.
AB  - The antibacterial properties of water-soluble gold(I) complexes [1-methyl-3-(3-sulfonatopropyl)imidazol-2-ylidene]gold(I) chloride (C1), [1-mesityl-3-(3-sulfonatopropyl)imidazol-2-ylidene]gold(I) chloride (C2), [1-(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-3-(3-sulfonatopropyl)imidazol-2-ylidene]gold(I) chloride (C3) and [1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropyl-4-sodiumsulfonatophenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene]gold(I) chloride (C4) and the respective ligands were assessed by agar diffusion and broth macrodilution methods against Gram-positives Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Micrococcus luteus and the Gram-negative bacteria Yersinia ruckeri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. Viability after treatments was determined by direct plate count. The bactericidal activity displayed by C1 and C3 was comparable to that of AgNO3.
TI  - Structure-activity study of macropin, a novel antimicrobial peptide from the venom of solitary bee Macropis fulvipes (Hymenoptera: Melittidae).
AB  - A novel antimicrobial peptide, designated macropin (MAC-1) with sequence Gly-Phe-Gly-Met-Ala-Leu-Lys-Leu-Leu-Lys-Lys-Val-Leu-NH2 , was isolated from the venom of the solitary bee Macropis fulvipes. MAC-1 exhibited antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, antifungal activity, and moderate hemolytic activity against human red blood cells. A series of macropin analogs were prepared to further evaluate the effect of structural alterations on antimicrobial and hemolytic activities and stability in human serum. The antimicrobial activities of several analogs against pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa were significantly increased while their toxicity against human red blood cells was decreased. The activity enhancement is related to the introduction of either l- or d-lysine in selected positions. Furthermore, all-d analog and analogs with d-amino acid residues introduced at the N-terminal part of the peptide chain exhibited better serum stability than did natural macropin. Data obtained by CD spectroscopy suggest a propensity of the peptide to adopt an amphipathic alpha-helical secondary structure in the presence of trifluoroethanol or membrane-mimicking sodium dodecyl sulfate. In addition, the study elucidates the structure-activity relationship for the effect of d-amino acid substitutions in MAC-1 using NMR spectroscopy.
TI  - Campechic acids A and B: anti-invasive polyether polyketides from a soil-derived  Streptomyces.
AB  - Campechic acids A (1) and B (2), two new polyketides, were isolated from the culture extract of Streptomyces sp., and their structures were determined by NMR and MS spectroscopic analysis. Campechic acids are polyether-polyketides functionalized by two tetrahydrofuran rings, an enolized 1,3-diketone, and multiple methyl substitutions. Absolute configuration of nine stereogenic centers in 1, except for four chiral centers in the cyclic ether moieties, was determined by the 1H NMR anisotropy method in combination with chemical degradation. Campechic acids exhibited potent inhibitory effects on tumor cell invasion with IC50 values in the nanomolar to submicromolar range.
TI  - Plantaricin LD1: a bacteriocin produced by food isolate of Lactobacillus plantarum LD1.
AB  - Plantaricin LD1, a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus plantarum LD1, was characterized for biochemical and antimicrobial properties. Bacteriocin showed stability at high temperatures (100 degrees C for 20 min and 121 degrees C for 15 min under 15 psi pressure), in a pH range of 2.0-8.0 and also in the presence of organic solvents, surfactants and detergents. The crude preparation was not affected by catalase, amylase and lipase but activity was reduced in the presence of pepsin, trypsin and proteinase K showing proteinaceous nature of the compound. The molecular weight of bacteriocin was found to be approximately 6.5 kDa, and antimicrobial activity was confirmed by bioassay. It inhibited not only related strains but also other Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria such as Lactobacillus curvatus NRRL B-4562, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis NRRL B-1821, Enterococcus faecium NRRL B-2354, Enterobacter cloacae NRRL B-14298, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, urogenic Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri and Vibrio sp. These properties of plantaricin LD1 suggest its applications not only in food safety but in therapeutics as well.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of polyacrylonitrile-chitosan electrospun nanofibers.
AB  - Polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-chitosan double-face films and nanofibers were manufactured. PAN and a chitosan salt were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, and then thin-layered on a glass plate or electro-spun followed by coagulation in sodium hydroxide solution. The morphology of the PAN-chitosan double-face films and nanofibers was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. The thermal behavior and the glass transition temperature of PAN-chitosan blends were assessed by differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic mechanical analysis, respectively. The antibacterial efficacy was measured by a swatch test with bacterial suspensions. The PAN-chitosan nanofibers produced a 5-log reduction against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Micrococcus luteus.
TI  - Evaluating the antimicrobial activity of methonolic extract of rhus succedanea leaf gall.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The worldwide increased bacterial resistance to antibiotics and the undesirable side effects associated with constant use of synthetic drugs has prompted the search for novel antimicrobial agents, particularly those manufactured from plants. This study is designed to ascertain the antibacterial potential of Rhus succedanea leaf gall extracts on the growth of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. METHODS: The methanolic and hexane extract of different concentrations (100, 250, and 500 mug/ml) were prepared and their antibacterial efficacy was tested against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus using agar well diffusion method and the size of inhibition zone was measured in millimeters. RESULTS: The methanol and hexane extracts differed significantly in their antimicrobial activity with methanol extract showing a potent inhibitory activity in the range of 16+/-2 to 23+/-1, which was almost equal to the values of ciprofloxacin (25+/-3), used as a standard. Further, the methanol extract was mostly potent and effective in inhibiting the growth of gram-negative bacteria, namely, E. coli, when compared to gram -positive bacteria stains, which are responsible for antimicrobial activities. The phytochemical screening showed positive results for the presence of steroids, triterpenes, alkaloids, and carbohydrates. CONCLUSION: The potent antibacterial activity of Rhus succedanea leaf gall extracts indicates its useful therapeutic application against bacterial infection. Furthermore, this study indicates that the extract might be exploited as natural drug for the treatment of infectious diseases and could be useful in understanding the relations between traditional cures and current medications.
TI  - Oleamycins A and B: new antibacterial cyclic hexadepsipeptides isolated from a terrestrial Streptomyces sp.
AB  
TI  - Antimicrobial function of the GAPDH-related antimicrobial peptide in the skin of  skipjack tuna, Katsuwonus pelamis.
AB  - A 3.4 kDa of antimicrobial peptide was purified from an acidified skin extract of skipjack tuna, Katsuwonus pelamis, by preparative acid-urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and C18 reversed-phase HPLC. A comparison of the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified peptide with that of other known polypeptides revealed high sequence homology with the YFGAP (Yellowfin tuna Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-related Antimicrobial Peptide); thus, this peptide was identified as the skipjack tuna GAPDH-related antimicrobial peptide (SJGAP). SJGAP showed potent antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, such as Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus iniae (minimal effective concentrations [MECs], 1.2-17.0 mug/mL), Gram-negative bacteria, such as Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli D31, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus (MECs, 3.1-12.0 mug/mL), and against Candida albicans (MEC, 16.0 mug/mL) without significant hemolytic activity. Antimicrobial activity of this peptide is heat-stable but salt-sensitive. According to the secondary structural prediction and the homology modeling, this peptide consists of three secondary structural motifs, including one alpha-helix and two parallel beta-strands, and forms an amphipathic structure. This peptide showed neither membrane permeabilization ability nor killing ability, but did display a small degree of leakage ability. These results suggest that SJGAP acts through a bacteriostatic process rather than bactericidal one. SJGAP is another GAPDH-related antimicrobial peptide isolated from skipjack tuna and likely plays an important role for GAPDH in the innate immune defense of tuna fish.
TI  - Regioselective synthesis of 3-benzyl substituted pyrimidino chromen-2-ones and evaluation of anti-microbial and anti-biofilm activities.
AB  - Regioselective synthesis of a number of highly functionalized 3-benzylpyrimidino  chromen-2-ones (4) were accomplished in a one pot three component reaction in acetic acid and determined their anti-microbial and anti-biofilm activities. Compounds 4o and 4p showed an excellent anti-microbial activity against Micrococcus luteus MTCC 2470 at a par with standard control (Ciprofloxacin) and exhibited best activity against Staphylococcus aureus MTCC 96 and Bacillus subtilis MTCC 121. Further, compounds 4h, 4i, 4m, 4n and 4q showed promising activity against Micrococcus luteus MTCC 2470, Staphylococcus aureus MTCC 96 and Bacillus subtilis MTCC 121. Whereas, compounds 4m showed very promising biofilm inhibition activity against Staphylococcus aureus MLS 16 MTCC 2940 and 4o, 4p showed very potent activity against Staphylococcus aureus MTCC 96 at a par with Ciprofloxacin used as standard control.
TI  - Taguchi's experimental design for optimizing the production of novel thermostable polypeptide antibiotic from Geobacillus pallidus SAT4.
AB  - Polypeptide antimicrobials used against topical infections are reported to obtain from mesophilic bacterial species. A thermophilic Geobacillus pallidus SAT4 was isolated from hot climate of Sindh Dessert, Pakistan and found it active against Micrococcus luteus ATCC 10240, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Bacillus subtilis NCTC 10400 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 49189. The current experiment was designed to optimize the production of novel thermostable polypeptide by applying the Taguchi statistical approach at various conditions including the time of incubation, temperature, pH, aeration rate, nitrogen, and carbon concentrations. There were two most important factors that affect the production of antibiotic including time of incubation and nitrogen concentration and two interactions including the time of incubation/pH and time of incubation/nitrogen concentration. Activity was evaluated by well diffusion assay. The antimicrobial produced was stable and active even at 55 degrees C. Ammonium sulphate (AS) was used for antibiotic recovery and it was desalted by dialysis techniques. The resulted protein was evaluated through SDS-PAGE. It was concluded that novel thermostable protein produced by Geobacillus pallidus SAT4 is stable at higher temperature and its production level can be improved statistically at optimum values of pH, time of incubation and nitrogen concentration the most important factors for antibiotic production.
TI  - Estimation of flavoniods, antimicrobial, antitumor and anticancer activity of Carissa opaca fruits.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Carissa opaca Stapf ex Hanes fruits is traditionally used in the treatment of asthma, hepatitis and microbial infections. The present study was arranged to investigate the antimicrobial, cytotoxic and antitumor activity of various fractions of C. opaca extract and its bioactive metabolites responsible for that activity. METHODS: To characterize various fractions of C.opaca antibacterial, antifungal, cytotoxic and antitumor assays are used. Eight strains of bacteria including Bacillus subtilis, Enterobactor aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Salmonella typhy, and Staphylococcus aureus and four strains of fungal viz: Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger and Fusarium solani are used. Brine shrimps and potato dics are used for anticancer and antitumor potency of extract. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is utilized for determination of bioactive metabolites responsible for the activity. RESULTS: HPLC chromatogram revealed the presence of orientin, isoquercetin, myricetin and apigenin. Various fractions of C. oapca showed significant antibacterial, antitumor and anticancer activity. In case of C. opaca fruit inhibition growth of Aspergillus niger was ranged between 23.2 +/- 1.36% to 43.3 +/- 2.39%, Aspergillus flavus ranged between 27.6 +/- 1.39% to 65.6 +/- 3.44%, Aspergillus fumigatus ranged between 13.2 +/- 1.00% to 52.4 +/- 1.54% and Fusarium solani ranged between 10.5 +/- 1.02% to 14.6 +/- 1.74%. CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that, various fractions of C.opaca are accessible source of ethno pharmacy as they are consumed in different areas of Pakistan with ultimate health compensations.
TI  - Evaluation of antibacterial properties of Barium Zirconate Titanate (BZT) nanoparticle.
AB  - So far, the antibacterial activity of some organic and inorganic compounds has been studied. Barium zirconate titanate [Ba(ZrxTi(1)-x)O(3)] (x = 0.05) nanoparticle is an example of inorganic materials. In vitro studies have provided evidence for the antibacterial activity of this nanoparticle. In the current study, the nano-powder was synthesized by sol-gel method. X-ray diffraction showed that the powder was single-phase and had a perovskite structure at the calcination temperature of 1000 degrees C. Antibacterial activity of the desired nanoparticle was assessed on two gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus PTCC1431 and Micrococcus luteus PTCC1625) and two gram-negative (Escherichia coli HP101BA 7601c and clinically isolated Klebsiella pneumoniae) bacteria according to Radial Diffusion Assay (RDA). The results showed that the antibacterial activity of BZT nano-powder on both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was acceptable. The minimum inhibitory concentration of this nano-powder was determined. The results showed that MIC values for E. coli, K. pneumoniae, M. luteus and S. aureus were about 2.3 mug/mL, 7.3 mug/mL, 3 mug/mL and 12 mug/mL, respectively. Minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) was also evaluated and showed that the growth of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, M. luteus and S. aureus could be decreased at 2.3, 14, 3 and 18 mug/mL of BZT. Average log reduction in viable bacteria count in time-kill assay ranged between 6 Log(1)(0) cfu/mL to zero after 24 h of incubation with BZT nanoparticle.
TI  - Capillary electrophoresis of microbial aggregates.
AB  - Uncontrolled aggregation of bacterial cells is a significant disadvantage of electrophoretic separations. Various aspects of the electrophoretic behavior of different strains of Gram-positive Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Sarcina lutea, Staphylococcus aureus(1), and Micrococcus luteus bacteria and Gram-negative Escherichia coli bacteria were investigated in this study. Our findings indicate that bacteria can be rapidly analyzed by CZE with surface charge modification by calcium ions (Ca(2+)). Bound Ca(2+) ions increase zeta potential to more than 2.0 mV and significantly reduce repulsive forces. Under the above conditions, bacterial cells create compact aggregates, and fewer high-intensity signals are observed in electropherograms. The above can be attributed to the bridging effect of Ca(2+) between bacterial cells. CE was performed to analyze bacterial aggregates in an isotachophoretic mode. A single peak was observed in the electropherogram.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of resin rich plant extracts.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The in vitro antibacterial activity of resin rich methanolic extracts (RRMEs) of Commiphora myrrha, Operculina turpethum, and Pinus roxburghii. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Different concentration were studied by agar-well diffusion method against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis) and Gram-negative bacterial strains (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysenteriae). RESULTS: Among all the bacterial strains tested, E. faecalis was most sensitive and S. typhi was resistant to C. myrrha and P. roxburghii. The extracts of O. turpethum were active against all tested strains in which B. subtilis and S. aureus were the most sensitive. CONCLUSION: This suggested that the antibacterial activity of RRMEs of O. turpethum was more than C. myrrha and P. roxburghii. This probably explains the potential of these plants against a number of infections caused by bacterial strains tested.
TI  - Mutational analysis of positively charged residues in the N-terminal region of the class IIa bacteriocin pediocin PA-1.
AB  - The significance of positively charged residues for the target cell binding of pediocin PA-1 bacteriocins was studied by site-directed mutagenesis. Most of the charged residues are located in the N-terminal half of the peptide, which is thought to mediate the initial binding of these bacteriocins to their target cells through electrostatic interactions. Mutated peptides in which the positively charged residues were substituted or increased in number were constructed, and some of these peptides exhibited a twofold increase in the bacteriostatic activity. The greatest enhancement was achieved by introduced the positive charges at position 13, their results show the benefits of introducing an additional cationic residue within this patch in the middle of the N-terminal half of pediocin PA-1 bacteriocins. Thus, the presence of additional cationic residues in the N-terminal half influenced the electrostatic binding of this bacteriocin to its target cells and increased the potency of the peptide on the potency of Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus aureus. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: No previous work has systematically examined the N-terminal cationic residues of the pediocin PA-1 for their functional importance or redundancy. In this study, we examined the structure-function relationships of pediocin PA-1 by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutated peptides in which the positively charged residues were substituted and increased in number exhibited a twofold increase in the bacteriostatic activity. This study demonstrated the importance of the cationic patch in the N-terminal half of pediocin PA-1. The cationic residues influenced the electrostatic binding of the bacteriocin to the target cells and had a greater effect on the potency of the peptide towards Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of antihypertensive food-derived peptides and selected alanine analogues.
AB  - This study evaluated four food-derived peptides with known antihypertensive activities for antimicrobial activity against pathogenic microorganisms, and assessed structure-function relationships using alanine analogues. The peptides (EVSLNSGYY, barley; PGTAVFK, soybean; TTMPLW, alpha-casein; VHLPP, alpha-zein) and the six alanine substitution peptides of PGTAVFK were synthesised, characterised and evaluated for antimicrobial activity using the bacteria, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Micrococcus luteus and the yeast, Candida albicans. The peptides TTMPLW and PGTAVFK inhibited growth of all four microorganisms tested, with activities of a similar order of magnitude to ampicillin and ethanol controls. EVSLNSGYY inhibited the growth of the bacteria, but VHLPP showed no antimicrobial activity. The alanine analogue, PGAAVFK showed the highest overall antimicrobial activity and PGTAVFA showed no activity; overall, the activities of the analogues were consistent with their structures. Some peptides with antihypertensive activity also show antimicrobial activity, suggesting that food-derived peptides may exert beneficial effects via a number of mechanisms.
TI  - Antimicrobial and free radical scavenging activities of five Palestinian medicinal plants.
AB  - Extracts from five indigenous Palestinian medicinal plants including Rosmarinus officinalis, Pisidium guajava, Punica granatum peel, grape seeds and Teucrium polium were investigated for antimicrobial and free radical scavenging activities against eight microorganisms, using well diffusion method. The microorganisms included six bacterial isolates (i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginos, Klebsiella pneumonia, Bacillus subtilis and Micrococcus luteus) and two fungal isolates (i.e. Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger). A standard antioxidant assay was performed on the plant extracts to assess their capability in scavenging 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). Of the five tested plant extract, only Rosmarinus offcinalis extract contained significant antimicrobial activity against all eight microbial isolates including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Extracts from other four plants exhibited a variable antimicrobial activity against all microorganisms, except Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Significant antioxidant activity was detected in all plant extracts. However, extracts from Pisidium guajava leaves contained significantly higher antioxidant activity compared to the other extracts tested. The antimicrobial and scavenging activities detected in this in vitro study in extracts from the five Palestinian medicinal plants suggest that further study is needed to identify active compounds to target diseases caused by a wide-spectrum pathogens.
TI  - The presence of antibiotic-resistant nosocomial pathogens in endotracheal tube biofilms and corresponding surveillance cultures.
AB  - Mechanically ventilated patients often develop ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Soon after intubation, a mixed biofilm harboring microbial pathogens is formed on the endotracheal tube (ET). It is believed that this biofilm contributes to the development of VAP. Unfortunately, the causative agent is often not known at the time VAP is suspected, and early therapy often relies on the identification of surveillance cultures (SC). It is thus important to know whether these SC can predict the microbial flora in ET biofilms. In this study, we compare the presence of a number of antibiotic-resistant nosocomial bacteria (Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and of Candida albicans in cultures from ET biofilms and SC (i.e. sputum samples, nose swabs, and throat swabs) of 20 mechanically ventilated patients. Our data indicate that there is a good correlation between the presence of (antibiotic-resistant) pathogens in ET biofilms and SC.
TI  - Development of an informatics platform for therapeutic protein and peptide analytics.
AB  - The momentum gained by research on biologics has not been met yet with equal thrust on the informatics side. There is a noticeable lack of software for data management that empowers the bench scientists working on the development of biologic therapeutics. SARvision|Biologics is a tool to analyze data associated with biopolymers, including peptides, antibodies, and protein therapeutics programs. The program brings under a single user interface tools to filter, mine, and visualize data as well as those algorithms needed to organize sequences. As part of the data-analysis tools, we introduce two new concepts: mutation cliffs and invariant maps. Invariant maps show the variability of properties when a monomer is maintained constant in a position of the biopolymer. Mutation cliff maps draw attention to pairs of sequences where a single or limited number of point mutations elicit a large change in a property of interest. We illustrate the program and its applications using a peptide data set collected from the literature.
TI  - Developing a microbiological growth inhibition screening assay for the detection  of 27 veterinary drugs from 13 different classes in animal feedingstuffs.
AB  - Many regulations prohibit using veterinary drugs in feedingstuffs to protect consumers and animals alike. Within this investigation we developed a simple, cost-efficient primary screening method for detecting antibiotics and coccidiostats in animal feeds. Thirty-two veterinary drugs were originally considered. Following matrix-free testing to optimise detection, an assay based on matrix extraction with methanol/acetonitrile/phosphate buffer followed by inoculation and diffusion in agar plates was developed. Final validation was performed with 14 representative drugs (one per drug class) and four bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC11303 and ATCC27166, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC6538P, Micrococcus luteus ATCC9341) in bovine, lamb and swine fodder, measuring growth inhibition zones. Of the original drugs tested, 27 remained detectable in feed matrices at or below 20 mg kg(-1). Of the 14 validated representatives, two had estimated minimum detectable concentrations of 10-11 mg kg(-1), others of 5 mg kg(-1) or lower, an earlier minimum European Union inclusion rate for many veterinary drugs. No significant matrix effect on inhibition zones was detected. Per cent wrong negative deviations ranged from 0% (nine of 14 compounds) to 20-27% (two of 14), while inter-day precision based on inhibition zones had relative standard deviations (RSDs) of 6-109% (mean of 40%). When setting a 1 mm inhibition zone, the maximum observed for negative controls, as a cut-off level, no false-positives were found. While not all targeted antibiotics were detectable in complex matrices, the majority of veterinary drugs were detected with reasonable sensitivity, indicating that this method could be suitable for screening feedingstuffs prior to further confirmatory investigation of positive findings such as by LC-MS/MS.
TI  - Production of peptide antibiotics by Bacillus sp. GU 057 indigenously isolated from saline soil.
AB  - A total of 112 soil samples were taken from differents areas of district D.I.Khan and Kohat (KPK) Pakistan and screened for production of antibiotics against the Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus aureus. Widest zone of inhibition (18mm) was produced by microorganism isolated from saline soil. The strain was later identified as Bacillus GU057 by standard biochemical assays. Maximum activity (18mm inhibition zone) was observed against Staphylococcus aureus after 48 hours of incubation at pH 8 and 4% concentration of glucose. The antibiotic was identified by autobiography as bacitracin. The Bacillus strain GU057 was confirmed as good peptide antibiotic producer and can effectively be indulged as biocontrol agent.
TI  - A C-type lectin (AiCTL-3) from bay scallop Argopecten irradians with mannose/galactose binding ability to bind various bacteria.
AB  - C-type lectins are a family of Ca(2+)-dependent carbohydrate-binding proteins playing crucial roles in innate immunity of vertebrates and invertebrates. In the present study, the cDNA of a C-type lectin with one carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) of 127 amino acids was cloned from bay scallop Argopecten irradians (designated AiCTL-3) by rapid amplification of cDNA end (RACE) techniques based on expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis. The mRNA transcripts of AiCTL-3 could be detected in all the tested tissues including hepatopancreas, gonad, adductor muscle, heart, hemocytes, mantle and gill, with the highest expression level in hepatopancreas. After the challenges with Vibrio anguillarum and Micrococcus luteus, the mRNA expression level of AiCTL-3 was obviously up-regulated and reached the maximum level at 9h (11.87fold, P<0.01, and 20.02-fold, P<0.05, respectively). The recombinant AiCTL-3 (designated as rAiCTL-3) could bind LPS, PGN, and glucan in vitro, but could not bind mannan. And it also bound Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus as well as Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and V. anguillarum. With a Ca(2+) binding site 2 EPN (Glu-Pro-Asn) motif, rAiCTL-3 could bind both mannose and galactose which was quite different from those in vertebrate. Meanwhile, it could significantly enhance the phagocytosis of scallop hemocytes in vitro. The results clearly suggested that AiCTL-3 could serve not only as a PRR participated in the immune response against various PAMPs and bacteria in non-self recognition via mannose/galactose binding specificity but an opsonin playing an important part in clearance of invaders.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of bayberry leaf extract for the preservation of large yellow croaker (Pseudosciaena crocea).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chemical preservatives have been widely used to keep large yellow croaker fresh. However, the potential harm to human health cannot be ignored. This study was undertaken to investigate the antimicrobial effect of bayberry leaf extract and to evaluate the efficacy of this natural product on the preservation of large yellow croaker. RESULTS: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of bayberry leaf extract against bacteria were 1.0 mg mL(-)(1) for Micrococcus luteus, 0.5 mg mL(-)(1) for Staphylococcus aureus, 0.25 mg mL(-)(1) for Escherichia coli, 0.5 mg mL(-)(1) for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 0.0625 mg mL(-)(1) for Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and 0.03125 mg mL(-)(1) for Listeria monocytogenes, respectively. This result was confirmed by the diameters of inhibition zone (DIZ) assay. Further studies showed that the bacterial growth was significantly retarded when large yellow croaker was pretreated with bayberry leaf extract (2 g L(-)(1)) compared to that in the control group. Moreover, the generation of total volatile basic nitrogenous compounds (TVB-N), ATP degradation products (K-value) and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) were significantly reduced compared to that in the control group. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that the shelf life of large yellow croaker can be extended when supplemented with bayberry leaf extract, which might have implications for natural preservatives.
TI  - Functional analysis of domain of unknown function (DUF) 1943, DUF1944 and von Willebrand factor type D domain (VWD) in vitellogenin2 in zebrafish.
AB  - Vitellogenin (Vg), the precursor of egg-yolk proteins in all oviparous organisms, shares a similar domain structure combination. In most cases, Vg contains the Vitellogenin_N domain, the domain of unknown function (DUF) 1943, and the von Willebrand factor type D domain (VWD), which are present in different forms of Vg from both vertebrates and invertebrates. Occasionally, a DUF1944 domain is also present in between DUF1943 and VWD in some Vg proteins of vertebrates. Recent studies have shown that Vg participates in immune defense of host with multiple functions. However, whether all Vg proteins encoded by different vg genes play an immune role is unknown. In addition, the correlation of different domains in Vg with the multiple immune functions remains completely unclear. Here we demonstrated clearly that recombinant proteins, rDUF1943, rDUF1944 and rVWD from zebrafish Vg2 interacted with both the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Micrococcus luteus and the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Vibrio anguillarum, as well as their signature components LTA and LPS. Moreover, both rDUF1943 and rDUF1944 promoted the phagocytosis of E. coli and S. aureus by carp macrophages. These suggest that both DUF1943 and DUF1944 as well as VWD may contribute to the function of Vg as a pattern recognition receptor, and DUF1943 and DUF1944 also contribute to the function of Vg as an opsonin. This study also opens a new angle for identification of function of genes of unknown function, which have the domains DUF1943 and DUF1944.
TI  - Activation of neutrophils by the two-component leukotoxin LukE/D from Staphylococcus aureus: proteomic analysis of the secretions.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is responsible for severe bacterial infections in hospitals and healthcare facilities. It produces single and bicomponent toxins (leukotoxins and hemolysins) that hinder innate immune function. Leukotoxin subunits bind to leukocyte cell membrane thus inducing transmembrane pores and subsequently, cell lysis. Leukotoxin LukE/D is a member of the bicomponent toxin family, but to date, no study concerning its involvement in host-pathogen interactions has been reported. In the present study, we performed the proteomic analysis of the secretions recovered after activation of human neutrophils by leukotoxin LukE/D. The neutrophil secretions were purified by RP-HPLC and different fractions were analyzed by Edman sequencing, LC-MS/MS, immunoblotted for chromogranin-derived peptides and further analyzed for antimicrobial properties. Proteomic analysis revealed that neutrophil secretions constitute a large number of proteins related with immune boosting mechanisms, proteolytic degradation, inflammatory process and antioxidant reactions.
TI  - Cytotoxic, antioxidant, antimicrobial properties and chemical composition of rose petals.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rosa rugosa petals are used for production of teas, jams, wines and juices. Despite the wide availability of rose cultivars, comprehensive information on petal chemical composition and healthful properties is still lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study was analysis of cytotoxic, antioxidant and antimicrobial activity and chemical composition of rugosa rose petals. RESULTS: Petals of R. rugosa were evaluated for their cytotoxic effect against cervical (HeLa) and breast cancer (T47D) cell lines and for antiradical activity (with DPPH*). As a result, significant cytotoxic (up to 100% of dead cells) and antiradical properties (IC(5)(0) 1.33-0.08 mg mg(-)(1) DPPH*) were demonstrated. Moreover, notable antimicrobial activity against eight bacterial (i.e. Staphylococcus. epidermidis, S. aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis) and two yeast strains (Candida. albicans, C. parapsilosis) was shown. Total phenolic, flavonoid, phenolic acid, tannin, carotenoid and polysaccharide content in petals was determined using spectrophotometric methods. Liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry was used to thoroughly analyze phenolic acids and flavonoid glycosides in the methanolic extract and fractions obtained after its separation. Five phenolic acids and six flavonoids previously not reported in the plant material were identified. CONCLUSION: This is the first such detailed report on chemical composition and biological activity of R. rugosa petals.
TI  - Central venous catheter infections in outpatients with pulmonary hypertension treated with continuous iloprost.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intravenous prostanoid therapy is one cornerstone of therapy for patients with pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension (PH). Long-term central venous catheters expose patients to infectious complications. OBJECTIVES: We report the incidence of catheter-related infection (CRI) and the spectrum of bacteria for ambulatory PH patients treated with iloprost via non-tunnelled central venous catheters from our Swiss referral centre in Zurich. METHODS: Data from 15 PH patients treated with intravenous iloprost between May 2000 and June 2012 were reviewed. RESULTS: We found 11 CRI in 4 cases by two different organisms. Pathogens found were Brevibacterium (55%), Micrococcus luteus (18%), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (9%) and Staphylococcus aureus (9%), as well as unusual organisms such as Agrobacterium tumefaciens or Delftia tsuruhatensis. The overall CRI rate was 1.28 per 1,000 catheter days, or 0.47 per year. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of CRI using long-term, non-tunnelled central venous catheters in PH patients treated with iloprost is low. Uncommon, rare pathogens causing CRI were found in a substantial number of patients.
TI  - Effective inhibition of bacterial respiration and growth by CuO microspheres composed of thin nanosheets.
AB  - This study describes the synthesis, characterization and biocidal potential of copper oxide micro-spheres composed of thin sheets (CuOMSs-Ths). Microscopic observations of synthesized CuOMSs-Ths revealed the clusters of thin sheets arranged in small flower like micro-spheres. Diameter of each micro-sphere was determined in the range of 2-3 mum, whereas the size of each sheet was approximately 80 nm. These micro-flowers like nanostructures were synthesized using copper nitrate hexahydrate and sodium hydroxide via solution process. The CuOMSs-Ths exhibited a broad-spectrum anti-bacterial activity involving significant growth inhibition of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus. The IC50 values of these engineered NPs against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and M. luteus were determined to be 195, 200, 131 and 184 mug/ml, respectively. Also, the respiration of Gram+ ve organisms (M. luteus and S. aureus) was inhibited significantly (p value < 0.005) at relatively lower concentrations of 12.5 and 50 mug/ml, respectively, as compared to the Gram- ve bacteria (E. coli and P. aeruginosa), where the growth inhibition occurred at a much greater concentration of 100 mug/ml. The results explicitly demonstrated anti-microbial activity of CuOMSs-Ths with a higher level of toxicity against the Gram+ ve vis-a-vis Gram- ve bacteria.
TI  - Skin-associated Bacillus, staphylococcal and micrococcal species from the house dust mite, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and bacteriolytic enzymes.
AB  - Dust mites produce bacteriolytic enzymes, one of which belongs to the NlpC/P60 superfamily comprising bacterial and fungal proteins. Whether this enzyme is derived from the mite or from mite-associated microbes is unclear. To this end, the bacteriology of mites per se, and carpet and mattress dust from a group of asthmatic children and their parents was investigated. Dust from parents' and children's mattresses yielded significantly more colony forming units compared with dust from their corresponding carpets. Zymography demonstrated some dusts contained bacteriolytic enzymes, and in nine of the twelve dust samples from three of five houses examined, a prominent bacteriolytic band was obtained that corresponded to the mite band, although in one home, other lytic bands were detected. Fifty bacterial isolates were obtained from surface-sterilised, commercially obtained Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus. 16S rRNA, tuf and rpoB gene sequencing of nine Gram-positive isolates identified them as Bacillus cereus, B. licheniformis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. capitis and Micrococcus luteus, known human skin commensals. 16S rRNA sequence homologies of four of the nine isolates identified as B. licheniformis formed a distinct phylogenetic cluster. All species secreted lytic enzymes during culture although the lytic profiles obtained differed between the rods and the cocci, and none of the bands detected corresponded to those observed in dust or mites. In conclusion, mites harbour a variety of bacterial species often associated with human skin and house dusts contain bacteriolytic enzymes that may be mite-derived. The identification of a novel cluster of B. licheniformis isolates suggests an ecological adaptation to laboratory-reared D. pteronyssinus. It remains to be determined whether the previously described mite-associated 14 K lytic enzyme is derived from a microbial source.
TI  - Antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of the essential oil and extracts of Zanthoxylum alatum grown in north-western Himalaya.
AB  - The essential oil obtained from the fresh leaves of Zanthoxylum alatum was analysed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Fourteen components were identified, and linalool (30.58%), 2-decanone (20.85%), beta -fenchol (9.43%), 2-tridecanone (8.86%), beta -phellandrene (5.99%), Sabinene (4.82%), and alpha -pinene (4.11%) were the main components. The EO and methanolic extract of Z. alatum exhibited potent antifungal activity against Alternaria alternata, Alternaria brassicae, and Curvularia lunata. The EO also showed significant antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Further, antimicrobial constituents of the EO were isolated by bioautography and preparative thin layer chromatography (PTLC) and identified as beta -fenchol and linalool using GC/MS analysis. In addition to this, the free radical scavenging activity and antioxidant potential of EO and methanolic extract/fractions of Z. alatum were also investigated using in vitro assays including scavenging ability against DPPH(*), reducing power and chelating ability on Fe(2+) ions. Our results demonstrate that Z. alatum could be used as a resource of antioxidant and antimicrobial compounds which may find applications in food and pesticide industries.
TI  - cgMolluscidin, a novel dibasic residue repeat rich antimicrobial peptide, purified from the gill of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas.
AB  - A 5.5 kDa antimicrobial peptide consisting of 55 amino acids, cgMolluscidin, was  purified from the acidified gill extract of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, by ion-exchange and C18 reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. By comparing the N-terminal amino acid sequences and the molecular weight of this peptide with those of other known antimicrobial peptides, it has been revealed that this peptide had no homology with any known peptides. cgMolluscidin showed potent antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive bacteria, including Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus (minimal effective concentrations [MECs]; 1.3-31.3 mug/mL), and Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus ([MECs]; 0.4-2.3 mug/mL), without hemolytic activity. However, cgMolluscidin did not show any significant activity against Candida albicans. The deduced amino acid sequence of the cgMolluscidin showed no hit in public protein databases, while the nucleotide sequence had a 99% homology (E value = 0) with only the unknown ESTs sequenced by C. gigas EST project. Tissue distribution of the cgMolluscidin mRNA suggests that it is constitutively expressed as a mature form in a non-tissue-specific manner. The cgMolluscidin mRNA expression level was significantly up-regulated at 12 h (2.8-fold) post injection with Vibrio sp. This peptide is highly basic and contains several dibasic residue repeats including Lysine-Lysine or Lysine-Arginine in the sequence, but may not form an ordered structure. These results suggest that cgMolluscidin might be an oyster-specific novel antimicrobial peptide.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial evaluation of some novel 1,2,4-triazole and 1,3,4-thiadiazole derivatives.
AB  - This study presents the synthesis and spectral analysis of new derivatives of 1,2,4-triazole-3-thione and 1,3,4-thiadiazole. New compounds were prepared by cyclization reaction of acyl thiosemicarbazide derivatives in the presence of alkaline and acidic media. All synthesized compounds were screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity by using the agar dilution technique. Six of the compounds had potential activity against Gram-positive bacteria (minimal inhibitory concentration [MIC] = 15.63-500 mug/mL). Some compounds showed good activity especially against Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 (MIC = 15.63-250 mug/mL), Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 (MIC = 31.25-250 mug/mL), and Micrococcus luteus ATCC 10240 (MIC = 125-250 mug/mL).
TI  - Sequences of metanicins, 20-residue peptaibols from the ascomycetous fungus CBS 597.80.
AB  - Four linear 20-residue peptaibols, named metanicins (MTCs) A-D, were isolated from submerged cultures of the ascomycetous fungus CBS 597.80. Structure elucidation was performed by a combination of fast-atom-bombardment mass spectrometry (FAB-MS), electrospray ionization MS, Edman degradation of isolated fragments, and amino acid analysis by ion-exchange and gas chromatography, and enantioselective HPLC. The sequences of MTC A(B) are (amino acid exchange in B and C in parentheses): Ac-Aib-Ala-Aib-Ala-Aib-Ala-Gln-Aib-Val-Aib-Gly-Leu-Aib-Pro-Val-Aib-Aib(D-Iva)-Gln -Gln-Pheol and of MTC C(D) Ac-Aib-Ala-Aib-Ala-Aib-Ala-Gln-Aib-Val-Aib-Gly-Leu-Aib-Pro-Val-Aib-Aib(D-Iva)-Gln -Gln-Pheol (Ac, acetyl; Aib, alpha-aminoisobutyric acid; Iva, isovaline; Pheol, L-phenylalaninol). The peptides are related, and some of the sequences are identical, to other 20-residue peptaibols isolated from Trichoderma species. MTCs show moderate activities against Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus, and very low activities against Bacillus subtilis. The producer has originally been identified and deposited as Metarhizium anisopliae var. anisopliae CBS 597.80. Although this identification has been withdrawn by Centralbureau voor Schimmelcultures (CBS) in the meantime, the accession number will be retained - independently from any taxonomic revisions.
TI  - Functional characterization of a short peptidoglycan recognition protein, PGRP5 in grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella.
AB  - Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs), which are evolutionarily conserved from insects to mammals, recognize bacterial peptidoglycan (PGN) and function in antibacterial innate immunity. In this study, a short-form PGRP, designated as gcPGRP5 was identified from grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella. The deduced amino acid sequence of gcPGRP5 is composed of 180 residues with a conserved PGRP domain at the C-terminus. The gcPGRP5 gene consists of four exons and three introns, spacing approximately 2.3 kb in genomic sequence. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the gcPGRP5 is clustered with other PGRP-S identified in teleost fish. The gcPGRP5 is constitutively expressed in all organs/tissues examined, and its expression was significantly induced in CIK cells treated with lipoteichoic acid (LTA), polyinosinic polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C) and PGN. Fluorescence analysis showed that gcPGRP5 is distributed in cytoplasm of CIK cells, and cell lysates from CIK cells transfected with pTurbo-gcPGRP5-GFP and ptGFP1-gcPGRP5 plasmids display the binding activity and peptidoglycan-lytic amidase activity toward Lys-PGN from Staphylococcus aureus and Dap-PGN from Bacillus subtilis. Furthermore, heat-shock protein70 (Hsp70), and MyD88, an adaptor molecule in Toll-like receptor pathway, had an increased expression in CIK cells overexpressed with gcPGRP5. It is thus indicated that gcPGRP5 exhibits amidase activity, and also possesses roles in anti-stress, and in Toll-like receptor signaling pathway.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro antimicrobial activity of 1-methyl-3-sulfonylthio-4-aminoquinolinium chlorides.
AB  - Synthesis and in vitro antimicrobial activity (MIC) of novel 1-methyl-3-sulfonylthio-4-aminoquinolinium chlorides 2 are described. Compounds 2 were obtained in the reaction of 1-methyl-4-aminoquinolinium 3-thiolates 1 with sulfonyl chlorides. Antimicrobial activity of compounds 2 was investigated using Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium pseudodiphtericum and Gram-negative Escherichia coil, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains as well as Candida albicans. The investigated compounds exhibited growth-inhibitory activity towards Gram-positive bacteria in the 4-64 microg/mL range whereas that towards Gram-negative bacteria covered the 128-1024 microg/mL range. The highest activity was shown by compound 2c, featuring a phenylsulfonylthio substituent in the 3-quinoline position and a 4-chlorophenylamine group in the position 4. All of the investigated compounds 2 showed antifungal activity in the 32-128 microg/mL range. Correlations between antimicrobial activity and chemical structure of the tested compounds were observed.
TI  - Site-directed mutations in the lanthipeptide mutacin 1140.
AB  - The oral bacterium Streptococcus mutans, strain JH1140, produces the antibiotic mutacin 1140. Mutacin 1140 belongs to a group of antibiotics called lanthipeptides. More specifically, mutacin 1140 is related to the epidermin type A(I) lanthipeptides. Mutagenesis experiments of this group of lanthipeptides have been primarily restricted to the posttranslationally modified meso-lanthionine and 3-methyllanthionine residues. Site-directed mutagenesis of the core peptide of mutacin 1140 was performed using the suicide vector pVA891. Substitutions of the N-terminal residue, the charged residue in the hinge region, and residues in ring A and intertwined rings C and D were investigated. A truncation and insertion of residues in ring A and intertwined rings C and D were also performed to determine whether or not they would alter the antimicrobial activity of the producing strain. Bioassays revealed that five of 14 mutants studied had improved antimicrobial activity against the indicator strain Micrococcus luteus ATCC 10240. MICs against Streptococcus mutans UA159, Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 27336, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Clostridium difficile UK1, and Micrococcus luteus ATCC 10240 were determined for three mutacin 1140 variants that had the most significant increases in bioactivity in the M. luteus bioassay. This mutagenesis study of the epidermin group of lanthipeptides shows that antimicrobial activity can be significantly improved.
TI  - Antibacterial Activity of the Alkaloid-Enriched Extract from Prosopis juliflora Pods and Its Influence on in Vitro Ruminal Digestion.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the in vitro antimicrobial activity of alkaloid-enriched extracts from Prosopis juliflora (Fabaceae) pods in order to evaluate them as feed additives for ruminants. As only the basic chloroformic extract (BCE), whose main constituents were juliprosopine (juliflorine), prosoflorine and juliprosine, showed Gram-positive antibacterial activity against Micrococcus luteus (MIC = 25 mug/mL), Staphylococcus aureus (MIC = 50 mug/mL) and Streptococcus mutans (MIC = 50 mug/mL), its influence on ruminal digestion was evaluated using a semi-automated in vitro gas production technique, with monensin as the positive control. Results showed that BCE has decreased gas production as efficiently as monensin after 36 h of fermentation, revealing its positive influence on gas production during ruminal digestion. Since P. juliflora is a very affordable plant, this study points out this alkaloid enriched extract from the pods of Prosopis juliflora as a potential feed additive to decrease gas production during ruminal digestion.
TI  - Green synthesis of silver nanoparticles from leaf extract of Mimusops elengi, Linn. for enhanced antibacterial activity against multi drug resistant clinical isolates.
AB  - Green synthesis of metallic silver nanoparticles has attracted nowadays and alternative to physical and chemical approaches. In the present study, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were synthesized from leaf extract of Mimusops elengi, L. at room temperature. Formation of stable AgNPs at 1mM concentrations of silver nitrate (AgNO3) typically gave spherical shape particles with diameter range from 55 to 83nm. The kinetic properties of particle formation were proportional to the effect of concentration of AgNO3 solution. In order to identify the compounds responsible for the bioreduction of Ag(+) ion and the stabilization of AgNPs produced, the functional group present in Mimusops elengi, L. leaf extract was investigated using FTIR. The formation of nanoparticle was confirmed using the surface plasmon resonance band shown in UV-vis spectrophotometer. The topography and morphology of the particles were determined using scanning electron microscopy. The crystalline nature of nanoparticles was confirmed from the XRD pattern. Furthermore these green synthesized AgNPs were found to show higher antimicrobial efficacy against multi drug resistant clinical isolates.
TI  - Co-production of surfactin and a novel bacteriocin by Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis H4 isolated from Bikalga, an African alkaline Hibiscus sabdariffa seed fermented condiment.
AB  - Bikalga is a Hibiscus sabdariffa seed fermented condiment widely consumed in Burkina Faso and neighboring countries. The fermentation is dominated by Bacillus subtilis group species. Ten B. subtilis subsp. subtilis (six isolates) and Bacillus licheniformis (four isolates) isolated from traditional Bikalga were examined for their antimicrobial activity against a panel of 36 indicator organisms including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and yeasts. The Bacillus spp. isolates showed variable inhibitory abilities depending on the method used. Both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were inhibited in the agar spot assay while only Gram-positive pathogens were inhibited in the agar well diffusion assay. Cell free supernatants (CFS) of pure cultures of 3 B. subtilis subsp. subtilis (G2, H4 and F1) strains inhibited growth of Listeria monocytogenes, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus, while CFS of 2 B. licheniformis (E3 and F9) strains only inhibited M. luteus. The antimicrobial substance(s) produced by B. subtilis subsp. subtilis H4 was further characterized. The antimicrobial substance(s) produced by H4 was detected from mid-exponential growth phase. The activity was sensitive to protease and trypsin, but resistant to the proteolytic action of proteinase K and papain. Treatment with alpha-amylase and lipase II resulted in a complete loss of antimicrobial effect, indicating that a sugar moiety and lipid moiety are necessary for the activity. Treatment with mercapto-ethanol resulted in a significant loss, indicative of the presence of disulfide bridges. The antimicrobial activity of H4 was heat resistant and active at pH3-10. PCR detection of yiwB, sboA, spoX, albA and spaS, etnS genes and genes coding for surfactins and plipastatins (fengycins) indicated a potential for subtilosin, subtilin and lipopeptide production, respectively. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was carried out and a single band of approximately 4kDa had antimicrobial activity. Ultra high performance liquid chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-TOFMS) analysis of the 4kDa band allowed identification of surfactin and a protein with a monoisotopic mass of 3346.59Da, which is dissimilar in size to subtilosin and subtilin. Surfactin is a cyclic lipoheptapeptide, which contains a beta-hydroxy fatty acid, but no di-sulfide bridges or sugar residues. The complete loss of activity upon amylase treatment indicates that surfactin was not responsible for the observed antimicrobial effect. However, it cannot completely be ruled out that surfactin acts synergistically with the detected protein, though further investigations are needed to confirm this.
TI  - New alkaloid from Streptomyces koyangensis residing in Odontotermes formosanus.
AB  - A new alkaloid was isolated from the ethyl acetate extract of the culture of a termite-associated Streptomyces koyangensis BY-4. The structure of 1 was elucidated by using MS, NMR, electronic circular dichroism data, and computational approaches. Compound 1 showed weak antimicrobial activities against a panel of test microbes.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and phytochemical screening of Buchenavia tetraphylla (Aubl.) R. A. Howard (Combretaceae: Combretoideae).
AB  - This study evaluated the antimicrobial and hemolytic activities and phytochemical constituents of hydroalcoholic extract and its fractions from Buchenavia tetraphylla leaves. Cyclohexane (BTCF), ethyl acetate (BTEF), and n-butanol-soluble (BTSBF) and non-soluble (BTNBF) fractions were obtained from a liquid-liquid partition of hydroalcoholic extract (BTHE) from B. tetraphylla leaves. The hemolytic activity of active fractions was checked. The BTHE inhibited the growth of Micrococcus luteus (MIC: 0.10 mg/mL), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC: 0.20 mg/mL), Mycobacterium smegmatis (MIC: 0.39 mg/mL), Proteus vulgaris, and Staphylococcus aureus (MIC: 0.78 mg/mL for both). The more active fractions were BTCF and BTBSF. BTCF showed better potential to inhibit M. luteus (0.10 mg/mL), P. aeruginosa (0.20 mg/mL), S. enteritidis (0.39 mg/mL), and S. aureus (1.56 mg/mL). BTBSF showed the best results for M. luteus (0.10 mg/mL), M. smegmatis, B. subtilis (0.39 mg/mL for both), and P. vulgaris (0.10 mg/mL). The HC50 were greater than observed MIC: 20.30, 4.70 and 2.53 mg/mL, respectively, to BTBF, BTHE and BTCF, which. The phytochemical analysis detected the presence of flavanoids, triterpene, carbohydrate, and tannin. Our work showed for the first time the broad-spread antimicrobial activity of B. tetraphylla, which has nonhemolytic action, creating a new perspective on the interesting association of traditional and scientific knowledge.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro antibacterial activity of 5-halogenomethylsulfonyl- benzimidazole and benzotriazole derivatives.
AB  - A series of 5-halogenomethylsulfonylbenzimidazole and benzotriazole derivatives was synthesized as potential antibacterial agents. A new method of synthesis of benzimidazoles was developed. The antimicrobial activities of these compounds were tested against a series of reference and clinical strains. The reference strains include Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus, S. epidermidis, B. subtilis, B. cereus, E. hirae, M. luteus) and Gram-negative rods (E. coli, P. vulgaris, P. aeruginosa, B. bronchiseptica). The clinical strains include six methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and two methicillin-sensitive (MSSA) S. aureus strains, one methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, three E. faecalis and two E. faecium strains. Compound with trifluoromethyl- substituent at C-2 position (4) displayed significant antibacterial activities comparable with nitrofurantoin against four strains, and higher against Micrococcus luteus. MIC values for clinical Staphylococci strains (MRSA) were 12.5-25 mug/mL; for Enterococcus strains these values were 50-100 mug/mL. MIC values for reference and clinical strains of Staphylococcus and Enterococcus group were similar, respectively.
TI  - A four-CRD C-type lectin from Chlamys farreri mediating nonself-recognition with  broader spectrum and opsonization.
AB  - C-type lectins are a superfamily of Ca(2+)-dependent carbohydrate-recognition proteins consisting of at least one carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD), which participate in nonself-recognition and clearance of invaders. In invertebrate, some multidomain C-type lectins have been identified, but their relative functions and binding mechanism are still meager. In the present study, A C-type lectin (CfLec-4) with four CRDs from Chlamys farreri was selected to investigate its possible function in innate immunity. The mRNA expression of CfLec-4 in hemocytes was significantly up-regulated (P<0.01) after the stimulations of beta-glucan, LPS or PGN, and reached the highest expression level at 3, 6, 12 h post-stimulation, which was 27.9-, 22.6- or 47.9-fold of that in blank group, respectively. Immunohistochemistry assay with polyclonal antibody specific for CfLec-4 revealed that the endogenous CfLec-4 was mainly located in the hepatopancreas, kidney and gonad of the scallops. The recombinant CfLec-4 (rCflec-4) could bind LPS, PGN, glucan and mannose in vitro, but could not bind LTA. Furthermore, rCflec-4 displayed a broader bacteria binding spectrum towards Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus as well as Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Vibrio anguillarum and fungi Pichia pastoris. Meanwhile, rCfLec-4 could significantly (P<0.01) enhance the phagocytosis of hemocytes in vitro. The results clearly suggested that four-CRD containing CfLec-4 not only served as PRR with wider recognition spectrum, but also functioned as an opsonin participating in the clearance of invaders in scallops. It could be inferred that the diversity and complexity of CRDs in C-type lectins endowed these receptors with comprehensive recognition spectrum and multiple immune functions against complex living environment.
TI  - [Bactericidal effect of lysozyme].
AB  - Isolation of lysozyme from hemolymph of Alveonasus lahorensis (Acari: Parasitiformes, Argasidae) and Hyalomma marginatum (Acari: Parasitiformes, Ixodidae) with using ultrasound is described. It was shown that the bactericidal effect of the ultrasound-extracted lysozyme against Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus significantly exceeded that of the chicken egg lysozyme and lysozyme from ticks without ultrasound exposure. Disintegration of the hemolymph cells increased lysozyme production.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial and time-kill evaluation of the Erythrina caffra Thunb. extract against bacteria associated with diarrhoea.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of stem bark ethanolic extract of Erythrina caffra Thunb. against bacteria in diarrhoea was determined in vitro by the agar diffusion and dilution, macrobroth dilution, and time-kill assay methods. The result showed that the extract produced inhibition zones ranging between 15 +/- 1.0 mm and 23 +/- 1.0 mm, and the bacteria were susceptible at concentrations ranging between </=100 and </=1000 mug/mL. While the MICs of the extract ranged between 39.1 and 625 mug/mL, and the MBCs ranged between 78.1 and 625 mug/mL, the MICs of Micrococcus luteus, Proteus vulgaris CSIR 0030, Enterococcus faecalis KZN, and Staphylococcus aureus OK(3) were less than 100 mug/mL, and the mechanisms of antibiosis indicated that the crude ethanolic extract was highly bactericidal against the entire test bacteria isolates. In the time-kill assay, the average log reduction of the viable cell count ranged between 0.916 log(1)(0) and 1.851 log(1)(0) cfu/mL on incubating the bacteria for 4 h at the MICs, while the reduction ranged between 0.183 log(1)(0) and 1.105 log(1)(0) cfu/mL after 8 h of incubation. Incubating the bacteria for 4 h at 2 x MICs resulted in the reduction of the viable cell count to between -0.264 log(1)(0) and 0.961 log(1)(0) cfu/mL, while the average log reduction ranged between -3.968 log(1)(0) and -0.425 log(1)(0) cfu/mL after 8 h of incubation with Micrococcus luteus, Proteus vulgaris CSIR 0030, and Staphylococcus aureus OK(3) being the most highly affected bacteria. The result showed that the extract exhibited broader-spectrum antibacterial activity and justifies the use of Erythrina caffra in the folkloric medicine for treating gastrointestinal infections in South Africa.
TI  - Isolation, biochemical characterization, and cloning of a bacteriocin from the poultry-associated Staphylococcus aureus strain CH-91.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus strain CH-91, isolated from a broiler chicken with atopic dermatitis, has a highly proteolytic phenotype that is correlated with the disease. We describe the isolation and biochemical and molecular characterization of the AI-type lantibiotic BacCH91 from S. aureus CH-91 culture medium. The bacteriocin was purified using a three-stage procedure comprising precipitation with ammonium sulfate, extraction with organic solvents, and reversed-phase HPLC. The BacCH91 peptide is thermostable and highly resistant to cleavage by both prokaryotic and eukaryotic peptidases. The MIC for the Gram-positive bacteria ranged from 2.5 nM for Microococcus luteus through 1.3-6.0 muM for staphylococcal strains up to more than 100 muM for Lactococcus lactis. BacCH91 was ineffective against the Gram-negative strains tested at the maximal concentration (100 muM). The amino acid sequence of BacCH91 is similar to that of epidermin and gallidermin. The encoding gene (bacCH91) occurred in two allelic variants distinguishable in the restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. Variant I, identified in S. aureus CH-91, dominated in S. aureus strains of poultry origin, although strains with variant II were also identified in this group. S. aureus strains of human origin were characterized exclusively by variant II.
TI  - Nurses' uniforms: How many bacteria do they carry after one shift?
AB  - This pilot study investigated the pathogens that nurses are potentially bringing  into the public and their home when they wear work uniforms outside of the work environment. To achieve this, sterilized uniforms were distributed to 10 nurses at a local hospital in Washington State at the beginning of their shift. Worn uniforms were collected at the end of the shifts and sent to a laboratory for analysis. Four tests were conducted: 1) a heterotrophic growth plate count, 2) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) growth, 3) vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE), and 4) identification of the heterotrophic plate counts. Each participant completed a questionnaire and a survey. The results showed that the average bacteria colony growth per square inch was 1,246 and 5,795 for day and night shift, respectively. After 48 h, MRSA positives were present on 4 of the day shift and 3 of the night shift uniforms. Additional bacteria identified include: Bacillus sp., Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Micrococcus roseus. The significant presence of bacteria on the uniforms 48 h after the shift ended necessitates further study, discussions and policy consideration regarding wearing health care uniforms outside of the work environment.
TI  - Antifungal and antibacterial activity of the essential oil of Chamaecyparis lawsoniana from Spain.
AB  - The essential oils extracted from the young stems and leaves of Chamaecyparis lawsoniana (A.Murray) Parl. have been analysed by Gas Chromatography and Gas Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry. A total of 66 compounds were identified representing around the 99% of the total oil. The oil was richer in monoterpenes than in sesquiterpenes. The only main component was limonene with a percentage composition of 77.7%. The rest of compounds that contribute to the fragrance had percentage composition lower that the 3.0%: p-cymen-7-ol (3.0%), myrcene (2.4%), camphor (2.1%), delta-elemene (1.6%), oplopanonyl acetate (1.6%), methyl perillate (1.3%), terpinen-4-ol (1.0%) and beta-oplopenone 1.0%. The antibacterial and antifungal activity of this oil was also tested against different microorganisms. The only fungus tested, Candida albicans, was very sensitive to the treatment with an inhibition halos of 20mm. The oil was more effective with the Gram (+) than with Gram (-) bacteria. The inhibition halos were 12mm, 12-13mm and 12-13mm for Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus respectively. We report new data of the antibacterial and antifungal activity of the essential oil of this species. The essential oil of C. lawsoniana could be considered as a good natural antibacterial and antifungal agent.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of herbs and spices against bacterial pathogens.
AB  
TI  - Lipopeptide biosurfactants from Paenibacillus polymyxa inhibit single and mixed species biofilms.
AB  - Although biofilms are recognised as important in microbial colonisation, solutions to their inhibition are predominantly based on planktonic assays. These solutions have limited efficacy against biofilms. Here, a series of biofilm-orientated tests were used to identify anti-biofilm compounds from marine micro-flora. This led to the isolation of a complex of anti-biofilm compounds from an extract of Paenibacillus polymyxa (PPE). A combination of rpHPLC and mass spectrometry identified the principle components of PPE as fusaricidin B (LI-FO4b) and polymyxin D1, with minor contributions from surfactins. This complex (PPE) reduced the biofilm biomass of Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus bovis. In contrast, ampicillin was only effective against S. aureus. PPE also inhibited a self-assembling marine biofilm (SAMB) in co-incubation assays by 99.3% +/- 1.9 and disrupted established SAMB by 72.4% +/- 4.4, while ampicillin showed no significant reduction. The effectiveness of this complex of lipopeptides against single and multispecies biofilms suggests a future role in biofilm prevention strategies.
TI  - Comparison of the Staphylococcus QuickFISH BC test with the tube coagulase test performed on positive blood cultures for evaluation and application in a clinical routine setting.
AB  - Many studies demonstrate that delayed proper therapy in bloodstream infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus increases the mortality rate, emphasizing the need to shorten the turnaround time for positive blood cultures. Different techniques are currently available, from phenotypic methods to more complex tests such as matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF), real-time PCR (RT-PCR), and fluorescence in situ hybridization using peptide nucleic acid probes (PNA FISH). This study evaluated the performance of the Staphylococcus QuickFISH BC test (QFT), a novel FISH methodology, compared with the direct tube coagulase test (DTCT) on blood cultures exhibiting Gram-positive cocci in clusters. A total of 173 blood cultures collected from 128 different patients were analyzed using the DTCT, evaluated after both 4 and 24 h, and the QFT. A total of 179 isolates were identified using the Vitek2 system. Thirty-five out of 35 Staphylococcus aureus were correctly identified by the QFT (sensitivity = 100%), with a specificity of 100% (no green fluorescence was detected for strains different from S. aureus). The DTCT was positive after 4 h for 28 out of the 35 samples (sensitivity = 80%) and after 24 h for 31 out of the 35 samples (sensitivity = 88.57%). Among the remaining 144 isolates, one was then identified as Corynebacterium striatum and two as Micrococcus luteus. QFT identified 139 out of the 141 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (sensitivity = 98.58%), showing again a specificity of 100% (no fluorescent red signals were detected for strains different from CoNS). We also discuss also the implementation process of this methodology in our setting, with particular emphasis on the workflow and the cost-effectiveness.
TI  - Development of bacteria identification array to detect lactobacilli in Thai fermented sausage.
AB  - To improve the quality and safety of food products, there is a need in the food industry for a reliable method for simultaneously monitoring multiple bacterial strains. Microarray technology is a high-throughput screening approach that can provide an alternative for bacteria detection. A total of 164 bacteria-specific probes were designed from 16S rRNA gene sequences to target 12 bacteria species, including lactic acid bacteria and selected food pathogens. After fabrication onto aminosilane-coated slides, hybridization conditions of the array were optimized for high specificity and signal intensities. The array was applied to detect 12 bacteria individually and was specific to all (Lactobacillus plantarum group, L. fermentum, L. brevis, L. delbrueckii, L. casei, L. sakei, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus and Listeria monocytogenes) except L. animalis. Multiplex detection using mixed bacteria populations was evaluated and accurate detection was obtained. The feasibility of using the array to detect the target bacteria in food was evaluated with Thai fermented sausages (Nham). Meat samples were collected on days 2, 3 and 7 after natural fermentation, L. plantarum-inoculated fermentation and L. brevis-inoculated fermentation before applying to the array. The naturally-fermented Nham contained L. sakei, L. delbrueckii, L. plantarum and L. fermentum. The L. plantarum-inoculated Nham showed a similar lactic acid bacteria population but the positive signal level for L. plantarum was higher than with natural fermentation. The L. brevis-inoculated Nham contained L. brevis, L. plantarum, L. delbrueckii and L. fermentum. The array was used to monitor bacteria population dynamics during the fermentation process. The naturally-fermented and L. brevis-inoculated samples showed lower positive signal levels of L. plantarum on day 2, but signals gradually increased on days 3 and 7 of the fermentation. In contrast, the L. plantarum-started fermentation showed a higher positive signal level on day 2 than the natural and L. brevis-inoculated samples, and the positive signal level remained high on days 3 and 7. The bacteria identification array was proven to be useful as an alternative method to detect and monitor target bacteria populations during food fermentation.
TI  - Effects of parabens and isothiazolinone on the microbiological quality of baby shampoo: the challenge test.
AB  - An in vitro microbial challenge test has been developed to predict the likelihood of consumer contamination of baby shampoo. Four preservatives were tested in our study: the parbens Medcide D, Medcide PB, Sepicide HB. and isothiazolinone Methylisothiazolinone/Chloromethylisothiazolinone [MI/MCI]. These preservatives were tested separately and in combination. The challenge test involved inoculating the product with Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aspergillus brasiliensis and Candida albicans. Inhibition growth of these microorganisms at each preservative concentration was followed over a 28 d period. The test was used to classify products as poorly preserved, marginally preserved, or well-preserved. Interestingly, it was the combination (0.1% Isothiazolinone [MI/MCI] and 0.1% Sepicide HB) which inhibited most the microbial growth of microorganims while preserving the physicochemical properties of the product. As a result, the challenge test described can be accurately used to predict the risk of consumer contamination of cosmetic products.
TI  - A novel methylated sesquiterpene from seagrass Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile.
AB  - Phytochemical investigation of chloroform extract from the leaves of the marine plant Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile (Posidoniaceae), yielded posidozinol, a new methylated sesquiterpene along with beta-sitosterol and four known fatty acids: palmitic, palmitoleic, oleic and linoleic acids. The structure elucidation has been established on the basis of 1D- and 2D-NMR spectroscopy, GS/MS and ES mass spectrometry. Antibacterial effects of crude extracts from P. oceanica were evaluated against: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Micrococcus luteus microorganisms.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oil of different parts of Seseli rigidum.
AB  - The chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of the Balkan endemic species Seseli rigidum Waldst. & Kit. (Apiaceae) was investigated. The monoterpene alpha-pinene was predominant in the volatile oil from aerial parts (57.4%) and fruit (23.3%). In the essential oil of the aerial parts limonene (6.7%), camphene (5.8%) and sabinene (5.5%) were also present in high amounts, and in the fruit oil, beta-phellandrene (17.4%) and sabinene (12.9%). On the contrary, the root essential oil was composed almost entirely of the polyacetylene falcarinol (88.8%). The antimicrobial activity of the root essential oil was significant against Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus and Enterococcus faecalis (MICs 6.25-25.00 microg/mL). Volatile constituents from the root strongly inhibited the growth of methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus (MICs 6.25-50.00 microg/mL). Anti-staphylococcal activity can be attributed to the main volatile constituent ofS. rigidum root, falcarinol.
TI  - Crustins from eyestalk cDNA library of swimming crab Portunus trituberculatus: molecular characterization, genomic organization and expression analysis.
AB  - Crustins are cationic, cysteine-rich antimicrobial proteins, containing a single  whey acidic protein (WAP) domain in the C-terminal end. Different from the reported Ptcrustin in the hemocytes, two novel crustin genes (PtCrustin2 and PtCrustin3) were cloned completely from the eyestalk cDNA library of Portunus trituberculatus in this study. All PtCrustins share the consensus cysteine motif and are considered as Type I crustins. Four exons and three introns are identified in genomic DNA sequence of PtCrustin3 while three exons and two introns in PtCrustin2. The mRNA transcripts of PtCrustin2 and PtCrustin3 are mainly detected in eyestalk and gills, but not in hemocytes. Although both PtCrutins are up-regulated after challenge of three microorganisms, PtCrustin3 seems to respond more quickly to microbial challenge than Ptcrustin2. Unlike most crustins, both recombinant PtCrustin2 and PtCrustin3 exhibit antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria Micrococcus luteus and Staphyloccocus aureus and Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In addition, rPtCrustin2 is moderately active against yeast Pichia pastoris and rPtCrustin3 show significant activity against Gram-negative bacterium Vibrio alginolyticus. These results indicate that PtCrustin2 and PtCrustin3 are two novel crustins and play different roles in immune response of P. trituberculatus against microbial challenge.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of phosphates and polyphosphates with different chain length.
AB  - The aim of this study was to monitor the antibacterial effect of seven phosphate  salts on selected strains of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, which could be considered responsible for food-borne diseases (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella enterica ser. Enteritidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). For these purposes, phosphates differing in chain length were used. The tested concentrations were in the range of 0.1-2.0% (wt v(-1)) applied at the model conditions. In the majority of cases the visible inhibitory effect on the growth of observed microorganisms could be seen. Due to the chemical structure of salts and their dissociation both the pH values of cultivation broth and similarly the growth characteristics of bacterial strains were affected. The inhibition of above mentioned bacteria was apparently supported by this dissociation. Phosphates obviously made the development of most Gram-positive bacteria impossible. Especially Micrococcus luteus was extremely sensitive to the presence of these substances. On the other hand, Gram-negative bacteria seemed to be resistant to the phosphate incidence. The exemption clause from the tested salts was represented by a high alkaline trisodium phosphate. It should be pointed out that generally the most significant antibacterial effects were shown by polyphosphates HEXA68 and HEXA70, trisodium phosphate undecahydrate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate and finally trisodium phosphate. By comparing the inhibitory effects of various phosphate salts can be concluded that the antibacterial activity was not determined only by the condensation degree but there was also proved the dependence on pH values.
TI  - Impedimetric biosensor based on cell-mediated bioimprinted films for bacterial detection.
AB  - This work presents the synthesis of bacteria-mediated bioimprinted films for selective bacterial detection. Marine pathogen sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) were chosen as the template bacteria. Chitosan (CS) doped with reduced graphene sheets (RGSs) was electrodeposited on an indium tin oxide electrode, and the resulting RGSs-CS hybrid film served as a platform for bacterial attachment. The electrodeposition conditions were optimized to obtain RGSs-CS hybrid films with excellent electrochemical performance. A layer of nonconductive CS film was deposited to embed the pathogen, and acetone was used to wash away the bacterial templates. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was performed to characterize the stepwise modification process and monitor the SRB population. Faradic impedance measurements revealed that the charge transfer resistance (R(ct)) increased with increased SRB concentration. A linear relationship between DeltaR(ct) and the logarithm of SRB concentration was obtained within the concentration range of 1.0x10(4)cfum L(-1) to 1.0x10(8)cfum L(-1). The impedimetric sensor showed good selectivity towards SRB based on size and shape. Hence, selectivity for bacterial detection can be improved if the bioimprinting technique is combined with other bio-recognition elements.
TI  - The constituents of essential oil: antimicrobial and antioxidant activity of Micromeria congesta Boiss. & Hausskn. ex Boiss. from East Anatolia.
AB  - The chemical composition, antimicrobial activity, total phenol content, total antioxidant activity, and total oxidant status of the essential oil from Micromeria congesta Boiss. & Hausskn. ex Boiss. were investigated. Steam distillation was used to obtain the essential oil, and the chemical analyses were performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The antimicrobial activity was tested by an agar disc diffusion method against the tested microorganisms: Bacillus subtilis NRRL B-744, Bacillus cereus NRRL B-3711, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12598, S. aureus ATCC 25923, S. aureus ATCC 25933, Escherichia coli 0157H7, E. coli ATCC25922, Micrococcus luteus NRLL B-4375, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 19433, Proteus vulgaris RSKK 96026, and Yersinia enterecolitica RSKK 1501. The major compounds found in volatiles of M. congesta were piperitone oxide, linalool oxide, veratrole, pulegone, dihydro carvone, naphthalene, iso-menthone, para-menthone, and cyclohexanone. Compared to that of reference antibiotics, the antibacterial activity of the essential oil is considered as significant. Results showed that M. congesta has the potential for being used in food and medicine depending on its antioxidant and antibacterial activity.
TI  - Precursor-directed syntheses and biological evaluation of new elansolid derivatives.
AB  - The antibiotic elansolid C1 (8) was isolated from Chitinophaga sancti strain FxGBF13 after fermentation in the presence of anthranilic acid. Remarkably, 8 was also obtained by addition of anthranilic acid to a crude fermentation extract containing the macrolide elansolid A2 (1*). This Michael-type conjugate addition allowed us to generate 21 new derivatives of elansolid C1 (9-29) by using various nucleophiles. Biological activities of all derivatives were evaluated against Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, and the mouse cell line L929.
TI  - Infected total knee arthroplasty treatment outcome analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Infected total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a topic of great importance, because its diagnosing and treatment requires a lot of resources, and often has an unsatisfactory outcome. The aim of this study was to analyze the outcome of the treatment of infection developed following TKA. METHODS: This retrospective study of infected TKAs was performed in the period from 1998 to 2008 in the Orthopedics & Traumatology Clinic of the Military Medical Academy (MMA) in Belgrade. A total of 654 primary and revised TKAs were performed in the said period. We registered and surgically treated 28 infected TKAs (primary TKAs: MMA--22, other institutions--6). The incidence of TKA infection in the MMA was 3.36%. The most common pathogens were: Staphylococcus aureus--14 (50%) cases, and Staph. epidermidis--3 (10.7%) cases. Other isolated pathogens were: Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneum., Klebsiella spp., Streptoccocus viridans, Seratia spp, Micrococcus luteus and Peptostreptococcus spp. In one case we had mixed anaerobic flora, and in 3 cases cultures were negative. We analyzed diagnostic challenges, risk factors (such as age and previous viscosupplementation) and treatment outcomes in our series of infected TKAs. RESULTS: In our series 2 infections healed after iv antibiotics and debridement, 1 patient responded to open debridement with component retention, 4 patients responded fully to one-stage reimplantation, 10 cases responded fully to two-stage reimplantation, 11 patients ended with arthrodesis and we had 1 patient withabove knee amputation. CONCLUSION: Two-stage reimplantation remains gold standard for treatment of infected TKA, and we recommend it as treatment of choice for eradication of infection. The antibiotic loaded spacer prothesis concept in most cases allows infection eradication, good function and high patient satisfaction.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of polyethylene glycol, tween 80 and sodium dodecyl sulphate coated silver nanoparticles in normal and multi-drug resistant bacteria.
AB  - Antibacterial activity of silver nanoparticles coated with different functionalizing agents i.e., polyethylene glycol, tween 80 and sodium dodecyl sulphate were evaluated on both normal and multi-drug resistant strains of bacteria. Under the same reaction conditions, these functionalizing agents were added separately to coat silver nanoparticles. Among these, polyethylene glycol coated nanoparticles were most effective in killing all the bacterial strains which includes Escherichia coli DH5a, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus and multi-drug resistant clinical isolates of Shigella spp. (flexneri, boydii, sohnea) and Vibrio cholerae. The minimum inhibitory concentration of polyethylene glycol coated silver nanoparticles was also less compared to the other two sets of nanoparticles. Consistence with that polyethylene glycol coated nanoparticles produced more intracellular reactive oxygen species in bacteria. Moreover, when human cell lines MCF7 and Chang Liver were incubated in presence of these nanoparticles for 18 h with same concentrations as used for bacteria, no toxicity was observed. But significant increase in cell killing was observed with longer incubation time. Thus our present investigation implicates the potential therapeutic use of silver nanoparticles as antibacterial agent particularly the polyethylene glycol coated one.
TI  - Identification of a new Bacillus licheniformis strain producing a bacteriocin-like substance.
AB  - The emergence of antibiotic resistance has spurred a great number of studies for  development of new antimicrobials in the past decade. The purpose of this study was to screen environmental samples for Bacillus strains producing potent antimicrobial agents. A new strain, which showed strong antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella enterica ser. Pullorum, was isolated from soil and designated as B116. This new isolate was identified as Bacillus licheniformis by morphological, biochemical and genetic analyses. The production of bacteriocin-like substance (BLS) started at early exponential phase and achieved highest level at early stationary phase. The BLS was precipitated by ammonium sulfate and its molecular mass was determined as approximately 4 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Culture supernatant of the new isolate exhibited antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella spp. The BLS was resistant to heat, acid and alkaline treatment. Activity of the BLS was totally lost after digestion by pronase and partially lost after digestion by papain and lipase. The new isolate and relevant BLS are potentially useful in food and feed applications.
TI  - Chemical characterization of bioactive compounds from the endophytic fungus Diaporthe helianthi isolated from Luehea divaricata.
AB  - Endophytic microorganisms, defined as fungi or bacteria that colonize the interior of plants without causing any immediate negative effects or damages, have reciprocal relationships with host plants. In some cases their presence is beneficial to the host due to the synthesis of bioactive compounds, among which several alcohols, esters, ketones and others that may react with other compounds and may be lethal to pathogenic microorganisms. Diaporthe helianthi (Phomopsis helianthi in its anamorphic phase) is available worldwide, especially in Europe, Asia and America. Isolated in Europe as an agent of the sunflower stem cancer, it has also been endophytically isolated from tropical and temperate plants. A D. helianthi strain isolated from Luehea divaricata has been employed in current research. An investigation of the secondary metabolite from D. helianthi by CC and NMR of (1)H and (13)C yielded the separation of 10 fractions and the identification of the phenolic compound 2(-4 hydroxyphenyl)-ethanol (Tyrosol). Its antimicrobial reaction was tested and the ensuing antagonistic effects on the human pathogenic bacteria Enterococcus hirae, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus aureus, phytopathogenic Xanthomonas asc. phaseoli and phytopathogenic fungi were demonstrated. Results show that bioactive compounds and Tyrosol produced by D. helianthi have a biotechnological potential.
TI  - Biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles using latex from few Euphorbian plants and their antimicrobial potential.
AB  - The synthesis of well-dispersed and ultrafine metal nanoparticles has great interest due to their distinctive physicochemical properties and biomedical applications. This study is the first report of one-step solvent-free synthesis of AgNPs using Euphorbiaceae plant latex. Among evaluated eight latex-producing plants, four (Jatropha curcas, Jatropha gossypifolia, Pedilanthus tithymaloides, and Euphorbia milii) showed high potential to produce physicochemically distinct, small-sized and bactericidal AgNPs. Phytochemical screening showed presence of rich amount of biochemicals in these plants. J. gossypifolia showed uniformly dispersed comparatively small-sized AgNPs. Dose-dependent growth inhibition of bacterial pathogens Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermis, and Micrococcus luteus was observed for J. gossypifolia latex-synthesized AgNPs with minimum inhibitory concentration values 30, 40, 70, 60, and 60 ppm, respectively, after 24 h. Possible mode of action of AgNPs against pathogens was confirmed by analyzing enzymes and cell leakage.
TI  - Antibacterial anthraquinone derivatives from a sea anemone-derived fungus Nigrospora sp.
AB  - Chemical investigation of a marine-derived fungus Nigrospora sp., isolated from an unidentified sea anemone, yielded two new hydroanthraquinone analogues, 4a-epi-9alpha-methoxydihydrodeoxybostrycin (1) and 10-deoxybostrycin (2), together with seven known anthraquinone derivatives (3-9). The structures of the two new compounds were established through extensive NMR spectroscopy as well as a single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis using Cu Kalpha radiation. The antibacterial activities of compounds 1-9 and 10 acetyl derivatives (6a, 7a, 8a-8g, 9a) were evaluated in vitro. Compound 6a, the acetylated derivative of 6, exhibited promising activity against Bacillus cereus with an MIC value of 48.8 nM, which was stronger than that of the positive control ciprofloxacin (MIC = 1250 nM). Analysis of the antibacterial screening data for the metabolites and their acetyl derivatives revealed the key structural features required for this activity.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Chinese bayberry extract for the preservation of surimi.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chemical preservatives such as sodium nitrite and potassium sorbate have been widely used to keep surimi products fresh. However, the potential harmfulness to human health cannot be ignored. This study was conducted to develop natural preservatives for the storage of Collichthys surimi. RESULTS: Among the eight Chinese traditional herbs and fruits, Chinese bayberry extract showed the greatest inhibitory effect against surimi spoilage bacteria Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Moreover, N-butanol phase extract of bayberry (NB) showed the greatest activity among the different phases of bayberry extract. When Chinese bayberry extract was combined with tea polyphenol, an additive inhibitory effect was observed on growth of Hansenula anomala, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli. Our results further indicated that the shelf life of surimi products stored at room temperature can be extended when supplemented with Chinese bayberry extract. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that Chinese bayberry extract can be used as a natural preservative for the storage of Collichthys surimi.
TI  - Synthesis of novel spirooxindole derivatives by one pot multicomponent reaction and their antimicrobial activity.
AB  - A series of novel spirooxindoles have been synthesized through 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of an azomethine ylide generated from isatin and sarcosine or l-proline with the dipolarophile 1,4-naphthoquinone followed by spontaneous dehydrogenation. Synthesised compounds were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities against eight bacteria and three fungi. All the spirooxindole derivatives exhibited significant antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, S. aureus (MRSA), Enterobacter aerogens, Micrococcus luteus, Proteus vulgaris, Klebsiella pneumonia, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella paratyphi-B and anti-fungal activity against Malassesia pachydermatis, Candida albicans and Botyritis cinerea organisms.

TI  - Production of human lactoferrin in animal milk.
AB  - Genetic constructs containing the human lactoferrin (hLf) gene were created within a joint program of Russian and Belorussian scientists. Using these constructs, transgenic mice were bred (the maximum hLf concentration in their milk was 160 g/L), and transgenic goats were also generated (up to 10 g/L hLf in their milk). Experimental goatherds that produced hLf in their milk were also bred, and the recombinant hLf was found to be identical to the natural protein in its physical and chemical properties. These properties included electrophoretic mobility, isoelectric point, recognition by polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, circular dichroic spectra, interaction with natural ligands (DNA, lipopolysaccharides, and heparin), the binding of iron ions, the sequence of the 7 terminal amino acids, and its biological activity. The latter was assessed by the agglutination of Micrococcus luteus protoplasts, bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes , and fungicidal activity against Candida albicans . We also demonstrated a significant increase in the activity of antibiotics when used in combination with Lf.
TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of Hsp27.6: the first reported small heat  shock protein from Apis cerana cerana.
AB  - Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) play an important role in the cellular defense  of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms against a variety of internal and external stressors. In this study, a cDNA clone encoding a member of the alpha-crystallin/sHSP family, termed AccHsp27.6, was isolated from Apis cerana cerana. The full-length cDNA is 1,014 bp in length and contains a 708-bp open reading frame encoding a protein of 236 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 27.6 kDa and an isoelectric point of 7.53. Seven putative heat shock elements and three NF-kappaB binding sites were present in the 5'-flanking region, suggesting a possible function in immunity. A semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis indicated that AccHsp27.6 was expressed in all tested tissues and at different developmental stages. Furthermore, expression of the AccHsp27.6 transcript was induced by exposure to heat shock, H(2)O(2), a number of different chemicals (including SO(2), formaldehyde, alcohol, acetone, chloroform, and the pesticides phoxime and acetamiprid), and the microbes Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus. In contrast, the mRNA expression could be repressed by CO(2), the pesticides pyriproxyfen and cyhalothrin, and the microbes Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Notably, the recombinant AccHsp27.6 protein exhibited significant in vitro molecular chaperone activity and antimicrobial activity. Taken together, these results suggest that AccHsp27.6 might play an important role in the response to abiotic and biotic stresses and in immune reactions.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro antimicrobial activity of new 4-phenyl-5-methyl-4H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thione derivatives.
AB  - This study presents the synthesis, spectral analysis and antimicrobial evaluation of a new series of substituted 1,2,4-triazole (5a-i) and 1,3,4-thiadiazole derivatives (9a, c, g, h). New compounds were obtained by cyclization reaction of acyl thiosemicarbazide derivatives in the presence of alkaline and acidic media. All synthesized compounds were screened for their in vitro antimicrobial activities. Nine of the compounds had potential activity against Gram-positive bacteria (MIC = 3.91-500 microg/mL). Some compounds showed good activity especially against: Micrococcus luteus ATCC 10240 (MIC = 3.91-31.25 microg/mL), Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 (MIC = 15.63- 62.5 microg/mL), and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 (MIC = 15.63-125 microg/mL).
TI  - In vivo antioxidative property, antimicrobial and wound healing activity of flower extracts of Pyrostegia venusta (Ker Gawl) Miers.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Pyrostegia venusta (Ker Gawl) Miers. (Bignoniaceae), has been traditionally used as a remedy for treating white patches and infections on the skin (leukoderma, vitiligo). AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate wound healing and antimicrobial activity of flower extract of Pyrostegia venusta, including in vivo antioxidant activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Methanolic extracts of Pyrostegia venusta flowers were studied for wound healing efficiency along with its effect on pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines was assessed using excision and incision model of wound repair in Wistar rats. Healing was assessed by the rate of wound contraction, tensile strength, breaking strength, hydroxyproline and hexosamine content. Antimicrobial activity of the flower extract against twelve microorganisms was also assessed. In vivo antioxidant activity was performed to understand the mechanism of wound healing potency. RESULTS: The results indicated that Pyrostegia venusta extract has potent wound healing capacity as evident from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. Hydroxyproline and hexosamine expression were also correlative with the healing pattern observed. Pyrostegia venusta extract exhibited moderate antimicrobial activity against the organisms: Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Candida tropicana. During early wound healing phase TNF-alpha and IL-6 level were found to be up regulated by Pyrostegia venusta treatment. CONCLUSION: Increased wound contraction and tensile strength, augmented hydroxyproline and hexosamine content along with antioxidative activity and moderate antimicrobial activity support the early wound healing exhibited by Pyrostegia venusta flower extract. Induction in cytokine production may be one of the mechanisms involved in accelerating the wound healing by Pyrostegia venusta extract. Results suggest that Pyrostegia venusta may be useful in the tropical management of wound healing.
TI  - In vitro interaction of chronic wound bacteria in biofilms.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To use in vitro biofilm models of wound bacterial isolates and compare the biofilms produced for different combinations of wound bacterial species. METHOD: In vitro biofilms, generated by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus oralis and Micrococcus luteus in microtitre plates and a constant depth film fermentor (CDFF), were studied. The tested isolates all originated from chronic venous leg ulcers. Biofilms of individual and dual combinations of these species were generated in microtitre plate wells at 37 degrees C for 24-96 hours and also in the CDFF for 7 days. The extent of biofilm formation from these systems was then measured using crystal violet staining and/or total viable counts. RESULTS: All the chronic wound bacteria formed biofilms (both individually and in mixed culture) in these models. In mixed species microtitre plate biofilms, both P. aeruginosa and S. aureus appeared to antagonise biofilm formation by S. oralis and M. luteus, with P. aeruginosa completely inhibiting the growth of these organisms. Similar effects were evident in the CDFF model, when all four bacterial species were added simultaneously, with M. luteus being 'out-competed' by the other organisms present and occurring at numbers at the limits of detection; however, there was an apparent increase in the numbers of S. oralis compared with its single culture equivalent. CONCLUSION: The study highlighted differences in biofilm formation ability for the tested species in both closed and open model systems. Using dual species biofilms, distinct species antagonism was observed with apparent antagonism of pathogenic species over 'commensal' ones. Such a finding provides insight into possible bacterial interactions during development of 'non-healing' wound biofilms.
TI  - Antioxidant and antibacterial properties of green, black, and herbal teas of Camellia sinensis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of non-polymeric phenolic (NP) and polymeric tannin (PT) constituents in the antioxidant and antibacterial properties of six brands of green, black, and herbal teas of Camellia sinensis were investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Total phenolic content (TPC) and ascorbic acid equivalent antioxidant capacity (AEAC) were assessed using the Folin-Ciocalteu and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assays, respectively. Minimum inhibitory dose (MID) against Gram-positive Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus, and Gram-negative. Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was assessed using the disc-diffusion method. Teas were extracted with hot water successively three times for one hour each time. The extracts were fractionated using Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography to obtain the NP and PT constituents. RESULTS: Extraction yields ranged from 12 to 23%. Yields of NP fractions (70-81%) were much higher than those of PT fractions (1-11%), suggesting that the former are the major tea components. Ranking of antioxidant properties of extracts was green tea>black tea>herbal tea. For all six teas, antioxidant properties of PT fractions were significantly higher than extracts and NP fractions. Extracts and fractions of all six teas showed no activity against the three Gram-negative bacteria. Green teas inhibited all three Gram-positive bacteria with S. aureus being the least susceptible. Black and herbal teas inhibited the growth of M. luteus and B. cereus, but not S. aureus. The most potent were the PT fractions of Boh Cameron Highlands and Ho Yan Hor with MID of 0.01 and 0.03 mg/disc against M. luteus. CONCLUSION: Results suggested that NP constituents are major contributors to the antioxidant and antibacterial properties of teas of C. sinensis. Although PT constituents have stronger antioxidant and antibacterial properties, they constitute only a minor component of the teas.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activities of novel 2,5-diphenylindolo[2,3-e] pyrazolo[1',5':3",4"]pyrimido[2",1"-c] [1,2,4]triazines.
AB  - The formation of (E)-3-{2-(2,5-diphenylpyrazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidin-7-yl)hydrazono}indolin-2-ones 3 has been achieved by condensation of equimolar amounts of 7-hydrazino-2,5-diphenylpyrazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidine (1) and isatin (or isatin derivatives) 2 at room temperature. The (E)-products could be isomerized into corresponding the (Z)-3 isomers. Reactions of the latter fused heterocyclic hydrazones towards different electro-philic reagents yielded the corresponding 3-substituted derivatives 4-7. Dehydrative cyclisation of the hydrazones 3 using phosphorus oxychloride afforded the 2,5-diphenyl- indolo[2,3-e]pyrazolo[1',5':3",4"]pyrimido[2",1"-c][1,2,4] triazines 13. The polyfused heterocyclic ring system 13 underwent electrophilic substitution reactions at position 4 rather than at position 3. The 3-bromo isomer of 17 was prepared by a sequence of reactions starting from 2,5-diphenylpyrazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidine-7(6H)-thione (11). The orientation of the electrophilic attack was supported by spectroscopic and chemical evidence. Some of the synthesized compounds were found to possess slight to moderate activity against the microorganisms Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Peptidoglycan recognition protein 3 (PglyRP3) has an anti-inflammatory role in intestinal epithelial cells.
AB  - Intestinal epithelial cells produce cytokines in response to bacterial peptidoglycan (PGN), which is detected by several classes of pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) as peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGlyRPs), Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and NOD receptors. All types of PGlyRPs recognize bacterial peptidoglycan and function in antibacterial innate immunity. In this study, we investigated the role of PGlyRP3 in the response of intestinal epithelial cells (Caco-2) to PGN from pathogenic (Staphylococcus aureus), opportunistic pathogenic (Micrococcus luteus) and non-pathogenic (Bacillus subtilis and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG) bacteria found in the gut as commensals or in gastroenteritis. All PGNs induced the proinflammatory cytokines IL-12p35, IL-8 and TNF-alpha and, time-dependently, PGlyRP3, at both the transcription and protein levels. In this context, no differences were observed among the distinct PGN obtained from different bacterial sources. The inflammatory response to PGN is mediated via the TLR2 pathway, since blocking this pathway by inhibiting MyD88 reduced the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. In addition, PGlyRP3 overexpression suppressed, while PGlyRP3 knocking down enhanced the expression of PGN-induced inflammatory cytokines. It is concluded that PGN stimulates inflammatory responses in the intestinal epithelia through activation of the TLR pathway. PGlyRP3 is also stimulated by PGN and has, in contrast to activation of the TLR pathway, an anti-inflammatory effect.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity, cytotoxicity, and phytochemical screening of Voacanga globosa (Blanco) Merr. leaf extract (Apocynaceae).
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the antibacterial, antifungal, antiprotozoal, cytotoxic,  and phytochemical properties of ethanol extracts of leaves of Voacanga globosa (Blanco) Merr. (V. globosa). METHODS: The extracts were tested against bacteria and fungus through disc diffusion assay; against protozoa through growth curve determination, antiprotozoal and cytotoxicity assays. RESULTS: The extract revealed antibacterial activities, inhibiting the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Micrococcus luteus, and Salmonella typhimurium. Antifungal assay showed that it inhibited Candida albicans. The antiprotozoal assay against Trichomonas vaginalis and Entamoeba histolytica showed that V. globosa can inhibit the parasites, wherein the action can be comparable to metronidazole. With the in situ cell death detection kit, Trichomonas vaginalis and Entamoeba histolytica exposed to V. globosa leaf extract was observed to fluoresce simultaneously in red and yellow signals signifying apoptotic-like changes. Preliminary phytochemical screening revealed the chemical composition of plant extract containing alkaloids, saponins, 2-deoxysugars, and hydrolysable tannins. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, this study provides scientific evidence on the traditional use of V. globosa leaf extract in treating microbial diseases. Further, the leaf extract can possibly be used to produce alternative forms of antimicrobials.
TI  - A new sesquiterpene from endophytic fungus Aspergillus sp.
AB  - A fungal strain named YLF-14 was isolated from the leaf of Altingia yunnunensis.  Based on the sequence at the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, the strain was identified as an Aspergillus sp.. A new sesquiterpene 5beta,8abeta-dimethyl-3,4,4abeta,5,6,7,8,8a-octahydronaphthalene-1,2,5alpha-trime thanol (1) and a known compound 12-N-methylcyclo-(L-tryptophyl-L-phenylalanyl) (2) were isolated from the culture of this strain. Bioassay experiments showed that the two compounds had no obvious effect on the growth of tested bacteria and nematodes.
TI  - [Synthesis and antimicrobial evaluation of coumarin-based benzotriazoles and their synergistic effects with chloromycin and fluconazole].
AB  - A series of new coumarin-based benzotriazole derivatives were successfully synthesized via a multi-step sequence of cyclization, etherification and N-alkylation, and were confirmed by 1H NMR, IR, MS spectra as well as elemental analyses. All these synthesized coumarin compounds were evaluated for in vitro antimicrobial activities against four Gram-positive bacteria, four Gram-negative bacteria and three fungi by two fold serial dilution technique. The bioactive assay showed that all these prepared coumarin benzotriazoles could inhibit the growth of the tested bacterial and fungal strains. Title compounds 11a-11e and 13a-13c were more active than chloromycin on Proteus vulgaris ATCC 6896. Coumarin benzotriazoles 11a and 11b displayed comparable antibacterial efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and Micrococcus luteus ATCC 4698 in comparison with reference drug chloromycin. Compared to fluconazole, compounds 11a-11d displayed stronger inhibition on Aspergillus fumigatus ATCC 96918. Moreover, coumarin-based benzotriazoles in combination with antibacterial chloromycin or antifungal fluconazole, showed notable antimicrobial efficacy with less dosage and broader antimicrobial spectrum. More importantly, fluconazole-insensitive A. fumigatus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus N 315 (MRSA) were sensitive to these combined drugs.
TI  - Synthesis, antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity of some new carbazole derivatives.
AB  - In this work, some N-(9-Ethyl-9H-carbazole-3-yl)-2-(phenoxy)acetamide derivatives were synthesised and evaluated for their antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity. The structural elucidation of the compounds was performed by IR, (1)H-NMR, (13)C-NMR and FAB(+)-MS spectral data and elemental analyses. The title compounds were obtained by reacting 2-chloro-N-(9-ethyl-9H-carbazole-3-yl)acetamide with some substituted phenols. The synthesised compounds were investigated for their antibacterial and antifungal activities against Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes and Candida albicans. The compounds N-(9-Ethyl-9H-carbazole-3-yl)-2-(4-ethylphenoxy)acetamide (2c) and N-(9-Ethyl-9H-carbazole-3-yl)-2-(quinolin-8-yloxy)acetamide (2n) showed notable antimicrobial activity. The compounds were also studied for their cytotoxic effects using MTT assay, and it was seen that 2n had the lowest cytotoxic activity against NIH/3T3 cells.
TI  - Characterization of Micrococcus strains isolated from indoor air.
AB  - The characterization of microbes, such as opportunists and pathogens (e.g., methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA]), in indoor air is important for understanding disease transmission from person-to-person. Common genera found in the human skin microbiome include Micrococcus and Staphylococcus, but there only a limited number of tests to differentiate these genera and/or species. Both genera are believed to be released into indoor air from the shedding of human skin and are morphologically difficult to distinguish. In the current work, after the extraction of proteins from micrococci and the separation of these proteins on one dimensional electrophoretic gels, tryptic peptides were analyzed by MALDI TOF MS and the mass profiles compared with those of a reference strain (ATCC 4698). The results confirmed that all strains were consistent in identity with Micrococcus luteus.
TI  - In vitro screening of Circium arvense for potential antibacterial and antifungal  activities.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of Circium arvense extracts were evaluated against two human gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus) and four gram negative pathogen (Escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter, Klebsiella pneumoniae). The Methanol extracts of Circium arvense were used to obtain various fractions (X1) n-hexane, (X2) chloroform, (X3) ethyl acetate and (X4) n-butanol. The agar well diffusion assay and agar dilution susceptibility testing were carried out to determine the zone of inhibitions and the minimum inhibitory concentration respectively. Antifungal activity was employed by agar well diffusion method. The Ampicilline, Ofloxacine and Itraconazole were used as standard agents. Almost all fractions exhibited more or less antimicrobial activity. The X2 (Chloroform) fraction was reported as highly active fraction with good antimicrobial activity MIC 0.312 mg/ml against staphylococcus areous. The MBC values of fraction X2 (chloroform) was 2 times the MIC. Similarly all fractions exhibited good inhibitory activities against Aspergillus niger. The fraction X1(n-hexane) was found highly active 6(+/-0.11), followed by X2 (chloroform) fraction 5 (+/-0.17). Present study provides a base to explore the antimicrobial potential of Circium arvense. It is concluded that the Circium arvense having potential antibacterial and antifungal activities, irrespective of fact that the MIC values reported were high. Further investigations are recommended to exploit the hidden medicinal value of plant.
TI  - Phytochemical screening and antimicrobial activity of roots of Murraya koenigii (Linn.) Spreng. (Rutaceae).
AB  - Murraya koenigii, family Rutaceae, commonly known as Curry leaf plant is a highly valued plant for its medicinal value and characteristic aroma. The plant is a rich source of carbazole alkaloids. The petroleum ether, chloroform, ethyl acetate and ethanol extracts of roots of the plant were screened for phytochemical properties and antimicrobial activity for Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger. Phytochemical screening showed the presence of carbohydrates, alkaloids, steroids and flavonoids in the root extracts of the plant. The study shows that all the extracts possess remarkable antibacterial activity. Additionally, petroleum ether and chloroform extracts also had antifungal activity.
TI  - Antagonistic intestinal microflora produces antimicrobial substance inhibitory to Pseudomonas species and other spoilage organisms.
AB  - Chicken intestine harbors a vast number of bacterial strains. In the present study, antimicrobial substance produced by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of healthy chicken was detected, characterized, and purified. Based on 16S rRNA sequencing, the bacteria were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum vN. The antimicrobial substance produced by this bacterium was designated vN-1 and exhibited a broad-spectrum of activity against many important pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Erwinia amylovova. vN-1 was determined to be thermostable, insensitive to pH values ranging from 2.0 to 8.0, resistant to various organic solvents and to enzymatic inactivation. The inhibition kinetics displayed a bactericidal mode of action. This study revealed an antimicrobial substance with low molecular mass of less than 1 kDa as determined by ultrafiltration and having features not previously reported for LAB isolated from chicken intestines. The detection of this antimicrobial substance addresses an important aspect of biotechnological control agents of spoilage caused by Pseudomonas spp. and promises the possibility for preservation of refrigerated poultry meat. Practical Application: The newly characterized antimicrobial substance and designated as vN-1 may have the potential to be used in food preservation.
TI  - A newly isolated Streptomyces sp. CS392 producing three antimicrobial compounds.
AB  - With the aim of isolating new microbes capable of producing strong antimicrobial  substances, strain CS392 was screened from 700 soil isolates preserved in our laboratory. The strain was related to genus Streptomyces based on various characteristics. Three highly active antimicrobial compounds, C1, C2 and C3, produced by the strain were purified by solvent extraction followed by silica gel column chromatography. These compounds were highly active against various Gram-positive resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA), and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). Among three, C3 was the most active against MRSA and VRSA with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 2 mug/ml while C2 and C3 had MIC values of 4 mug/ml for the strains. In case of Bacillus subtilis ATCC6633, C1 and C3 were more effective with MIC values of 0.5 mug/ml than C2 with MIC of 2 mug/ml. Those antibiotics were variably active (MIC of 4-32 mug/ml) against Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Mycobacterium smegmatis ATCC 9341 and VRE.
TI  - A new biphenyl and antimicrobial activity of extracts and compounds from Clusia burlemarxii.

Extracts and compounds showed significant activity against tested Gram-positive bacteria, none activity against tested Gram-negative bacteria and fungi.
TI  - In-vitro antimicrobial activity and synergistic/antagonistic effect of interactions between antibiotics and some spice essential oils.
AB  - Spices and herbs have been used for many years by different cultures. The aim of  the present study is (1) to investigate in-vitro antimicrobial effects of different spices and herbs (5 species: Rosmarinus officinalis (Rosemary), Coriandrum sativum (coriander), Micromeria fruticosa (L.) Druce subsp. Brachycalyx P.H. Davis (White micromeria), Cumium cyminum (cumin), Mentha piperita (Peppermint) against different bacteria and fungi species, and (2) to discuss the in-vitro possible effects between the plants and antibiotics. The microorganisms used were Micrococcus luteus LA 2971, Bacillus megaterium NRS, Bacillus brevis FMC 3, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 15753, Pseudomonas pyocyaneus DC 127, Mycobacterium smegmatis CCM 2067, Escherichia coil DM, Aeromonas hydrophila ATCC 7966, Yersinia enterocolitica AU 19, Staphylococcus aureus Cowan 1, Streptococcus faecalis DC 74 bacteria, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae WET 136, Kluvyeromyces fragilis DC 98 fungi in this study. The results indicated that essential oils of Rosmarinus officinalis, Coriandrum sativum L., Micromeria fruticosa (L.) Druce subsp. brachycalyx P.H. Davis, Cumium cyminum L., Mentha piperita L. were shown antimicrobial activity in the range of 7-60 mm 2 microl(-1) inhibition zone to the microorganisms tested, using disc diffusion method. Standard antibiotic such as Gentamicin (10 microg), Cephalothin (30 microg), Ceftriaxone (10 microg), Nystatin (10 U) discs were used for comparison with the antimicrobial activities of essential oils of these plants. In addition, antibacterial activity of essential oils of these plants was researched by effects when it was used together with these standard antibiotics in vitro. However, antibacterial activity changed also by in vitro interactions between these standard antibiotics and essential oils of these plants. Synergic, additive or antagonist effects were observed in antibacterial activity.
TI  - Ctriporin, a new anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus peptide from the venom of the scorpion Chaerilus tricostatus.
AB  - Antibiotic-resistant microbes, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, seriously threaten human health. The outbreak of "superbugs" in recent years emphasizes once again the need for the development of new antimicrobial agents or resources. Antimicrobial peptides have an evident bactericidal effect against multidrug-resistant pathogens. In the present study, a new antimicrobial peptide, ctriporin, was cloned and characterized from the venom of the scorpion Chaerilus tricostatus, an animal which has not yet been explored for toxic peptide resources. The MICs of ctriporin against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus thuringiensis, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, and Candida albicans are 5 to 20 mug/ml. Meanwhile, it MIC against clinical antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains is 10 mug/ml. Furthermore, the potential for ctriporin to be used as a topical antibiotic for treating staphylococcal skin infections was investigated. External use of the peptide ctriporin dramatically decreased the bacterial counts and cured skin infections in mice. In addition, ctriporin demonstrates antimicrobial efficacy via the bactericidal mechanism of rapid cell lysis. Together, these results suggest the potential of developing ctriporin as a new topical antibiotic.
TI  - N-O chemistry for antibiotics: discovery of N-alkyl-N-(pyridin-2-yl)hydroxylamine scaffolds as selective antibacterial agents using nitroso Diels-Alder and ene chemistry.
AB  - The discovery, syntheses, and structure-activity relationships (SAR) of a new family of heterocyclic antibacterial compounds based on N-alkyl-N-(pyridin-2-yl)hydroxylamine scaffolds are described. A structurally diverse library of approximately 100 heterocyclic molecules generated from Lewis acid-mediated nucleophilic ring-opening reactions with nitroso Diels-Alder cycloadducts and nitroso ene reactions with substituted alkenes was evaluated in whole cell antibacterial assays. Compounds containing the N-alkyl-N-(pyridin-2-yl)hydroxylamine structure demonstrated selective and potent antibacterial activity against the Gram-positive bacterium Micrococcus luteus ATCC 10240 (MIC(90) = 2.0 muM or 0.41 mug/mL) and moderate activity against other Gram-positive strains including antibiotic resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Enterococcus faecalis (VRE). A new synthetic route to the active core was developed using palladium-catalyzed Buchwald-Hartwig amination reactions of N-alkyl-O-(4-methoxybenzyl)hydroxylamines with 2-halo-pyridines that facilitated SAR studies and revealed the simplest active structural fragment. This work shows the value of using a combination of diversity-oriented synthesis (DOS) and parallel synthesis for identifying new antibacterial scaffolds.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of the skin mucus of the freshwater fishes, Rita rita and Channa punctatus.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The skin mucus of Rita rita and Channa punctatus was investigated to  explore the possibilities of its antibacterial properties. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Skin mucus was extracted in acidic solvents (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 3% acetic acid) and in triple distilled water (aqueous medium). The antibacterial activity of the mucus extracts was analyzed, using disc diffusion method, against five strains of bacteria--the Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus; and the Gram negative Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhi. RESULTS: In both Rita rita and Channa punctatus, the skin mucus extracted in acidic solvents as well as in aqueous medium show antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus. Nevertheless, the activity is higher in acidic solvents than that in aqueous medium. The acidic mucus extracts of Rita rita, show antibacterial activity against Salmonella typhi as well. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that fish skin mucus have bactericidal properties and thus play important role in the protection of fish against the invasion of pathogens. Fish skin mucus could thus be regarded as a potential source of novel antibacterial components.
TI  - Antioxidant, electrochemical, thermal, antimicrobial and alkane oxidation properties of tridentate Schiff base ligands and their metal complexes.
AB  - In this study, two Schiff base ligands (HL(1) and HL(2)) and their Cu(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Pd(II) and Ru(III) metal complexes were synthesized and characterized by the analytical and spectroscopic methods. Alkane oxidation activities of the metal complexes were studied on cyclohexane as substrate. The ligands and their metal complexes were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against Corynebacterium xerosis, Bacillus brevis, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus cereus, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus and Enterococcus faecalis (as gram-positive bacteria) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Klebsiella fragilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Candida albicans (as gram-negative bacteria). The antioxidant properties of the Schiff base ligands were evaluated in a series of in vitro tests: 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging and reducing power activity of superoxide anion radical generated non-enzymatic systems. Electrochemical and thermal properties of the compounds were investigated.
TI  - Bacterial infection of mudfish Clarias gariepinus (Siluriformes: Clariidae) fingerlings in tropical nursery ponds.
AB  - Bacterial infection among the most common cultured mudfish Clarias gariepinus in  Africa, has become a cause of concern, because it constitutes the largest economic loss in fish farms. In order to provide useful biological data of the pathogens for good management practices, samples were collected monthly between January 2008 and December 2009 in three monoculture nursery ponds, located in three different positions: upriver (A, grassland), mid-river (B, mixed forest and grassland) and downriver (C, rainforest) along 200 km length of Cross River floodplains, Nigeria. A total of 720 fingerlings between 15.1 and 20.7 g were analyzed to determine the degree of infection. The bacterial pathogens were taken from their external surfaces, and were isolated and identified by standard methods. The caudal fins of fingerlings from pond A had the highest bacterial load (5.8 x 10(3) cfu/g), while the least counts (1.2 x 103 cfu/g) were identified on the head of fish from pond C, with Flexibacter columnaris as the major etiological agent. Pseudomonas fluorescens, Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus were identified as co-isolates with P. fluorescens as dominant (0.7 x 10(2) cfu/mL) co-isolates in pond water. Clinical signs of five white spots with red periphery appeared on the external surface of infected fish. All the fish sampled, died after 4 to 9 days. There was no significant difference in the bacterial counts between different ponds, but the difference between fish organs/parts examined was significant. Fish from these ponds are therefore potentially dangerous to consumers and highly devalued, with the economic impact to producers. Preventive methods to avoid these infections are recommended.
TI  - Anti-proliferative activity of meroditerpenoids isolated from the brown alga Stypopodium flabelliforme against several cancer cell lines.
AB  - The sea constitutes one of the most promising sources of novel compounds with potential application in human therapeutics. In particular, algae have proved to be an interesting source of new bioactive compounds. In this work, six meroditerpenoids (epitaondiol, epitaondiol diacetate, epitaondiol monoacetate, stypotriol triacetate, 14-ketostypodiol diacetate and stypodiol) isolated from the brown alga Stypopodium flabelliforme were tested for their cell proliferation inhibitory activity in five cell lines. Cell lines tested included human colon adenocarcinoma (Caco-2), human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y), rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3), murine macrophages (RAW.267) and Chinese hamster fibroblasts (V79). Antimicrobial activity of the compounds was also evaluated against Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis and Micrococcus luteus. Overall, the compounds showed good activity against all cell lines, with SH-SY5Y and RAW.267 being the most susceptible. Antimicrobial capacity was observed for epitaondiol monoacetate, stypotriol triacetate and stypodiol, with the first being the most active. The results suggest that these molecules deserve further studies in order to evaluate their potential as therapeutic agents.
TI  - Phytochemical analysis and antimicrobial activities of methanolic extracts of leaf, stem and root from different varieties of Labisa pumila Benth.
AB  - A local herb, Kacip Fatimah, is famous amongst Malay women for its uses in parturition; however, its phytochemical contents have not been fully documented. Therefore, a study was performed to evaluate the phenolics, flavonoids, and total saponin contents, and antibacterial and antifungal properties of the leaf, stem and root of three varieties of Labisia pumila Benth. Total saponins were found to be higher in the leaves of all three varieties, compared to the roots and stems. Leaves of var. pumila exhibited significantly higher total saponin content than var. alata and lanceolata, with values of 56.4, 43.6 and 42.3 mg diosgenin equivalent/g dry weight, respectively. HPLC analyses of phenolics and flavonoids in all three varieties revealed the presence of gallic acid, caffeic acid, rutin, and myricetin in all plant parts. Higher levels of flavonoids (rutin, quercitin, kaempferol) were observed in var. pumila compared with alata and lanceolata, whereas higher accumulation of phenolics (gallic acid, pyrogallol) was recorded in var. alata, followed by pumila and lanceolata. Antibacterial activities of leaf, stem and root extracts of all varieties determined against both Gram positive (Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis B145, Bacillus cereus B43, Staphylococcus aureus S1431) and Gram negative (Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumonia K36, Escherichia coli E256, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PI96) pathogens showed that crude methanolic extracts are active against these bacteria at low concentrations, albeit with lower antibacterial activity compared to kanamycin used as the control. Antifungal activity of methanolic extracts of all plant parts against Fusarium sp., Candida sp. and Mucor using the agar diffusion disc exhibited moderate to appreciable antifungal activities compared to streptomycin used as positive control.
TI  - Natural resistance of rose petals to microbial attack.
AB  - Petals of red, yellow and white roses (Rosa damascene Mill.) of the family Rosaceae were extracted with (1:1) methylene chloride/methanol and tested for their antimicrobial activities against four species of Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus aureus), five species of Gram-negative bacteria (Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens) and five species of fungi (Penicillium notatum, Aspergillus niger, Rhizopus stolonifer, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Fusarium oxysporum). All of the crude extracts showed a wide range of antimicrobial activities according to the tested organism and rose's type. Micrococcus luteus was found to be the most susceptible bacteria to all crude extracts. Red and yellow petal extracts showed much higher antibacterial activity than the white petals extract. Bacillus subtilis was found to be the least susceptible to all extracts. The fungus, Penicillium notatum was found to be the most susceptible with white petal extract being the most effective. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Fusarium oxysporum were the least susceptible to all extracts. White roses extract showed much higher antifungal activities against Penicillium notatum than red or yellow roses, therefore, it was subjected to several bioassay guided chromatographic fractionations and purification to isolate the active chemical(s) responsible for the antifungal activity. Chemical structure of the isolated antifungal compounds were identified by spectroscopy techniques and found to be a gamma-sitosterol and (Z,Z)-9,12-octadecadienoic acid. Antibacterial activity of the various types of rose extracts were due to complex mixtures of organic compounds which are still under chemical investigation and will be published later.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activities of hexahydroimidazo[1,5-a]pyridinium bromides with varying benzyl substituents.
AB  - Variously substituted benzyl bromides were employed to quaternize hexahydrobenzylimidazo[1,5-a]pyridine (A) and the resulting bromides (1-11) were evaluated for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against 10 pathogenic microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus cereus, Micrococcus luteus, Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumonia, Candida albicans and Candida krusei. Antimicrobial activities were surprisingly high (MIC: 0.78-400 mug/mL) and the sensitivity of the salts tested has been found to depend strongly both on the benzyl substituents and the microorganisms used. However, the correlation observed between antimicrobial activity and calculated partition coefficient (ClogP) was poor. Acute toxicity assessment of these salts showed LD(50) of 757-2000 mg/kg, after oral administration in mice in 24h.
TI  - Synthesis, antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity of novel oxadiazole derivatives.
AB  - In the present study, 5-substituted-1,3,4-oxadiazolin-2-thiones (1a-b) were synthesized via the ring closure reactions of appropriate acid hydrazides with carbon disulphide. N-(Benzothiazol-2-yl)-2-[[5-substituted-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl]sulfanyl]acetamide derivatives (3a-j) were obtained by the nucleophilic substitution reactions of 5-substituted-1,3,4-oxadiazolin-2-thiones (1a-b) with N-(benzothiazol-2-yl)-2-chloroacetamides. The chemical structures of the compounds were elucidated by IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and FAB(+)-MS spectral data and elemental analyses. The synthesized compounds were screened for their antimicrobial activities against Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes and Candida albicans. All compounds except compound 3h exhibited the highest antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa. Among all compounds (3a-j), the compounds bearing 4-methoxyphenoxymethyl moiety on oxadiazole ring (3a-e) exhibited the highest inhibitory activity against C. albicans. Although compound 3j did not possess 4-methoxyphenoxymethyl moiety on oxadiazole ring, this derivative also exhibited the same level of anti-candidal activity. The compounds were also investigated for their cytotoxic effects using MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. Compound 3a exhibited the highest cytotoxic activity, whereas compound 3g possessed the lowest cytotoxic activity against NIH/3T3 cells.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Greek endemic Stachys spruneri and its main component, isoabienol.
AB  - The essential oils of Stachys spruneri Boiss. (sample A and sample B) were analyzed by GC and GC-MS. (+)-Isoabienol was the dominant component (49.5 and 48.2%, respectively of the total oils) among seventy-two identified constituents. Isoabienol was separated, purified by preparative thin-layer chromatography, and further identified by means ofphysicochemical and spectrometric analysis. The microbial growth inhibitory properties of the essential oil and its main metabolite, the labdane diterpene isoabienol, were determined using the broth microdilution method against eight laboratory strains of bacteria (Gram-positive: Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, and Gram- negative: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and two strains of the yeast Candida albicans. Both essential oil and isoabienol showed considerable activity against all the microorganisms tested, with the isolated compound being most active.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro microbiological evaluation of novel diethyl 6,6'-(1,4-phenylene)bis(4-aryl-2-oxo-cyclohex-3-enecarboxylates).
AB  - Novel bis cyclohexenone ester derivatives 14-19 were synthesized and characterized by their spectral data. In vitro microbiological evaluations were carried out for all the novel compounds 14-19 against clinically isolated bacterial and fungal strains. Compounds 15, 16, 18 against Staphylococcus aureus, 14, 15 against beta-Haemolytic streptococcus, 15, 19 against Micrococcus luteus, 17, 18 against Salmonella typhii, 14, 17 against Shigella flexneri, 15 against Escherichia coli, 16 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 15, 18, 19 against Klebsiella pneumonia exhibited potent antibacterial activity at an minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 6.25 mug/ml, whereas compound 16 against Aspergillus flavus, 17 against A. niger, 16, 18 against Mucor indicus, 15, 17-19 against Microsporum gypseum revealed excellent antifungal activity at an MIC value of 6.25 mug/ml.
TI  - Antioxidant and antibacterial characteristics of phenolic extracts of locally produced honey in Saudi Arabia.
AB  - The antibacterial and antioxidant properties of 30 selected honey samples produced in Saudi Arabia have been studied. The inhibitory action of the total phenolic content of the honey samples has been tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus and Escherichia coli. The MIC values of the ten selected honey samples against S. aureus, M. luteus and E. coli were in the range 0.5 +/- 0.2 - 3.6 +/- 0.3; 0.45 +/- 0.05 - 5.0 +/- 0.6 and 0.6 +/- 0.2 - 4.4 +/- 0.4 mg mL(- 1). The antioxidant activities of the ethyl acetate extracts based on their anti-radical power using the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl scavenging assay and their ferric reducing antioxidant power were in the ranges 50.78 +/- 1.4% to 99.52 +/- 0.2% and 0.85 +/- 0.13 to 1.167 +/- 0.13 mg/ml, respectively. The total phenolic content was in the range 84.97 +/- 0.57 to 317.39 +/- 0.76 mg/100 g.
TI  - Relative roles of the cellular and humoral responses in the Drosophila host defense against three gram-positive bacterial infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Two NF-kappaB signaling pathways, Toll and immune deficiency (imd), are required for survival to bacterial infections in Drosophila. In response to septic injury, these pathways mediate rapid transcriptional activation of distinct sets of effector molecules, including antimicrobial peptides, which are important components of a humoral defense response. However, it is less clear to what extent macrophage-like hemocytes contribute to host defense. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In order to dissect the relative importance of humoral and cellular defenses after septic injury with three different gram-positive bacteria (Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus), we used latex bead pre-injection to ablate macrophage function in flies wildtype or mutant for various Toll and imd pathway components. We found that in all three infection models a compromised phagocytic system impaired fly survival--independently of concomitant Toll or imd pathway activation. Our data failed to confirm a role of the PGRP-SA and GNBP1 Pattern Recognition Receptors for phagocytosis of S. aureus. The Drosophila scavenger receptor Eater mediates the phagocytosis by hemocytes or S2 cells of E. faecalis and S. aureus, but not of M. luteus. In the case of M. luteus and E. faecalis, but not S. aureus, decreased survival due to defective phagocytosis could be compensated for by genetically enhancing the humoral immune response. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results underscore the fundamental importance of both cellular and humoral mechanisms in Drosophila immunity and shed light on the balance between these two arms of host defense depending on the invading pathogen.
TI  - Maklamicin, an antibacterial polyketide from an endophytic Micromonospora sp.
AB  - A new spirotetronate-class polyketide, maklamicin (1), was isolated from the culture extract of an endophytic actinomycete of the genus Micromonospora. The structure and relative configuration of 1 were elucidated by interpretation of NMR and other spectroscopic data, and the absolute configuration was determined using the modified Mosher method. Maklamicin (1) showed strong to modest antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Antibacterial efficacy of raw and processed honey.
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activity of methanol, ethanol, and ethyl acetate extracts  of raw and processed honey was tested against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Micrococcus luteus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhi). Both types of honey showed antibacterial activity against tested organisms with the zone of inhibition (ZOI) ranging from 6.94 to 37.94 mm, while E. coli, S. typhi, and P. aeruginosa showed that sensibility towards all the extracts with ZOI ranges between 13.09 to 37.94 mm. The methanol extract showed more potent activity than other organic extracts. Gram-negative bacteria were found to be more susceptible as compared to Gram-positive bacteria except E. faecalis. The broth microdilution assay gave minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) value of 625 mug/mL, while the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) ranges between 625 mug/mL 2500 mug/mL. The study showed that honey has antibacterial activity (bacteriostatic and bactericidal effect), similar to antibiotics, against test organisms and provides alternative therapy against certain bacteria.
TI  - Recognition of microbial molecular patterns and stimulation of prophenoloxidase activation by a beta-1,3-glucanase-related protein in Manduca sexta larval plasma.
AB  - Detection of pathogenic invaders is the essential first step of a successful defense response in multicellular organisms. In this study, we have identified a new member of the beta-1,3-glucanase-related protein superfamily from the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta. This protein, designated microbe binding protein (MBP), is 61% identical in sequence to Bombyx mori Gram-negative bacteria binding protein, but only 34-36% identical to M. sexta beta-1,3-glucan recognition protein-1 and 2. Its mRNA levels were strongly up-regulated in hemocytes and fat body of immune challenged larvae, along with an increase in concentration of the plasma protein. We expressed M. sexta MBP in a baculovirus-insect cell system. The purified protein associated with intact bacteria and fungi. It specifically bound to lipoteichoic acid, lipopolysaccharide, diaminopimelic acid-type peptidoglycans (DAP-PGs) from Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, but less so to laminarin or Lys-type PG from Staphylococcus aureus. The complex binding pattern was influenced by other plasma factors and additional microbial surface molecules. After different amounts of MBP had been incubated with larval plasma on ice, a concentration-dependent increase in phenoloxidase (PO) activity occurred in the absence of any microbial elicitor. The activity increase was also observed in the mixture of plasma and a bacterial or fungal cell wall component. The prophenoloxidase (proPO) activation became more prominent when DAP-PGs, Micrococcus luteus Lys-PG, or lipoteichoic acid was included in the mixture of MBP and plasma. Statistic analysis suggested that a synergistic enhancement of proPO activation was caused by an interaction between MBP and these elicitors, but not S. aureus Lys-PG, lipopolysaccharide, curdlan, or laminarin. These data indicate that M. sexta MBP is a component of the surveillance mechanism and, by working together with other pattern recognition molecules and serine proteinases, triggers the proPO activation system.
TI  - Minimal antimicrobial peptidic sequence from hemoglobin alpha-chain: KYR.
AB  - Hemoglobin is an animal protein described as a source of biologically active peptides. Peptic digestion of bovine hemoglobin alpha-chain allowed obtaining peptide fractions with antimicrobial activity. These peptides were purified by reverse-phase High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and characterized by mass spectrometry. The minimal inhibitory concentration and mode of action of these peptides were studied against five bacterial strains including Escherichia coli and Salmonella enteritidis as Gram-negative bacteria and Listeria innocua, Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus aureus as Gram-positive bacteria. The action aforementioned peptides were studied on artificial membranes as well. The most active peptides resulted to be the short ones. Consequently, the minimal peptidic sequence necessary for the antibacterial activity was clearly determined: KYR.
TI  - Synthesis and evaluation of a class of new coumarin triazole derivatives as potential antimicrobial agents.
AB  - A series of new coumarin-based 1,2,4-triazole derivatives were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their antimicrobial activities in vitro against four Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, Bacillus subtilis and Micrococcus luteus), four Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella typhi and Shigella dysenteriae) as well as three fungi (Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus fumigatus) by two-fold serial dilution technique. The bioactive assay showed that some synthesized coumarin triazoles displayed comparable or even better antibacterial and antifungal efficacy in comparison with reference drugs Enoxacin, Chloromycin and Fluconazole. Coumarin bis-triazole compounds exhibited stronger antibacterial and antifungal efficiency than their corresponding mono-triazole derivatives.
TI  - Gram-negative and gram-positive antibacterial properties of the whole plant extract of willow herb (Epilobium angustifolium).
AB  - The emergence of new pathogens and the increase in the number of multidrug-resistant strains in well-established pathogens during the past decade represent a growing public health concern globally. With the current lack of research and development of new antibiotics by large pharmaceutical companies due to poor financial returns, new alternatives need to be explored including natural herbal or plant-based extracts with reported antibacterial properties. Willow herb (Epilobium angustifolium) preparations have been used in traditional aboriginal and folk medicine preparations externally as an antiphlogistic to treat prostate and gastrointestinal disorders and as an antiseptic to treat infected wounds. The authors hypothesized that a whole plant extract of willow herb would exhibit antimicrobial properties on a variety of both Gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in culture. The authors found that, in comparison to growth controls, willow herb extract significantly inhibited the growth of Micrococcus luteus (p < .01), Staphylococcus aureus (p < .05), Escherichia coli (p < .001), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (p < .001). They also found that willow herb extract inhibited the growth of bacteria in culture more effectively than vancomycin (p < .05) or tetracycline (p < .004). These results provide preliminary support for the traditional folkloric claim that the plant willow herb possesses antibacterial properties against a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Given that whole plant extract was utilized for this study, further investigations are warranted to determine which specific part of the plant (i.e., leaves, stem, roots, and flowers) possess the antibacterial properties.
TI  - Identification of Streptomyces sp. KH29, which produces an antibiotic substance processing an inhibitory activity against multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - The Actinomycete strain KH29 is antagonistic to the multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Based on the diaminopimelic acid (DAP) type, and the morphological and physiological characteristics observed through the use of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), KH29 was confirmed as belonging to the genus Streptomyces. By way of its noted 16S rDNA nucleotide sequences, KH29 was found to have a relationship with Streptomyces cinnamonensis. The production of an antibiotic from this strain was found to be most favorable when cultured with glucose, polypeptone, and yeast extract (PY) medium for 6 days at 27 degrees C. The antibiotic produced was identified, through comparisons with reported spectral data including MS and NMR as a cyclo(L-tryptophanyl-L-tryptophanyl). Cyclo(L-Trp-L-Trp), from the PY cultures of KH29, was seen to be highly effective against 41 of 49 multidrugresistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Furthermore, cyclo(LTrp- L-Trp) had antimicrobial activity against Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Aspergillus niger, and Candida albicans, However, it was ineffective against Streptomyces murinus.
TI  - Effect of flash-heat treatment on antimicrobial activity of breastmilk.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The World Health Organization recommends human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive mothers in resource-poor regions heat-treat expressed breastmilk during periods of increased maternal-to-child transmission risk. Flash-heat, a "low tech" pasteurization method, inactivates HIV, but effects on milk protein bioactivity are unknown. The objectives were to measure flash-heat's effect on antimicrobial properties of lactoferrin, lysozyme, and whole milk and on the digestive resistance of lactoferrin and lysozyme. METHODS: Flash-heated and unheated breastmilk aliquots from HIV-positive mothers in South Africa were "spiked" with Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli and then cultured for 0, 3, and 6 hours. Lysozyme and lactoferrin activities were determined by lysis of Micrococcus luteus cells and inhibition of enteropathogenic E. coli, respectively, measured spectrophotometrically. Percentages of proteins surviving in vitro digestion, lactoferrin and lysozyme activity, and bacteriostatic activity of whole milk in heated versus unheated samples were compared. RESULTS: There was no difference in rate of growth of E. coli or S. aureus in flash-heated versus unheated whole milk (p = 0.61 and p = 0.96, respectively). Mean (95% confidence interval) antibacterial activity of lactoferrin was diminished 11.1% (7.8%, 14.3%) and that of lysozyme by up to 56.6% (47.1%, 64.5%) by flash-heat. Digestion of lysozyme was unaffected (p = 0.12), but 25.4% less lactoferrin survived digestion (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: In summary, flash-heat resulted in minimally decreased lactoferrin and moderately decreased lysozyme bioactivity, but bacteriostatic activity of whole milk against representative bacteria was unaffected. This suggests flash-heated breastmilk likely has a similar profile of resistance to bacterial contamination as that of unheated milk. Clinical significance of the decreased bioactivity should be tested in clinical trials.
TI  - Biological and docking studies of topoisomerase IV inhibition by thiosemicarbazides.
AB  - 4-Benzoyl-1-(4-methyl-imidazol-5-yl)-carbonylthiosemicarbazide (1) was synthesized, and its antibacterial and type IIA topoisomerase (DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV) activity evaluated. (1) was found to have high therapeutic potential against opportunistic Gram-positive bacteria, and inhibitory activity against topoisomerase IV (IC(50)=90 muM) but not against DNA gyrase. An increase in activity against topoisomerase IV (IC(50)=14 muM) was observed when the imidazole moiety of (1) was replaced with the indole group in 4-benzoyl-1-(indol-2-yl)-carbonylthiosemicarbazide (2). However, (2) showed only weak antibacterial activity. Although the results of the bacterial type IIA topoisomerases inhibition study did not parallel antibacterial activities, our observations strongly imply that a 4-benzoylthiosemicarbazide scaffold can be developed into an efficient Gram-positive antibacterial targeting topoisomerase IV. The difference in activity against type IIA topoisomerases between (1) and (2) was further investigated by docking studies, which suggested that these compounds target the ATP binding pocket.
TI  - Bacterial tolerance to silver nanoparticles (SNPs): aeromonas punctata isolated from sewage environment.
AB  - Use of silver nanoparticles (SNPs) is increasing in a large number of consumer products. Thus, the possible build-up of the nanoparticles in the environment is becoming a major concern. Aeromonas punctata isolated from sewage showed tolerance to 200 mug/ml SNPs. The growth kinetics data for A. punctata treated with nanoparticles were similar to those in the absence of nanoparticles. There was a reduction in the amount of exopolysaccharides (EPS) in bacterial culture supernatant after nanoparticle-supernatant interaction. EPS capping of the nanoparticles was confirmed by UV-visible, XRD and comparative FTIR analysis. The EPS-capped SNPs showed less toxicity to Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus compared to the uncapped ones. The study suggests capping of nanoparticles by bacterially produced EPS as a probable physiological defense mechanism.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the latex of Argemone ochroleuca Sweet.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antibacterial effect of the crude latex of Argemone ochroleuca (A. ochroleuca) as antibacterial potential against a range of human pathogenic bacteria. METHODS: This study was carried out at King Khalid University, Abha, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from January to March 2010. Seventeen ml of fresh latex from A. ochroleuca Sweet was collected, and the antibacterial activity of crude and diluted latex were examined using one ml of standardized inoculum suspension, and using the agar diffusion method test against Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus. All inoculated plates were incubated aerobically at 290C for 48 hours. The diameter of the zones of inhibition was measured to the nearest mm. RESULTS: The crude latex of A. ochroleuca exhibited a potent antibacterial effect on all bacterial strains examined. The zones of inhibition against the tested bacteria were found in the range of 9.30 - 40.3 mm along with their respective minimum inhibitory concentration values 100 ul/ml. CONCLUSION: The observable inhibition on selected bacteria by latex of A. ochroleuca makes it a promising alternative as a potential source of natural antibacterial.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of the essential oils of commonly consumed medicinal herbs  using an in vitro model.
AB  - The chemical composition and antibacterial activity of essential oils from 10 commonly consumed herbs: Citrus aurantium, C. limon, Lavandula angustifolia, Matricaria chamomilla, Mentha piperita, M. spicata, Ocimum basilicum, Origanum vulgare, Thymus vulgaris and Salvia officinalis have been determined. The antibacterial activity of these oils and their main components; i.e. camphor, carvacrol, 1,8-cineole, linalool, linalyl acetate, limonene, menthol, a-pinene, b-pinene, and thymol were assayed against the human pathogenic bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Micrococcus flavus, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis, S. epidermidis, S. typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus. The highest and broadest activity was shown by O. vulgare oil. Carvacrol had the highest antibacterial activity among the tested components.
TI  - Abyssomicin I, a modified polycyclic polyketide from Streptomyces sp. CHI39.
AB  - Abyssomicin I (1), a new modified polycyclic polyketide, was isolated from the culture extract of a soil-derived Streptomyces sp. The structure of 1 was elucidated by interpretation of NMR and other spectroscopic data. The stereochemistry of the new compound was assigned by NOE analysis, chemical derivatization, and application of the modified Mosher method. While 1 was inactive against bacteria and yeasts, the oxidized derivative 7 showed weak activities against gram-positive bacteria. Compounds 1 and 7 exhibited inhibitory effects on tumor cell invasion with IC(50) values of 11 and 0.21 muM, respectively.
TI  - Screening of the constituents, antimicrobial and antioxidant activity of endemic  Origanum hypericifolium O. Schwartz & P.H. Davis.
AB  - The chemical compositions, total phenol content, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities with oxidant status of the essential oil from an endemic Turkish species, Origanum hypericifolium, were investigated. Steam distillation (SD) was used to isolate the essential oils, and the chemical analyses were performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The antimicrobial activity was tested by agar disc diffusion method against Morganella morganii (clinic isolate), Micrococcus flavus (clinic isolate), Micrococcus luteus NRLL B-4375, Proteus vulgaris RSKK 96026, Escherichia coli ATCC 11230, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Yersinia enterecolitica RSKK 1501, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, S. aureus ATCC 25933, S. aureus ATCC 12598, S. aureus (clinic isolate), MRSA 1 (clinic isolate), MRSA 2 (clinic isolate), MRSA 3 (clinic isolate) and MRSA 4 (clinic isolate). The major compounds found in volatiles of O. hypericifolium were p-cymene, carvacrol and gamma-terpinene. Results showed that O. hypericifolium has the potential for being used in food and medicine because of its antioxidant and antibacterial activity.
TI  - Rapid differentiation of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and other coagulase-negative staphylococci and meticillin susceptibility testing directly from growth-positive blood cultures by multiplex real-time PCR.
AB  - This study evaluated a multiplex real-time PCR method specific for the mecA, femA-SA and femA-SE genes for rapid identification of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and non-S. epidermidis coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), and meticillin susceptibility testing directly in positive blood cultures that grew Gram-positive cocci in clusters. A total of 100 positive blood cultures produced: 39 S. aureus [12 meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 31% of all the S. aureus]; 30 S. epidermidis (56.6% of the CoNS), 8 Staphylococcus capitis (15.1%), 3 Staphylococcus saprophyticus (5.7%), 4 Staphylococcus hominis (7.5%), 3 Staphylococcus haemolyticus (5.7%), 2 Staphylococcus warneri (3.8%), 1 Staphylococcus cohnii (1.9%) and 2 unidentified Staphylococcus spp. (3.8%); and 1 Micrococcus luteus in pure culture. Two blood cultures had no growth on subculture and five blood cultures grew mixed CoNS. For the 95 blood cultures with pure growth or no growth on subculture, there was very good agreement between real-time PCR and the BD Phoenix identification system for staphylococcal species categorization in S. aureus, S. epidermidis and non-S. epidermidis CoNS and meticillin-resistance determination (Cohen's unweighted kappa coefficient kappa=0.882). All MRSA and meticillin-susceptible S. aureus were correctly identified by mecA amplification. PCR amplification of mecA was more sensitive for direct detection of meticillin-resistant CoNS in positive blood cultures than testing with the BD Phoenix system. There were no major errors when identifying staphylococcal isolates and their meticillin susceptibility within 2.5 h. Further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical benefit of using such a rapid test on the consumption of glycopeptide antibiotics and the alteration of empiric therapy in the situation of positive blood cultures growing staphylococci, and the respective clinical outcomes.
TI  - Antimicrobial and anticancer efficacy of antineoplastic agent capped gold nanoparticles.
AB  - Synthesis of thioguanine (TG)-capped Au nanoparticles (Au@TG) and their enhanced  in vitro antimicrobial and anticancer efficacy against Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E. coli, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger and Hep2 cancer cell (Human epidermiod cell) have been reported. The nature of binding between 6-TG and the gold nanoparticles via complexation is investigated using ultraviolet-visible spectrum, cyclic voltammetry, transmission electron microscopy, fluorescence and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The present experimental studies suggests that Au@TG are more potential than TG towards antimicrobial and anticancer activities. Hence, gold nanoparticles have the potential to be used as effective carriers for anticancer drug.
TI  - Lycopersicon esculentum seeds: an industrial byproduct as an antimicrobial agent.
AB  - Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato) fruit is a widely studied matrix. However, only  few works focus their attention on its seeds, which constitute a major byproduct of the tomato processing industry. In this study the antimicrobial potential of ten different tomato seed extracts from "Bull's heart" and "Cherry" varieties were analyzed against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis and Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative (Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium) bacteria and fungi (Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus and Trichophyton rubrum). Regarding antibacterial capacity, the different extracts were revealed to be active only against Gram-positive bacteria, E. faecalis being the most susceptible one (MIC: 2.5-10 mg/mL). Concerning antifungal activity, "Bull's heart" extracts were the most active. In a general way C. albicans was the most susceptible species (MIC: 5-10 mg/mL). The chemical composition of the extracts was also pursued, concerning organic acids, phenolics and fatty acids, in order to establish a possible relationship with the observed antimicrobial effect.
TI  - Chemical composition and antibacterial activity of essential oils of Lantana camara, Ageratum houstonianum and Eupatorium adenophorum.
AB  - Essential oils have applications in folk medicine, food preservation, and as feed additives. The essential oils of Lantana camara Linn. (Verbenaceae), Ageratum houstonianum Mill. (Asteraceae) and Eupatorium adenophorum Spreng. (Asteraceae) were analyzed by Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS). In L. camara oil, of the total identified (83.91%) volatile constituents, five constituents [3,7,11-trimethyl-1,6,10-dodecatriene (28.86%), beta-caryophyllene (12.28%), zingiberene (7.63%), gamma-curcumene (7.50%) and alpha-humulene (3.99%)] represented the major ones. In A. houstonianum oil, among the total identified volatile constituents (94.51%), three [precocene-II (52.64%), precocene-I (22.45%) and beta-caryophyllene (9.66%)] represented the major ones. In E. adenophorum oil, of the total identified volatile constituents (84.95%), six [1-napthalenol (17.50%), alpha-bisabolol (9.53%), bornyl acetate (8.98%), beta-bisabolene (6.16%), germacrene-D (5.74%) and alpha- phellandrene (3.85%)] represented the major ones. The antibacterial activity expressed as Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) (microg/mL) was determined by the broth dilution method. The essential oil of E. adenophorum had antibacterial activity against Arthrobacter protophormiae, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Rhodococcus rhodochrous, and Staphylococcus aureus with MBC values of 200, 100, 100, 12.5, and 200, respectively. The essential oil of A. houstonianum showed antibacterial activity against M. luteus and R. rhodochrous with MBC of 100 and 12.5, but not against A. protophormiae, E. coli, and S. aureus. The essential oil of L. camara showed antibacterial activity against A. protophormiae, M. luteus, R. rhodochrous and S. aureus with MBC of 50, 25, 12.5, and 200, respectively, but not against E. coli. MBC was lowest for R. rhodochrous for all the three essential oils.
TI  - Aureocins 4185, bacteriocins produced by Staphylococcus aureus 4185: potential application in food preservation.
AB  - In the present study, the bacteriocins produced by Staphylococcus aureus 4185, a  strain isolated from bovine mastitis, were purified and partially characterized. After purification by ammonium sulfate precipitation, cation-exchange chromatography, and five runs of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), antimicrobial activity was recovered with 40% and 80% isopropanol, suggesting that more than one antimicrobial peptide, named aureocins 4185, is produced by S. aureus 4185. Mass spectrometry analyses revealed three peptides eluted with 40% isopropanol: peptide A (2,305.3 +/-1.5 Da), peptide B (2,327.3 +/-1.5 Da), and peptide C (3,005.5 +/-1.5 Da), and two peptides eluted with 80% isopropanol: peptide D (6,413.5 +/-1.5 Da) and peptide E (12,834.5 +/-1.5 Da). Although five peptides have been detected, only four small peptide sequences were obtained by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF)/TOF mass spectrometry analyses: SLLEQFTGK (eluted with 40% isopropanol), ALLYDER, NNTSHNLPLGWFNVK, and NNLAQGTFNATK (eluted with 80% isopropanol). The sequences SLLEQFTGK and ALLYDER revealed identity with hypothetical peptides with unknown function. The sequences NNTSHNLPLGWFNVK and NNLAQGTFNATK showed similarity to a segment of a precursor of staphylococcal autolysins. The antimicrobial activity detected in the supernatant of strain 4185 proved to be resistant to heat treatment at 65 degrees C; however, treatment at 80 degrees C abolished completely its antimicrobial properties. The concentrated supernatant containing aureocins 4185 exhibited a strong bacteriolytic activity toward Micrococcus luteus ATCC 4698. Additionally, aureocins 4185 exhibited antagonistic activity against important foodborne pathogens, including Listeria monocytogenes, thus showing a potential application in food preservation.
TI  - Linum usitatissimum (linseed/flaxseed) fixed oil: antimicrobial activity and efficacy in bovine mastitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: In vitro antimicrobial activity and in vivo therapeutic efficacy of L. usitatissimum (linseed/flaxseed) fixed oil in bovine mastitis were investigated. METHOD: In vitro antimicrobial activity of L. usitatissimum fixed oil was evaluated against a number of microorganisms by disc diffusion method and MIC determination. The in vivo efficacy of the oil was evaluated in nine mastitis-affected cows divided into three groups (three in each group), following once-a-day intramammary infusion of oil, cefoperazone or an oil-cefoperazone combination for 7 days and by monitoring the California mastitis test score, somatic cell count and microbial count in milk samples. RESULTS: The in vitro antimicrobial activity of the oil against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae and Escherichia coli was comparable to that of cefoperazone while the antimicrobial activity against Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus luteus and Candida albicans, was greater than that of cefoperazone. In the in vivo study, the oil exhibited significant reduction in the California mastitis test score and somatic cell count in milk samples from infected udders following 7 days of intramammary administration suggesting its anti-inflammatory effect. The microbial count in milk samples was also reduced significantly following oil treatment. The effects were comparable to the treatment by cefoperazone (Mastiwock) alone or in combination with the oil. Apparently, the anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties of the oil contribute to its therapeutic efficacy in mastitis; the oil could be used as an alternative treatment for bovine mastitis CONCLUSION: The results suggest possible therapeutic potential of L. usitatissimum fixed oil in bovine mastitis.
TI  - Synthesis and anti-microbial screening of novel schiff bases of 3-amino-2-methyl  quinazolin 4-(3H)-one.
AB  - In the present study, novel Schiff bases were synthesized by condensation of 3-amino-2-methyl quinazolin-4-(3H)-ones with different aromatic aldehydes. The 3-amino-2-methyl quinazolin-4-(3H)-one was synthesized from anthranilic acid via the 2-methyl benzoxazin-4-one. The chemical structures of the synthesized compounds were confirmed by means of Infrared (IR), (1)H-NMR, (13)C-NMR, Mass spectral, and Elemental analysis. These compounds were screened for anti-bacterial (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 9144, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 155, Micrococcus luteus ATCC 4698, Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 2853, and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 11298)) and anti-fungal (Aspergillus niger ATCC 9029 and Aspergillus fumigatus ATCC 46645) activities, using the paper disk diffusion technique. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the compounds were also determined by the agar streak dilution method. Most of the synthesized compounds exhibited significant anti-bacterial and anti-fungal activities. Among the synthesized compounds, 3-(4-hydroxy benzylideneamino)-2-methyl quinazolin-4(3H)-one 4g and 4c was found to exhibit the highest anti-bacterial activity and 3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy benzylideneamino)-2-methyl quinazolin-4(3H)-one 4k exhibited the highest anti-fungal activity.
TI  - Synthesis, nematicidal and antimicrobial activity of 3-(5-3-methyl-5-[(3-methyl-7-5-[2-(aryl)-4-oxo-1,3-thiazolan-3-yl]-1,3,4-thiadiaz ol-2-ylbenzo[b]furan-5-yl)methyl]benzo[b]furan-7-yl-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)-2-(ary l)-1,3-thiazolan-4-one.
AB  - A new series of 3-(5-3-methyl-5-[(3-methyl-7-5-[2-(aryl)-4-oxo-1,3-thiazolan-3-yl]-1,3,4-thiadiaz ol-2-ylbenzo[b]furan-5-yl)methyl]benzo[b]furan-7-yl-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)-2-(ary l)-1,3-thiazolan-4-one 5a-j has been synthesized by the reaction of N2-[(E)-1-(4-methylphenyl)methylidene]-5-(3-methyl-5-[3-methyl-7-(5-[(E)-1-(4-met hylphenyl)methylidene]amino-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)benzo[b]furan-5-yl]methylbenzo[ b]furan-7-yl)-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-amine 4a-j with thioglycolic acid. Chemical structures of all the new compounds were established by their IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, MS and elemental data. The 5a-j have been assayed for their nematicidal activity against Ditylenchus myceliophagus and Caenorhabditis elegans by aqueous in vitro screening technique. The screened data reveal that, the 5e is most effective against D. myceliophagus and C. elegans with 50% lethal dose (LD(50)) of 170 and 190 ppm, respectively and is almost equal to the activity of standard levamisole. The 5h and 5j are also most active against C. elegans with LD(50) of 200 ppm and D. myceliophagus with LD(50) of 190 ppm, respectively. Further, the 5a-j were screened for their antibacterial activity against three representative, Gram-positive bacteria viz. Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538p and Micrococcus luteus IFC 12708, and three Gram-negative bacteria viz. Proteus vulgaris ATCC 3851, Salmonella typhimurium ATCC 14028 and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and also screened for their antifungal activity against four fungal organisms viz. Candida albicans ATCC 10231, Aspergillus fumigatus HIC 6094, Trichophyton rubrum IFO 9185 and Trichophyton mentagrophytes IFO 40996. Most of these new compounds showed appreciable activity against the test bacteria and fungi, and emerged as potential molecules for further development.
TI  - Blechnum orientale Linn - a fern with potential as antioxidant, anticancer and antibacterial agent.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Blechnum orientale Linn. (Blechnaceae) is used ethnomedicinally for the treatment of various skin diseases, stomach pain, urinary bladder complaints and sterilization of women. The aim of the study was to evaluate antioxidant, anticancer and antibacterial activity of five solvent fractions obtained from the methanol extract of the leaves of Blechnum orientale Linn. METHODS: Five solvent fractions were obtained from the methanol extract of B. orientale through successive partitioning with petroleum ether, chloroform, ethyl acetate, butanol and water. Total phenolic content was assessed using Folin-Ciocalteu's method. The antioxidant activity was determined by measuring the scavenging activity of DPPH radicals. Cytotoxic activity was tested against four cancer cell lines and a non-malignant cell using MTT assay. Antibacterial activity was assessed using the disc diffusion and broth microdilution assays. Standard phytochemical screening tests for saponins, tannins, terpenoids, flavonoids and alkaloids were also conducted. RESULTS: The ethyl acetate, butanol and water fractions possessed strong radical scavenging activity (IC50 8.6-13.0 microg/ml) and cytotoxic activity towards human colon cancer cell HT-29 (IC50 27.5-42.8 microg/ml). The three extracts were also effective against all Gram-positive bacteria tested: Bacillus cereus, Micrococcus luteus, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Stapylococcus epidermidis(minimum inhibitory concentration MIC 15.6-250 mug/ml; minimum bactericidal concentration MBC 15.6-250 microg/ml). Phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of flavonoids, terpenoids and tannins. Ethyl acetate and butanol fractions showed highest total phenolic content (675-804 mg gallic acid equivalent/g). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that this fern is a potential candidate to be used as an antioxidant agent, for colon cancer therapy and for treatment of MRSA infections and other MSSA/Gram-positive bacterial infectious diseases.
TI  - Biosurfactants as agents to reduce adhesion of pathogenic bacteria to polystyrene surfaces: effect of temperature and hydrophobicity.
AB  - Polystyrene surfaces were conditioned with surfactin and rhamnolipid biosurfactants and then assessed regarding the attachment of Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Micrococcus luteus. The effect of different temperatures (35, 25, and 4 degrees C) on the anti-adhesive activity was also studied. Microbial adhesion to solvents and contact angle measurements were performed to characterize bacteria and material surfaces. The results showed that surfactin was able to inhibit bacterial adhesion in all the conditions analyzed, giving a 63-66% adhesion reduction in the bacterial strains at 4 degrees C. Rhamnolipid promoted a slight decrease in the attachment of S. aureus. The anti-adhesive activity of surfactin increased with the decrease in temperature, showing that this is an important parameter to be considered in surface conditioning tests. Surfactin showed good potential as an anti-adhesive compound that can be explored to protect surfaces from microbial contamination.
TI  - Involvement of Manduca sexta peptidoglycan recognition protein-1 in the recognition of bacteria and activation of prophenoloxidase system.
AB  - Although the importance of peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) in detecting bacteria and promoting immunity is well recognized in Drosophila melanogaster and other insect species, such a role has not yet been experimentally established for PGRPs in the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta. In this study, we purified M. sexta PGRP1 from the baculovirus-insect cell expression system, tested its association with peptidoglycans and intact bacteria, and explored its possible link with the prophenoloxidase activation system in larval hemolymph. Sequence comparison suggested that PGRP1 is not an amidase and lacks residues for interacting with the carboxyl group of meso-diaminopimelic acid-peptidoglycans (DAP-PGs). M. sexta PGRP1 gene was constitutively expressed at a low level in fat body, and the mRNA concentration became much higher after an injection of Escherichia coli. Consistently, the protein concentration in larval plasma increased in a time-dependent manner after the immune challenge. Purified recombinant PGRP1 specifically bound to soluble DAP-PG of E. coli but not to soluble Lys-type PG of Staphylococcus aureus. In addition, this recognition protein completely bound to insoluble PGs from Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus megaterium and Bacillus subtilis, whereas its association with the bacterial cells was low even though their peptidoglycans are exposed on the cell surface. After PGRP1 had been added to plasma of naive larvae in the absence of microbial elicitor, there was a concentration-dependent increase in prophenoloxidase activation. Phenoloxidase activity, as usual, increased after the plasma was incubated with peptidoglycans or bacterial cells. These increases became more prominent when insoluble M. luteus or B. megaterium PG or soluble E. coli PG and PGRP1 were both present. Statistic analysis suggested a synergistic effect caused by interaction between PGRP1 and these PGs. Taken together, these results indicated that PGRP1 is a member of the M. sexta prophenoloxidase activation system, which recognizes peptidoglycans from certain bacteria and initiates the host defense response. The unexplained difference between the purified PGs and intact bacteria clearly reflects our general lack of understanding of PGRP1-mediated recognition and how it leads to proPO activation.
TI  - Antimicrobial, antiviral and cytotoxic activity of extracts and constituents from Polygonum spectabile Mart.
AB  - Polygonum spectabile is used in Brazil for treatment of several infection diseases. Extracts and constituents isolated from this species were evaluated for cytotoxicity and effects on 15 bacterias and yeasts as well on 4 viruses strains (HHV-1, VACV-WR, EMCV, DEN-2). Less polar extracts were effective against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtillis, Micrococcus luteus, M. canis and Tricophyton mentagrophytes and T. rubrum. Two known chalcones and 3-O-beta-D-glucosyl-beta-sitosterol were isolated. The ethanol extract was the only one to show antiviral activity (CE50 < 30 mug/ml). One chalcone has inhibited the growth of several bacteria and was significantly active against dermathophytes. The 3 compounds isolated have shown moderate cytotoxicity against Vero and LLCMK(2) cells (CC(50) < 50 mug/ml). These results support the use of P. spectabile as antimicrobial agent.
TI  - Streptomyces caeruleatus sp. nov., with dark blue diffusible pigment.
AB  - An actinomycete, designated strain GIMN4.002(T), was isolated from a tomato rhizosphere soil sample in Guangzhou, China. The strain produces white aerial mycelium and dark blue diffusible pigment on Gause's synthetic agar, and microscopic observation revealed that it produces looped chains of spiny spores. Morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics of the strain are typical of the genus Streptomyces. Melanin was produced and antibacterial activity was detected against Gram-positive micro-organisms, such as Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus aureus. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain GIMN4.002(T) had highest similarity (99.4 %) to Streptomyces lincolnensis B91; however, DNA-DNA relatedness between strain GIMN4.002(T) and S. lincolnensis NBRC 13054(T) was only 32.17 %. Further, the morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics of strain GIMN4.002(T) are distinct from S. lincolnensis and other species of the genus Streptomyces with which this strain has high 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity (98-99 %). On the basis of the physiological and molecular properties observed, it is proposed that strain GIMN4.002(T) represents a novel species of the genus Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomyces caeruleatus sp. nov. is proposed, with GIMN4.002(T) (=CCTCC M 208213(T) =NRRL B-24802(T)) as the type strain.
TI  - Essential oil from the underground parts of Laserpitium zernyi: potential source  of alpha-bisabolol and its antimicrobial activity.
AB  - The composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil from the underground parts (roots and rhizomes) of Laserpitium zernyi Hayek (Apiaceae) were investigated. The pale blue essential oil, obtained by hydrodistillation, was analyzed by GC and GC-MS. Forty-three compounds were identified (94.3% of total oil). The main constituent, beside alpha-pinene (31.6%) was alpha-bisabolol (30.9%), so this oil may be a novel potential natural source of this sesquiterpene alcohol. The antimicrobial activity was tested using the microdilution method against Gram (+) bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis), Gram (-) bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli), and two strains of yeast (Candida albicans). L. zernyi oil showed significant antibacterial activity against S. epidermidis, S. aureus and M. luteus, but lower activities against the other tested strains.
TI  - Antimicrobial and antileishmanial studies of novel (2E)-3-(2-chloro-6-methyl/methoxyquinolin-3-yl)-1-(aryl)prop-2-en-1-ones.
AB  - Thirty eight heterocyclic chalcones were synthesized by condensing formylquinolines with diverse methyl arylketones. The target compounds were characterized by spectroscopic techniques (NMR, IR, MS) and elemental analysis. The X-ray crystallographic study of (2E)-3-(2-chloro-6-methylquinolin-3-yl)-1-(2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzodioxin-6-yl)prop- 2-en-1-one (1p) was also performed for the structure confirmation. The title compounds were screened for anti-microbial and antileishmanial activities. The compounds 1c-e, 1g, 1j-m, 1p, 1r-s, 2g, 2j-p, and 2r-s were found potentially active antileishmanial agents, while 1f-i, 1l, 1o-p, 2f-i, 2l, and 2o-p showed remarkable antibacterial activity. Only compounds 1g and 2g-h exhibited significant antifungal activity.
TI  - Synthesis, spectroscopic and biological studies on the new symmetric Schiff base  derived from 2,6-diformyl-4-methylphenol with N-aminopyrimidine.
AB  - A phenol based novel Schiff base polydentate symmetric ligand was prepared. The complexes were prepared by reacting ligand and the metal chlorides of Cu (II), Ni(II), Co(II) and Fe(II) in methanol to get a series of mononuclear complexes. The complexes were characterized by elemental analyses, conductivity measurements, magnetic susceptibility data, IR, UV-Vis, NMR and API-ES mass spectral data. The mononuclear structure of the complexes was confirmed on the basis of elemental analyses, magnetic susceptibility and API-ES mass spectral data. The ligand and all the metal complexes were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against four Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, S. aureus ATCC 25923, Bacillus cereus ATCC 7064 and Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9345), one Gram-negative bacterium (Escherichia coli ATCC 4230), and three yeast (Candida albicans ATCC 14053, Candida krusei ATCC 6258 and Candida parapsilosis ATCC 22019) strains. Therefore, newly synthesized the ligand and two complexes [(Cu(II) and Co(II)] showed good biological activity against all tested bacteria and yeast strains.
TI  - Spectrum of activity, mutation rates, synergistic interactions, and the effects of pH and serum proteins for fusidic acid (CEM-102).
AB  - Fusidic acid (CEM-102) is a steroidal antimicrobial agent with focused Gram-positive activity that acts by preventing bacterial protein synthesis via interacting with elongation factor G. A collection of 114 wild-type isolates (> 80 species) was used to define the contemporary limits of fusidic acid spectrum against Gram-positive and Gram-negative species. Reference broth microdilution and anaerobic agar dilution methods were performed. Modifications of standardized test methods included adding 10% human serum and adjusting the medium pH to 5, 6, and 8. Synergy was assessed by the checkerboard method and time-kill studies. Mutational rates to resistance were determined at 4 x, 8 x, and 16 x MIC. Against Gram-positive pathogens, fusidic acid MIC values ranged from 0.06 to 32 microg/mL with the greatest potency against Staphylococcus aureus, Corynebacterium spp., and Micrococcus luteus (MIC results, 0.25, < or = 0.12, and < or = 0.5 microg/mL, respectively). Enterococci and streptococci were less susceptible (MIC ranges, 2-8 and 16-32 microg/mL, respectively). Fusidic acid activity against Gram-negative species was more limited (all MIC values, > or = 2 microg/mL) except for Empedobacter brevis, Moraxella catarrhalis and Neisseria meningitidis. A 4-fold increase in fusidic acid MIC results was observed when 10% serum was added to the broth. Decreasing medium pH to 5.0 to 6.0 negated the protein binding effects. Among the 8 antimicrobial combinations tested, gentamicin and rifampin enhanced the activity when combined with fusidic acid (no antagonism). Fusidic acid in vitro activity was most improved when combined with rifampin. Single-step mutational rates ranged from 1.2 x 10(-6) for 4x MIC to 9.8 x 10(-8) for 16 x MIC. In conclusion, these in vitro results for fusidic acid tested against contemporary strains confirm a persisting antimicrobial spectrum, especially against staphylococci and some other Gram-positive species.
TI  - Expression of Acc-Royalisin gene from royal jelly of Chinese honeybee in Escherichia coli and its antibacterial activity.
AB  - Royalisin is an antibacterial peptide found in Royal Jelly. Two gene fragments of Chinese honeybee (Apis cerana cerana) head, 280 bp cDNA encoding pre-pro-Acc-royalisin (PPAR) of 95 amino acid residues, and 165 bp cDNA encoding mature Acc-royalisin (MAR) of 51 amino acid residues were cloned into the pGEX-4T-2 vector. They were then transformed individually into Escherichia coli for expression. Two expressed fusion proteins, glutathione S-transferase (GST)-PPAR of 36 kDa and GST-MAR of 32 kDa were obtained, which were cross reacted with GST antibody accounting for up to 16.3% and 15.4% of bacterial protein, respectively. In addition, 41% of GST-PPAR and nearly 100% of GST-MAR were soluble proteins. Both lysates of the two purified fusion proteins displayed antibacterial activities, similar to that of nisin against Gram-positive bacteria strains, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Micrococcus luteus. MAR peptide released from the thrombin-cleaved GST-MAR fusion protein has a stronger antibacterial activity than that of GST-MAR fusion protein.
TI  - Antineoplastic agents. 573. isolation and structure of papilistatin from the papilionid butterfly Byasa polyeuctes termessa.
AB  - Bioassay-guided separation of an extract of the wings from a Taiwan butterfly, Byasa polyeuctes termessa, allowed isolation of a new cancer cell growth inhibitor designated papilistatin (1a). The structure was determined by analysis of 1D and 2D NMR spectra and by HRMS. Against a panel of six human and the murine P388 leukemia cancer cell lines, papilistatin exhibited cancer cell growth inhibition with GI(50)'s of 0.093-3.5 microg/mL. Papilistatin was also found to have antibacterial activity.
TI  - Discorhabdins from the Korean marine sponge Sceptrella sp.
AB  - Two new pyrroloiminoquinone alkaloids of the discorhabdin class, along with 12 compounds including one previously described synthetic derivative of the same and related skeletal classes, were isolated from the sponge Sceptrella sp., collected from Gageodo, Korea. The structures of these new compounds, designated as (-)-3-dihydrodiscorhabdin D (11) and (-)-discorhabdin Z (12), were determined by combined spectroscopic analyses. Compound 12 possesses an unusual hemiaminal group among the discorhabdin alkaloids. These compounds exhibited moderate to significant cytotoxicity, antibacterial activity, and inhibitory activity against sortase A.
TI  - AiCTL-6, a novel C-type lectin from bay scallop Argopecten irradians with a long  C-type lectin-like domain.
AB  - C-type lectins are a superfamily of carbohydrate-recognition proteins which play  crucial roles in the innate immunity. In this study, a novel C-type lectin gene from scallop Argopecten irradians (designated as AiCTL-6) was cloned by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) approach based on expression sequence tag (EST) analysis. The full-length cDNA of AiCTL-6 was 1080 bp. The open reading frame encoded a polypeptide of 307 amino acids, including a signal sequence and a C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD) of 150 amino acid residues longer than any usual CTLD. It contained six conserved cysteine residues involved in the formation of three internal disulfide bridges and an EPD (Glu(269)-Pro(270)-Asp(271)) motif at the Ca(2+)-binding site 2. The deduced amino acid sequence of AiCTL-6 showed high similarity to members of C-type lectin superfamily. By fluorescent quantitative real-time PCR, AiCTL-6 mRNA was found mainly in hepatopancreas and gill, and marginally expressed in other tissues. After the scallops were challenged by Listonella anguillarum for 6 h, the mRNA expression of AiCTL-6 was up-regulated significantly to 7.2-fold compared to the blank group. While at 9 h post Micrococcus luteus challenge, its expression level was 60.1 times higher than that of the blank group. The functional activity of AiCTL-6 was investigated by recombination and expression of the cDNA fragment encoding its mature peptide in Escherichia coli Rosetta gami (DE3). The recombinant AiCTL-6 could agglutinate Gram-negative bacteria E. coli TOP10F', Gram-positive bacteria M. luteus and Staphylococcus aureus. These results collectively suggested that AiCTL-6, as a novel member of C-type lectin family, contributed to the host defense mechanisms against invading microorganism in A. irradians.
TI  - Isolation and identification of microbes associated with mobile phones in Dammam  in eastern Saudi Arabia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to determine microbial contamination of mobile phones in the city of Dammam, in the eastern region of Saudi Arabia, and identify the most important microbial species associated with these phones in order to take the necessary remedial measures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The analysis of a total of 202 samples was done to identify fungal and pathogenic bacteria isolates. Sterile swabs were firmly passed on the handset, the buttons and the screens of mobile phones, then inoculated into media of bacteria and fungi. Frequency distribution of isolates were calculated. RESULTS: There were 737 isolated of the following bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria sicca, Micrococcus luteus, Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus subtilis, and Enterobacter aerogenes at the rate of 56.58, 13.57, 8.01, 7.73, 6.51, 3.66, 2.85 and 1.09% respectively. There were fungal isolates as follows: Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus niger, Cladosporium sp., Penicillium spp., Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Rhizopus stolonifer, Aspergillus ochraceus at the rate of 29.07, 26.74, 20.93, 10.47, 6.98, 2.33, 2.33, 1.16%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that all mobile phones under consideration were infected by several microbes, most of which belonged to the natural flora of the human body as well as airborne fungi and soil. This means that it is necessary to sterilize hands after contact with a phone since it is a source of disease transmission.
TI  - Functional analysis of a putative holin-like peptide-coding gene in the genome of Bacillus licheniformis AnBa9.
AB  - BhlA, a putative holin-like protein of Bacillus licheniformis AnBa9 expressed in  Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) showed antibacterial activity against several gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Micrococcus luteus. Deletion analysis of bhlA suggests that a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, BhlATM is essential for antibacterial activity. Though the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of BhlA was sevenfold lower than BhlATM, transmembrane domain deleted construct (BhlATM) had no antibacterial activity. The expression of BhlA in E. coli was found to be toxic to cells. Therefore, the bhlA was cloned in yeast surface display vector pYD1 and expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The surface displayed yeast showed inhibition of several gram-positive bacteria. This recombinant yeast expressing BhlA may be used as biodrug for efficient control of multiple drug-resistant bacterial infections.
TI  - Cloning and functional characterization of a new antimicrobial peptide gene StCT1 from the venom of the scorpion Scorpiops tibetanus.
AB  - Scorpion has an innovative venom gland, which is an important determinant in contributing to its successful survival for more than 400 million years. Scorpion venom contains a diversity of bioactive peptides, which represent a tremendous hitherto unexplored resource for use in drug design and development. Here, StCT1, a new antimicrobial peptide gene, was screened and isolated from the venomous gland cDNA library of the scorpion Scorpiops tibetanus. The full-length cDNA of StCT1 is 369 nucleotides encoding the precursor that contains a putative 24-residue signal peptide, a presumed 14-residue mature peptide, and an uncommon 37-residue acidic propeptide at the C-terminus. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the synthetic StCT1 peptide against Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus were 12.5microg/ml and 100microg/ml, respectively. The MICs of StCT1 against clinical antibiotics-resistant bacterial strains, were 50-250microg/ml, 2-40 folds lower than those of penicillin. These results show that the antimicrobial peptide encoded by StCT1 gene from the venom of the scorpion S. tibetanus is a potential anti-infective polypeptide or lead compound, especially for treating antibiotics-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Static magnetic field exposure fails to affect the viability of different bacteria strains.
AB  - The viability of the microbes Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus circulans, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Salmonella enteritidis, Serratia marcescens, and Staphylococcus aureus was tested under static magnetic field exposure up to 24 h in either a homogeneous (159.2 +/- 13.4 mT) or three types of inhomogeneous static magnetic fields: (i) peak-to-peak magnetic flux density 476.7 +/- 0.1 mT with a lateral magnetic flux density gradient of 47.7 T/m, (ii) 12.0 +/- 0.1 mT with 1.2 T/m, or (iii) 2.8 +/- 0.1 mT with 0.3 T/m. Even the longest period of exposure failed to produce any effect in the growth of bacteriae that could be correlated with static magnetic field exposure.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of oregano (Origanum vulgare Linn.) against gram positive  bacteria.
AB  - The present investigation is focused on antibacterial potential of infusion, decoction and essential oil of oregano (Origanum vulgare) against 111 Gram-positive bacterial isolates belonging to 23 different species related to 3 genera. Infusion and essential oil exhibited antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus saprophyticus, S. aureus, Micrococcus roseus, M. kristinae, M. nishinomiyaensis, M. lylae, M. luteus, M. sedentarius, M. varians, Bacillus megaterium, B. thuringiensis, B. alvei, B. circulans, B. brevis, B. coagulans, B. pumilus, B. laterosporus, B. polymyxa, B. macerans, B. subtilis, B. firmus, B. cereus and B. lichiniformis. The infusion exhibited maximum activity against B. laterosporus (17.5 mm mean zone of inhibition+/-1.5 Standard deviation) followed by B. polymyxa (17.0 mm+/-2.0 SD) and essential oil of oregano exhibited maximum activity against S. saprophyticus (16.8 mm+/-1.8 SD) followed by B. circulans (14.5 mm+/-0.5 SD). While all these tested isolates were found resistant to decoction of oregano.
TI  - Structure and applications of a rhamnolipid surfactant produced in soybean oil waste.
AB  - Soybean oil soapstock was utilized as an alternative carbon source for the production of rhamnolipids by Pseudomonas aeruginosa LBI strain. The chemical composition and properties of the rhamnolipid mixture obtained were determined to define its potential applications. The chemical characterization of the rhamnolipid has revealed the presence of ten different homologues. The monorhamnolipid RhaC10C1) and the dirhamnolipid Rha2C10C10 were the main components of the mixture that showed predominance of 44% and 29%, respectively, after 144-h of cultivation. The biosurfactant was able to form stable emulsions with several hydrocarbons and showed excellent emulsification for soybean oil and chicken fat (100%). The rhamnolipid removed 67% of crude oil present in sand samples and presented antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus and Mucor miehei at 64 microg/mL and inhibition of Neurospora crassa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Micrococcus luteus at 256 microg/mL. The results demonstrated that the rhamnolipid produced in soybean oil soapstock can be useful in environmental and food industry applications.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of recombinant hCAP18/LL37 protein secreted from Pichia pastoris.
AB  - Human antimicrobial peptide CAP18/LL37 (hCAP18/LL37) was expressed in Pichia pastoris and its antibacterial activity was tested against pathogenic bacteria. The full length ORF of hCAP18/LL37 was cloned into the pPICZaA vector followed by integration into the genomic AOX1 gene of P. pastoris. Agar diffusion assay demonstrated that the different hCAP18/LL37 transformants showed various antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, and Salmonella gastroenteritis. The secreted form of hCAP18/LL37 exhibited its maximum activity after 72 h incubation with 2% methanol in MM media, not in BMM. This result suggests that the yeast secreted expression system can be used as a production tool of antimicrobial peptides for industrial or pharmaceutical application.
TI  - Effects of stingless bee and honey bee propolis on four species of bacteria.
AB  - We examined the antibacterial activities of several types of propolis, including  Africanized honey bee green propolis and propolis produced by meliponini bees. The antibacterial activity of green propolis against Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus aureus was superior to that of Melipona quadrifasciata and Scaptotrigona sp propolis. Only two samples of propolis (green propolis and Scaptotrigona sp propolis) were efficient against Escherichia coli. Melipona quadrifasciata propolis was better than green propolis and Scaptotrigona sp propolis against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We concluded that these resins have potential for human and veterinary medicine.
TI  - Report: antibiotic production by thermophilic Bacillus specie SAT-4.
AB  - Production of antimicrobial compounds seems to be a general phenomenon for most bacteria. The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among key microbial pathogens is increasing at an alarming rate worldwide. Current solutions involve development of a more rationale approach to antibiotic use and discover of new antimicrobials. Bacillus species produce a large number of biological compounds active against bacteria, fungi, protozoa and viruses. The process of production usually involves screening of wide range of microorganisms, testing and modification. Production is carried out using fermentation. Thermophilic spore-forming, gram positive, motile rod bacterial strains were isolated from the Thar Desserts, Sindh Province, Pakistan. These strains were screened and checked for antibacterial activity. The best activity was observed by SAT4 against Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeroginosa. The activity was only observed against gram positive bacteria and no activity was seen against Pseudomonas aeroginosa. Thermophilic Bacillus specie SAT4 was found to be active in the fermentation process to produce the antimicrobial agents. Further optimizations of different conditions (time of incubation, media, pH, glucose concentrations, nitrogen concentrations, and temperature) for antimicrobial production by the selected bacterial strain was performed. Agar diffusion assay was performed to evaluate the antibacterial activity. Optimum conditions for the production of antimicrobials by selected isolate were observed to be 48 hour, pH 5, temperature 55 degrees C, 2% glucose and 1.5% nitrogen concentration. This newly isolated bacterial strain has great potential for antimicrobial production at industrial scale.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of six pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) varieties and their relation to some of their pomological and phytonutrient characteristics.
AB  - Arils from six pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) varieties grown in the Mediterranean region of Turkey were tested for their antimicrobial properties by the agar diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) methods against seven bacteria: (Bacillus megaterium DSM 32, Pseudomonas aeruginosa DSM 9027, Staphylococcus aureus Cowan 1, Corynebacterium xerosis UC 9165, Escherichia coli DM, Enterococcus faecalis A10, Micrococcus luteus LA 2971), and threefungi (Kluvyeromyces marxianus A230, Rhodotorula rubra MC12, Candida albicans ATCC 1023). It has been observed that the pomegranate aril extracts had antimicrobial effect on all microorganisms, giving inhibition zones ranging in size from 13 to 26 mm. The MIC values for active pomegranate extracts ranged between 30 and >90 microg/mL. The results obtained appeared to confirm the antimicrobial potential of the Punica granatum varieties.
TI  - Linear alkylbenzene sulfonate tolerance in bacteria isolated from sediment of tropical water bodies polluted with detergents.
AB  - The discharge of untreated detergent-bearing waste introduces linear alklcylbenzene sulfonates (LAS) to the aquatic environment. The surfactant persists in some streams and rivers in Nigeria, some is adsorbed to suspended materials and end in the sediment of the receiving water bodies. In this study, bacteria isolated from sediments of some tropical detergent-effluent-polluted streams were tested for tolerance to LAS using the media dilution technique. LAS-tolerance was indicated by growth of the bacteria in the presence of the surfactant. The pH, concentrations of surfactant, population of heterotrophic bacteria and population of LAS-tolerant bacteria in the sediments were determined. A direct relationship (r = 0.9124) was found between the alkaline conditions (pH= 8.2-12.0) and high surfactant concentrations (45-132 mg/g) in the sediment. The sediments harboured a high population and a wide variety of bacteria; the populations of viable heterotrophic bacteria (VHB: 2.9 x 10(5) to 1.2 x 10(7) cfu/g) and LAS tolerant bacteria (LTB: 1.5 x 10(4) to 1.2 x 10(6) cfu/g) had a direct relationship (r = 0.9500). An inverse relationship resulted between each of them and the concentration of surfactant in the sediment, r(VHB/LAS) = -0.9303 and r(LTB/LAS) = -0.9143, respectively. Twelve bacteria species were isolated from the sediment: Alcaligenes odorans, Bacillus subtilis, Burkholderia cepacia, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter diversus, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Micrococcus albus, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcusfaecalis. Most of them were adapted to the surfactant with their maximum acceptable concentrations ranging between 0.03 and >1.0% (w/v). The sediments could serve as source of adapted organisms which can be used in bio-treatment of LAS-bearing waste.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil from Chaerophyllum aureum L. (Apiaceae).
AB  - The essential oils of the aerial parts and fruits of Chaerophyllum aureum L., collected from two mountains in Serbia, were analyzed by GC and GC/MS. Sabinene (18.5-31.6%), p-cymene (7.9-25.4%) and limonene (1.9-10.9%) were characterized as the main constituents. The oils were tested against six bacterial strains and one strain of yeast, Candida albicans. The highest antimicrobial activity was observed against the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and Micrococcus luteus, while of the Gram-negative strains, Escherichia coli was the most sensitive.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of Dodonaea viscosa using contact bioautography technique.
AB  - The crude ethanolic extract and n-hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, n-butanol and aqueous fractions of Dodonaea viscosa were analyzed for antibacterial potential against four Gram positive bacteria: Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, and three Gram negative bacteria: Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Preliminary screening showed inhibition against Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The thin layer chromatograms of the fractions were then subjected to contact bioautography, which showed inhibition zone at different R(f) values against Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, indicating the presence of antibacterial components. The MIC of each fraction was determined through a 96-well micro-titer plate method. The non-viability of the organisms was ascertained by determining the MBC of the fractions.
TI  - Leptoglycin: a new Glycine/Leucine-rich antimicrobial peptide isolated from the skin secretion of the South American frog Leptodactylus pentadactylus (Leptodactylidae).
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides are components of innate immunity that is the first-line defense against invading pathogens for a wide range of organisms. Here, we describe the isolation, biological characterization and amino acid sequencing of a novel neutral Glycine/Leucine-rich antimicrobial peptide from skin secretion of Leptodactylus pentadactylus named leptoglycin. The amino acid sequence of the peptide purified by RP-HPLC (C(18) column) was deduced by mass spectrometric de novo sequencing and confirmed by Edman degradation: GLLGGLLGPLLGGGGGGGGGLL. Leptoglycin was able to inhibit the growth of Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Citrobacter freundii with minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 8 microM, 50 microM, and 75 microM respectively, but it did not show antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus and Enterococcus faecalis), yeasts (Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis) and dermatophytes fungi (Microsporum canis and Trichophyton rubrum). No hemolytic activity was observed at the 2-200 microM range concentration. The amino acid sequence of leptoglycin with high level of glycine (59.1%) and leucine (36.4%) containing an unusual central proline suggests the existence of a new class of Gly/Leu-rich antimicrobial peptides. Taken together, these results suggest that this natural antimicrobial peptide could be a tool to develop new antibiotics.
TI  - Nagelamides Q and R, novel dimeric bromopyrrole alkaloids from sponges Agelas sp.
AB  - Two new dimeric bromopyrrole alkaloids, nagelamides Q (1) and R (2), have been isolated from Okinawan marine sponges of the genus Agelas (SS-1134 and SS-956, respectively), and the structures and stereochemistry were elucidated from spectroscopic data. Nagelamide Q (1) is a rare dimeric bromopyrrole alkaloid possessing a pyrrolidine ring, while nagelamide R (2) is the first bromopyrrole alkaloid having an oxazoline ring. Nagelamides Q (1) and R (2) showed antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Proliferation of antibiotic-producing bacteria and concomitant antibiotic production as the basis for the antibiotic activity of Jordan's red soils.
AB  - Anecdotes, both historical and recent, recount the curing of skin infections, including diaper rash, by using red soils from the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. Following inoculation of red soils isolated from geographically separate areas of Jordan, Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus aureus were rapidly killed. Over the 3-week incubation period, the number of specific types of antibiotic-producing bacteria increased, and high antimicrobial activity (MIC, approximately 10 microg/ml) was observed in methanol extracts of the inoculated red soils. Antibiotic-producing microorganisms whose numbers increased during incubation included actinomycetes, Lysobacter spp., and Bacillus spp. The actinomycetes produced actinomycin C(2) and actinomycin C(3). No myxobacteria or lytic bacteriophages with activity against either M. luteus or S. aureus were detected in either soil before or after inoculation and incubation. Although protozoa and amoebae were detected in the soils, the numbers were low and did not increase over the incubation period. These results suggest that the antibiotic activity of Jordan's red soils is due to the proliferation of antibiotic-producing bacteria.
TI  - Survival of Staphylococcus and other bacteria in skin prick test antigens solutions.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Skin prick tests are commonly used for human allergy testing and determination. Because solutions are kept at 4 degrees C and patient's skin is cleaned, the same solutions are used on many patients with the same applicators without sterilization. OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to determine whether a model bacteria could survive in antigen solutions and whether bacteria from patient's skin could be found in clinical antigen solutions. METHODS: Unused antigen solutions were spiked using Staphylococcus epidermidis. Concentration was followed from time = 0 to time = 21 days. Clinical samples consisted of antigen solutions used on a daily basis, from different hospital centers (n = 146). These were tested for total bacterial counts and detection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci. Isolates were identified by 16S rDNA sequencing. RESULTS: The concentration of S epidermidis remained stable over the 21 days. Twenty-three percent of the clinical antigen solutions contained bacteria. As expected, species like S aureus, S hominis, S epidermidis, and Micrococcus luteus were highly represented (62.5%) within a total of 20 different species. CONCLUSION: Skin bacteria can survive in antigen solutions used in skin prick tests. Moreover, even if no MRSA were observed in field samples, nosocomial infections could be a concern if pathogens were present on the skin of some tested patients.
TI  - [In vitro studies on antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of polysaccharide from Lycoris aurea].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the preliminary antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of polysaccharide extracted from Lycoris aurea. METHODS: The scavenging activities of the polysaccharide in vitro on superoxide radical (O2-*), hydroxyl radical (*OH), alkyl radical (R*) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were investigated by modified chemical systems. Meanwhile, the antimicrobial activities were tested using paper-discagar diffusion method. RESULTS: In general, the antioxidant activities of the polysaccharide were lower compared with Vc. However, the scavenging effects to *OH and H2O2 were parallel to Vc. Meanwhile, polysaccharide from Lycoris aurea had strong antimicrobial activities against Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus pumilus and Staphylococcus aureus. CONCLUSION: The polysaccharide extracted from L. aurea can scavenge *OH and H2O2 effectively and inhibit Gram-positive bacterias.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of apatite-coated titanium dioxide for textiles applications.
AB  - An antibacterial activity of apatite-coated titanium dioxide (TiO2) against four  types of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and Micrococcus luteus) was investigated. Its antibacterial performance was observed under black light, visible light, and dark conditions. The number of viable bacteria decreased with irradiation time and became most prominent at 24 hours. Distortion of bacterial cells by the nanoparticles was demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy. Apatite-coated TiO2 was fixed on cotton textiles by dip-coat technique, and the antimicrobial properties of corresponding fabrics were then investigated. The effect of irradiation source on antimicrobial activity of coated cotton fabrics was examined, wherein black-light irradiation demonstrated higher antibacterial activity than either visible-light irradiation or dark conditions. Microbial populations of coated cotton fabrics decreased with increasing irradiation intensity. Coated cotton fabrics have been shown to be nontoxic to human dermal fibroblasts. Our findings suggest that the presence of apatite-coated TiO2 shows antibacterial activity in the presence of black light or visible light, suggesting its potential use in reducing the risk of microorganism transmission for textile applications.
TI  - Transient bacteremia after removal of a bonded maxillary expansion appliance.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of transient  bacteremia after the removal of a modified bonded rapid maxillary expansion appliance. METHODS: The sample consisted of 25 subjects (15 girls, 10 boys; mean age, 14.4 years; range, 12.2-16.6 years). All subjects underwent rapid maxillary expansion at the start of the orthodontic treatment with the same type of appliance. Two 10-mL blood samples were taken, the first as a baseline and the second 3 minutes after removal of the appliance. All blood samples were incubated in an automated blood culture system, and bacteria were identified by using conventional biochemical methods and API kits (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). RESULTS: Overt soft-tissue bleeding was observed in 11 of the 25 patients during appliance removal, and 8 of 25 patients showed bacteremia after appliance removal. The data were analyzed with the Fisher exact test. No statistically significant relationship was found between overt bleeding and bacteremia incidence (P = 0.054). CONCLUSIONS: Because transient bacteremia is caused by trauma from the removal of the modified bonded rapid maxillary expansion appliance, orthodontists should consider the possibility of bacterial endocarditis in at-risk patients when using splint-type tooth-and-tissue-borne rapid maxillary expansion appliances.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of endodontic sealers based on calcium hydroxide and MTA.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of a new root canal sealer containing calcium hydroxide (Acroseal) and the root canal sealer based on MTA (Endo CPM Sealer), in comparison with traditional sealers (Sealapex, Sealer 26 and Intrafill) and white MTA-Angelus, against five different microorganism strains. The materials and their components were evaluated after manipulation, employing the agar diffusion method. A base layer was made using Muller-Hinton agar (MH) and wells were made by removing agar. The materials were placed into the wells immediately after manipulation. The microorganisms used were: Micrococcus luteus (ATCC9341), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC6538), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC27853), Candida albicans (ATCC 10231), and Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 10541). The plates were kept at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion and then incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. The results showed that Sealapex and its base paste, Sealer 26 and its powder, Endo CPM Sealer and its powder, white MTA and its powder all presented antimicrobial activity against all strains. Intrafill and its liquid presented antimicrobial activity against all strains except P. aeruginosa and Acroseal was effective only against M. luteus and S. aureus.
TI  - Binding and Cellular Activation Studies Reveal That Toll-like Receptor 2 Can Differentially Recognize Peptidoglycan from Gram-positive and Gram-negative Bacteria.
AB  - Although much progress has been made toward the identification of innate immune receptors, far less is known about how these receptors recognize specific microbial products. Such studies have been hampered by the need to purify compounds from microbial sources and a reliance on biological assays rather than direct binding to monitor recognition. We have employed surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding studies using a wide range of well defined synthetic muropeptides derived from Gram-positive (lysine-containing) and Gram-negative (diaminopimelic acid (DAP)-containing) bacteria to demonstrate that Toll-like receptor 2 can recognize peptidoglycan (PGN). In the case of lysine-containing muropeptides, a limited number of compounds, which were derived from PGN remodeled by bacterial autolysins, was recognized. However, a wider range of DAP-containing muropeptides was bound with high affinity, and these compounds were derived from nascent and remodeled PGN. The difference in recognition of the two classes of muropeptides is proposed to be a strategy by the host to respond appropriately to Gram-negative and -positive bacteria, which produce vastly different quantities of PGN. It was also found that certain modifications of the carboxylic acids of isoglutamine and DAP can dramatically reduce binding, and thus, bacterial strains may employ such modifications to evade innate immune detection. Cellular activation studies employing highly purified PGN from Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus plantarum, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus support the structure binding relationship. The data firmly establish Toll-like receptor 2 as an innate immune sensor for PGN and provides an understanding of host-pathogen interactions at the molecular level.
TI  - An investigation of bioactive phytochemicals in the leaves of Melicope vitiflora  by electrospray ionisation ion trap mass spectrometry.
AB  - The ethyl acetate extract of the leaves of Melicope vitiflora was separated by column chromatography and the resulting fractions tested for their bioactivity towards methicillin-resistant-Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Micrococcus luteus (ML). The bioactive column chromatography fractions were further separated by preparative TLC and dereplication was carried out on them by first subjecting them to electrospray ionisation-ion trap mass spectrometry (ESI-MS(n)). The resulting molecular masses, their fragmentation patterns in addition to the chemnet database (www.chemnetbase.com) were used to aid in the structural elucidation of some of the compounds by permitting comparison with known structures of natural origin. Some molecular masses and the corresponding fragmentations were found that did not correlate with any known compounds thus revealing potentially novel natural products that could be investigated on a larger scale and could ultimately find application as new drugs against MRSA and other multi drug resistant microorganisms. Structures are also proposed for known compounds that have not been previously reported for M. vitiflora.
TI  - The Triacylated ATP Binding Cluster Transporter Substrate-binding Lipoprotein of  Staphylococcus aureus Functions as a Native Ligand for Toll-like Receptor 2.
AB  - Some synthetic lipopeptides, in addition to native lipoproteins derived from both Gram-negative bacteria and mycoplasmas, are known to activate TLR2 (Toll-like receptor 2). However, the native lipoproteins inherent to Gram-positive bacteria, which function as TLR2 ligands, have not been characterized. Here, we have purified a native lipoprotein to homogeneity from Staphylococcus aureus to study as a native TLR2 ligand. The purified 33-kDa lipoprotein was capable of stimulating TLR2 and was identified as a triacylated SitC lipoprotein, which belongs to a family of ATP binding cluster (ABC) transporter substrate-binding proteins. Analyses of the SitC-mediated production of cytokine using mouse peritoneal macrophages revealed that the SitC protein (3 nm) induced the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6. Moreover, analysis of knock-out mice showed that SitC required TLR2 and MyD88, but not TLR1 or TLR6, for the induction of cytokines. In addition to the S. aureus SitC lipoprotein, we purified two other native ABC transporter substrate-binding lipoproteins from Bacillus subtilis and Micrococcus luteus, which were both shown to stimulate TLR2. These results demonstrate that S. aureus SitC lipoprotein is triacylated and that the ABC transporter substrate-binding lipoproteins of Gram-positive bacteria function as native ligands for TLR2.
TI  - Oxidation of lanthionines renders the lantibiotic nisin inactive.
AB  - The peptide antibiotic nisin A belongs to the group of antibiotics called lantibiotics. They are classified as lantibiotics because they contain the structural group lanthionine. Lanthionines are composed of a single sulfur atom that is linked to the beta-carbons of two alanine moieties. These sulfur atoms are vulnerable to environmental oxidation. A mild oxidation reaction was performed on nisin A to determine the relative effects it would have on bioactivity. High-mass-accuracy Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry data revealed the addition of seven, eight, and nine oxygens. These additions correspond to the five lanthionines, two methionines, and two histidines that would be susceptible to oxidation. Subsequent bioassays revealed that the oxidized form of nisin A had a complete loss of bactericidal activity. In a competition study, the oxidized nisin did not appear to have an antagonistic affect on the bioactivity of nisin A, since the addition of an equal molar concentration of the oxidized variant did not have an influence on the bactericidal activity of the native antibiotic. Electron microscopy data revealed that the oxidized forms were still capable of assembling into large circular complexes, demonstrating that oxidation does not disrupt the lateral assembly mechanism of the antibiotic. Affinity thin-layer chromatography and fluorescence microscopy experiments suggested that the loss of activity is due to the inability of the oxidized form of nisin to bind to the cell wall precursor lipid II. Given the loss of bioactivity following oxidation, oxidation should be an important factor to consider in future production, purification, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic studies.
TI  - Compound-specific nitrogen isotope analysis of D-alanine, L-alanine, and valine:  application of diastereomer separation to delta15N and microbial peptidoglycan studies.
AB  - We have developed an analytical method to determine the compound-specific nitrogen isotope compositions of individual amino acid enantiomers using gas chromatography/combustion/isotope ratio mass spectrometry. A novel derivatization of amino acid diastereomers by optically active (R)-(-)-2-butanol or (S)-(+)-2-butanol offers two advantages for nitrogen isotope analysis. First, chromatographic chiral separation can be achieved without the use of chiral stationary-phase columns. Second, the elution order of these compounds on the chromatogram can be switched by a designated esterification reaction. We applied the method to the compound-specific nitrogen isotope analysis of D- and L-alanine in a peptidoglycan derived from the cell walls of cultured bacteria (Firmicutes and Actinobacteria; Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus staphylolyticus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, and Streptomyces sp.), natural whole bacterial cells (Bacillus subtilis var. natto), (pseudo)-peptidoglycan from archaea (Methanobacterium sp.), and cell wall from eukaryota (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). We observed statistically significant differences in nitrogen isotopic compositions; e.g., delta15N ( per thousand vs air) in Staphylococcus staphylolyticus for d-alanine (19.2 +/- 0.5 per thousand, n = 4) and L-alanine (21.3 +/- 0.8 per thousand, n = 4) and in Bacillus subtilis for D-alanine (6.2 +/- 0.2 per thousand, n = 3) and L-alanine (8.2 +/- 0.4 per thousand, n = 3). These results suggest that enzymatic reaction pathways, including the alanine racemase reaction, produce a nitrogen isotopic difference in amino acid enantiomers, resulting in 15N-depleted D-alanine. This method is expected to facilitate compound-specific nitrogen isotope studies of amino acid stereoisomers.
TI  - Antimicrobial and antifungal activities of the extracts and essential oils of Bidens tripartita.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the antibacterial and antifungal properties of the extracts, subextracts and essential oils of Bidens tripartita flowers and herbs. In the study, twelve extracts and two essential oils were investigated for activity against different Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, E. coli (beta-laktamase+), Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL+), Pseudomonas aeruginosa and some fungal organisms Candida albicans, C. parapsilosis, Aspergillus fumigatus, A. terreus using a broth microdilution and disc diffusion methods. The results obtained indicate antimicrobial activity of the tested extracts (except butanolic extracts), which however did not inhibit the growth of fungi used in this study. Bacteriostatic effect of both essential oils is insignificant, but they have strong antifungal activity. These results support the use of B. tripartita to treat a microbial infections and it is indicated as an antimicrobial and antifungal agent, which may act as pharmaceuticals and preservatives.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of iodoquinol 1%-hydrocortisone acetate 2% gel against ciclopirox and clotrimazole.
AB  - Commercially available topical formulations consisting of iodoquinol 1%-hydrocortisone acetate 2%, ciclopirox 0.77%, and clotrimazole 1%-betamethasone dipropionate 0.5% were assessed for their antimicrobial activity against cultures of Micrococcus luteus, Propionibacterium acnes, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Corynebacterium aquaticum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Malassezia furfur, Microsporum canis, Candida albicans, Trichophyton rubrum, or Epidermophyton floccosum. At 1 and 5 minutes following inoculation into suspensions of each product, aliquots were removed, serially diluted, and plated onto appropriate agar to determine the log reduction in colony-forming units (CFUs) for each organism. Iodoquinol 1% produced the broadest and greatest antimicrobial activity as measured by a 3-log reduction of CFU, active against all microbes tested following incubation times of 1 or 5 minutes, except M luteus. By contrast, ciclopirox 0.77% and clotrimazole 1% showed activity against P aeruginosa and T rubrum, with ciclopirox also killing M luteus, P acnes, M canis, C albicans, and E floccosum at 5 minutes. Iodoquinol 1%-hydrocortisone acetate 2% also was the only product that showed effective antibacterial reduction of MRSA at 1 minute.
TI  - Pitfalls in efficacy testing--how important is the validation of neutralization of chlorhexidine digluconate?
AB  - BACKGROUND: Effective neutralization of active agents is essential to obtain valid efficacy results, especially when non-volatile active agents like chlorhexidine digluconate (CHG) are tested. The aim of this study was to determine an effective and non-toxic neutralizing mixture for a propan-1-ol solution containing 2% CHG. METHODS: Experiments were carried out according to ASTM E 1054-02. The neutralization capacity was tested separately with five challenge microorganisms in suspension, and with a rayon swab carrier. Either 0.5 mL of the antiseptic solution (suspension test) or a saturated swab with the antiseptic solution (carrier test) was added to tryptic soy broth containing neutralizing agents. After the samples were mixed, aliquots were spread immediately and after 3 h of storage at 2 - 8 degrees C onto tryptic soy agar containing a neutralizing mixture. RESULTS: The neutralizer was, however, not consistently effective in the suspension test. Immediate spread yielded a valid neutralization with Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Corynebacterium jeikeium but not with Micrococcus luteus (p < 0.001) and Candida albicans (p < 0.001). A 3-h storage period of the neutralized active agents in suspension resulted in significant carry-over activity of CHG in addition against Staphylococcus epidermidis (p < 0.001) and Corynebacterium jeikeium (p = 0.044). In the carrier test, the neutralizing mixture was found to be effective and non toxic to all challenge microorganisms when spread immediately. However, after 3 h storage of the neutralized active agents significant carry-over activity of CHG against Micrococcus luteus (p = 0.004; Tukey HSD) was observed. CONCLUSION: Without effective neutralization in the sampling fluid, non-volatile active ingredients will continue to reduce the number of surviving microorganisms after antiseptic treatment even if the sampling fluid is kept cold straight after testing. This can result in false-positive antiseptic efficacy data. Attention should be paid during the neutralization validation process to the amount of antiseptic solution, the storage time and to the choice of appropriate and sensitive microorganisms.
TI  - Development of a simple and low cost microbioreactor for high-throughput bioprocessing.
AB  - A simple microbioreactor for high-throughput bioprocessing made from low cost polymer polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tubes with a working volume of 1.5 ml is described. We have developed a microfluidic system that handles a small population of cells of a model microorganism, Pseudomonas aeruginosa DS10-129. Under the conditions of the microbioreactor, the organism produced extracellular secondary metabolites by using nutrient broth modified with glycerol. Pyocyanins were isolated from the fermented medium as a metabolite of interest. Antibiotic properties of pyocyanin were effective against a number of microorganisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermis, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Batch fermentation of the model organism in the microbioreactor was compared to shake-flask and conventional bench fermenter methods. Results obtained from the microbioreactor compared favourably with the conventional processes.
TI  - Growth, encystment and survival of Acanthamoeba castellanii grazing on different  bacteria.
AB  - Free-living amoebae of the genus Acanthamoeba are widely distributed in soil and  water collections, where trophozoites (vegetative, multiplicative stages) feed mainly by phagocytosis and thus control bacterial populations in the environment. Here, we examined the growth, encystment and survival of Acanthamoeba castellanii receiving different bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus) in nonnutrient saline. All bacteria assayed induced a dose-dependent proliferative response, in most cases maximized with a bacterial dose of 1 x 10(9) mL(-1); except for M. luteus, trophozoites grew better with viable than with heat-killed bacteria. In addition, Acanthamoeba growth was improved by adding bacteria on alternate days. Single-dose experiments indicated a temporal association between the growth of trophozoite and bacterial consumption, and higher consumption of M. luteus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa, bacterial species that allowed the highest trophozoite yields. Long-term Acanthamoeba-bacteria incubation revealed that encystment was significantly delayed by almost all the bacteria assayed (including S. aureus, which elicited a poor growth response) and that the presence of bacteria markedly increased cyst yield; final cyst recovery clearly depended on both the dose and the type of the bacterium given, being much higher with E. coli, M. luteus and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Wound healing, anti-microbial and antioxidant potential of Dendrophthoe falcata (L.f) Ettingsh.
AB  - Dendrophthoe falcata (L.f) Ettingsh (Loranthaceae) of the order Santalales, is used ethnomedicinally for treating ulcers, asthma, impotence, paralysis, skin diseases, and wounds. In this context, validations of the ethnotherapeutic claims of the plant in wound healing activity was studied, besides anti-microbial activity and antioxidant activity were performed to understand the mechanism of wound healing potency. The ethanolic extract of aerial parts of Dendrophthoe falcata ethanolic extract (DFEE) was investigated for the evaluation of its healing efficiency on excision and incision wound models in rats. The results showed that Dendrophthoe falcata extract has potent wound healing capacity as evident from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. Hydroxyproline and hexosamine expressions were also well correlative with the healing pattern observed. Three of the fractions A-C (petroleum ether, chloroform and ethanol, respectively) obtained from the extract exhibited significant antimicrobial activity against the organisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Serratia marcescens, and five fungi Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis: dimorphic fungi, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger: systemic fungi, and some infectious bacteria Escherichia coli, and Salmonella typhi. The results also indicated that DFEE possesses potent antioxidant activity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation, reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase levels and increased the catalase activity.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and antimicrobial activity of Co(II), Zn(II) and Cd(II) complexes with N-benzyloxycarbonyl-S-phenylalanine.
AB  - In this paper the first complexes of M(2+) ions (M(2+) = Zn(2+), Cd(2+) and Co(2+)) with N-benzyloxycarbonyl-S-phenylalaninato ligand (1-3) are described. The new complexes were characterized by means of elemental analysis, IR and UV-vis spectroscopy, molar conductivity measurements and (1)H, (13)C and (15)N NMR spectroscopy (1D and 2D). The Co(II) complex adopts an octahedral geometry, and the Zn(II) and Cd(II) complexes adopt a tetrahedral one. For the first time, the antimicrobial activity of N-benzyloxycarbonyl-S-phenylalaninato ligand (N-Boc-S-phe) and the complexes 1-3 was investigated against gram-positive: Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and Bacillus subtilis and gram-negative bacteria: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and two strains of the yeast Candida albicans. It was shown that the complexes were effective against most strains. The best activity was detected against the yeast C. albicans.
TI  - Bacterial regulation of antagonistic activity of bacteria.
AB  - The phenomenon of microbial regulation of bacterial antagonism was studied using  metabolites and cell walls of indicator microorganism culture as inductors. The algorithm of selection of stimulators of bacterial antagonistic activity is determined, experimental conditions are described, and methodological approach to stimulation of bacterial antagonistic activity is developed, which can be used for stimulation of probiotic antagonistic activity and for improving colonization resistance of the host organism during infection.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activities of the essential oil from the seeds of Enterolobium contortisiliquum (leguminosae).
AB  - Seeds of Enterolobium contortisiliquum were subjected to steam distillation to obtain a light yellow essential oil in a yield of 3 ml/kg of seeds. The major components of the oil were identified using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and were furfural, limonene, linalool, estragole, carvone, and apiole with carvone representing more than 50% of the total composition. Antimicrobial activities of the essential oil were determined against four species of gram positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus) and two gram negative bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia Marcescencs). The essential oil inhibited the growth of all tested bacteria but was most effective against the gram positive bacteria. Chemicals that are responsible for the antibacterial effect of the essential oil were determined using the bio-autography thin layer chromatography (TLC) technique. The active compounds responsible for the activity were found to be carvone and estragole.
TI  - Mitracarpus frigidus aerial parts exhibited potent antimicrobial, antileishmanial, and antioxidant effects.
AB  - The crude extract and the hexane, CH(2)Cl(2), EtOAc, n-BuOH, and hydromethanolic  fractions of the aerial parts of Mitracarpus frigidus were evaluated against promastigote forms of two species of Leishmania (L. chagasi and L. amazonensis), 11 strains of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica sorovar Tythimurium, Shigella sonnei, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Bacillus cereus) and two yeasts (Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans). The antioxidant activity (DPPH radical scavenging activity and reducing power), cytotoxicity against mammalian cells, and the contents of phenolics and flavonoids were determined. Phytochemical analysis of the major groups of phytoconstituents is also reported. All samples showed antioxidant activity which was positively correlated to the content of phenolic compounds. S. sonnei, B. cereus and C. neoformans were susceptible to all extracts tested, except for the n-BuOH and hydromethanolic fractions, which demonstrated no antimicrobial activity. The lowest MIC was recorded for the CH(2)Cl(2) fraction against C. neoformans (MIC of 10 microg/ml), followed by B. cereus, S. sonnei, and E. cloacae (MIC of 20, 39 and 39 microg/ml, respectively). The CH(2)Cl(2) fraction was the most effective against L. chagasi (IC(50) of 6.7 microg/ml), and the hydromethanolic fraction exhibited the best activity against L. amazonensis (IC(50) of 9 microg/ml). A cytotoxic effect on mammalian cells was observed only for the crude extract and CH(2)Cl(2) fraction at the concentrations of 130 and 31 microg/ml, respectively. These results suggest that M. frigidus has interesting antimicrobial, antileishmanial and antioxidant activities.
TI  - Ceragenins: cholic acid-based mimics of antimicrobial peptides.
AB  - The prevalence of drug-resistant bacteria drives the quest for new antimicrobials, including those that are not expected to readily engender resistance. One option is to mimic Nature's most ubiquitous means of controlling bacterial growth, antimicrobial peptides, which have evolved over eons. In general, bacteria remain susceptible to these peptides. Human antimicrobial peptides play a central role in innate immunity, and deficiencies in these peptides have been tied to increased rates of infection. However, clinical use of antimicrobial peptides is hampered by issues of cost and stability. The development of nonpeptide mimics of antimicrobial peptides may provide the best of both worlds: a means of using the same mechanism chosen by Nature to control bacterial growth without the problems associated with peptide therapeutics. The ceragenins were developed to mimic the cationic, facially amphiphilic structures of most antimicrobial peptides. These compounds reproduce the required morphology using a bile-acid scaffolding and appended amine groups. The resulting compounds are actively bactericidal against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, including drug-resistant bacteria. This antimicrobial activity originates from selective association of the ceragenins with negatively charged bacterial membrane components. Association has been studied with synthetic models of bacterial membrane components, with bacterial lipopolysaccharide, with vesicles derived from bacterial phospholipids, and with whole cells. Comparisons of the antimicrobial activities of ceragenins and representative antimicrobial peptides suggest that these classes of compounds share a mechanism of action. Rapid membrane depolarization is caused by both classes as well as blebbing of bacterial membranes. Bacteria express the same genes in response to both classes of compounds. On the basis of the antibacterial activities of ceragenins and preliminary in vivo studies, we expect these compounds to find use in augmenting or replacing antimicrobial peptides in treating human disease.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Thymus daenensis methanolic extract.
AB  - Medicinal plants are potential of antimicrobial compounds. The present study deals with the antibacterial activity of methanolic extract of Thymus daenensis. Aerial parts of the plant were collected from Alvand mountainside (Hamadan, Iran) in May 2005, air-dried and extracted by methanol. The dried extract was redissolved in methanol to make a 100 mg/ml solution and then filtered. Antibacterial activity of the extract was evaluated against various Gram-positive and Gram-negatives bacteria using disk diffusion technique. Blank paper disks were loaded with 40 microl of the methanol solution and then dried up. The impregnated disks were placed on Mueller-Hinton agar inoculated with bacterial suspension equal to 0.5 McFarland. The extract inhibited the growth Gram-positive bacteria, i.e., Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Entrococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, but it showed no activity against Gram-negative bacteria. The most significant effect was seen against S.aureus including MRSA, which are important nosocomial pathogens. MIC90 of the extract was determined against Gram-positive bacteria (3.12 mg/ml) and 11 MRSA strain (1.56 mg/ml).
TI  - Synthesis and anti-microbial screening of some Schiff bases of 3-amino-6,8-dibromo-2-phenylquinazolin-4(3H)-ones.
AB  - In the present study, a series of novel Schiff bases were synthesized by condensation of 3-amino-6,8-dibromo-2-phenylquinazolin-4(3H)-ones with different aromatic aldehydes via cyclized intermediate 6,8-dibromo-2-phenyl benzoxazin-4-one. The chemical structures were confirmed by means of IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, Mass spectral and Elemental analysis. These compounds were screened for anti-bacterial (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC-9144, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC-155, Micrococcus luteus ATCC-4698, Bacillus cereus ATCC-11778, Escherichia coli ATCC-25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC-2853, and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC-11298) and anti-fungal (Aspergillus niger ATCC-9029 and Aspergillus fumigatus ATCC-46645) activities by paper disc diffusion technique. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the compounds were also determined by agar streak dilution method. Among the synthesized compounds 3-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzylideneamino)-6,8-dibromo-2-phenylquinazolin-4(3H)-one 10 was found to be the most potent anti-microbial activity with MICs of 18.9, 19.1, 18.8, 21.7, 18.2, 19.3, 16.7, 8.6 and 10.1 microg/ml against above mentioned respective strains. Compounds were found to exhibit more anti-fungal than anti-bacterial activity.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of labdane diterpenoids from Stemodia foliosa.
AB  - As part of a continuing interest in exploring the chemistry of Brazilian medicinal plants, three new labdane diterpenoids, 6alpha-acetoxymanoyl oxide (1), 6alpha-malonyloxymanoyl oxide (2), and 6alpha-malonyloxy-n-butyl ester manoyl oxide (3), together with the known betulinic acid, lupeol, sitosterol, and stigmasterol, were isolated from the aerial parts of Stemodia foliosa. The structures of 1-3 were established on the basis of interpretation of spectroscopic data, including HRESIMS, and 1D and 2D NMR techniques. All compounds were tested against a bacteria panel consisting of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis, B. anthracis, Micrococcus luteus, Mycobacterium smegmatis, and M. phlei. Compound 2 showed moderate activity against these strains, with MIC values in the range 7-20 microg/mL.
TI  - Antimicrobial protein from Streptomyces fulvissimus inhibitory to methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Fermented culture of Streptomyces fulvissimus was found to secrete an antibacterial protein inhibitory to Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains. The extracellular protein from the fermented culture on concentration revealed a high molecular weight peptide of 63kDa on SDS-PAGE gel and the region on gel displayed inhibitory activity against methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Bioactivity of the extra cellular protein was non-sensitive to proteinase K, alpha chymotrypsin, protease, EDTA (ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid), PMSF (phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride) and DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) but partially susceptible to amylase and heat. Glycoprotein nature of the proteinaceous compound was confirmed by periodic acid schiffs (PAS) staining. The secretary protein of S. fulvissimus demonstrated a significant activity against MRSA strain. It could be an important source for developing new drugs to control multidrug resistant gram positive bacteria.
TI  - [Study of ectoparasitism of ultramicrobacteria of the genus Kaistia, strains NF1  and NF3 by electron and fluorescence microscopy].
AB  - Transmission electron and fluorescence microscopy was used to study the character of the interaction of free-living ultramicrobacterial (UMB) strains NF1 and NF3, affiliated with the genus Kaistia, and seven species of gram-positive and gram-negative heterotrophic bacteria. Strains NF1 and NF3 were found to exhibit parasitic activity against gram-positive Bacillus subtilis and gram-negative Acidovorax delafildii. UMB cells are tightly attached to the envelopes of the victim cells and induce their lysis, thus demonstrating the features of typical ectoparasitism. The selectivity of parasitism of the studied UMB to the victim bacteria has been shown: only two soil microorganisms of the seven test objects, B. subtilis ATCC 6633 and an aerobic gram-negative bacterium A. delafildii 39, were found to be sensitive to UMB attack. Other bacteria (Micrococcus luteus VKM Ac-2230, Staphylococcus aureus 209-P, Pseudomonas putida BS394, Escherichia coli C 600, and Pantoea agglomerans ATCC 27155) were not attacked by UMB. It was established for the first time that free-living UMB may be facultative parasites not only of phototrophic bacteria, as we have previously demonstrated, but of heterotrophic bacteria as well. The UMB under study seem to play an important role in the regulation of the quantity of microorganisms and in the functioning of microbial communities in some natural ecotopes.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Miconia species (Melastomataceae).
AB  - This work evaluated the antimicrobial activity of the methanol and chloroform extracts of the leaves of Miconia cabucu, Miconia rubiginosa, and Miconia stenostachya using the disc-diffusion method. The results obtained showed that the methanol extracts of the leaves of M. rubiginosa and M. stenostachya and the chloroform extract of the leaves of M. cabucu presented antimicrobial activity against the tested microorganisms.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of dextran-conjugated lysozyme against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus in cheese curd.
AB  - The purposes of this research were to glycosylate lysozyme with dextran under Maillard reaction conditions and assess the antimicrobial characteristics of the lysozyme-dextran conjugate in a culture medium and cheese curd. Solutions containing lysozyme and dextran were incubated at 60 degrees C and at 79% relative humidity. Gel permeation chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were used to follow the glycosylation process. Under optimum conditions 3.7 mol of dextran were coupled to 1 mol of lysozyme. Lytic activity of the conjugate against the cell wall of Micrococcus luteus was about 62% of that of native lysozyme. Evaluation of the lysozyme-dextran conjugate against test microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli) in culture media indicated a progressive increase in antimicrobial activity, with an increase in enzyme-conjugate concentration. The lysozyme-dextran conjugate was also effective against E. coli in a natural food system, as it reduced the bacterial count by 3 log in cheese curd after 40 days of storage. Unlike E. coli, the antimicrobial action of lysozyme against S. aureus was not improved by conjugation with dextran in both in vitro and in vivo tests. Antimicrobial activity of the lysozyme-dextran conjugate against gram-negative bacteria is probably related to the remaining lytic activity as well as the excellent surfactant properties of the lysozyme-dextran conjugate. These results might increase the applicability of lysozyme as a natural antimicrobial ingredient in different food products.
TI  - Synthesis, structure and biological activities of cobalt(II) and zinc(II) coordination compounds with 2-benzimidazole derivatives.
AB  - In this work we present the synthesis, structural and spectroscopic characterisation of a series of cobalt(II) and zinc(II) coordination compounds with benzimidazole (bz) and its 2-benzimidazole derivatives: 2-aminobenzimidazole (2ab), albendazole (abz) and tris(2-benzimidazolylmethyl)amine (ntb). The compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Proteus vulgaris. Their cytotoxic activity was also evaluated using human cancer lines, HeLa, HCT-15 and SKLU-1. The halide tetrahedral compounds [Co(bz)2Br2] 3, [Zn(2ab)2Cl2].0.5H2O 11, [Co(abz)Cl2(H2O)].3H2O 14, [Co(abz)Br2(H2O)] 15, [Zn(abz)Cl2(H2O)].3H2O 17 and [Zn(abz)Br2(H2O)].H2O 18 displayed similar minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) values against Micrococcus luteus and Escherichia coli, comparable to those of amoxicillin and chloramphenicol. Additionally, 11 showed a wide range of activity towards Gram(+) and Gram(-) microorganisms. The tetradentate ntb and its trigonal bipyramidal cobalt(II) and zinc(II) compounds were active, regardless of the anion present in the complex. Compound [Co(abz)Cl2(H2O)].3H2O 14 showed promising activity in HeLa cells, while [Co(ntb)Br]Br.H2O 21 inhibited Hela and HCT-15 cell lines.
TI  - Characterization of Antarctic psychrotrophic bacteria with antibacterial activities against terrestrial microorganisms.
AB  - Five-hundreds and eighty bacterial strains, isolated from various Antarctic marine sources and locations, were screened for antimicrobial activity against terrestrial microorganisms. Twenty-two Antarctic isolates (3.8%), mainly retrieved from the water column at Terra Nova Bay (Ross Sea), expressed antagonistic activity against one to three indicator organisms. Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis resulted as the more susceptible, followed by Micrococcus luteus and Bacillus subtilis. None of the isolates inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica and the eukaryotic fungus Candida albicans. Active Antarctic isolates, identified by 16S rDNA sequencing and phenotypically characterized by classical methods, were phylogenetically affiliated to the Actinobacteria (16 strains) and the gamma-Proteobacteria (6 strains). Inhibition patterns, as well as phenotypic characteristics, highly vary for different isolates, even though they were affiliated to the same genus or closely related to the identical microorganism retrieved from the database, suggesting that these features were more likely strain-rather than species-specific.Results obtained from the present study confirm previous observations and highlight the potentiality of Antarctic marine bacteria as novel source of antibacterial substances.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of the bromophenols from the red alga Odonthalia corymbifera and some synthetic derivatives.
AB  - A series of bromophenols was obtained by isolation from red alga Odonthalia corymbifera and by reactions of bis(hydroxyphenyl)methanes with bromine. New bromophenols including 3,3',5,5'-tetrabromo-2,2',4,4'-tetrahydroxydiphenylmethane (10), a regioisomer of the potent antimicrobial natural product, together with known derivatives were synthesized in high yield. All of the isolated and synthesized compounds were tested for antimicrobial activity against gram-negative, gram-positive bacteria and fungi. The preliminary structure-activity relationship, to elucidate the essential structure requirements for antimicrobial activity, has been described. Among the isolated natural products 2,2',3,3'-tetrabromo-4,4',5,5'-tetrahydroxydiphenylmethane (4) was found to be the most active derivative against Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Trichophyton rubrum, and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. The synthetic bromophenols 3,3'-dibromo-6,6'-dihydroxydiphenylmethane (13) and 3,3',5,5'-tetrabromo-6,6'-dihydroxydiphenylmethane (14) showed potent antibacterial effect against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Proteus vulgaris, and Salmonella typhimurium.
TI  - Bioprospecting highly diverse endophytic Pestalotiopsis spp. with antibacterial properties from Maytenus ilicifolia, a medicinal plant from Brazil.
AB  - Thirteen endophytic fungal strains of the genus Pestalotiopsis were isolated from the medicinal plant Maytenus ilicifolia Mart. ex. Reiss (commonly known as "espinheira santa") and their antimicrobial properties were investigated. Two isolates were successful in inhibiting the growth of the tested microorganisms (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)) using the technique of bioautographic thin-layer chromatography (TLC) agar overlay assay. An analysis based on a polyphasic approach integrating taxonomic information, morphological traits, RAPD markers, and the sequencing of the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 of the rDNA led to the assignment of the isolates as belonging to the species Pestalotiopsis microspora, Pestalotiopsis vismiae, and Pestalotiopsis leucothoes. Therefore, the present study presents a new approach to the study of endophytic fungi of the genus Pestalotiopsis.
TI  - Characterization of mucosal biofilms on human adenoid tissues.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate the presence of mucosal biofilm in adenoid tissue using double staining for visualization of both the bacterial matrix and the bacterial cells. To identify bacterial species present on the surface of the studied adenoids. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study. METHODS: A total of 39 specimens of adenoidectomy were removed from children with chronic and/or recurrent otitis media. The specimens were prepared for light microscopy using Gram staining, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Double staining was performed with CLSM to visualize both the bacteria and the glycocalyx matrix. Nine adenoids on which bacterial biofilms were visualized with CLSM were used for identification of bacterial species by 16S-DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and homology analysis. RESULTS: Of the 39 adenoids investigated, 22 (54%) showed evidence of mucosal biofilms. Gram staining, SEM and CLSM showed the presence of bacterial cells, organized in bacterial microcolonies. CLSM with double staining demonstrated mucosal biofilms by showing the presence of both bacteria and the glycocalyx. The use of 16S-DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and subsequent sequence analyses identified the presence of Corynebacterium argentoratense, Streptococcus salivarius, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that adenoid tissue in children with chronic or/and recurrent otitis media contains mucosal biofilms in 54% of the cases. The existence of living bacteria has been demonstrated. Further studies are required to describe the panel of bacteria that can be harbored in the biofilms present in adenoids and the mechanisms involved in the physiopathology of otitis prone children.
TI  - Bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances from Campylobacter spp.
AB  - Twenty-five Campylobacter isolates were screened for production of antimicrobial  substances using a deferred antagonism assay. Sixteen isolates showed activity against either Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis or Candida albicans. The inhibitory activity was sensitive to treatment with pronase E, trypsin and pepsin, suggesting that the antimicrobial compound(s) are proteinaceous. Activity spectra of isolates included S. aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Streptococcus sp., Bacillus subtilis, a drug-resistant clinical isolate of S. aureus and one isolate of C. albicans. Producing isolates showed cross-immunity and inhibitory activity was only observed on solid media. The findings of this study suggest that Campylobacter produces proteinaceous inhibitory substances.
TI  - Broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity of the reactive compounds generated in vitro by Manduca sexta phenoloxidase.
AB  - Although quinone production and melanin formation are widely recognized as an integral part of the insect defense system, experimental evidence is lacking that the proteolytic activation of prophenoloxidase participates in the direct killing of invading microbes-active phenoloxidase generates quinones that polymerize to form melanin. Here, we report the antimicrobial effect of reactive intermediates produced in phenoloxidase-catalyzed reactions. After being treated with Manduca sexta phenoloxidase and dopamine, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis ceased to grow, whereas the growth of Pichia pastoris was slightly affected. Microscopic analysis showed melanin deposition on cell surface, aggregation of bacteria, and loss of cell mobility. Viability tests revealed major decreases in the bacterial colony counts and, since the decrease remained significant after dispersion of the cell clumps, the reactive compounds were surmised to have aggregated and killed E. coli and B. subtilis cells. Under the experimental conditions, 60-94% of the Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium) and 52-99% of the Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus) were killed. In the presence of phenoloxidase, dopamine or 5,6-dihydroxyindole (DHI) exhibited much higher antibacterial activity than L-dopa, N-acetyldopamine (NADA) or N-beta-alanyldopamine (NBAD) did, suggesting that DHI and its oxidation products were cytotoxic. The antifungal activity of DHI was detected using P. pastoris, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida albicans, and Beauveria bassiana. These results established that prophenoloxidase activation is an integral component of the insect defense system involving a multitude of enzymes (e.g. proteinases, oxidases, and dopachrome conversion enzyme (DCE)), which immobilizes and kills invading microorganisms.
TI  - A combined mass spectrometric and cDNA sequencing approach to the isolation and characterization of novel antimicrobial peptides from the skin secretions of Phyllomedusa hypochondrialis azurea.
AB  - Studies conducted on amphibian skin secretions over the past 40 years have isolated and identified huge arrays of bioactive peptides, many of which have demonstrated potent anti-microbial activity. Such peptides are attracting increasing attention due to the growing problem of pathogenic microorganisms resistant to conventional antibiotics. The current study utilized a combined proteomic/genomic approach to facilitate the high throughput sequencing of five novel dermaseptins and four novel phylloseptins from the skin secretions of Phyllomedusa hypochondrialis azurea. Peptides were partially identified using Q-TOF MS/MS fragmentation and de novo sequencing, while a cDNA library was constructed from the lyophilized skin secretion. 3'-RACE reactions used primers designed for the highly conserved 5'-signal regions of previously deduced dermaseptin precursors. cDNA sequenced peptides were attributed to their respective fragmentation spectra to confirm the structure of the final processed peptides. Such an approach identified post-translational modifications in addition to deciphering isobaric amino acids. Several of the peptides were purified to homogeneity and displayed potent antimicrobial activity with minimum inhibitory concentrations starting at 0.4 microM when tested against and range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria including Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus.
TI  - Comparison of the antibacterial activity of honey from different provenance against bacteria usually isolated from skin wounds.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of honey samples provided by apiarists and honey packers was tested against microorganisms usually isolated from skin wounds. The antibacterial activity was tested using the well-agar diffusion assay. The honey samples were tested without dilution, and at 75, 50, 30, and 10% (w/v) dilution. Most of the undiluted honey samples inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Some honey samples provided by apiarists also inhibited the growth of S. aureus even at 50% dilution. Undiluted honey samples also inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus uberis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, although to a lesser extent. No inhibition of Micrococcus luteus and Enterococcus faecalis growth was detected. The diameters of the inhibition zones generated by honey samples provided by apiarists were larger than those generated by honey samples provided by honey packers. This observation may be explained by considering the provenance of the honey samples.
TI  - New triazole and triazolothiadiazine derivatives as possible antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Triazole and triazoles fused with six-membered ring systems are found to possess  diverse applications in the fields of medicine, agriculture and industry. The new 1,2,4-triazole and 1,2,4-triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazine derivatives were synthesized as novel antimicrobial agents. The reaction of 1H-indol-3-acetic acid with thiocarbohydrazide gave the 4-amino-3-mercapto-5-[(1H-indol-3-yl)methyl]-4H-1,2,4-triazole. The reaction of triazole with arylaldehydes in ethanol gave the 4-arylideneamino-3-mercapto-5-[(1H-indol-3-yl)methyl]-4H-1,2,4-triazoles (I). The 3-[(1H-indol-3-yl)methyl]-6-aryl-7H-1,2,4-triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazines (II) were obtained by condensing triazole with phenacyl bromides in absolute ethanol . The chemical structures of the compounds were elucidated by IR, (1)H NMR and FAB(+)-MS spectral data. Their antimicrobial activities against Micrococcus luteus (NRLL B-4375), Bacillus cereus (NRRL B-3711), Proteus vulgaris (NRRL B-123), Salmonella typhimurium (NRRL B-4420), Staphylococcus aureus (NRRL B-767), Escherichia coli (NRRL B-3704), Candida albicans and Candida glabrata (isolates obtained from Osmangazi University, Faculty of Medicine) were investigated and significant activity was obtained.
TI  - Synthesis of isomeric, oxathiolone fused chalcones, and comparison of their activity toward various microorganisms and human cancer cells line.
AB  - Isomeric oxathiolone fused chalcones were prepared by condensation of appropriate acetylbenzo[1,3]oxathiol-2-ones with benzaldehydes under acidic conditions. The synthesized compounds were screened for cytotoxic activity using HeLa cells, as well as for antibacterial activity against Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, antifungal activity against Candida albicans, and tuberculostatic activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H(37)Rv and Mycobacterium kansasii strains.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of endodontic sealers, MTA-based cements and Portland cement.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of different root-end filling materials - Sealer 26, Sealapex with zinc oxide, zinc oxide and eugenol, white and gray Portland cement, white and gray MTA-Angelus, and gray Pro Root MTA - against six different microorganism strains. The agar diffusion method was used. A base layer was made using Muller-Hinton agar (MH) and wells were formed by removing the agar. The materials were placed in the wells immediately after manipulation. The microorganisms used were: Micrococcus luteus (ATCC9341), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC6538), Escherichia coli (ATCC10538), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC27853), Candida albicans (ATCC 10231), and Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 10541). The plates were kept at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion and then incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. Triphenyltetrazolium chloride 0.05% gel was added for optimization, and the zones of inhibition were measured. Data were subjected to the Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn tests at a 5% significance level. The results showed that all materials had antimicrobial activity against all the tested strains. Analysis of the efficacy of the materials against the microbial strains showed that Sealapex with zinc oxide, zinc oxide and eugenol and Sealer 26 created larger inhibition halos than the MTA-based and Portland cements (P < 0.05). On the basis of the methodology used, it may be concluded that all endodontic sealers, MTA-based and Portland cements evaluated in this study possess antimicrobial activity, particularly the endodontic sealers.
TI  - Microbiologic profile of flexible endoscope disinfection in two Brazilian hospitals.
AB  - BACKGROUND: [corrected] Endoscopes are routinely used in hospitals and clinics of the world and they can be potential sources of cross-infection when the decontamination process is unsuitable AIM: The routines of flexible endoscope (bronchoscopes, esophagogastroduodenoscopes and colonoscopes) disinfection procedures used in two Brazilian university hospitals were evaluated during a 3-year period METHODS: Aleatory samples from internal channels of endoscopes were collected after patient examination and after cleaning/disinfection procedures RESULTS: A contamination >3 log10 was achieved in samples recovered from endoscopes after patient examination. These samples yielded gram-negative bacilli (n = 142: 56%), gram-positive cocci (n = 43: 17%), yeast cells (n = 43: 17%), and gram-positive bacilli (n = 26: 10%). Approximately, 72 out of 149 samples (48.32%) collected after undergoing the cleaning and disinfection procedures disclosed gram-negative bacilli (n = 55: 61%), gram-positive cocci (n = 21: 23%), gram-positive bacilli (n = 8: 9%) and yeast cells (n = 6: 7%). Esophagogastroduodenoscopes and colonoscopes were the most frequently contaminated devices. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter freundii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus coagulase negative, Micrococcus luteus, Candida albicans, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, C. guilliermondii, Bacillus spp and Corynebacterium spp were predominantly identified CONCLUSION: Inappropriate cleaning and low times of disinfection were respectively the major factors associated with the presence of microorganisms in colonoscopes and esophagogastroduodenoscopes. By analyzing the identified germs, hospital disinfection was considered of either intermediate or poor level. After this investigation, both university centers improved their previous protocols for disinfection and conditions for reprocessing endoscopes.
TI  - A new antibacterial compound produced by an indigenous marine bacteria--fermentation, isolation, and biological activity.
AB  - The use of microorganisms for biological purpose has become an effective alternative to control pathogens. A marine bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from Eal fish of Baluchistan coast of Pakistan. This strain produced a bactericidal antibiotic against environmental and clinical isolates. In this study, we purified bactericidal antibiotic from the ethyl acetate extract of the cells of P. aeruginosa and analyzed its chemical structure. Based on spectrometric analysis, this compound 1 is proposed to be 1-methyl-1,4 dihydroquinoline and is active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA), Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Vibrio aliginolyticus, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter faecium but it is not active against G streptococci, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger. Minimal inhibitory concentration for Gram-positive bacteria was between 50 and 75 microg mL(-1) and for Gram-negative bacteria 75-100 microg mL(-1).
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of different gutta-percha points and calcium hydroxide pastes.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of different trademarks and compositions of gutta-percha points and calcium hydroxide pastes used in endodontic therapy. The evaluated material consisted of gutta-percha points containing calcium hydroxide (Roeko), gutta-percha points containing chlorhexidine (Roeko), two conventional gutta-percha points (Endo Points and Roeko) and two calcium hydroxide pastes (Calen and Calen/PMCC). Antimicrobial tests included five species of microorganisms: Escherichia coli (ATCC10538), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC12228), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC6538), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC27853), and Micrococcus luteus (ATCC9341). The Agar diffusion method was employed. The plates were kept at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion and then incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. The triphenyltetrazolium chloride gel was added for optimization and the zones of inhibition were measured. Statistical evaluation was carried out using analysis of variance and Tukey Test. The obtained results showed that all microbial species used in the study were inhibited by the gutta-percha points containing chlorhexidine and by the calcium hydroxide pastes (Calen and Calen/PMCC), with similar results (p > 0.05). No antimicrobial activity was observed for the other groups. It was concluded that the gutta-percha points containing chlorhexidine presented antimicrobial activity, whereas the gutta-percha points containing calcium hydroxide did not.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and pollen composition of honey samples collected from different provinces in Turkey.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of honey samples from different sources were collected and investigated against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 27736, Morganella morganii, Micrococcus luteus NRRL B-4375, Escherichia coli ATCC 35218, and Candida albicans. Pathogens exhibited different sensitivities towards the honey samples. The results showed that majority of the honey samples (75%) generally inhibitied the bacteria tested. The honey samples which were obtained from Izmir (samples 1 and 2) proved more effective as inhibitors against P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and S. aureus. The honey which was obtained from Mugla (sample 5) exhibited high anticandidal activity on C. albicans. A comparison of the honey samples on the basis of pollen content revealed that they were heterofloral, and samples which had highest antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and S. aureus were dominated by pollen from Chenopodiaceae/Amaranthaceae (sample 1), and Trifolium, Trigonella, Cyperaceae, Zea mays and Anthemis taxa (sample 2). The honey proved more effective on bacteria than antibiotics.
TI  - Isolation of bacillus subtilis MH-4 from soil and its potential of polypeptidic antibiotic production.
AB  - The genus Bacillus produces mainly polypeptide antibiotics such as bacitracin and polymyxin. Bacillus species were isolated from soil by soil sprinkle technique. And all were screened for the production of antibiotic. Bacillus subtilis MH-4 gave the maximum antimicrobial activity so finally selected for optimization. During optimization of culture conditions for Bacillus subtilis MH-4 best antibacterial activity was obtained at 96 hours of incubation period, at pH-8 and by using glycerol as carbon and L-glutamic acid as nitrogen source. Optimum temperature for antibiotic production was 37 degrees C. The antibiotic was confirmed to be bacitracin by paper chromatography. Antibiotic was further extracted successfully with 1-Butanol, and aqueous concentrate showed activity of 0.8 mg/ml. The antibiotic so produced was found to be narrow spectrum active against only Gram-positive bacteria.

TI  - Analytical detection and biological assay of antileukemic drug 5-fluorouracil using gold nanoparticles as probe.
AB  - Gold nanoparticles are reported and evaluated as probes for the detection of anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil (5FU). The nature of binding between 5FU and gold nanoparticles via complexation is investigated using ultraviolet visible spectrophotometry, cyclic voltammetry, transmission electron microscopy, fluorescence and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The bound antileukemic drug is fluorescent and the quenching property of gold nanoparticles could be exploited for biological investigations. The 5FU-colloidal gold complex (Au@5FU) is observed to have appreciable antibacterial and antifungal activity against Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Aspergillus niger. The experimental studies suggest that gold nanoparticles have the potential to be used as effective carriers for anticancer drugs.
TI  - Synthesis of pseudopeptides based L-tryptophan as a potential antimicrobial agent.
AB  - Four compounds named L-BTrpPA, L-Trp-o-PA, L-Trp-m-PA and L-Trp-p-PA, pseudopeptides constructed from pyridine and tryptophan units, were synthesized and tested against the Gram-positive, Gram-negative strains of bacteria and human pathogenic fungi. L-Trp-o-PA proved to be a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, showing a significant inhibition of the growth of Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus), and pathogenic fungi (Candida spp., Cryptococcus neoformans, Rhodotorula glutinis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Aspergillus spp., Rhizopus nigricans) tested and activity against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter aerogenes) tested. The in vitro cell cytotoxicity of L-Trp-o-PA was evaluated using haemolytic assay, in which the compound was found to have low lytic property, even up to the concentration of 4000 microg/mL, it only lysed 6-7% of erythrocytes, which was 100-fold greater than the MICs (minimum inhibitory concentration).
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of long-chain, water-soluble, dendritic tricarboxylato amphiphiles.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To measure the antimicrobial activities of three series of homologous, dendritic tricarboxylato (three-headed) amphiphiles against a battery of bacteria and fungi. METHODS: Three series of homologous dendritic amphiphiles were synthesized containing C13 to C22 fatty chains. Susceptibility of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Lactobacillus plantarum, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Mycobacterium smegmatis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus niger to the amphiphiles was measured by broth microdilution and reported as the MIC. RESULTS: Several amphiphiles from each homologous series, designed and constructed to overcome the low solubility of saturated long-chain fatty acids, had antimicrobial activity against MRSA (MIC = 36 mg/L), C. albicans (MIC = 4.4 mg/L), S. cerevisiae (MIC = 1.1 mg/L) and M. smegmatis (MIC = 8.9 mg/L). These amphiphiles had considerably better antimicrobial activities than the corresponding saturated fatty acids. Alkyl chain length influenced the values of MIC; longer chains (C18-C22) were generally more antimicrobial, but there was no uniform pattern among the microorganisms tested. CONCLUSIONS: As the antimicrobial activity of the amphiphiles increased with increasing chain length, it is anticipated that maximum activity was not reached with these series. Thus, the identification of the optimal chain length would provide a target compound for development of low-cost, topical microbicides and anti-infectives. Further, these series of dendritic amphiphiles with the very long chains can be used as new water-soluble probes for elucidation of membrane structure and for identification of novel targets for antimicrobial design.
TI  - Antimicrobial, wound healing and antioxidant activities of Anthocephalus cadamba.
AB  - Anthocephalus cadamba (Roxb.) Miq. Syn A. chinensis (Lamk) A. Rich (Rubiaceae) is ethnomedicinally widely used in the form of paste by tribe in western Ghats for treating skin diseases. In this context, antimicrobial potential of A. cadamba against a wide range of microorganisms was studied. To validate the ethnotherapeutic claims of the plant in skin diseases, wound healing activity was studied, besides antioxidant activity to understand the mechanism of wound healing. The alchoholic and aqueous extract of this plant showed significant antibacterial and antifungal activity against almost all the organisms: Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and four fungi Candida albicans, Trichophyton rubrum--dermatophyte fungi, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus nidulans--systemic fungi, with especially good activity against the dermatophyte (Trichophyton rubrum) and some infectious bacteria (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus aureus) with an MIC of 2.5 microg/disc. The results show that A. cadamba extract has potent wound healing capacity as shown from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. The results also indicated that A. cadamba extract possesses potent antioxidant activity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and increase in the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activity.
TI  - Total synthesis and biological evaluation of (-)-pectinatone employing a methyl-branched wax ester as key building block.
AB  - Unnatural (-)-pectinatone ((-)-3) was prepared in five steps starting from the highly methyl-branched wax ester 4, employing bromination of the ester enolate and subsequent base-induced elimination to the enoate 6 as the key step. Both (-)-3 and the amides 8b and 8c, which were isolated as by-products in the reaction sequence, displayed antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of hydrophobic xanthones from Cudrania cochinchinensis against Bacillus subtilis and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Ten xanthones with one or two isoprenoid groups and a prenylated benzophenone isolated from roots of Cudrania cochinchinensis (Moraceae) were tested for their antimicrobial activities against Bacillus subtilis and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Among these compounds, gerontoxanthone H exhibited considerable antibacterial activity against B. subtilis (MIC = 1.56 microg/ml). Four xanthones, gerontoxanthone I, toxyloxanthone C, cudraxanthone S, and 1,3,7-trihydroxy-2-prenylxanthone, showed weak antibacterial activity against the bacterium (MICs = 3.13-6.25 microg/ml). These compounds also exhibited similar MIC values against methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, MRSAs, and Micrococcus luteus.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of Lucilia sericata maggot secretions.
AB  - Maggots of the green blowfly, Lucilia sericata, are used as an alternative to surgical intervention and long-term antiseptic therapy for the treatment of chronic wounds. The secretions of maggots are known to have antibacterial properties. To quantify the bactericidal effect of secretions from larvae of L. sericata, an in vitro test model based on the modified European quantitative suspension test (EN 1040) was developed, in which a co-culture of maggots and bacteria (Micrococcus luteus,Escherichia coli, methicillin-sensitive Staphylo-coccus aureus) in tryptic soy broth was tested. The numbers of bacterial colonies with and without maggot exposure were compared after 24, 48 and 72 h of exposure. The mean log(10) reduction factor (RF) for bacterial elimination per maggot was >4 at all examined times for all tested bacteria. Thus, maggot secretion fulfilled the required definitions of an antiseptic. In addition, the maggots' ability to ingest bacteria was also evaluated. Maggots contained viable bacteria after 48 h of contact with the respective organisms. These maggots also continued excreting bacteria. Therefore, maggots should be disposed of after use as they must be regarded as medical waste.

TI  - Synthesis, structure and biological activity of cobalt(II) and copper(II) complexes of valine-derived schiff bases.
AB  - We have synthesized two cobalt(II) 2 and copper(II) 3 complexes of valine-derived Schiff bases. The obtained complexes were characterized by elemental analysis, FT-IR and X-ray diffraction. Biological studies of complexes 2 and 3 had been carried out in vitro for antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria and human pathogenic fungi. Compound 3 was proven to be a broad spectrum agent, showed a significant inhibition of the growth of Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus), and pathogenic fungi (Candida spp., Cryptococcus neoformans, Rhodothece glutinis, Saccharomyces cerevisia, Aspergillus spp., Rhizopus nigricans) tested and a moderate activity against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris and Enterobacter aerogenes) tested. The in vitro cytotoxicity of compound 3 was evaluated using hemolytic assay, in which the compound 3 was found to be non-toxic to human erythrocytes even at a concentration of 500mug/mL.
TI  - Cytotoxic, antioxidant and antibacterial activities of Varthemia iphionoides Boiss. extracts.
AB  - The hexane, ethyl acetate, chloroform, ethanol and water extracts of aerial parts of Varthemia, Varthemia iphionoides, were investigated for cytotoxic activity against human myelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells; DPPH radical-scavenging activity; antioxidative activity in the linoleic acid system; reducing power; antibacterial activity; the contents of phenolic compounds. A pronounced cytotoxic effect on human leukemia (HL-60) cells was shown in the hexane, chloroform and ethanol extracts, with inhibition of 89.0, 68.4 and 62.3%, respectively, at a concentration of 200 microg extract/ml. High DPPH radical-scavenging activity, antioxidative activity in the linoleic acid system and reducing power were found in the water and ethanol extracts, and were correlated to the contents of phenolic compounds. Antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Salmonella enteritides was shown in the ethyl acetate and chloroform extracts. A compound responsible for the antibacterial activity was isolated from the ethyl acetate extract, and identified as 3-oxocostusic acid.
TI  - Search for antibacterial and antifungal agents from selected Indian medicinal plants.
AB  - A series of 61 Indian medicinal plants belonging to 33 different families used in various infectious disorders, were screened for their antimicrobial properties. Screening was carried out at 1000 and 500 microg/ml concentrations by agar dilution method against Bacillus cereus var mycoides, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus subtilis, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Twenty-eight plant extracts showed activity against at least one of the test organisms used in the screening. On the basis of the results obtained, we conclude that the crude extracts of Dorema ammoniacum, Sphaeranthus indicus, Dracaena cinnabari, Mallotus philippinensis, Jatropha gossypifolia, Aristolochia indica, Lantana camara, Nardostachys jatamansi, Randia dumetorum and Cassia fistula exhibited significant antimicrobial activity and properties that support folkloric use in the treatment of some diseases as broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. This probably explains the use of these plants by the indigenous people against a number of infections.
TI  - Antifungal and antibacterial activities of Araucaria araucana (Mol.) K. Koch heartwood lignans.
AB  - Five lignans (secoisolariciresinol, pinoresinol, eudesmin, lariciresinol, and lariciresinol-4-methyl ether) were isolated from an MeOH extract from Araucaria araucana (Mol.) K. Koch wood for the first time in this species and their structures determined with spectroscopic methods. The antimicrobial activities of these compounds were determined for the bacteria Citrobacter sp., Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and for the white rooting and staining fungi Mucor miehei, Paecilomyces variotii, Ceratocystis pilifera, Trametes versicolor, and Penicillium notatum, and in addition, the MeOH extract was evaluated against Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans, Fusarium moniliforme, F. sporotrichum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. The most sensitive bacteria against pinoresinol were the Gram-positive. However, secoisolariciresinol exhibited a significant antifungal activity on fungi of white rooting and wood staining and this compound completely inhibited the mycelial growth of T. versicolor and C. pilifera at 300 and 400 microg per disc, respectively, whereas pinoresinol showed a moderate inhibitory activity. On the other hand, the MeOH extract had the highest activity against rooting and staining and pathogenic fungi as well as T. versicolor, Fusarium spp. and Trichophyton mentagrophytes, inhibiting completely the growth at 400 microg per disc.
TI  - Antimicrobial, wound healing and antioxidant activity of Plagiochasma appendiculatum Lehm. et Lind.
AB  - Plagiochasma appendiculatum (Aytoniaceae) of the order Marchantiales is widely used in the form of paste ethnomedicinally by Gaddi tribe in Kangra valley for treating skin diseases. In this context, antimicrobical potential of Plagiochasma appendiculatum against a wide range of microorganisms was studied. To validate the ethnotherapeutic claims of the plant in skin diseases, wound healing activity was studied, besides antioxidant activity to understand the mechanism of wound healing activity. The plant (alchoholic and aqueous extract) showed significant antibacterial and antifungal activity against almost all the organisms: Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, and eight fungi Candida albicans and Cryptococcus albidus-dimorphic fungi, Trichophyton rubrum-dermatophyte fungi, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus spinulosus, Aspergillus terreus and Aspergillus nidulans-systemic fungi, with especially good activity against the dermatophyte (Trichophyton rubrum) and some infectious bacteria (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella typhimurium) with an MIC of 2.5 microg/disc. The results show that Plagiochasma appendiculatum extract has potent wound healing capacity as evident from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. The results also indicated that Plagiochasma appendiculatum extract possesses potent antioxidant activity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and increase in the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Catalase activity.
TI  - Design, synthesis, antibacterial, and QSAR studies of myristic acid derivatives.
AB  - A series of esters and amides of myristic acid was synthesized and tested in vitro for antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. All the compounds showed activity comparable to that of the standard drug, ciprofloxacin. The structural characteristics governing antibacterial activity of myristic acid derivatives was studied using QSAR methodology. The results showed that the antibacterial activity could be modeled using the topological descriptor, valence molecular connectivity index. The predictive ability of the models was cross-validated by construction of a test set. The low residual activity and high cross-validated r2 values (r(cv)2) observed indicated the predictive ability of the developed QSAR models.
TI  - Antimicrobial spectrum, production and mode of action of staphylococcin 188 produced by Staphylococcus aureus 188.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus 188 has been shown to produce bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance known as staphylococcin 188. It has a broad-activity spectrum against Micrococcus luteus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus viridans, Corynebacterium diphtheriae and several staphylococcus species. The arbitrary unit of staphylococcin 188 against Micrococcus luteus was 1280 AU/mL. Its production with simultaneous measurement of activity was monitored and was found to produce maximum amount of staphylococcin after 7 hours of incubation. Mode of action of the staphylococcin 188 on the sensitive cells was bactericidal rather than bacterioloytic.
TI  - Cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells by using chitosan-immobilized silica.
AB  - Cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells were conducted by using chitosan-immobilized silica (CIS). When chitosan was immobilized onto silica surfaces with glutaraldehyde, bacterial cells adsorbed well and retained viability. Testing of the adsorption and desorption ability of CIS using various microbes such as Escherichia coli, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus salivarius, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces ludwigii, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe revealed that most microbes could be adsorbed and selectively desorbed under different conditions. In particular, recovery was improved when L-cysteine was added. A mixture of two bacterial strains adsorbed onto CIS could also be successfully separated by use of specific solutions for each strain. Most of the desorbed cells were alive. Thus, quantitative and selective fractionation of cells is readily achievable by employing chitosan, a known antibacterial material.
TI  - In vitro deposition of lysozyme on etafilcon A and balafilcon A hydrogel contact  lenses: effects on adhesion and survival of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare lysozyme adsorption and absorption and bacterial adhesion interactions on conventional (etafilcon A) and silicone (balafilcon A) hydrogel contact lenses. METHOD: Lysozyme concentrations and activities associated with the lenses were determined after solvent extraction (trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile) and directly on the lenses without extraction with micrococcal- and micro-bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assays. Cells of bacteria with radiolabeled leucine and a cell recovery procedure were used in determinations of bacterial adhesion to lenses. RESULTS: Lysozyme was adsorbed and absorbed to the conventional etafilcon A lens at about a 10-fold greater concentration than to the balafilcon A silicone hydrogel lens. Enzyme activities on the surfaces of both lenses were similar but replenished after saline extraction only with the etafilcon A lens. Lysozyme on the lens surface showed significant lysis of Micrococcus luteus but had a negligible effect on the adhesion and survival of Staphylococcus aureus. Lysozyme did not appear to affect the survival of Pseudomonas aeruginosa on lenses. CONCLUSION: In vitro experiments show that concentrations of active lysozyme on the surface of the etafilcon A lens, unlike the balafilcon A lens which showed negligible absorption, may be sustained from the lens matrix. Lysozyme deposited on hydrogel lenses had marked activity against M. luteus but relatively minor effects on the primary adhesion of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus.
TI  - Peptidoglycan recognition by the Drosophila Imd pathway.
AB  - The structural requirements for recognition of peptidoglycan (PGN) by PGRP-LC and activation of the Drosophila IMD pathway are not yet clear. In order to examine this question more carefully, the activity of peptidoglycan from different types of bacteria was compared in cell-based and whole animal assays. Drosophila S2* cells, but not adult flies, responded to Lys-type Micrococcus luteus PGN, but with significantly less potency compared to Dap-type Escherichia coli PGN, while intact Lys-type PGN from Staphylococcus aureus was inactive. After treatment with lysostaphin, which digests the cross-bridging peptides, S. aureus PGN weakly stimulated the IMD pathway, similar to M. luteus PGN. Further digestion with mutanolysin, which creates monomeric PGN fragments, abolished the activity of S. aureus PGN. On the other hand, monomeric E. coli PGN, generated by mutanolysin digestion, was still active but required different isoforms of PGRP-LC for recognition. Polymeric PGN required only PGRP-LCx, while monomeric E. coli PGN required both the PGRP-LCa and PGRP-LCx isoforms. These results suggest that the recognition by PGRP-LCx alone requires polymeric PGN, and that polymeric Dap-type PGN is a more potent PGRP-LCx agonist, compared to Lys-type PGN. These results also suggest that the heteromeric PGRP-LCa/LCx receptor complex recognizes monomeric Dap-type, but not Lys-type, PGN.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of 2-arylbenzofurans from Morus species against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Nine 2-arylbenzofurans isolated from Morus species were tested for their antimicrobial activities against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Among these compounds, chalcomoracin (a leaf phytoalexine of mulberry tree) exhibited considerable antibacterial activity against MRSAs (MICs 0.78 mug/ml).
TI  - Antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-cholinesterase and mutagenic effects of extracts obtained from some trees used in South African traditional medicine.
AB  - Extracts obtained from 10 trees used in South African traditional medicine were screened for antibacterial, anti-inflammatory (COX-1 and COX-2) and anti-cholinesterase activities and investigated for potential mutagenic effects using the Ames test. Antibacterial activity was detected using the disc-diffusion and micro-dilution assays. The extracts were tested against Gram-positive bacteria: Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus and Gram-negative bacteria: Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Of the 78 different plant extracts investigated, 80% showed activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in the disc-diffusion assay. In the micro-dilution assay, 60% of the plant extracts showed minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values < or =1.56 mg ml(-1). The lowest MIC value (0.092 mg ml(-1)) was recorded for an ethyl acetate root extract of Acacia sieberiana against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. In the anti-inflammatory assay, 70% of the investigated plant extracts (0.25 mg ml(-1)) inhibited both COX-1 and COX-2 activity (>50% and 70% for water and organic solvent extracts, respectively). An ethyl acetate leaf extract of Trichilia dregeana showed selective inhibition of COX-2 (81%). In the acetylcholinesterase inhibitory test, 21% of the plant extracts were active at a concentration < or =1 mg ml(-1) using the micro-dilution assay. The lowest IC(50) value was 0.04 mg ml(-1) obtained with an ethanol bark extract of Combretum kraussii. None of the investigated plants showed any potential mutagenic effects.
TI  - A study on inhibitory effects of Sigla tree (Liquidambar orientalis Mill. var. orientalis) storax against several bacteria.
AB  - In this study, Sigla (Liquidambar orientalis Mill.) storax (styrax) was investigated for antibacterial activity against Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, B. brevis, B. cereus, B. megaterium, B. subtilis, Corynebacterium xerosis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Micrococcus luteus, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, Staphylococcus aureus and Yersinia enterocolitica. The storax was dissolved in absolute ethanol and was tested at concentrations of 10.0%, 1.0%, 0.4%, 0.2% and 0.1%. Pure ethanol was used for the control. The antibacterial activity of the Sigla storax was determined by using the agar diffusion method. The growths of A. hydrophila, B. amyloliquefaciens, B. megaterium, E. coli, E. coli O157:H7, L. monocytogenes and Y. enterocolitica were not inhibited by any of the concentrations of Sigla storax. The results showed that Sigla storax has antibacterial activity against many bacteria at concentrations of 10.0% and against some bacteria at concentrations of 1.0%, 0.4% and 0.2%.
TI  - Mycosubtilin overproduction by Bacillus subtilis BBG100 enhances the organism's antagonistic and biocontrol activities.
AB  - A Bacillus subtilis derivative was obtained from strain ATCC 6633 by replacement  of the native promoter of the mycosubtilin operon by a constitutive promoter originating from the replication gene repU of the Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pUB110. The recombinant strain, designated BBG100, produced up to 15-fold more mycosubtilin than the wild type produced. The overproducing phenotype was related to enhancement of the antagonistic activities against several yeasts and pathogenic fungi. Hemolytic activities were also clearly increased in the modified strain. Mass spectrometry analyses of enriched mycosubtilin extracts showed similar patterns of lipopeptides for BBG100 and the wild type. Interestingly, these analyses also revealed a new form of mycosubtilin which was more easily detected in the BBG100 sample. When tested for its biocontrol potential, wild-type strain ATCC 6633 was almost ineffective for reducing a Pythium infection of tomato seedlings. However, treatment of seeds with the BBG100 overproducing strain resulted in a marked increase in the germination rate of seeds. This protective effect afforded by mycosubtilin overproduction was also visualized by the significantly greater fresh weight of emerging seedlings treated with BBG100 compared to controls or seedlings inoculated with the wild-type strain.
TI  - Novel phenolic glycoside dimer and trimer from the whole herb of Pyrola rotundifolia.
AB  - From the water-soluble constituents of the whole herb of Pyrola rotundifolia (Pyrolaceae), one novel phenolic glycoside dimer, pyrolaside A (1), and one novel phenolic glycoside trimer, pyrolaside B (2), together with two known phenolic glycosides homoarbutin (3) and isohomoarbutin (4), were isolated. The structures were elucidated by spectroscopic analysis and confirmed with chemical degradation. In vitro tests for antimicrobial activity showed pyrolaside B (2) to possess significant activity against two Gram-positive organisms, Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of Fill Canal, Sealapex, Mineral Trioxide Aggregate, Portland cement and EndoRez.
AB  - AIM: To determine in vitro the antimicrobial activity of Fill Canal, Sealapex, Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA), Portland cement and EndoRez on various species of microorganisms. METHODOLOGY: The diffusion method on Muller-Hinton agar (MH) was employed. A base layer was made using MH agar and five wells were made by removing agar at equidistant points. Sealers were placed into the wells immediately after manipulation. The microorganisms Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were seeded by pour plate. The plates were kept at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion and then incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. Aliquots of 10 mL of 0.05% triphenyltetrazolium chloride gel were added for optimization and the zones of inhibition were measured. RESULTS: Sealapex and Fill Canal demonstrated antimicrobial activity for all strains. For MTA and Portland cement, only E. coli was not inhibited. No antimicrobial activity was detected for EndoRez. CONCLUSIONS: In this laboratory study, Fill Canal, Sealapex, MTA and Portland cement presented antimicrobial activity whilst EndoRez did not.
TI  - Bioactivity guided isolation of antimicrobial compounds from Lythrum salicaria.
AB  - Lythrum salicaria extracts showed activity against the phytopathogenic fungus Cladosporium cucumerinum and activity against the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis and Microccocus luteus. Bioautography on thin-layer chromatograms was used to isolate the two antifungal triterpenoids oleanolic and ursolic acid. The hexahydroxydiphenoyl ester vescalagin was isolated as active principle of the antibacterial activity. Furthermore, the flavon-C-glucosides vitexin, isovitexin, orientin and isoorientin were isolated.
TI  - Correlation between the activities of alpha-helical antimicrobial peptides and hydrophobicities represented as RP HPLC retention times.
AB  - PTP7 is a 13-amino acid residue peptide designed from gaegurin 6, an antimicrobial peptide isolated from skin secretions of Rana rugosa. In order to examine the effect of hydrophobicity on antimicrobial activity, a series of PTP7 derivatives were constructed and analyzed the activity against bacteria and artificial membrane. We found that the mean hydrophobicity by simple summation of hydrophobicity of each constituent amino acid did not necessarily describe the hydrophobic property of antimicrobial peptides. The mean hydrophobicity did not show close correlation with the observed hydrophobicity by measuring reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP HPLC) retention time. The observed hydrophobicity represented as RP HPLC retention time correlated well with the activity against artificial membrane and Gram positive bacterial species, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Micrococcus luteus, rather than mean hydrophobicity. However, antimicrobial activity against Gram negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, did not show correlation with RP HPLC retention time. These data indicate that the RP HPLC retention time should be exploited rather than the mean hydrophobicity in the analysis of the relationship between hydrophobicity and antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Chemical compositions and antimicrobial activities of four different Anatolian propolis samples.
AB  - Propolis means a gum that is gathered by bees from various plants. It is known for its biological properties, having antibacterial, antifungal and healing properties. The aims of this study were to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of four different Anatolian propolis samples on different groups of microorganisms including some oral pathogens and comparison between their chemical compositions. Ethanol extracts of propolis (EEP) were prepared from four different Anatolian propolis samples and examined whether EEP inhibit the growth of the test microorganisms or not. For the antimicrobial activity assays, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined by using macrodilution method. The MIC values of the most effective propolis (TB) were 2 microg/ml for Streptococcus sobrinus and Enterococcus faecalis, 4 microg/ml for Micrococcus luteus, Candida albicans and C. krusei, 8 microg/ml for Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterobacter aerogenes, 16 microg/ml for Escherichia coli and C. tropicalis and 32 microg/ml for Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The chemical compositions of EEP's were determined by high-temperature high-resolution gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The main compounds of four Anatolian propolis samples were flavonoids such as pinocembrin, pinostropin, isalpinin, pinobanksin, quercetin, naringenin, galangine and chrysin. Although propolis samples were collected from different regions of Anatolia all showed significant antimicrobial activity against the Gram positive bacteria and yeasts. Propolis can prevent dental caries since it demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms such as Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus and C. albicans, which involves in oral diseases.
TI  - Antibacterial screening of anthocyanic and proanthocyanic fractions from cranberry juice.
AB  - The effect of anthocyanin- and proanthocyanidin-rich fractions isolated from cranberry juice was studied for their antibacterial activity against nine bacterial strains. Activity was assessed by the agar diffusion assay. Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 was the only strain to exhibit some susceptibility to four out of 10 anthocyanin-rich fractions tested. A variable susceptibility of S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 10541, and Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341 to proanthocyanidin- rich fractions was also observed. Streptococcus mutans strains as well as Escherichia coli ATCC 10538 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 were not susceptible to any of the cranberry juice samples or fractions at the tested concentrations. There was no clear correlation between Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacterial susceptibility to cranberry juice. In this work, the role of cranberry juice anthocyanic and proanthocyanic fractions upon bacterial viability is discussed.
TI  - Cecropin P1 and novel nematode cecropins: a bacteria-inducible antimicrobial peptide family in the nematode Ascaris suum.
AB  - Cecropin P1 was first identified as a mammalian antimicrobial peptide isolated from the pig intestine. Much research aimed at characterizing this peptide has been reported. Recently, the workers who discovered the peptide corrected their original conclusion, and confirmed that this peptide originates in fact from the pig intestinal parasitic nematode, Ascaris suum. In the present study, we carried out a semi-exhaustive search for bacteria-inducible transcripts in A. suum by the cDNA subtraction method. The transcripts encoding cecropin P1 and novel Ascaris cecropins, designated cecropins P2, P3 and P4, were found to be positively induced factors. Chemically synthesized Ascaris cecropins were bactericidal against a wide range of microbes, i.e. Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Micrococcus luteus) and Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescens and Esherichia coli) bacteria, and were weakly but detectably active against yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans). Cecropin P1-like sequences were also detected at least in two other species (Ascaris lumbricoides and Toxocara canis) of the Ascarididae. All Ascaris cecropin precursors contain an acidic pro-region connected by a tetra-basic cleavage site at the C-terminus. Such an acidic pro-region is also reported to be present in the tunicate cecropin-type antimicrobial peptide styelin. On the basis of the evolutionary position of nematodes and tunicates, the ancestral cecropin may have contained the acidic pro-region at the C-terminus.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of microorganisms from instruments used by pedicurists operating within Lagos metropolis, Nigeria.
AB  - Eight bacterial and five fungal species were isolated from swab samples taken from instruments used by pedicurists operating at three different sites in Lagos, Nigeria. The bacterial isolates included Micrococcus luteus, Micrococcus roseus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Hafnia spp, Shigella spp, Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus spp. The five fungal isolates were identified as Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Mucor spp, Trichophyton spp and Candida albicans. The presence of these microorganisms, some of which are pathogenic, is an indication that pedicurists could be contributing towards the spread of skin and nail infections within the Lagos metropolis.
TI  - [Antimicrobial properties of bee preparations in ointment form].
AB  - High antimicrobial activity apiphytopreparation in the form of the ointments containing pine turpentine, different concentration of propolis (from 4 to 20 %), honey and carotene oil from carrots (ointment N 4) has been. While testing by the method of diffusion in agar all the studied apiphytopreparation suppressed growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Micrococcus luteus, M. roseus. This effect increased with propolis content increase in the content of ointments. Bee honey and carotene oil intensified their antimicrobial activity. The latter was caused by the action of phenolic compounds, ether oils and other biologically active substances--the apiculture and vegetative raw material.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of an eudesmane sesquiterpene isolated from common Varthemia, Varthemia iphionoides.
AB  - The ethyl acetate extract of the whole aerial parts of Varthemia iphionoides (Compositae) showed a pronounced antibacterial activity. The bioassay-guided fractionation of the ethyl acetate extract and further purification of the most antibacterially active fraction led to the isolation and identification of an antibacterial sesquiterpene, selina-4,11(13)-dien-3-on-12-oic acid. This compound exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against six bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Salmonella enteritides). The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of this compound which was determined by the agar dilution method ranged between 250 and 500 microg/ml.
TI  - Synthesis of Schiff bases of 4-(4-aminophenyl)-morpholine as potential antimicrobial agents.
AB  - In the present study, a novel series of Schiff bases of 4-(4-aminophenyl)-morpholine were synthesised and characterised by IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, Mass spectral and elemental analysis. The compounds were screened for antibacterial (Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 9144), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 155), Bacillus cereus (ATCC 11778), Micrococcus luteus (ATCC 4678), and Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922)) and antifungal (Candida albicans (ATCC 2091) and Aspergillus niger (ATCC 9029)) activities. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of the compounds were also ascertained by agar streak dilution method. 4-(4-(4-Hydroxy-benzylidene-imino)phenyl)-morpholine (7) was found to be the most potent antimicrobial activity with MIC of 25, 19, 21, 16, 29, 20 and 40 microg/ml against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, B. cereus, M. luteus, E. coli, C. albicans and A. niger, respectively. All the other compounds exhibited moderate activity against the bacterial and fungal organisms tested.
TI  - Antibacterial activity from Penicillium corylophilum Dierckx.
AB  - A strain of Penicillium corylophilum isolated from Brazilian soil sample was submitted to different culture conditions to investigate the production of secondary metabolites with antimicrobial activity. The largest number of conidia was obtained after 5 days of incubation in oat medium and the highest level of antimicrobial activity was produced when the fungus culture was developed in the Czapek medium. The activity against Staphylococcus aureus was found only in the chloroform extract from Czapek culture broth, which also showed activity against Micrococcus luteus. Fumiquinozoline F was isolated from the active chloroform extract by using chromatographic methods. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for M. luteus and S. aureus were 99 microg/ mL and 137microg/mL, respectively.
TI  - Synthesis and study of antibacterial and antifungal activities of novel 2-[[(benzoxazole/benzimidazole-2-yl)sulfanyl] acetylamino]thiazoles.
AB  - Several 2-[[(benzoxazole/benzimidazole-2-yl)sulfanyl]acetylamino]thiazoles derivatives were synthesized by reacting 4-substituted-2-(chloroacetylamino)thiazoles with benzoxazole/benzimidazole-2-thioles in acetone and in the presence of K2CO3. The chemical structures of the compounds were elucidated by IR, 1H-NMR, and FAB(+)-MS spectral data. Their antimicrobial activities against Micrococcus luteus (NRLL B-4375), Bacillus cereus (NRRL B-3711), Proteus vulgaris (NRRL B-123), Salmonella typhimurium (NRRL B-4420), Staphylococcus aureus (NRRL B-767), Escherichia coli (NRRL B-3704), Candida albicans and Candida globrata (isolates obtained from Osmangazi Uni. Fac.of Medicine) were investigated and in this investigation, a significant level of activity was illustrated.
TI  - [Interaction of neomycin with other antibiotics on selected bacterial strains].
AB  - Antimicrobial combinations are used most frequently to provide broad-spectrum empirical coverage in the treatment of bacterial infections. However, combination of two antibiotics may not influence their activity, may lead to synergy or antagonism in the activity. Neomycin may be combined with one of the following antibiotics: ampicillin, procaine penicillin, gramicidin, bacitracin, polymyxin B, lincomycin, oxytetracycline, and erythromycin in some human and veterinary multiantibiotic drugs distributed in Poland. The checkerboard method has been one of the traditional assays for the measurement of antibiotic interactions. The aim of this study was to analyse the activity interaction of neomycin with second antibiotic in multiantibiotic drugs distributed in Poland on standards and clinical bacterial strains. Checkerboard results for all strains demonstrated synergism for 2.5% of combinations, only for standards strains. In one case Salmonella Enteritidis, in combination of neomycin with bacitracin, inhibition effect was observed. Additive effects were predominant--49%. In 18% neutral effects were shown, but in 26% of combinations FIC indexes were not possible to calculate, because of the resistance of clinical strains to the highest concentration of at least one antibiotic. In combination of aminoglycoside (neomycin) with beta-lactams antibiotics (ampicillin, procaine penicillin) in vitro, no synergy was observed for all examined strains. The best results were achieved for combinations of neomycin with peptide antibiotics (polymyxin, gramicidin and bacitracin)--5 for all 6 synergy effect observed.
TI  - Cyclic dipeptides exhibit synergistic, broad spectrum antimicrobial effects and have anti-mutagenic properties.
AB  - Cyclic dipeptides are known to have antiviral, antibiotic and antitumour properties. The aim of this study was to determine the combined effects of cyclo(L-leucyl-L-prolyl) and cyclo(L-phenylalanyl-L-prolyl) on the growth of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and pathogenic yeasts, as well as determining their anti-mutagenic effects. This drug combination was especially effective against five VRE strains: Enterococcus faecium (K-99-38), E. faecalis (K-99-17), E. faecalis (K-99-258), E. faecium (K-01-312) and E. faecalis (K-01-511) with MIC values of 0.25-1 mg/l. It was also effective against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans with MIC values of 0.25-0.5 mg/l. In addition, the cyclic dipeptides exerted anti-mutagenic activity against Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 strains in a Salmonella mutation assay. The number of mutant colonies of S. typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 induced by exposure to AF-2 (0.2 microg/plate) decreased in a concentration-dependent manner in the presence of the two cyclic dipeptides (correlation 0.72 and 0.78, respectively). Here, for the first time, we report synergistic effects of the cyclic dipeptides [cyclo(L-leu-L-pro) and cyclo(L-phe-L-pro)] in inhibiting the growth of pathogenic microorganisms, as well as their anti-mutagenic effects in Salmonella strains.
TI  - Expression of the peptidoglycan recognition protein, PGRP, in the lactating mammary gland.
AB  - The peptidoglycan recognition protein, PGRP, known as an intracellular component  of neutrophils, has been isolated from camel (Camelus dromedarius) milk by acid precipitation followed by heparin-sepharose affinity chromatography of the supernatant. The mean concentration in milk was about 120 mg/L. It decreased during lactation by 19% and increased in the event of severe mastitis by 45%. The protein bound to lactic acid bacteria and other gram-positive bacteria with an affinity similar to that reported for the human and murine orthologs, although the isoelectric point of the molecule was distinctly higher at pH 9.02. The N-terminus of mature camel PGRP was determined as NH2-ArgGluAspProPro-CO2H. Calculated and measured molecular masses were both 19.1 kDa, excluding the possibility of posttranslational modifcation or binding of cation ligands. The peptide probably builds a homotrimer at high concentration. The corresponding mRNA was isolated from lactating mammary gland tissue, and 5.3 kbp of the corresponding gene was sequenced. Similarities were found to the camel lactoferrin gene with regard to sites of expression and to the region 5' upstream to the gene.
TI  - Evaluation of antibacterial properties of some medicinal plants used in Iran.
AB  - Forty-five species of 29 plant families used in the traditional medicine by Iranian people, showed antibacterial activities against one or more of the bacterial species: Bacillus cereus, Bacillus pumilus, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. No plant showed activity against Serratia marcescens; Bordetella bronchiseptica being the most susceptible species. All extracts showed the same activity 18 months later.
TI  - Validation of microbial recovery from hydrogen peroxide-sterilized air.
AB  - The use of hydrogen peroxide as a sanitant in isolators and other barrier systems is well documented. To confirm that the isolator maintains a germ-free environment between decontamination cycles, microbiological air monitoring is performed after the sanitation and aeration cycles. In this study, we have shown that residual levels of hydrogen peroxide as low as 1 ppm can remain in the isolator and inhibit the growth of microorganisms after concentration on agar media. This lingering hydrogen peroxide can make accurate microbiological air monitoring difficult and can even cause false negative test results. To solve this issue, we have developed a new media that can mediate the effects of residual peroxide and prevent false negative test results. Initially, catalase was tested as a neutralizing agent but proved not to be efficient enough. Instead, 1% pyruvate was added, which was able to tolerate as much as 15 ppm Vaporous Hydrogen Peroxide (VHP) and ensured growth promotion of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger. The 1% pyruvate retained its neutralizing activity for Micrococcus luteus at up to 100 ppm VHP. Raising the pyruvate concentration to 5% pyruvate enabled neutralization of up to 300 ppm VHP, permitting subsequent growth of Micrococcus luteus on agar media.
TI  - Antibacterial screening of plants used in Iranian folkloric medicine.
AB  - Fifty methanolic plant extracts belonging to 44 plant species of 33 families finding use in Iranian folkloric medicine were screened for antibacterial activity. Thirty samples, including 28 species in 20 families, had antibacterial activity against at least on one of the bacteria. Among the active plants, 32.6% were active against G(-), 62% against G(+), and 47.3% against both G(-) and G(+) bacteria. Dianthus coryophyllus was active against all tested G(-) and G(+) bacteria except Micrococcus luteus. Most susceptible G(-) bacteria were Klebsiella pneumoniae and Bordetella bronchiseptica and least susceptible G(-) bacterium was Escherichia coli. In G(+) bacteria, most and least susceptible were Staphylococcus aureus and M. luteus, respectively. The least MIC, as 0.62 mg/ml, belonged to Myrtus communis seeds against S. aureus, Bacillus cereus and B. bronchiseptica, and to Terminalia chebula ripe seeds against S. aureus.
TI  - Characterization of a broad range antimicrobial substance from Bacillus cereus.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this research was to isolate and characterize an antimicrobial substance from the Bacillus cereus type strain ATCC 14579. METHODS AND RESULTS: A substance with antimicrobial activity was isolated from B. cereus ATCC 14579. The substance was produced during late exponential growth and well into the stationary phase with a maximum 9 h after inoculation. The inhibitory substance was purified by reverse-phase HPLC and shown to be highly active against closely related Bacillus spp. Clinically relevant species such as Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus were also inhibited. The substance was characterized as a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (BLIS) with a molecular mass of ca 3.4 kDa. The BLIS was very heat stable, and sensitive only to pronase E and proteinase K. Antimicrobial activity was stable and high in the pH range of 2.0-9.0, and relatively unaffected by organic chemicals. CONCLUSIONS: An antimicrobial substance produced by the B. cereus type strain ATCC 14579 was characterized, with a wide spectrum of activity and the potential to be applied as a control agent against pathogenic bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The present study is the first report of a substance with antimicrobial activity from the B. cereus type strain.
TI  - Differential activation of the NF-kappaB-like factors Relish and Dif in Drosophila melanogaster by fungi and Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The current model of immune activation in Drosophila melanogaster suggests that fungi and Gram-positive (G(+)) bacteria activate the Toll/Dif pathway and that Gram-negative (G(-)) bacteria activate the Imd/Relish pathway. To test this model, we examined the response of Relish and Dif (Dorsal-related immunity factor) mutants to challenge by various fungi and G(+) and G(-) bacteria. In Relish mutants, the Cecropin A gene was induced by the G(+) bacteria Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus aureus, but not by other G(+) or G(-) bacteria. This Relish-independent Cecropin A induction was blocked in Dif/Relish double mutant flies. Induction of the Cecropin A1 gene by M. luteus required Relish, whereas induction of the Cecropin A2 gene required Dif. Intact peptidoglycan (PG) was necessary for this differential induction of Cecropin A. PG extracted from M. luteus induced Cecropin A in Relish mutants, whereas PGs from the G(+) bacteria Bacillus megaterium and Bacillus subtilis did not, suggesting that the Drosophila immune system can distinguish PGs from various G(+) bacteria. Various fungi stimulated antimicrobial peptides through at least two different pathways requiring Relish and/or Dif. Induction of Attacin A by Geotrichum candidum required Relish, whereas activation by Beauvaria bassiana required Dif, suggesting that the Drosophila immune system can distinguish between at least these two fungi. We conclude that the Drosophila immune system is more complex than the current model. We propose a new model to account for this immune system complexity, incorporating distinct pattern recognition receptors of the Drosophila immune system, which can distinguish between various fungi and G(+) bacteria, thereby leading to selective induction of antimicrobial peptides via differential activation of Relish and Dif.
TI  - Beta-1,3-glucan recognition protein-2 (betaGRP-2)from Manduca sexta; an acute-phase protein that binds beta-1,3-glucan and lipoteichoic acid to aggregate fungi and bacteria and stimulate prophenoloxidase activation.
AB  - We have isolated and characterized a new beta-1,3-glucan recognition protein that is present in Manduca sexta cuticle and hemolymph. This 52 kDa protein, designated betaGRP-2, is 57% identical in sequence to betaGRP-1 from larval hymolymph of the same insect. BetaGRP-2 differs from betaGRP-1 in its absence of the naive larvae before the wandering stage begins. Transcription of the betaGRP-2 was up-regulated in larvae challenged with yeast or bacteria. BetaGRP-2 contains a region with sequence similarity to several glucanases but lacks glucanase activity. It aggregates yeasts and bacteria to, perhaps, limit the spread of invading cells and ensure a localized defense reaction. BetaGRP-2 binds laminarin and lipoteichoic acid, but not lipopolysaccharide. Laminarin-triggered prophenoloxidase activation was greatly enhanced in the induced larval hemolymph supplemented with purified betaGRP-2. Complementing other studies on pattern recognition molecules in M. sexta, these results indicate that a complex system of protein sensors is an integral component of the insect immune system and that different recognition molecules have overlapping binding specificity and functions.
TI  - Inhibition of sortase, a bacterial surface protein anchoring transpeptidase, by beta-sitosterol-3-O-glucopyranoside from Fritillaria verticillata.
AB  - A glucosylsterol, beta-sitosterol-3-O-glucopyranoside, has been isolated as an active principle with sortase inhibitory effect from the bulbs of Fritillaria verticillata by bioassay-guided chromatographic fractionation. The isolate was a potent inhibitor of sortase, with an IC(50) value of 18.3 microg/ml and had antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Micrococcus leuteus with MIC values of 50, 200, and 400 microg/ml, respectively, indicating that this compound is a possible candidate for the development of a bacterial sortase inhibitor. In addition, sitosterol was found to be inactive upon sortase and bacterial cell growth. These results suggest that the inhibitory potency of beta-sitosterol-3-O-glucopyranoside is sensitively dependent upon the glucopyranoside side chain moiety.
TI  - Screening chemical composition and in vitro antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of the essential oils from Origanum syriacum L. growing in Turkey.
AB  - In the present study, essential oil from the leaves of Syrian oreganum [Origanum  syriacum L. (Lauraceae)] grown in Turkish state forests of the Dortyol district, Turkey, was obtained by steam distillation. The chemical composition of oil was analysed by GC and GC-MS, and was found to contain 49.02% monoterpenes, 36.60% oxygenated monoterpenes and 12.59% sesquiterpenes. The major components are as follows: gamma-terpinene, carvacrol, p-cymene and beta-caryophyllene. Subsequently, the reducing power, antioxidant and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical-scavenging activities of the essential oil were studied. The reducing power was compared with ascorbic acid, and the other activities were compared with 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methyl phenol (BHT, butylated hydroxytoluene). The results showed that the activities were concentration dependent. The antioxidant activities of the oil were slightly lower than those of ascorbic acid or BHT, so the oil can be considered an effective natural antioxidant. Antimicrobial activities of the essential oil from the leaves of Origanum syriacum was also determined on 16 microorganisms tested using the agar-disc diffusion method, and showed antimicrobial activity against 13 of these.
TI  - Antibacterial activity and mechanism of action of tick defensin against Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Defensins are a major group of antimicrobial peptides and are found widely in vertebrates, invertebrates and plants. Invertebrate defensins have been identified from insects, scorpions, mussels and ticks. In this study, chemically synthesized tick defensin was used to further investigate the activity spectrum and mode of action of natural tick defensin. Synthetic tick defensin showed antibacterial activity against many Gram-positive bacteria but not Gram-negative bacteria and low hemolytic activity, characteristic of invertebrate defensins. Furthermore, bactericidal activity against pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria including Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was observed. However, more than 30 min was necessary for tick defensin to completely kill bacteria. The interaction of tick defensin with the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane and its ability to disrupt the membrane potential was analyzed. Tick defensin was able to disrupt the membrane potential over a period of 30-60 min consistent with its relatively slow killing. Transmission electron microscopy of Micrococcus luteus treated with tick defensin showed lysis of the cytoplasmic membrane and leakage of cellular cytoplasmic contents. These findings suggest that the primary mechanism of action of tick defensin is bacterial cytoplasmic membrane lysis. In addition, incomplete cell division with multiple cross-wall formation was occasionally seen in tick defensin-treated bacteria showing pleiotropic secondary effects of tick defensin.
TI  - Synthesis of 6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-quinoline-3-carboxylic acid derivatives as potential antimicrobial agents.
AB  - In the present study, a series of 1-ethyl/benzyl-6-fluoro-7-(substituted piperazin-1-yl)1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-quinoline-3-carboxylic acid were synthesized and characterized by IR, 1H-NMR, mass spectral and elemental analysis. The in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activities of the compounds were evaluated by paper disc diffusion method. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the compounds were also determined by agar streak dilution method. The in vivo antibacterial activity of the compounds against Escherichia coli was also evaluated by mouse protection test. All the compounds exhibited significant antibacterial and weak antifungal activities. The in vivo antibacterial activity (ED50) against E. coli was 50-160 mg kg(-1) in the order of 7<9<8<10. 1-ethyl-6-fluoro-7-(2,5-dioxo-piperazin-1-yl)1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-quinoline-3-carbox ylic acid (7) was found to exhibit the most potent in vitro antimicrobial activity with MIC of 4.1, 3.1, 3.1, 2.4, 1, 1, 25 and >100 microg mL(-1) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus cereus, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger.
TI  - Hyperatomarin, an antibacterial prenylated phloroglucinol from Hypericumatomarium ssp. degenii.
AB  - As shown by quantitative (1)H NMR measurements, a lipophilic extract of the aerial parts of Hypericum atomarium ssp. degenii contained a high percentage (3.1% per weight of dried plant material) of a prenylated phloroglucinol (1). Compound 1, named hyperatomarin, occurring in two tautomeric forms (1a <==> 1b), was isolated by bioactivity-guided preparative TLC and was identified on the basis of spectral data interpretation. This isolated phloroglucinol exhibited activity against Gram-positive (Staphyloccocus aureus and Microccocus luteus) and Gram-positive spore-forming bacteria (Bacillus subtilis and B. IP 5832).
TI  - Pharmacological and toxicological activity of Heterophyllaea pustulata anthraquinone extracts.
AB  - Benzenic extracts from both stems and leaves of Heterophyllaea pustulata showed the most significant activity in vivo in the Brine Shrimp Lethally Test (BST), relative to others of different polarity. They were therefore selected for in vitro antimicrobial activity studies. Bacteriostatic activity against Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341 was detected, selectively inhibiting both oxacillin-sensitive and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, among several gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial species tested. Antifungal activity against important opportunist microorganisms and against those involved in superficial mycosis, all from nosocomial origin was also detected. A chemical screening revealed the presence of anthraquinones as major compounds. Among them, we identified damnacanthal, rubiadin, 2-hydroxy-3-methyl anthraquinone, soranjidiol, rubiadin-1-methyl ether, and damnacanthol in the benzenic stem extract. The benzenic leaf extract shows a similar chemical composition, except for damnacanthal, damnacanthol, soranjidiol-1-methyl ether, and 3 anthraquinones whose structures have not yet been elucidated. Acute toxicity studies revealed a low toxicity in mice for the anthraquinonic extracts, as measured in the LD50 value (123 mg/kg body wt. i.v.), and death was not observed at doses of up to 4000 mg/kg body wt. s.c.
TI  - Synthesis and biological evaluation of novel leucomycin analogues modified at the C-3 position. I. Epimerization and methylation of the 3-hydroxyl group.
AB  - The synthesis and biological evaluation of sixteen-membered macrolides modified at the C-3 position are described. 3-Epi-leucomycin A7 (9), 3-O-acyl-3-epi-leucomycin A7 analogues (11a-11e), 3-O-acylleucomycin A7 analogues (13b-13e) and 3-O-methylleucomycin analogues (16a, 16b and 22) were synthesized via fully protected intermediates (7, 5a, 5b and 20). After appropriate modification, subsequent deprotections were performed to furnish a variety of leucomycin analogues. Methylation of the 3-hydroxyl group was found to improve the pharmacoprofile of leucomycin antibiotics. 3-O-Methylrokitamycin (16b) showed enhanced antibacterial activity in vitro and 3,3''-di-O-methyl-4''-O-(3-methylbutyl)leucomycin V (22) exhibited improved metabolic stability in rat plasma in vitro.
TI  - Enantiotracin.
AB  - The enantiomer of the antibiotic bacitracin A was prepared by solid-phase total synthesis. ent-Bacitracin A was found to be equally potent to the natural enantiomer in in vitro susceptibility assays. This supports the notion that bacitracin exerts its antibacterial effects through interaction with bactoprenylpyrophosphate, an achiral ligand.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of fused Mannich ketones.
AB  - New Mannich ketones of fused bicyclic ketones as 1-indanones and 1-tetralones were prepared using the classical acid-catalysed Mannich reaction. Known members of this family were used in comparative biological tests. Antibacterial activity of these new water-soluble compounds was reported against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, E. coli ReD31m4, Salmonella minnesota Re595, Shigella sonnei Re4350, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Micrococcus luteus and Bacillus subtilis standard strains. Human cytotoxicity of our new compounds was evaluated against HeLa cell line. Some compounds showed low cytotoxicity (56.738 nM mL(-1) for 24, 47.497 nM mL(-1) for 31 and 48.379 nM mL(-1) for 26) and proved to be efficient antibacterial agents against the Gram-positive and partly against E. coli strains. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) changed in the range of 1.56->200 microg mL(-1). The deep rough mutants showed (generally eight times) higher sensitivity toward the compounds than the smooth E. coli. Hence, the permeability of Gram-negative outer membrane can influence the MIC values of our compounds. A preliminary quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) study indicated the maximum positive charge (MaxQ(+)) as the parameter that most significantly affected antibacterial activity against E. coli. In B. subtilis, the influence of a topological descriptor (first-order valence-connectivity index, XV1) was also revealed; however, other strains did not yield meaningful QSAR with the set of descriptors employed.
TI  - Mode of action of the antimicrobial peptide aureocin A53 from Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - We investigated the mode of action of aureocin A53 on living bacterial cells and  model membranes. Aureocin A53 acted bactericidally against Staphylococcus simulans 22, with >90% of the cells killed within a few minutes. Cell death was followed by lysis, as indicated by a clearing of the cell suspension and Gram staining. Aureocin A53 rapidly dissipated the membrane potential and simultaneously stopped biosynthesis of DNA, polysaccharides, and protein. Aureocin A53 induced a rapid release of preaccumulated glutamate and Rb(+). Experiments on model membranes demonstrated that aureocin A53 provoked significant leakage of carboxyfluorescein (CF) exclusively from acidic liposomes but only at relatively high concentrations (0.5 to 8 mol%). Thus, the bactericidal activity of aureocin A53 derives from membrane permeation via generalized membrane destruction rather than by formation of discrete pores within membranes. Tryptophan emission fluorescence spectroscopy demonstrated interaction of aureocin A53 with both acidic and neutral membranes, as indicated by similar blue shifts. Since there was no significant aureocin A53-induced CF leakage from neutral liposomes, its appears that the peptide does interact with neutral lipids without provoking membrane damage.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity of Aspergillus fumigatus is enhanced by a pool of bacteria.
AB  - In a screening program for new antibiotic producers, a strain of Aspergillus fumigatus was isolated from Brazilian soil samples. A pool of autoclaved bacteria was added to part of the fungus culture on the second day of fermentation to increase antibiotic production. The chloroform extract from the culture broth to which the pool of autoclaved bacteria was added showed an increase of 55%, 63% and more than 100% in activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans and Micrococcus luteus, respectively. Also, the HPLC chromatographic profiles of the chloroform extracts from both culture conditions were different. Two active compounds were isolated from the broth of the culture grown in the presence of pooled bacteria and were identified as 3,4-dimethoxyphenol and 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene.
TI  - Active substances against trypomastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi and microorganisms are produced in sequence by Talaromyces flavus.
AB  - The conditions for the sequential production of antibiotic activity by Talaromyces flavus were determined. The highest level of activity against Trypanosoma cruzi was obtained from the aqueous extract of the Czapeck's fermentative culture after 48 hours, with lysis of 97.58% of the trypomastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi (red blood cells remained normal). The antimicrobial activity was detected in the extracts of fermentative cultures from different media just after 144 hours of incubation. Maximum activities against Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans were present in chloroform, butanolic and water extracts, in this order, when Talaromyces flavus was cultivated at pH 5.0. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of extracts of Takeuchi's cultures were determined.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of licorice flavonoids against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Nineteen flavonoids isolated from licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra, G. inflata and G. uralensis) were tested for their antimicrobial activities against methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - [New antifungal antibiotics, bacillopeptins and fusaricidins].
AB  - We isolated four strains of bacteria producing antifungal antibiotics from the rhizosphere of garlic with basal rot caused by the plant pathogenic fungal strain Fusarium oxysporum. Among them, Bacillus subtilis FR-2 was found to produce new antifungal antibiotics, named bacillopeptins A, B, and C. Their structures have been determined by 1D and 2D NMR and MS experiments, and amino acid analysis coupled with chiral HPLC, to be cyclic lipopeptides each containing a long-chain beta-amino acid. Another bacterial strain, Bacillus polymyxa KT-8, was shown to produce new antifungal antibiotics named fusaricidins A, B, C, and D which are more potent than bacillopeptins in their antimicrobial activity. The structures of the fusaricidins have been elucidated similarly as bacillopeptins to be cyclic hexadepsipeptides all containing 15-guanidino-3-hydroxypentadecanoic acid as a side chain. Fusaricidins strongly inhibit the growth of various kinds of fungi and moreover surprisingly show strong inhibitory activity against Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus or Micrococcus luteus.
TI  - Chemical constituents and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Lantana  xenica.
AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the chemical composition of Lantana xenica essential oil and its antimicrobial activity. The oil from the aerial parts of Lantana xenica Mold. (Verbenacea) was obtained by steam distillation and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The major constituent of the oil was (E)-caryophyllene (35.2 %), with minor amounts of gamma-cadinene (13.3 %), alpha-pinene (9.3 %), ocimene (9.2 %) and germacrene D (6.6 %). The antimicrobial assays showed that the essential oil of L. xenica inhibited the growth of Bacillus cereus and Proteus mirabilis and both bacteria were inhibited by (E)-caryophyllene, the major component of the oil. Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. aureus showed a lower inhibition. The bacteria Micrococcus luteus, Klebsiella sp., Escherichia coli and the yeast Candida albicans were insensitive to both the oil and (E)-caryophyllene.
TI  - The antibacterial activity of topical retinoids: the case of retinaldehyde.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Retinoids such as retinoic acid (RA), retinol (ROL) and retinaldehyde (RAL) are currently used in many formulations and indications ranging form acne to skin aging. Most if not all their pharmacological activities occur through binding to nuclear receptors with subsequent modulation of the activities of several genes. Little attention has been given to the many other potential actions on the surface of the skin. AIM: To analyse the potential anti-infective activities of topical ROL, RAL and RA. METHODS: Microbial minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of ROL, RAL and RA were determined by a microdilution method on reference strains including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus flavus, Propionibacterium acnes, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus hominis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and 133 clinical strains including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Streptococcus group B, Enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis, vancomycin-resistant E. faecium and Pseudomonas/Klebsiella. In two clinical trials in healthy human volunteers, skin bacterial densities were evaluated in samples obtained with the cylinder scrub method: (1). 2 and 5 h after a single application of 0.05% RAL or vehicle on the forearm and (2). in a single-blind randomized study where 0.05% RAL or vehicle were applied daily for 2 weeks on the forehead of 22 volunteers. Paired results from treated (or vehicle) and untreated areas were analysed. RESULTS: Of the three retinoids tested, only RAL showed a significant in vitro antibacterial activity; this activity was found against reference strains of gram-positive bacteria like S. aeureus, Micrococcus spp. or P. acnes. No activity was found against gram-negative bacteria. These results on reference strains were confirmed on 133 clinical isolates. MIC(50) and MIC(90) values for RAL were 8 and 16 mg/l, respectively, for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus and 4 and 8 mg/l for methicillin-resistant S. aureus. The two in vivo studies showed that areas treated with RAL had a significant decrease in the bacterial counts. In the forehead study, the median decrease was 10(2) log/cm(2) for P. acnes and 10(1.8) log/cm(2) for staphylococci. No resistant bacteria were found after 2 weeks of topical use. Preliminary results suggest that the antibacterial effect of RAL is due, in part, to the aldehyde group in the lateral chain, since non-retinoid pseudo-analogues of the chain, like citral and hexenal, showed a similar antibacterial activity. CONCLUSION: We have shown that RAL differs from parent natural retinoids such as ROL and RA in demonstrating significant antibacterial activities upon topical use. This activity is likely due to the aldehyde group in the isoprenoic lateral chain, which illustrates the potential bifunctional properties of some retinoids.
TI  - The activity of p-methoxybenzylisothiocyanate against Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus ducreyi, and other microorganisms.
AB  - p-Methoxybenzylisothiocyanate was isolated from Lepidium bonariense and found to  be responsible for the plants antimicrobial and STD activity. MIC determinations were conducted for p-methoxybenzylisothiocyanate on Haemophilus ducreyi, Neisseria gonorrheae, Candida albicans, Bacillus subtilus, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter sp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Psuedomanas aeruginosa. An in vitro cellular toxicity assay showed that at 100 microM (17,9 microg/mL) p-methoxybenzylisothiocyanate is not toxic to living cells.
TI  - Bioactive abietane and seco-abietane diterpenoids from Salvia prionitis.
AB  - From the roots of Salvia prionitis a new tricyclic diterpene, saprirearine (1), a new anhydride-type compound, saprionide (2), a new 7,8-seco-abietane diterpene derivative, 7,8-seco-para-ferruginone (3), and two new 4,5-seco-5,10-friedo-abietane diterpenoids, 4-hydroxysaprorthoquinone (4) and 3-keto-4-hydroxysaprorthoquinone (5), were isolated. Their structures were established by spectroscopic methods and chemical transformation. Compound 3 showed antimicrobial activities against two Gram-positive organisms, Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus, with MIC values of 20.0 and 15.0 microM, respectively. Compound 4 showed significant inhibition against topoisomerase Iota with an IC50 value of 0.8 microM. Compound 5 exhibited cytotoxic activities against HL-60 human leukemia and the SGC-7901 and MKN-28 stomach cancer cell lines, with IC50 values of 4.6, 0.2, and 0.3 microM, respectively.
TI  - Antimicrobial studies on three species of Hypericum from the Canary Islands.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of several extracts and fractions of the aerial parts  of Hypericum canariense, Hypericum glandulosum and Hypericum grandifolium was investigated using the disc diffusion and broth microdilution methods against twelve reference microorganisms (eight bacterial and four fungal strains). The methanol extract and chloroform fraction of H. canariense, as well as the methanol extracts, butanol and chloroform fractions of both H. glandulosum and H. grandifolium exhibited a good antibacterial activity against four Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus var. mycoides, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and the Gram-negative bacterium Bordetella bronchiseptica with the diameters of growth inhibition area in the range 10-25 mm and MICs values between 0.03 and 0.29 mg/ml. Neither the infusions and aqueous fractions of the species studied nor the butanol fraction of H. canariense showed any antibacterial activity against the tested microorganisms. Amongst the active extracts, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination showed that the H. canariense chloroform fraction was the most active against M. luteus, S. aureus and S. epidermidis. No antifungal activity was seen with any of the extracts or fractions tested. The results of this study support the use of these species in Canarian traditional medicine to treat skin infections.
TI  - Radamycin, a novel thiopeptide produced by streptomyces sp. RSP9. I. Taxonomy, fermentation, isolation and biological activities.
AB  - The newly isolated strain Streptomyces sp. RSP9 produces two thiopeptides; one of them is methylsulfomycin I, which shows potent antibiotic activity against several gram-positive bacteria such as Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus aureus. The other is a new thiopeptide named radamycin. In the present work, this compound was purified and tested against several microorganisms and no antibiotic activity was detected in the assays. However, it does have a very strong capacity as an inducer of the tipA promoter, and indeed is the first reported molecule with tipA promoter induction capacity without detectable antibiotic activity. Induction of the tipA promoter also occurs with methylsulfomycin I.
TI  - Essential oil constituents and in vitro antimicrobial activity of Decalepis hamiltonii roots against foodborne pathogens.
AB  - Hydrodistillation of Decalepis hamiltonii roots yielded an essential oil (0.33% v/w) that contained 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde (37.45%), 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (31.01%), 4-O-methylresorcylaldehyde (9.12%), benzyl alcohol (3.16%), and alpha-atlantone (2.06%) as major constituents, with aromatic aldehydes constituting the main fraction of this root's essential oil. The oil was tested for its antimicrobial activity against foodborne pathogens responsible for food spoilage and human pathologies using standard antimicrobial assays. It exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus, Bacillus megaterium, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Micrococcus roseus, and Staphylococcus aureus at a concentration range of 1:0 with inhibitory activities of 27, 23, 16, 19, 22, 19, and 23 mm, respectively, which are comparable to those of the standards. The roots of D. hamiltonii, therefore, may be considered as an inexpensive source of an essential oil rich in antimicrobial compounds against foodborne pathogens.
TI  - Isolation of a novel cyclic hexadepsipeptide pipalamycin from Streptomyces as an  apoptosis-inducing agent.
AB  - The novel cyclic hexadepsipeptide named pipalamycin was isolated from a culture filtrate of Streptomyces sp. ML297-90F8 as an apoptosis-inducing agent. The antibiotic was found to be consisting of each one mole of alanine, N-hydroxyalanine, glycine, N-acylated 3-hydroxyleucine, and two moles of piperazic acid. Pipalamycin induced apoptosis in apoptosis-resistant human pancreatic adenocarcinoma AsPC-1 cells at 0.3 microg/ml in 24 to approximately 48 hours. It also showed antibacterial activity on Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus. Fermentation, isolation, structural elucidation and the biological activities of pipalamycin are described.
TI  - Correlation of the antibacterial activities of cationic peptide antibiotics and cationic steroid antibiotics.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of cationic steroid antibiotics and cationic peptide antibiotics have been compared. Depolarization of bacterial membranes, activation of bacterial stress-related gene promoters, and changes in bacterial morphologies caused by these antibiotics suggest that cationic steroid and peptide antibiotics share mechanistic aspects. Modified cationic steroid antibiotics display improved selectivity for prokaryotic cells over eukaryotic cells presumably due to increased charge recognition.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of a castor oil-based irrigant.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of irrigating solutions--Endoquil (castor oil detergent), 2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution, and 0.5% NaOCl solution-was evaluated against gram-positive cocci (Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus sobrinus), gram-negative rods (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and the yeast Candida albicans. Activity was evaluated using the two-layer agar diffusion technique. The base layer was obtained by pouring 10.0 ml of Muller Hinton Medium or 10.0 ml of Brain Heart Infusion agar in a Petri dish. After solidification a 5.0 ml seed layer of Muller Hinton Medium or Brain Heart Infusion agar with inoculum (106/ml) was added. Absorbent paper disks (6.0 mm in diameter) immersed in the solutions were placed at equidistant points. Plates were maintained at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion of the solutions and incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. The candle jar system was used for the Brain Heart Infusion agar plates. All tests were performed in duplicate. After incubation the medium was optimized with 0.05 g% triphenyltetrazolium chlorate gel and inhibition halos were measured. All bacterial strains were inhibited by 2.0% chlorhexidine gluconate. Endoquil was effective against gram-positive microorganisms, and 0.5% NaOCl was effective only against S. aureus.
TI  - The antibacterial properties of secreted phospholipases A2: a major physiological role for the group IIA enzyme that depends on the very high pI of the enzyme to allow penetration of the bacterial cell wall.
AB  - The antibacterial properties of human group IIA secreted phospholipase A(2) against Gram-positive bacteria as a result of membrane hydrolysis have been reported. Using Micrococcus luteus as a model system, we demonstrate the very high specificity of this human enzyme for such hydrolysis compared with the group IB, IIE, IIF, V, and X human secreted phospholipase A(2)s. A unique feature of the group IIA enzyme is its very high pI due to a large excess of cationic residues on the enzyme surface. The importance of this global positive charge in bacterial cell membrane hydrolysis and bacterial killing has been examined using charge reversal mutagenesis. The global positive charge on the enzyme surface allows penetration through the bacterial cell wall, thus allowing access of this enzyme to the cell membrane. Reduced bacterial killing was associated with the loss of positive charge and reduced cell membrane hydrolysis. All mutants were highly effective in hydrolyzing the bacterial membrane of cells in which the cell wall was permeabilized with lysozyme. These same overall characteristics were also seen with suspensions of Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria innocua, where cell membrane hydrolysis and antibacterial activity of human group IIA enzyme was also lost as a result of charge reversal mutagenesis.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial study of unsaturated Mannich ketones.
AB  - Several Mannich ketones of 2-arylmethylenecycloalkanones were synthesised using the classical acid-catalysed Mannich reaction. Antibacterial activity of these new water-soluble compounds was reported against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Micrococcus luteus and Bacillus subtilis standard strains. Human cell line cytotoxicity of our new compounds was evaluated against HeLa cell lines. Some compounds showed low cytotoxicity (41.52 nM mL(-1) for 14 and 46.60 nM mL(-1) for 18) and proved to be efficient antibacterial agents against the Gram-positive strains. Minimum inhibitory concentrations varied from 1.56 to 100 microg mL(-1). The mechanism of action was examined, too.
TI  - Dicynthaurin: an antimicrobial peptide from hemocytes of the solitary tunicate, Halocynthia aurantium.
AB  - We isolated a novel antimicrobial peptide, dicynthaurin, from hemocytes of a tunicate, Halocynthia aurantium. The native peptide had a mass of approximately 6.2 kDa and was composed of two 30-residue monomers without sequence homology to any previously identified peptides (ILQKAVLDCLKAAGSSLSKAAITAIYNKIT). Most cynthaurin molecules were C-terminally amidated and were linked covalently by a single cystine disulfide bond. When performed in membrane-mimetic environments, circular dichroism studies of dicynthaurin revealed largely alpha-helical conformations. Dicynthaurin's broad-spectrum activity encompassed Gram-positive (Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa), but not Candida albicans, a fungus. Although dicynthaurin was purified from a marine invertebrate, its antimicrobial activity was optimal at NaCl concentrations below 100 mM. This suggests that the antimicrobial actions of this molecule may take place intracellularly (e.g., within a phagosome) rather than extracellularly.
TI  - Benzopyran derivatives from Mallotus apelta.
AB  - From the leaves of Mallotus apelta, seven benzopyran compounds were obtained and  their structures were determined using spectroscopic methods. One showed moderate antibiotic activity against Micrococcus lutens.
TI  - Phorbasin B and C: novel diterpenes from a southern Australian marine sponge, Phorbas species.
AB  - A southern Australian Phorbas sp. has yielded the novel diterpenes phorbasin B (2) and phorbasin C (3). Phorbasins B and C possess a hitherto unknown carbon skeleton, and their structures were assigned on the basis of detailed spectroscopic analyses.
TI  - Inactivation of chloramphenicol by Staphylococcus aureus biotype C from humans &  animals.
AB  - During an investigation, 55 biotype C (bovine and caprine biotype) Staphylococcus aureus isolated from 43 cows suffering from mastitis, and 20 biotype C Staph. aureus strains from the nares and the side of nail-tips of the right thumbs of 20 farm workers (milkers and animal attendants) on six small dairy farms in Assam and Meghalaya were isolated. Three strains from the former and six strains from the latter from among the isolates on two of the farms were found resistant to chloramphenicol, when tested with a routine susceptibility test. Test of the organisms by the agar dilution method indicated that the resistant strains had a minimal inhibitory concentration for chloramphenicol of 32 micrograms/ml or more, while, the chloramphenicol sensitive strains and two reference strains, Staph. aureus ATCC 25923 and Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341, had < or = 8 micrograms/ml. Two bovine and five human chloramphenicol resistant strains showed positive results when tested by the Gots test. When these strains were tested by a standard method in broth, containing 30 micrograms chloramphenicol per ml, all showed evidence of inactivating chloramphenicol up to a non-detectable level within 36 h. Inactivation of chloramphenicol by Staph. aureus has clinical significance.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of antimicrobial activity of sealers and pastes used in endodontics.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of four root canal sealers (AH Plus, Sealapex, Ketac Endo, and Fill Canal), two calcium hydroxide pastes (Calen and Calasept), and a zinc oxide paste was evaluated. Seven bacterial strains were used, six of them standard; Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 10541. There was a wild strain of Streptococcus mutans isolated from saliva obtained in an adult dental clinic. Activity was evaluated using the agar diffusion method with Brain Heart Infusion agar and Muller Hinton medium seeded by pour plate. Calcium hydroxide-based sealers and pastes were either placed directly into 4.0 x 4.0 mm wells or by using absorbent paper points. The plates were kept at room temperature for 2 hr for diffusion. After incubation at 37 degrees C for 24 hr, the medium was optimized with 0.05 g% TTC gel and inhibition haloes were measured. All bacterial strains were inhibited by all materials using the well method. However, when the materials were applied with absorbent paper points, Enterococcus faecalis was not inhibited by zinc oxide, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was not inhibited by AH Plus, Fill Canal, and the zinc oxide-based paste. We conclude that sealers and pastes presented antimicrobial activity in vitro and culture medium optimization with 0.05 g% TTC gel facilitated observation of the inhibition haloes.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activities of some 3-arylamino-5-[2-(substituted 1-imidazolyl)ethyl]-1,2,4-triazole derivatives.
AB  - In this study, some 3-arylamino-5-[2-(substituted imidazol-1-yl or benzimidazol-1-yl)ethyl]-1,2,4-triazole derivatives were synthesised by reacting 3-(substituted imidazol-1-yl)propionyl hydrazides, with S-methyl-N'-arylisothiouronium iodide salts. Their structures were elucidated by IR, 1H-NMR and mass spectroscopic data and elemental analyses results. Antimicrobial activities of the compounds were observed against Staphylococcus aureus NRRL B-767, Micrococcus luteus NRRL B-4375, Escherichia coli B, Pseudomonas aeroginosa NRRL B-23 and the fungi Candida albicans and Candida glabrata by using the tube dilution technique. Remarkable activity was obtained.
TI  - Evaluation of the antibacterial and hemolytic activities of Latvian herbal preparation.
AB  - Three extracts originating from a combination of various Latvian plant species were tested for their antibacterial activities by evaluating growth delays using a fully automated microturbidimetric method. Ten different human and bovine strains of the genera Staphylococcus and Micrococcus were used as test microorganisms. The inhibitory effect in vitro was defined as the difference between the growth rate without herbs and the growth rate in the presence of an extract. Among the tested strains, Staphylococcus aureus was found sensitive to all 3 extracts. However, extract I was the most effective in slowing the growth of all strains tested. Using appropriate tester strains it should be possible to set up a broad-range microtubidimetry assay for individual herb screening in vitro. The hemolytic effects of the individual extracts on human erythrocytes were also studied at different concentrations. Two of the herbal extracts had minimal lytic effects on eurocaryotic cells. An additional hemolysis test was conducted in the presence of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) as a free radical scavenger: CoQ10 had no effect on the hemolytic reaction.
TI  - The presence of antibacterial and opioid peptides in human plasma during coronary artery bypass surgery.
AB  - Antibacterial peptides, found in both invertebrates and vertebrates, represent a  potential innate defense mechanism against microbial infections. However, it is unknown whether this process occurs in humans during surgery. We looked for evidence of release of antibacterial peptides during coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). We used immunological techniques and antibacterial assays combined with high-performance gel-permeation chromatography, reverse-phase HPLC, N-terminal sequencing and comparison with synthetic standards to characterize the peptide B/enkelytin. We show the presence of anionic antibacterial peptide, the peptide B/enkelytin which correspond to the C-terminal part of proenkephalin A, from the plasma of patients undergoing CABG. Our studies show that peptide B/enkelytin is initially present at low levels in plasma and is then released in increased amounts just after skin incision. Antibacterial assays confirmed that the peptides specifically target gram-positive bacteria. We also demonstrate that peptide B/enkelytin is metabolized in vivo to the opioid peptides methionine-enkephalin-Arg-Phe and methionine-enkephalin, peptides that we show have granulocyte chemotactic activity. These findings suggest that in humans, surgical incision leads to the release of antibacterial peptides. Furthermore, these antibacterial peptides can be metabolized into compounds that have immune-activating properties.
TI  - Overexpression, purification, and characterization of Bacillus subtilis N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase CwlC.
AB  - N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase CwlC of Bacillus subtilis was overproduced in  Escherichia coli and purified 21-fold. The amidase hydrolyzed type A cell walls such as B. subtilis. The amidase bound slightly to the Microbacterium lacticum cell wall (type B), but did not entirely hydrolyze it. The presence of calcium or magnesium ion increased the resistance of the amidase to heat denaturation.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of 9-O-acyl- and 9-O-benzoyl-substituted berberrubines.
AB  - In the course of a structure-activity relationship study on berberrubine derivatives, a series of compounds bearing 9-O-acyl-(4-6) and 9-O-benzoyl- (7) substituents was synthesized with the expectation of increasing the antimicrobial activity. One of the berberrubine derivatives, 9-lauroylberberrubine chloride was the most active against Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis as well as the Gram-negative bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae in comparison to berberine, the currently used antibiotic in clinic. This result suggested that the presence of lipophilic substituents of certain structures and sizes might be crucial for the optimal antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of essential oils and ethanol extract of Phlomis fruticosa L. (Lamiaceae).
AB  - The essential oils and an ethanol extract of Phlomis fruticosa L. were evaluated  for antibacterial and antifungal activities. Seven bacterial and seven fungal species were used. Among them were human, animal and plant pathogens, food poisoning bacteria and fungi which are known as potential mycotoxin producers. The essential oils showed antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Micrococcus luteus. The essential oils extracted from the plants collected from two different localities showed similar antibacterial activities. The antifungal activity of the essential oils was positive against Aspergillus niger, A. ochraceus, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Fusarium tricinctum and Phomopsis helianthi. The ethanol extract showed antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis and antifungal activity against Aspergillus niger, A. ochraceus, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Fusarium tricinctum and Phomopsis helianthi.
TI  - Antimicrobial effects of Finnish plant extracts containing flavonoids and other phenolic compounds.
AB  - Plant phenolics, especially dietary flavonoids, are currently of growing interest owing to their supposed functional properties in promoting human health. Antimicrobial screening of 13 phenolic substances and 29 extracts prepared from Finnish plant materials against selected microbes was conducted in this study. The tests were carried out using diffusion methods with four to nine microbial species (Aspergillus niger, Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis). Flavone, quercetin and naringenin were effective in inhibiting the growth of the organisms. The most active plant extracts were purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria L.) against Candida albicans, meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria (L.) Maxim.), willow herb (Epilobium angustifolium L.), cloudberry (Rubus chamaemorus L.) and raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) against bacteria, and white birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.), pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and potato (Solanum tuberosum. L.) against gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Protective effects of alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene on para-nonylphenol-induced inhibition of cell growth, cellular respiration and glucose-induced proton extrusion of bacteria.
AB  - para-Nonylphenol (NP) showed a dose-dependent inhibition against the cell growth  of Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus at 5-100 microM. However, other typical plastic-derived endocrine disruptors such as bisphenol A and di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) did not significantly affect the cell growth of these bacteria at 5-100 microM. The NP-induced cell growth inhibition was restored when concomitantly supplemented with lipophilic antioxidants such as alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene, but not with hydrophilic antioxidants, ascorbic acid and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). NP also suppressed in a dose-dependent manner cellular oxygen consumption and glucose-induced proton extrusion of these bacteria at 10-100 microM. Both effects were prevented when added with alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene, but not with ascorbic acid and EGCG. The significance of these results is discussed from the viewpoint of environmental microbiology and a possible biochemical mechanism of the inhibitory effect of NP is suggested.
TI  - Purification, characterization, and primary structure of a novel cell wall hydrolytic amidase, CwhA, from Achromobacter lyticus.
AB  - A novel bacteriolytic enzyme CwhA (cell wall hydrolytic amidase) was purified by  ion exchange and gel-filtration chromatographies from a commercial bacteriolytic preparation from Achromobacter lyticus. CwhA exhibited optimal pH at 8.5 and lysed CHCl(3)-treated Escherichia coli more efficiently than Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Pediococcus acidilactici. The enzyme was inhibited by 1,10-phenanthroline strongly and by EDTA to a lesser extent, suggesting that it is probably a metalloenzyme. Amino acid composition and mass spectrometric analyses for the CwhA-derived M. luteus muropeptides revealed that CwhA is N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase [EC 3.5.1. 28]. The complete amino acid sequence of CwhA was established by a combination of Edman degradation and mass spectrometry for peptides obtained by Achromobacter protease I (API) digestion and cyanogen bromide (CNBr) cleavage. The enzyme consists of a single polypeptide chain of 177 amino acid residues with one disulfide bond, Cys114-Cys121. CwhA was found to be homologous to N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase from bacteriophage T7 (BPT7). Its sequence identity with BPT7 is 35%, but the amino acid residues functioning as zinc ligands in BPT7 are absent in CwhA. These results suggest that CwhA is a new type of N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase.
TI  - Design and synthesis of novel antimicrobial pseudopeptides with selective membrane-perturbation activity.
AB  - By incorporating carbamate bond(s) into a cytolytic peptide, novel pseudopeptides with potent antibacterial activity and low hemolytic activity were synthesized. Circular dichroism spectra suggested that the incorporation of carbamate bond(s) decrease the alpha helical conformation of the peptide in lipid membrane circumstances, which must be regarded as a major factor for the separation of antibacterial activity from cytotoxic activity for mammalian cell. Experiments in which dye was released from vesicles indicated that the potent antibacterial activity and low hemolytic activity of the pseudopeptides must be due to their great lipid membrane selectivity. The present result suggest that backbone modifications can be a great tool for developing pseudopeptides with improved biological activity and bioavailability from cytolytic peptides.
TI  - Production of bacteriocin-like metabolites by lactic acid cultures isolated from  sucuk samples.
AB  - A total of 51 sucuk samples, obtained from different regions of Turkey, were examined for lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains producing putative bacteriocin-like metabolites. For detection of antagonistic activity, agar spot and well diffusion assay tests were used. Lactobacillus sake Lb790, Listeria monocytogenes Li6, Staphylococcus aureus St44 and Escherichia coli NRRL B-3704 were used as indicator organisms. Strains having antimicrobial activity were also tested against Clostridium perfringens 4TTK, Clostridium botulinum type A. 7948, Bacillus cereus NRRL B-3711, Micrococcus luteus NRRL B-4376 and Yersinia enterocolitica type 103. 57 of 424 isolates from sucuk samples were putative producers of bacteriocin-like metabolistes and were identified as the following: 19 Lactobacillus plantarum, 4 L. curvatus, 4 Pediococcus pentosaceus, 3 P. acidilactici, 2 L. pentosus, 2 L. sake, 1 L. delbrueckii, 1 L. rhamnosus and 21 unidentified Lactobacillus spp. P. pentosaceus 416, P. acidilactici 413, 419 and 446, L. curvatus 348, L. plantarum 452 and 495, and Lactobacillus spp. 411 strains have the best potential for use as sucuk starter cultures.
TI  - Bacterial cell membrane hydrolysis by secreted phospholipases A(2): a major physiological role of human group IIa sPLA(2) involving both bacterial cell wall penetration and interfacial catalysis.
AB  - The ability of human group IIa secreted phospholipase A(2) (human sPLA(2)) to hydrolyse the phospholipid membrane of whole cell suspensions of Gram-positive bacteria is demonstrated in real time using a continuous fluorescence displacement assay. Micrococcus luteus is used as a model system and demonstrates an almost absolute specificity for this human enzyme compared with porcine pancreatic and Naja naja venom sPLA(2)s. This specificity is due to selective penetration of the highly cationic human sPLA(2)50%) phospholipid hydrolysis was observed and this was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry that allowed the identification of several molecular species of phosphatidylglycerol as the targets for hydrolysis. However, the bactericidal activity of the human enzyme under these assay conditions was low, highlighting the capacity of the organism to survive a major phospholipid insult. In addition to pure enzyme, the human sPLA(2) activity in tears was demonstrated using M. luteus as substrate. In comparison to M. luteus, cell suspensions of Staphylococcus aureus were highly resistant to hydrolysis by human sPLA(2) as well as to the pancreatic and venom enzymes. Treatment of this organism with the specific cell wall protease lysostaphin resulted in a dramatic enhancement in cell membrane phospholipid hydrolysis by all three sPLA(2)s. Overall, the results highlight the potential of the human sPLA(2) as a selective antimicrobial agent against Gram-positive bacteria in vivo because this enzyme is essentially inactive against mammalian plasma membranes. However, the enzyme will be most effective in combination with other antimicrobial agents that enhance the permeability of the bacterial cell wall and where potentiation of the effectiveness of other antibiotics would be expected.
TI  - Multiparameter flow cytometric analysis of antibiotic effects on membrane potential, membrane permeability, and bacterial counts of Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus.
AB  - Although flow cytometry has been used to study antibiotic effects on bacterial membrane potential (MP) and membrane permeability, flow cytometric results are not always well correlated to changes in bacterial counts. Using new, precise techniques, we simultaneously measured MP, membrane permeability, and particle counts of antibiotic-treated and untreated Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus cells. MP was calculated from the ratio of red and green fluorescence of diethyloxacarbocyanine [DiOC(2)(3)]. A normalized permeability parameter was calculated from the ratio of far red fluorescence of the nucleic acid dye TO-PRO-3 and green DiOC(2)(3) fluorescence. Bacterial counts were calculated by the addition of polystyrene beads to the sample at a known concentration. Amoxicillin increased permeability within 45 min. At concentrations of <1 microg/ml, some organisms showed increased permeability but normal MP; this population disappeared after 4 h, while bacterial counts increased. At amoxicillin concentrations above 1 microg/ml, MP decreased irreversibly and the particle counts did not increase. Tetracycline and erythromycin caused smaller, dose- and time-dependent decreases in MP. Tetracycline concentrations of <1 microg/ml did not change permeability, while a tetracycline concentration of 4 microg/ml permeabilized 50% of the bacteria; 4 microg of erythromycin per ml permeabilized 20% of the bacteria. Streptomycin decreased MP substantially, with no effect on permeability; chloramphenicol did not change either permeability or MP. Erythromycin pretreatment of bacteria prevented streptomycin and amoxicillin effects. Flow cytometry provides a sensitive means of monitoring the dynamic cellular events that occur in bacteria exposed to antibacterial agents; however, it is probably simplistic to expect that changes in a single cellular parameter will suffice to determine the sensitivities of all species to all drugs.
TI  - Stresgenin B, an inhibitor of heat-induced heat shock protein gene expression, produced by Streptomyces sp. AS-9.
AB  - Stresgenin B was isolated as an inhibitor of heat-induced heat shock protein (HSP) gene expression from a culture broth of Streptomyces sp. AS-9 by silica gel chromatography and HPLC. The molecular formula of the novel compound was determined as C11H13NO5 by high resolution FAB-MS analysis, and the structure was determined by UV, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, HMQC, HMBC, and NOESY spectra. Stresgenin B inhibited heat-induced luciferase reporter-gene expression directed by the human hsp70B promoter in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells at concentrations lower than the concentrations for inhibition of dexamethasone-induced luciferase reporter-gene expression directed by the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-LTR promoter. The inhibition of heat-induced reporter gene expression was evident even when cells were exposed to stresgenin B only during heat stress treatment. Moreover, the compound inhibited heat-induced syntheses of hsp72/73, hsp90, and hsp110 and thereby suppressed the induction of thermotolerance. Stresgenin B showed moderate cytotoxic activities against several neoplastic cell lines and also showed antibacterial activities against Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus strains.
TI  - Purification and partial characterization of a murein hydrolase, millericin B, produced by Streptococcus milleri NMSCC 061.
AB  - Streptococcus milleri NMSCC 061 was screened for antimicrobial substances and shown to produce a bacteriolytic cell wall hydrolase, termed millericin B. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity by a four-step purification procedure that consisted of ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by gel filtration, ultrafiltration, and ion-exchange chromatography. The yield following ion-exchange chromatography was 6.4%, with a greater-than-2,000-fold increase in specific activity. The molecular weight of the enzyme was 28,924 as determined by electrospray mass spectrometry. The amino acid sequences of both the N terminus of the enzyme (NH(2) SENDFSLAMVSN) and an internal fragment which was generated by cyanogen bromide cleavage (NH(2) SIQTNAPWGL) were determined by automated Edman degradation. Millericin B displayed a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive bacteria but was not active against Bacillus subtilis W23 or Escherichia coli ATCC 486 or against the producer strain itself. N-Dinitrophenyl derivatization and hydrazine hydrolysis of free amino and free carboxyl groups liberated from peptidoglycan digested with millericin B followed by thin-layer chromatography showed millericin B to be an endopeptidase with multiple activities. It cleaves the stem peptide at the N terminus of glutamic acid as well as the N terminus of the last residue in the interpeptide cross-link of susceptible strains.
TI  - Synthesis of pyrazolidinone antibacterial agents.
AB  - The synthesis of monocyclic pyrazolidinones, which show moderate antibacterial activity, are described.
TI  - Formation and structure of mixed bacterial communities.
AB  - Mixed bacterial communities are formed by unrelated bacteria on solid media. Mixed bacterial communities on solid media are similar to "classical" colonies and are formed after the growth of a large number of unrelated bacteria simultaneously plated onto a limited area of agar. The morphology of the mixed bacterial communities was similar for different combinations of bacteria and did not change when the bacteria were plated on different media. Different bacterial strains form zones of individual and mixed growth in the structure of mixed bacterial communities. The results of electron microscopic examination indicate that mixed bacterial communities are isolated from their external environment by a surface film. The basic part of this film is formed by an elementary membrane. The membrane of the surface film of mixed bacterial communities is a stable structure occupying a large surface area. The results of this investigation seem to indicate the existence of a special type of co-operation between different species of bacteria. This type of co-operation may be very important in the regulation of interactions between different bacteria and between bacteria and the environment.
TI  - The essential oil of Senecio graveolens (Compositae): chemical composition and antimicrobial activity tests.
AB  - The chemical composition of the essential oil obtained from Senecio graveolens (Compositae) was analyzed by GLC-MS and the components identified were: isovaleraldehyde, alpha-pinene, alpha-phellandrene, alpha-terpinene, p-cymene, sabinene, gamma-terpinene, 1-methyl-4-isopropenylbenzene, terpinolene, terpinen-4-ol, piperitenone, alpha- and beta-eudesmol. The investigation by the agar-well diffusion method of the antimicrobial activity of the essential oil proved that it has antibacterial effects on Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341, oxacillin-sensitive and oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, as well as antifungal effects on clinically isolated Candida albicans. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for M. luteus, oxacillin-sensitive S. aureus and C. albicans were 8.73, 10.91 and 2.13 x 10(-2) mg/ml, respectively. The antimicrobial activity related to known antibiotics was calculated. These results would be compatible with a potential concentration-dependent selectivity of antifungal effect of S. graveolens essential oil. Minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) is above 87.3 mg/ml. Thus the MBC:MIC ratio would be clearly higher than 1 (above 8), indicating a bacteriostatic effect of the essential oil.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Byrsonima crassifolia (L.) H.B.K.
AB  - From Byrsonima crassifolia (L.) H.B.K. a tropical tree widely distributed in Mexico, Central and South America, which has been used medicinally since prehispanic times, we report here the antibacterial activities of organic extracts of roots and stems. The ethyl acetate of roots was the most active against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epididermis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Micrococcus luteus.
TI  - [Bactericidal properties of copper (II) complexes with 1-alkylimidazole].
AB  - The copper(II) complexes with 1-alkylimidazole were prepared. Bactericidal properties of the obtained complexes against Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied. Particularly high activity against microbial strains was shown by complex [Cu(1-C4H9Im)4(CIO4)2].
TI  - Macromolecular antimicrobial glycoprotein, achacin, expressed in a methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris.
AB  - A cDNA encoding achacin, an antimicrobial glycoprotein from the body surface mucus of giant African snail Achacina fulica Ferussac, was expressed in a methylotrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris, and recombinant achacin (rAch) was secreted in yeast minimal medium in a polyglycosylated form with 80 kDa. Carbohydrate analysis revealed that the glycosylated moiety of rAch was composed of 50 mol mannose and 2 mol N-acetylglucosamine residues. Antimicrobial activity using Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus showed that the rAch had a behavior similar to its native counterpart. The rAch showed so wide an antimicrobial spectrum that 0.1 mg/ml rAch inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas fluorescens, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus faecalis in addition to E. coli and S. aureus, whereas it did not appreciably affect the growth of Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus cereus and Micrococcus luteus. The rAch was also effective in preventing growth of Vibrio anguillarum and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. The results suggested that the rAch had great potential of using as an antimicrobial agent.
TI  - Identification and semiquantitative estimation of antibiotics added to complete feeds, premixes, and concentrates.
AB  - Classical microbiological methods for determining antimicrobial compounds in feeds are nonspecific. Thus, there is a need to identify biological activity, and bioautography is used for this purpose. A routine method for detecting the following antimicrobial substances in feeds is described: avilamycin, avoparcin, Zn-bacitracin, erythromycin, flavomycin, furazolidone, lasalocid, monensin, narasin, penicillin, salinomycin, spiramycin, tetracyclines, tylosin, and virginiamycin. Carbadox can be detected by UV light examination of the plates prior to bioautography. Semiquantitative estimations of antibiotic content are compared with quantitative determinations of the above mentioned substances in feeds, except erythromycin, penicillin, and tetracyclines. Detection limits range from 0.1 mg/kg (chlortetracycline) to 20 mg/kg (lasalocid). The method involves agar diffusion of buffered samples, a neutral extraction of polyether antibiotics followed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC), and an acid extraction for other antibiotics followed by TLC. Five test bacteria were used for the main detection by agar diffusion: Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538P, Corynebacterium xerosis NCTC 9755, Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778, and B. subtilis ATCC 6633. Identification after TLC was achieved by bioautography with the most sensitive microorganism(s). This method allows one laboratory technician to analyze up to 30 feed samples within 2.5 working days, provided that feeds of the same category are analyzed in the same run, and that labels of additives are available. Qualitative and semiquantitative information are valuable when performing a quantitative antibiotic determination and it provides proof that the activity determined is due to the tested substance. This last feature is essential from the perspective of quality assurance of results.
TI  - Two-component anti-Staphylococcus aureus lantibiotic activity produced by Staphylococcus aureus C55.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus C55 was shown to produce bacteriocin activity comprising three distinct peptide components, termed staphylococcins C55alpha, C55beta, and C55gamma. The three peptides were purified to homogeneity by a simple four-step purification procedure that consisted of ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by XAD-2 and reversed-phase (C8 and C18) chromatography. The yield following C8 chromatography was about 86%, with a more-than-300-fold increase in specific activity. When combined in approximately equimolar amounts, staphylococcins C55alpha and C55beta acted synergistically to kill S. aureus or Micrococcus luteus but not S. epidermidis strains. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of all three peptides were obtained and staphylococcins C55alpha and C55beta were shown to be lanthionine-containing (lantibiotic) molecules with molecular weights of 3,339 and 2,993, respectively. The C55gamma peptide did not appear to be a lantibiotic, nor did it augment the inhibitory activities of staphylococcin C55alpha and/or C55beta. Plasmids of 2. 5 and 32.0 kb are present in strain C55, and following growth of this strain at elevated temperature (42 degreesC), a large proportion of the progeny failed to produce strong bacteriocin activity and also lost the 32.0-kb plasmid. Protoplast transformation of these bacteria with purified 32-kb plasmid DNA regenerates the ability to produce the strong bacteriocin activity.
TI  - Characterization of antibacterial COOH-terminal proenkephalin-A-derived peptides  (PEAP) in infectious fluids. Importance of enkelytin, the antibacterial PEAP209-237 secreted by stimulated chromaffin cells.
AB  - Proenkephalin-A (PEA) and its derived peptides (PEAP) have been described in neural, neuroendocrine tissues and immune cells. The processing of PEA has been extensively studied in the adrenal medulla chromaffin cell showing that maturation starts with the removal of the carboxyl-terminal PEAP209-239. In 1995, our laboratory has shown that antibacterial activity is present within the intragranular chromaffin granule matrix and in the extracellular medium following exocytosis. More recently, we have identified an intragranular peptide, named enkelytin, corresponding to the bisphosphorylated PEAP209-237, that inhibits the growth of Micrococcus luteus (Goumon, Y., Strub, J. M., Moniatte, M., Nullans, G., Poteur, L., Hubert, P., Van Dorsselaer, A., Aunis, D., and Metz-Boutigue, M. H. (1996) Eur. J. Biochem. 235, 516-525). As a continuation of this previous study, in order to characterize the biological function of antibacterial PEAP, we have here examined whether this COOH-terminal fragment is released from stimulated chromaffin cells and whether it could be detected in wound fluids and in polymorphonuclear secretions following cell stimulation. The antibacterial spectrum shows that enkelytin is active against several Gram-positive bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, but it is unable to inhibit the Gram-negative bacteria growth. In order to relate the antibacterial activity of enkelytin with structural features, various synthetic enkelytin-derived peptides were tested. We also propose a computer model of synthetic PEAP209-237 deduced from 1H NMR analysis, in order to relate the antibacterial activity of enkelytin with the three-dimensional structure. Finally, we report the high phylogenetic conservation of the COOH-terminal PEAP, which implies some important biological function and we discuss the putative importance of enkelytin in the defensive processes.
TI  - Production of a mixture of antimicrobial organic acids from lactose by co-culture of Bifidobacterium longum and Propionibacterium freudenreichii.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of standard solutions of three organic acids (lactic, acetic, and propionic acids) were compared using Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas sp. and Staphylococcus aureus as test microorganisms. At the same concentrations of the undissociated form, the antimicrobial activities of acetic and propionic acids were higher than that of lactic acid, irrespective of test microorganisms. In a single cultivation of Bifidobacterium longum, a mixture of lactic (17 g/l) and acetic (20 g/l) acids was produced from 50 g/l lactose and its antimicrobial activities against M. luteus, Pseudomonas sp., and S. aureus correspond to that of 32, 19, and 25 g/l of acetic acid, respectively. To increase the total antimicrobial activity, a co-culture of B. longum and Propionibacterium freudenreichii, in which lactic acid produced once from lactose by B. longum was converted to acetic and propionic acids by P. freudenreichii, was done using TPY medium containing commercially available peptones as a nitrogen source. By the sequential conversion of lactose using the two microorganisms, the culture supernatant containing a mixture of acetic (27 g/l) and propionic (13 g/l) acids without lactic acid was produced. The antimicrobial activities of the mixture against M. luteus, Pseudomonas sp., and S. aureus were 35, 30, and 26 g/l as a concentration of acetic acid, respectively, higher than that obtained in the cultivation of B. longum alone. When the medium containing an enzymatic hydrolyzate of whey proteins with a protease was used in the co-culture of B. longum and P. freudenreichii, the culture supernatant containing the mixture of organic acids was also obtained in the same manner as the co-culture using TPY medium and the activities were 43, 29, and 29 g/l as a concentration of acetic acid for M. luteus, Pseudomonas sp. and S. aureus, respectively.
TI  - Production of interleukin-12 by murine macrophages in response to bacterial peptidoglycan.
AB  - Peptidoglycan (PG), a component of the bacterial cell wall, has various immunomodulating activities, including the capacity to induce delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions to antigens administered in Freund's adjuvant. We report that PG induces interleukin-12 (IL-12) mRNA production and IL-12 secretion by mouse macrophages. The capacity of PG to induce IL-12 production, like its previously reported immunomodulating activities, was dependent on the structure of its peptide subunit. PG from Bacillus megaterium and Staphylococcus aureus induced IL-12 production, whereas PG from Micrococcus luteus and Corynebacterium poinsettiae did not. The ability of most bacterial PGs to induce IL-12 production suggests that they play an important role in triggering host defense mechanisms against bacterial infections.
TI  - Cloning of aas, a gene encoding a Staphylococcus saprophyticus surface protein with adhesive and autolytic properties.
AB  - A gene encoding a novel cell wall-associated protein of Staphylococcus saprophyticus that binds fibronectin and to sheep erythrocytes has been cloned and sequenced. The 4392 bp open reading frame codes for an amino acid sequence that is quite similar to the Atl, an autolysin, of Staphylococcus aureus and to the AtlE of S. epidermidis. The two regions of most pronounced homology code for an N-acetyl-muramyl-L-alanine amidase and for an endo-beta-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase. The cloned protein lysed cells of S. saprophyticus and Micrococcus luteus exogenously. Subcloning localized the enzymatic activities to the regions of high homology and demonstrated that the interposed sequence is responsible for the adhesive activities. Two allelic replacement mutants were constructed that lacked autolytic activity and adhesive properties. The N-terminal portion of the protein contains seven highly conserved, contiguous repeats with no similarity to published sequences. It lacks the motifs typical of Gram-positive surface proteins and shows a different overall organization. This autolysin/adhesin of S. saprophyticus (Aas) appears to represent a new class of staphylococcal adhesins.
TI  - Bacteriolytic activity and specificity of Achromobacter beta-lytic protease.
AB  - Achromobacter beta-lytic protease (blp), one of the bacteriolytic proteases secreted by Achromobacter lyticus, exhibited both peptidase and bacteriolytic activities at alkaline pH. The protease was strongly inhibited by 1,10-phenanthroline, and one zinc atom was detected in the molecule by ion-spray mass spectrometry. The zinc-protease specifically cleaved Gly-X bonds in peptides and possibly possessed subsites S2, S1, S1', and S2' for binding substrate [Schecter, I. and Berger, A. (1967) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 27, 157-162]. Blp lysed Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus cells more efficiently than Achromobacter alpha-lytic protease (alp) and lysozyme, thus being responsible for the high bacteriolytic activity of A. lyticus. In the lysis of bacterial cell walls, blp hydrolyzed both the D-Ala-Gly/Ala bond at the linkage between the peptide subunit and the interpeptide and the Gly-Gly bond in the interpeptide bridge. These results indicate that blp is a highly active bacteriolytic enzyme with a broad bacteriolytic spectrum, which acts primarily by splitting the linkage between the peptide subunit and the interpeptide in the peptidoglycan.
TI  - In vitro determination of direct antimicrobial effect of calcium hydroxide.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine in vitro the time required for calcium hydroxide in direct contact with microorganisms to express its antimicrobial effect. The microorganisms used were: Micrococcus luteus (ATCC-9341), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC-6538), Fusobacterium nucleatum (ATCC-25586), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC-27853), Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus sp. The strains were cultivated in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI), with the exception of F. nucleatum (BHI-PRAS). Pure and mixed suspensions of the microorganisms were prepared. Paper cones immersed in these substances were covered with calcium hydroxide paste, and after 0, 1, 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h and 7 days they were transferred to an appropriate medium to observe the growth and multiplication of the microorganisms. Incubation was conducted at 37 degrees C for 48 h, according to the requirements of oxygen of each microorganism. The antimicrobial effect of calcium hydroxide was shown to occur after 12 h on M. luteus and F. nucleatum, 24 h on Streptococcus sp, 48 h on E. coli, and 72 h on S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. Mixture II (M. luteus + Streptococcus sp + S. aureus) was sensitive to calcium hydroxide antimicrobial potential after 48 h, whereas mixture I (M. luteus + E. coli + P. aeruginosa), mixture III (E. coli + P. aeruginosa), and mixture IV (S. aureus + P. aeruginosa) were inactivated after 72 h of exposure.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of an antibiotic produced by the scab disease-suppressive Streptomyces diastatochromogenes strain PonSSII.
AB  - An antibiotic produced by the scab disease-suppressive Streptomyces diastatochromogenes strain PonSSII has been isolated and partially characterized. The antibiotic is produced throughout culture growth, with maximum amounts accumulating in the broth when the culture is in the early stationary phase of growth. The activity declines within about 30 h after the culture enters stationary phase. Purification techniques included chromatography on Amberlite XAD-2, DEAE Sephadex and SP Sephadex in addition to C18 HPLC with an average yield of 75%. This antibiotic only inhibits pathogenic strains of S. scabies that cause scab disease on potato and other tuberous vegetables and does not affect S. griseus, S. venezuelae, Actinomyces bovis, Nocardia asteroides, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus luteus, Serratia marcescens and Escherichia coli. The antibiotic has a molecular weight of 500 or less, and is stable for weeks at acidic pH but is very labile at alkaline pH conditions.
TI  - Hyperproduction of alpha-toxin by Staphylococcus aureus results in paradoxically  reduced virulence in experimental endocarditis: a host defense role for platelet microbicidal proteins.
AB  - Staphylococcal alpha-toxin targets several cell types which are important components of cardiac vegetations in endocarditis, including platelets, erythrocytes, and endothelial cells. We evaluated the in vivo role of Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin in experimental endocarditis by using isogenic strains differing in the capacity to produce functional alpha-toxin, including 8325-4 (wild-type strain), DU-1090 (a mutant strain with allelic replacement of the alpha-toxin gene [hla]), DU1090(pH35L) (a mutant strain producing a target cell-binding but nonlytic toxin), DU1090(pDU1212) (a variant of DU1090 carrying the cloned hla gene on a multicopy plasmid), and DU1090(pCL84::hla) (a variant of DU1090 with a single copy of the hla gene cloned into the chromosomal lipase locus). In vitro, wild-type alpha-toxin (from parental strain 8325-4) extensively lysed both erythrocytes and platelets. In contrast, mutant alpha-toxin [from strain DU1090(pH35L)] lysed neither cell type. Following exposure to the wild-type alpha-toxin, platelet lysates were found to contain microbicidal activity against Bacillus subtilis (but not against Micrococcus luteus), as well as against the parental and alpha-toxin variant S. aureus strains noted above. Furthermore, lysate microbicidal activity was heat stable, neutralized by polyanionic filters or compounds, and recoverable from anionic filter membranes by hypertonic saline elution. These characteristics are consistent with those of cationic platelet microbicidal proteins (PMPs). Reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis confirmed the presence of three distinct PMPs (1, 2, and 3) in platelet lysates. In experimental endocarditis, the two variant staphylococcal strains producing either minimal alpha-toxin or nonlytic alpha-toxin in vitro [strains DU1090 and DU1090(pH35L), respectively] exhibited significantly lower virulence in vivo than the parental strain (decreased intravegetation staphylococcal densities). Paradoxically, the two variant staphylococcal strains producing alpha-toxin at supraparental levels in vitro [strains DU1090(p1212) and DU1090(pCL84::hla)] also exhibited significantly decreased induction rates and intravegetation staphylococcal densities in experimental endocarditis versus the parental strain. The reduced in vivo virulence of the latter variant staphylococcal strains could not be explained by differences in bacteremic clearance or initial adherence to sterile vegetations (compared to the parental strain). These findings suggest that the reduced virulence exhibited by the variant staphylococcal strains in this model was related to pathogenetic events subsequent to bacterial adherence to the damaged endocardium. Excess intravegetation secretion of alpha-toxin, leading to increased PMP release (secondary to either increased platelet secretion or lysis), may well explain the reduced virulence observed in experimental endocarditis.
TI  - Serum concentrations and ex vivo inhibitory/bactericidal activity of clindamycin  after administration of two oral dosages.
AB  - Two dosages of clindamycin, 300 and 600 mg, were given orally to 10 patients each. The patients were admitted for minor elective surgery. Their mean age was 39.3 years; mean weight was 67.5 kg. None of them had taken antibiotics for at least 1 month. After administration of a single dose, blood samples were obtained at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 h after dosing. Drug levels were determined by the bioassay method using Micrococcus luteus as test organism. Serum inhibitory and bactericidal activities against five isolates each of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes were determined by the microdilution method according to the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards guidelines. The mean peak serum level was 3.4 mg/l for the 300-mg dose and 4.8 mg/l for the 600-mg dose. The mean reciprocal peak inhibitory titers for the 300-/600-mg doses were 13.7/23.8 and 15.2/34.7 against S. aureus and S. pyogenes, respectively. Most serum samples did not show bactericidal activity against S. aureus.
TI  - The stethoscope. A potential source of nosocomial infection?
AB  - BACKGROUND: Stethoscope diaphragms have been shown to harbor potentially pathogenic bacteria. OBJECTIVES: To assess bacterial contamination on the diaphragm and under the plastic rim that secures the diaphragm of stethoscopes of physicians, nurses, medical students, and house staff in an intensive care unit and a general medical ward of a large university hospital. Also to compare the effectiveness of various cleaning agents and assess the transmissibility of bacteria from contaminated stethoscopes to human skin. METHODS: Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures were performed on 40 randomly selected stethoscopes. We compared the effects of isopropyl alcohol, sodium hypochlorite (bleach), and benzalkonium chloride swabs, as well as soap and water, on reducing bacterial contamination on the stethoscope diaphragm and under the rim. The transmissibility of Micrococcus luteus inoculated onto a stethoscope diaphragm to clean human skin was also determined. RESULTS: Eleven genera and species of bacteria were isolated, with coagulase-negative staphylococcus present on 100% of stethoscopes and Staphylococcus aureus on 38%. Clostridium difficile was not isolated. The mean (+/-SE) number of total colony-forming units was 158 +/- 33 per diaphragm and 289 +/- 54 per rim. Physicians' stethoscope diaphragms had significantly more colony-forming units of coagulase-negative staphylococci than those of nurses: 163 +/- 44 vs 50 +/- 12, respectively (P = .02). The most effective cleaning agent was isopropyl alcohol after cleaning the diaphragm surface, the stethoscope diaphragms contained 0.2 +/- 0.2 colony-forming units and the rims contained 2.2 +/- 1.5 colony-forming units (P = .01). In addition, M luteus was transferred from inoculated stethoscopes to human skin. CONCLUSIONS: Most stethoscopes harbor potential pathogens but are not a source of C difficile. Physicians' stethoscopes generally had a higher bacterial load than nurses' stethoscopes. Isopropyl alcohol is an effective cleaning agent when applied to the stethoscope diaphragm. Stethoscopes transfer M luteus to human skin, making it likely that other bacteria can be transferred as well.
TI  - Identification and isolation of a bactericidal domain in chicken egg white lysozyme.
AB  - Chicken egg white lysozyme exhibits antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Fractionation of clostripain-digested lysozyme yielded a pentadecapeptide with antimicrobial activity but without muramidase activity. The peptide was isolated and its sequence found to be I-V-S-D-G-N-G-M-N-A-W-V-A-W-R (amino acids 98-112 of chicken egg white lysozyme). A synthesized peptide of identical sequence had the same bactericidal activity as the natural peptide. Replacement of Trp 108 with tyrosine significantly reduced the antibacterial capacity of the peptide. By replacement of Trp 111 with tyrosine the antibacterial activity was lost. Replacement of Asn 106 with the positively charged arginine strongly increased the antibacterial capacity of I-V-S-D-G-N-G-M-N-A-W-V-A-W-R. The peptide I-V-S-D-G-N-G-M consisting of the eight amino acids of the N-terminal side had no bactericidal properties, whereas the peptide N-A-W-V-A-W-R of the C-terminal side retained some bactericidal activity. Replacement of asparagine 106 by arginine (R-A-W-V-A-W-R) increased the bactericidal activity considerably. The D enantiomer of R-A-W-V-A-W-R was as active as the L form against five of the tested bacteria, but substantially less active against Serratia marcescens, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus lentus. For these bacterial species some stereospecific complementarity between receptor structures of the bacteria and the peptide can be assumed.
TI  - Susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to a photodynamic effect of the arginine hematoporphyrin derivative.
AB  - The photodynamic effect of the arginine hematoporphyrin derivative (HpD-Arg(2)) on the growth of selected Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates is described as compared to the effect of hematoporphyrin derivative (HpD). Growth inhibition of HpD-Arg(2) of three Gram-positive strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Micrococcus luteus) and five laboratory strains of Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae) was observed as well. Serratia marcescens strain was resistant to light-activated HpD-Arg(2) or HpD. The antimicrobial activity of light-activated HpD-Arg(2) against P. aeruginosa may offer an additional option in the anti-pseudomonal therapy of wounds.
TI  - A family of novel macrocyclic lactones, the saccharocarcins produced by Saccharothrix aerocolonigenes subsp. antibiotica. I. Taxonomy, fermentation, isolation and biological properties.
AB  - A nocardioform actinomycete, SCC 1886, isolated from a soil sample collected in Ohio was found to produce, in fermentation, six novel macrocyclic lactones, the saccharocarcins. The producing culture was identified as Saccharothrix aerocolonigenes subsp. antibiotica based on the formation of fragmenting substrate mycelia, aerial mycelia that coalesce to form aerial colonies, whole-cell hydrolysates that contain meso-diaminopimelic acid, galactose and rhamnose and physiological comparisons to type species of the genus. Peak production of the saccharocarcins occurred after 95 hours of fermentation in a starch rich medium. The compounds were isolated from the fermentation broth by solvent extraction and purified by HPLC. Isolated compounds were active against Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus and Chlamydia trachomatis; none were cytotoxic at concentrations up to 1.0 microgram/ml.
TI  - Nahua indian medicinal plants (Mexico): Inhibitory activity on NF-kappaB as an anti-inflammatory model and antibacterial effects.
AB  - Selected plants documented as medicinal in an ethnobotanical study with the Nahua of the Sierra de Zongolica (Veracruz, Mexico) were evaluated for anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activity. One of the potential sides of action of anti-inflammatory drugs is the transcription factor NF-kappaB. This factor is essential for the immune, inflammatory, and acute phase responses. We therefore tested extracts from a total of 28 plants used by the Nahua Indians for their potential effect on the activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. The leaves of Tithonia diversifolia (Hemsl.) A. Gray (Asteraceae) was the only extract which showed inhibitory activity. Nonspecific DNA binding activities were not noticably influenced. Phytochemical studies to isolate the active principle and further biochemical studies in order to better understand the mode of action of this NF-kappaB inhibitor have been initiated. Five plants showed noteworthy antibacterial activity against some pathogenic (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25933 and Yersinia enterocolitica 03) and nonpathogenic (E. coli DSM 1077, Micrococcus luteus DSM 348) microorganism: Acacia cornigera, Cuscuta tinctoria, Ludwigia octovalvis, Lysiloma divaricata, and Tithonia diversifolia.
TI  - Inactivation of bacteria and yeasts on agar surfaces with high power Nd:YAG laser light.
AB  - Near infrared light from a high-powered, 1064 nm, Neodymium:Yttrium Aluminium Garnet (Nd:YAG) laser killed a variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and two yeasts, lawned on nutrient agar plates. A beam (cross-sectional area, 1.65 cm2) of laser light was delivered in 10 J, 8 ms pulses at 10 Hz, in a series of exposure times. For each microbial species, a dose/response curve was obtained of area of inactivation vs energy density (J cm-2). The energy density that gave an inactivation area (IA) equal to 50% of the beam area was designated the IA50-value and was plotted together with its 95% confidence limits. Average IA50-values were all within a threefold range and varied from 1768 J cm-2 for Serratia marcescens to 4489 J cm-2 for vegetative cells of Bacillus stearothermophilus. There were no systematic differences in sensitivity attributable to cell shape, size, pigmentation or Gram reaction. At the lowest energy densities where inactivation was achieved for the majority of organisms (around 2000 J cm-2), no effect was observed on the nutrient agar surface, but as the energy density was increased, a depression in the agar surface was formed, followed by localized melting of the agar.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Paliurus spina-christi Mill. (Christ's thorn).
AB  
TI  - Highly selective acridine and ethidium staining of bacterial DNA and RNA.
AB  - The acridine dyes acridine orange (AO) and coriphosphine O (CPO) and ethidium bromide (EtBr) were used to stain bacterial digests after electrophoresis in native and denaturing (SDS) polyacrylamide gels and were shown to stain DNA and RNA preferentially over other subcellular components in the gels. Vegetative cell digests of Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus showed intense staining of DNA with AO and CPO near the top of the gel, but little or no staining of other cellular constituents. EtBr stained both DNA and RNA in the gels. Protein standards and non-nucleic acid cellular constituents stained faintly with high concentrations (> or = 100 microM) of AO, lower concentrations (13.9 microM) of CPO, and did not stain with 0.5 microgram/ml EtBr in denaturing gels. The complete set of cellular biochemicals was visualized by silver staining, while the protein subset was detected by Coomassie blue staining. The highest concentrations of AO (120 microM) and CPO (13.9 microM) were shown to detect purified DNA in gels with a sensitivity in the range of 25-50 ng per band. This work demonstrates the specificity of acridine and ethidium dyes for nucleic acids, while illustrating the level of non-nucleic acid-specific interactions with other cellular components by staining of electrophoretically separated cellular components in a gel matrix.
TI  - Evaluation of current sterility tests for human live viral vaccines.
AB  - Current sterility tests for human viral vaccines were evaluated. A total of 43 lots of bulk suspension of live viral vaccines (measles, mumps, rubella and oral poliomyelitis) produced by six manufacturers in Japan were evaluated for bacteriostatic and mycoplasmastatic activities. Some of them showed fairly high bacteriostatic and mycoplasmastatic activities, due to antibiotics added during vaccine production. It was concluded that the current sterility test for mycoplasmas is not reliable to detect viable mycoplasmas in live viral vaccines.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro antibacterial activity of spermidine-based mixed catechol- and hydroxamate-containing siderophore--vancomycin conjugates.
AB  - The first antibiotic conjugates of vancomycin (1) and siderophore analogues containing spermidine-based catechol ligands (conjugate 11) as well as mixed catechol and hydroxamate ligands (conjugate 13) are described. The design of the conjugates was based on the earlier observation that conjugation of siderophore components to beta-lactam antibiotics induced active iron transport-mediated drug delivery. The novel conjugates (11 and 13) were synthesized by selective acylation of the primary amino group of 1. Preliminary biological studies indicated that siderophore modified vancomycins lost some activity (4- to 16-fold) against Gram-positive bacteria relative to vancomycin itself, and were generally similar to vancomycin in activity against Gram-negative bacteria under iron-sufficient conditions. However, under iron-depleted conditions which mimic human serum, conjugate 11 displayed enhanced antibacterial activity against an antibiotic hypersensitive strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Interactions of human mannose-binding protein with lipoteichoic acids.
AB  - We explored the interaction of human recombinant mannose-binding protein and lipoteichoic acids (LTAs) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The best ligand was Micrococcus luteus lipomannan, followed by Enterococcus spp. LTA containing mono-, di-, and oligoglucosyl substituents. LTAs lacking terminal sugars (those of Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus) or containing galactosyl substituents (those of Listeria spp. and Lactococcus spp.) were poor ligands. These results are consistent with known structural requirements for binding through the mannose-binding protein carbohydrate recognition domain.
TI  - BE-24566B, a new antibiotic produced by Streptomyces violaceusniger.
AB  
TI  - [Relationship between the synthesis of a new stress response component and bacterial cell metabolism].
AB  - Various stress factors (incubation with redox-cycling agents, ozonization, heat shock) that induced accumulation of 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-2,4-cyclopyrophosphate (MEC) were also shown to induce various alterations of the phospholipid composition in three microbial species: Corynebacterium ammoniagenes, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus. The influence of adding 10 carbohydrates to the growth medium on MEC accumulation by C. ammoniagenes cells was tested. Only glucose and mannose exerted a pronounced stimulatory effect on the MEC synthesis under oxidative stress. The target of oxidative attack whose transformation causes MEC synthesis is suggested to be located near or on the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane.
TI  - Humoral defense of the nematode Ascaris suum: antibacterial, bacteriolytic and agglutinating activities in the body fluid.
AB  - Three humoral defense activities (antibacterial, bacteriolytic and agglutinating) were detected in the body fluid of the nematode Ascaris suum. Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis) were more sensitive to the antibacterial activity than the Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli). The antibacterial activity was heat stable and was lost by trypsin digestion. The molecular mass of the factor responsible for antibacterial activity was estimated as 6 kDa. The bacteriolytic activity against dried Micrococcus luteus was also detected. The bacteriolytic factor was 6-9 kDa in molecular mass, heat sensitive and trypsin sensitive. Both E. coli and glutaraldehyde-fixed trypsin-treated human A-type red blood cells were agglutinated in the body fluid. An analytical gel permeation HPLC revealed the agglutinating activity consists of at least two factors. Activities of both agglutinating factors were lost by heat treatment or trypsin digestion. The molecular masses estimated for the two agglutinating factors were 500 kDa and 25 kDa. Under experimental conditions, microbe-injection was not a prerequisite for the appearance of these defense activities.
TI  - Mode of action of the lantibiotic mersacidin: inhibition of peptidoglycan biosynthesis via a novel mechanism?
AB  - Mersacidin is an antibiotic peptide produced by Bacillus sp. strain HIL Y-85,54728 that belongs to the group of lantibiotics. Its activity in vivo against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains compares with that of the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin (S. Chatterjee, D. K. Chatterjee, R. H. Jani, J. Blumbach, B. N. Ganguli, N. Klesel, M. Limbert, and G. Seibert, J. Antibiot. 45:839-845, 1992). Incubation of Staphylococcus simulans 22 with mersacidin resulted in the cessation of growth and slow lysis. Biosyntheses of DNA, RNA, and protein were not affected, whereas incorporation of glucose and D-alanine was inhibited and a regular reduction in the level of cell wall thickness was observed. Thus, unlike type A lantibiotics, mersacidin does not form pores in the cytoplasmic membrane but rather inhibits cell wall biosynthesis. Comparison with tunicamycin-treated cells indicated that peptidoglycan rather than teichoic acid metabolism is primarily affected. Mersacidin caused the excretion of a putative cell wall precursor into the culture supernatant. The formation of polymeric peptidoglycan was effectively inhibited in an in vitro assay, probably on the level of transglycosylation. In contrast to vancomycin, the activity of mersacidin was not antagonized by the tripeptide diacetyl-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala, indicating that on the molecular level its mode of action differs from those of glycopeptide antibiotics. These data together with electron microscopy suggest that mersacidin acts on a novel target, which opens new perspectives for the treatment of methicillin-resistant S. aureus.
TI  - Total structures and antimicrobial activity of bacitracin minor components.
AB  - Total structures of 13 minor components of bacitracin (BC) were proposed, and their antimicrobial activities were investigated. The components of BC including bacitracins A (BC-A) and F (BC-F) were isolated by preparative HPLC and were hydrolyzed under acidic conditions. The resulting amino aids were derivatized with 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrophenyl-5-L-alanineamide and were separated by HPLC to determine their absolute configurations. It was found that the N-terminal amino acids of BC-A and its related components were epimerized during the hydrolysis to yield their enantiomers. The formation of these artifactual amino acids suggests that our previously proposed structures of the BC minor components are incorrect; therefore, the structures were corrected based on these results. The structures of the BC minor components were the same as that of BCs-A and -F except that one to three of the L-isoleucines, including the N-terminal one, were replaced by L-valines. These structures were confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry under fast atom bombardment (FAB) conditions and Frit-FAB liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Based on the UV spectra of the BC components determined by photodiode array detection-HPLC analysis, a new systematic nonmenclature was proposed for the minor components. The isolated components were also used for the determination of their minimal inhibition concentrations and it was found that BC-A is 2 approximately 8 times more potent than the other minor components against strains of Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Transformation of microorganisms with the plasmid vector with the replicon from pAC1 from Acetobacter pasteurianus.
AB  - A number of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria species was screened for the expression of the gram-negative plasmid pACK5 and pACT72 with replicon of pAC1 plasmid from Acetobacter pasteurianus. As was described previously, both plasmids were expressed in Escherichia coli, Acetobacter pasteurianus, Acetobacter aceti, Shigella spp. and Citrobacter spp. Expressions of plasmids were successful in twelve species tested, Comamonas terrigena, Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescens, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus megatericum, Bacillus subtilis, Lactobacillus helveticus, Micrococcus luteus, Sarcina lutea, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptoccocus feacalis, and the stability of plasmid DNA was tested after cultivation in non-selective conditions.
TI  - In vivo effects of urease-producing bacteria involved with the pathogenesis of infection-induced urolithiasis on renal urokinase and sialidase activity.
AB  - Many hypotheses have been proposed for renal stone formation. It has been argued  that with infection-induced renal stones the hydrolysis of urea by bacterial urease increases urinary pH, with consequent stone formation. Unfortunately, this theory is not applicable to the micro-organisms that do not produce urease (e.g. Escherichia coli). It has been recently reported that E. coli reduces the urinary urokinase activity of male rats, but does not influence the urinary sialidase activity. This study has now been expanded to the urease-producing bacteria Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Micrococcus luteus. Subcutaneous injections with these bacteria were found to significantly (P < 0.003) reduce the UK activity of extrarenally obstructed kidneys. The urease-producing mammalian skin bacterium, M. luteus, was, however, the exception (P = 0.1079). In contrast to S. epidermidis, P. aeruginosa and M. luteus (P < 0.0213), P. mirabilis and S. aureus had no effect on renal sialidase activity (P < 0.4047). These results may explain why Proteus species are predominant in infection-induced renal stones. According to the urokinase-sialidase hypothesis, a decrease in urinary urokinase activity should increase the uromucoid levels, whilst no effect on the urinary sialidase activity should favour conversion of urinary uromucoid to mineralizable matrix. These conditions may lead to renal stone formation. An increase in urinary pH resulting from urease-producing micro-organisms will increase salt precipitation on the uromucoid. It is thus concluded that urease-producing bacteria may play a double role in renal stone formation.
TI  - Purification of DNA polymerase III of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  
TI  - Alteration of bacteriolytic enzyme profile of Staphylococcus aureus during growth.
AB  - Profiles of cell-associated bacteriolytic activities and those in the culture supernatant of Staphylococcus aureus FDA209P at various stages of growth were analyzed using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels containing Micrococcus luteus or S. aureus. In the logarithmic growth phase, the cell-associated bacteriolytic activities extracted with Triton X-100 contained a number of bacteriolytic proteins, the profiles of which were similar to those we reported elsewhere (Sugai, M., Akiyama, T., Komatsuzawa, H., Miyake, Y., and Suginaka, H. (1990) J. Bacteriol., 172, 6494-6498). The proteins include P1, P2, P7, P9, PX, P13, P18 and other minor components. At the stationary growth phase, the bacteriolytic band-profile of the Triton X-100 extract changed dramatically. P1, P7 and P9 disappeared, and the other minor bands had markedly decreased band intensities. On the other hand, P2, PX, P13, and P18 retained their band intensities during the stationary growth phase. The band intensities of P7, P13, PX, and P18 increased in the supernatant during the logarithmic growth phase. These results indicated that the bacteriolytic band-profile changes during growth.
TI  - Antimicrobial isoflavans from Astragalus species.
AB  - Two new antimicrobial isoflavans, 1-[(3R)-7,8-dimethoxybenzopyranyl]-4- hydroxybenzoquinone (astragaluquinone) and (3S)-7,1'-dihydroxy-8,3'-dimethoxyisoflavan (8-methoxyvestitol), and the known 7-hydroxy-2',3',4'-trimethoxyisoflavan were isolated from roots of Astragalus alexandrinus and A. trigonus. The structures of the new isoflavans were established by spectroscopic methods.
TI  - [Bacteria-reducing properties of copper-containing and non-copper-containing materials. II. Relationship between microbiocide effect of copper-containing materials and copper ion concentration after contamination with moist and dry hands].
AB  - The bactericide quality of different materials containing copper (copper, brass,  brass-sheet) was tested and particularly the effect of humidity and copper-concentration was examined. In first examinations (I. communication) (19) the materials were contaminated by hands, which were dipped into a suspension of different microorganisms (Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The survival rate of the microorganisms on the surfaces was determined after defined exposure times (0, 5, 30, 60, 120 min). The following ways of contaminating the test materials were chosen: single contamination with wet hands, repeated contamination with wet and dry hands. In this examination the results were tested for statistical significance and in parallel experiments the copper-concentration on the surfaces of the materials was determined. Materials containing copper contaminated with wet hands show a significant bactericide effect after an exposure time of 120 min. The bactericide effect on Micrococcus luteus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa is inhibited after contamination with dry hands. This results can not be explained by a different copper-concentration on the surfaces of the materials, because a statistically significant difference of copper-ion concentrations between contamination with wet and dry hands could not be obtained.
TI  - Bactericidal activity in the pig roundworm Ascaris suum.
AB  - A potent, humoral, bactericidal activity against Micrococcus luteus was discovered in pseudocoelomic fluid of the pig roundworm, Ascaris suum. The activity, which was not bacteriolytic, was not due to lysozyme or to a dietary antibiotic. It was not inactivated by exposure to 100 degrees C, to low or high pH, or to ethanol. Dialysis, electrophoresis and agar-diffusion experiments suggested that the main antibacterial activity in the fluid was associated with a basic substance of molecular weight somewhat less than 14,000 Da. Two other Gram-positive organisms, Bacillus megaterium and Staphylococcus aureus, were also killed by the Ascaris fluid, but the Gram-negative Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris and Bordetella bronchiseptica were insensitive.
TI  - [Bacterial reducing qualities of copper-containing and non-copper-containing materials. I. Contamination and sedimentation in humid and dry conditions].
AB  - In this examination the bactericide qualities of different materials were tested. Particularly the effect of humidity was examined. 3 materials containing copper ("copper", "brass" and "brass sheet") and 2 materials not containing copper ("polyamide B" and "high-grade steel") were tested. The surfaces of the 5 types of material were contaminated with a suspension of 2 different bacteria species (Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus). After defined exposure times the survival rate of the microorganisms on the surfaces was determined by the standardized method of the "Guidelines of the German Society of Hygiene and Microbiology". Additionally the sedimentation of airborne microorganisms on the materials was tested by determining the number of colony-forming-units after defined exposure times. In further examinations the materials were contaminated by hands, which were dipped into a suspension of different microorganisms (Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The following ways of contaminating the test materials were chosen: single contamination with wet hands, repeated contamination with wet and dry hands. After defined exposure times the survival rate of the microorganisms on the surfaces was determined. The results show, a bactericide quality of copper depends on the percent of copper-content of the tested materials, exposure time, humidity, frequency of contamination and bacteria species. Humidity and only single contamination cause a reduction of bacteria. Reduction of gram-negative bacteria is more easily than reduction of gram-positive bacteria. Enterococcus faecium shows the highest, Pseudomonas aeruginosa the lowest reduction rate of bacteria in the following sequence: Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity in vitro of chlorhexidine, a mixture of isothiazolinones ('Kathon' CG) and cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB).
AB  - Chlorehexidine, two 4% chlorhexidine antiseptic handwashes ('Bioprep' and 'Hibiclens'), cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) and isothiazolinones ('Kathon') were tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris and Candida albicans. The activities measured were the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum microbicidal concentration (MMC), rate of kill in water and broth, effect of organic soil, the development of microbial resistance on continuous exposure and agent bioavailability in media and formulation. 'Kathon' was the most active microbistatic agent showing maximal activity at low concentration, least inactivation by organic soil and media components and the lowest level of development of bacterial resistance. It was synergistic with chlorhexidine against S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa. Media, formulation components and organic soil affected the performance of chlorhexidine and CTAB. Chlorhexidine was more broadly active than CTAB but showed a greater reduction in activity in the presence of soil and engendered a greater level of bacterial resistance. It was more rapidly bactericidal to P. aeruginosa and S. marcescens than to S. aureus. Stable resistance to chlorhexidine and CTAB was developed by P. aeruginosa and S. marcescens, the latter showing the higher level of resistance. Chlorhexidine-resistant strains were also resistant to CTAB. The antiseptic formulations were more rapidly bactericidal than chlorhexidine alone but were otherwise of comparable activity. Mixtures of disinfectants, in particular a combination of chlorhexidine and a preservative level of 'Kathon', were more active than single disinfectants. The importance of standardization of media and test conditions and the use of chemically defined media for accurate and reproducible in-vitro testing of disinfectant activity is emphasized. Disinfection kinetics, expressed as time-kill curves, log reduction factors or decimal reduction times were shown to be valuable in differentiating microbistatic from microbicidal activity, showing the effects of dilution and soil on activity and indicating possible different mechanisms of action.
TI  - Characterization of microbial flora of leprous ulcers infested with maggots.
AB  - Swabs from 64 maggot infested leprosy ulcers before and after treatment for maggots and 100 non-infested leprosy ulcers were studied for the bacterial flora. From maggot infested ulcers (before treatment), the cultures usually showed mixed growth. Among the Gram positive isolates, Staphylococcus aureus (37%), S. albus (18%) and Streptococcus pyogenes (36%) were frequently isolated. Gram negative bacteria isolated were Proteus spp. (21%) and Escherichia coli (7%). Anaerobic bacteria isolated were Micrococcus (3%) and Bacteroides (4%). After treatment of maggot infested ulcers, S. aureus (36%) continued to be isolated with almost the same frequency. The isolates of other Gram negative organisms were slightly reduced. Among the Gram negatives the Proteus spp. (10%) were also less in number. In few cases Neisseria (3%) was found. Anaerobic isolates were M. luteus (2%) and B. necrophorus (3%). From the cases without maggot infestation, a single organism was isolated from 16 cases and 84 mixed cultures were obtained. Isolates included the aerobic Gram positives S. aureus (46%), S. albus (21%) and S. pyogenes (38%), and the Gram negative Proteus spp. (19%) and E. coli (7%). The anaerobic isolate was M. luteus (3%). From this study no apparent association between the type of bacterial flora and maggot infestation could be observed.
TI  - The ability of bacteria to synthesize a new cyclopyrophosphate correlates with their tolerance to redox-cycling drugs: on a crossroad of chemotherapy, environmental toxicology and immunobiochemical problems.
AB  - Many redox-cyclers were recently shown to induce, in some bacterial species, large-scale biosynthesis of a new 2-methylbutan-1,2,3,4-tetraol-2,4-cyclopyrophosphate believed to be involved in anti-stress reactions. In the present study Mycobacterium smegmatis, Micrococcus luteus and Brevibacterium ammoniagenes were shown to begin synthesis of the new cyclopyrophosphate when cultivated in a medium containing furacilin or furadonin (widely used nitrofuran antibacterial drugs) and to maintain close to normal growth rates, whereas Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli were inhibited by the drugs and were unable to synthesize the cyclopyrophosphate compound. Preferential binding of Mg2+ and Cd2+ with one or other phosphoryl groups of the cyclopyrophosphate, which was indicated by selective changes of 31P-NMR chemical shifts and intramolecular hydrogen bonding, is suggested as a reason for this selectivity.
TI  - [The determination of the discrepancy between the mathematically ascertained and  experimentally provable efficiency of UV facilities for water disinfection].
AB  - Using three UV-plants of different technical designs for water disinfection, we studied the conformity between experimental germ reduction using standard test organisms and calculated UV-doses under various water flow conditions. Taking into consideration the style of construction of the UV-plants, the irradiation area and the layer thickness were used as constant parameters for dose calculations. This was also employed for the irradiation intensity, since the experiments were performed for a relatively short period compared of the life span of the UV-irradiators. Both exposure time and water transmission were employed as variable parameters in the dose calculations and experimental procedures respectively. The calculated UV-dose and experimentally obtained germ reduction values were comparatively the same for two of the three UV-plants studied. However, no correlation was observed between the reduction of E. coli and the corresponding calculated UV-dose values. Therefore, the calculated UV-dose values for any given UV-plant should be considered to be relative and by no means absolute values. We are of the opinion that within a certain range of water flow rate and transmission, antimicrobial effectiveness of different UV-plants should be demonstrated independent of dose values, technical and other construction characteristics. The applicability of the UV-plants studied is discussed.
TI  - Macrophage response to bacteria: induction of marked secretory and cellular activities by lipoteichoic acids.
AB  - Lipoteichoic acids (LTAs) from various bacterial species, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Listeria monocytogenes, were examined for the ability to induce secretory and cellular responses in a pure population of bone marrow-derived mononuclear phagocytes. Some of the highly purified LTAs, in particular LTAs from Bacillus subtilis, S. pyogenes, E. faecalis, and Enterococcus hirae, were able to affect each of the macrophage parameters measured, i.e., reductive capacity, secretion of tumor necrosis factor and nitrite, and tumoricidal activity. As after stimulation with whole organisms or other bacterial products, secretion of tumor necrosis factor induced by these LTAs reached its maximum within the first few hours of the interaction, while secretion of nitrite and tumoricidal activity required 24 to 36 h for full expression. Other purified LTAs, i.e., LTAs from Streptococcus sanguis, S. pneumoniae, and L. monocytogenes, as well as lipomannan from Micrococcus luteus affected only some of these parameters, while native LTA from S. aureus was inactive. There was no obvious correlation between biological activity and chain length, kind of glycosyl substituents, glycolipid structures, or fatty acid composition of LTAs. Deacylation of LTAs resulted in a complete loss of activity, and deacylated LTAs did not impair the activity of their acylated counterparts, suggesting that acyl chains may be essential for binding of LTA to the cell surface. The results demonstrate that some LTA species are potent inducers of macrophage secretory and cellular activities.
TI  - [Isolation and evaluation of the structure of the new anthracycline antibiotics rubomycins F and H].
AB  - The rubomycin complex produced by Streptomyces coeruleorubidus 4-157 was studied  and the two novel anthracyclines i.e. rubomycins F and H were isolated. The study of the physicochemical properties of the novel antibiotics in comparison with rubomycin C (daunomycin) and the specially prepared 3'-N-carbmethoxyrubomycin C showed that rubomycin F was 3'-N-carbethoxydaunomycin and rubomycin H was 3'-N-carbmethoxydaunomycin. Therefore, rubomycins F and H are novel representatives of natural anthracyclines undescribed previously.
TI  - Hemolytic interactions of Dermatophilus congolensis.
AB  - The strains of Dermatophilus congolensis grew on blood agar with washed sheep erythrocytes with marked total hemolysis. In testing for hemolytic interactions they gave a significant synergistic effect of a characteristic shape with Rhodococcus equi and Streptococcus agalactiae, whereas with Staphylococcus aureus producing beta hemolysin and with Staphylococcus aureus producing delta hemolysin a simultaneous synergistic as well as antagonistic effect were observed. First of all a conspicuous inhibition of in the beta hemolysin zone began and then the hemolytic effect of D. congolensis was enhanced. A similar double reaction was also observed with Listeria ivanovii. With delta hemolysin there was an inhibition of the hemolytic effect of D. congolensis and at the same time a synergistic effect could be observed. Also D. congolensis gave a weak synergistic effect with Micrococcus lylae and Listeria monocytogenes, and a further weak antagonistic effect with alpha hemolysin of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hyicus, Staphylococcus chromogenes and Micrococcus luteus. No interaction of D. congolensis was established with Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of sphingosines.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of stratum corneum lipids was examined by screening in vitro various representative phospholipids and sphingolipids. Of mixed galacto-cerebrosides; phosphatidic acid; phosphatidic acid-monomethylester-dioleoyl; phosphatidylethanolamine; phosphatidylethanolamine-beta-oleoyl-gamma-palmitoyl; phosphatidylcholine; D-sphingosine; D,L-sphinganine; 4-D-hydroxysphinganine; oleoyl-sphingosine; N,N-dimethylsphingosine; and stearylamine, only the sphingosines and, to a lesser extent, stearylamine were clearly and profoundly effective against Staphylococcus aureus (4-log reduction at 6.25 micrograms/ml [20 microM]; 2-log reduction at 0.78 mu/ml [2.5 microM]). The sphingosines were similarly active against Streptococcus pyogenes, Micrococcus luteus, Propionibacterium acnes, Brevibacterium epidermidis, and Candida albicans, moderately active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ineffective against Escherichia coli and Serratia marcescens. Both erythro- and threo-isomers were effective. Optimal inhibition was at 60 min incubation at 37 degrees C and at pH 6.5. Antimicrobial activity, which was Ca++ dependent, was confirmed in vivo by topical application and microbial challenge. Because free sphingosines are available in the stratum corneum and other epidermal layers, these lipids may contribute to the cutaneous antimicrobial barrier.
TI  - Partial characterization and staphylocidal activity of thrombin-induced platelet  microbicidal protein.
AB  - Thrombin-induced platelet microbicidal protein (PMP) is considered to play an important role in preventing an important role in preventing streptococcal endocarditis. However, the structural features and functions of PMPs have not been well characterized, and their antibacterial spectra against other common endocarditis pathogens, such as the staphylococci, are not known. Thrombin stimulation of washed rabbit platelets (10(8)/ml) yielded a PMP-rich preparation with a specific activity of approximately 25 U/mg of protein as determined by Bacillus subtilis bioassay. Twenty-eight clinical and laboratory Staphylococcus aureus isolates, exposed to a standardized PMP preparation (100 U/ml for 2 h at 37 degrees C), exhibited a Poisson-distributed heterogeneity to the bactericidal action of PMP, with approximately one-third designated as PMP resistant. Gel filtration chromatography (Sephadex G-50) identified the bioactive moiety within PMP preparations to be in the major protein elution peak; sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) presumptively identified PMP as a low-molecular-weight (MW) (8,500) protein present only in such bioactive protein peaks. Both the bioactivity of PMP preparations and the low-MW protein band were removable by specific anionic membranes (e.g., cellulose-acetate/nitrate), as well as by a variety of anionic resins, further corroborating the suspected cationic charge of PMP. In addition, both PMP bioactivity and the low-MW protein band were recoverable by 1.5 M NaCl elution of the anionic membrane filters post-PMP adsorptive removal. Adsorption of bioactive PMP preparations by highly PMP-susceptible B. subtilis (10(8) CFU/ml, 30 min) resulted in a near-complete loss of residual bioactivity; in contrast, adsorption of bioactive PMP preparations with less PMP-susceptible S. aureus strains failed to reduce bioactivity. Significant lysozyme contamination of PMP-rich preparations was ruled out by determination of differences between bioactive PMP preparations and exogenous lysozyme as regards (i) relative heat stabilities; (ii) differential bactericidal activity versus B. subtilis and Micrococcus luteus; and (iii) SDS-PAGE protein profiles. These data show that the bioactive PMP protein moiety is of low MW, is heat stable, is probably cationic (similar to leukocyte-derived defensins), and possesses potent bactericidal activity against a significant percentage of S. aureus isolates.
TI  - Location of peptidoglycan and teichoic acid on the cell wall surface of Staphylococcus aureus as determined by immunoelectron microscopy.
AB  - Anti-peptidoglycan (PG) and anti-teichoic acid (TA) antibodies were prepared from sera of rabbits immunized with the cell wall fraction of Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I by the specific adsorption technique with purified teichoic acid or peptidoglycan. The anti-PG antibody recognized the trichloroacetic acid-treated walls (TCA wall) prepared from S. aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Micrococcus luteus but did not react with teichoic acid or proteins extracted from the cell wall of Staphylococcus. The anti-TA antibody specifically reacted with cell wall teichoic acid of beta-type sugar configuration. The reaction sites of these antibodies on the cell wall of S. aureus Wood 46 were determined by immunoelectron microscopy using colloidal gold as a probe. The anti-TA antibody reacted mostly with the fibrous electron-dense mass on the cell surface. The reaction was also seen on the inner surface of the cell wall. The anti-PG antibody reacted with the fibrous structures and also directly on the cell wall surface. The distribution of the probes on the cell wall surface examined with the scanning electron microscope showed that there was no localized distribution in respect to the cell division. We knew from these observations that the external surface of the cell wall of Staphylococcus is covered with the fibrous mass which consists mostly of teichoic acid but partially of peptidoglycan.
TI  - The occurrence and growth of microorganisms during the fermentation of fish sausage.
AB  - Minced fish (mullet) sausage mixes containing added sugar, salt, nitrate, nitrite and spices were fermented (48 h, 30 degrees C) by indigenous flora or by a starter culture (Pediococcus acidilactici) and the microbial ecology and behaviour of various bacteria was monitored. Pediococcus pentosaceus and Lactobacillus plantarum dominated the indigenous fermentation, achieving populations of 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g by 48 h, and decreasing the pH of the mix to 4.5-4.7. Significant growth (10(5)-10(7) cfu/g) of Staphylococcus warneri, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis. Micrococcus varians and Micrococcus luteus also occurred during this fermentation. Less growth was exhibited by Bacillus megaterium and yeasts. Pediococcus acidilactici dominated the fermentation when it was inoculated as a starter culture, but indigenous lactic acid bacteria (P. pentosaceus and L. plantarum) also grew to 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g. The growth of other bacteria and yeasts was restricted during fermentation with starter culture. Inoculated Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella sofia, and Staphylococcus aureus grew to 10(6)-10(7) cfu/g in the sausage mix during indigenous fermentation. Lesser growth occurred for Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Growth of these bacteria was significantly inhibited in sausage mix fermented with P. acidilactici.
TI  - [Value of the technique of cellular lysis by thermic shock in the isolation of bacteria causing osteoarticular infections].
AB  - The purpose of this work is to compare, a conventional technique, for bacterial isolation, with a lysis-centrifugation method using a rapid freezing in liquid nitrogen, followed by decongelation at 37 degrees C for bone and joint samples. The bone and joint specimens were biopsies and punctions (35 cases) or fistula (10 cases). The residual antibiotic activity of the sample was determined using a susceptible strain of Micrococcus luteus and of Staphylococcus epidermidis. Among the 45 samples, 20 were sterile with both methods among which 8 exhibited a residual antibiotic activity which may have contributed to isolation failure. In 12 cases, bacterial isolates were obtained with both methods. Cultures were obtained from 13 samples with the lysis centrifugation method alone. The isolates were 4 Staphylococcus aureus, 8 coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and 1 Acinetobacter sp. These results suggest that the intracellular location of bacteria may be responsible for the negative cultures from bone or joint specimens.
TI  - Effects of high hydrostatic pressure on characteristics of pork slurries and inactivation of microorganisms associated with meat and meat products.
AB  - Pork slurries inoculated with various test microorganisms were prepared and subjected to high hydrostatic pressure at 1000 to 6000 atm for 10 min at 25 degrees C to examine for the pressure effects on characteristics of the slurries and the inactivation of the microorganisms associated with meat and meat products. Pressure treatment at higher than 3000 atm caused coagulation and discoloration of the pork slurries. Harder and more white coagulants were obtained by increasing the pressure. Pressure treatment at 3000 to 6000 atm killed all the microorganisms tested by more than 6-log colony-forming units (cfu)/g except Bacillus cereus spores. Gram-negative microorganisms were more labile to pressure than Gram-positive ones. Campylobacter jejuni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium and Yersinia enterocolitica were inactivated at pressures higher than 3000 atm; Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida utilis at pressures higher than 4000 atm; Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis at 6000 atm. Only less than one-log cfu/g of B. cereus spores were inactivated at 6000 atm. Ultraviolet absorption spectra and acridine orange staining suggested that E. coli became permeable and leaked cytoplasmic RNA at lower pressure than S. aureus. From the present findings, the authors propose high hydrostatic pressure treatment as a promising means of preparing wholesome meat and meat products.
TI  - Purification of equine neutrophil lysozyme and its antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Lysozyme from equine neutrophil granulocytes was isolated in a pure form by fast  performance liquid chromatography, i.e. ion-exchange chromatography and reversed-phase chromatography. The lysozyme lysed Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus lentus and was also bactericidal against the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bordetella bronchiseptica, and Serratia marcescens. Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were not lysed. The lysozyme was only very slightly bactericidal for S. epidermidis and S. aureus. Equine neutrophil lysozyme was found to be bactericidal for Gram-positive as well as for Gram-negative bacteria without further treatment. Equine and chicken egg white lysozymes were found to be immunologically related when examined using specific antisera against each of them. Both lysozymes also had very similar specific enzymatic activities against M. luteus membranes.
TI  - Characterization of sodium dodecyl sulfate-stable Staphylococcus aureus bacteriolytic enzymes by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  - Profiles of the bacteriolytic activities of Staphylococcus aureus culture supernatants, sodium dodecyl sulfate cell extracts, LiCl cell extracts, cell wall extracts, and cell membranes were analyzed in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels containing Micrococcus luteus or S. aureus. A total of 20 distinct bands of bacteriolytic activity could be detected in gels containing M. luteus, 8 of these bands were found in culture supernatants. The sodium dodecyl sulfate cell extracts, the LiCl cell extracts, and the cell membranes each contained 20 bands (P1 to P20), but no activity was found in cell wall extracts. Less bacteriolytic activity could be detected in gels containing S. aureus, although three bands were found in culture supernatants and LiCl extracts and cell membranes contained one major band, P13. Crude cell extracts showed five bacteriolytic bands of which the major bacteriolytic bands were distributed in an identical manner in all 10 strains of S. aureus studied. The effects of chemical and physical factors were determined, and it was shown that iodoacetic acid, Hg2+, and Cibacron Blue 3G-A reduced activity, and an optimum pH for enzyme detection was between 7 and 8. Preincubation at 100 degrees C for 30 min reduced the activity of P1 and P2 bands.
TI  - [Studies of antigens related to metabolic and growth inhibitions of Staphylococcus aureus L-form].
AB  - Metabolic and growth inhibiting activities in immunoglobulin (of anti-S. aureus L-form serum and anti-S. aureus coccal form serum) could be absorbed by cell membranes of S. aureus L-form and its coccal form, respectively. These activities could not be absorbed by cell membrane of Micrococcus luteus, Streptococcus pyogenes or Actinomyces viscosus. These findings suggested the existence of species-specific antigens of cell membrane. The membrane antigens of L-form related to the metabolic and growth inhibiting activities were stable to trypsin, heating and periodate, and were not solubilized by trypsin. A large part of the antigen in a typsin-insoluble membrane precipitate of L-form could be extracted by acetone and the subsequent use of chloroform-methanol (2: 1). A fractionation study of chloroform-methanol extract by using silicic acid calum indicated that more than two components were involved in metabolic and growth inhibiting activities.
TI  - Purification of a 51 kDa endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase from Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - A bacteriolytic enzyme obtained from the culture fluid of Staphylococcus aureus FDA 209P was purified to homogeneity utilizing dye-ligand affinity column chromatography, hydrophobic interaction high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and hydroxyapatite HPLC. Subsequent characterizations indicated that the purified enzyme acted as endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase. The molecular weight determined by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was 51,000 and the isoelectric point was higher than 10. The optimum pH for the enzyme activity on whole cells of Micrococcus luteus as a substrate was 8.0. Some heavy metal cations (Cu2+ and Zn2+) inhibited the enzyme activity at a concentration of 0.1 mM and others (Ba2+, Mg2+ and Co2+) showed a stimulating effect at a concentration of 1 mM.
TI  - Detection of bacterial cell wall hydrolases after denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  - Cell walls from various Gram-positive bacteria were incorporated at a concentration of 0.2% (w/v) into polyacrylamide gels as a substrate for detection of cell wall hydrolases. Bacterial extracts from crude cell wall preparations were denatured with sodium dodecyl sulfate and 2-mercaptoethanol and subjected to denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in gels containing bacterial cell walls. After renaturation in the presence of purified and buffered 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, cell wall hydrolases were visualized as clear lytic zones against the opaque cell wall background. One to fifteen bands with lytic activity could be detected, depending on bacterial extracts and on the nature of the cell walls incorporated into gels. Crude cell wall extracts were the best source of cell wall hydrolases from various Gram-positive bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens (15 bands), Micrococcus luteus (1 band), Bacillus megaterium (4 bands), Bacillus sp. (6 bands), B. cereus (3 bands), B. subtilis (7 bands), Staphylococcus aureus (13 bands), Streptococcus faecalis (3 bands), and Strep. pyogenes (5 bands). Molecular masses of cell wall hydrolases ranged from 17 to 114.6 kDa. Lytic activities against cell walls of Corynebacterium sepedonicum (Clavibacter michiganense pv. sepedonicum) could be shown with the cell wall extracts of Strep. pyogenes (45.7 kDa), Strep. faecalis (67 kDa), B. megaterium (67 kDa), and Staph. aureus (67 kDa).
TI  - [Antibacterial spectrum of lisosubtilin G10X].
AB  - Data on the antibacterial spectrum of lysosubtilin G10X, a preparation of lytic enzymes from Bacillus subtilis SK-52 are presented. Lysosubtilin was active against grampositive and gramnegative pathogenic bacteria. When it was used as a substrate of live lyophilized microbial cells the highest lysis levels were observed in B. brevis, B. cereus, B. pumilis, B. subtilis and S. faecalis. Preincubation of the substrate in acid media mainly increased the levels of the lysis by enzyme preparation. Sometimes the increase was very high (B. sphaericus, B. subtilis 720, E. coli K12 and MRE-600). Such a preincubation provided cell lysis in some strains not liable to the effect of lysosubtilin (B. cereus 1312, C. renale, M. luteus, S. aureus KP, 800, 805 and 126001, S. pyogenes 291). An increase in the lysosubtilin concentration in the reaction mixture in the majority of the cases did not provide favourable results. However, some strains resistant to the preparation at a concentration of 1000 units/ml were lysed with its 10 times higher doses. An increase in the lysis level was also achieved with increasing the time of the incubation with the enzyme preparation. Proceeding from the preparation antibacterial spectrum it is possible to recommend it for treatment of diseases in agricultural animals. Its use in veterinary was a success.
TI  - Characteristic bacteriolytic activities of Staphylococcus hyicus.
AB  - Staphylococcus hyicus demonstrated characteristic bacteriolytic activities towards a Micrococcus luteus reference strain. This lytic activity was demonstrated on medium containing M. luteus cells as large zones of transparency around the culture streak. Smaller zones of transparency were observed with Staphylococcus intermedius, Staphylococcus chromogenes, and some strains of Staphylococcus aureus but not with other coagulase-negative staphylococcal species. The distribution and extent of the bacteriolytic activity could be useful as additional criteria for differentiation of S. hyicus.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of cervical mucus in pregnant or non-pregnant women].
AB  - Antibacterial activities of human cervical mucus obtained from non-pregnant and pregnant women were tested using standard blood agar plates. The combined effect of cervical mucus with cefmetazole (CMZ) was also investigated. Obtained results are summarized as follows. 1. Cervical mucus specimens obtained from 6 subjects at 9 to 36 weeks of pregnancy showed antibacterial activity to only one strain of Bacillus subtilis among organisms tested. The cervical mucus enhanced the activity of CMZ against 1 strain of Streptococcus pyogenes and 2 strains of Micrococcus luteus, but no effect was observed against other organisms tested. 2. Cervical mucus specimens obtained from non-pregnant women showed antibacterial activities to 8 of 11 strains (72.7%) of B. subtilis tested. The cervical mucus enhanced the activities of CMZ against 1 strain of S. pyogenes and 3 strains of B. subtilis. The tested organisms included Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, S. pyogenes, B. subtilis, M. luteus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Candida albicans, but, as described above, cervical mucus samples showed antimicrobial activities only against B. subtilis (9/17, 52.9%), and specimens obtained only from non-pregnant women or pregnant women with less than 11 weeks of pregnancy showed any antimicrobial activities.
TI  - [Comparison of solubility between cell membranes of Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus (lysodeikticus) with various detergents].
AB  
TI  - Coupling products of amino acids to penicillin V and cephalothin: synthesis and susceptibility to carboxypeptidases and lysosomal enzymes.
AB  - Amino acids have been coupled to the carboxyl group of penicillin V and cephalothin by methods that keep the beta-lactam ring intact. Derivatives were successfully obtained with both neutral (Leu, Val, Ala, Ile, Trp, Tyr, Gly) and one acidic (Glu) amino acids. The new compounds were inactive in vitro against Staphylococcus aureus or Micrococcus luteus. Incubation in the presence of purified carboxypeptidases (A, B), soluble lysosomal fractions from liver, or cellular homogenates from liver, kidney, fibroblasts, and macrophages did not allow recovery of the antibacterial activity. Injection in mice also failed to cause liberation of microbiologically active compounds. HPLC studies confirmed that the amide linkage between the antibiotic and the amino acid was not hydrolyzed in the presence of soluble lysosomal fractions from liver. However, conversion of cephalothin and cephalothin-leucine to desacetyl derivatives was observed in the presence of soluble lysosomal fractions and extracts from liver and semipurified orange peel acetylesterase(s). It is concluded that amino acid derivatives of beta-lactam antibiotics do not offer potential chemotherapeutic use as prodrugs.
TI  - No effect of oral N-acetylcysteine on the bioavailability of erythromycin and bacampicillin.
AB  - In vitro studies with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) solutions used for inhalation treatment have demonstrated inactivation of some antibiotics by NAC. Oral NAC treatment is increasingly common for long-term prophylaxis in chronic bronchitis. During exacerbations, treatment with oral antibiotics will often be given simultaneously. We assessed the effect of simultaneous oral administration of NAC on the bioavailability of two antibiotics in ten healthy volunteers. No effect of NAC was found on the bioavailability of ampicillin, after administration of the prodrug bacampicillin. A slight, but not significant statistical increase in erythromycin serum levels was seen with NAC. Acetylator phenotype did not influence the absorption of NAC, which seemed slightly reduced by bacampicillin, but significantly increased by erythromycin. No decrease of antibacterial activity of sera was found in vitro after the addition of NAC or the related thiol glutathione, employing micrococcus luteus and staphylococcus aureus as indicator organisms.
TI  - [Action of thomicide on bacterial cells. The membranotropic activity of thomicide].
AB  - It was shown that a combined drug thomicide impaired permeability of cell membranes in Micrococcus luteus 2665 and Staphylococcus aureus 209P inducing production of substances with the absorption maxima at 260 nm. Active lysis of the M. luteus 2665 protoplasts under the action of thomicide used in a dose of at least 60 micrograms per 1 mg of the protoplast proteins was observed. Thomicide inhibited oxidation of the substrates by intact cells of the staphylococci and micrococci. Respiration of the micrococcal protoplasts was inhibited by thomicide in concentrations inducing lysis of the protoplasts. Impairment of function and the state of the membranes of the bacterial cells (production of compounds with the absorption maxima at 260 nm, protoplast lysis and respiration inhibition) was recorded at thomicide concentrations lower than the bactericidal ones. The membranotropic activity of thomicide was associated with thermostable component of the complex.
TI  - [Effect of metabolites on the human plasma concentration as total activity after  oral administration of rokitamycin. Comparison of three different bioassay methods].
AB  - Three different bioassay methods for rokitamycin (TMS-19-Q) were compared to each other in vitro and in vivo. Method I was a paper disc method using Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341 as the test organism in nutrient agar (pH 8.0), method II was a paper disc method using Streptococcus pyogenes Cook in brain heart infusion agar (pH 7.4) and method III was an agar well method using M. luteus ATCC 9341 in the agar medium provided in the Minimum Requirements for Antibiotic Products of Japan (pH 6.5). Ratios of relative potency of TMS-19-Q and its metabolites calculated from standard curves in human plasma using these bioassay methods, were 1.00:1.13:3.34:0.96 (TMS-19-Q:10"-OH-TMS-19-Q:LM A7:LM V) in method I, 1.00:1.58:0.40 (TMS-19-Q:LM A7:LM V) in method II and 1.00:0.51:0.86:0.114 (TMS-19-Q:10"-OH-TMS-19-Q:LM A7:LM V) in method III. The relative potency obtained from method I, generally used for macrolide antibiotics, greatly contradicted MIC values of TMS-19-Q and its metabolites against clinically isolated 190 strains of Staphylococcus aureus. On the other hand, the relative potency obtained from method III reflected closely MIC values of TMS-19-Q and its metabolites. Therefore, method III should be the most suitable bioassay method to measure the plasma concentration of TMS-19-Q. Plasma concentrations measured by these 3 different methods were compared to each other in vivo, after oral administration of TMS-19-Q at a dose of 1,200 mg to each of fasted healthy volunteers. Values obtained from method I were about 4.3 times higher than those method III.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Analysis of cell division gene ftsZ (sulB) from gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The ftsZ (sulB) gene of Escherichia coli codes for a 40,000-dalton protein that carries out a key step in the cell division pathway. The presence of an ftsZ gene protein in other bacterial species was examined by a combination of Southern blot and Western blot analyses. Southern blot analysis of genomic restriction digests revealed that many bacteria, including species from six members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Agrobacterium tumefaciens, contained sequences which hybridized with an E. coli ftsZ probe. Genomic DNA from more distantly related bacteria, including Bacillus subtilis, Branhamella catarrhalis, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus, did not hybridize under minimally stringent conditions. Western blot analysis, with anti-E. coli FtsZ antiserum, revealed that all bacterial species examined contained a major immunoreactive band. Several of the Enterobacteriaceae were transformed with a multicopy plasmid encoding the E. coli ftsZ gene. These transformed strains, Shigella sonnei, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes, were shown to overproduce the FtsZ protein and to produce minicells. Analysis of [35S]methionine-labeled minicells revealed that the plasmid-encoded gene products were the major labeled species. This demonstrated that the E. coli ftsZ gene could function in other bacterial species to induce minicells and that these minicells could be used to analyze plasmid-endoced gene products.
TI  - [Isolation and characteristics of an antibacterial substance produced by a strain of Streptococcus sp. Thom-1606. A study of the biological activity of the metabolic products of Streptococcus sp. Thom-1606].
AB  - The data on the biological properties of the culture fluid of Streptococcus strain sp. TOM-1606 are presented. The native preparation has been shown to possess the capacity for stimulating the rate of the clearance of the peritoneal cavity of mice from Staphylococcus aureus cells, strain MT-1, rif. r., found to be insensitive to the action of the above-mentioned preparation in vitro. The crude preparation produces a transitory bacteriostatic effect on the streptococcal and staphylococcal strains under study. The preparation produces a prolonged bacteriostatic effect only on Micrococcus luteus test strain. All these data suggest that the crude preparation contains at least two active principles.
TI  - Clinical evaluation of teicoplanin for therapy of severe infections caused by gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Teicoplanin was evaluated in 47 patients with severe infections, including 14 patients with bone infections, 11 patients with soft-tissue infections, 7 patients with endocarditis, 5 patients with pneumonia, 3 patients with septic thrombophlebitis, 3 patients with septicemia of unknown origin, and 4 patients with miscellaneous infections. Overall, bacteremia was documented in 24 patients. The pathogens isolated were 35 strains of Staphylococcus aureus (including 8 methicillin-resistant strains), 4 strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, 4 strains of Streptococcus faecalis, 2 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 5 strains of other streptococci, and 1 Micrococcus luteus strain. A total of 22 patients (46.8%) were clinically cured, 8 patients (17.0%) improved, 2 patients (4.3%) had relapses after initial improvement, and 15 patients (31.9%) failed to respond. The results were better in nonbacteremic patients (19 of 23 patients [82.6%] were cured or improved) than in patients with bacteremia (12 of 24 patients [50%] were cured or improved). Bacteriological cure occurred in 25 patients (53.2%), and superinfections were documented in 6 patients (12.8%). No major adverse effects were observed. We conclude that teicoplanin is a potentially effective and well-tolerated antimicrobial agent for therapy of nonbacteremic infections caused by gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - [Antibacterial properties of some spice plants before and after heat treatment].
AB  - This study was carried out to understand the antibacterial properties of some spice plants before and after heat treatment in boiling water. The samples included the core and the outer layers of onion, the white and the green parts of green onion, garlic bulb, ginger, ginger root, sweet pepper, chili pepper, brown pepper, and mustard. The test microorganisms included Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycobacterium phlei, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, and Micrococcus luteus. Raw garlic bulb could inhibit all of the test strains. The antibacterial activities of green onion are slightly weak than that of onion. However, green onion could inhibit P. aeruginosa and M. luteus, but onion could inhibit E. coli, P. vulgaris, S. faecalis, and B. cereus. Ginger and ginger root could only inhibit M. luteus. Chili pepper could inhibit V. parahaemolyticus and P. vulgaris. Brown pepper could also inhibit P. vulgaris. Sweet pepper and mustard showed no antibacterial activity to all of the test strains. In general, antibacterial components in the spice plants were heat labile. All the spices tested lost their antibacterial activities within 20 min at 100 degrees C.
TI  - [Reactivity to bacterial peptidoglycans in a phagocytosis system. The range of immunological specificity of Escherichia coli peptidoglycan].
AB  - The antigenic specificity of E. coli M17 peptidoglycans (PG) was studied in the test system based on the stimulation of neutrophils with PG opsonized with the whole and exhausted IgG fraction of human serum. Within the generic taxon, the PG under study were similar in their antigenic properties. The opsonic activity of IgG exhausted with the preparations of different E. coli strains decreased by 93.2-95.8%. An essential difference of E. coli PG from similar components of other representatives of the family Enterobacteriaceae was observed: in experiments with Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus rettgeri the decrease of opsonic activity was 47.6-79.3%. After the removal of antibodies to PG of remote taxons (Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, Branchamella catarrhalis) the decrease of the opsonic effect was less noticeable (9.7-33.8%). The results are discussed from the viewpoint of the immunological peculiarity of PG at different taxonomic levels.
TI  - Effect of saccharin on growth and acid production of glucose-grown pathogenic and oral bacteria.
AB  - Growth and acid production of glucose-grown Gram-positive and Gram-negative rods  as well as cocci from the human oral cavity were studied in the presence of 0.02 to 20.00 mg/ml sodium saccharin. All Gram-positive rods, i.e. Actinomyces viscosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bacillus subtilis and Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and Gram-positive cocci, i.e. Streptococcus spp, Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus, were significantly inhibited by saccharin, especially at the higher concentrations. While Gram-negative cocci, i.e. Veillonella sp and Neisseria sicca were strongly inhibited by all tested saccharin concentrations, Gram-negative rods, i.e. the enterics and Acinetobacter sp, exhibited little if any inhibition. Saccharin caused a significant reduction in fermentative acid production congruent with observed growth.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of sugar osazones and anhydro sugars.
AB  - The antimicrobial effect of 14 sugar osazones and anhydro sugars was studied with model strains of Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus licheniformis, Escherichia coli and strains Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from clinical material. The relationship between the structure of these compounds, their solubility in water and 1-octanol and antimicrobial effect was investigated.
TI  - Wheat germ agglutinin potentiates uptake of bacteria by murine peritoneal macrophages.
AB  - Exposure of thioglycollate-elicited murine peritoneal macrophages to wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) increased markedly the uptake of six different bacteria, which have surface receptors for the lectin. Uptake of Staphylococcus aureus H was higher by 3-5-fold, of S. aureus 52A2 by 1.8-fold, of S. aureus 52A5 by 1.7-fold, of S. albus by 2.3-fold, of Shigella flexneri by 6-fold and of Micrococcus luteus by 6.5-fold. Klebsiella pneumoniae, devoid of receptors for WGA, was not phagocytosed following pretreatment of macrophages with the lectin. Pretreatment of the bacteria with the lectin also resulted, in most cases, in an increase in phagocytosis. Interaction of WGA with the macrophages and with the bacteria, as well as the potentiation of phagocytosis, was abolished by tri-N-acetylchitotriose, a saccharide that binds specifically to WGA, but not by monosaccharides which do not interact with this lectin. With non-elicited macrophages, enhancement of phagocytosis by WGA was less pronounced, probably because of the higher number of lectin-binding sites (5-fold) on the elicited cells. Peanut agglutinin and soybean agglutinin, that bind to macrophages but not to the bacteria studied, lack the ability to potentiate phagocytosis. Macrophage surface sugars thus appear to play an important role in phagocytosis by serving as receptors for lectins that form bridges between the macrophages and the microorganisms.
TI  - Secondary structure and phylogeny of Staphylococcus and Micrococcus 5S rRNAs.
AB  - Nucleotide sequences of 5S rRNAs from four bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus Smith  (diffuse), Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 14990, Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341 and Micrococcus luteus ATCC 4698, were determined. The secondary structural models of S. aureus and S. epidermidis sequences showed characteristics of the gram-positive bacterial 5S rRNA (116-N type [H. Hori and S. Osawa, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 76:381-385, 1979]). Those of M. luteus ATCC 9341 and M. luteus ATCC 4698 together with that of Streptomyces griseus (A. Simoncsits, Nucleic Acids Res. 8:4111-4124, 1980) showed intermediary characteristics between the gram-positive and gram-negative (120-N type [H. Hori and S. Osawa, 1979]) 5S rRNAs. This and previous studies revealed that there exist at least three major groups of eubacteria having distinct 5S rRNA and belonging to different stems in the 5S rRNA phylogenic tree.
TI  - [Reactivity to bacterial peptidoglycans in a phagocytosis system. 1. The range of immunological specificity of Staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan].
AB  - The antigenic features of S. aureus peptidoglycan (PG) were studied in the reaction of stimulation of oxygen-dependent neutrophil metabolism, mediated by the IgG opsonins of normal human serum. The study was carried out at different taxonomic levels: the species (S. aureus), the genus (Staphylococcus), the family (Micrococcaceae), as well as in relation to remote taxons (organisms belonging to the families Streptococcaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Neisseriaceae, to the genus Corynebacterium). All S. aureus strains were identical with respect to the specificity of their PG, essentially differing from other bacteria in this regard. After the removal of antibodies to different PG the effectiveness of PG opsonization decreased by 10.4-44.7%. Such decrease was most pronounced in experiments with the PG of streptococci (S. pyogenes, S. faecalis, S. salivarius) and Micrococcus luteus.
TI  - Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus peptidoglycan transglycosylases that are not penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  - Major peptidoglycan transglycosylase activities, which synthesize uncross-linked  peptidoglycan from lipid-linked precursors, were solubilized from the membranes of Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus and were partially purified. The transglycosylase activities were separated from penicillin-binding proteins by solubilization and by purification steps. Therefore, we concluded that these activities were not activities of the penicillin-binding proteins, which are the presumptive peptidoglycan transpeptidases in these gram-positive cocci. Unlike Escherichia coli, in which the network structure of peptidoglycan is synthesized by multiple two-headed penicillin-binding proteins with both transpeptidase and transglycosylase activities, these gram-positive cocci have cell wall peptidoglycan which seems to be synthesized by penicillin-binding protein transpeptidases and a separate transglycosylase.
TI  - New streptothricin-group antibiotics, AN-201 I and II. Screening, fermentation, isolation, structure and biological activity.
AB  - Two streptothricin-group antibiotics, AN-201 I and II, were newly discovered and  isolated from the culture broth of Streptomyces nojiriensis C-13. These antibiotics were purified by IRC-50 (H+) and CM-Sephadex C-50 chromatography, and paper electrophoresis. Structural analysis of AN-201 I and II showed that they were N beta-acetylated derivatives of streptothricin E and D, respectively. They had antibacterial activities against several strains of Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus aureus, and showed a strong selective cytotoxic effect on 3T3 cells transformed with SV-40 as compared with their normal cells in a test system in vitro as well as in vivo.
TI  - [Antifungal and antimicrobial activity of beta-ionone and vitamin A derivatives].
AB  - The antifungal and antimicrobic activity of some derivatives of beta-ionon and vitamin A was studied. These compounds (citral, pseudo-ionon. beta-ionon aldehyde C14, ketone C18 and its derivatives--4,18-diketone, alcohol C18, semicarbazide ketone C18), as well as vitamin A and its derivatives--retinal, acetate, retinoic acid--differ in composition, structure and substituents of C-atoms in beta-ionon ring and in polyenoic chain. Fusarium solani, Botrytis cenerea and Verticillum dahliae II, race 447 were used as test organisms when studying the antifungal activity. When studying the antimicrobic activity, ketone C18 and alcohol C18 were tested using the museum strains Staphylococcus aureus 209 P, hemolytic Streptococcus pyogenes FF-38, Streptococcus sp. TOM-1606, Micrococcus luteus 2665, as well as the strains Staphylococcus aureus isolated from pyoderma patients. The antifungal activity was determined by inhibition of spore germination, and the antimicrobic activity--by the value of areas of growth inhibition of the test organisms on the agar medium. All the compounds mentioned above possessed the antifungal activity against all the phytopathogenes used. The degree of this activity depends on the composition and structure of both the cyclic part and polyenoic chain. on the number of conjugated unsaturations, substituents and end groups of C-atom. Ketone C18 is the most active one. It inhibits spore germination by 100-94% at concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 0.005% and 24 h exposure, and by 100% at the concentration of 0.1% and 72 h exposure. Alcohol C18 possesses almost the same antifungul activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Biochemical and physical properties of the endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidases from Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus simulans, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus.
AB  - Biochemical and physical properties of the pure bacteriolytic enzymes excreted by three different Staphylococcus species (S. aureus, S. simulans, and S. saprophyticus) were investigated. Although the three enzymes have previously been shown to share the same specificity of action (endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity), their biochemical features clearly indicated that they were three different enzymes, confirming what had previously been suggested by the different lytic-activity patterns displayed by each species and the different procedures needed to achieve purification of each enzyme. Very different values resulted from molecular weight determination: 80,000 for the S. aureus enzyme, 45,000 for the S. simulans enzyme and 31,000 for the S. saprophyticus enzyme. Other important differences were observed in their kinetics of activity on Micrococcus luteus purified cell walls; their stability; their bacteriolytic spectrum against heat-killed cells of various microorganisms; and their response to physical and chemical factors, such as temperature, pH, ionic strength, divalent cations, chelating agents, thiol compounds, and glucose derivatives.
TI  - Microbiological investigations on cryopreserved human semen.
AB  - Primary mycological contamination was studied in 565 random human ejaculates. After sperm preservation at low temperature, secondary mycological contamination of 55 of the ejaculates was investigated. 25 ejaculates were cryopreserved with and without antibiotics and examined bacteriologically before and after different phases of cryopreservation. Furthermore, semen samples of several donors were inoculated with suspensions of different concentrations of yeasts and with the test bacteria Escherichia coli K 12 and Staphylococcus aureus SG 511. Microbiological results were then compared before and after cryopreservation. The following results were obtained: 1.9.8% of samples showed primary mycological contamination (1.9% with Candida albicans). 2. Cryopreservation reduced the concentration of fungi by more than 90% on average. 3. Only one semen sample was contaminated with bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus haemolyticus and Streptococcus nonhaemolyticus). Non-pathogenic bacteria were found in 11 ejaculates (Micrococcus luteus in 5 samples and Staphylococcus epidermidis in 6 samples), and contamination was largely unaffected by cryopreservation, even in the presence of antibiotics. 4. Test bacteria inoculated into semen were not influenced by the addition of antibiotics to the cryoprotective medium.
TI  - [Effect of antibiotic AL-87 on the fatty acid composition of microorganisms in different taxonomic groups].
AB  - The effect of antibiotic A1-87 on the fatty acid composition of S. aureus 209, E. coli O26 and M. luteus 169 significantly differing in this property was studied. The sub-bacteriostatic doses of the preparation induced the appearance of unsaturated fatty acids in S. aureus 209. These acids were not detected in the control cultures. They also significantly increased the content of the saturated branched fatty acid with 15 carbon atoms in this culture and decreased the content of the fatty acid of the same type with 19 carbon atoms. In E. coli O25 there was an almost two-fold increase in the content of the unsaturated straight chain fatty acids with a respective decrease in the content of cyclopropanoic acid and a markedly pronounced decrease in the content of nonadecanoic acid. In M. luteus 169 the content of the saturated branched fatty acid with 15 carbon atoms increased, while the content of the unsaturated straight chain fatty acids (C16:1, C18:1) decreased, the content of hexadecanoic acid being decreased almost two times. According to the present status the differences in the fatty acid composition of the above organisms are interpreted as one of the mechanisms increasing the membrane permeability.
TI  - Effects of nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide on bacterial growth.
AB  - The effects of low concentrations of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on actively dividing cultures of Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Micrococcus roseus, Serratia marcescens, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus circulans, Bacillus megaterium, and Bacillus cereus were studied. Fresh cultures of each organism were incubated for 24 h at 25 degrees C on both nutrient agar and mineral salts glucose agar plates under atmospheres containing various low concentrations of NO in air (0 to 1.9 ppm [0 to 2.0 micrograms/g of air]), NO2 in air (0 to 5.5 ppm [0 to 8.8 micrograms/g of air]), or NO and NO2 in air. Bacteria grown under air only were used as controls. After incubation, the colonies that developed on the plates were counted. None of the bacteria tested was affected by NO or NO2 at the indicated concentrations while growing on nutrient agar. Serratia marcescens, B. circulans, B. subtilis, B. megaterium, and B. cereus grown on mineral salts glucose agar were not significantly affected by NO or NO2. Low concentrations (0 to 1.9 ppm) of NO were bacteriostatic to log-phase cultures of M. roseus, M. luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus grown on mineral salts glucose agar. Bacteriostatic activity over a 24-h interval was maximal at an initial NO concentration of 1 ppm. Appreciable amounts of NO2 were produced in 24 h at initial NO concentrations greater than 1 ppm. These results suggest that NO2 may reduce the bacteriostatic activity of NO. Low concentrations (0 to 5.5 ppm) of NO2 in air did not affect any of the bacteria tested. At these low concentrations, NO affected bacterial growth, although NO2, NO2-, and NO3- did not. In addition, it was determined that the bacteriostatic activity observed in this study was not due to an increase in the acidity of the medium.
TI  - Lack of influence of commonly used drugs on bioassay indicator organisms.
AB  - Many commonly used pharmaceutical agents have been found to inhibit bacterial growth in vitro. Determinations of antimicrobial concentrations in sera of patients taking nonrecognized antibacterial agents could possibly be altered if bioassay systems are utilized for the determinations. We therefore attempted to determine the in vitro effect of commonly used drugs on bioassay indicator organisms. Fifty-one different agents (antihistamines, anticholinergics, central nervous system agents, cardiovascular agents, analgesics, steroids, muscle blockers, and other miscellaneous agents) were tested for inhibition or enhancement of the growth of Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. None of the agents tested exhibited any effect on standard in vitro bioassay organisms. Nortriptyline hydrochloride inhibited the growth of B. subtilis and M. luteus at a concentration of 500 micrograms/ml (zones of inhibition, 14 and 13 mm, respectively), but no inhibition was observed with concentrations of 50 micrograms/ml or lower.
TI  - Purification and characterization of three separate bacteriolytic enzymes excreted by Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus simulans, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus.
AB  - As a further development of previous investigations showing that different staphylococcal species display different bacteriolytic activity patterns (lyogroups), the bacteriolytic enzymes excreted by three different Staphylococcus species, Staphylococcus aureus (lyogroup I), S. simulans (lyogroup II), and S. saprophyticus (lyogroup IV); have been purified and characterized. A representative strain from each species was grown in a preselected medium made of fully dialyzable products. Culture supernatants were collected in the appropriate growth phase. Two different affinity adsorbents were used for enzyme purification. One was obtained by coupling lysozyme-digested pure peptidoglycan from Micrococcus luteus to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B. The second affinity adsorbent used was chitin. The S. aureus bacteriolytic enzyme bound to the solubilized peptidoglycan but not to chitin, whereas the opposite was true for the S. simulans enzyme. The bacteriolytic enzyme from S. saprophyticus did not bind to either the Sepharose 4B-peptidoglycan resin or to chitin, and its purification was achieved by two ion-exchange chromatography steps combined with gel filtration. All three enzymes were purified to apparent homogeneity. Their subsequent characterization indicated that all acted as endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidases. However, the three glucosaminidases differed significantly in their kinetics of activity and bacteriolytic spectrum against heat-killed cells of a variety of microorganisms. Very different values also resulted from molecular weight determinations: 80,000 for the S. aureus enzyme, 45,000 for the S. simulans enzyme, and 31,000 for the S. saprophyticus enzyme. Other important differences were observed in their stability, optimal pH and ionic strength for their activity, and their responses to temperature and divalent cations. These results confirmed the previous proposal that different staphylococcal species excrete different lytic enzymes.
TI  - Antimicrobial characteristic of insoluble alkylpyridinium iodide.
AB  - Insoluble and soluble alkylpyridinium iodides (C8 to C18) were synthesized. The insoluble agents were quaternized 4-vinylpyridine-divinylbenzene copolymers. The insoluble agent [C12(50)] that contained 50% divinylbenzene and had a C12 alkyl chain was selected as the most suitable insoluble agent. C12(50) showed poor durability of the antibacterial activity, but C12(50), which had lost the activity, was refreshed by washing with ethanol. This washing became ineffective after a few cycles of antibacterial treatment and refreshment. Such C12(50) recovered the activity upon 1.0 N NaOH treatment. The antibacterial activity of C12(50) depended on its surface area. It showed high antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria and also showed activity against gram-negative bacteria and yeasts. But the activities of C12(50) and laurylpyridinium iodide solution were different against some microbes. The antibacterial activities of the agents were investigated against Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus under various conditions. The activity of C12(50) was higher at a higher temperature or at a lower cell concentration. The activity of C12(50) decreased on addition of NaCl, glucose, or bovine albumin to the cell suspension or in 0.01 M sodium-potassium phosphate buffer. C12(50) showed less activity when cells were mixed with dead cells or the supernatant of dead cells killed in an autoclave. The mode of action of the laurylpyridinium iodide solution against E. coli and M. luteus was similar to that of C12(50) except for the influence of E. coli cell concentration.
TI  - Characterization of the lysozyme of Mytilus edulis (L).
AB  - 1. Lysozyme isolated from the crystalline style of Mytilus edulis is a true N-acetylmuramyl-hydrolase (E.C. 3.2.1.17). 2. THe enzyme is optimally active at approx pH 7.1, I = 0.011, with a secondary optimum at pH 4.6, I = 0.054. 3. Cell walls of Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus subtilis were degraded by the lysozyme but chitin or cell walls of Staphylococcus aureus were resistant to its activity. 4. Tetra-N-acetyl chitotetraose inhibited enzyme activity more than N-acetylglucosamine, di-N-acetyl chitobiose, tri-N-acetyl chitotriose or penta-N-acetyl chitopentaose.
TI  - Antibody levels to bacterial peptidoglycan in human sera during the time course of endocarditis and bacteremic infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Sera from patients with endocarditis and bacteremia due to Staphylococcus aureus  were compared for peptidoglycan-binding capacity with those from normal blood donors. Those patients treated with beta-lactam antibiotics had higher antigen-binding levels than normal donors and patients treated exclusively with vancomycin (P less than 0.01). The factor responsible for this activity was purified by affinity chromatography from a normal donor and shown to be an immunoglobulin. Specificity studies indicated that the immunodominant determinant was a peptide sequence found in peptidoglycan precursors. Since soluble peptidoglycan molecules having the precursor peptide sequence are known to be secreted by some gram-positive bacteria like Micrococcus luteus when grown in the presence of beta-lactam antibiotics, these soluble molecules may constitute the "natural" immunogen. Such a hypothesis is consistent with the study of the peptidoglycan-binding capacities in the sera of these patients during the course of treatment. For most of the responding patients studied (four of four with bacteremia and seven of nine with endocarditis), a significant increase in peptidoglycan-binding capacity was observed in sera taken 1 to 5 weeks after the initiation of beta-lactam antibiotic therapy (compared with the initial serum studied). No such increase in the peptidoglycan-binding capacity over a similar time span was noted in the sera of people not receiving beta-lactam antibiotics (none of seven).
TI  - [Characteristics of the effect of egg lysozyme on micrococci and staphylococci].
AB  - The nature of the optical density of suspensions of Staph. aureus and M. luteus cells at various concentrations of chicken egg albumin lysozyme and two products of its chemical transformation was studied comparatively. The experiments were performed in 1/15 M Na-phosphate buffer at pH 6.2 and a temperature of 20-22 degrees C. It was shown that the decrease in the optical density of the suspensions observed at relatively low concentrations of lysozyme, i.e. 0.032-0.064 mg/ml, was due to lysis of both microbial species. The increase in the optical density of the suspensions at higher (0.5-2.0 mg/ml) concentrations of lysozyme was connected with formation of insoluble aggregates of an electrostatic character. Lysozyme in such aggregates is the positively charged component and the microbial cell material is the negatively charged component. When M. luteus strains are sensitive to lysozyme, the aggregates are formed from the cell fragments or lysis acid products. When Staph, aureus strains have higher resistance levels, the aggregates are formed from both the lysis products and the intact live cells which is of special interest.
TI  - [Action of egg lysozyme on representatives of the family Micrococcaceae. The action on staphylococci].
AB  - The results of the study on the effect of various concentrations of lysozyme on staphylococci of three species, i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus are presented. The study was performed with the use of the turbidimetric method. It was found that all the staphylococci had a common tendency for changing the optic density (OD) of the suspensions under the effect of lysozyme which was different from that in Micrococcus luteus. However, the dynamics of decreasing the OD in Staph. saprophyticus was characterized by some properties which provided a supposition that the structures of the cell walls in Staph. aureus and Staph. epidermidis were close, while the cell walls in Staph. saprophyticus had some unknown characteristics.
TI  - Comparative immunological study of catalases in the genus Micrococcus.
AB  - Double immunodiffusion tests were performed with crude extracts from various Micrococcus species and antisera against catalase of Micrococcus luteus CCM 169. Cell-free extracts of M. lylae ATCC 27566 exhibited good cross-reaction. Cell-free extracts or catalase enriched preparations of M. varians reacted very weakly and no reaction has been found with preparation of M. kristinae, M. nishinomiyaensis, M. roseus and M. sedentarius. The quantitative microcomplement fixation assay also revealed a closer relationship between M. luteus and M. lylae than between M. luteus and M. varians. Strains of other Micrococcus species reacted in the microcomplement assay with M. luteus antiserum just a weakly as non-related strains, e.g. Staphylococcus aureus or Cellulomonas cartalyticum.
TI  - Classification of micrococci on the basis of deoxyribonucleic acid homology.
AB  - The DNA homology relationships of 25 micrococci (15 strains of Micrococcus, eight strains of Sarcina and two strains of Staphylococcus) were studied by the deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization method using nuclease S1, an endonuclease specific for single-stranded DNA molecules. Nineteen of the strains were classified into three groups. Group I contained Micrococcus lysodeikticus IAMI056, M. luteus IAMI1010, M. flavus IAMI2005 and IAMI2006, Sarcina flava IAMI2007 and IAMI1006. S. subflava IAMI2009, S. lutea ATCC381, and ATCC382, and M. luteus IAMI1006. Group II contained M. roseus IAMI315, ATCC412, ATCC185 and IAMI295. Group III contained S. lutea IAMI099, IFO3232 and ATCC383, M. varians ATCC399 and Staphylococcus lactis ATCC15306. Micrococcus luteus IAMI097, M. varians ATCC19099 and ATCC19100, M. conglomeratus IAMI459 and IAMI470, and St. aureus IAMI011 could not be assigned to any of the three groups. The grouping corresponds to that derived from the results of differential lysis by lysozyme, 'lytic enzyme 2' from Cytophaga sp., or Streptomyces albus G enzyme; and to types of peptidoglycan in the cell walls and genetic transformation. The usefulness of classification based on sensitivity to various lytic enzymes was demonstrated. Group I probably coincides with M. luteus of Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology (1974), and groups II and III with M. roseus and M. varians respectively.
TI  - [Bacterial flora of the conjunctival sac of the horse].
AB  - The AA. report the results of taxonomic research conducted on the conjunctival sac of 59 horses for identification of the present bacterial flora. In the controlled animals, it was observed, at the level of the considered niche, a community constituted of normal bacterial populations, but not autochtonous in the significance they attributed from DUBOS et al., relative to the characterization of the indigenous microbiota of the intestine. The isolated normal bacterial flora seems to be constituted of: Micrococcus (subgroup 6 of Baird-Parker, M. luteus, Micrococcus spp.) isolated in 49,15% of the samples; Staphylococcus aureus and St. epidermidis (18,64%); Moraxella osloensis, M. phenylpiruvica, M. equi and Moraxella spp. (11,86%); Bacillus cereus (11,86%); Neisseria catarrhalis (8,47%); Streptococcus equi and Str. zooepidemicus (6,77%); Corynebacterium spp. (6,77%) and Acinetobacter lwoffi (5,08%). The AA. have found, besides, a particular group of bacteria of uncertain classification, attributed to the coryneforms and found in 30,50% of the examined horses. So-called transient bacteria taxa have been considered are Streptomyces spp., isolated in the 10,16% of the controlled subjects, Aerococcus viridans and Bacillus spp. found in only one equine.
TI  - Distribution and persistence of Staphylococcus and Micrococcus species and other  aerobic bacteria on human skin.
AB  - The districution of Staphylococcus and Micrococcus species and associated coryneform bacteria, Acinetobacter, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Bacillus, and Streptomyces on skin was determined during October 1971 from samples collected on persons living in North Carolina and New Jersey. Persistence of these organisms on skin was estimated in temporal studies conducted during the period from June 1971 to June 1972 on persons living in North Carolina. Staphylococci and coryneforms were the most predominant and persistent bacteria isolated from the nares and axillae. Staphylococci, coryneforms, micrococci, and Bacillus were the most predominant and persistent bacteria isolated from the head, legs, and arms. Acinetobacters were most frequently isolated during the warmer months of the years. Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis were the most predominant and persistent staphylococci isolated from the nares, whereas S. epidermidis and S. hominis were the most predominant and persistent staphylocicci isolated from the axillae, head, legs, and arms. S. capitis was often isolated from the head and arms and S. haemolyticus was often isolated from the head, legs, and arms. S. simulans, S. xylosus, S. cohnii, S. saprophyticus, S. warneri, and an unclassified coagulase-positive species were only occasionally isolated from skin. Micrococcus luteus was the most predominant and persistent Micrococcus isolated from skin and preferred regions of the head, legs, and arms. M. varians was the second most frequent Micrococcus isolated. M. lylae, M. sedentarius, M. roseus, M. kristinae, and M. nishinomiyaensis were only occasionally isolated from skin. M. lylae was most frequently isolated during the colder months of the years.
TI  - Interaction of wheat-germ agglutinin with bacterial cells and cell-wall polymers.
AB  - Wheat germ agglutinin was found to agglutinate cells of Escherichia coli PAT 84,  Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus H, and of S. aureus 52A5, but not cells of S. aureus 52A2. Interaction of wheat germ agglutinin with a soluble linear peptidoglycan secreted by Micrococcus luteus and with the teichoic acid of S. aureus H was demonstrated by agar gel diffusion, quantitative precipitation and inhibition of hemagglutination of trypsinized rabbit erythrocytes. No interaction could be demonstrated with the teichoic acid from a phage-resistant mutant (S. aureus 52A2) which lacks A-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues. All interactions were specifically inhibited by low concentrations of chitotriose (GlcNAcbeta1 leads to 4GlcNAcbeta1 leads to 4GlcNAc) and the bacterial cell wall tetrasaccharide, GlcNAcbeta1 leads to 4MurNAcbeta1 leads to 4GlcNAcbeta1 leads to 4MurNAc. Hemagglutination-inhibition experiments showed that the linear peptidoglycan and the teichoic acid of S. aureus H were several thousand times more potent inhibitors of wheat germ agglutinin than was N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. Comparison of the efficiency of different saccharides in inhibition of hemagglutination and precipitation of polymers by wheat germ agglutinin, strongly suggests that secondary, non-specific interactions contribute to the binding of the lectin to the polymers.
