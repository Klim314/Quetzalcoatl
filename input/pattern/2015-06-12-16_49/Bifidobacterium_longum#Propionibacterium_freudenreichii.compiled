TI  - Construction of a reporter vector system for in vivo analysis of promoter activity in Propionibacterium freudenreichii.
AB  - A beta-galactosidase reporter system for the analysis of promoter elements in Propionibacterium freudenreichii was designed. The pTD210 in vivo reporter vector was constructed using a promoterless lacZ gene from Bifidobacterium longum cloned into the pAMT1 plasmid. The utility of the pTD210 reporter vector was demonstrated by an investigation of six predicted promoters in P. freudenreichii. The system produced accurate and reproducible measurements that facilitated both promoter identification and the quantification of promoter activities.
TI  - Safety assessment of dairy microorganisms: Propionibacterium and Bifidobacterium.
AB  - The genera Propionibacterium and Bifidobacterium are clustered in the class Actinobacteria and form the anaerobic branch of coryneform bacteria. The dairy propionibacteria comprising four species P. freudenreichii, P. acidipropionici, P. jensenii and P. thoenii are industrially important as starter cultures in hard-cheese ripening and recently also as protective bio-preservatives and probiotics. These four species are considered as safe whereas cutaneous Propionibacterium species (also named "acnes group") are pathogens. In contrast, bifidobacteria in fermented dairy products and milk powder are exclusively used as probiotics; selected strains of several species (out of more than thirty) contribute to this task. It has been only rarely found that commensal bifidobacteria have been connected with certain dental and other infections. Consequently, only one single species, Bifidobacterium dentium, is recognized as pathogenic. Genome sequence analysis of Bifidobacterium longum and molecular biological analysis of other probiotic strains confirmed so far the absence of virulence and pathogenecity factors. However, tetracycline resistance genes tet(W), although probably not easy transferable, were found in Bifidobacterium strains, also in Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, the worldwide most used industrial strain. Conclusively, strains from the Propionibacterium and Bifidobacterium species in dairy food generally represent so far no health hazards.
TI  - Production of extracellular bifidogenic growth stimulator by anaerobic and aerobic cultivations of several propionibacterial strains.
AB  - Production of a bifidogenic growth stimulator (BGS) by propionic acid bacteria was investigated under anaerobic and aerobic culture conditions. To measure the concentration of extracellular BGS produced by propionic acid bacteria, we evaluated the effects of bioassay conditions using Bifidobacterium longum as a test microorganism on the formation of a growth-stimulation zone. The diameter of the growth-stimulation zone was significantly affected by both the component concentrations and the pH of a bioassay medium. The optimum component concentrations and pH of a bioassay medium were one-half of the normal values and 8.5, respectively. Using the bioassay method, we can measure the concentration of BGS produced by propionic acid bacteria ranging in concentrations from 0.1 microg/l to 1 mg/l using 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (DHNA) and 2-amino-3-carboxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (ACNQ) as standards. Of six dairy propionic acid bacterial strains tested, the four strains (Propionibacterium freudenreichii ET-3, P. shermanii PZ-3, P. acidipropionici JCM 6432, and P. jensenii JCM 6433) produced BGS at a concentration range of 4-23 mg/l under the anaerobic culture conditions. Analysis of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) showed that more than 70% of total BGS produced in supernatant samples was DHNA and no ACNQ was produced by the strains. The effect of oxygen supply on BGS production was investigated for the four BGS-producing strains. The aerobic conditions exerted in positive effects on BGS production by only P. acidipropionici JCM 6432. The concentration of BGS obtained in the aerobic cultivation of P. acidipropionici JCM 6432 was 1.3-fold than that in anaerobic cultivation. Different properties (BGS production as well as cell growth and glucose metabolism) occurring in response to the aerobic conditions were observed, depending on the propionic acid bacterial strain used. This paper is the first report on BGS production by propionibacterial strains except for P. freudenreichii.
TI  - Production of Propionibacterium shermanii biomass and vitamin B12 on spent media.
AB  - AIMS: The propionibacteria are commercially important due to their use in the cheese industry, and there is a growing interest for their probiotic effects. Stimulatory effects of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) on propionic acid bacteria have been observed. This study was designed to examine the possibility of using spent media previously used to grow LAB for the production of biomass and metabolites of Propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii. METHODS AND RESULTS: Seventeen MRS and vegetable juice media were prefermented by various LAB and evaluated for their ability to subsequently support the growth of Propionibacterium, using automated spectrophotometry (AS). Growth of Propionibacterium in spent media was strongly affected by the LAB strain used to produce the spent medium. The native MRS medium (not prefermented) yielded the highest optical density values followed by prefermented media by Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium longum and Lactococcus lactis. Prefermented cabbage juice enabled good growth of Propionibacterium. For the production of organic acids and vitamin B12, cells of Propionibacterium were concentrated and immobilized in alginate beads in the aim of accelerating the bioconversions. More propionic acid was obtained in spent media than in native MRS. The concentration of vitamin B12 was higher in media fermented with free cells than those with immobilized cultures; with the free cells, its concentration varied from 900 to 1800 ng ml(-1) of media. CONCLUSIONS: It was demonstrated that spent media could be recycled for the production of Propionibacterium and metabolites, depending on the LAB strain that was previously grown. Media remediation is needed to improve the production of vitamin B12, especially with immobilized cells. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study presents an option for recycling of spent media generated by producers of LAB or producers of fermented vegetables. The propionic fermentation may result in three commercial products: biomass, vitamin B12 or organic acids, which may be used as starters, supplements or food preservatives. It is an attractive process from economical and environmental standpoints.
TI  - Production of a mixture of antimicrobial organic acids from lactose by co-culture of Bifidobacterium longum and Propionibacterium freudenreichii.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of standard solutions of three organic acids (lactic, acetic, and propionic acids) were compared using Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas sp. and Staphylococcus aureus as test microorganisms. At the same concentrations of the undissociated form, the antimicrobial activities of acetic and propionic acids were higher than that of lactic acid, irrespective of test microorganisms. In a single cultivation of Bifidobacterium longum, a mixture of lactic (17 g/l) and acetic (20 g/l) acids was produced from 50 g/l lactose and its antimicrobial activities against M. luteus, Pseudomonas sp., and S. aureus correspond to that of 32, 19, and 25 g/l of acetic acid, respectively. To increase the total antimicrobial activity, a co-culture of B. longum and Propionibacterium freudenreichii, in which lactic acid produced once from lactose by B. longum was converted to acetic and propionic acids by P. freudenreichii, was done using TPY medium containing commercially available peptones as a nitrogen source. By the sequential conversion of lactose using the two microorganisms, the culture supernatant containing a mixture of acetic (27 g/l) and propionic (13 g/l) acids without lactic acid was produced. The antimicrobial activities of the mixture against M. luteus, Pseudomonas sp., and S. aureus were 35, 30, and 26 g/l as a concentration of acetic acid, respectively, higher than that obtained in the cultivation of B. longum alone. When the medium containing an enzymatic hydrolyzate of whey proteins with a protease was used in the co-culture of B. longum and P. freudenreichii, the culture supernatant containing the mixture of organic acids was also obtained in the same manner as the co-culture using TPY medium and the activities were 43, 29, and 29 g/l as a concentration of acetic acid for M. luteus, Pseudomonas sp. and S. aureus, respectively.
