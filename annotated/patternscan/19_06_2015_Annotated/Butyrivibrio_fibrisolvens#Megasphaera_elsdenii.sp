TI  == effects of vanillin, quillaja saponin, and essential oils on in vitro fermentation and protein-degrading microorganisms of the rumen.
AB  == this study investigated the effects of vanillin on methanogenesis and rumen fermentation, and the responses of ruminal protein-degrading bacteria to vanillin (at concentrations of 0, 0.76 and 1.52 g/l), essential oils (clove oil, 1 g/l; origanum oil, 0.50 g/l, and peppermint oil, 1 g/l), and quillaja saponin (at concentration of 0 and 6 g/l) in vitro. methane production, degradabilities of feed substrate, and ammonia concentration decreased linearly with increasing doses of vanillin. concentration of total volatile fatty acids also decreased, whereas proportion of butyrate tended to increase linearly with increasing doses  of vanillin. protozoa population decreased, but abundances of ruminococcus flavefaciens, prevotella bryantii, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, prevotella ruminicola, clostridium aminophilum, and ruminobacter amylophilus increased with  increasing doses of vanillin. origanum and clove oils resulted in lower ammonia concentrations compared to control and peppermint oil. all the tested essential oils decreased abundances of protozoa, selenomonas ruminantium, r. amylophilus, p. ruminicola and p. bryantii, with the largest decrease resulted from origanum oil followed by clove oil and peppermint oil. the abundances of megasphaera elsdenii, c. aminophilum, and clostridium sticklandii were deceased by origanum oil while that of b. fibrisolvens was lowered by both origanum and clove oils. saponin decreased ammonia concentration and protozoal population, but increased the abundances of s. ruminantium, r. amylophilus, p. ruminicola, and p. bryantii, though the magnitude was small (less than one log unit). the results suggest that reduction of ammonia production by vanillin and saponin may not be caused by direct inhibition of major known proteolytic bacteria, and essential oils can have different inhibitory effects on different proteolytic bacteria, resulting in varying reduction in ammonia production.

TI  == evaluation of rumen fatty acid hydrogenation intermediates and differences in bacterial communities after feeding wheat- or corn-based dried distillers grains  to feedlot cattle.
AB  == the effect of partially replacing rolled barley (86.6% of control diet) with 20%  wheat dried distillers grains plus solubles (ddgs), 40% wheat ddgs, 20% corn ddgs, or 40% corn ddgs (dietary dm basis) on rumen fluid fatty acid (fa) composition and some rumen bacterial communities was evaluated using 100 steers (20 per treatment). wheat ddgs increased the 11t- to 10t-18:1 ratio (p < 0.05) in rumen fluid and there was evidence that the conversion of trans-18:1 to 18:0 was  reduced in the control and wheat ddgs diets but not in the corn ddgs diet. bacterial community profiles obtained using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and evaluated by pearson correlation similarity matrices were not consistent for diet and, therefore, these could not be linked to different specific rumen fa. this inconsistency may be related to the nature of diets fed (dominant effect of barley), limited change in dietary composition as the result  of ddgs inclusion, large animal-to-animal variation, and possibly additional stress as a result of transport just before slaughter. ruminal densities of a key fiber-digesting bacteria specie that produces 11t-18:1 from linoleic and linolenic acids (butyrivibrio fibrisolvens), and a lactate producer originally thought responsible for production of 10t,12c-18:2 (megasphaera elsdenii) were not influenced by diet (p > 0.05).

TI  == effect of ruminal pulse dose of polyunsaturated fatty acids on ruminal microbial  populations and duodenal flow and milk profiles of fatty acids.
AB  == the objective of this study was to examine the effect of ruminal pulse dose of free linoleic acid (la) and free docosahexaenoic acid (dha) on microbial populations in the rumen, duodenal fatty acid (fa) flow, milk composition, and milk fa profiles of chinese holstein dairy cows. four rumen- and duodenal-fistulated chinese holstein cows in mid lactation (138.5 +/- 10d in milk) were randomly assigned to 3 treatment groups and 1 control group in a 4 x 4 latin square design over 4 periods (3 wk per period). diets contained either no la or 2.7% la and either no dha or 0.5% dha in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. ruminal pulse dose with dha increased counts of megasphaera elsdenii, decreased fibrobacter succinogenes, but did not affect butyrivibrio fibrisolvens  or ruminococcus flavefaciens. the pulse dose of la at 2.7% dry matter had no effect on the population sizes of the 3 major cellulolytic bacterial species or m. elsdenii, and no interaction was observed between la and dha. the pulse dose of la or dha, either alone or in combination, increased the duodenal flow of vaccenic acid (va). the milk va and cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (cla) contents also increased in response to the fatty acid pulse dose, and the pulse dose of both la and dha together had the most profound stimulatory effect. this study indicated that ruminal pulse dose of la or dha could be used to increase duodenal flow of va and the milk contents of potentially health-promoting fa, such as va and cis-9,trans-11 cla. these results might be useful in formulating dietary interventions to improve milk cis-9,trans-11 cla contents.

TI  == rumen microbial population dynamics during adaptation to a high-grain diet.
AB  == high-grain adaptation programs are widely used with feedlot cattle to balance enhanced growth performance against the risk of acidosis. this adaptation to a high-grain diet from a high-forage diet is known to change the rumen microbial population structure and help establish a stable microbial population within the  rumen. therefore, to evaluate bacterial population dynamics during adaptation to  a high-grain diet, 4 ruminally cannulated beef steers were adapted to a high-grain diet using a step-up diet regimen containing grain and hay at ratios of 20:80, 40:60, 60:40, and 80:20. the rumen bacterial populations were evaluated at each stage of the step-up diet after 1 week of adaptation, before the steers were transitioned to the next stage of the diet, using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) analysis, 16s rrna gene libraries, and quantitative real-time pcr. the t-rflp analysis displayed a shift in the rumen microbial population structure during the final two stages of the step-up diet. the 16s rrna gene libraries demonstrated two distinct rumen microbial populations in hay-fed and high-grain-fed animals and detected only 24 common operational taxonomic units out of 398 and 315, respectively. the 16s rrna gene libraries of  hay-fed animals contained a significantly higher number of bacteria belonging to  the phylum fibrobacteres, whereas the 16s rrna gene libraries of grain-fed animals contained a significantly higher number of bacteria belonging to the phylum bacteroidetes. real-time pcr analysis detected significant fold increases  in the megasphaera elsdenii, streptococcus bovis, selenomonas ruminantium, and prevotella bryantii populations during adaptation to the high-concentrate (high-grain) diet, whereas the butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and fibrobacter succinogenes populations gradually decreased as the animals were adapted to the high-concentrate diet. this study evaluates the rumen microbial population using  several molecular approaches and presents a broader picture of the rumen microbial population structure during adaptation to a high-grain diet from a forage diet.

TI  == biotransformation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene by pure culture ruminal bacteria.
AB  == twenty-one ruminal bacteria species were tested for their ability to degrade 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (tnt) within 24 h. butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, fibrobacter succinogenes, lactobacillus vitulinus, selenomonas ruminantium, streptococcus caprinus, and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were able to completely degrade 100 mg/l tnt, with <5% of the original tnt recovered as diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. eubacterium ruminantium, lactobacillus ruminis, ruminobacter amylophilus, streptococcus bovis, and wolinella succinogenes were able to completely degrade 100 mg/l tnt, with 23-60% of the tnt recovered as aminodinitrotoluene and/or diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. clostridium polysaccharolyticum, megasphaera elsdenii, prevotella bryantii, prevotella ruminicola, ruminococcus albus, and ruminococcus flavefaciens were able to degrade 80-90% of 100 mg/l tnt. desulfovibrio desulfuricans subsp. desulfuricans, prevotella albensis, and treponema bryantii degraded 50-80% of the tnt. anaerovibrio lipolytica was completely inhibited by 100 mg/l tnt. these results indicate that a variety of rumen bacteria is capable of transforming tnt.

TI  == effect of monensin feeding and withdrawal on populations of individual bacterial  species in the rumen of lactating dairy cows fed high-starch rations.
AB  == real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was used to quantify 16 procaryotic taxa in the rumina of two lactating dairy cows following supply and subsequent withdrawal of the feed additive monensin (13.9 mg/kg of diet dry matter) in a high-starch, silage-based ration. pcr was conducted on dna from rumen samples collected 6 h post feeding on two successive days before monensin supplementation, after 30 days of monensin supplementation, and at six weekly intervals after monensin withdrawal. mean values of relative population size (rps, the percent of bacterial 16s rrna copy number) for genus prevotella increased (p < 0.05) from 41.8% without monensin to 49.2% with monensin and declined to 42.5% after monensin withdrawal. mean rps values for two biohydrogenating species (megasphaera elsdenii and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens) were low (<0.4%) and declined several-fold in response to monensin. mean rps values for the biohydrogenating species eubacterium ruminantium, four cellulolytic species, four starch- or dextrin-fermenting species, and domain archaea were not altered (p > 0.10) upon monensin feeding or withdrawal. the data suggest that monensin in high-starch diets does not suppress populations of classical ruminal gram-positive bacteria or the availability of h2, though it may affect bacteria involved in biohydrogenation of lipids that regulate bovine mammary lipogenesis.

TI  == dominance of prevotella and low abundance of classical ruminal bacterial species  in the bovine rumen revealed by relative quantification real-time pcr.
AB  == relative quantification real-time pcr was used to quantify several bacterial species in ruminal samples from two lactating cows, each sampled 3 h after feeding on two successive days. abundance of each target taxon was calculated as  a fraction of the total 16s rrna gene copies in the samples, using taxon-specific and eubacterial domain-level primers. bacterial populations showed a clear predominance of members of the genus prevotella, which comprised 42% to 60% of the bacterial rrna gene copies in the samples. however, only 2% to 4% of the bacterial rrna gene copies were represented by the classical ruminal prevotella species prevotella bryantii, prevotella ruminicola and prevotella brevis. the proportion of rrna gene copies attributable to fibrobacter succinogenes, ruminococcus flavefaciens, selenomonas ruminantium and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were each generally in the 0.5% to 1% range. proportions for ruminobacter amylophilus and eubacterium ruminantium were lower (0.1% to 0.2%), while butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, streptococcus bovis, ruminococcus albus and megasphaera elsdenii were even less abundant, each comprising <0.03% of the bacterial rrna gene copies. the data suggest that the aggregate abundance of the  most intensively studied ruminal bacterial species is relatively low and that a large fraction of the uncultured population represents a single bacterial genus.

TI  == [metabolism of rumen microbial populations formed on biosubstrates with different assimilation under the effect of pentachlorophenol].
AB  == it has been established that metabolism of mixed microbial population formed on easy assimilated sources of energy and nitrogen (concentrate diet) progressed on  higher level. there is increase of amilolytic activity, formation of lactate, ammonia, low molecular carbonic acids with predomination of propionate molar fraction. the increased resistance to effect of pentachlorophenol (pcp) is characteristic nature of the latter. the role of the most resistant synthrophic bacteria to pcp increases. the pure strains of streptococcus bovis and megasphaera elsdenii do not stop metabolism at 100 microm of pcp. mixed population of microorganisms formed on hard accessible biosubstrates (cellulose)  and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens have the increased cellulosolytic activity and while the high sensibility even to low doses of pcp (10-40 microm) is observed. it has been supposed that mechanism of pcp effect is ambiguous for various species of microbial complex of rumen. it's effect strength on all main chains of metabolism (membrane transport, energetic exchange, protein biosynthesis, etc.) significantly depends on capacity of pool of metabolic intermediates formed as a  result of definite program of biotechnology of nurture, but significantly decreases the harmful effect of biocides.

TI  == establishing populations of megasphaera elsdenii ye 34 and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens ye 44 in the rumen of cattle fed high grain diets.
AB  == aim: to determine whether megasphaera elsdenii ye34 (lactic acid degrader) and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens ye44 (alternative starch utilizer to streptococcus bovis) establish viable populations in the rumen of beef cattle rapidly changed from a forage-based to a grain-based diet. methods and results: five steers were  inoculated with the two bacterial strains (ye34 and ye44) and five served as uninoculated controls. with the exception of one animal in the control group, which developed acidosis, all steers rapidly adapted to the grain-based diet without signs of acidosis (ph decline and accumulation of lactic acid). bacterial populations of s. bovis, b. fibrisolvens and m. elsdenii were enumerated using real-time taq nuclease assays. populations of s. bovis remained constant (except  in the acidotic animal) at ca 10(7) cell equivalents (ce) ml-1 throughout the study. megasphaera elsdenii ye34, was not detectable in animals without grain in  the diet, but immediately established in inoculated animals, at 10(6) ce ml-1, and increased 100-fold in the first 4 days following inoculation. butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, initially present at 10(8) ce ml-1, declined rapidly with the introduction of grain into the diet and was not detectable 8 days after grain introduction. conclusion: megasphaera elsdenii rapidly establishes a lactic acid-utilizing bacterial population in the rumen of grain-fed cattle 7-10 days earlier than in uninoculated cattle. significance and impact of the study: the study has demonstrated that rumen bacterial populations, and in particular the establishment of bacteria inoculated into the rumen for probiotic use, can be monitored by real-time pcr.

TI  == the ability of "low g + c gram-positive" ruminal bacteria to resist monensin and  counteract potassium depletion.
AB  == gram-negative ruminal bacteria with an outer membrane are generally more resistant to the feed additive, monensin, than gram-positive species, but some bacteria can adapt and increase their resistance. 16s rrna sequencing indicates that a variety of ruminal bacteria are found in the "low g + c gram-positive group," but some of these bacteria are monensin resistant and were previously described as gram-negative species (e.g., selenomonas ruminantium and megasphaera elsdenii). the activity of monensin can be assayed by its ability to cause potassium loss, and results indicated that the amount of monensin needed to catalyze half maximal potassium depletion (k(d)) from low g + c gram-positive ruminal bacteria varied by as much as 130-fold. the k(d) values for butyrivibrio  fibrisolvens 49, streptococcus bovis jb1, clostridium aminophilum f, s. ruminantium hd4, and m. elsdenii b159 were 10, 65, 100, 1020, and 1330 nm monensin, respectively. b. fibrisolvens was very sensitive to monensin, and it did not adapt. s. bovis and c. aminophilum cultures that were transferred repeatedly with sub-lethal doses of monensin had higher k(d) values than unadapted cultures, but the k(d) was always less than 800 nm. s. ruminantium and  m. elsdenii cells were highly resistant (k(d) > 1000 nm), and this resistance could be explained by the ability of these low g + c gram-positive bacteria to synthesize outer membranes.

TI  == cyclic amp in ruminal and other anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == an examination of camp levels in predominant species of ruminal bacteria and other anaerobic bacteria was conducted. cellular camp concentrations of glucose-grown cultures of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 49, prevotella ruminicola d31d, selenomonas ruminantium hd4 and d, megasphaera elsdenii b159, streptococcus bovis jb1, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron 5482, and clostridium acetobutylicum atcc 824 were determined at various times during growth by a competitive binding radioimmunoassay procedure. the results were compared to those for escherichia coli nrrl b3704. the levels of camp ranged from undetectable for b. thetaiotaomicron to approximately 15 pmol/mg cell protein for p. ruminicola d31d. varying the growth substrate in a manner previously shown to elicit regulatory response did not alter the level of camp in these organisms. in general, camp concentrations present in these organisms were much lower than the 6-25 pmol/mg cell protein observed for e. coli. the levels of camp in p. ruminicola were consistently higher than levels in other anaerobes, particularly during the early exponential and stationary phases of growth. based on these data it seems unlikely that camp is involved in regulation of substrate catabolism in the anaerobic bacteria examined except in p. ruminicola where it may have an unknown  regulatory function.

TI  == a survey of peptidase activity in rumen bacteria.
AB  == twenty-nine strains of 14 species of rumen bacteria were screened for their ability to hydrolyse ala2, ala5, glyarg-4-methoxy-2-naphthylamide (glyarg-mna) and leu-mna. several species, notably megasphaera elsdenii, were active against ala2, and a smaller number, including bacteroides ruminicola, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, ruminococcus flavefaciens, lachnospira multipara and ruminobacter amylophilus, broke down ala5. streptococcus bovis had an exceptionally high leucine arylamidase activity. however, only ba. ruminicola hydrolysed glyarg-mna. further investigation revealed that only ba. ruminicola and bu. fibrisolvens hydrolysed ala5 to ala3 and ala2, with little ala4 being produced, in a manner similar to rumen fluid. the activity of ba. ruminicola against synthetic peptidase substrates, including glyarg-mna, lysala-mna, argarg-mna, glypro-mna, leuval-mna, and ala3-p-nitroanilide, was similar to that of rumen fluid, whereas  the activity of bu. fibrisolvens was quite different. since the main mechanism by which peptides are broken down in the rumen is similar to dipeptidyl aminopeptidase type i, for which glyarg-mna is a diagnostic substrate, it was concluded that ba. ruminicola was the most important single species in peptide breakdown in the rumen.

TI  == factors affecting the rate of breakdown of bacterial protein in rumen fluid.
AB  == 1. the cellular proteins of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, lactobacillus casei, megasphaera elsdenii, selenomonas ruminantium and streptococcus bovis were labelled by growth in the presence of l-[14c]leucine, and the breakdown of labelled protein was measured in incubations of these bacteria with rumen fluid to which unlabelled 5 mm-l-leucine was added. the rate of protein breakdown was estimated from the rate of release of radioactivity into acid-soluble material. 2. protein breakdown occurred at different rates in different species. the mean rates for b. fibrisolvens, l. casei, m. elsdenii, sel. ruminantium and str. bovis were 28.6, 18.1, 17.7, 10.5 and 5.3%/h respectively in samples of strained rumen  fluid (srf) with different protozoal populations. rates of 3%/h or less were found in srf from ciliate-free sheep or in faunated srf from which protozoa had been removed by centrifugation. further removal of mixed rumen bacteria had little effect. suspensions of washed protozoa degraded bacterial protein at rates which were of the same order as those found in srf. 3. the rate of breakdown of bacterial protein in different samples of srf tended to increase as the numbers of small entodiniomorphid protozoa increased. the numbers of larger entodiniomorphs and holotrichs had no obvious influence on this rate. 4. autoclaved and u.v.-treated bacteria were generally no different from live bacteria in their susceptibility to breakdown in srf from faunated sheep, indicating that endogenous protein turnover was not a significant cause of bacterial protein catabolism. 5. the rate of bacterial protein breakdown was unrelated to the proteolytic activity of srf. 6. it was concluded that predation  by small protozoa is by far the most important cause of bacterial protein turnover in the rumen, with autolysis, other lytic factors and endogenous proteolysis being of minor importance.

TI  == phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation of hexoses by ruminal bacteria: evidence for the phosphotransferase transport system.
AB  == six species of ruminal bacteria were surveyed for the phosphoenolpyruvate (pep)-dependent phosphorylation of glucose. selenomonas ruminantium hd4, streptococcus bovis jb1, and megasphaera elsdenii b159 all showed significant activity, but butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 49, bacteroides succinogenes s85, and bacteroides ruminicola b1(4) showed low rates of pep-dependent phosphorylation and much higher rates in the presence of atp. s. ruminantium hd4, s. bovis jb1, and m. elsdenii b159 also used pep to phosphorylate the nonmetabolizable glucose  analog 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-dg). rates of 2-dg phosphorylation with atp were negligible for s. bovis jb1 and m. elsdenii b159, but toluene-treated cells of s. ruminantium hd4 phosphorylated 2-dg in the presence of atp as well as pep. cell-free extracts of s. ruminantium hd4 used atp but not pep to phosphorylate glucose and 2-dg. since pep could serve as a phosphoryl donor in toluene-treated  cells but not in cell-free extracts, there was evidence for membrane and hence phosphotransferase system involvement in the pep-dependent activity. the atp-dependent phosphorylating enzymes from s. ruminantium hd4 and s. bovis jb1 had molecular weights of approximately 48,000 and were not inhibited by glucose 6-phosphate. based on these criteria, they were glucokinases rather than hexokinases. the s. ruminantium hd4 glucokinase was competitively inhibited by 2-dg and mannose, sugars that differ from glucose in the c-2 position. since 2-dg was a competitive inhibitor of glucose, the same enzyme probably phosphorylates both sugars. the s. bovis jb1 glucokinase was not inhibited by either 2-dg or mannose and had a higher km and vmax for glucose.

TI  == enrichment and isolation of rumen bacteria that reduce trans- aconitic acid to tricarballylic acid.
AB  == bacteria from the bovine rumen capable of reducing trans-aconitate to tricarballylate were enriched in an anaerobic chemostat containing rumen fluid medium and aconitate. after 9 days at a dilution rate of 0.07 h, the medium was diluted and plated in an anaerobic glove box. three types of isolates were obtained from the plates (a crescent-shaped organism, a pleomorphic rod, and a spiral-shaped organism), and all three produced tricarballylate in batch cultures that contained glucose and trans-aconitate. in glucose-limited chemostats (0.10 h), trans-aconitate reduction was associated with a decrease in the amount of reduced products formed from glucose. the crescent-shaped organism produced less  propionate, the pleomorphic rod produced less ethanol, and the spiral made less succinate and possibly h(2). aconitate reduction by the pleomorphic rod and the spiral organism was associated with a significant increase in cellular dry matter. experiments with stock cultures of predominant rumen bacteria indicated that selenomonas ruminantium, a species taxonomically similar to the crescent-shaped isolate, was an active reducer of trans-aconitate. strains of bacteroides ruminicola, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and megasphaera elsdenii produced little if any tricarballylate. wolinella succinogenes produced some tricarballylate. based on its stability constant for magnesium (k(eq) = 115), tricarballylate could be a factor in the hypomagnesemia that leads to grass tetany.

TI  == effects of chetomin on growth and acidic fermentation products of rumen bacteria.
AB  == chetomin, an antibiotic metabolite of chaetomium spp., was tested in the form of  its tetrathiol derivative for its effects on growth and carbohydrate metabolism by five strains of functionally important rumen bacteria. the compound was bacteriostatic for the strains tested and gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive to inhibition than gram-negative bacteria. in an anaerobic broth dilution assay using a medium lacking rumen fluid, the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of chetomin which completely inhibited growth of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens d1 for 18 h at 39 degrees c was 40 micrograms x ml-1. the mics determined under the same conditions for megasphaera elsdenii b159, selenomonas ruminantium ga192, and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens 24 were 160, 600, and 60 micrograms x ml-1, respectively. the mic for cellulose hydrolysis by ruminococcus albus 7 was 20 micrograms x ml-1. chetomin at concentrations below the mic appeared to inhibit the separation and division of cells in cultures of b. fibrisolvens d1. chetomin consistently stimulated acetate production from glucose by b. fibrisolvens d1, m. elsdenii b159, and s. ruminantium ga192 at the expense  of compounds which comprised major soluble end products of fermentation in cultures lacking chetomin.

TI  == effect of ph on growth rates of rumen amylolytic and lactilytic bacteria.
AB  == the relationship between the ph of the medium and specific growth rates, in well-buffered media at 38.5 degrees c, was determined for three strains of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and for one strain each of streptococcus bovis, selenomonas ruminantium subsp. lactilytica. megasphaera elsdenii, veillonella alcalescens, and propionibacterium acnes. the ph optima for growth were between 6.1 and 6.6 for all six species, and the upper ph limits were between 7.3 and 7.8. the lower limit ph values for growth on glucose were 5.4 for b. fibrisolvens, near 5.0 for v. alcalescens, and between 4.4 and 4.8 for the other  four species. these values fall within the minimum ph ranges found when these species are grown in poorly buffered medium with nonlimiting glucose concentrations. acid sensitivity per se could cause the washout of b. fibrisolvens, but not of the other five species, from the rumens of animals on high-starch diets.

TI  == effects of combinations of substrates on maximum growth rates of several rumen bacteria.
AB  == five rumen bacteria, selenomonas ruminantium, bacteroides ruminicola, megasphaera elsdenii, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and streptococcus bovis were grown in media  containing nonlimiting concentrations of glucose, sucrose, maltose, cellobiose, xylose and/or lactate. each bacterium was grown with every substrate that it could ferment in every possible two-way combination. only once did a combination  of substrates result in a higher maximum growth rate than that observed with either substrate alone. such stimulations of growth rate would be expected if specific factors unique to individual substrates (transport proteins and/or enzymes) were limiting. since such synergisms were rare, it was concluded that more general factors limit maximum growth rates in these five bacteria.

TI  == comparison of maintenance energy expenditures and growth yields among several rumen bacteria grown on continuous culture.
AB  == maintenance energy expenditures were mesured for five rumen bacteria, selenomonas ruminantium, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, bacteroides ruminicola, megasphaera elsdenii, and streptococcus bovis, by using a complex medium with glucose as the  carbon source. large differences (as high as 8.5-fold) in maintenance energy expenditures were seen among these bacteria. the suggestion is made that maintenance requirements could be a significant determinant of bacterial competition in the rumen. theoretical maximum growth yields, calculated from double reciprocal plots of yield versus dilution rate, were compared to theoretical y(atp) values in order to estimate minimum molar adenosine 5'-triphosphate yields from glucose for each bacterium. results showed that relative yield among the bacteria was growth rate dependent. at high dilution rates, both s. ruminantium and s. bovis produced lactate as their principal fermentation product. at lower dilution rates very little lactate was formed and  growth yields increased. acetate and ethanol were the predominant fermentation products of s. bovis at low dilution rates. other workers have shown that s. ruminantium produces acetate and propionate at low growth rates.

TI  == comparison of substrate affinities among several rumen bacteria: a possible determinant of rumen bacterial competition.
AB  == five rumen bacteria, selenomonas ruminantium, bacteroides ruminicola, megasphaera elsdenii, streptococcus bovis, and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens were grown in continuous culture. estimates of substrate affinities were derived from lineweaver-burk plots of dilution rate versus substrate concentration. each bacterium was grown on at least four of the six substrates: glucose, maltose, sucrose, cellobiose, xylose, and lactate. wide variations in substrate affinities were seen among the substrates utilized by a species and among species for the same substrate. these wide differences indicate that substrate affinity may be a  significant determinant of bacterial competition in the rumen where soluble substrate concentrations are often low. growth of these bacteria in continuous culture did not always follow typical michaelis-menten kinetics. inflated theoretical maximum growth rates and non-linear lineweaver-burk plots were sometimes seen. maintenance energy expenditures and limitation of growth rate by  factors other than substrate concentration (i.e., protein synthesis) are discussed as possible determinants of these deviations.

TI  == production of branched-chain volatile fatty acids by certain anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == net production of isobutyric acid, isovaleric acid, and 2-methylbutyric acid by cultures of bacteroides ruminicola and megasphaera elsdenii on media that contained trypticase or casein hydrolysate continued (up to 5 days) after growth  had ceased. only trace quantities of these acids were produced in a medium that contained a mixture of amino acids that did not include the branched-chain amino  acids. m. elsdenii produced increased quantities of the branched-chain fatty acids in a medium that contained trypticase when glucose was reduced or eliminated from the culture medium. however, b. ruminicola produced increased quantities of branched-chain fatty acids and of phenylacetic acid from trypticase when glucose was supplied at 3 mg/ml rather than at 1 mg/ml. single strains of streptococcus bovis, selenomonas ruminantium, bacteroides amylophilus, and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens did not produce branched-chain fatty acids.

TI  == studies on some characteristics of hydrogen production by cell-free extracts of rumen anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == hydrogen production was studied in the following rumen anaerobes: bacteroides clostridiiformis, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, enbacterium limosum, fusobacterium necrophorum, megasphaera elsdenii, ruminococcus albus, and ruminococcus flavefaciens. clostridium pasteurianum and escherichia coli were included for comparative purposes. hydrogen production from dithionite, dithionite-reduced methyl viologen, pyruvate, and formate was determined. all species tested produced hydrogen from dithionite-reduce methyl viologen, but only c. pasteurianum, b. clostridiiformis, e. limosum, and m. elsdenii produced hydrogen  from dithionite. all species except e. coli produced hydrogen from pyruvate, but  activity was low or absent in extracts of e. limosum, f. necrophorum, r. albus, and r. flavefaciens unless methyl viologen was added. hydrogen was produced from  formate only by e. coli, b. clostridiiformis, e. limosum, f. necrophorum, and r.  flavefaciens. extracts were subjected to ultracentrifugation in an effort to determine the solubility of hydrogenase. the hydrogenase of all species except e. coli appeared to be soluble, although variable amounts of hydrogenase activity were detected in the pellet. treatment of extracts of the rumen microbial species with deae-cellulose resulted in loss ofhydrogen production from pyruvate. activity was restored by the addition of methyl viologen. it is concluded that hydrogen production in these rumen microorganisms is similar to that in the saccharolytic clostridia.
