TI  - Reduction of odorants in swine manure by carbohydrate and bacterial amendments.
AB  - Malodors from pig manure storage pits are a problem lacking a cost-efficient solution particularly for small pig (Sus domestica) farms. The objective of this study was to reduce emissions of noxious odorants by changing the conditions in the pig manure to favor an altered microbial community. Sugars (maltose, lactose, and saccharose), carbohydrate-rich waste (maltose syrup and wheat flour), and bacterial amendments (Lactobacillus plantarum and L. amylophilus) were tested for their effect on manure pH, bacterial community, and gaseous emissions. In laboratory experiments, a permanent pH reduction was achieved with all carbohydrates when added to a 5% final concentration. Maltose significantly decreased emissions of sulfur-containing compounds, whereas bacterial amendments had little effect on odorants. Lactobacilli were found in manure receiving carbohydrate amendments alone, but Clostridiales, Bacteroidetes, and Enterobacteriaceae were observed in all treatments (including the control). At the mesocosm (60 L) level, maltose syrup and wheat flour amendments caused clear pH reductions in manure, whereas L. plantarum and L. amylophilus had no additional effect. The addition of maltose syrup and wheat flour to a manure storage pit (600 m(3)) lowered the pH slightly. When the manure was spread onto the fields, the observed reduction in odor was found to be reversible, and the release of malodors was delayed rather than eliminated. We conclude that these methods require further development to produce a reliable technical application.
