TI  == diversity and antibiograms of bacterial organisms isolated from samples of household drinking-water consumed by hiv-positive individuals in rural settings,  south africa.
AB  == diarrhoea is a hallmark of hiv infections in developing countries, and many diarrhoea-causing agents are often transmitted through water. the objective of the study was to determine the diversity and antibiotic susceptibility profiles of bacterial organisms isolated from samples of household drinking-water consumed by hiv-infected and aids patients. in the present study, household water stored for use by hiv-positive patients was tested for microbial quality, and isolated bacterial organisms were analyzed for their susceptibility profiles against 25 different antibiotics. the microbial quality of water was generally poor, and about 58% of water samples (n=270) were contaminated with faecal coliforms, with  counts varying from 2 colony-forming unit (cfu)/100 ml to 2.4x10(4) cfu/100 ml. values of total coliform counts ranged from 17 cfu/100 ml to 7.9x10(5)/100 ml. in total, 37 different bacterial species were isolated, and the major isolates included acinetobacter lwoffii (7.5%), enterobacter cloacae (7.5%), shigella spp. (14.2%), yersinia enterocolitica (6.7%), and pseudomonas spp. (16.3%). no vibrio  cholerae could be isolated; however, v. fluvialis was isolated from three water samples. the isolated organisms were highly resistant to cefazolin (83.5%), cefoxitin (69.2%), ampicillin (66.4%), and cefuroxime (66.2%). intermediate resistance was observed against gentamicin (10.6%), cefepime (13.4%), ceftriaxone (27.6%), and cefotaxime (29.9%). levofloxacin (0.7%), ceftazidime (2.2%), meropenem (3%), and ciprofloxacin (3.7%) were the most active antibiotics against all the microorganisms, with all recording less than 5% resistance. multiple drug resistance was very common, and 78% of the organisms were resistant to three or more antibiotics. education on treatment of household water is advised for hiv-positive patients, and measures should be taken to improve point-of-use water treatment as immunosuppressed individuals would be more susceptible to opportunistic infections.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. changes in czop susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, serratia liquefaciens, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter iwoffii,  burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, bacteroides fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas. czop preserved its antibacterial activity against m. (b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the  mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and  0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity  of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of  czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

TI  == a comparison of the bacteria found on the hands of 'homemakers' and neonatal intensive care unit nurses.
AB  == this prevalence study was conducted to compare the counts, types and antimicrobial resistance profiles of bacterial flora on the hands of individuals  in the community to that of nurses at a nearby university teaching hospital, with an intense hand hygiene regimen. hand cultures were obtained from 204 individuals during a home visit and 119 nurses in two neonatal intensive care units (nicus).  the mean total log counts of organisms were 5.73 and 5.24 for the homemakers [defined as the person (usually the mother) who is the primary person responsible for arranging childcare, cooking, cleaning etc] and nurse hands, respectively (p<0.0001). significantly more homemakers had acinetobacter lwoffii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, p. fluorescens/putida, and staphylococcus aureus on their hands compared with the nurses (all p<0.05). however, significantly more nurses had enterococcus faecalis, s. epidermidis, and s. warneri on their hands (p<0.05). of note, the hands of nurses harboured significantly more s. epidermidis strains resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, clindamycin, erythromycin, and oxacillin and s. warneri resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, clindamycin, and oxacillin (p<0.05). surprisingly, significantly more trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole-resistant s. epidermidis and ciprofloxacin-resistant s. warneri was recovered from the hands of homemakers (p<0.05). this study demonstrates differences in prevalence, bacterial composition and antimicrobial resistance of hand flora of hospital personnel compared with homemakers. moreover, the hands of homemakers may serve as community reservoirs for antimicrobial resistant strains of clinical importance.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a north american surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == cefdinir (fk482), an orally administered cephalosporin in vitro activity comparison against recent clinical isolates from five medical centers and determination of mic quality control guidelines.
AB  == cefdinir, a new oral cephalosporin, was compared to cefaclor, cefadroxil, cefixime, and cefuroxime against greater than 5000 recent aerobic clinical isolates. this multicenter study revealed broad-spectrum cefdinir activity against all enterobacteriaceae (mic50s, 0.06-2 micrograms/ml) except enterobacter cloacae, morganella morganii, proteus vulgaris, and serratia marcescens (mic50s,  greater than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml). oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic90s, 0.5-2 micrograms/ml), beta-hemolytic streptococcus group b (mic90, 0.06  micrograms/ml), and acinetobacter lwoffii were also susceptible to cefdinir. the  activity of cefdinir was similar to that of cefixime and cefuroxime against gram-negative organisms and superior to all tested oral cephems when tested against gram-positive cocci. none of the cephalosporins were active against oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus spp., enterococci, pseudomonas spp., or xanthomonas maltophilia. mic quality control range guidelines were established for the strains recommended by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards documents.
