d-fagomine lowers postprandial blood glucose and modulates bacterial adhesion.
d-fagomine is an iminosugar originally isolated from seeds of buckwheat (fagopyrum sculentum moench), present in the human diet and now available as a pure crystalline product. we tested d-fagomine for activities connected to a reduction in the risk of developing insulin resistance, becoming overweight and suffering from an excess of potentially pathogenic bacteria. the activities were: intestinal sucrase inhibition in vitro (rat mucosa and everted intestine sleeves), modulation of postprandial blood glucose in rats, bacterial agglutination and bacterial adhesion to pig intestinal mucosa. when ingested together with sucrose or starch, d-fagomine lowered blood glucose in a dose-dependent manner without stimulating insulin secretion. d-fagomine reduced the area under the curve (0-120 min) by 20 % (p < 0.01) and shifted the time to maximum blood glucose concentration (tmax) by 15 min at doses of 1-2 mg/kg body weight when administered together with 1 g sucrose/kg body weight. moreover, d-fagomine (0.14 mm) agglutinated 60 % of enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium) populations (p < 0.01), while it did not show this effect on bifidobacterium spp. or lactobacillus spp. at the same concentration, d-fagomine significantly (p < 0.001) inhibited the adhesion of enterobacteriaceae (95-99 % cells in the supernatant) and promoted the adhesion of lactobacillus acidophilus (56 % cells in the supernatant) to intestinal mucosa. d-fagomine did not show any effect on bacterial cell viability. based on all this evidence, d-fagomine may be used as a dietary ingredient or functional food component to reduce the health risks associated with an excessive intake of fast-digestible carbohydrates, or an excess of potentially pathogenic bacteria.
kinetic analysis of the antibacterial activity of probiotic lactobacilli towards  salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium reveals a role for lactic acid and other inhibitory compounds.
six lactobacillus strains including commercial probiotic ones (l. acidophilus ibb 801, l. amylovorus dce 471, l. casei shirota, l. johnsonii la1, l. plantarum aca-dc 287 and l. rhamnosus gg) were investigated, through batch fermentations under controlled conditions, for their capacity to inhibit salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium sl1344. all lactobacilli displayed strong antibacterial activity toward this gram-negative pathogen and significantly inhibited invasion of the pathogen into cultured human enterocyte-like caco-2/tc7 cells. by studying the production kinetics of antibacterial activity and applying the appropriate acid and ph control samples during a killing assay, we were able to distinguish between the effect of lactic acid and other inhibitory compounds produced. the antibacterial activity of l. acidophilus ibb 801, l. amylovorus dce 471, l. casei shirota and l. rhamnosus gg was solely due to the production of lactic acid. the antibacterial activity of l. johnsonii la1 and l. plantarum aca-dc 287 was due to the production of lactic acid and (an) unknown inhibitory substance(s). the latter was (were) only active in the presence of lactic acid. in addition, the lactic acid produced was responsible for significant inhibitory activity upon invasion of salmonella into caco-2/tc7 cells.
a lactobacillus acidophilus strain of human gastrointestinal microbiota origin elicits killing of enterovirulent salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium by triggering lethal bacterial membrane damage.
the human gastrointestinal microbiota produces antagonistic activities against gastrointestinal bacterial pathogens. we undertook a study to investigate the mechanism(s) by which a lactobacillus acidophilus strain of human microbiota origin antagonizes the gram-negative enteroinvasive pathogen salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. we showed that the cell-free culture supernatant of l. acidophilus strain lb (lb-cfcs) induced the following effects in s. enterica sl1344: (i) a decrease in intracellular atp that paralleled bacterial death, (ii) the release of lipopolysaccharide, (iii) permeabilization of the bacterial membrane, and (iv) an increase in the sensitivity of salmonella to the lytic action of sodium dodecyl sulfate. finally, we showed using two mutant strains of salmonella, phop ms7953s and pmra jks1170, that the two-component regulatory systems phop-phoq and pmra-pmrb that regulate the mechanisms of resistance to antibacterial agents in salmonella did not influence the anti-salmonella effect of lb-cfcs.
