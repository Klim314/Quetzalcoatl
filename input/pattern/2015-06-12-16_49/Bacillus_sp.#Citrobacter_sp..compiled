TI  - Antibacterial activity of ovary extract from sea urchin Diadema setosum.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sea urchin gonad is considered as a highly prized delicacy in several  countries. It is also rich in valuable bioactive compounds including polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and beta-carotene. This study was undertaken to examine the antimicrobial properties of the ovary extract from sea urchin Diadema setosum against selected Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ovary extract was obtained using two different solvents such as methanol and chloroform. The obtained extract was used to examine its potential antimicrobial properties against the following 11 bacterial species using the disc diffusion method: Gram-negative bacteria (Salmonella typhi, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aeromonas hydrophila, Acinetobacter sp, Citrobacter freundii and Klebsiella pneumonia) and Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus). The activity was measured in terms of zone of inhibition (mm). RESULTS: The methanol extract exhibited a higher zone of inhibition against all the bacteria taken for examination. Whereas, the ovary extract obtained by chloroform did not show any antimicrobial activity against S. typhi, S. epidermidis, C. freundii and K. pneumonia. The results indicated that the ovary extract obtained by methanol extracts are capable of inhibiting the growth of pathogenic microbes taken for analysis. Moreover, the result indicates the presence of antimicrobial agents in sea urchin ovary. CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that the ovary extract of D. setosum may be a potential source of antimicrobial agent for pathogenic microorganisms.
TI  - [Selective-differential nutrient medium "Shewanella IRHLS agar" for isolation of  Shewanella genus bacteria].
AB  - AIM: Development of a selective-differential nutrient medium for isolation of Shewanella genus bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 73 strains of Shewanella bacteria (S. algae--3, S. baltica--26, S. putrefaciens--44) and 80 strains of 22 other bacteria genera were used. Shewanella species were identified by methods and criteria proposed by Nozue H. et al., 1992; Khashe S. et al., 1998. RESULTS: Nutrient media "Shewanella IRHLS Agar" for shewanella isolation was developed. Medium selective factors: irgazan DP-300 (I). 0.14-0.2 g/l and rifampicin (R) 0.0005-0.001 g/l. Shevanella colonies were detected by the production of hydrogen sulfide (H), lipase presence (L), lack of sorbitol fermentation (S). The medium suppressed the growth of hydrogen sulfide producers (Salmonella, Proteus) and blocked hydrogen sulfide production by Citrobacter. Growth of Escherichia, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Shigella, Staphylococcus, Bacillus was also suppressed, Analytical sensitivity of the medium was 1-2 CFU/ml for Shewanella and Stenotrophomonas, Aerombnas, Serratia genera bacteria. 72 strains of Shewanella were isolated from water of Neva river in this medium, 91.7 +/- 3.2% of those produced H2S. 1 strain of S. algae was isolated from clinical material. CONCLUSION: The developed media allows to use it in a complex for Stenotrophomo- nas sp., Aeromonas sp., Serratia sp., Citrobactersp. and Shewanella bacteria isolation.
TI  - Resistance and inactivation kinetics of bacterial strains isolated from the non-chlorinated and chlorinated effluents of a WWTP.
AB  - The microbiological quality of water from a wastewater treatment plant that uses  sodium hypochlorite as a disinfectant was assessed. Mesophilic aerobic bacteria were not removed efficiently. This fact allowed for the isolation of several bacterial strains from the effluents. Molecular identification indicated that the strains were related to Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli (three strains), Enterobacter cloacae, Kluyvera cryocrescens (three strains), Kluyvera intermedia, Citrobacter freundii (two strains), Bacillus sp. and Enterobacter sp. The first five strains, which were isolated from the non-chlorinated effluent, were used to test resistance to chlorine disinfection using three sets of variables: disinfectant concentration (8, 20 and 30 mg.L(-1)), contact time (0, 15 and 30 min) and water temperature (20, 25 and 30 degrees C). The results demonstrated that the strains have independent responses to experimental conditions and that the most efficient treatment was an 8 mg.L(-1) dose of disinfectant at a temperature of 20 degrees C for 30 min. The other eight strains, which were isolated from the chlorinated effluent, were used to analyze inactivation kinetics using the disinfectant at a dose of 15 mg.L(-1) with various retention times (0, 10, 20, 30, 60 and 90 min). The results indicated that during the inactivation process, there was no relationship between removal percentage and retention time and that the strains have no common response to the treatments.
TI  - Conjunctival microbial florae in patients with seriously sulfur mustard induced eye injuries.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Ocular surface disorders and infections in sulfur mustard (SM) exposed patients are of particular clinical importance. The aim of the present study is to detect the conjunctival bacterial florae in patients with seriously SM induced eye injuries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Conjunctival bacterial florae of 143 seriously eye injured subjects as the study group was detected. The results were compared with 26 normal participants. Both groups were matched in age and sex. The samples were taken by sterile swab from interior fornixes of conjunctiva in both groups and were transported to microbiology laboratory by Stuart's Transport Medium. All samples were inoculated onto Blood agar, Mac Conkey agar and Chocolate agar and isolated microorganisms were identified by biochemical tests. The data were analyzed by SPSS and Man Whitney tests. RESULTS: Nineteen cases (13.39%) and none of the controls (0%) had positive culture results (p = .043). Isolated microorganisms from patients included coagulase-negative staphylococci 10 cases (52.6%), Staphylococcus aureus 5 cases (26.3%), non enterobacteriaceae gram negative bacilli 2 cases (10.5%), Penicillium spp. 2 cases (10.5%), Citrobacter sp. 1 case (5.2%), non-spore forming Gram positive bacillus 1 case (5.2%) and alpha hemolytic streptococcus 1 case (5.2%). Two patients had mixed microorganisms and other patients had just one microorganism. Most of the S. aureus isolates were sensitive to usual antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed that the prevalence rate of conjunctival bacterial isolates in patients with seriously SM induced ocular injuries are higher and potentially more dangerous than normal controls.
TI  - [Analysis of microorganism species diversity in plant intercropping models in a wetland system constructed for treatment of municipal sewage].
AB  - The selective culture method and PCR-DGGE technology were applied to analyze the  number and the biodiversity of microorganism species in cells with plant intercropping models and without plants in different seasons in a wetland system constructed for treatment of municipal sewage. The results showed that the numbers of microorganisms were considerably larger in the cells with plant intercropping models than those without plants, while the number of microorganisms was apparently larger in summer than that in winter in all treatments. Along the three-sequenced treatment cells with plant intercropping models a "low-high-low" changing trend in the numbers of microorganisms in summer. The UPGMA cluster analysis showed that the treatments in the same season were clustered in the same branch except for a few samples in winter and the biodiversity index was consistently higher in summer than that in winter. Five different sequences (DF1-DF5) were obtained through BLAST analysis and retrieval. The closest known origin groups were located as Escherichia coli, Citrobacter sp., Proteus sp., Klebsiella oxytoca, and Burkholderia sp. respectively. The BLASTX comparison test showed that DF1 closely related to the activities of the Mycobacterium bacillus and the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, DF2 functioned as a conservative potential ATP binding protein, DF3 related to the activities of the Bacillus cereus spore, DF4 was involved in catabolism metabolism of microorganism and DF5 played an important role in decomposition of organic matters.
TI  - Bioreactor-based bioremediation of hydrocarbon-polluted Niger Delta marine sediment, Nigeria.
AB  - Crude oil-polluted marine sediment from Bonny River loading jetty Port Harcourt,  Nigeria was treated in seven 2.5 l stirred-tank bioreactors designated BNPK, BNK5, BPD, BNO(3), BUNa, BAUT, and BUK over a 56-day period. Five bioreactors were biostimulated with either K(2)HPO(4), NH(4)NO(3), (NH(4))(2)SO(4), NPK, urea or poultry droppings while unamended (BUNa) and heat-killed (BAUT) treatments were controls. For each bioreactor, 1 kg (wet weight) sediment amended with 1 l seawater were spiked with 20 ml and 20 mg of crude oil and anthracene which gave a total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) range of 106.4-116 ppm on day 0. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in all spiked sediment slurry ranged from 96.6 to 104.4 ppm. TPH in each treatment was </=14.9 ppm while PAH was </=6.8 ppm by day 56. Treatment BNO(3) recorded highest heterotrophic bacterial count (9.8 x 10(8) cfu/g) and hydrocarbon utilizers (1.15 x 10(8) cfu/g). By day 56, the percentages of biodegradation of PAHs, as measured with GC-FID were BNK5 (97.93%), BNPK (98.38%), BUK (98.82%), BUNa (98.13%), BAUT (93.08%), BPD (98.92%), and BNO(3) (98.02%). BPD gave the highest degradation rate for PAH. TPH degradation rates were as follows: BNK5 (94.50%), BNPK (94.77%), BUK (94.10%), BUNa (94.77%), BAUT (75.04%), BPD (95.35%), BNO(3) (95.54%). Fifty-six hydrocarbon utilizing bacterial isolates obtained were Micrococcus spp. 5 (9.62%), Staphylococcus spp. 3 (5.78%), Pseudomonas spp. 7 (13.46%), Citrobacter sp. 1 (1.92%), Klebsiella sp. 1 (1.92%), Corynebacterium spp. 5 (9.62%), Bacillus spp. 5 (9.62%), Rhodococcus spp. 7 (13.46%), Alcanivorax spp. 7 (13.46%), Alcaligenes sp. 1 (1.92%), Serratia spp. 2 (3.85%), Arthrobacter spp. 7 (13.46%), Nocardia spp. 2 (3.85%), Flavobacterium sp. 1 (1.92%), Escherichia sp. 1 (1.92%), Acinetobacter sp. 1 (1.92%), Proteus sp. 1 (1.92%) and unidentified bacteria 10 (17%). These results indicate that the marine sediment investigated is amenable to bioreactor-based bioremediation and that abiotic factors also could contribute to hydrocarbon attenuation as recorded in the heat-killed (BAUT) control.
TI  - Nitrous oxide production in soil isolates of nitrate-ammonifying bacteria.
AB  - Here we provide the first demonstration of the potential for N2 O production by soil-isolated nitrate-ammonifying bacteria under different C and N availabilities, building on characterizations informed from model strains. The potential for soil-isolated Bacillus sp. and Citrobacter sp. to reduce NO3 (-) , and produce NH4 (+) , NO2 (-) and N2 O was examined in batch and continuous (chemostat) cultures under different C-to-NO3 (-) ratios, NO3 (-) -limiting (5 mM) and NO3 (-) -sufficient (22 mM) conditions. C-to-NO3 (-) ratio had a major influence on the products of nitrate ammonification, with NO2 (-) , rather than NH4 (+) , being the major product at low C-to-NO3 (-) ratios in batch cultures. N2 O production was maximum and accompanied by high NO2 (-) production under C-limitation/NO3 -sufficiency conditions in chemostat cultures. In media with lower C-to-NO3 -N ratios (5- and 10-to-1) up to 2.7% or 5.0% of NO3 (-) was reduced to N2 O by Bacillus sp. and Citrobacter sp., respectively, but these reduction efficiencies were only 0.1% or 0.7% at higher C-to-NO3 (-) ratios (25- and 50-to-1). As the highest N2 O production did not occur under the same C-to-NO3 (-) conditions as highest NH4 (+) production we suggest that a re-evaluation may be necessary of the environmental conditions under which nitrate ammonification contributes to N2 O emission from soil.
TI  - Akara Ogbomoso: microbiological examination and identification of hazards and critical control points.
AB  - Akara Ogbomoso was examined toward the establishment of hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP). The akara was produced in residential buildings with the attendant consequence of contamination. There was ample growth of aerobes, coliforms, staphylococci, Shigella and yeast/mold from the samples, water and cowpea pastes. Microbial contaminations occur through the processing, which can be corrected through education by adopting good hygienic and manufacturing practices. The critical control points were identified as frying, storage and refrying. It may be heated in the microwave for 10 s before consumption. Akara, prepared in the laboratory through the implementation of HACCP was not contaminated. Several bacterial isolates, namely; Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus sp. and Shigella sp., showed multiple resistance to antibiotics ranging from two to nine. Seven strains were not resistant to the antibiotics, while five were resistant to one type of antibiotic.
TI  - Isolation of a selected microbial consortium capable of degrading methyl parathion and p-nitrophenol from a contaminated soil site.
AB  - A bacterial consortium with the ability to degrade methyl parathion and p-nitrophenol, using these compounds as the only carbon source, was obtained by selective enrichment in a medium with methyl parathion. Samples were taken from Moravia, Medellin; an area that is highly contaminated, owing to the fact that it was used as a garbage dump from 1974 to 1982. Acinetobacter sp, Pseudomonas putida, Bacillus sp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa Citrobacter freundii, Stenotrophomonas sp, Flavobacterium sp, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas sp, Acinetobacter sp, Klebsiella sp and Proteus sp were the microorganisms identified within the consortium. In culture, the consortium was able to degrade 150 mg L(-)(1) of methyl-parathion and p-nitrophenol in 120 h, but after adding glucose or peptone to the culture, the time of degradation decreased to 24 h. In soil, the consortium was also able to degrade 150 mg L(-)(1) of methyl parathion in 120 h at different depths and also managed to decrease the toxicity.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of bacteria from the gut of Bombyx mori that degrade cellulose, xylan, pectin and starch and their impact on digestion.
AB  - Bombyx mori L. (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae) have been domesticated and widely used for silk production. It feeds on mulberry leaves. Mulberry leaves are mainly composed of pectin, xylan, cellulose and starch. Some of the digestive enzymes that degrade these carbohydrates might be produced by gut bacteria. Eleven isolates were obtained from the digestive tract of B. mori, including the Gram positive Bacillus circulans and Gram negative Proteus vulgaris, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia liquefaciens, Enterobacter sp., Pseudomonas fluorescens, P. aeruginosa, Aeromonas sp., and Erwinia sp.. Three of these isolates, P. vulgaris, K. pneumoniae, C. freundii, were cellulolytic and xylanolytic, P. fluorescens and Erwinia sp., were pectinolytic and K. pneumoniae degraded starch. Aeromonas sp. was able to utilize the CMcellulose and xylan. S. liquefaciens was able to utilize three polysaccharides including CMcellulose, xylan and pectin. B. circulans was able to utilize all four polysaccharides with different efficacy. The gut of B. mori has an alkaline pH and all of the isolated bacterial strains were found to grow and degrade polysaccharides at alkaline pH. The number of cellulolytic bacteria increases with each instar.
TI  - Production of antimicrobial silver nanoparticles in water extracts of the fungus  Amylomyces rouxii strain KSU-09.
AB  - A fungal strain, KSU-09, isolated from the roots of date palm (Phoenix dactylifera), was identified as Amylomyces rouxii based on sequence analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of its rRNA genes. Mycelia-free water extracts obtained from mycelium suspended in water for 72h facilitated the production of stable, predominantly monodispersed and spherical silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in the size range of 5-27nm upon addition of 1mM silver nitrate, as determined by the XRD, AFM and TEM. The AgNPs exhibited antimicrobial activity against Shigella dysenteriae type I, Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter sp., Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans and Fusarium oxysporum. Thus, the strain KSU-09 could be used for simple, non-hazardous and efficient synthesis of antimicrobial AgNPs.
TI  - A survey of veterinary hospitals in Nigeria for the presence of some bacterial organisms of nosocomial and zoonotic potential.
AB  - This study was undertaken to determine the type and estimate the prevalence of bacterial organisms on contact surfaces of five close-to-patient facilities in three veterinary health care settings within the Sokoto metropolis of north-western Nigeria. A total of 30 samples (10 from each setting) were collected and analysed using culture, microscopy and biochemical testing. Bacterial species isolated from samples in this study included the following: Bacillus sp. (27.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (15.9%), Listeria sp. (13.6%), Streptococcus sp. (11.4%), Salmonella sp. (6.8%), Escherichia coli (4.5%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (4.5%), Citrobacter sp. (2.3%), Klebsiella sp. (2.3%), Lactobacillus sp. (2.3%), Micrococcus sp. (2.3%), Pasteurella sp. (2.3%), Proteus sp. (2.3%), and Yersinia sp. (2.3%). A higher percentage (64.3%) of the total bacterial isolates were zoonotic in nature and hence of public health significance. Some pathogens have the potential of nosocomial spread. In this study, we seek to establish the first evidence of bacterial presence in the major veterinary health care settings in the Sokoto region of north-western Nigeria. Of particular interest is the hypothesis, which has not previously been formally tested, that nosocomial infections are especially likely to be implicated in both animals and occupational diseases in Nigeria. It was suggested that some of these isolates were associated with the risk of nosocomial and zoonotic infections and hence draws attention to the need to rigorously employ standard veterinary precautions as part of the hospital's infection control programme in an attempt to protect both patients and staff from infections.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of lactic acid bacteria community SFC-2 used for fermentation of air-dried crop straws].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antibacterial activity of lactic acid bacteria community SFC-2 in fermented crop straw. METHODS: Total 13 isolates were obtained from spontaneous fermented rice straw by plating, paper diffusion and Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis. All these strains were used to determine the antibacterial activity of SFC-2. RESULTS: (1) Phylogenetic analysis of the 13 strains based on 16S rDNA gene sequence data indicated that 9 strains belong to Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacterfreundii, Klebsiella terrigena and Citrobacter sp., which were all common pathogens or opportunistic pathogens. (2) Indicating bacteria selected from the pathogens were used to detect antibacterial activity of SFC-2 cell-free culture supernatant. The results showed that: SFC-2 community had stronger antibacterial activity than isolated strains from SFC-2 community or man-made communities against indicating bacteria. (3) Antibacterial activities of seven different cell-free culture supernatants, which were extracted at intervals from the culture of SFC-2 community during 14-48 hours, were no obvious difference, but the content of organic acids were obvious differences during 14-48 hours; the antibacterial substances were stable after heating and sensitive partly to protease K.
TI  - A rapid and efficient method for cloning genes of type II restriction-modification systems by use of a killer plasmid.
AB  - We present a method for cloning restriction-modification (R-M) systems that is based on the use of a lethal plasmid (pKILLER). The plasmid carries a functional gene for a restriction endonuclease having the same DNA specificity as the R-M system of interest. The first step is the standard preparation of a representative, plasmid-borne genomic library. Then this library is transformed with the killer plasmid. The only surviving bacteria are those which carry the gene specifying a protective DNA methyltransferase. Conceptually, this in vivo selection approach resembles earlier methods in which a plasmid library was selected in vitro by digestion with a suitable restriction endonuclease, but it is much more efficient than those methods. The new method was successfully used to clone two R-M systems, BstZ1II from Bacillus stearothermophilus 14P and Csp231I from Citrobacter sp. strain RFL231, both isospecific to the prototype HindIII R-M system.
TI  - Antifungal and antibacterial activities of Araucaria araucana (Mol.) K. Koch heartwood lignans.
AB  - Five lignans (secoisolariciresinol, pinoresinol, eudesmin, lariciresinol, and lariciresinol-4-methyl ether) were isolated from an MeOH extract from Araucaria araucana (Mol.) K. Koch wood for the first time in this species and their structures determined with spectroscopic methods. The antimicrobial activities of these compounds were determined for the bacteria Citrobacter sp., Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and for the white rooting and staining fungi Mucor miehei, Paecilomyces variotii, Ceratocystis pilifera, Trametes versicolor, and Penicillium notatum, and in addition, the MeOH extract was evaluated against Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans, Fusarium moniliforme, F. sporotrichum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. The most sensitive bacteria against pinoresinol were the Gram-positive. However, secoisolariciresinol exhibited a significant antifungal activity on fungi of white rooting and wood staining and this compound completely inhibited the mycelial growth of T. versicolor and C. pilifera at 300 and 400 microg per disc, respectively, whereas pinoresinol showed a moderate inhibitory activity. On the other hand, the MeOH extract had the highest activity against rooting and staining and pathogenic fungi as well as T. versicolor, Fusarium spp. and Trichophyton mentagrophytes, inhibiting completely the growth at 400 microg per disc.
TI  - Identification of nif genes in N2-fixing bacterial strains isolated from rice fields along the Yangtze River Plain.
AB  - The aim of this research was to identify nifH and nifHDKYE ' genes in twenty strains of N2-fixing heterotrophic bacteria isolated from rice fields in the Yangtze River Plain. Southern hybridization of the total DNA from each strain was performed with the Klebsiella pneumoniae nifHDKYE ' gene probe (6.2 kb Eco RI fragment from pSA30) and the Azospirillum brasilense nifH gene probe (0.6 kb Eco RI-Hin dIII fragment from pHU8). We found that Eco RI fragments of total DNA from Aeromonas hydrophila HY2, Bacillus azotoformans FD, Bacillus licheniformis NCH1, NCH5, WH4, Bacillus brevis NC2, Bacillus pumilus NC12, Bacillus cereus NCH2, Citrobacter freundii HY5, HY9, Derxia gummosa HZ5, Pseudomonas mendocina HZ1 and Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes WH3 were positively hybridized with both of the probes. Agrobacterium radiobacter HY17, Corynebacterium sp. HY12, YZ and Pseudomonas sp. HY11 had Eco RI fragments hybridized with the K. pneumoniae nifHDKYE ' gene probe. An Eco RI fragment of total DNA from Bacillus megaterium YY4 was positively hybridized to the A. brasilense nifH gene probe. No hybridization sign was found in the total DNA fragments from Alcaligenes cupidus YY6 and Corynebacterium sp. NC11 hybridized with either of the gene probes. The data provide the number and size of EcoRI fragments of the total DNA hybridized with the nif gene probes for these strains of rarely studied species, suggesting additional evidence for N2 fixing and nif gene diversity of N2-fixing bacteria in rice fields along the Yangtze River Plain.
TI  - Treatment of dairy wastewater using a selected bacterial isolate, Alcaligenes sp. MMRR7.
AB  - Physicochemical and biologic analysis of dairy wastewater showed that the effluent had a high organic load (chemical oxygen demand [COD]: 5095 mg/L), an acidic pH (6.4), and a high probability of coliforms (most probable number [MPN] >1100). The various bacterial strains isolated and purified were identified as Sporolactobacillus sp., Citrobacter sp., Pseudomonas sp., Alcaligenes sp., Bacillus sp., Staphylococcus sp., and Proteus sp., as per the Bergey's manual of systematic bacteriology. Among the five selected bacterial strains, the strain designated as MMRR7 and identified as Alcaligenes sp. was found to give a maximum reduction in COD (62%) in 5 d of incubation. Chemical coagulation using alum at a concentration of 0.5 g/100 mL was found to be effective in the primary treatment of the effluent. Studies on free-cell treatment of the coagulated effluent with the selected bacterial strain Alcaligenes sp. MMRR7 gave a maximum COD reduction of 91% in 120 h. This study clearly indicates the possibility of using Alcaligenes sp. MMRR7 for the effective treatment of dairy wastewater.
TI  - Reduction of Cr(VI) and bioaccumulation of chromium by gram positive and gram negative microorganisms not previously exposed to Cr-stress.
AB  - Resistance to Cr(VI) is usually associated with its cellular exclusion, precluding enrichment techniques for the isolation of organisms accumulating Cr(VI) via bioreduction to insoluble Cr(III). A technique was developed to screen for potential Cr(VI) reduction in approx. 2000 isolates from a coastal environment, based on the non-specific reduction of selenite and tellurite to Se0 and Te0, and reduction of tetrazolium blue to insoluble blue formazan. The most promising strains were further screened in liquid culture, giving three, which were identified by 16S rRNA sequence analysis as Bacillus pumilus, Exiguobacterium aurantiacum and Pseudomonas synxantha, all of which reduced 100 microM Cr(VI) anaerobically, without growth. The respective removal of Cr(VI) was 90% and 80% by B. pumilus and E. aurantiacum after 48 h and 80% and by P. synxantha after 192 h. With the gram positive strains Cr(VI) promoted loss of flagella and, in the case of B. pumilus, lysis of some cells, but Cr was deposited as an exocellular precipitate which was identified as containing Cr and P using energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis (EDAX). This prompted the testing of Citrobacter sp. N14 (subsequently re-assigned by 16S rRNA sequence analysis and biochemical studies as a strain of Serratia) which bioprecipitates metal cation phosphates via enzymatically-liberated phosphate. This strain reduced Cr(VI) at a rate comparable to that of P. synxantha but Cr(III) was not bioprecipitated where La(III) was removed as LaPO4, even though a similar amount of phosphate was produced in the presence of Cr(III). Since B. pumilus removed most of the Cr(VI), with the formation of cell-bound CrPO4 implicated, this suggests that this strain could have future bioprocess potential.
TI  - Cost-effective and rapid presumptive identification of gram-negative bacilli in routine urine, pus, and stool cultures: evaluation of the use of CHROMagar orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests.
AB  - The algorithm for a new identification system was designed on the basis of colony color and morphology on CHROMagar Orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests such as indole (IND), lysine decarboxylase (LDC), and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) utilization tests with gram-negative bacilli isolated from urine samples as well as pus, stool, and other clinical specimens by the following colony characteristics, biochemical reactions, and serological results: pinkish to red, IND positive (IND(+)), Escherichia coli; metallic blue, IND(+), LDC(+), and ODC negative (ODC(-)), Klebsiella oxytoca; IND(+), LDC(-), and ODC(+), Citrobacter diversus; IND(+) or IND(-), LDC(-), and ODC(-), Citrobacter freundii; IND(-), LDC(+), and ODC(+), Enterobacter aerogenes; IND(-), LDC(-), and ODC(+), Enterobacter cloacae; IND(-), LDC(+), and ODC(-), Klebsiella pneumoniae; diffuse brown and IND(+), Morganella morganii; IND(-), Proteus mirabilis; aqua blue, Serratia marcescens; bluish green and IND(+), Proteus vulgaris; transparent yellow-green, serology positive, Pseudomonas aeruginosa; clear and serology positive, Salmonella sp.; other colors and reactions, the organism was identified by the full identification methods. The accuracy and cost-effectiveness of this new system were prospectively evaluated. During an 8-month period, a total of 345 specimens yielded one or more gram-negative bacilli. A total of 472 gram-negative bacillus isolates were detected on CHROMagar Orientation medium. For 466 of the isolates (98.7%), no discrepancies in the results were obtained on the basis of the identification algorithm. The cost of identification of gram-negative bacilli during this period was reduced by about 70%. The results of this trial for the differentiation of the most commonly encountered gram-negative pathogens in clinical specimens with the new algorithm were favourable in that it permitted reliable detection and presumptive identification. In addition, this rapid identification system not only significantly reduced costs but it also improved the daily work flow within the clinical microbiology laboratory.
TI  - Monoclonal antibodies that react with live Listeria spp.
AB  - Seven monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against Listeria spp. that were reactive with  live Listeria spp. were developed. Two of these MAbs (55-8 and 55-37) were members of the immunoglobulin M class, and all other MAbs were members of the immunoglobulin G class. MAb 55-23 reacted with 148 of 157 strains tested. MAb 34-51 reacted with serotype 1/2a, 1/2b, and 1/2c strains and exhibited a scattered reaction pattern with strains belonging to other serotypes. MAb 55-44 reacted with all of the strains belonging to serotype 4b tested. MAb 55-4 reacted with all of the serotype 1/2a isolates tested, although reactivity with other isolates also was observed. The other MAbs exhibited scattered reaction patterns. No correlation of reactivity pattern with serotype was found. Marked differences were observed between the reactivities of MAbs as determined by a magnetic immunoluminescence assay and a whole-cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Only MAb 55-23 exhibited minor reactivity with three Streptococcus spp. isolates, while no reactivity was observed with six Bacillus spp. strains, one Escherichia coli strain, and one Citrobacter sp. strain. In Western blots (immunoblots) MAbs 55-23, 55-44, and 34-9 exhibited reactivity; all other MAbs were negative in this assay.
TI  - Role of Ser-238 and Lys-240 in the hydrolysis of third-generation cephalosporins  by SHV-type beta-lactamases probed by site-directed mutagenesis and three-dimensional modeling.
AB  - A growing number of extended spectrum SHV-type beta-lactamases capable of hydrolyzing third-generation cephalosporins such as cefotaxime and ceftazidime have been reported. These new enzymes differ by a few amino acids from SHV-1, an enzyme incapable of hydrolyzing these drugs. Two of these substitutions, Gly-238-->Ser and Glu-240-->Lys, are in a key beta-strand of the catalytic site of class A beta-lactamases. To understand the structural basis of these new activities, we first subcloned the DNA region coding for SHV-1 and SHV-2 and did site-directed mutagenesis to create two mutant SHV-1 proteins containing Ser and Glu or Gly and Lys and two mutant SHV-2 proteins containing Gly and Glu or Ser and Lys in positions 238 and 240, respectively. Phenotypic analysis (antibiograms and minimum inhibitory concentrations) and activity spectra of mutant enzymes showed that Ser-238 is critical for cefotaxime hydrolysis whereas both Ser-238 and Lys-240 are needed for strong ceftazidime hydrolysis. A three-dimensional model for SHV beta-lactamase complexes was constructed using the crystallographic structure of the homologous Bacillus licheniformis beta-lactamase, the complex of cefotaxime with the Streptomyces sp. R61 D-alanyl-D-alanine peptidase, and the complex of aztreonam with the Citrobacter freundii beta-lactamase. The modeling of SHV beta-lactamase complexes showed that factors which are most likely to correlate with binding and kinetic data are the size of the relatively buried amino acid at position 238 and the electrostatic charge of the exposed group at position 240.
TI  - Bacteriological study of extracted IUCDs.
AB  
TI  - Isolations of aerobic bacteria from wild desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni and O. c. mexicana) in Arizona.
AB  - Nasal, pharyngeal, cervical and vaginal swab specimens were obtained from 74 desert bighorn sheep for the purpose of investigating the normal aerobic bacterial flora of wild sheep. A total of 281 isolates was obtained and identified by standard microbiologic tests. One hundred seven of these isolates were gram positive and included Bacillus sp. (36%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (8%), S. aureus (4%), Corynebacterium sp. (diphtheroids, 4%), and Streptococcus sp. (48%). gram negative isolates totaled 174 and included Neisseria sp. (18%), Citrobacter sp. (3%), Enterobacter sp. (2%), Escherichia coli (2%), Proteus sp. (2%) and non-fermentative bacilli (NFB) (73%). Of the NFB isolates, Pseudomonas sp. (25%), Acinetobacter sp. (18%), Moraxella sp. (15%) were identified.
TI  - Microbial activity of trench leachates from shallow-land, low-level radioactive waste disposal sites.
AB  - Trench leachate samples collected anoxically from shallow-land, low-level radioactive waste disposal sites were analyzed for total aerobic and anaerobic populations, sulfate reducers, denitrifiers, and methanogens. Among the several aerobic and anaerobic bacteria isolated, only Bacillus sp., Pseudomonas sp., Citrobacter sp., and Clostridium sp. were identified. Mixed bacterial cultures isolated from the trench leachates were able to grow anaerobically in trench leachates, which indicates that the radionuclides and organic chemicals present were not toxic to these bacteria. Changes in concentrations of several of the organic constituents of the waste leachate samples were observed due to anaerobic microbial activity. Growth of a mixed culture of trench-water bacteria in media containing a mixture of radionuclides, 60Co, 85Sr, and 134,137Cs, was not affected at total activity concentrations of 2.6 X 10(2) and 2.7 X 10(3) pCi/ml.
TI  - Biological values of the infant, juvenile, and adult agouti (Dasyprocta sp) with  emphasis on microbial flora.
AB  - Normal values for intestinal flora were determined on four adult, two juvenile, and four infant agoutis (Dasyprocta sp) maintained at our institution. Serologic, hematologic, biochemical, and histologic observations were also made on these same agoutis, and serologic, microbiologic, and endoparasitic tests were made on serum and fecal samples from agoutis maintained at other institutions. Streptococci, lactobacilli and nonenteropathogenic Escherichia coli were isolated from cecal contents of all age groups. Gaffkya tetragena and Bacillus sp were recovered from infant agoutis, Proteus mirabilis from juvenile agoutis, and Proteus mirabilis and Micrococcus sp from adult agoutis. Infant agoutis showed marginal antibody titers to reovirus type 3 and Toolan's H-1 viruses, and Theiler's GDVII antibodies were detected in juvenile agoutis, but no antibody titers to murine viruses were found in the adult agoutis maintained at our institution. Hematologic, biochemical, and histologic data for these agoutis were comparable to those of other hystricomorph rodents. Serologic tests of the agoutis maintained at other institutions disclosed antibodies for GDVII virus in all of 17 animals tested, while marginal titers were found for Sendai virus in four and for reovirus type 3 in eight of the 17 animals. Only low incidences of pathogenic bacteria (Salmonella, Pseudomonas, and Citrobacter) were isolated from the agoutis maintained elsewhere. The endoparasites found in these agoutis were Ascaris, Toxascaris, Strongyloides, Trichuris, and Trichomonas.
