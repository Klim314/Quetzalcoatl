TI  - Altered bacterial profiles in saliva from adults with caries lesions: a case-cohort study.
AB  - The aim of this study was to learn whether presence of caries in an adult population was associated with a salivary bacterial profile different from that of individuals without untreated caries. Stimulated saliva samples from 621 participants of the Danish Health Examination Survey were analyzed using the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray technology. Samples from 174 individuals with dental caries and 447 from a control cohort were compared using frequency and levels of identified bacterial taxa/clusters as endpoints. Differences at taxon/cluster level were analyzed using Mann-Whitney's test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple comparisons. Principal component analysis was used to visualize bacterial community profiles. A reduced bacterial diversity was observed in samples from subjects with dental caries. Five bacterial taxa (Veillonella parvula, Veillonella atypica, Megasphaera micronuciformis, Fusobacterium periodontium and Achromobacter xylosoxidans) and one bacterial cluster (Leptotrichia sp. clones C3MKM102 and GT018_ot417/462) were less frequently found in the caries group (adjusted p value <0.01) while two bacterial taxa (Solobacterium moorei and Streptococcus salivarius) and three bacterial clusters (Streptococcus parasanguinis I and II and sp. clone BE024_ot057/411/721, Streptococcus parasanguinis I and II and sinensis_ot411/721/767, Streptococcus salivarius and sp. clone FO042_ot067/755) were present at significantly higher levels (adjusted p value <0.01). The principal component analysis displayed a marked difference in the bacterial community profiles between groups. Presence of manifest caries was associated with a reduced diversity and an altered salivary bacterial community profile. Our data support recent theories that ecological stress-induced changes of commensal microbial communities are involved in the shift from oral health to tooth decay.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of some Sporomusa sub-branch members isolated from human clinical specimens: description of Megasphaera micronuciformis sp. nov.
AB  - Two unknown, Gram-negative, catalase-negative and strictly anaerobic cocci were isolated from two independent human samples (strains AIP 49.01 and AIP 412.00T). Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing demonstrated that these two organisms displayed 99.8% sequence identity and that they are members of the Sporomusa sub-branch of the low-G + C Gram-positive bacteria. The most closely related 16S rDNA sequences were from Megasphaera sp. oral clone BU057 (99.8%) and from isolates of Megasphaera cerevisiae and Megasphaera elsdenii (94.5 and 93.8%, respectively). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rDNA sequences showed that these two strains were most closely related to M. elsdenii and belonged to the Megasphaera genus. Differences from previously described Megasphaera species in terms of size, biochemical tests (particularly the analysis of metabolic end products), gas production and DNA G+C content indicated that the two strains studied represent a novel species of anaerobic Gram-negative cocci. The name Megasphaera micronuciformis sp. nov. is proposed for these two isolates. It is also proposed that the uncultured organism previously deposited as Megasphaera sp. oral clone BU057 should be named 'Candidatus Megasphaera micronuciformis'. The type strain of Megasphaera micronuciformis is AIP 412.00T (=CIP 107280T =CCUG 45952T).
