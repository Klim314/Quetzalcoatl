antibacterial activity of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids against propionibacterium acnes and staphylococcus aureus.
new compounds are needed to treat acne and superficial infections caused by propionibacterium acnes and staphylococcus aureus due to the reduced effectiveness of agents used at present. long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (lc-pufas) are attracting attention as potential new topical treatments for gram-positive infections due to their antimicrobial potency and anti-inflammatory properties. this present study aimed to investigate the antimicrobial effects of six lc-pufas against p. acnes and s. aureus to evaluate their potential to treat infections caused by these pathogens. minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined against p. acnes and s. aureus, and the lc-pufas were found to inhibit bacterial growth at 32-1024 mg/l. generally, p. acnes was more susceptible to the growth inhibitory actions of lc-pufas, but these compounds were bactericidal only for s. aureus. this is the first report of antibacterial activity attributed to 15-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (15-ohepa) and 15-hydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (hetre), while the anti-p. acnes effects of the six lc-pufas used herein are novel observations. during exposure to the lc-pufas, s. aureus cells were killed within 15-30 min. checkerboard assays demonstrated that the lc-pufas did not antagonise the antimicrobial potency of clinical agents used presently against p. acnes and s. aureus. however, importantly, synergistic interactions against s. aureus were detected for combinations of benzoyl peroxide with 15-ohepa, dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (dgla) and hetre; and neomycin with 15-ohepa, dgla, eicosapentaenoic acid, gamma-linolenic acid and hetre. in conclusion, lc-pufas warrant further evaluation as possible new agents to treat skin infections caused by p. acnes and s. aureus, especially in synergistic combinations with antimicrobial agents already used clinically.
role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections.
meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical mrsa isolates, we conducted a literature search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment of s. aureus infection. as summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of s. aureus and clinical isolates of mrsa in vitro. the most active strains were lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, propionibacterium freudenreichii, propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus paracasei, l. acidophilus, l. casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus fermentum and lactococcus lactis. their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. l. acidophilus also inhibited s. aureus biofilm formation and lipase production. in vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. s. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in vitro to l. acidophilus, whilst in vivo bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. on the other hand, l. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against s. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with s. aureus in mice. very few clinical data were found on the interactions between probiotics and mrsa, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of mrsa colonisation with probiotic use.
antityrosinase and antimicrobial activities from thai medicinal plants.
various dermatological disorders and microbial skin infection can cause hyperpigmentation. therefore, screenings for whitening and antimicrobial agents from thai medicinal plants have been of research interest. seventy-seven ethanol plant extracts were investigated for antityrosinase activity, eleven samples showed the tyrosinase inhibition more than 50 % were further preliminary screening for antimicrobial activity by agar disc diffusion and broth micro-dilution methods. artocarpus integer (thunb.) merr. (moraceae) root extract, which showed the potential of tyrosinase inhibition with 90.57 +/- 2.93 % and antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, propionibacterium acnes and trichophyton mentagophytes with inhibition zone as 9.10 +/- 0.00, 10.67 +/- 0.09, 15.25 +/- 0.05 and 6.60 +/- 0.17 mm, respectively was selected for phytochemical investigation. three pure compounds were isolated as artocarpin, cudraflavone c and artocarpanone. and artocarpanone exhibited anti-tyrosinase effect; artocarpin and cudraflavone c also showed the potential of antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis and p. acnes with mic at 2, 4 and 2 mug/ml, respectively and mbc at 32 mug/ml for these bacteria. so, these pure compounds are interesting for further study in order to provide possibilities of new whitening and antibacterial development. this will be the first report of phytochemical investigation of a. integer root.
in vitro evaluation of antibacterial activities and anti-inflammatory effects of  bifidobacterium spp. addressing acne vulgaris.
the objective of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effect of bifidobacterium spp. in the first part of the study, the antibacterial activities of live and sonicated cells, from a total of 23 bifidobacterium species, on the growth of 5 different strain of staphylococcus aureus. six strains, of sonicated bifidobacterium, exhibited antibacterial activity against staphylococci samples, and seven bifidobacterium strains exhibited antibacterial activity on the growth of s. aureus s.p.-n2. in the second part of the study, we tested the antimicrobial activity, of bifidobacterium against propionibacterium acne kctc3320, using the co-culture method. the loss of p. acnes viability, caused by b. adolescentis spm0308 and b. longum spm1207, was 84% and 75%, respectively (*p < 0.05). in the third part of the study, the anti-inflammatory activity of b. adolescentis spm0308 and b. longum spm1207 were assessed; nitric oxide (no), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha), production were tested using the murine macrophage raw 264.7 cell line. treatment of raw 264.7 cells, with bifidobacterium, decreased production of no and tnf-alpha rather than lps (100 ng/ml) treatment. the results suggest that b. adolescentis spm0308 could be used as an effective control for p. acnes kctc3320, and s. aureus, and reduce the risk of acne vulgaris development. we suggest that b. adolescentis spm0308 may be a useful probiotic microorganism, for prevention of acne vulgaris, without adverse effects.
interactions between various microbes and ginseng botanicals.
three kinds of interactions occur between ginseng botanicals and microorganisms:  a) spoilage of the botanical by various fungi (e.g., aspergillus, penicillium, alternaria, and eurotium species) and bacteria; b) transformation of ginsenosides into more bioactive forms by bacteria such as intrasporangium sp. gs603, microbacterium sp. gs514, caulobacter leidyia, bifidobacterium sp. int57, bifidobacterium sp. sj32, fusobacterium sp. and bacteroides sp., and moulds (e.g., aspergillus niger, fusarium sacchari, paecilomyces bainier sp. 229, rhizopus stolonifer, myrothecium verrucaria and acremonium strictum); and c) inhibition of certain bacteria (propionibacterium acnes, porphyromonas gingivalis, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa), fungi (candida albicans, aspergillus fumigatus, fusarium oxysporum) and viruses by ginseng constituents.
sinogenic orbital and subperiosteal abscesses: microbiology and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus incidence.
objective: to assess the current bacteriology and the incidence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus in orbital and subperiosteal abscesses of paranasal sinus disease origin. study design: case series with chart review. setting: an otolaryngology and ophthalmology specialty hospital. subjects and methods: fifty-three patients were treated between 1994 and 2008 for orbital or subperiosteal abscess and paranasal sinusitis, confirmed by imaging and surgical intervention; 46 had operative culture specimens and comprise the study cohort. results: the mean patient age was 28 years; one third were younger than 18. nearly twice as many patients had subperiosteal (n = 30) as had orbital abscesses (n = 16). in 12 patients (26%), cultures were negative or grew only skin flora contaminants (coagulase-negative staphylococci, diphtheroids, and propionibacterium acnes). fifteen patients (33%) grew more than one pathogen. streptococci were isolated in 17 of the 46 cases (37%), s. aureus in 13 (28.3%), gram-negative bacilli in eight (17.4%), and anaerobes in nine (19.6%). methicillin-resistant s. aureus accounted for three (23.1%) of the s. aureus isolates and 6.5 percent of the total cases. conclusion: abscess cultures grew a mixture of bacteria, including gram-positive cocci, gram-negative bacilli, and anaerobes. although streptococci were the most common genus of bacteria isolated, s. aureus was the single most common pathogen recovered and one fourth of these cases were methicillin-resistant s. aureus. given the significant morbidity that may result from inadequate treatment, an antibiotic active against methicillin-resistant s. aureus should be included in the initial broad-spectrum antimicrobial treatment regimen of orbital and subperiosteal abscesses of sinusitis origin until culture results are available.
antimicrobial activity and stability of rhinacanthins-rich rhinacanthus nasutus extract.
rhinacanthins-rich rhinacanthus nasutus (rrn) extract was prepared and standardized to contain total rhinacantins not less than 70% w/w. in this study, antimicrobial activities of the rrn extract as well as rhinacanthin-c against streptococcus mutans, propionibacterium acnes, helicobacter pylori, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis and candida albicans were evaluated by microdilution assay. it was found that the rrn extract exhibited potent bactericidal activity against s. mutans with mic and mbc of 4 microg/ml, and potent bacteriostatic activity against s. epidermidis, p. acnes and s. aureus with the mics of 8-16 microg/ml. however, the rrn extract was not active against c. albicans at concentration up to 2000 microg/ml. the antimicrobial activities of the rrn extract was almost equal to those of rhinacanthin-c. stability evaluations of the rrn extract through a period of 4 months found that the rrn extracts were stable when kept in a well-closed container protected from light and stored either under 4+/-2 degrees c or 30+/-2 degrees c. the rrn extracts that were exposed to light were not stable after 1 week of storage. under accelerated conditions at 45 degrees c with 75% relative humidity, the rrn extracts were not stable after 8 weeks of storage. study on the effect of ph on the stability of the aqueous methanolic solution of the rrn extract found that the solutions were not stable at ph 5.5, ph 7.0, and ph 8.0. however, the rhinacanthin solution at ph 5.5 was more stable than those at ph 7.0 and ph 8.0.
histone h4 is a major component of the antimicrobial action of human sebocytes.
antimicrobial peptides, such as cathelicidin and beta defensins, directly kill microbes and have been detected in human sebaceous glands and cell lines. despite the presence of several such peptides, the apparent abundance of these is insufficient for direct killing of most skin pathogens. in this study, we sought to determine which molecules provide the majority of antimicrobial peptide activity in human sebocytes. acid-soluble protein extracts of seb-1 sebocytes were separated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and were assayed for their capacity to inhibit the growth of staphylococcus aureus. antimicrobial activity was isolated in a single major fraction and identified to be histone h4 by mass spectrometry and western blot analysis. the importance of histone h4 in the antimicrobial activity of sebocytes was confirmed by a specific neutralizing antibody and by direct demonstration that recombinant histone h4 had antimicrobial activity against s. aureus and propionibacterium acnes. in addition, histone h4 enhanced the antimicrobial action of free fatty acids in human sebum. taken together, these results indicate that the release of histone h4 by holocrine secretion from the sebaceous gland may play an important role in innate immunity.
cloning and expression of antibacterial goat lactoferricin from escherichia coli  ad494(de3)plyss expression system.
goat lactoferricin (glfcin), an antibacterial peptide, is released from the n terminus of goat lactoferrin by pepsin digestion. two glfcin-related cdnas, glfcin l and glfcin s, encoding ala20-ser60 and ser36-ser60 of goat lactoferrin, respectively, were cloned into the pet-23a(+) expression vector upstream from (his)6-tag gene and transformed into escherichia coli ad494(de3)plyss expression host. after being induced by isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside (iptg), two (his)6-tag fused recombinant lactoferricins, glfcin l-his*tag and glfcin s-his*tag, were expressed in soluble form within the e. coli cytoplasm. the glfcin l-his*tag and glfcin s-his*tag were purified using histrap affinity chromatography. according to an antibacterial activity assay using the agar diffusion method, glfcin l-his*tag had antibacterial activity against e. coli bcrc 11549, staphylococcus aureus bcrc 25923, and propionibacterium acnes bcrc 10723, while glfcin s-his*tag was able to inhibit the growth of e. coli bcrc 11549 and p. acnes bcrc 10723. these two recombinant lactoferricins behaved as thermostable peptides, which could retain their activity for up to 30 min of exposure at 100 degrees c.
in vitro anti-adhesive activity of green tea extract against pathogen adhesion.
camellia sinensis polysaccharide has been reported to possess anti-adhesive activity against pathogens. the present study was designed to investigate whether hot water extracts obtained from green tea leaves might inhibit pathogen adhesion to human or mouse cell lines. green tea extract-4 (csi-4) with the maximum yield of 4% (w/v) is composed of a major proportion of carbohydrates containing 40% uronic acids, but lack of catechins. it showed strong inhibitory activities against hemagglutination mediated by pathogens helicobacter pylori, propionibacterium acnes and staphylococcus aureus with the minimum inhibitory concentrations of 0.01-0.5 mg/ml. csi-4 further demonstrated an inhibitory effect on the adhesion of these pathogens to host cell lines with the ic(50) values (50% inhibition of adhesion) of 0.14-2.3 mg/ml. it exhibited the highest activity against p. acnes, but no inhibitory effects were observed against lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium bifidum, escherichia coli, or staphylococcus epidermidis. our results suggest that csi-4 may exert a selective anti-adhesive effect against certain pathogenic bacteria with no adverse effects against beneficial or commensal bacteria.
effect of bacteriocin produced by lactococcus sp. hy 449 on skin-inflammatory bacteria.
this study was carried out to evaluate the effect of bacteriocin produced by lactococcus sp. hy 449 against skin-inflammatory bacteria such as staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, staphylococcus aureus atcc 65389, streptococcus pyogenes atcc 21059, and propionibacterium acnes atcc 6919. the spot-on-the-lawn method was used to determine the antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin against indicator strains on the human skin. the bacteriocin produced by lactococcus sp. hy 449 inhibited the growth of s. epidermidis atcc 12228, s. aureus atcc 65389, strep. pyogenes atcc 21059, and p. acnes atcc 6919. the treatment of crude bacteriocin caused a rapid inactivation of p. acnes atcc 6919. the lc50 of bacteriocin on human fibroblast was ca. 50mg/ml at which the inhibition of cell proliferation was not observed. neither any irritations nor allergic reactions by the bacteriocin were evident in a human patch test. the bacteriocin produced by lactococcus sp. hy 449 may be a useful antimicrobial substance to control the growth of p. acnes and to prevent skin inflammation and acne.

antimicrobial activities of eucalyptus leaf extracts and flavonoids from eucalyptus maculata.
aims: we investigated the antimicrobial activities of eucalyptus leaf extracts to find effective antibacterial agents. methods and results: the antimicrobial activities of leaf extracts from 26 species of eucalyptus were measured. extracts of eucalyptus globulus, e. maculata and e. viminalis significantly inhibited the growth of six gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, mrsa, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris, propionibacterium acnes), and of a fungus (trichophyton mentagrophytes), but they did not show strong antibacterial activity against gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida). 2',6'-dihydroxy-3'-methyl-4'-methoxy-dihydrochalcone, eucalyptin and 8-desmethyl-eucalyptin, isolated from e. maculata extracts, exhibited potent antimicrobial activities against seven micro-organisms with minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) ranging from 1.0 to 31 mg l(-1). conclusions: the eucalyptus extracts and three compounds from e. maculata were found to be effective against micro-organisms that cause food poisoning, acne and athlete's foot. significance and impact of the study: this study shows potential uses of extracts from e. globulus, e. maculata and e. viminalis, and antimicrobial compounds isolated from e. maculata.
formation of propionibacterium acnes biofilms on orthopaedic biomaterials and their susceptibility to antimicrobials.
failure to treat and eradicate prosthetic hip infection with systemic antibiotic  regimens is usually due to the fact that the infection is associated with biofilm formation and that bacterial cells growing within a biofilm exhibit increased resistance to antimicrobial agents. in this in vitro study, we investigated the susceptibility of prosthetic hip propionibacterium acnes and staphylococcus spp. isolates growing within biofilms on polymethylmethacrylate (pmma) bone cement to a range of antibiotics. all p. acnes isolates in the biofilm mode of growth demonstrated considerably greater resistance to cefamandole, ciprofloxacin and vancomycin. in contrast, only four of the eight p. acnes isolates demonstrated an increase in resistance to gentamicin. all ten staphylococcus spp. isolates in the biofilm mode of growth exhibited large increases in resistance to gentamicin and cefamandole with eight of the ten isolates also exhibiting an increase in resistance to vancomycin. however, only three of the ten staphylococcus spp. isolates exhibited an increase in resistance to ciprofloxacin. biofilms were also formed on three different titanium alloys and on pmma bone cement using p. acnes, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus strains to determine if the underlying biomaterial surface had an effect on biofilm formation and the antimicrobial susceptibility of the bacteria growing within biofilms. although differences in the rate at which the three strains adhered to the different biomaterials were apparent, no differences in biofilm antibiotic resistance between the biomaterials were observed. in the light of these results, it is important that the efficacy of other antibiotics against p. acnes and staphylococcus spp. prosthetic hip isolates growing within biofilms on orthopaedic biomaterials be determined to ensure optimal treatment of orthopaedic implant infection.
pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis.
i retrospectively reviewed the records of 111 patients who had pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis unrelated to an open procedure on the spine. the mean age at the time of the diagnosis was sixty years (range, eighteen to eighty-four years); sixty-one patients (55 per cent) were sixty years old or more. forty-four patients (40 per cent) had an impaired immune system secondary to diabetes mellitus, the use of corticosteroids, chemotherapy for cancer, rheumatic or immunological disease, renal or hepatic failure, malnutrition, or myelodysplasia. magnetic resonance imaging, critical for the determination of an early diagnosis, was performed for 103 patients (93 per cent). the infection in sixty-eight patients (61 per cent) was diagnosed within one month after the onset of symptoms. the most frequent infecting organism was staphylococcus aureus (forty patients; 36 per cent). the infection in forty-one patients (37 per cent) was caused by organisms, such as staphylococcus epidermidis, propionibacterium acnes, and diphtheroid species, that are traditionally considered to be of low virulence. the urinary tract was the most frequent source of infection (confirmed in thirteen patients and suspected in twenty-one). the success of non-operative treatment was predicted by four independent variables: an age of less than sixty years, the immune status, infection with staphylococcus aureus, and a decreasing erythrocyte sedimentation rate. forty-two patients were managed with debridement and arthrodesis. fourteen of these patients also had instrumentation of the spine, in the presence of infection, without compromise of the outcome. eighteen patients died by the time of the latest follow-up evaluation at a mean of four years (range, two years and two months to six years and six months): seven who had been managed non-operatively died in the first month after the diagnosis was made, three died in the acute postoperative period, three died of late complications of paraplegia, and five died of unrelated causes. none of the eighty-nine patients who were seen at a minimum of two years postoperatively had had late recurrence of infection. chronic, severe back pain was noted in only seven patients.
evaluation of minocycline and cefuzonam for antimicrobial activity against clinical isolates.
the antibacterial activity of minocycline (mino) and that of cefuzonam (czon) were assessed with clinical isolates of 19 species, and compared with that of other antibiotics. mino was highly active against methicilli-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa), neisseria gonorrhoeae, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, helicobacter pylori, flavobacterium meningosepticum, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, peptostreptococcus spp. and propionibacterium acnes, but not as effective against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas cepacia and alcaligenes xylosoxidans. czon was highly active against mssa, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, n. gonorrhoeae, m(b). catarrhalis, h. influenzae, h. pylori, p. mirabilis, peptostreptococcus spp. and p. acnes, but not effective against mrsa. it was minimally active against gram-negative rods (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, etc.) and bacteria that do not ferment glucose.
[activation of the resident microbial flora as a possibility for the improvement  of humoral antibody potentials].
the effect of a parenteral application of an adjuvant (propionibacterium acnes) and an adjuvant/antigen combination (staphylococcus aureus cowan i/al(oh)3, pseudomonas aeruginosa/al(oh)3 respectively, was tested with regard to the improvement of antibacterial resistance. parameter was the humoral antibody production (igg) of rabbits against six facultative pathogen bacterial species (st. aureus, sc. faecium, bac. cereus, p. multocida, e. coli, ps. aeruginosa) and against sheep rod blood cell membranes. the three methods of treatment led to a significant enhancement of igg-antibodies against the particular homologous antigen. in addition to this specific reaction the application of adjuvant/antigen combinations provoked a significant enhancement of antibodies also against heterologous antigens (p. multocida, bac. cereus, sheep red blood cell membranes). the application of p. acnes had no distinct effect on the antibody titer against the different antigen preparations. in order to analyse the immune response qualitatively, a greater part of serum samples was examined by immuno blot technique. the number of partial antigens recognized by the sera increased during the experiments but the rise did generally not relate to developments of antibody titers. nevertheless, the ps. aeruginosa/al(oh)3-treatment seemed to improve the ability of sera to detect antigenic determinants of heterologous bacterial species.
studies on antibacterial agents. i. synthesis of substituted 6,7-dihydro-1-oxo-1h,5h-benzo[i,j]quinolizine-2-carboxylic acids.
a series of substituted 6,7-dihydro-1-oxo-1h,5h-benzo[i,j]quinolizine-2-carboxylic acids was synthesized and tested for antibacterial activities. among them, 9-fluoro-6,7-dihydro-5-methyl-8-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-1-oxo-1h,5h- benzo[i,j]quinolizine-2-carboxylic acid (opc-7241) exhibited potent antibacterial activity against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 9-fluoro-6,7-dihydro-8-(4-hydroxy-1-piperidyl)-5-methyl-1-oxo-1h, 5h-benzo[i,j]quinolizine-2-carboxylic acid (opc-7251) showed potent activity characteristically against propionibacterium acnes.
teichomycin: in-vitro and in-vivo evaluation in comparison with other antibiotics.
teichomycin, a new glycopeptide antibiotic with a spectrum of activity similar to that of vancomycin, was highly active against staphylococci, streptococci and gram-positive anaerobes (propionibacterium acnes, clostridium perfringens and cl. difficile). ninety per cent of the staphylococcus aureus and streptococcal strains, including enterococci, were inhibited by 0.4 mg/l; 90% of staph. epidermidis strains were susceptible to 1.6 mg/l. vancomycin was less active than teichomycin against all clinical isolates tested. multiply resistant strains, including methicillin-resistant staph. aureus, were all susceptible to teichomycin and vancomycin. teichomycin was highly bactericidal for growing cells of staphylococci and streptococcus pyogenes and moderately bactericidal for str. faecalis. in mice, teichomycin was well absorbed upon subcutaneous administration and had a half-life of 2.5 h. it was very effective in curing experimental mouse septicemias caused by gram-positive bacteria (ed50 values less than 1 mg/kg).
production, purification, and properties of a bacteriocin from staphylococcus aureus isolated from saliva.
staphylococci from samples of human saliva were isolated on staphylococcal-selective agar plates. these strains were tested for the inhibition of the growth of staphylococcus aureus fda209p. the frequency of inhibitory strains among all of the staphylococcal isolates was 5.2%. strain iys2, which formed the biggest inhibitory zone against the growth of the indicator strain, was used as the producer of bacteriocin. iys2 was identified to be s. aureus, based on its biological properties. the bacteriocin was purified by sequential procedures, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, fractionation with ethanol, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. its molecular weight was determined to be 5,000. the isoelectric point was 10.0. in amino acid composition, lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, valine, and phenylalanine were predominant. the bacteriocin was heat stable but inactivated by proteases or peptidase. the bacteriocin had a bactericidal effect on susceptible cells. an analysis of the inhibitory spectrum among typical oral indigenous bacteria showed that streptococcus salivarius, propionibacterium acnes, corynebacterium parvulum, and actinomyces israelii were susceptible to the bacteriocin. streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacterionema matruchotii, and bacteroides melaninogenicus were resistant. the majority of s. aureus tested were susceptible, and all staphylococcus epidermidis strains tested were resistant.
bacterial colonization in intubated newborns.
the bacteriology of tracheal aspirates from 127 newborns was studied. specimens were obtained twice a week as long as the newborns were intubated. each newborn had between one and eight specimens taken (average 1.7). 127 babies had one specimen taken, 38 had two, 25 had three, 12 had four, and 10 had more than four specimens taken, which made a total of 212 specimens. no bacterial or fungal growth was obtained from 65 specimens, whereas the remaining specimens (147) yielded 209 bacterial and fungal isolates accounting for 1.4 isolates per specimen. the total isolates recovered were 168 aerobes, 36 anaerobes, and 5 candida albicans. of this total, 70 specimens yielded one isolate, 48 two isolates, 6 three isolates, 5 four isolates, and one aspirate yielded five isolates. 78 newborns (61%) received antimicrobial therapy. a higher incidence of positive cultures and the presence of more than one organism per culture were found in those infants not receiving antibiotics. more isolates per specimen were noted with increasing time of incubation. the rate of isolation staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae remained constant with increased length of intubation, the rate of recovery of staphylococcus epidermidis, viridans group streptococci, and propionibacterium acnes increased, and the rate of isolation of escherichia coli and anaerobic organisms decreased.
