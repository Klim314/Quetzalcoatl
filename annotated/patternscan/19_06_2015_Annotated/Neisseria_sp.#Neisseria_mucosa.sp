TI  == oral microbiota shift after 12-week supplementation with lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289; a randomized control trial.
AB  == background: lactobacillus spp. potentially contribute to health by modulating bacterial biofilm formation, but their effects on the overall oral microbiota remain unclear. methods and findings: oral microbiota was characterized via 454-pyrosequencing of the 16s rdna hypervariable region v3-v4 after 12 weeks of daily lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289 consumption. forty-four adults were assigned to a test group (n = 22) that received lactobacilli lozenges (108 cfu of each strain/lozenge) or a control group that received placebo (n = 22). presence of l. reuteri was confirmed by cultivation and species specific pcr. tooth biofilm samples from 16 adults before, during, and after exposure were analyzed by pyrosequencing. a total of 1,310,292 sequences were quality filtered. after removing single reads, 257 species or phylotypes were identified at 98.5% identity in the human oral microbiome database. firmicutes, bacteroidetes, fusobacteria, proteobacteria, and actinobacteria were the most abundant phyla. streptococcus was the most common genus and the s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group comprised the dominant species. the number of observed species was unaffected by l. reuteri exposure. however, subjects who had consumed l. reuteri were clustered in a principal coordinates analysis relative to scattering at baseline, and multivariate modeling of pyrosequencing microbiota, and culture and pcr detected l. reuteri separated baseline from 12-week samples in test subjects. l. reuteri intake correlated with increased s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group and campylobacter concisus, granulicatella adiacens, bergeyella sp. hot322, neisseria subflava, and sr1 [g-1] sp. hot874 detection and reduced s. mutans, s. anginosus, n. mucosa, fusobacterium periodicum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii, and prevotella maculosa detection. this effect had disappeared 1 month after exposure was terminated. conclusions: l. reuteri consumption did not affect species richness but induced a shift in the oral microbiota composition. the biological relevance of this remains to be elucidated. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct02311218.

TI  == alcohol and tobacco consumption affects bacterial richness in oral cavity mucosa  biofilms.
AB  == background: today there are more than 2 billion alcohol users and about 1.3 billion tobacco users worldwide. the chronic and heavy use of these two substances is at the heart of numerous diseases and may wreak havoc on the human  oral microbiome. this study delves into the changes that alcohol and tobacco may  cause on biofilms of the human oral microbiome. to do so, we used swabs to sample the oral biofilm of 22 subjects; including 9 control-individuals with no or very  low consumption of alcohol and no consumption of tobacco, 7 who were chronic and  heavy users of both substances and 6 active smokers that reported no significant  alcohol consumption. dna was extracted from swabs and the v1 region of the 16s rrna gene was pcr amplified and sequenced using the ion torrent pgm platform, generating 3.7 million high quality reads. dna sequences were clustered and otus  were assigned using the arb silva database and qiime. results: we found no differences in species diversity and evenness among the groups. however, we found a significant decrease in species richness in only smokers and in smokers/drinkers when compared to controls. we found that neisseria abundance was significantly decreased in both groups when compared to controls. smokers had significant increases in prevotella and capnocytophaga and reductions in granulicatella, staphylococcus, peptostreptococcus and gemella when compared to the two other groups. controls showed higher abundance of aggregibacter, whilst smokers/drinkers had lower abundances of fusobacteria. samples from only smokers  clustered closer together than to controls and smokers/drinkers, and also had a significant reduction in inter-group dissimilarity distances, indicating a more homogenous group than controls. conclusions: our results indicate that the continued use of tobacco or alcohol plus tobacco significantly reduces bacterial  richness, which apparently leads to a reduction in inter-group variability, turning the respective biofilms into a more homogenous microenvironment in terms  of bacterial community composition, with possible consequences for human oral diseases.

TI  == the cultivable human oral gluten-degrading microbiome and its potential implications in coeliac disease and gluten sensitivity.
AB  == coeliac disease is characterized by intestinal inflammation caused by gluten, proteins which are widely contained in the western diet. mammalian digestive enzymes are only partly capable of cleaving gluten, and fragments remain that induce toxic responses in patients with coeliac disease. we found that the oral microbiome is a novel and rich source of gluten-degrading organisms. here we report on the isolation and characterization of the cultivable resident oral microbes that are capable of cleaving gluten, with special emphasis on the immunogenic domains. bacteria were obtained by a selective culturing approach and enzyme activities were characterized by: (i) hydrolysis of paranitroanilide-derivatized gliadin-derived tripeptide substrates; (ii) gliadin  degradation in-gel (gliadin zymography); (iii) gliadin degradation in solution; (iv) proteolysis of the highly immunogenic alpha-gliadin-derived 33-mer peptide.  for selected strains ph activity profiles were determined. the culturing strategy yielded 87 aerobic and 63 anaerobic strains. species with activity in at least two of the four assays were typed as: rothia mucilaginosa hot-681, rothia aeria hot-188, actinomyces odontolyticus hot-701, streptococcus mitis hot-677, streptococcus sp. hot-071, neisseria mucosa hot-682 and capnocytophaga sputigena  hot-775, with rothia species being active in all four assays. cleavage specificities and substrate preferences differed among the strains identified. the approximate molecular weights of the enzymes were ~75 kd (rothia spp.), ~60 kd (a. odontolyticus) and ~150 kd (streptococcus spp.). in conclusion, this study identified new gluten-degrading microorganisms in the upper gastrointestinal tract. a cocktail of the most active oral bacteria, or their isolated enzymes, may offer promising new treatment modalities for coeliac disease.

TI  == microbiota of deciduous endodontic infections analysed by mda and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the microbiota of endodontic infections in deciduous teeth by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization after uniform amplification of dna in samples  by multiple displacement amplification (mda). methodology: forty samples from the root canal system of deciduous teeth exhibiting pulp necrosis with or without radiographically detectable periradicular/interradicular bone resorption were collected and 32 were analysed, with three individuals contributing two samples;  these were mda-amplified and analysed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization for levels of 83 bacterial taxa. two outcome measures were used: the percentage of teeth colonized by each species and the mean proportion of each bacterial taxon present across all samples. results: the mean amount of dna in the samples prior  to amplification was 5.2 (+/-4.7) ng and 6.1 (+/-2.3) mug after mda. the mean number of species detected per sample was 19 (+/-4) (range: 3-66) to the nearest  whole number. the most prevalent taxa were prevotella intermedia (96.9%), neisseria mucosa (65.6%), prevotella nigrescens (56.2%) and tannerella forsythia  (56.2%). aggregatibacter (haemophilus) aphrophilus and helicobacter pylori were not detected. p. intermedia (10%), prevotella tannerae (7%) and prevotella nigrescens (4.3%) presented the highest mean proportions of the target species averaged across the positive samples. conclusion: root canals of infected deciduous teeth had a diverse bacterial population. prevotella sp. were commonly  found with p. intermedia, prevotella tannerae and prevotella nigrescens amongst the most prominent species detected.

TI  == [characteristics of microflora of laryngeal mucosa in healthy subjects and patients with cicatrical stenosis of the larynx].
AB  == the authors present data on the occurrence, density, and species composition of microorganisms isolated from pharyngeal mucosa of 40 healthy subjects and 55 patients with cicatrical stenosis of the larynx. the total density of microbial populations in control subjects was estimated at 2,672+/-614 cfu/ml compared with 17,510+/-1,983 cfu/ml in patients with cicatrical stenosis of the larynx unrelated to malignant neoplastic growth and 19,375+/-2,103 cfu/ml in patients who had experienced surgical intervention for the treatment of malignancy. a total of 312 microbial strains were isolated and identified. coccal bacteria were the predominant group (streptococci-74 strains, neisseria-72, staphylococci-62, micrococci-12). collectively, they comprised 70.5% of all isolated strains representing autochthonous microflora. corynebacteria, moraxellas, and enterobacteria (transitory forms) were rare. the occurrence of neisseria, staphylococci and fungi (genus candida) in patients with cicatrical stenosis of the larynx was significantly higher than in the healthy subjects. moreover, the patients developed dysbacteriosis with the predominance of n. flavescens, s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. alpha-haemoliticus, and candida sp. it is concluded that elucidation of the microbial landscape in patients with cicatrical stenosis  of the larynx is of importance for planning prevention and management of pyoseptic complications in the course of surgical treatment.

TI  == [changes in oral microflora in patients with recurrent oral ulcers].
AB  == objective: to investigate the correlation between the changes in oral microflora  and recurrent oral ulcers (rou). methods: salivary sample were collected from rou patients with oral ulcers (group t) and those with ulcer healing (group c) as well as from rou-free individuals (group n). the quantity of 3 common bacteria (streptococcus sp., veillonella sp., and neisseria sp.) in the salivary samples was detected and compared between the 3 groups. results: the quantities of streptococcus sp. (7.30-/+0.89 copies/ml) and veillonella sp. (8.29-/+0.77 copies/ml) in group t were significantly lower than those in group n (8.15-/+0.55 and 8.93-/+0.76 copies/ml, respectively, p<0.01), but similar with those in group c. the quantity of streptococcus sp. (7.51-/+0.81 copies/ml) in group c was significantly lower than that in group n (8.15-/+0.55 copies/ml, p<0.01), but the quantity of veillonella sp. was similar between the two groups. no significant difference were found in the quantity of neisseria sp. between the 3 groups. conclusion: the quantity of oral microflora differs significantly between patients with recurrent oral ulcers and normal individuals, suggesting a possible correlation between oral microfora and recurrent oral ulcers.

TI  == microbiological findings in subjects with asymptomatic oral lichen planus: a cross-sectional comparative study.
AB  == background: the bacterial colonization of the oral mucosa was evaluated in patients with asymptomatic oral lichen planus (olp) and compared to the microbiologic status in mucosally healthy subjects. methods: bacteria from patients with clinically and histopathologically diagnosed olp from the stomatology service, department of oral surgery and stomatology, school of dental medicine, university of bern, were collected with a non-invasive swab system. samples were taken from olp lesions on the gingiva and from non-affected sites on the contralateral side of the mouth. the control population did not have olp and  was recruited from the student clinic. all samples were processed with the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method using well-defined bacterial species for the analysis. results: significantly higher bacterial counts of bacteroides ureolyticus (p = 0.001), dialister species (sp.) (p = 0.006), staphylococcus haemolyticus (p = 0.007), and streptococcus agalactiae (p = 0.006) were found in  samples taken from olp lesions compared to sites with no clinical evidence of olp. significantly higher bacterial counts were found for capnocytophaga sputigena, eikenella corrodens, lactobacillus crispatus, mobiluncus curtisii, neisseria mucosa, prevotella bivia, prevotella intermedia, and s. agalactiae at sites with lesions in subjects with olp compared to sites in control subjects (p  <0.001). conclusions: microbiologic differences were found between sites with olp and sites in subjects without a diagnosis of olp. specifically, higher counts of  staphylococci and s. agalactiae were found in olp lesions.

TI  == microbiological evaluation of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without sinus tract.
AB  == aim: to examine the microbiological status of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without a sinus tract. methodology: samples were collected by means of a size 15 h-type file and two sterile paper points from 30 cases of primary endodontic infections with (n = 15) or without (n = 15) a sinus tract. the presence of 40 bacterial species was determined by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. results: the species found at the highest levels and prevalence were fusobacterium nucleatum sp. vincentii, porphyromonas gingivalis,  veillonella parvula, enterococcus faecalis, campylobacter gracilis and neisseria  mucosa. total bacterial counts were similar between teeth with (44 x 10(5)) and without (50 x 10(5)) a sinus tract (t-test: p > 0.05). e. faecalis, streptococcus anginosus, capnocytophaga sputigena and capnocytophaga gingivalis had significantly higher counts in the absence of sinus tract (mann-whitney test, p < 0.05). higher levels of p. gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum were observed in cases with a sinus tract. leptotrichia buccalis (or = 1.83; ci 95%) and porphyromonas endodontalis (or = 2.15; ci 95%) were associated with an increased chance of subjects having a sinus tract. conclusions: primary endodontic infections were associated with a large variety of bacterial species.  specific differences between the composition of the microbiota of primary root canal infections were observed in cases with or without a sinus tract.

TI  == a pneumococcal merr-like regulator and s-nitrosoglutathione reductase are required for systemic virulence.
AB  == a transcriptional regulator, nmlr(sp), has been identified in streptococcus pneumoniae that is required for defense against nitric oxide (no) stress. the nmlr(sp) gene is cotranscribed with adhc, which encodes an alcohol dehydrogenase  that is able to reduce s-nitrosoglutathione (gsno) with nadh as reductant. nmlr(sp) and adhc mutants exhibited a reduced level of nadh-gsno oxidoreductase activity and were more susceptible to killing by no than were wild-type cells. comparison of the virulence of wild-type and mutant strains by use of a mouse model system showed that nmlr(sp) and adhc do not play a key role in the adherence of pneumococci to the nasopharynx in vivo. an intraperitoneal challenge experiment revealed that both nmlr(sp) and adhc were required for survival in blood. these data identify novel components of a no defense system in pneumococci that are required for systemic infection.

TI  == infection at titanium implants with or without a clinical diagnosis of inflammation.
AB  == objectives: to assess the microbiota at implants diagnosed with peri-implantitis, implant mucositis, or being clinically healthy. material and methods: clinical and microbiological data were collected from 213 subjects (mean age: 65.7+/-14) with 976 implants in function (mean: 10.8 years, sd+/-1.5). forty species were identified by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. results: implant mean % plaque score was 41.8+/-32.4%. periodontitis defined by bone loss was found in 44.9% of subjects. implant mucositis was diagnosed in 59% and peri-implantitis in 14.9% of all cases. neisseria mucosa, fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum, f. nucleatum sp. polymorphum, and capnocytophaga sputigena dominated the implant sub-mucosal microbiota and the sub-gingival microbiota at tooth sites. implant probing pocket depth at the implant site with the deepest probing depth was correlated with levels of eikenella corrodens (r=0.16, p<0.05), the levels of f. nucleatum sp. vincentii (r=0.15, p<0.05), porphyromonas gingivalis (r=0.14, p<0.05), and micromonas micros (r=0.17, p=0.01). e. corrodens was found in higher levels at implants with mucositis compared with implant health (p<0.05). subjects who lost teeth due to periodontitis had higher yields of f. nucleatum sp. vincentii (p<0.02) and n. mucosa (p<0.05). independent of implant status subjects with teeth had higher levels of p. gingivalis (p<0.05), and leptotrichia buccalis (p<0.05). conclusions: at implant sites studied, few bacteria differed by whether subjects were dentate or not or by implant status.

TI  == the integration site of the iga gene in commensal neisseria sp.
AB  == an iga1 protease is produced by the human pathogens neisseria gonorrhoeae and n.  meningitidis but not by related non-pathogenic, commensal, neisseria species. in  this study, the chromosomal iga locus was characterized in the n. gonorrhoeae strain ms11 and compared to corresponding loci in n. meningitidis and commensal neisseria species. in n. gonorrhoeae, the genes trpb and ksga were found immediately downstream of iga. in addition to coml and coma, a homolog of the escherichia coli yfii gene was identified upstream of iga. each gene in the iga region (yfii and coml, coma and iga, and trpb and ksga) is transcribed in the opposite direction to its neighbors. the coml/ coma and iga/ trpb pairs each have a transcriptional terminator in the correct position for joint use. these terminators contain the common gonococcal dna uptake sequence (dus). a highly conserved direct repeat of 25 bp located immediately adjacent to the iga gene in  n. gonorrhoeae was also found in n. meningitidis. in southern hybridization experiments, no homology to iga was detectable in the chromosomal dnas of the commensal species n. mucosa, n. lactamica, n. flavescens, n. cinerea, n. subflava, n. flava, n. sicca or n. elongata. when n. gonorrhoeae coml and trpb were used as probes, signals were detected on the same restriction fragment in six of the eight species. this indicated that commensal neisseria species share a possible integration site for the iga gene between coma and trpb. the region between coma and trpb was therefore amplified by pcr. the fragment obtained from  n. lactamica showed a high degree of homology to gonococcal coma and trpb, respectively, but iga was replaced by a sequence of 13 bp that shows no homology  to any known gonococcal sequence. our data suggest that iga was acquired by a common ancestor of n. gonorrhoeae and n. meningitidis rather than being distributed by horizontal gene transfer. n. lactamica, which is more closely related to n. gonorrhoeae than other commensals, may have lost iga by deletion.

TI  == focal vulvitis: a characteristic syndrome and cause of dyspareunia. features, natural history, and management.
AB  == based on the study of 67 affected women during a period of 15 years, we report the clinical features and natural history of focal vulvitis, a unique syndrome characterized by severe and persistent superficial dyspareunia and the presence of one to 11 (median three) minute, exquisitely tender areas of focal inflammation or ulceration on the mucosa of the vestibule. three fourths of all lesions occur around the bartholin gland ducts or between them posteriorly. histopathologic study of tissues from seven patients has not shown a characteristic pattern of inflammation and fails to confirm a reported association between these lesions and the minor vestibular glands. these histologic studies and an in-depth clinical and epidemiologic investigation in nine patients, including microbiologic studies to identify infection by herpes simplex virus. neisseria gonorrhoeae, staphylococcus aureus, beta-hemolytic streptococci, chlamydia trachomatis, mycoplasmas, candida sp., trichomonads, or mycobacterium sp., have not established an infectious etiology for this syndrome  or evidence that it represents an unusual form of an autoimmune disease or behcet's syndrome. treatment with topical antimicrobial or corticosteroid creams, antibiotics given systemically, or cryotherapy has not been of demonstrable benefit. approximately one half of patients eventually experience spontaneous remission but many appear to remain symptomatic indefinitely. surgical excision of the hymenal ring and contiguous mucosa of the vestibule has brought relief and permitted resumption of sexual activity in seven of eight treated patients. while promising, operation should be reserved for patients who have experienced unremitting dyspareunia associated with the characteristic focal inflammatory lesions for at least 6 months.

TI  == aerobic bacterial flora of oral and nasal fluids of canines with reference to bacteria associated with bites.
AB  == oral and nasal fluids of 50 dogs were examined to determine the prevalence of aerobic bacteria frequently associated with animal bite wounds. the most frequently isolated microorganisms included: iij, ef-4, pasteurella multocida, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, group d streptococci, corynebacterium sp., enterobacteria, neisseria sp., moraxella sp., and bacillus sp. other species and genera were infrequently recovered and may represent transient flora. the high incidence of iij, ef-4, p. multocida, and s. aureus, all known human pathogens, suggests that they should be considered as probably contaminants in bite wounds.
