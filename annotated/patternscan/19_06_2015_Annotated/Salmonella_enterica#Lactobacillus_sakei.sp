TI  == the cyclic antibacterial peptide enterocin as-48: isolation, mode of action, and  possible food applications.
AB  == enterocin as-48 is a circular bacteriocin produced by enterococcus. it contains a 70 amino acid-residue chain circularized by a head-to-tail peptide bond. the conformation of enterocin as-48 is arranged into five alpha-helices with a compact globular structure. enterocin as-48 has a wide inhibitory spectrum on gram-positive bacteria. sensitivity of gram-negative bacteria increases in combination with outer-membrane permeabilizing treatments. eukaryotic cells are bacteriocin-resistant. this cationic peptide inserts into bacterial membranes and causes membrane permeabilization, leading ultimately to cell death. microarray analysis revealed sets of up-regulated and down-regulated genes in bacillus cereus cells treated with sublethal bacteriocin concentration. enterocin as-48 can be purified in two steps or prepared as lyophilized powder from cultures in whey-based substrates. the potential applications of enterocin as-48 as a food biopreservative have been corroborated against foodborne pathogens and/or toxigenic bacteria (listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica) and spoilage bacteria (alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris, bacillus spp., paenibacillus spp., geobacillus stearothermophilus, brochothrix thermosphacta, staphylococcus carnosus, lactobacillus sakei and other spoilage lactic acid bacteria). the efficacy of enterocin as-48 in food systems increases greatly in combination with chemical preservatives, essential oils, phenolic compounds, and physico-chemical treatments such as sublethal heat, high-intensity pulsed-electric fields or high  hydrostatic pressure.

TI  == quantification and efficiency of lactobacillus sakei strain mixtures used as protective cultures in ground beef.
AB  == lactobacillus sakei is a lactic acid bacterium, naturally associated with long term storage of fresh meat at low temperature. here we investigated the effect, on the evolution of pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms in ground beef, of l.  sakei cocktails used as bioprotective cultures. we selectively developed a real time quantitative pcr method, allowing the quantification of individual l. sakei  strains inoculated in ground meat with specific probes. six cocktails of three strains were tested to evaluate their effect on the growth of salmonella enterica typhimurium, escherichia coli o157:h7 and brochothrix thermosphacta at 4 degrees  c and 8 degrees c, under vacuum or modified atmosphere packaging. using plating methods to quantify the different bacterial species, one cocktail showed an effect against s. typhimurium and e. coli under given conditions. real time quantitative pcr showed that the three inoculated l. sakei strains had a different growth pattern, and that the association of these three strains indeed  impaired growth of s. typhimurium and e. coli.

TI  == bile stress response in listeria monocytogenes lo28: adaptation, cross-protection, and identification of genetic loci involved in bile resistance.
AB  == bile is one of many barriers that listeria monocytogenes must overcome in the human gastrointestinal tract in order to infect and cause disease. we demonstrated that stationary-phase cultures of l. monocytogenes lo28 were able to tolerate concentrations of bovine, porcine, and human bile and bile acids well in excess of those encountered in vivo. strain lo28 was relatively bile resistant compared with other clinical isolates of l. monocytogenes, as well as with listeria innocua, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium lt2, and lactobacillus  sakei. while exponential-phase l. monocytogenes lo28 cells were exquisitely sensitive to unconjugated bile acids, prior adaptation to sublethal levels of bile acids or heterologous stresses, such as acid, heat, salt, or sodium dodecyl  sulfate (sds), significantly enhanced bile resistance. this adaptive response was independent of protein synthesis, and in the cases of bile and sds adaptation, occurred in seconds. in order to identify genetic loci involved in the bile tolerance phenotype of l. monocytogenes lo28, transposon (tn917) and plasmid (pori19) integration banks were screened for bile-sensitive mutants. the disrupted genes included a homologue of the capa locus required for capsule formation in bacillus anthracis; a gene encoding the transcriptional regulator zurr; a homologue of an escherichia coli gene, lytb, involved in isoprenoid biosynthesis; a gene encoding a homologue of the bacillus subtilis membrane protein yxio; and a gene encoding an amino acid transporter with a putative role  in ph homeostasis, gade. interestingly, all of the identified loci play putative  roles in maintenance of the cell envelope or in stress responses.
