TI  == susceptibility to campylobacter infection is associated with the species composition of the human fecal microbiota.
AB  == the gut microbiota is essential for human health, but very little is known about  how the composition of this ecosystem can influence and respond to bacterial infections. here we address this by prospectively studying the gut microbiota composition before, during, and after natural campylobacter infection in exposed  poultry abattoir workers. the gut microbiota composition was analyzed with 16s amplicon sequencing of fecal samples from poultry abattoir workers during the peak season of campylobacter infection in sweden. the gut microbiota compositions were compared between individuals who became culture positive for campylobacter and those who remained negative. individuals who became campylobacter positive had a significantly higher abundance of bacteroides (p = 0.007) and escherichia (p = 0.002) species than those who remained culture negative. furthermore, this group had a significantly higher abundance of phascolarctobacterium (p = 0.017) and streptococcus (p = 0.034) sequences than the campylobacter-negative group, which had an overrepresentation of clostridiales (p = 0.017), unclassified lachnospiraceae (p = 0.008), and anaerovorax (p = 0.015) sequences. intraindividual comparisons of the fecal microbiota compositions yielded small differences over time in campylobacter-negative participants, but significant long-term changes were found in the campylobacter-positive group (p < 0.005). the results suggest that the abundance of specific genera in the microbiota reduces resistance to campylobacter colonization in humans and that campylobacter infection can have long-term effects on the composition of the human fecal microbiota. importance: studies using mouse models have made important contributions to our understanding of the role of the gut microbiota in resistance to bacterial enteropathogen colonization. the relative abundances of escherichia coli and bacteroides species have been pointed out as important determinants of susceptibility to gram-negative pathogens in general and campylobacter infection in particular. in this study, we assessed the role of the human gut microbiota in resistance to campylobacter colonization by studying abattoir workers that are heavily exposed to these bacteria. individuals with a certain composition of the gut microbiota became culture positive for campylobacter. as their microbiotas were characterized by high abundances of bacteroides spp. and e. coli, well in line with the findings with mouse models, these bacterial species likely play an important role in colonization resistance  also in humans.

TI  == sewage reflects the distribution of human faecal lachnospiraceae.
AB  == faecal pollution contains a rich and diverse community of bacteria derived from animals and humans, many of which might serve as alternatives to the traditional  enterococci and escherichia coli faecal indicators. we used massively parallel sequencing (mps) of the 16s rrna gene to characterize microbial communities from  wastewater treatment plant (wwtp) influent sewage from 12 cities geographically distributed across the usa. we examined members of the clostridiales, which included the families clostridiaceae, lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae for their potential as sewage indicators. lachnospiraceae was one of the most abundant groups of faecal bacteria in sewage, and several lachnospiraceae high-abundance sewage pyrotags occurred in at least 46 of 48 human faecal samples. clone libraries targeting clostridium coccoides (c. coccoides) in sewage samples demonstrated that lachnospiraceae-annotated v6 pyrotags encompassed the previously reported c. coccoides group. we used oligotyping to profile the genus  blautia within lachnospiraceae and found oligotypes comprised of 24 entropy components that showed patterns of host specificity. these findings suggest that  indicators based on blautia might have the capacity to discriminate between different faecal pollution sources. development of source-specific alternative indicators would enhance water quality assessments, which leads to improved ecosystem health and reduced human health risk due to waterborne disease.

TI  == identification and characterization of potential performance-related gut microbiotas in broiler chickens across various feeding trials.
AB  == three broiler feeding trials were investigated in order to identify gut bacteria  consistently linked with improvements in bird performance as measured by feed efficiency. trials were done in various geographic locations and varied in diet composition, broiler breed, and bird age. gut microbial communities were investigated using microbial profiling. eight common performance-linked operational taxonomic units (otus) were identified within both the ilea (180, 492, and 564-566) and ceca (140-142, 218-220, 284-286, 312, and 482) across trials. otu 564-566 was associated with lower performance, while otus 140-142, 482, and 492 were associated with improved performance. targeted cloning and sequencing of these eight otus revealed that they represented 26 bacterial species or phylotypes which clustered phylogenetically into seven groups related  to lactobacillus spp., ruminococcaceae, clostridiales, gammaproteobacteria, bacteroidales, clostridiales/lachnospiraceae, and unclassified bacteria/clostridia. where bacteria were identifiable to the phylum level, they belonged predominantly to the firmicutes, with bacteroidetes and proteobacteria also identified. some of the potential performance-related phylotypes showed high sequence identity with classified bacteria (lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus aviarius, lactobacillus crispatus, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, escherichia coli, gallibacterium anatis, clostridium lactatifermentans, ruminococcus torques, bacteroides vulgatus, and alistipes finegoldii). the 16s rrna gene sequence information generated will allow quantitative assays to be developed which will enable elucidations of which of these phylotypes are truly performance related. this information could be used to monitor strategies to improve feed efficiency and feed formulation for optimal gut health.

TI  == crystal structure and putative mechanism of 3-methylitaconate-delta-isomerase from eubacterium barkeri.
AB  == 3-methylitaconate-delta-isomerase (mii) participates in the nicotinate fermentation pathway of the anaerobic soil bacterium eubacterium barkeri (order clostridiales) by catalyzing the reversible conversion of (r)-3-methylitaconate (2-methylene-3-methylsuccinate) to 2,3-dimethylmaleate. the enzyme is also able to catalyze the isomerization of itaconate (methylenesuccinate) to citraconate (methylmaleate) with ca 10-fold higher k(m) but > 1000-fold lower k(cat). the gene mii from e. barkeri was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. the protein produced with a c-terminal strep-tag exhibited the same specific activity as the wild-type enzyme. the crystal structure of mii from e. barkeri has been solved at a resolution of 2.70 a. the asymmetric unit of the p2(1)2(1)2(1) unit cell with parameters a = 53.1 a, b = 142.3 a, and c = 228.4 a contains four molecules of mii. the enzyme belongs to a group of isomerases with a common structural feature, the so-called diaminopimelate epimerase fold. the monomer of  380 amino acid residues has two topologically similar domains exhibiting an alpha/beta-fold. the active site is situated in a cleft between these domains. the four mii molecules are arranged as a tetramer with 222 symmetry for the n-terminal domains. the c-terminal domains have different relative positions with respect to the n-terminal domains resulting in a closed conformation for molecule a and two distinct open conformations for molecules b and d. the c-terminal domain of molecule c is disordered. the mii active site contains the putative catalytic residues lys62 and cys96, for which mechanistic roles are proposed based on a docking experiment of the mii substrate complex. the active sites of mii and the closely related prpf, most likely a methylaconitate delta-isomerase,  have been compared. the overall architecture including the active-site lys62, cys96, his300, and ser17 (mii numbering) is similar. this positioning of (r)-3-methylitaconate allows cys96 (as thiolate) to deprotonate c-3 and (as thiol) to donate a proton to the methylene carbon atom of the resulting allylic carbanion. interestingly, the active site of isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase type i also contains a cysteine that cooperates with glutamate rather than lysine. it has been proposed that the initial step in this enzyme is a protonation generating a tertiary carbocation intermediate.

TI  == effect of dietary protein level on growth performance, indicators of enteric health, and gastrointestinal microbial ecology of weaned pigs induced with postweaning colibacillosis.
AB  == the effect of dietary cp level on performance, enteric health, and gastrointestinal microbial ecology of weaned pigs challenged with enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) k88 was investigated in a 14-d study. forty weaned pigs (bw = 5.32 +/- 0.24 kg, mean +/- sd), housed 4 per pen, were randomly assigned to 2 diets (5 pens/diet): 1) 22.5% cp or 2) 17.6% cp supplemented with aa. diets contained the same amount of me and standardized ileal digestible lys, met + cys, thr, and trp based on the ideal protein ratio. isoleucine and val were added to the 17.6% cp diet up to the level in the 22.5% cp diet. on d 8 postweaning, pigs  were challenged with 6 ml of etec suspension (10(10) cfu/ml) by gavage. feed disappearance and bw were measured on d 7, 9, 10, 12, and 14 for determination of adg, adfi, and g:f. one pig from each pen was serially slaughtered on -1, 3, and  7 d postchallenge (10 pigs/d of slaughter) to evaluate gut morphology, and gut microbial ecology and metabolites. pigs fed the 22.5% cp diet had greater (p < 0.05) adg and g:f than those fed the 17.6% cp diet before infection, but performance was similar between the 2 diets after etec challenge and overall. on  d 3 after challenge, etec was not detected in the ileal digesta of pigs fed the 17.6% cp diet but was detected in the ileal digesta of 80% of pigs fed the 22.5%  cp diet (5.22 +/- 1.07 cfu/g, mean +/- sd). pigs fed the 17.6% cp diet had a greater (p < 0.01) prevalence of order clostridiales (73 vs. 50%), family lachnospiraceae (43 vs. 18%), and genus roseburia (13 vs. 3%) in the colon digesta 7 d after challenge compared with those fed the 22.5% cp diet. the richness and diversity of bacteria in the colon digesta were less (p < 0.05) in pigs fed the 17.6% cp diet than in those fed the 22.5% cp diet at -1, 3, and 7 d  postchallenge. pigs fed the 22.5% cp diet had greater (p < 0.05) ammonia n concentration in the colon digesta on -1 and 7 d after challenge compared with those fed the 17.6% cp diet. pigs fed the 22.5% cp diet had deeper (p < 0.05) crypts 1 d before challenge, shorter villi 3 d after challenge, and reduced villus height:crypt depth 1 d before and 3 d after challenge compared with those  fed the 17.6% cp diet. in conclusion, a reduction in the dietary cp level of weaned pigs from 22.5 to 17.6% with aa supplementation impaired growth performance before, but not after, the etec challenge and increased the relative  composition of butyrate producing bacteria in the colon digesta after etec challenge.

TI  == culture independent analysis of ileal mucosa reveals a selective increase in invasive escherichia coli of novel phylogeny relative to depletion of clostridiales in crohn's disease involving the ileum.
AB  == intestinal bacteria are implicated increasingly as a pivotal factor in the development of crohn's disease, but the specific components of the complex polymicrobial enteric environment driving the inflammatory response are unresolved. this study addresses the role of the ileal mucosa-associated microflora in crohn's disease. a combination of culture-independent analysis of bacterial diversity (16s rdna library analysis, quantitative pcr and fluorescence in situ hybridization) and molecular characterization of cultured bacteria was used to examine the ileal mucosa-associated flora of patients with crohn's disease involving the ileum (13), crohn's disease restricted to the colon (ccd) (8) and healthy individuals (7). analysis of 16s rdna libraries constructed from  ileal mucosa yielded nine clades that segregated according to their origin (p<0.0001). 16s rdna libraries of ileitis mucosa were enriched in sequences for escherichia coli (p<0.001), but relatively depleted in a subset of clostridiales  (p<0.05). pcr of mucosal dna was negative for mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis, shigella and listeria. the number of e. coli in situ correlated with the severity of ileal disease (rho 0.621, p<0.001) and invasive e. coli was  restricted to inflamed mucosa. e. coli strains isolated from the ileum were predominantly novel in phylogeny, displayed pathogen-like behavior in vitro and harbored chromosomal and episomal elements similar to those described in extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli and pathogenic enterobacteriaceae. these data  establish that dysbiosis of the ileal mucosa-associated flora correlates with an  ileal crohn's disease (icd) phenotype, and raise the possibility that a selective increase in a novel group of invasive e. coli is involved in the etiopathogenesis to crohn's disease involving the ileum.
