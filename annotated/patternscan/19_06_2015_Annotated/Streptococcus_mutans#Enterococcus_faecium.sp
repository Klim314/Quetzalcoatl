TI  == in vitro fermentation of lactulose by human gut bacteria.
AB  == lactulose has been known as a prebiotic that can selectively stimulate the growth of beneficial bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. recent studies have indicated that streptococcus mutans, clostridium perfringens, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii are also able to utilize lactulose. however, the previous studies mainly focused  on the utilization of lactulose by individual strains, and few studies were designed to identify the species that could utilize lactulose among gut microbiota. this study aimed to identify lactulose-metabolizing bacteria in the human gut, using in silico and traditional culture methods. the prediction results suggested that genes for the transporters and glycosidases of lactulose are well distributed in the genomes of 222 of 453 strains of gastrointestinal-tract bacteria. the screening assays identified 35 species with  the ability to utilize lactulose, of which cronobacter sakazakii, enterococcus faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas putida were reported for the first time to be capable of utilizing lactulose. in addition, significant correlations between lactulose and galactooligosaccharide metabolism were found.  thus, more attention should be paid to bacteria besides bifidobacteria and lactobacilli to further investigate the relationship between functional oligosaccharides and gut bacteria.

TI  == isolation and characterization of bacteriocin-producing bacteria from the intestinal microbiota of elderly irish subjects.
AB  == aims: to isolate and characterize bacteriocins produced by predominant species of lactic acid bacteria from faeces of elderly subjects. methods and results: screening over 70,000 colonies, from faecal samples collected from 266 subjects,  using the indicator organisms lactobacillus bulgaricus lmg 6901 and listeria innocua dpc 3572, identified 55 antimicrobial-producing bacteria. genomic fingerprinting following apai digestion revealed 15 distinct strains. the antimicrobial activities associated with 13 of the 15 strains were sensitive to protease treatment. the predominant antimicrobial-producing species were identified as lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus and enterococcus spp. a number of previously characterized bacteriocins, including abp-118 and salivaricin b (from lact. salivarius), enterocin b (enterococcus faecium), lactacin b (lact. acidophilus),  gassericin t and a variant of gassericin a (lact. gasseri), were identified. interestingly, two antimicrobial-producing species, not generally associated with intestinally derived microorganisms were also isolated: lactococcus lactis producing nisin z and streptococcus mutans producing mutacin ii. conclusion: these data suggest that bacteriocin production by intestinal isolates against our chosen targets under the screening conditions used was not frequent (0.08%). significance and impact of the study: the results presented are important due to  growing evidence indicating bacteriocin production as a potential probiotic trait by virtue of strain dominance and/or pathogen inhibition in the mammalian intestine.

TI  == synergistic effects between silver nanoparticles and antibiotics and the mechanisms involved.
AB  == silver nanoparticles (nano-ags), which have well-known antimicrobial properties,  are used extensively in various medical and general applications. in this study,  the combination effects between nano-ags and the conventional antibiotics ampicillin, chloramphenicol and kanamycin against various pathogenic bacteria were investigated. the mic and fractional inhibitory concentration index (fici) were determined to confirm antibacterial susceptibility and synergistic effects.  the results showed that nano-ags possessed antibacterial effects and synergistic  activities. the antibiofilm activities of nano-ags alone or in combination with antibiotics were also investigated. formation of biofilm is associated with resistance to antimicrobial agents and chronic bacterial infections. the results  indicated that nano-ags also had antibiofilm activities. to understand these effects of nano-ags, an atpase inhibitor assay, permeability assay and hydroxyl radical assay were conducted. the antibacterial activity of nano-ags was influenced by atp-associated metabolism rather than by the permeability of the outer membrane. additionally, nano-ags generated hydroxyl radicals, a highly reactive oxygen species induced by bactericidal agents. it was concluded that nano-ags have potential as a combination therapeutic agent for the treatment of infectious diseases by bacteria.

TI  == enterococcus faecium wb2000 inhibits biofilm formation by oral cariogenic streptococci.
AB  == this study investigated the inhibitory effect of probiotic enterococcus faecium wb2000 on biofilm formation by cariogenic streptococci. the ability of e. faecium wb2000 and jcm5804 and enterococcus faecalis jcm5803 to inhibit biofilm formation by seven laboratory oral streptococcal strains and 13 clinical mutans streptococcal strains was assayed. the enterococcal strains inhibited biofilm formation in dual cultures with the mutans streptococcal strains streptococcus mutans xc and streptococcus sobrinus jcm5176 (p < 0.05), but not with the noncariogenic streptococcal strains. enterococcus faecium wb2000 inhibited biofilm formation by 90.0% (9/10) of the clinical s. mutans strains and 100% (3/3) of the clinical s. sobrinus strains. after culturing, the ph did not differ between single and dual cultures. the viable counts of floating mutans streptococci were lower in dual cultures with e. faecium wb2000 than in single cultures. enterococcus faecium wb2000 acted as a probiotic bacterial inhibitor of cariogenic streptococcal biofilm formation.

TI  == persistent, toxin-antitoxin system-independent, tetracycline resistance-encoding  plasmid from a dairy enterococcus faecium isolate.
AB  == a tetracycline-resistant (tet(r)) dairy enterococcus faecium isolate designated m7m2 was found to carry both tet(m) and tet(l) genes on a 19.6-kb plasmid. after  consecutive transfer in the absence of tetracycline, the resistance-encoding plasmid persisted in 99% of the progenies. dna sequence analysis revealed that the 19.6-kb plasmid contained 28 open reading frames (orfs), including a tet(m)-tet(l)-mob gene cluster, as well as a 10.6-kb backbone highly homologous (99.9%) to the reported plasmid pre25, but without an identified toxin-antitoxin  (ta) plasmid stabilization system. the derived backbone plasmid without the tet(r) determinants exhibited a 100% retention rate in the presence of acridine orange, suggesting the presence of a ta-independent plasmid stabilization mechanism, with its impact on the persistence of a broad spectrum of resistance-encoding traits still to be elucidated. the tet(m)-tet(l) gene cluster from m7m2 was functional and transmissible and led to acquired resistance in enterococcus faecalis og1rf by electroporation and in streptococcus mutans ua159  by natural transformation. southern hybridization showed that both the tet(m) and tet(l) genes were integrated into the chromosome of s. mutans ua159, while the whole plasmid was transferred to and retained in e. faecalis og1rf. quantitative  real-time reverse transcription-pcr (rt-pcr) indicated tetracycline-induced transcription of both the tet(m) and tet(l) genes of pm7m2. the results indicated that multiple mechanisms might have contributed to the persistence of antibiotic  resistance-encoding genes and that the plasmids pm7m2, pip816, and pre25 are likely correlated evolutionarily.

TI  == high-level fluorescence labeling of gram-positive pathogens.
AB  == fluorescence labeling of bacterial pathogens has a broad range of interesting applications including the observation of living bacteria within host cells. we constructed a novel vector based on the e. coli streptococcal shuttle plasmid pat28 that can propagate in numerous bacterial species from different genera. the plasmid harbors a promoterless copy of the green fluorescent variant gene egfp under the control of the camp-factor gene (cfb) promoter of streptococcus agalactiae and was designated pbsu101. upon transfer of the plasmid into streptococci, the bacteria show a distinct and easily detectable fluorescence using a standard fluorescence microscope and quantification by facs-analysis demonstrated values that were 10-50 times increased over the respective controls. to assess the suitability of the construct for high efficiency fluorescence labeling in different gram-positive pathogens, numerous species were transformed. we successfully labeled streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus anginosus and staphylococcus aureus strains utilizing the egfp reporter plasmid pbsu101. in all of these species the presence of the cfb promoter construct resulted in high-level egfp expression that could be further increased by growing the streptococcal and enterococcal cultures under high oxygen conditions through continuous aeration.

TI  == streptococcus
AB  == the genus streptococcus , a heterogeneous group of gram-positive bacteria, has broad significance in medicine and industry. various streptococci are important ecologically as part of the normal microbial flora of animals and humans; some can also cause diseases that range from subacute to acute or even chronic. among  the significant human diseases attributable to streptococci are scarlet fever, rheumatic heart disease, glomerulonephritis, and pneumococcal pneumonia. streptococci are essential in industrial and dairy processes and as indicators of pollution. the nomenclature for streptococci, especially the nomenclature in medical use, has been based largely on serogroup identification of cell wall components rather than on species names. for several decades, interest has focused on two major species that cause severe infections: s pyogenes (group a streptococci) and s pneumoniae (pneumococci). in 1984, two members were assigned  a new genus - the group d enterococcal species (which account for 98% of human enterococcal infections) became enterococcus faecalis (the majority of human clinical isolates) and e faecium (associated with a remarkable capacity for antibiotic resistance). in recent years, increasing attention has been given to other streptococcal species, partly because innovations in serogrouping methods have led to advances in understanding the pathogenetic and epidemiologic significance of these species. a variety of cell-associated and extracellular products are produced by streptococci, but their cause-effect relationship with pathogenesis has not been defined. some of the other medically important streptococci are s agalactiae (group b), an etiologic agent of neonatal disease;  e faecalis (group d), a major cause of endocarditis, and the viridans streptococci. particularly for the viridans streptococci, taxonomy and nomenclature are not yet fully reliable or consistent. important members of the viridans streptococci, normal commensals, include s mutans and s sanguis (involved in dental caries), s mitis (associated with bacteremia, meningitis, periodontal disease and pneumonia), and "s milleri" (associated with suppurative  infections in children and adults). there remains persistent taxonomic confusion  regarding "s milleri." these and other streptococci of medical importance are listed intable 13-1by serogroup designation, normal ecologic niche, and associated disease.

TI  == inhibiting effects of enterococcus faecium non-biofilm strain on streptococcus mutans biofilm formation.
AB  == background and purpose: enterococcus faecium is a normal bowel commensal and lactic acid bacterium that is rarely found in the oral cavity. this study investigated whether a non-pathogenic and non-biofilm strain of e. faecium functioned as a probiotic strain toward biofilm formation by streptococcus mutans, which is an etiological agent for dental caries. methods: the effects of  e. faecium on streptococcal biofilm was evaluated by absorbance of safranin-stained biofilm at 492 nm in a 96-well microtiter plate. results: the e. faecium strain demonstrated cell-number-dependent inhibition of biofilm in dual cultures with 4 laboratory and 16 clinical s. mutans strains, as well as laboratory strains of streptococcus sobrinus and streptococcus sanguinis, in 96-well microtiter plates. the inhibiting effects of e. faecium were not dependent on the production of bacteriocin from streptococci and e. faecium, low  ph after mix culture, or biofilm formation levels of s. mutans. a culture supernatant sample of more than 10 kda from e. faecium showed direct inhibiting effects toward s. mutans biofilm formation. treatment of heat, butanol, and phenol to a supernatant sample restored biofilm formation in culture of s. mutans with the sample. moreover, the tendencies of inhibition levels by the supernatant sample were associated with those by bacterial cells of e. faecium to s. mutans strains. conclusions: the e. faecium non-biofilm strain produced an inhibiting protein to streptococci biofilm formation, showed various susceptibilities to inhibit streptococcal biofilm, and acted as a probiotic bacterial inhibitor of streptococcal biofilm formation.

TI  == association of streptococcus pluranimalium with valvular endocarditis and septicaemia in adult broiler parents.
AB  == the genus streptococcus consists of more than 60 species, but only streptococcus  equi subspecies zooepidemicus, streptococcus gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus, streptococcus gallinaceus, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus suis have been isolated from poultry. during investigations of the  aetiology of increased mortality in broiler parent stock at the end of production, pure cultures of streptococcal-like organisms that could not be classified among these six species were obtained from 24 cases of septicaemia or  valvular endocarditis and septicaemia. phenotypic characterization using the api20 strep kit identified the isolates as aerococcus viridans (10), aerococcus urinae (2), leuconostoc species (4), streptococcus salivarius (2), streptococcus  bovis ii 3 (1), enterococcus avium (3), enterococcus faecium (1) or gemella morbillorum (1). however, this identification was misleading as subsequent genetic investigations using pulse field gel electrophoresis and sequencing of 16s rrna genes showed that 19 isolates were classified as streptococcus pluranimalium, while the remaining isolates were e. avium (3), e. faecium (1) or  lactobacillus species (1). misidentification by api20 strep was related to the database provided by the manufacturer, as the phenotypic characteristics could identify these organisms as s. pluranimalium. the isolates of s. pluranimalium belonged to at least three different clones as determined by pulsed field gel electrophoresis of smai-digested genomic dna. the capacity that these isolates had to colonize the valvular endothelium was suggested by the occurrence of valvular endocarditis in 12 of 19 cases. demonstration of the same clone in all four houses on a farm suggested the pathogenic potential of this organism.

TI  == analysis of the prevalence of tetracycline resistance genes in clinical isolates  of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium in a japanese hospital.
AB  == prevalence of seven tetracycline resistance (tc(r)) genes--tet(l), tet(m), tet(k), tet(o), tet(s), tet(t), and tet(u)--which are known to be distributed to  gram-positive cocci was analyzed for 224 enterococcus faecalis and 46 enterococcus faecium clinical isolates obtained in a japanese hospital. any of the tc(r) genes was detected in 75.9% of all the enterococcal strains. the tet(m) was detected at highest rates in both e. faecalis (75.0%) and e. faecium (69.6%), followed by tet(l), which was harbored in 6.7% of e. faecalis isolates and 30.4%  of e. faecium isolates. the tet(o), tet(s), and tet(t) were detected in e. faecalis at low frequencies mostly associated with tet(m), while tet(k) and tet(u) were not detected. nucleotide sequences of tet(s) from e. faecalis strains were identical to that reported in listeria monocytogenes. sequences of tet(o) from two e. faecalis strains were almost identical to each other and also to those from streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus mutans, campylobacter jejuni, and campylobacter coli, although minor sequence divergence was observed. the tet(t), which had been reported only in streptococcus pyogenes, was found in five e. faecalis strains. sequence of the enterococcal tet(t) differed from that of s. pyogenes by only four nucleotides (four amino acids) and showed high sequence identity (99.8%, amino acid level). enterococcal strains with any one tc(r) gene or those with two tc(r) genes showed generally similar mics of tetracyclines, and no evident difference in resistance  level was observed.

TI  == an enterococcus faecium secreted antigen, saga, exhibits broad-spectrum binding to extracellular matrix proteins and appears essential for e. faecium growth.
AB  == a gene encoding a major secreted antigen, saga, was identified in enterococcus faecium by screening an e. faecium genomic expression library with sera from patients with e. faecium-associated endocarditis. recombinant saga protein showed broad-spectrum binding to extracellular matrix (ecm) proteins, including fibrinogen, collagen type i, collagen type iv, fibronectin, and laminin. a fibrinogen-binding protein, purified from culture supernatants of an e. faecium clinical isolate, was found to match the n-terminal sequence of the predicted saga protein and to react with the anti-saga antibody, confirming that it was the saga protein; this protein appeared as an 80- to 90-kda smear on a western blot that was sensitive to proteinase k and resistant to periodate treatment and glycoprotein staining. when overexpressed in e. faecium and escherichia coli, the native and recombinant saga proteins formed stable oligomers, apparently via their c-terminal domains. the saga protein is composed of three domains: (i) a putative coiled-coil n-terminal domain that shows homology to the n-terminal domain of streptococcus mutans saga protein (42% similarity), previously shown to be involved in cell wall integrity and cell shape maintenance, and to the p45 protein of listeria monocytogenes (41% similarity); (ii) a central domain containing direct repeats; and (iii) a c-terminal domain that is similar to that  found in various proteins, including p45 (50% similarity) and p60 (52% similarity) of l. monocytogenes. the p45 and p60 proteins both have cell wall hydrolase activity, and the latter has also been shown to be involved in virulence, whereas cell wall hydrolase activity was not detected for saga protein. the e. faecium saga gene, like the s. mutans homologue, is located in a  cluster of genes encoding proteins that appear to be involved in cell wall metabolism and could not be disrupted unless it was first transcomplemented, suggesting that the saga gene is essential for e. faecium growth and may be involved in cell wall metabolism. in conclusion, the extracelluar e. faecium saga protein is apparently essential for growth, shows broad-spectrum binding to ecm proteins, forms oligomers, and is antigenic during infection.

TI  == different bacteriocin activities of streptococcus mutans reflect distinct phylogenetic lineages.
AB  == bacteriocins produced by mutans streptococci are known as mutacins. in this study 16 broadly active mutacin-producing streptococcus mutans strains from new zealand, north america and europe were classified into four groups (a-d) on the basis of differences in their activity in deferred antagonism tests against either the homologous producer strain (to test for presence of self-immunity) or  indicator strains staphylococcus aureus 46 and enterococcus faecium te1. two of the strains included in the study (ua140 and ua96) were representatives of the group i and ii mutacin producer strains previously described by caufield and co-workers. one of the new zealand isolates of group a (s. mutans strain n) appeared to produce inhibitory activity similar to that of the group i prototype  strain ua140. four other new zealand isolates of group b (s. mutans strains m19,  m34, b34 and d14) had mutacin ii-like activity. the group b mutacin producers differed from the group a mutacin producers in their additional activity against  staph. aureus 46. seven s. mutans strains (m46, b46, b57, m12, m28, b28 and 13m)  were distinguished from the group a and group b mutacin producers in that they inhibited e. faecium te1. these were called group c mutacin producers. strains h7 and h23 resembled the group c strains in their action on both indicator strains te1 and 46. however, these two strains failed to exhibit immunity to their own inhibitory products in the deferred antagonism test and were separately classified as group d mutacin producers. phylogenetic analysis of the strains by  several genotypic and phenotypic characteristics revealed that the mutacin groups were associated with distinct evolutionary lineages of s. mutans.

TI  == inhibition by yeast killer toxin-like antibodies of oral streptococci adhesion to tooth surfaces in an ex vivo model.
AB  == background: monoclonal (ktmab) and recombinant (ktscfv) anti-idiotypic antibodies, representing the internal image of a yeast killer toxin, proved to be microbicidal in vitro against important eukaryotic and prokaryotic pathogens such as candida albicans, pneumocystis carinii, mycobacterium tuberculosis, staphylococcus aureus, s. haemolyticus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae, including multidrug-resistant strains. ktmab and ktscfv exerted a strong therapeutic effect in well-established animal models of candidiasis and pneumocystosis. streptococcus mutans is the most important etiologic agent of dental caries that might result from the metabolic end products of dental plaque. effective strategies to reduce the disease potential of dental plaque have considered the possibility of using antibiotics or antibodies against oral streptococci in general and s. mutans in particular. in this study, the activity of ktmab and ktscfv against s. mutans and the inhibition and reduction by ktmab of dental colonization by s. mutans and other oral streptococci in an ex vivo model of human teeth were investigated. materials and  methods: ktscfv and ktmab were used in a conventional colony forming unit (cfu) assay against a serotype c strain of s. mutans, and other oral streptococci (s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. salivarius). an ex vivo model of human teeth submerged in saliva was used to establish ktmab potential of inhibiting or reducing the adhesion to dental surfaces by s. mutans and other oral streptococci. results: ktmab and ktscfv kill in vitro s. mutans and other oral streptococci. ktmab inhibit colonization of dental surfaces by s. mutans and oral streptococci in the ex vivo model. conclusions: killer antibodies with antibiotic activity or their engineered derivatives may have a potential in the prevention of dental caries in vivo.

AB  == bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to china with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. in this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. the cell growth of streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of s. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. the bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on s. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); ph, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including s. mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, actinomyces viscosus, and porphyromonas gingivalis, with mics ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of s. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of  ph in the broth. thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.

TI  == a novel is-like element frequently inserted in a putative virulence regulator in  bovine mastitis isolates of streptococcus dysgalactiae.
AB  == streptococcus dysgalactiae, a lancefield group c streptococcus, is commonly isolated from bovine mastitis. we recently identified a putative regulon in two s. dysgalactiae strains, 8215 and epi9, consisting of two consecutive genes, dmg  and dem, coding for a possible regulatory protein and an m-like protein with fibrinogen- and igg-binding-properties, respectively. during these studies a short sequence homologous to an is element was found to be inserted in the dmg gene of strain 8215. the present investigation describes the complete sequence of this is-like element, named issdy1, which consists of 1218 bp and contains two orfs, flanked by imperfect repeats. the nucleotide sequence of the is-like element shows 82% identity to the previously reported sequence of is199 from streptococcus mutans v403. the deduced amino acid sequences of the orfs also revealed high homology to transposases from is elements in enterococcus faecium,  escherichia coli, and shigella dysenteriae, all belonging to the is3 family. we studied the distribution of issdy1 in 57 s. dysgalactiae isolates using pcr analysis with specific primers derived from the is element. ninety-eight percent  of the isolates contained the issdy1 element. surprisingly, in the majority of studied strains a copy of the is-like element was found to be inserted in the dmg gene, a putative virulence regulator.

TI  == interspecies recombination between enterococci: genetic and phenotypic diversity  of vancomycin-resistant transconjugants.
AB  == handwerger and colleagues demonstrated that a particular clinical isolate of enterococcus faecium, designated guc, and here redesignated as gucr, can conjugatively transfer vancomycin resistance. the vancomycin resistance is encoded by a chromosomally born linked set of genes in the donor, designated the  vana cluster, to the chromosome of an e. faecalis recipient, jh2-2. here it is reported that an earlier isolate of e. faecium from the same patient who later harbored the vancomycin-resistant e. faecium gucr lacks the vana gene cluster but is otherwise similar (by smai chromosomal fingerprint and metabolic fingerprinting) to the vancomycin-resistant gucr. therefore, "gucs" is a strong suspect as the base strain for the clinical acquisition of the vana cluster present in gucr. thirteen laboratory-generated vana transconjugants derived from  conjugation between gucr and jh2-2 were subjected to further analysis, allowing a comparison between transfer in the laboratory and transfer that occurred in the clinical setting. surprisingly, each jh2-2 transconjugant had a unique constellation of abilities to oxidize various members of a panel of potential carbon sources. this pattern was stable for each transconjugant, and it was not changed by growing the strains with or without vancomycin. transconjugants had pulsed-field gel electrophoretic (pfge) patterns largely consistent with that of  jh2-2, the recipient in conjugation experiments. however, pfge analysis showed that a large but variable amount of dna, between 145 kb and 277 kb, was transferred into different transconjugants. the mechanism appears to be conjugative transposition in which new dna is added to the pre-existing genome rather than substituting for a segment in the recipient. mapping and hybridization studies of several transconjugants showed that each received similar, but not exactly the same, dna fragment of at least 30 kb from the donor. sequencing of 16s ribosomal genes was used to confirm that the recipient and donor strains used in transconjugation experiments were different species. sequence analysis was also used to consider the possibility that rrna operons might be mobilized in conjugation, but no evidence for the transfer of rdna operons was found. an apparent insertion sequence in e. faecium almost identical  to is 1485 and 57% sequence identity to is 199 of streptococcus mutans was found  in the region of dna transferred. the results imply new consequences of conjugative transfer and interspecies recombination.

AB  == an internal fragment representing approximately 85% of sod genes from seven gram-positive bacteria was amplified by using degenerate primers in a polymerase  chain reaction assay. the dna sequences of sod polymerase chain reaction products from clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactococcus lactis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes were determined. comparisons of their deduced amino acid sequences with those of the corresponding regions of  the sod proteins from bacillus stearothermophilus, listeria monocytogenes, and streptococcus mutans revealed strong relatedness. phylogenetic analysis of sod peptides showed that members of the genera streptococcus and those of the genera  enterococcus constitute two well-supported monophyletic groups. the method described in this study provides a means for easy recovery of sod genes and the construction of sod mutants of various gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == determination of the chromosomal size of three different strains of enterococcus  faecalis and one strain of enterococcus faecium.
AB  == pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used to determine the chromosomal size of three different strains of enterococcus faecalis and one strain of enterococcus faecium. the size determinations of og1x, a strain of e. faecalis widely used in  many laboratories for genetic studies, using sma i, not i, and sfi i alone or in  combination, ranged from 2,750 to 2,761 kb. using the same enzymes as with og1x,  the size of hh-67, a plasmid-free clinical isolate of e. faecalis, was determined to be 2,170-2,288 kb and the size of jh2-2, an e. faecalis recipient strain, ranged from 2,008 to 2,135 kb. the size range generated for ge-1, a plasmid-free  e. faecium strain, with the use of sma i, not i, and apa i was 2,045-2,155 kb. although og1x differed in size from the other three enterococci, each individual  enterococcal strain generated reproducible results in different experiments. however, for both e. faecalis og1x and e. faecium ge-1, one of the enzymes used generated a considerably smaller molecular size than that generated by the other  two enzymes. the discrepancy was due to visually undiscernible comigrating fragments, and serves to point out a potential source of error if fewer than two  enzymes are used to size a genome. the size discrepancies were resolved by digesting individual fragments with a second enzyme. the molecular sizes of these enterococcal strains are larger than that recently reported for campylobacter, smaller than that of escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and similar (og1x) or smaller (jh2-2, hh67, and ge-1) than the 2,819-kb reported for streptococcus mutans.

TI  == dna probe for identification of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == a total of 287 clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) were  tested for their ability to undergo autolysis when treated with sodium deoxycholate. the test was positive for all but one isolate, strain doc-1. this autolysis required the activity of an enzyme which is unique and characteristic of s. pneumoniae: a choline-dependent n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase, the gene product of the lyta gene. we used lyta as a dna probe to test the distribution of the autolysin gene among clinical isolates of s. pneumoniae. in dot blot hybridization experiments our probe reacted with the dna of 60 of 60 strains tested, including the autolysis-deficient clinical isolate doc-1. no hybridization occurred when strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus (enterococcus) faecalis, streptococcus (enterococcus) faecium, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus bovis were tested. the lyta gene appears to be an ideal candidate for use as a dna probe for the identification of s. pneumoniae.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of streptococcus.
AB  == a numerical taxonomic study of strains of streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. the major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (s. faecalis, s. faecium, 's. avium' and a proposed new species 's. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (s. bovis, s. equinus, s. salivarius, 's. casseliflavus', s. mutans, s. raffinolactis and an unidentified oral group i); (c) lactic species group (s. lactis including s. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (s. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (s. mitis, s. sanguis, a proposed new species 's. oralis' and 's. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. equi, 's. equisimilis' including 's. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of lancefield group b strains of human origin);  (g) parapyogenic species group (s. uberis, 's. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of lancefield groups r, s and t). species of aerococcus, gemella, leuconostoc and pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.

TI  == acid production from lycasin, maltitol, sorbitol and xylitol by oral streptococci and lactobacilli.
AB  == the acid production from maltitol was compared with the acid production from hydrogenated starch hydrolysate (lycasin), sorbitol and xylitol by a number of oral strains and reference strains of streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. mitior, s. milleri, s. faecalis, s. faecium, s. avium, lactobacillus casei and l. salivarius. the polyols were added to a final concentration of 1.0% to two different basal media. incubation was performed at 37 degrees c for 7 days after which the ph was recorded. maltitol was fermented only by the lactobacilli (about two thirds of the strains). lycasin was fermented by all strains of s. faecalis, more than 90% of the lactobacilli, about half of the s. sanguis strains, about one third of the s. mutans strains, and by a few other streptococcal strains. acid production from sorbitol was observed among more than 80% of the s. mutans strains and the s. faecalis strains and most of the lactobacilli strains. sorbitol-fermenting strains of s. sanguis and of s. mitior, all isolated from sorbitol-consumers, were observed. no other sorbitol-fermenting streptococci were found. only the reference strains l. salivarius subsp. salivarius atcc 11741 and s. avium atcc 14025 fermented xylitol.

TI  == synthesis and excretion of glycerol teichoic acid during growth of two streptococcal species.
AB  == examination of both supernatant culture medium and cell pellets after exponential- and stationary-phase growth of streptococcus mutans strain fa-1 and  streptococcus faecalis atcc 9790 (s. faecium) showed the presence of [-3h]glycerol-labeled material that possessed several of the properties of glycerol teichoic acid. in the supernatant medium of s. mutans fa-1, an apparently large-molecular-size material, which eluted from agarose columns with  the kd value expected of a lipoteichoic acid, was observed. large amounts of this material were present in supernatants during the stationary phase. in contrast, with s. faecalis only an apparently lower-molecular-weight form, with a kd consistent with deacylated glycerol teichoic acid, was found in the growth medium. both organisms had high-molecular-weight lipoteichoic acid in the cells along with the deacylated glycerol teichoic acid. the presence of relatively large amounts of glycerol teichoic acids in the medium was considered to be a result of excretion of these compounds rather than a result of cellular lysis.
