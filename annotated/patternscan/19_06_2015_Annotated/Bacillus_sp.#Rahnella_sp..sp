TI  == aerobic microbial community of insectary population of phlebotomus papatasi.
AB  == background: microbes particularly bacteria presenting in the gut of haematophagous insects may have an important role in the epidemiology of human infectious disease. methods: the microbial flora of gut and surrounding environmental of a laboratory strain of phlebotomus papatasi, the main vector of  zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (zcl) in the old world, was investigated. biochemical reactions and 16s rdna sequencing of the isolated bacteria against 24 sugars and amino acids were used for bacteria species identification. common mycological media used for fungi identification as well. results: most isolates belonged to the enterobacteriaceae, a large, heterogeneous group of gram-negative rods whose natural habitat is the intestinal tract of humans and animals. enterobacteriaceae groups included edwardsiella, enterobacter, escherichia, klebsiella, kluyvera, leminorella, pantoea, proteus, providencia, rahnella, serratia, shigella, tatumella, and yersinia and non enterobacteriaceae groups included bacillus, staphylococcus and pseudomonas. the most prevalent isolates were proteus mirabilis and p. vulgaris. these saprophytic and swarming motile bacteria were isolated from all immature, pupae, and mature fed or unfed male or  female sand flies as well as from larval and adult food sources. five fungi species were also isolated from sand flies, their food sources and colonization materials where candida sp. was common in all mentioned sources. conclusion: midgut microbiota are increasingly seen as an important factor for modulating vector competence in insect vectors so their possible effects of the mirobiota on the biology of p. papatasi and their roles in the sandfly-leishmania interaction  are discussed.

TI  == effects of ensiling fermentation and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community in italian ryegrass, guinea grass, and whole-crop maize silages stored  at high moisture content.
AB  == the effects of storage period and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community were examined in italian ryegrass (ir), guinea grass (gg), and whole-crop maize (wm) silages. direct-cut forages were stored in a laboratory silo for 3, 7, 14, 28, 56, and 120 d without any additives; live counts, content  of fermentation products, and characteristics of the bacterial community were determined. 2,3-butanediol, acetic acid, and lactic acid were the dominant fermentation products in the ir, gg, and wm silages, respectively. the acetic acid content increased as a result of prolonged ensiling, regardless of the type  of silage crop, and the changes were distinctively visible from the beginning of  gg ensiling. pantoea agglomerans, rahnella aquatilis, and enterobacter sp. were the major bacteria in the ir silage, indicating that alcoholic fermentation may be due to the activity of enterobacteria. staphylococcus sciuri and bacillus pumilus were detected when ir silage was spoiled, whereas between aerobically stable and unstable silages, no differences were seen in the bacterial community  at silo opening. lactococcus lactis was a representative bacterium, although acetic acid was the major fermentation product in the gg silage. lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, and morganella morganii were suggested to be associated with the increase in acetic acid due to prolonged storage. enterobacter cloacae appeared when the gg silage was spoiled. in the wm silage, no distinctive changes due to prolonged ensiling were seen in the bacterial community. throughout the ensiling, weissella paramesenteroides, weissella confusa, and klebsiella pneumoniae were present in addition to l. plantarum, l. brevis, and l. lactis. upon deterioration, acetobacter pasteurianus, klebsiella variicola, enterobacter hormaechei, and bacillus gibsonii were detected. these results demonstrate the diverse bacterial community that evolves during ensiling  and aerobic spoilage of ir, gg, and wm silages.

TI  == diversity of sporadic symbionts and nonsymbiotic endophytic bacteria isolated from nodules of woody, shrub, and food legumes in ethiopia.
AB  == fifty-five bacterial isolates were obtained from surface-sterilized nodules of woody and shrub legumes growing in ethiopia: crotalaria spp., indigofera spp., and erythrina brucei, and the food legumes soybean and common bean. based on partial 16s rrna gene sequence analysis, the majority of the isolates were identified as gram-negative bacteria belonging to the genera achromobacter, agrobacterium, burkholderia, cronobacter, enterobacter, mesorhizobium, novosphingobium, pantoea, pseudomonas, rahnella, rhizobium, serratia, and variovorax. seven isolates were gram-positive bacteria belonging to the genera bacillus, paenibacillus, planomicrobium, and rhodococcus. amplified fragment length polymorphism (aflp) fingerprinting showed that each strain was genetically distinct. according to phylogenetic analysis of reca, glnii, rpob, and 16s rrna gene sequences, rhizobium, mesorhizobium, and agrobacterium were further classified into six different genospecies: agrobacterium spp., agrobacterium radiobacter, rhizobium sp., rhizobium phaseoli, mesorhizobium sp., and putative new rhizobium species. the strains from r. phaseoli, rhizobium sp. iar30, and mesorhizobium sp. err6 induced nodules on their host plants. the other strains did not form nodules on their original host. nine endophytic bacterial strains representing seven genera, agrobacterium, burkholderia, paenibacillus, pantoea, pseudomonas, rhizobium, and serratia, were found to colonize nodules of crotalaria incana and common bean on co-inoculation with symbiotic rhizobia. four endophytic rhizobium and two agrobacterium strains had identical nifh gene sequences with symbiotic rhizobium strains, suggesting horizontal gene transfer.  most symbiotic and nonsymbiotic endophytic bacteria showed plant growth-promoting properties in vitro, which indicate their potential role in the promotion of plant growth when colonizing plant roots and the rhizosphere.

TI  == comparative analysis of midgut bacterial communities of aedes aegypti mosquito strains varying in vector competence to dengue virus.
AB  == differences in midgut bacterial communities of aedes aegypti, the primary mosquito vector of dengue viruses (denv), might influence the susceptibility of these mosquitoes to infection by denv. as a first step toward addressing this hypothesis, comparative analysis of bacterial communities from midguts of mosquito strains with differential genetic susceptibility to denv was performed.  16s rrna gene libraries and real-time pcr approaches were used to characterize midgut bacterial community composition and abundance in three aedes aegypti strains: moyo, moyo-r, and moyo-s. although pseudomonas spp.-related clones were  predominant across all libraries, some interesting and potentially significant differences were found in midgut bacterial communities among the three strains. pedobacter sp.- and janthinobacterium sp.-related phylotypes were identified only in the moyo-r strain libraries, while bacillus sp. was detected only in the moyo-s strain. rahnella sp. was found in moyo-r and moyo strains libraries but was absent in moyo-s libraries. both 16s rrna gene library and real-time pcr approaches confirmed the presence of pedobacter sp. only in the moyo-r strain. further, real-time pcr-based quantification of 16s rrna gene copies showed bacterial abundance in midguts of the moyo-r strain mosquitoes to be at least 10-100-folds higher than in the moyo-s and moyo strain mosquitoes. our study identified some putative bacteria with characteristic physiological properties that could affect the infectivity of dengue virus. this analysis represents the first report of comparisons of midgut bacterial communities with respect to refractoriness and susceptibility of aedes aegypti mosquitoes to denv and will guide future efforts to address the potential interactive role of midgut bacteria of aedes aegypti mosquitoes in determining vectorial capacity for denv.

TI  == bacteria from ips sexdentatus (coleoptera: curculionidae) and their biocontrol potential.
AB  == ips sexdentatus (coleoptera: curculionidae) is one of the most destructive pests  of the spruce trees in europe. in this study, we have isolated and characterized  culturable bacteria from i. sexdentatus and tested their insecticidal activity against the last instar larvae of the pest as a possible biocontrol agent. a total of eight bacterial isolates was determined and four of them were identified at species level, and the others were identified at genus level. isolates were identified as stenotrophomonas maltophilia (is1), rahnella sp. (is2), pseudomonas sp. (is3), bacillus sp. (is4), alcaligenes faecalis (is5), panteoea agglomerans (is6), pseudomonas fluorescens (is7) and serratia sp. (is8) based on their morphological, biochemical and molecular characteristics. insecticidal effects of bacterial isolates were performed on the last instar larvae of the pest. the highest insecticidal activity was obtained from p. fluorescens (is7) with 73% mortality within 10 days after inoculation (p < 0.05). mortality values of the other isolates ranged from 20 to 53%. this study suggests that pseudomonas fluorescens (is7) seems to be a good candidate as a possible biocontrol agent against i. sexdentatus, and provides suitable strains that can be modified to express insecticidal toxins and/or other detrimental substances to develop new control methods for i. sexdentatus.

TI  == identification of the midgut microbiota of an. stephensi and an. maculipennis for their application as a paratransgenic tool against malaria.
AB  == the midgut microbiota associated with anopheles stephensi and anopheles maculipennis (diptera: culicidae) was investigated for development of a paratransgenesis-based approach to control malaria transmission in eastern mediterranean region (emr). here, we present the results of a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and biochemical-based approaches to identify the female adult and  larvae mosquitoe microbiota of these two major malaria vectors, originated from south eastern and north of iran. plating the mosquito midgut contents from lab-reared and field-collected anopheles spp. was used for microbiota isolation.  the gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial colonies were identified by gram staining and specific mediums. selected colonies were identified by differential  biochemical tests and 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. a number of 10 an. stephensi and 32 an. maculipennis adult mosquitoes and 15 an. stephensi and 7 an. maculipennis larvae were analyzed and 13 sequences of 16s rrna gene bacterial species were retrieved, that were categorized in 3 classes and 8 families. the majority of the identified bacteria were belonged to the gamma-proteobacteria class, including pseudomonas sp. and aeromonas sp. and the others were some closely related to those found in other vector mosquitoes, including pantoea, acinetobacter, brevundimonas, bacillus, sphingomonas, lysinibacillus and rahnella. the 16s rrna sequences in the current study aligned with the reference  strains available in genbank were used for construction of the phylogenetic tree  that revealed the relatedness among the bacteria identified. the presented data strongly encourage further investigations, to verify the potential role of the detected bacteria for the malaria control in iran and neighboring countries.

TI  == aerobic uranium (vi) bioprecipitation by metal-resistant bacteria isolated from radionuclide- and metal-contaminated subsurface soils.
AB  == in this study, the immobilization of toxic uranium [u(vi)] mediated by the intrinsic phosphatase activities of naturally occurring bacteria isolated from contaminated subsurface soils was examined. the phosphatase phenotypes of strains belonging to the genera, arthrobacter, bacillus and rahnella, previously isolated from subsurface soils at the us department of energy's (doe) oak ridge field research center (orfrc), were determined. the orfrc represents a unique, extreme  environment consisting of highly acidic soils with co-occurring heavy metals, radionuclides and high nitrate concentrations. isolates exhibiting phosphatase-positive phenotypes indicative of constitutive phosphatase activity were subsequently tested in u(vi) bioprecipitation assays. when aerobically grown in synthetic groundwater (ph 5.5) amended with 10 mm glycerol-3-phosphate (g3p),  phosphatase-positive bacillus and rahnella spp. strains y9-2 and y9602 liberated  sufficient phosphate to precipitate 73% and 95% of total soluble u added as 200 microm uranyl acetate respectively. in contrast, an arthrobacter sp. x34 exhibiting a phosphatase-negative phenotype did not liberate phosphate from g3p or promote u(vi) precipitation. this study provides the first evidence of u(vi) precipitation via the phosphatase activity of naturally occurring bacillus and rahnella spp. isolated from the acidic subsurface at the doe orfrc.

TI  == atrazine degradation by aerobic microorganisms isolated from the rhizosphere of sweet flag (acorus calamus l.).
AB  == in presented study the capability of microorganisms isolated from the rhizosphere of sweet flag (acorus calamus) to the atrazine degradation was assessed. following isolation of the microorganisms counts of psychrophilic bacteria, mesophilic bacteria and fungi were determined. isolated microorganisms were screened in terms of their ability to decompose a triazine herbicide, atrazine. our results demonstrate that within the rhizosphere of sweet flag there were 3.8x10(7) cfu of psychrophilic bacteria, 1.8x10(7) cfu of mesophilic bacteria, and 6x10(5) cfu of fungi per 1 g of dry root mass. these microorganisms were represented by more than 20 different strains, and at the first step these strains were grown for 5 days in the presence of atrazine at a concentration of 5 mg/l. in terms of the effect of this trial culture, the bacteria reduced the level of atrazine by an average of about 2-20%, but the average level of reduction by fungi was in the range 18-60%. the most active strains involved in atrazine reduction were then selected and identified. these strains were classified as stenotrophomonas maltophilia, bacillus licheniformis, bacillus megaterium, rahnella aquatilis (three strains), umbelopsis isabellina, volutella  ciliata and botrytis cinerea. culturing of the microorganisms for a longer time resulted in high atrazine degradation level. the highest degradation level was observed at atrazine concentrations of 5 mg/l for s. maltophilia (83.5% after 15  days of culture) and for botrytis sp. (82% after 21 days of culture). our results indicate that microorganisms of the sweet flag rhizosphere can play an important  role in the bioremediation of atrazine-contaminated sites.

TI  == endobacteria in some ectomycorrhiza of scots pine (pinus sylvestris).
AB  == the diversity of cultivable endobacteria associated with four different ectomycorrhizal morphotypes (suillus flavidus, suillus variegatus, russula paludosa and russula sp.) of scots pine (pinus sylvestris) was analysed by restriction fragment length polymorphism profiling of pcr-amplified rdna intergenic spacer regions and by sequence analyses of 16s rrna genes. ectomycorrhizal root tip surface-sterilization methods were developed and assessed for their efficiencies. bacterial communities from surface-sterilized ectomycorrhizal root tips were different from those of ectomycorrhizal root tips  without surface-sterilization for all the morphotypes studied. endobacteria belonging to the genera pseudomonas, burkholderia and bacillus were isolated from more than one ectomycorrhizal morphotype, whereas species of rahnella, janthinobacterium and rhodococcus were only isolated from the single morphotypes  of s. variegatus, r. paludosa and russula sp., respectively. some of the isolated endobacteria utilized fungal sugars more readily than typical plant sugars in carbon utilization assays.
