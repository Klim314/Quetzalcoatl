TI  == colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic strip test compromising optimised combinations of anti-s. suis capsular polysaccharide polyclonal antibodies for detection of streptococcus suis.
AB  == a rapid diagnosis kit that detects streptococcus suis (s. suis) antigens from urine with an immunochromatographic stripe (ics) test was developed in this study. the ics test was produced using colloidal gold coated with polyclonal antibodies (pabs) against s. suis. the pabs were developed from rabbits immunised with s. suis serotype 2 capsular polysaccharides (cps). development of the pabs was investigated to establish their binding to cps and to determine the maximum sensitivity of two combination antibodies for the ics test. the results of the ics optimisation revealed that the combinations of pab c-n1 and pab c-n2 had the  highest sensitivity to cps. the minimum limitation of ics sensitivity indicated 1.0 x 10(4) colony forming units (cfu) and a cps concentration of 0.05 microg. the assay time for detection of s. suis antigens is less than 15 min, which is suitable for rapid detection. a cross-reactive test was also conducted, and it detected no other bacteria (streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae). the cross-reactivity of other serotypes in s. suis was also investigated, and tests for serotypes of 1, 1/2, 3, 4, 5, 6,  7, 8, 9, 14, and 16 were positive. this study presents the first report of a development of an ics that enables the quantitative detection of streptococcal antigens. the s. suis ics provides several advantages over other methods, including the speed and simplicity of use.

TI  == bacterial infections in pigs experimentally infected with nipah virus.
AB  == nipah virus (niv; paramyxoviridae) caused fatal encephalitis in humans during an  outbreak in malaysia in 1998/1999 after transmission from infected pigs. our previous study demonstrated that the respiratory, lymphatic and central nervous systems are targets for virus replication in experimentally infected pigs. to continue the studies on pathogenesis of niv in swine, six piglets were inoculated oronasally with 2.5 x 10(5) pfu per animal. four pigs developed mild clinical signs, one exudative epidermitis, and one neurologic signs due to suppurative meningoencephalitis, and was euthanized at 11 days post-inoculation (dpi). neutralizing antibodies reached in surviving animals titers around 1280 at 16 dpi. nasal and oro-pharyngeal shedding of the niv was detected between 2 and 17 dpi. virus appeared to be cleared from the tissues of the infected animals by 23  dpi, with low amount of rna detected in submandibular and bronchial lymph nodes of three pigs, and olfactory bulb of one animal. despite the presence of neutralizing antibodies, virus was isolated from serum at 24 dpi, and the viral rna was still detected in serum at 29 dpi. our results indicate slower clearance  of niv from some of the infected pigs. bacteria were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of five niv inoculated animals, with isolation of streptococcus suis and enterococcus faecalis. staphylococcus hyicus was isolated  from the skin lesions of the animal with exudative epidermitis. along with the observed lymphoid depletion in the lymph nodes of all niv-infected animals, and the demonstrated ability of niv to infect porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro, this finding warrants further investigation into a possible niv-induced immunosuppression of the swine host.

TI  == [antibiotics susceptibility of streptococcus and enterococcus: data of onerba network].
AB  == this work was aimed to analyze trends in susceptibility to antibiotics among the  main species of beta-hemolytic streptococci involved in community-acquired infections in human (streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae), or in  animals (streptococcus suis and streptococcus uberis) and also among the main enterocci species, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium. data were recorded since 1996 through the onerba networks. s. pyogenes, as the other beta-hemolytic streptococci studied remained fully susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics. however, susceptibility to macrolides is clearly decreasing in s. pyogenes. in 2002, only 62 to 65% of the strains according to the network considered, were susceptible to erythromycin. a similar trend was observed for s. agalactiae with only 75% of erythromycin susceptibility in 2002, and for both species isolated from animals s. suis and s. uberis, with respectively 35 and 76% of strains susceptible to erythromycin. in enterococci, susceptibility to beta-lactams remained stable between 2000 and 2004. indeed, the susceptibility to aminopenicillins remained high in e. faecalis (about 98%), whereas the proportion of e. faecium isolates susceptible to these antibiotics were lower than 60%. from 1999 to 2004, various studies conducted in french hospitals showed that the vancomycin resistance among enterococci accounted for less than 2%. however, the  recent emergence of glycopeptide resistant enterococci clusters in french hospitals is a matter of concern and emphasizes the need for an ongoing surveillance. such trend in macrolide resistance among s. pyogenes or s. agalactiae should consequently lead to propose other alternatives in case of beta-lactam allergy, and for pharyngitis, to rethink the place of the culture for susceptibility testing.

TI  == identification and composition of the streptococcal and enterococcal flora of tonsils, intestines and faeces of pigs.
AB  == streptococcus suis was the most frequent streptococcus spp. in pig tonsils, followed by the beta-haemolytic porcine 'equisimilis' ecovar of strep. dysgalactiae. the intestinal streptococcal flora was composed of strep. bovis, strep. hyointestinalis and strep. suis. many of these intestinal strep. suis belonged to a beta-glucuronidase-negative biotype which is infrequent in lesions. nearly half of the strains presumptively identified as strep. alactolyticus produced acid from lactose. this species was not found in tonsils and intestines  but was about equally prevalent as strep. hyointestinalis in pig faeces and rectal swabs. other streptococci were rare in this material. enterococci were much less frequently identified than streptococci in tonsils and faeces. in intestinal samples enterococcus faecalis, ent. faecium, ent. hirae and ent. cecorum were most frequently found. in faeces ent. faecium was the most prevalent enterococcus. the characteristics of the less well known species strep. alactolyticus and strep. hyointestinalis are described in detail, and guidelines  for their differentiation from strep. bovis and strep. suis given.

TI  == characterization of antibiotic resistance in streptococcus suis.
AB  == twenty one isolates of streptococcus suis were screened for antibiotic resistance by growth on antibiotic-containing media, by measuring minimum inhibitory concentrations, by hybridization to specific dna and oligonucleotide probes for antibiotic resistance genes, and by pcr. the isolates were from a slaughter house survey of respiratory pathogens in norwegian pigs in 1986. fifteen isolates were  resistant to tetracycline, with mics ranging from 4-128 micrograms/ml. genes coding for the tet o and tet m determinants were detected in eight and five isolates, respectively. genes coding for other gram positive tet determinants, tet k, tet l, and tet p, were not detected. one isolate was constitutive resistant to erythromycin with mic of 128 micrograms/ml. five other isolates carried inducible erythromycin resistance. all these isolates, and five others, were positive in a pcr assay for erythromycin resistance, and hybridized with the erm c and/or erm b probes. no resistance against chloramphenicol (5 micrograms/ml) or rifampin (10 micrograms/ml) could be could be detected, but five isolates were resistant to streptomycin (250 micrograms/ml), four isolates were resistant to kanamycin (10 micrograms/ml), and one isolate was resistant to  fusicic acid (10 micrograms/ml). in mating experiments with enterococcus faecalis jh2-2 as recipient, tetracycline, erythromycin, and kanamycin genes were transferred separately to the recipient strain at a rate of 10(-7) transconjugants/recipient cell.

TI  == bacterial flora of the urinary tract of pigs associated with cystitis and pyelonephritis.
AB  == twenty-three cases of porcine cystitis and pyelonephritis were examined bacteriologically. eubacterium suis was found in 21 cases. the isolation of large numbers of escherichia coli in the upper urinary tract was associated with linear renal scarring. an unidentifiable streptococcus and enterococcus faecalis were isolated from a case of purulent ureteritis, pyelitis and pyelonephritis. the bacterial flora from cases of cystitis and pyelonephritis was different from that isolated from sows with asymptomatic bacteriuria.

TI  == identification and composition of the tonsillar and anal enterococcal and streptococcal flora of dogs and cats.
AB  == enterococcus faecalis was the most frequently isolated enterococcal species from  anal swabs and tonsils of dogs and cats, although in the anal samples from dogs ent. hirae was found almost as often as ent. faecalis. most ent. faecium strains  from dog tonsils differed from those associated with humans and other animals in  that they fermented sorbitol. typical ent. avium as well as atypical ent. avium-like strains were seen in dogs, while the related species ent. raffinosus was associated with cat tonsils. enterococcus cecorum also occurred mainly in cats. certain atypical strains, presumptively identified as ent. cecorum, shared  characteristics with ent. columbae. the most frequent streptococcal species in tonsils of cats and dogs were streptococcus suis and strep. canis. streptococcus  canis and strep. bovis predominated in anal swabs. the canine strep. suis differed from the common porcine strains in fermenting mannitol. forty-seven of the 288 isolates examined could not be identified or related to known species. the characteristics of two groups of these bacteria, provisionally called 'ton 31 group' and 'o7 group' are described.

TI  == culture media for enterococci and group d-streptococci.
AB  == lancefield group d-streptococci are contaminants of various food commodities, especially those of animal origin. they encompass the new genus enterococcus comprising 13 known species and some species of streptococci which have their habitat in the intestine of animals, e.g. streptococcus bovis, suis and equinus.  the serologically based grouping may no longer constitute the best definition for streptococci from the food chain. food hygiene monitoring systems using enterococci as indicators need reliable methods for selective cultivation and identification of marker strains. up to now more than 100 modifications of selective media have been described for isolating streptococci or enterococci from various specimens. the selection of a medium requires either experience or consultation. it depends on the kind of specimen, the method of cultivation (plate count or membrane filter) and whether or not the habitat is heavily contaminated with other organisms. the choice of media is made more difficult as  commercial versions of the same culture medium may vary in recipe and/or performance from producer to producer. therefore, reviewing the literature may help in the choice of medium and confirmation tests. the selectivity and productivity of some commonly used or cited media are reported here, partly based on our own experience: citrate azide tween carbonate agar (catc), kanamycin aesculin azide agar (kaa) and m-enterococcus agar (me) including earlier results  with aesculin bile azide agar (aba), and thallous acetate tetrazolium glucose agar (titg). no medium was completely selective for all group d-streptococci or for all enterococci but some media were highly selective for a single enterococcus species, e.g., for e. faecalis which serves as indicator of human pollution. confirmatory tests must be carried out when experience in the evaluation procedure is limited. selective media for enterococci should be used only after or while checking in parallel their selectivity and productivity against appropriate test organisms.

TI  == hemagglutination activities of group b, c, d, and g streptococci: demonstration of novel sugar-specific cell-binding activities in streptococcus suis.
AB  == a total of 378 streptococcal isolates of lancefield groups b, c, d and g were tested for their ability to hemagglutinate untreated, sialidase-treated, and endo-beta-galactosidase-treated human erythrocytes. of the 43 strains showing positive hemagglutination, 9 were inhibitable with neutral monosaccharides. four  strains were inhibited with galactose and n-acetylgalactosamine, whereas five were inhibited with galactose only. a third, sialic acid-specific adhesion activity was suggested for two additional strains on the basis of their agglutination of native and endo-beta-galactosidase-treated but not sialidase-treated erythrocytes. all the sugar-specific agglutination activities detected were confined to streptococcus suis strains of group d streptococci, whereas streptococci of other groups did not exhibit these types of hemagglutination activities. the adhesins were sensitive to proteases and heat treatment, which indicates that they were proteins. the hemagglutinating isolates of s. suis originated from pig brain and lung, human brain, and the tonsils of healthy pigs. no clear correlation with a particular serotype was observed. these results demonstrate the occurrence of unique sugar-specific adherence activities  in s. suis, an important pig pathogen with occasional human pathogenicity.

TI  == [isolation of group d streptococci in pyelitis cystica of swine].
AB  == a disease was noted among the replacement sows on a pig-breeding complex, exhibiting signs of pyelonephritis, cystitis, and metritis. bacteriologic studies revealed the presence of streptococci. streptococcus typing was carried out by means of biochemical, immunodiffusion, and immunoelectrophoretic investigations.  the isolated strains were shown to belong to group d--str. suis. the treatment of hcl-extracts to d-group streptococci with pepsin considerably raised the value of the respective immunoelectrophoretic method in the process of typing.

TI  == the distribution of isoprenoid quinones in streptococci of serological groups d and n.
AB  == the isoprenoid quinone contents of streptococci of serological groups d and n were investigated. streptococcus faecalis, s. faecalis subsp. liquefaciens and s. faecalis subsp. zymogenes strains contained demethylmenaquinones with nine isoprene units as their major isoprenologues. menaquinones with eight isoprene units predominated in s. faecium subsp. casseliflavus and s. faecium subsp. mobilis whereas menaquinones with nine isoprene units constituted the major components in strains of s. cremoris, s. cremoris subsp. alactosus, s. lactis and s. lactis subsp. diacetylactis. strains of s. avium, s. bovis, s. durans, s. equinus, s. faecium, s. raffinolactis and s. suis contained neither menaquinones  nor ubiquinones. the isoprenoid quinone data correlate well with other kinds of data on these organisms and are of value in the classification of these bacteria.

TI  == teichoic acids of group d streptococci with special reference to strains from pig meningitis (streptococcus suis).
AB  == immunoelectrophoresis revealed in phenol extracts from s. faecalis and s. faecium a mixture of free and lipid-bound teichoic acids, both reactive with group d antisera. in phenol extracts from s. suis only lipid-bound teichoic acid, also reactive with group d antiserum, was seen. this difference probably accounts for  the low yield of group d antigen from s. suis as compared with s. faecalis and s. faecium when heating at ph 2 is used for extraction. when phenol is used good yields are obtained from s. suis as well as from s. faecalis and s. faecium. lipoteichoic acids from s. faecalis and s. faecium have a backbone structure the  same as or similar to that of group a streptococcal teichoic acid. lipoteichoic acid from s. suis has a structure differing from that of s. faecalis and s. faecium, e.g., possibly in the attachment of its glucosyl substituents. precipitation reactions between s. suis lipoteichoic acid and group d antisera were specifically inhibited by glucose. reactions between s. bovis phenol extracts and some group d antisera were also specifically inhibited by glucose, but extracts from s. faecalis and s. faecium were not. this may indicate a monosaccharide glucosyl substituent in teichoic acid from s. suis and s. bovis instead of the di- or trisaccharide previously postulated as the glucosyl substituent in the teichoic acid of s. faecalis.

TI  == streptococcal infection in young pigs. iv. an outbreak of streptococcal meningitis in weaned pigs.
AB  == twenty-eight pigs died in an outbreak of streptococcal meningitis in an east anglian herd. most were 10-14 weeks old. the outbreak lasted from january to april and was finally controlled by antibiotic therapy. a similar number of losses had occurred in the previous year though no diagnosis had then been made.  the causal agent appeared to be a haemolytic streptococcus belonging to group d and provisionally designated streptococcus suis type 2. it is probably identical  with de moor's group r streptococcus which causes a similar disease in the netherlands. it is serologically distinct from streptococcus suis type 1 which causes meningitis in piglets. type 2 infection in pigs appears to be widespread in england and wales and to occur in animals up to the age of at least 14 weeks.  a comparison is drawn between str. suis meningitis in pigs and group b streptococcal meningitis in human infants.
