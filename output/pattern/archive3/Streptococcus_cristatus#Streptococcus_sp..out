heat-stable molecule derived from streptococcus cristatus induces apobec3 expression and inhibits hiv-1 replication.
although most human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) cases worldwide are transmitted through mucosal surfaces, transmission through the oral mucosal surface is a rare event. more than 700 bacterial species have been detected in the oral cavity. despite great efforts to discover oral inhibitors of hiv, little information is available concerning the anti-hiv activity of oral bacterial components. here we show that a molecule from an oral commensal bacterium, streptococcus cristatus cc5a can induce expression of apobec3g (a3g) and apobec3f (a3f) and inhibit hiv-1 replication in thp-1 cells. we show by qrt-pcr that expression levels of a3g and a3f increase in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of a cc5a extract, as does a3g protein levels by western blot assay. in addition, when the human monocytic cell line thp-1 was treated with cc5a extract, the replication of hiv-1 iiib was significantly suppressed compared with iiib replication in untreated thp-1 cells. knock down of a3g expression in thp-1 cells compromised the ability of cc5a to inhibit hiv-1 iiib infectivity. furthermore, supt1 cells infected with virus produced from cc5a extract-treated thp-1 cells replicated virus with a higher g to a hypermutation rate (a known consequence of a3g activity) than virus used from untreated thp-1 cells. this suggests that s. cristatus cc5a contains a molecule that induces a3g/f expression and thereby inhibits hiv replication. these findings might lead to the discovery of a novel anti-hiv/aids therapeutic.
streptococcus cristatus arca interferes with porphyromonas gingivalis pathogenicity in mice.
background and objective: porphyromonas gingivalis has been implicated as one of  the major pathogens in chronic periodontitis, an infectious disease affecting the majority of the adult population. we have previously demonstrated that a surface protein, arginine deiminase (arca), of streptococcus cristatus represses production of p. gingivalis long fimbriae and interrupts the formation of p. gingivalis biofilms in vitro. our in vivo studies have also shown that the distribution of p. gingivalis and s. cristatus in human subgingival plaque is negatively correlated. the objective of this study was to determine if s. cristatus arca inhibits p. gingivalis colonization and attenuates its subsequent pathogenesis in alveolar bone loss in the murine oral cavity. material and methods: a wild-type strain of s. cristatus (cc5a) and its arca knockout mutant (arcae) were used as initial colonizers in the oral cavity of balb/cbyj mice. colonization of p. gingivalis on the existing s. cristatus biofilms was assessed by quantitative pcr, and p. gingivalis-induced alveolar bone loss was measured 6 wk after p. gingivalis infection. results: the presence of s. cristatus cc5a, but not its arca mutant, attenuated p. gingivalis colonization in the murine oral cavity. in addition, p. gingivalis-induced alveolar bone loss was significantly lower in mice initially infected with s. cristatus cc5a than in those infected with the arca mutant. conclusion: this study provides direct evidence that s. cristatus arca has an inhibitory effect on p. gingivalis colonization, which may in turn attenuate the pathogenicity of p. gingivalis.
streptococcus cristatus modulates the fusobacterium nucleatum-induced epithelial  interleukin-8 response through the nuclear factor-kappa b pathway.
background and objective: we previously reported that the interleukin-8 (il-8) response to fusobacterum nucleatum was attenuated in the presence of streptococcus cristatus. here, we further examined the underlying mechanism(s) involved in the modulating effect of s. cristatus by looking specifically at its impact on the nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-kappab) pathway under the toll-like receptor (tlr) signaling background. material and methods: okf6/tert-2 and kb cells were co-cultured with f. nucleatum and s. cristatus, either alone or in combination. secretion of il-8 protein was measured by elisa. the nuclear translocation of nf-kappab was evaluated by confocal microscopy, while dna-binding activity was quantified using transam elisa kits. western blot analysis was performed to determine whether the anti-inflammatory effect of s. cristatus is related to the modulation of the nf-kappab inhibitory protein ikappab-alpha. results: incubation with f. nucleatum significantly enhanced the nuclear translocation of nf-kappab. exposure to s. cristatus alone did not cause detectable nf-kappab translocation and was able to inhibit the f. nucleatum-induced nf-kappab nuclear translocation. the transam assay further confirmed that s. cristatus blocked the nuclear translocation of nf-kappab in response to f. nucleatum stimulation. in contrast to the nearly complete degradation of ikappab-alpha induced by f. nucleatum alone, the presence of s. cristatus stabilized ikappab-alpha. pre-incubation with tlr2 and tlr4 antibodies, however, did not affect the epithelial response to either species alone or in combination. conclusion: the mechanism by which s. cristatus attenuates f. nucleatum-induced proinflammatory responses in oral epithelial cells appears to involve blockade of nf-kappab nuclear translocation at the level of ikappab-alpha degradation.
role of arginine deiminase of streptococcus cristatus in porphyromonas gingivalis colonization.
the ability to attach to a variety of oral surfaces is an important characteristic of porphyromonas gingivalis. previous studies have demonstrated that expression and production of fima, a major subunit protein of the long fimbriae, is required for p. gingivalis colonization. here we report that a surface protein, arginine deiminase (arca) of streptococcus cristatus, represses fima production and inhibits biofilm formation of p. gingivalis. this inhibitory function of arca is also observed in the formation of heterotypic p. gingivalis-streptococcus gordonii biofilms. p. gingivalis is released from streptococcal substrates in the presence of arca, likely due to an inhibition of fima production. this work suggests that arca may have the potential to be a specific antibiofilm agent to fight p. gingivalis infections.
negative correlation of distributions of streptococcus cristatus and porphyromonas gingivalis in subgingival plaque.
porphyromonas gingivalis is one of the major causative agents of adult periodontitis. one of the features of this periodontal pathogen is its ability to attach to a variety of oral bacterial surfaces and to colonize subgingival dental plaque. we have shown that streptococcus cristatus cc5a inhibits expression of fima, a gene encoding the major protein subunit of long fimbriae in p. gingivalis; as a result, s. cristatus interrupts formation of p. gingivalis biofilms. here we further demonstrate that the inhibitory activity of s. cristatus affects multiple strains of p. gingivalis and that optimal inhibitory activity correlates with levels of arginine deiminase expression in s. cristatus. more strikingly, the impact of s. cristatus on p. gingivalis colonization was revealed by comparing levels of p. gingivalis and s. cristatus in subgingival dental plaque. spearman correlation analysis indicated a negative correlation between the distributions of s. cristatus and p. gingivalis (r = -0.57; p < 0.05). these data suggest that some early colonizers of dental plaque, such as s. cristatus, may be beneficial to the host by antagonizing the colonization and accumulation of periodontal pathogens such as p. gingivalis.
role of differential expression of streptococcal arginine deiminase in inhibition of fima expression in porphyromonas gingivalis.
streptococcus cristatus arca inhibits production of a major adhesin, fima, in porphyromonas gingivalis, a primary periodontal pathogen. in this study, we demonstrate the differential expression of arca in two streptococcal species. the expression level of arca in streptococci appears to be controlled by both cis and trans elements.
identification of a signalling molecule involved in bacterial intergeneric communication.
the development of complex multispecies communities such as biofilms is controlled by interbacterial communication systems. we have previously reported an intergeneric communication between two oral bacteria, streptococcus cristatus and porphyromonas gingivalis, that results in inhibition of fima expression. here, we demonstrate that a surface protein, arginine deiminase (arca), of s. cristatus serves as a signal that initiates intergeneric communication. an arca-deficient mutant of s. cristatus is unable to communicate with p. gingivalis. furthermore, arginase activity is not essential for the communication, and arca retains the ability to repress expression of fima in the presence of arginine deiminase inhibitors. these results present a novel mechanism by which intergeneric communication in dental biofilms is accomplished.
fusobacterium nucleatum transports noninvasive streptococcus cristatus into human epithelial cells.
analysis of human buccal epithelial cells frequently reveals an intracellular polymicrobial consortium of bacteria. although several oral bacteria have been demonstrated to invade cultured epithelial cells, several others appear unable to internalize. we hypothesized that normally noninvasive bacteria may gain entry into epithelial cells via adhesion to invasive bacteria. fusobacterium nucleatum is capable of binding to and invading oral epithelial cells. by contrast, streptococcus cristatus binds weakly to host cells and is not internalized. f. nucleatum and s. cristatus coaggregate strongly via an arginine-sensitive interaction. coincubation of kb or tert-2 epithelial cells with equal numbers of f. nucleatum and s. cristatus bacteria led to significantly increased numbers of adherent and internalized streptococci. f. nucleatum also promoted invasion of kb cells by other oral streptococci and actinomyces naeslundii. dissection of fusobacterial or streptococcal adhesive interactions by using sugars, amino acids, or antibodies demonstrated that this phenomenon is due to direct attachment of s. cristatus to adherent and invading f. nucleatum. inhibition of f. nucleatum host cell attachment and invasion with galactose, or fusobacterial-streptococcal coaggregation by the arginine homologue l-canavanine, abrogated the increased s. cristatus adhesion to, and invasion of, host cells. in addition, polyclonal antibodies to f. nucleatum, which inhibited fusobacterial attachment to both kb cells and s. cristatus, significantly decreased invasion by both species. similar decreases were obtained when epithelial cells were pretreated with cytochalasin d, staurosporine, or cycloheximide. these studies indicate that f. nucleatum may facilitate the colonization of epithelial cells by bacteria unable to adhere or invade directly.
porphyromonas gingivalis genes involved in fima regulation.
porphyromonas gingivalis is an important component of the complex plaque biofilm  that is a direct precursor of periodontal disease. the major fimbriae are required for attachment to oral surfaces and are an important virulence factor. fimbrillin (fima) expression in p. gingivalis is inhibited by surface molecule of streptococcus cristatus, an early colonizer of dental plaque. in this study, differential display pcr was used to identify p. gingivalis genes that are regulated in response to s. cristatus. of several differentially expressed genes, pg2131 and pg2167 were upregulated by s. cristatus signaling molecules. a null mutant of pg2167 did not transcriptionally regulate fima following exposure to s. cristatus. in fact, fima transcription was enhanced in the pg2167 mutant, suggesting that pg2167 may act to repress fima expression. in contrast, a mutation in pg2131 did not affect transcription of fima in the presence of s. cristatus. however, production of fimbrillin was significantly diminished in the pg2131 mutant, implicating involvement in posttranscriptional regulation in fimbriation. these data suggest that p. gingivalis fimbriation is controlled by more than one regulation mechanism, involving both transcriptional and posttranscriptional processes.
