TI  - Phenotypic Characteristics and Probiotic Potentials of Lactobacillus spp. Isolated From Poultry.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactic acid bacteria, especially Lactobacillus spp., have been considered as excellent probiotic microorganisms, because of their activities in reducing the enteric diseases and maintaining healthy poultry. OBJECTIVES: The current study aimed to evaluate the phenotypic characteristics and the probiotic potentials of Lactobacillus spp. isolated from poultry. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 168 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from healthy six and twenty-one-day old chickens and their feed samples. The isolated bacteria were identified by morphological, biochemical, and molecular tests including Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Biochemical fingerprinting with Phene Plate system (Ph-P) was done and the acid and bile resistant lactobacilli were subjected to the antibiotic susceptibility test. RESULTS: Amongst all of the examined LAB, 30.3% were resistant to bile and acid. Most of the isolated LAB (57.1%) belonged to the genus Lactobacillus with Lactobacillus brevis (78.1%) as the dominant species followed by L. reuteri (16.6%), L. plantarum (3%), and L. vaginalis (2%). The remaining isolates were identified as Pediococcus spp. (42.9%). The Ph-P cluster analysis of 75 L. brevis and 16 L. reuteri strains showed high phenotypic diversity. Whilst the results of Ph-P typing from L. reuteri strains showed low phenotypic variations especially among the strains sensitive to acid and bile salts. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the results showed that some of the high potential probiotic LAB species existed in Iranian poultry.
TI  - Inhibitory activity in vitro of probiotic lactobacilli against oral Candida under different fermentation conditions.
AB  - Clinical studies have shown that probiotics positively affect oral health by decreasing gum bleeding and/or reducing salivary counts of certain oral pathogens. Our aim was to investigate the inhibitory effect of six probiotic lactobacilli against opportunistic oral Candida species. Sugar utilisation by both lactobacilli and Candida was also assessed. Agar overlay assay was utilised to study growth inhibition of Candida albicans, Candida glabrata and Candida krusei by Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus casei Shirota, Lactobacillus reuteri SD2112, Lactobacillus brevis CD2, Lactobacillus bulgaricus LB86 and L. bulgaricus LB Lact. The inhibitory effect was measured at pH 5.5, 6.4, and 7.2, respectively, and in the presence of five different carbohydrates in growth medium (glucose, fructose, lactose, sucrose, and sorbitol). Growth and final pH values were measured at two-hour time points to 24 h. L. rhamnosus GG showed the strongest inhibitory activity in fructose and glucose medium against C. albicans, followed by L. casei Shirota, L. reuteri SD2112 and L. brevis CD2. None of the lactobacilli tested affected the growth of C. krusei. Only L. rhamnosus GG produced slight inhibitory effect on C. glabrata. The lower pH values led to larger inhibition zones. Sugar fermentation profiles varied between the strains. L. casei Shirota grew in the presence of all sugars tested, whereas L. brevis CD2 could utilise only glucose and fructose. All Candida species metabolised the available sugars but the most rapid growth was observed with C. glabrata. The results suggest that commercially available probiotics differ in their inhibitory activity and carbohydrate utilisation; the above properties are modified by different pH values and sugars with more pronounced inhibition at lower pH.
TI  - Antimicrobial and anti-adhesive properties of biosurfactant produced by lactobacilli isolates, biofilm formation and aggregation ability.
AB  - This study aimed to investigate the antimicrobial and anti-adhesive properties of biosurfactant extracted from ten lactobacilli species isolated from Egyptian dairy products. The produced biosurfactants showed distinct antimicrobial and anti-adhesive activities against several pathogenic microorganisms. Furthermore, lactobacilli isolates were studied for biofilm formation and lactic acid production in different growth media. All lactobacilli isolates produced biofilm on polystyrene surface in all media tested to different degrees. L. acidophilus showed the highest biofilm formation in Rogosa medium. However, the highest lactic acid production was recorded by L. brevis (39.63 g/L), followed by L. reuteri (33.32 g/L) in MRS medium. Evaluation based on in vitro studies including auto-aggregation and co-aggregation with three pathogenic bacterial strains was further analyzed. All lactobacilli isolates tested were able to auto-aggregate (ranging from 51.12% to 78.17% assessed at 5 h of incubation). The lactobacilli isolates co-aggregate with the tested bacterial strains to different degrees; among them L. delbrueckii showed the highest scores of co-aggregation with Candida albicans ATC70014, reaching 59.37%. The aggregation ability exhibited by the isolated lactobacilli, together with the antimicrobial and anti-adhesive properties observed for their biosurfactants, opens future prospects for their use against microorganisms responsible for diseases and infections and as effective probiotic strains.
TI  - Molecular identification of Lactobacillus spp. associated with puba, a Brazilian  fermented cassava food.
AB  - Puba or carima is a Brazilian staple food obtained by spontaneous submerged fermentation of cassava roots. A total of 116 lactobacilli and three cocci isolates from 20 commercial puba samples were recovered on de Man, Rogosa and Sharpe agar (MRS); they were characterized for their antagonistic activity against foodborne pathogens and identified taxonomically by classical and molecular methods. In all samples, lactic acid bacteria were recovered as the dominant microbiota (7.86 +/- 0.41 log10 CFU/g). 16S-23S rRNA ARDRA pattern assigned 116 isolates to the Lactobacillus genus, represented by the species Lactobacillus fermentum (59 isolates), Lactobacillus delbrueckii (18 isolates), Lactobacillus casei (9 isolates), Lactobacillus reuteri (6 isolates), Lactobacillus brevis (3 isolates), Lactobacillus gasseri (2 isolates), Lactobacillus nagelii (1 isolate), and Lactobacillus plantarum group (18 isolates). recA gene-multiplex PCR analysis revealed that L. plantarum group isolates belonged to Lactobacillus plantarum (15 isolates) and Lactobacillus paraplantarum (3 isolates). Genomic diversity was investigated by molecular typing with rep (repetitive sequence)-based PCR using the primer ERIC2 (enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus). The Lactobacillus isolates exhibited genetic heterogeneity and species-specific fingerprint patterns. All the isolates showed antagonistic activity against the foodborne pathogenic bacteria tested. This antibacterial effect was attributed to acid production, except in the cases of three isolates that apparently produced bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances. This study provides the first insight into the genetic diversity of Lactobacillus spp. of puba.
TI  - Species-specific quantification of probiotic lactobacilli in yoghurt by quantitative real-time PCR.
AB  - AIMS: Lactobacilli strains with probiotic effects have been widely used in dairy  products such as yoghurts as well as in food additives and pharmaceuticals. Despite their successful commercial application, the current species identification and quantification methods of the genus Lactobacillus are time-consuming and labour-intensive. METHODS AND RESULTS: To fulfil the requirements of a robust quality management, we have developed a quantitative real-time PCR assay based on the heat shock protein 60 gene (hsp60) for accurate identification and quantification of five commercially important Lactobacillus species. The developed assay allows an unambiguous species-specific detection of the species Lact. acidophilus, Lact. brevis, Lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lact. helveticus and Lact. reuteri from bacterial cultures as well as directly from dairy products for instance yoghurt. CONCLUSIONS: With the assay, we were able to specifically detect lactobacilli strains down to 10(5) CFU ml(-1) directly from yoghurt, which is a sufficient detection limit as commercial products usually contain 10(6) -10(12) CFU ml(-1) of probiotic strains. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The real-time PCR assay developed here might become a convenient tool enabling an accurate, fast and sensitive detection of probiotic lactobacilli commercially used in food.
TI  - Lactobacillus species isolated from vaginal secretions of healthy and bacterial vaginosis-intermediate Mexican women: a prospective study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactobacillus jensenii, L. iners, L. crispatus and L. gasseri are the most frequently occurring lactobacilli in the vagina. However, the native species vary widely according to the studied population. The present study was performed to genetically determine the identity of Lactobacillus strains present in the vaginal discharge of healthy and bacterial vaginosis (BV) intermediate Mexican women. METHODS: In a prospective study, 31 strains preliminarily identified as Lactobacillus species were isolated from 21 samples collected from 105 non-pregnant Mexican women. The samples were classified into groups according to the Nugent score criteria proposed for detection of BV: normal (N), intermediate (I) and bacterial vaginosis (BV). We examined the isolates using culture-based methods as well as molecular analysis of the V1-V3 regions of the 16S rRNA gene. Enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) sequence analysis was performed to reject clones. RESULTS: Clinical isolates (25/31) were classified into four groups based on sequencing and analysis of the 16S rRNA gene: L. acidophilus (14/25), L. reuteri (6/25), L. casei (4/25) and L. buchneri (1/25). The remaining six isolates were presumptively identified as Enterococcus species. Within the L. acidophilus group, L. gasseri was the most frequently isolated species, followed by L. jensenii and L. crispatus. L. fermentum, L. rhamnosus and L. brevis were also isolated, and were placed in the L. reuteri, L. casei and L. buchneri groups, respectively. ERIC profile analysis showed intraspecific variability amongst the L. gasseri and L. fermentum species. CONCLUSIONS: These findings agree with previous studies showing that L. crispatus, L. gasseri and L. jensenii are consistently present in the healthy vaginal ecosystem. Additional species or phylotypes were detected in the vaginal microbiota of the non-pregnant Mexican (Hispanic-mestizo) population, and thus, these results further our understanding of vaginal lactobacilli colonisation and richness in this particular population.
TI  - Qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of Lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy fertile and postmenopausal Chinese women.
AB  - The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and quantity of Lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy Chinese women. Vaginal samples from 92 fertile and 22 postmenopausal healthy Chinese women were analysed using a 16S rRNA gene clone library and species-specific PCR followed by sequencing and real-time PCR. A total of 13 different Lactobacillus species were detected. Species-specific PCR showed that 3% of the fertile women were colonized by one species of Lactobacillus and 97% were colonized by two or more species. Among the postmenopausal women, 91% were colonized by one species of Lactobacillus and 9% were colonized by two species. In the fertile women, L. iners (82.61%), L. crispatus (70.65%) and L. gasseri (67.39%) were more prevalent than L. jensenii (40.22%), L. acidophilus (39.13%), L. brevis (23.91%), L. plantarum (5.43%), L. johnsonii (3.26%), L. fermentum (2.17%), L. salivarius (2.17%), L. rhamnosus (1.09%), L. reuteri (1.09%) and L. paracasei (1.09%); L. delbrueckii was not detected. In the postmenopausal women, L. fermentum, L. rhamnosus, L. reuteri and L. delbrueckii were not detected, and the other 10 species were detected in just a few samples. The prevalence of these species according to the clone library differed from the prevalence indicated by the species-specific PCR. According to the semiquantitative analysis, the total Lactobacillus DNA concentrations were higher in fertile women than in postmenopausal women. Sixty-one per cent of the fertile women were predominantly colonized by L. iners, 35% by L. crispatus, and 2% by L. gasseri. Associations between pairs of Lactobacillus species in fertile women were significant (P<0.05) between the following pairs: L. iners and L. gasseri, L. iners and L. jensenii, L. iners and L. acidophilus, L. gasseri and L. acidophilus, and L. gasseri and L. jensenii. In conclusion, this study provided detailed information on Lactobacillus species colonizing the vaginas of healthy Chinese fertile and postmenopausal women. The study also showed that the diversity of Lactobacillus species in fertile women was higher than in postmenopausal women. According to our study, different techniques, such as species-specific PCR and comparison against a 16S rRNA gene clone library, resulted in different findings regarding species prevalence. These findings highlight the importance of standardization of techniques used for evaluation of bacterial communities. According to our findings regarding species associations, L. iners and L. gasseri may have influences on colonization and proliferation of other vaginal Lactobacillus species.
TI  - Discrimination of probiotic Lactobacillus strains for poultry by repetitive sequenced-based PCR fingerprinting.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Four repetitive element sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (rep-PCR) methods, namely repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR (REP-PCR), enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus PCR (ERIC-PCR), polytrinucleotide (GTG)5 -PCR and BOX-PCR, were evaluated for the molecular differentiation of 12 probiotic Lactobacillus strains previously isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of chickens and used as a multistrain probiotic. This study represents the first analysis of the comparative efficacy of these four rep-PCR methods and their combination (composite rep-PCR) in the molecular typing of Lactobacillus strains based on a discriminatory index (D). RESULTS: Species-specific and strain-specific profiles were observed from rep-PCR. From the numerical analysis of composite rep-PCR, BOX-PCR, (GTG)5 -PCR, REP-PCR and ERIC-PCR, D values of 0.9118, 0.9044, 0.8897, 0.8750 and 0.8529 respectively were obtained. Composite rep-PCR analysis was the most discriminative method, with eight Lactobacillus strains, namely L. brevis ATCC 14869(T) , L. reuteri C 10, L. reuteri ATCC 23272(T) , L. gallinarum ATCC 33199(T) , L. salivarius ATCC 11741(T) , L. salivarius I 24, L. panis JCM 11053(T) and L. panis C 17, being differentiated at the strain level. CONCLUSION: Composite rep-PCR analysis is potentially a useful fingerprinting method to discriminate probiotic Lactobacillus strains isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of chickens.
TI  - Phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of lactic acid bacteria isolated from sour congee in Inner Mongolia of China.
AB  - Sour congee is a popular food in the western regions of Inner Mongolia in China.  It has a complex microbial population, which contributes to its unique flavor and functional properties. In this study, we chose 28 sour congee samples that were collected from different areas in Inner Mongolia for analysis of the microbial community of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) by classical biochemical tests, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, multiplex PCR assay of recA gene and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the tuf gene (encoding elongation factor Tu). The results revealed that all the isolates were identified as Lactobacillus (L.) paracasei (38 strains), L. fermentum (28 strains), L. plantarum (7 strains), L. brevis (4 strains), L. reuteri (2 strains), L. amylolyticus (1 strain), Enterococcus (E.) faecalis (3 strains), E. italicus (2 strains) or Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (1 strain). The predominant LAB were L. casei and L. fermentum in sour congee samples. The diversity of LAB derived from sour congee could offer useful information for further research on sour congee, and the results demonstrated that the combination of tuf gene and RFLP patterns can be considered as a useful tool for differentiation of the L. casei group.
TI  - An in vitro protocol for direct isolation of potential probiotic lactobacilli from raw bovine milk and traditional fermented milks.
AB  - A method for isolating potential probiotic lactobacilli directly from traditional milk-based foods was developed. The novel digestion/enrichment protocol was set up taking care to minimize the protective effect of milk proteins and fats and was validated testing three commercial fermented milks containing well-known probiotic Lactobacillus strains. Only probiotic bacteria claimed in the label were isolated from two out of three commercial fermented milks. The application of the new protocol to 15 raw milk samples and 6 traditional fermented milk samples made it feasible to isolate 11 potential probiotic Lactobacillus strains belonging to Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus johnsonii, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus reuteri, and Lactobacillus vaginalis species. Even though further analyses need to ascertain functional properties of these lactobacilli, the novel protocol set-up makes it feasible to isolate quickly potential probiotic strains from traditional milk-based foods reducing the amount of time required by traditional procedures that, in addition, do not allow to isolate microorganisms occurring as sub-dominant populations.
TI  - Phylogenomic reconstruction of lactic acid bacteria: an update.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. However, the phylogenetic relationships among LAB species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. RESULTS: We performed a phylogenetic analysis of LAB species based on 232 genes from 28 LAB genome sequences. Regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. The LAB species examined were divided into two groups. Group 1 included families Enterococcaceae and Streptococcaceae. Group 2 included families Lactobacillaceae and Leuconostocaceae. Within Group 2, the LAB species were divided into two clades. One clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus Lactobacillus and two other species, Lb. sakei and Lb. casei. In the acidophilus complex, Lb. delbrueckii separated first, while Lb. acidophilus/Lb. helveticus and Lb. gasseri/Lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. The other clade within Group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, Lb. salivarius, Lb. plantarum, Lb. brevis, Lb. reuteri, Lb. fermentum, and the genera Pediococcus, Oenococcus, and Leuconostoc. In this clade, Lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to Lb. plantarum/Lb. brevis pair and Pediococcus, and the other including Oenococcus/Leuconostoc pair and Lb. reuteri/Lb. fermentum pair. In addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be more useful than others. The genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (TRSB), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein B (uvrB), DNA polymerase III (polC) and penicillin binding protein 2B (pbpB). CONCLUSIONS: Our phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of LAB species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. We infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in LAB species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. Further analyses of more genes from additional, representative LAB species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of LAB species to various environmental niches.
TI  - Protective effect of Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota against lethal infection  with multi-drug resistant Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium DT104 in mice.
AB  - AIMS: The anti-infectious activity of lactobacilli against multi-drug resistant Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium DT104 (DT104) was examined in a murine model of an opportunistic antibiotic-induced infection. METHODS AND RESULTS: Explosive intestinal growth and subsequent lethal extra-intestinal translocation after oral infection with DT104 during fosfomycin (FOM) administration was significantly inhibited by continuous oral administration of Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota (LcS), which is naturally resistant to FOM, at a dose of 10(8) colony-forming units per mouse daily to mice. Comparison of the anti-Salmonella activity of several Lactobacillus type strains with natural resistance to FOM revealed that Lactobacillus brevis ATCC 14869(T) , Lactobacillus plantarum ATCC 14917(T) , Lactobacillus reuteri JCM 1112(T) , Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 7469(T) and Lactobacillus salivarius ATCC 11741(T) conferred no activity even when they obtained the high population levels almost similar to those of the effective strains such as LcS, Lact. casei ATCC 334(T) and Lactobacillus zeae ATCC 15820(T) . The increase in concentration of organic acids and maintenance of the lower pH in the intestine because of Lactobacillus colonization were correlated with the anti-infectious activity. Moreover, heat-killed LcS was not protective against the infection, suggesting that the metabolic activity of lactobacilli is important for the anti-infectious activity. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that certain lactobacilli in combination with antibiotics may be useful for prophylaxis against opportunistic intestinal infections by multi-drug resistant pathogens, such as DT104. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Antibiotics such as FOM disrupt the metabolic activity of the intestinal microbiota that produce organic acids, and that only probiotic strains that are metabolically active in vivo should be selected to prevent intestinal infection when used clinically in combination with certain antibiotics.
TI  - Diversity of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium in feces of herbivores, omnivores  and carnivores.
AB  - The Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium population in the feces of 26 animals (16 species) were studied by culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. Lactobacilli were detected from a few herbivores, all carnivores and some omnivores. Lactobacillus johnsonii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus vaginalis and Lactobacillus ingluviei were the most dominant lactobacilli in carnivores. These species were, however, not predominant in herbivores and omnivores. Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus parabuchneri, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus sakei, Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, usually present in raw plant material, were present in omnivores but not in carnivores. Bifidobacteria were detected in only four herbivores and two omnivores. Bifidobacterium pseudolongum was the only Bifidobacterium species detected in herbivores. Bifidobacteria detected in the two omnivores are phylogenetically not closely related to known species and are possible novel species in the genus.
TI  - Analysis of the Lactobacillus metabolic pathway.
AB  - We performed analyses of the phenotypic and genotypic relationships focusing on biosyntheses of amino acids, purine/pyrimidines, and cofactors in three Lactobacillus strains. We found that Lactobacillus fermentum IFO 3956 perhaps synthesized para-aminobenzoate (PABA), an intermediate of folic acid biosynthesis, by an alternative pathway.
TI  - A ready-to-use antifungal starter culture improves the shelf life of packaged bread.
AB  - Fungal spoilage is the main cause of economic loss in the baking industry. In this study, we developed a ready-to-use biopreserver (slurry [SL]) for nonsliced packed bread by using selected antifungal lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and low-cost ingredients that are compatible with the food matrix. Four LAB strains (Lactobacillus brevis CRL 772, L. brevis CRL 796, L. plantarum CRL 778, and L. reuteri CRL 1100) tested in bread preservation were able to inhibit Penicillium sp. growth and lengthen shelf life twofold with respect to breads prepared using only Saccharomyces cerevisiae (2 days shelf life). The best biopreservation effect (5 days shelf life) was obtained with 40% antifungal slurry SL778 containing L. plantarum CRL 778; this was as effective as 0.2% calcium propionate (PCa). The antifungal effect of SL778 was related to the synthesis of acetic and phenyllactic acid as well as lactic acid, which was produced at a high concentration (31.2 mmol/kg) and lowered the pH of the dough, favoring the undissociated fraction of the organic acids. The combination of the starter SL778 with 0.4% PCa extended the shelf life of packaged bread to 24 days, 2.6-fold longer than breads prepared with only 0.4% PCa.
TI  - Bile salt deconjugation and cholesterol removal from media by Lactobacillus strains used as probiotics in chickens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bile salt deconjugation by Lactobacillus strains is often closely linked to bile tolerance and survival of the strains in the gut and lowering of cholesterol in the host. The present study investigated the deconjugation of bile salts and removal of cholesterol by 12 Lactobacillus strains in vitro. The 12 strains were previously isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of chickens. RESULTS: The 12 Lactobacillus strains could deconjugate sodium glycocholate (GCA, 16.87-100%) and sodium taurocholate (TCA, 1.69-57.43%) bile salts to varying degrees, with all strains except L. salivarius I 24 having a higher affinity for GCA. The 12 Lactobacillus strains also showed significant (P < 0.05) differences in their ability to remove cholesterol from the growth medium (26.74-85.41%). Significant (P < 0.05) correlations were observed between cholesterol removal and deconjugation of TCA (r = 0.83) among the L. reuteri strains (C1, C10 and C16) and between cholesterol removal and deconjugation of TCA (r = 0.38) and GCA (r = 0.70) among the L. brevis strains (I 12, I 23, I 25, I 211 and I 218). In contrast, although L. gallinarum I 16 and I 26 and L. panis C 17 showed high deconjugating activity, there was no correlation between cholesterol removal and deconjugation of bile salts in these strains. CONCLUSION: The results showed that the 12 Lactobacillus strains were able to deconjugate bile salts and remove cholesterol in vitro, but not all strains with high deconjugating activity removed cholesterol effectively.
TI  - Influence of environmental parameters on production of the acrolein precursor 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde by Lactobacillus reuteri DSMZ 20016 and its accumulation by wine lactobacilli.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria belonging to the genus Lactobacillus are known to convert glycerol into 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-HPA) during anaerobic glycerol fermentation. Wine quality can be gravely compromised by the accumulation of 3-HPA, due to its spontaneous conversion to acrolein under wine making conditions. Acrolein is not only a dangerous substance for the living cell, but has been implicated in the development of unpleasant bitterness in beverages. This study evaluates the effect of individual environmental parameters on 3-HPA production by Lactobacillus reuteri DSMZ 20016, which only proved possible under conditions that allow accumulation well below the threshold concentration affecting cell viability. 3-HPA production was optimal at pH 6 and in the presence of 300 mM glycerol. Production increased with an increase in cell concentration up to an OD(600) of 50, whereas higher cell concentrations inhibited accumulation. Data presented in this study suggest that 3-HPA plays a role in regulating its own production through quorum sensing. Glycerol dehydratase possessing bacterial strains isolated from South African red wine, L. pentosus and L. brevis, tested positive for 3-HPA accumulation. 3-HPA is normally intracellularly reduced to 1,3-propanediol. This is the first study demonstrating the ability of wine lactobacilli to accumulate 3-HPA in the fermentation media. Recommendations are made on preventing the formation of acrolein and its precursor 3-HPA in wine.
TI  - Isolation of lactobacilli from sow milk and evaluation of their probiotic potential.
AB  - Sow milk protects the piglet against infectious diseases through a variety of mechanisms. In this study, the presence of potentially probiotic lactic acid bacteria in this biological fluid was investigated. Milk samples were obtained from 8 sows and a total of 19 rod-shaped isolates were selected for identification and assessment of their probiotic potential. RAPD profiling revealed the existence of 8 different genetic profiles among them. One representative of each profile was selected for further characterization and they were identified as Lactobacillus reuteri, Lb. salivarius, Lb. plantarum, Lb. paraplantarum, Lb. brevis and Weissella paramesenteroides. Then, their probiotic potential was evaluated through different assays, including survival in conditions simulating those existing in the gastrointestinal tract, production of antimicrobial compounds, adherence to intestinal mucin, production of biogenic amines, degradation of mucin, and pattern of antibiotic sensitivity. Three strains, Lb. reuteri CR20 (a reuterin-producing strain), Lb. salivarius CELA2 (a bacteriocin-producing strain) and Lb. paraplantarum CLB7 displayed the highest probiotic potential.
TI  - Estimation of 16S rRNA gene copy number in several probiotic Lactobacillus strains isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of chicken.
AB  - The copy numbers of 16S rRNA genes in 12 probiotic Lactobacillus strains of poultry origin were analyzed. Genomic DNA of the strains was digested with restriction endonucleases that do not cut within the 16S rRNA gene of the strains. This was followed by Southern hybridization with a biotinylated probe complementary to the 16S rRNA gene. The copy number of the 16S rRNA gene within a Lactobacillus species was found to be conserved. From the hybridization results, Lactobacillus salivarius I 24 was estimated to have seven copies of the 16S rRNA gene, Lactobacillus panis C 17 to have five copies and Lactobacillus gallinarum strains I 16 and I 26 four copies. The 16S rRNA gene copy numbers of L. gallinarum and L. panis reported in the present study are the first record. Lactobacillus brevis strains I 12, I 23, I 25, I 211, I 218 and Lactobacillus reuteri strains C 1, C 10, C 16 were estimated to have at least four copies of the 16S rRNA gene. In addition, distinct rRNA restriction patterns which could discriminate the strains of L. reuteri and L. gallinarum were also detected. Information on 16S rRNA gene copy number is important for physiological, evolutionary and population studies of the bacteria.
TI  - Rapid identification of the three major species of dairy obligate heterofermenters Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus parabuchneri by species-specific duplex PCR.
AB  - In this study, the biodiversity of 154 strains of lactic acid bacteria, including 112 dairy product isolates presumptively identified as obligately heterofermentative lactobacilli (OHL) by classical microbiological tests, as well as 23 OHL-type strains, was investigated by PCR-based methods and gene sequencing. Using these techniques, 51% of the cheese isolates were actually identified as OHL. The non-OHL isolates were identified to the Leuconostoc, Lactobacillus, Weisella, Pediococcus or Streptococcus genera. Among the OHL cheese isolates, five species were directly identified including three of the most frequently isolated species -Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus parabuchneri and Lactobacillus brevis- and two rarely isolated species - Lactobacillus diolivorans and Lactobacillus reuteri. A sixth group made up of two dairy isolates was also identified and according to 16S rRNA gene and intergenic spacer region (ISR) sequencing data corresponded to Lactobacillus sp. and may constitute a new species. Species-specific primers were designed for the rapid and reliable detection of the three most frequently isolated species by species-specific duplex PCR.
TI  - A differential medium for lactic acid-producing bacteria in a mixed culture.
AB  - AIMS: Modified deMan-Rogosa Sharpe agar containing bromophenol blue (mMRS-BPB) was tested as a medium for counting and differentiation of each lactic acid-producing bacterium (LAB), especially in a mixed culture. METHODS AND RESULTS: Type strains of 10 LAB species (Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. brevis, L. bulgaricus, L. gasseri, L. paracasei, L. plantarum, L. reuteri, Weissella confusa, Bifidobacterium bifidum and B. infantis) and five commercial yogurts were inoculated on plate count agar with bromocresol purple, mMRS, and mMRS-BPB. Each type strain showed more clearly formed colonies on the three media under anaerobic conditions than under aerobic conditions. Especially each type strain produced colonies with specific characteristics of each species on mMRS-BPB. Commercial yogurts produced the largest number of colonies with various shapes and colours on mMRS-BPB. CONCLUSIONS: Modified deMan-Rogosa Sharpe agar containing bromophenol blue under anaerobic conditions is appropriate for counting and differentiating each LAB in a mixed culture. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Modified deMan-Rogosa Sharpe agar containing bromophenol blue will be useful in isolation and enumeration of each LAB from fermented foods as well as intestinal microflora.
TI  - Analysis of vaginal lactic acid producing bacteria in healthy women.
AB  - Vaginal lactic acid-producing bacteria of 80 pre-menopausal women were studied by isolation on Blood and DeMan-Rogosa-Sharpe agar, PCR with group-specific primers for Lactobacillus-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), and PCR with specific primers for V3 region in 16S rRNA-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (TTGE). Conventional isolation method on media detected only one lactobacillus (Lactobacillus brevis) while TTGE detected only Lactobacillus sp. DGGE detected seven Lactobacillus species; L. coleohominis, L. crispatus, L. iners, L. reuteri, L. rhamnosus, L. vaginalis, and Leuconostoc lactis. L. acidophilus and L. gasseri, which are prevalent in Western women, were not detected in Korean women. Furthermore, L. rhamnosus, Leuc. lactis, L. coleohominis, and Weissella cibaria, which were not previously reported in the vaginal microbiota of Korean women, were detected. The five most prevalent LABs in vaginal microbiota in Korean women were L. iners, Enterococcus faecalis, L. crispatus, Leuc. lactis, and W. cibaria.
TI  - Isolation and molecular characterization of antibiotic-resistant lactic acid bacteria from poultry and swine meat products.
AB  - The transfer via the food chain from animals to humans of microbes that are resistant to antimicrobial agents is of increasing concern. To determine the contributions of nonpathogenic microflora to the occurrence and spread of antibiotic resistance (AR) genes in the food chain, 123 lactic acid bacteria were isolated from 29 samples of raw and processed pork and chicken meat products that had previously tested positive for one or more AR genes that encode clinically relevant ARs: tet(M), tet(O), tet(K), erm(A), erm(B), erm(C), aac (6')-Ie aph (2")-Ia, mecA, and blaZ. All of the isolates were initially tested for their AR gene profiles by PCR. The 59 isolates carrying a tet, erm, or blaZ gene were taken through molecular identification, analyzed by determination of the MIC, and subjected to genetic fingerprinting. Lactococcus garvieae was the predominant species (28 isolates), followed by Lactobacillus plantarum (11 isolates) and L. salivarius (6 isolates), whereas Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Lactobacillus johnsonii, L. reuteri, L. crispatus, and L. brevis were identified at lower frequencies. The tet(M) and erm(B) genes were the most frequently detected. Assessment of multiple resistances in 18 tet positive (tet+) isolates revealed that tet(M) plus erm(B) and tet(K) plus erm(B) were the most frequent AR gene patterns. Partial sequencing of the tet(M) open reading frame of three selected strains showed high sequence similarities (> 99%) with tet(M) genes previously found in human pathogens (Listeria monocytogenes and Neisseria meningitidis). Southern hybridization with plasmid profiles revealed these strains contained tet(M)-carrying plasmids.
TI  - Culture-independent analysis of the microbial composition of the African traditional fermented foods poto poto and degue by using three different DNA extraction methods.
AB  - The microbial composition of the traditional fermented foods poto poto (a maize dough from the Rep. of Congo) and degue (a millet dough from Burkina Faso) was studied by a culture-independent approach using TTGE to separate the amplified target V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene from total microbial community, followed by DNA sequencing and homology search. Three different extraction methods were used. Guanidium thiocyanate-based DNA extraction provided better performance regarding purity and DNA yield, allowing the detection of a higher number of DNA bands by TTGE in poto poto. By contrast, all three methods yielded similar results for degue samples, indicating that the performance of the DNA extraction method largely depends on the food composition. Sequencing of DNA bands from TTGE gels corresponding to poto poto samples revealed the presence of Lactobacillus gasseri, Enterococcus sp., Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus plantarum/paraplantarum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Bacillus sp., Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus casei. The following bacteria were identified in degue: L. gasseri, Enterococcus sp., E. coli, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus brevis, and L. casei.
TI  - New convenient defined media for [(35)S]methionine labelling and proteomic analyses of probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  - AIMS: To develop experimental conditions for efficient protein radiolabelling and two-dimensional (2D) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for investigation of stress proteomes of probiotic Lactobacillus spp. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three chemically defined media (CDM) optimized from a commercial medium supported rapid growth of the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus E97800, Lactobacillus brevis ATCC 8287 and Lactobacillus reuteri E97849, and a broad range of other lactic acid bacteria. These CDM allowed efficient protein radiolabelling, requiring as little as 200 mul of logarithmic culture and pulse-chase labelling of 20 min to detect c. 300 distinct protein spots in a mini-scale 2D-gel. Proteins including DnaK, GroEL and ClpATPases were identified from the 2D-gels by immunoblotting. CONCLUSIONS: Radiolabelling coupled with 2D gel electrophoresis provides a sensitive means to monitor changes in protein synthesis rates in probistic lactobacilli. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Efficient tools for proteomic analyses of probiotic Lactobacillus were developed and applied for stress-response studies.
TI  - Assessment of adhesion properties of novel probiotic strains to human intestinal  mucus.
AB  - Potential new probiotic strains Lactobacillus brevis PELI, L. reuteri ING1, L. rhamnosus VTT E-800 and L. rhamnosus LC-705 were assessed for their adhesion properties using the human intestinal mucus model. The effect on the adhesion of exposure to acid and pepsin and to milk were tested to simulate gastric and food processing conditions, and the effect of different growth media on adhesion was tested. The properties of the four strains were compared to the well-investigated probiotic L. rhamnosus strain GG. Three of the tested strains showed significant adhesion properties in the mucus model, while L. brevis PELI had intermediate adhesion and L. rhamnosus LC-705 adhered poorly. Pretreatment with different milks decreased the adhesion and low pH and pepsin treatment reduced the adhesion of all tested strains except L. rhamnosus LC-705. No competitive exclusion of pathogenic Salmonella typhimurium or Escherichia coli SfaII was observed. The results indicate that major differences exist between tested proposed probiotic strains. The growth media and the food matrix significantly affect the adhesive ability of the tested strains. This has previously not been taken into account when selecting novel probiotic strains.
TI  - Strain-dependent induction of cytokine profiles in the gut by orally administered Lactobacillus strains.
AB  - Different Lactobacillus strains are frequently used in consumer food products. In addition, recombinant lactobacilli which contain novel expression vectors can now be used in immunotherapeutic applications such as oral vaccination strategies and in T cell tolerance induction approaches for autoimmune disease. Both for food and clinical applications of lactobacilli, proper selection of wild type strains is crucial. For that purpose, eight different common Lactobacillus strains were analysed with respect to mucosal induction of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, IgA-producing plasma cells in the gut, as well as systemic antibody responses against a parenterally administered antigen. Immunohistochemical analysis of cytokine-producing cells in the gut villi showed no significant induction of the cytokines IL-1alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-4 or IL-10 after oral administration of wild type Lactobacillus strains. In contrast, oral administration of L. reuteri and L. brevis induced expression of the proinflammatory/Th1 cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-2 and/or IL-1beta. Oral administration of these two strains and L. fermentum also significantly enhanced the IgG response against parenterally administered haptenated chicken gamma globulin (TNP-CGG). The five other strains did not show this adjuvanticity. L. reuteri induced relatively high levels of IgG2a compared to L. murines, a nonadjuving Lactobacillus strain. These findings imply that different Lactobacillus strains induce distinct mucosal cytokine profiles and possess differential intrinsic adjuvanticity. This suggests that rational Lactobacillus strain selection provides a strategy to influence cytokine expression and thereby influence immune responses.
TI  - Antagonistic activity of bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus species from ogi,  an indigenous fermented food.
AB  - Seven Lactobacillus species each with one or more strains were isolated from various fermented cereal gruel's (ogi). They were identified as L. plantarum (3 strains), L. delbrueckii (1 strain), L. brevis (2 strains), L. reuteri (2 strains), L. casei (1 strain), L. fermentum (1 strain) and L. acidophilus (1 strain). Bacteriocin production was observed in cell-free supernatants of 8 of these strains with L. fermentum, L. delbrueckii and L. reuteri strains (white maize ogi) being negative. The bacteriocin produced by the eight strains inhibited the growth of various target organisms with the inhibition strongly noticed using Enterococcus faecalis as indicator. While catalase treatment, pH changes and heat treatment up to 80 degrees C had no effect on the activity of bacteriocin from these isolates, treatment with trypsin and proteinase K resulted in complete loss of inhibitory activity of the bacteriocins. A reduction in the inhibitory activity of the bacteriocins was also found to occur with increasing concentrations of glucose or peptone in the cultivation medium.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Lactobacillus species against Vibrio species.
AB  - Forty-one Lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of Vibrio. L. plantarum and L. casei were the most effective, and L. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of Vibrio species. L. gasseri and L. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while L. reuteri and L. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against Vibrio species. L. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against Vibrio species. However, none of the Lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of Salmonella enteritidis, S. typhimurium, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus. Inhibition of the Vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the Lactobacillus species.
TI  - Electrophoretic pattern of peptidoglycan hydrolases, a new tool for bacterial species identification: application to 10 Lactobacillus species.
AB  - Lactobacilli have been used as industrial starters for a long time, but in many cases their phenotypic identification is still neither easy nor reliable. Previously we observed that the cell wall peptidoglycan hydrolases of Lactobacillus helveticus were highly conserved enzymes; the aim of the present work was to determine whether peptidoglycan hydrolase patterns obtained by renaturing SDS-PAGE could be of interest in the identification of lactobacilli species. For that purpose, the peptidoglycan hydrolase patterns of 94 strains of lactobacilli belonging to 10 different species were determined; most of the species studied are used either in dairy, meat, bakery or vegetable fermentations: L. helveticus, L. acidophilus, L. delbrueckii, L. brevis, L. fermentum, L. jensenii, L. plantarum, L. sake, L. curvatus and L. reuteri. Within a species, the strains exhibited highly similar patterns: the apparent molecular weights of the lytic bands were identical, with only slight variations of intensity. Moreover, each species, including phylogenetically close species such as L. sake and L. curvatus, or L. acidophilus and L. helveticus, gave a different pattern. Interestingly, the closer the species were phylogenetically, the more related were their patterns. The sensitivity of the method was checked using various quantities of L. acidophilus cells: a peptidoglycan hydrolase extract of 5 x 10(6) cells was sufficient to obtain an informative pattern, as was a single colony. Finally, the method was also successfully applied to distinguish two Carnobacterium species. In conclusion, the electrophoretic pattern of peptidoglycan hydrolases is proposed as a new tool for lactobacilli identification: it is rapid, sensitive and effective even for phylogenetically close species. Furthermore, this work provides the first evidence of the potential overall taxonomic value of bacterial peptidoglycan hydrolases.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria from fermented maize (kenkey)  and their interactions during fermentation.
AB  - A total of 241 lactic acid bacteria belonging to Lactobacillus plantarum, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Lactobacillus fermentum/reuteri and Lactobacillus brevis from various processing stages of maize dough fermentation were investigated. Results indicated that each processing stage has its own microenvironment with strong antimicrobial activity. About half of the Lact. plantarum and practically all of the Lact. fermentum/reuteri investigated were shown to inhibit other Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, explaining the elimination of these organisms during the initial processing stages. Further, widespread microbial interactions amounting to 85% to 18% of all combinations tested were demonstrated amongst lactic acid bacteria within the various processing stages, i.e. raw material, steeping, 0 h and 48 h of fermentation, explaining the microbial succession taking place amongst lactic acid bacteria during fermentation. The antimicrobial effect was explained by the combined effect of acids, compounds sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and other compounds with antimicrobial activity with the acid production being the most important factor. The pattern of antimicrobial factors was not species-specific and the safety and storage stability of fermented maize seem to depend on a mixed population of lactic acid bacteria with different types of antimicrobial characteristics. This means that introduction of pure cultures as starters may impose a risk to the product.
TI  - The formation of biogenic amines by fermentation organisms.
AB  - A total of 523 strains representing 35 species related to food fermentation organisms of practical importance were investigated for their potential for formation of biogenic amines (BA). The investigation was performed with resting cells in phosphate buffer (pH 5.5) and the formation of the following BAs was followed: putrescine, cadaverine, histamine, tyramine and 2-phenylethylamine. No potential was observed in species of lactococcus, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus, Streptococcus and several Lactobacillus spp., such as L. Pentosus and L. sake. A remarkable potential to form BA was observed in strains of carnobacteria, Lactobacillus buchneri, L. curvatus, L. reuteri, Staphylococcus carnosus and, to a lesser extent, in L. alimentarius, L. brevis, L. bavaricus, L. delbrueckii ssp. lactis, Micrococcus spp. and S. piscifermentans. In well known species with a practical function in the fermentation of dairy products, wine or cabbage a potential was observed for few strains only. In view of their role as starters in food fermentation, or their potential use in protective cultures and as probiotics, BA formation by the organisms has to be taken into consideration by selecting appropriate strains.
TI  - Identification of lactobacilli from sourdough and description of Lactobacillus pontis sp. nov.
AB  - The microflora of sourdough preparations was investigated by examining the physiological characteristics, whole-cell protein patterns, and 16S rRNA sequences of Lactobacillus isolates. Strains isolated from sourdough were placed in the species Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus sanfrancisco, and Lactobacillus reuteri. 16S rRNA sequences were determined for L. brevis, Lactobacillus fructivorans, Lactobacillus fermentum, L. sanfrancisco, and L. reuteri, and oligonucleotide probes for fast specific identification of these sourdough lactobacilli were deduced. The physiological characteristics, protein patterns, and 16S rRNA sequences of these organisms were compared with data for other sourdough lactobacilli and additional reference strains. Strains of a Lactobacillus species were isolated from rye sourdough; these strains may account for most of the flora in sourdough made from wheat or rye. These organisms were differentiated from other sourdough lactobacilli by their protein pattern, 16S rRNA sequence, G + C content, and physiological properties. The 16S rRNA sequence of this species was determined, and we constructed a phylogenetic tree which reflected the relationships of this species to other lactobacilli. This organism is closely related to L. reuteri. A new Lactobacillus species, Lactobacillus pontis, is proposed. The type strain is L. pontis LTH 2587 (= DSM 8475 = LMG 14187). We describe a general strategy in which a polyphasic approach was used to characterize a new species.
TI  - Characterization and frequency distribution of species of lactic acid bacteria involved in the processing of mawe, a fermented maize dough from Benin.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria involved in the natural fermentation of both home-produced and commercial mawe were investigated during a 72 h fermentation period. Lactobacillus spp. constitute the majority (94%) of the strains of the lactic acid bacteria isolated, among which 89% represent the Betabacterium group. They include L. fermentum (biotype cellobiosus) (41%), L. fermentum or L. reuteri (19%), L. brevis (26%), L. confusus (less than 2%), L. curvatus (less than 1%) and L. buchneri (less than 1%). Other isolated lactic acid bacteria were L. salivarius, Lactococcus lactis, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Pediococcus acidilactici and Leuconostoc mesenteroides. Several species were detected at the early stage of fermentation, but the final stage was dominated by L. fermentum (biotype cellobiosus) and L. fermentum or L. reuteri totalling 90% of the isolated strains. The trend was the same for both home-produced and commercial mawe. No strains of L. plantarum, generally reported as dominating lactic acid bacteria at the final stage of fermentation of most plant foods, were isolated.
TI  - 1,3-Propanediol:NAD+ oxidoreductases of Lactobacillus brevis and Lactobacillus buchneri.
AB  - In the cofermentation of glycerol with a sugar by Lactobacillus brevis and Lactobacillus buchneri, a 1,3-propanediol:NAD+ oxidoreductase provides an additional method of NADH disposal. The enzyme has been purified from both L. brevis B22 and L. buchneri B190 and found to have properties very similar to those reported for the enzyme from Klebsiella pneumoniae. The enzymes required Mn2+ and are probably octamers with a molecular mass of 350 kDa. Although not absolutely specific for 1,3-propanediol when tested as dehydrogenases, the enzymes have less than 10% activity with glycerol, ethanol, and 1,2-propanediol. These properties contrast sharply with those of a protein isolated from another Lactobacillus species (L. reuteri) that ferments glycerol with glucose and previously designated a 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase.
