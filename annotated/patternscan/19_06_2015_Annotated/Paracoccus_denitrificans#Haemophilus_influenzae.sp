TI  == s-formylglutathione hydrolase of paracoccus denitrificans is homologous to human  esterase d: a universal pathway for formaldehyde detoxification?
AB  == downstream of flha, the paracoccus denitrificans gene encoding glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase, an open reading frame was identified and called fgha. the gene product of fgha showed appreciable similarity with human esterase d and with the deduced amino acid sequences of open reading frames found in escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, and saccharomyces cerevisiae. mutating fgha strongly reduced s-formylglutathione hydrolase activity. the mutant was unable to grow on methanol and methylamine, indicating that the enzyme is essential for methylotrophic growth. s-formylglutathione hydrolase appears to be part of a formaldehyde detoxification pathway that is universal in nature.
