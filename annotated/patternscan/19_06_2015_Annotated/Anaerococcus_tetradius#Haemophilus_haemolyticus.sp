TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == in vitro activity of flurithromycin, a novel macrolide antibiotic.
AB  == flurithromycin is an (8,s)-8-fluoroerythromycin isolated from the fermentation broth of streptomyces erythraeus atcc 31772, a blocked mutant of a strain producer of erythromycin. its in vitro antibacterial activity has been determined on recent clinical isolates of respiratory pathogens. the range of mic for streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus beta-haemolyticus group a is from 0.0015 to 0.006 microgram/ml, for haemophilus influenzae from 0.012 to 0.4 microgram/ml, for staphylococcus aureus from 0.1 to 3.1 micrograms/ml. its action is bacteriostatic and increases at alkaline ph. among anaerobes clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, other species of bacteroides and peptostreptococcus are particularly susceptible. flurithromycin also showed some  activity on mycobacterium bovis, m. scrofulaceum and m. phley. the determination  of killing curves indicated that in most cases a killing effect was obtained at 4 x mic. a combination of flurithromycin with ampicillin or doxycycline sometimes was synergic, but more often additive and never antagonistic. the possible interference of flurithromycin on some parameters of the natural system of defense was determined. at concentrations equal to therapeutic levels in blood and tissues, flurithromycin did not influence chemotaxis, phagocytosis, metabolic activation and the killing activity of neutrophils.
